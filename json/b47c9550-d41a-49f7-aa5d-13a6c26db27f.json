Not because of any fear of drowned worms or wet stockings; I was by and large a grubby child, with a blissful disregard for filth of any kind.</p><p>It was because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to believe that that perfect smooth expanse was no more than a thin film of water over solid earth. I believed it was an opening into some fathomless space. Sometimes, seeing the tiny ripples caused by my approach, I thought the puddle impossibly deep, a bottomless sea in which the lazy coil of tentacle and gleam of scale lay hidden, with the threat of huge bodies and sharp teeth adrift and silent in the far-down depths.</p><p>And then, looking down into reflection, I would see my own round face and frizzled hair against a featureless blue sweep, and think instead that the puddle was the entrance to another sky. If I stepped in there, I would drop at once, and keep on falling, on and on, into blue space.</p> <p>The only time I would dare to walk through a puddle was at twilight, when the evening stars came out. If I looked in the water and saw one lighted pinprick there, I could splash through unafraid\u2014for if I should fall into the puddle and on into space, I could grab hold of the star as I passed, and be safe.</p><p>Even now, when I see a puddle in my path, my mind half-halts\u2014though my feet do not\u2014then hurries on, with only the echo of the thought left behind.</p><p>What if, this time, you fall?</p><p>PART ONE</p><p>Battle, and the Loves of Men</p> <p>1</p><p>THE CORBIES\u2019 FEAST</p><p>Many a Highland chieftain fought,</p><p>Many a gallant man did fall.</p><p>Death itself were dearly bought,</p><p>All for Scotland\u2019s King and law.</p> <p>\u2014\u201cWill Ye No Come Back Again\u201d</p><p>April 16, 1746</p><p>He was dead. However, his nose throbbed painfully, which he thought odd in the circumstances. While he placed considerable trust in the understanding and mercy of his Creator, he harbored that residue of elemental guilt that made all men fear the chance of hell. Still, all he had ever heard of hell made him think it unlikely that the torments reserved for its luckless inhabitants could be restricted to a sore nose.</p><p>On the other hand, this couldn\u2019t be heaven, on several counts. For one, he didn\u2019t deserve it. For another, it didn\u2019t look it. And for a third, he doubted that the rewards of the blessed included a broken nose, any more than those of the damned.</p><p>While he had always thought of Purgatory as a gray sort of place, the faint reddish light that hid everything around him seemed suitable. His mind was clearing a bit, and his power to reason was coming back, if slowly. Someone, he thought rather crossly, ought to see him and tell him just what the sentence was, until he should have suffered enough to be purified, and at last to enter the Kingdom of God. Whether he was expecting a demon or an angel was uncertain. He had no idea of the staffing requirements of Purgatory; it wasn\u2019t a matter the dominie had addressed in his schooldays.</p><p>While waiting, he began to take stock of whatever other torments he might be required to endure. There were numerous cuts, gashes, and bruises here and there, and he was fairly sure he\u2019d broken the fourth finger of his right hand again\u2014difficult to protect it, the way it stuck out so stiff, with the joint frozen. None of that was too bad, though. What else?</p><p>Claire. The name knifed across his heart with a pain that was more racking than anything his body had ever been called on to withstand.</p><p>If he had had an actual body anymore, he was sure it would have doubled up in agony. He had known it would be like this, when he sent her back to the stone circle. Spiritual anguish could be taken as a standard condition in Purgatory, and he had expected all along that the pain of separation would be his chief punishment\u2014sufficient, he thought, to atone for anything he\u2019d ever done: murder and betrayal included.</p> <p>He did not know whether persons in Purgatory were allowed to pray or not, but tried anyway. Lord, he prayed, that she may be safe. She and the child. He was sure she would have made it to the circle itself; only two months gone with child, she was still light and fleet of foot\u2014and the most stubbornly determined woman he had ever met. But whether she had managed the dangerous transition back to the place from which she had come\u2014sliding precariously through whatever mysterious layers lay between then and now, powerless in the grip of the rock\u2014that he could never know, and the thought of it was enough to make him forget even the throbbing in his nose.</p><p>He resumed his interrupted inventory of bodily ills, and became inordinately distressed at the discovery that his left leg appeared to be missing. Sensation stopped at the hip, with a sort of pins-and-needles tingling at the joint. Presumably he would get it back in due time, either when he finally arrived in Heaven, or at the least, at Judgment Day. And after all, his brother-in-law Ian managed very well on the wooden peg he wore to replace his missing leg.</p><p>Still, his vanity was troubled. Ah, that must be it; a punishment meant to cure him of the sin of vanity. He mentally set his teeth, determined to accept whatever came to him with fortitude, and such humility as he could manage. Still, he couldn\u2019t help reaching an exploratory hand (or whatever he was using for a hand) tentatively downward, to see just where the limb now ended.</p><p>The hand struck something hard, and the fingers tangled in wet, snarled hair. He sat up abruptly, and with some effort, cracked the layer of dried blood that had sealed his eyelids shut. Memory flooded back, and he groaned aloud. He had been mistaken. This was hell. But James Fraser was unfortunately not dead, after all.</p><p>The body of a man lay across his own. Its dead weight crushed his left leg, explaining the absence of feeling. The head, heavy as a spent cannonball, pressed facedown into his abdomen, the damp-matted hair a dark spill on the wet linen of his shirt. He jerked upward in sudden panic; the head rolled sideways into his lap and a half-open eye stared sightlessly up behind the sheltering strands of hair.</p><p>It was Jack Randall, his fine red captain\u2019s coat so dark with the wet it looked almost black. Jamie made a fumbling effort to push the body away, but found himself amazingly weak; his hand splayed feebly against Randall\u2019s shoulder, and the elbow of his other arm buckled suddenly as he tried to support himself. He found himself lying once more flat on his back, the sleeting sky pale gray and whirling dizzily overhead. Jack Randall\u2019s head moved obscenely up and down on his stomach with each gasping breath.</p><p>He pressed his hands flat against the boggy ground\u2014the water rose up cold through his fingers and soaked the back of his shirt\u2014and wriggled sideways. Some warmth was trapped between them; as the limp dead weight slid slowly free, the freezing rain struck his newly exposed flesh with a shock like a blow, and he shivered violently with sudden chill.</p><p>As he squirmed on the ground, struggling with the crumpled, mudstained folds of his plaid, he could hear sounds above the keening of the April wind; far-off shouts and a moaning and wailing, like the calling of ghosts in the wind. And overall, the raucous calling of crows. Dozens of crows, from the sound.</p><p>That was strange, he thought dimly. Birds shouldn\u2019t fly in a storm like this. A final heave freed the plaid from under him, and he fumbled it over his body. As he reached to cover his legs, he saw that his kilt and left leg were soaked with blood. The sight didn\u2019t distress him; it seemed only vaguely interesting, the dark red smears a contrast to the grayish green of the moor plants around him. The echoes of battle faded from his ears, and he left Culloden Field to the calling of the crows.</p><p>He was wakened much later by the calling of his name.</p><p>\u201cFraser! Jamie Fraser! Are ye here?\u201d</p><p>No, he thought groggily. I\u2019m not. Wherever he had been while unconscious, it was a better place than this. He lay in a small declivity, half-filled with water. The sleeting rain had stopped, but the wind hadn\u2019t; it whined over the moor, piercing and chilling. The sky had darkened nearly to black; it must be near evening, then.</p><p>\u201cI saw him go down here, I tell ye. Right near a big clump of gorse.\u201d The voice was at a distance, fading as it argued with someone.</p><p>There was a rustle near his ear, and he turned his head to see the crow. It stood on the grass a foot away, a blotch of wind-ruffled black feathers, regarding him with a bead-bright eye. Deciding that he posed no threat, it swiveled its neck with casual ease and jabbed its thick sharp bill into Jack Randall\u2019s eye.</p><p>Jamie jerked up with a cry of revulsion and a flurry of movement that sent the crow flapping off, squawking with alarm.</p><p>\u201cAy! Over there!\u201d</p><p>There was a squelching through boggy ground, and a face before him, and the welcome feel of a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive! Come on, MacDonald! D\u2019ye lend a hand here; he\u2019ll no be walkin\u2019 on his own.\u201d There were four of them, and with a good deal of effort, they got him up, arms draped helpless about the shoulders of Ewan Cameron and Iain MacKinnon.</p><p>He wanted to tell them to leave him; his purpose had returned to him with the waking, and he remembered that he had meant to die. But the sweetness of their company was too much to resist. The rest had restored the feeling in his dead leg, and he knew the seriousness of the wound. He would die soon in any case; thank God that it need not be alone, in the dark.</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d The edge of the cup pressed against his lip, and he roused himself long enough to drink, careful not to spill it. A hand pressed briefly against his forehead and dropped away without comment.</p><p>He was burning; he could feel the flames behind his eyes when he closed them. His lips were cracked and sore from the heat, but it was better than the chills that came at intervals. At least when he was fevered, he could lie still; the shaking of the chills woke the sleeping demons in his leg.</p><p>Murtagh. He had a terrible feeling about his godfather, but no memory to give it shape. Murtagh was dead; he knew that must be it, but didn\u2019t know why or how he knew. A good half of the Highland army was dead, slaughtered on the moor\u2014so much he had gathered from the talk of the men in the farmhouse, but he had no memory of the battle himself.</p><p>He had fought with armies before, and knew such loss of memory was not uncommon in soldiers; he had seen it, though never before suffered it himself. He knew the memories would come back, and hoped he would be dead before they did. He shifted at the thought, and the movement sent a jolt of white-hot pain through his leg that made him groan.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Jamie?\u201d Ewan rose on one elbow next to him, worried face wan in the dawning light. A bloodstained bandage circled his head, and there were rusty stains on his collar, from the scalp wound left by a bullet\u2019s graze.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll do.\u201d He reached up a hand and touched Ewan\u2019s shoulder in gratitude. Ewan patted it, and lay back down.</p><p>The crows were back. Black as night themselves, they had gone to roost with the darkness, but with the dawn they were back\u2014birds of war, the corbies had come to feast on the flesh of the fallen. It could as well be his own eyes the cruel beaks picked out, he thought. He could feel the shape of his eyeballs beneath his lids, round and hot, tasty bits of jelly rolling restless to and fro, looking vainly for oblivion, while the rising sun turned his lids a dark and bloody red.</p><p>Four of the men were gathered near the single window of the farmhouse, talking quietly together.</p><p>\u201cMake a run for it?\u201d one said, with a nod outside. \u201cChrist, man, the best of us can barely stagger\u2014and there\u2019s six at least canna walk at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf ye can go, be going,\u201d said a man from the floor. He grimaced toward his own leg, wrapped in the remains of a tattered quilt. \u201cDinna linger on our account.\u201d</p><p>Duncan MacDonald turned from the window with a grim smile, shaking his head. The window\u2019s light shone off the rough planes of his face, deepening the lines of fatigue.</p><p>\u201cNay, we\u2019ll bide,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one thing, the English are thick as lice on the ground; ye can see them swarm from the window. There\u2019s no man would get away whole from Drumossie now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven those that fled the field yesterday will no get far,\u201d MacKinnon put in softly. \u201cDid ye no hear the English troops passing in the night at the quick-march? D\u2019ye think it will be hard for them to hunt down our ragtag lot?\u201d</p> <p>There was no response to this; all of them knew the answer too well. Many of the Highlanders had been barely able to stand on the field before the battle, weakened as they were by cold, fatigue, and hunger.</p><p>Jamie turned his face to the wall, praying that his men had started early enough. Lallybroch was remote; if they could get far enough from Culloden, it was unlikely they would be caught. And yet Claire had told him that Cumberland\u2019s troops would ravage the Highlands, ranging far afield in their thirst for revenge.</p><p>The thought of her this time caused only a wave of terrible longing. God, to have her here, to lay her hands on him, to tend his wounds and cradle his head in her lap. But she was gone\u2014gone away two hundred years from him\u2014and thank the Lord that she was! Tears trickled slowly from under his closed lids, and he rolled painfully onto his side, to hide them from the others.</p><p>Lord, that she might be safe, he prayed. She and the child.</p><p>Toward midafternoon, the smell of burning came suddenly on the air, wafting through the glassless window. It was thicker than the smell of blackpowder smoke, pungent, with an underlying odor that was faintly horrible in its reminiscent smell of roasting meat.</p> <p>\u201cThey are burning the dead,\u201d said MacDonald. He had scarcely moved from his seat by the window in all the time they had been in the cottage. He looked like a death\u2019s-head himself, hair coal-black and matted with dirt, scraped back from a face in which every bone showed.</p><p>Here and there, a small, flat crack sounded on the moor. Gunshots. The coups de grace, administered by those English officers with a sense of compassion, before a tartan-clad wretch should be stacked on the pyre with his luckier fellows. When Jamie looked up, Duncan MacDonald still sat by the window, but his eyes were closed.</p><p>Next to him, Ewan Cameron crossed himself. \u201cMay we find as much mercy,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>They did. It was just past noon on the second day when booted feet at last approached the farmhouse, and the door swung open on silent leather hinges.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d It was a muttered exclamation at the sight within the farmhouse. The draft from the door stirred the fetid air over grimed, bedraggled, bloodstained bodies that lay or sat huddled on the packed-dirt floor.</p><p>There had been no discussion of the possibility of armed resistance; they had no heart and there was no point. The Jacobites simply sat, waiting the pleasure of their visitor.</p> <p>He was a major, all fresh and new in an uncreased uniform, with polished boots. After a moment\u2019s hesitation to survey the inhabitants, he stepped inside, his lieutenant close behind.</p><p>\u201cI am Lord Melton,\u201d he said, glancing around as though seeking the leader of these men, to whom his remarks might most properly be addressed.</p><p>Duncan MacDonald, after a glance of his own, stood slowly, and inclined his head. \u201cDuncan MacDonald, of Glen Richie,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd others\u201d\u2014he waved a hand\u2014\u201clate of the forces of His Majesty, King James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I surmised,\u201d the Englishman said dryly. He was young, in his early thirties, but he carried himself with a seasoned soldier\u2019s confidence. He looked deliberately from man to man, then reached into his coat and produced a folded sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cI have here an order from His Grace, the Duke of Cumberland,\u201d he said. \u201cAuthorizing the immediate execution of any man found to have engaged in the treasonous rebellion just past.\u201d He glanced around the confines of the cottage once more. \u201cIs there any man here who claims innocence of treason?\u201d</p><p>There was the faintest breath of laughter from the Scots. Innocence, with the smoke of battle still black on their faces, here on the edge of the slaughter-field?</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord,\u201d said MacDonald, the faintest of smiles on his lips. \u201cTraitors all. Shall we be hanged, then?\u201d</p><p>Melton\u2019s face twitched in a small grimace of distaste, then settled back into impassivity. He was a slight man, with small, fine bones, but carried his authority well, nonetheless.</p> <p>\u201cYou will be shot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have an hour, in which to prepare yourselves.\u201d He hesitated, shooting a glance at his lieutenant, as though afraid to sound overgenerous before his subordinate, but continued. \u201cIf any of you wish writing materials\u2014to compose a letter, perhaps\u2014the clerk of my company will attend you.\u201d He nodded briefly to MacDonald, turned on his heel, and left.</p><p>It was a grim hour. A few men availed themselves of the offer of pen and ink, and scribbled doggedly, paper held against the slanted wooden chimney for lack of another firm writing surface. Others prayed quietly, or simply sat, waiting.</p><p>MacDonald had begged mercy for Giles McMartin and Frederick Murray, arguing that they were barely seventeen, and should not be held to the same account as their elders. This request was denied, and the boys sat together, white-faced against the wall, holding each other\u2019s hands.</p><p>For them, Jamie felt a piercing sorrow\u2014and for the others here, loyal friends and gallant soldiers. For himself, he felt only relief. No more to worry, nothing more to do. He had done all he could for his men, his wife, his unborn child. Now let this bodily misery be ended, and he would go grateful for the peace of it.</p><p>More for form\u2019s sake than because he felt the need of it, he closed his eyes and began the Act of Contrition, in French, as he always said it. Mon Dieu, je regrette...And yet he didn\u2019t; it was much too late for any sort of regret.</p><p>Would he find Claire at once when he died, he wondered? Or perhaps, as he expected, be condemned to separation for a time? In any case, he would see her again; he clung to the conviction much more firmly than he embraced the tenets of the Church. God had given her to him; He would restore her.</p><p>Forgetting to pray, he instead began to conjure her face behind his eyelids, the curve of cheek and temple, a broad fair brow that always moved him to kiss it, just there, in that small smooth spot between her eyebrows, just at the top of her nose, between clear amber eyes. He fixed his attention on the shape of her mouth, carefully imagining the full, sweet curve of it, and the taste and the feel and the joy of it. The sounds of praying, the pen-scratching and the small, choked sobs of Giles McMartin faded from his ears.</p><p>It was midafternoon when Melton returned, this time with six soldiers in attendance, as well as the Lieutenant and the clerk. Again, he paused in the doorway, but MacDonald rose before he could speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d he said, and walked steadily across the cottage. As he bent his head to go through the door, though, Lord Melton laid a hand on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWill you give your full name, sir? My clerk will make note of it.\u201d</p><p>MacDonald glanced at the clerk, a small bitter smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cA trophy list, is it? Aye, well.\u201d He shrugged and drew himself upright. \u201cDuncan William MacLeod MacDonald, of Glen Richie.\u201d He bowed politely to Lord Melton. \u201cAt your service\u2014sir.\u201d He passed through the door, and shortly there came the sound of a single pistol-shot from near at hand.</p><p>The boys were allowed to go together, hands still clutched tightly as they passed through the door. The rest were taken one by one, each asked for his name, that the clerk might make a record of it. The clerk sat on a stool by the door, head bent to the papers in his lap, not looking up as the men passed by.</p><p>When it came Ewan\u2019s turn, Jamie struggled to prop himself on his elbows, and grasped his friend\u2019s hand, as hard as he could.</p><p>\u201cI shall see ye soon again,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ewan\u2019s hand shook in his, but the Cameron only smiled. Then he leaned across simply and kissed Jamie\u2019s mouth, and rose to go.</p><p>They left the six who could not walk to the last.</p><p>\u201cJames Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser,\u201d he said, speaking slowly to allow the clerk time to get it down right. \u201cLaird of Broch Tuarach.\u201d Patiently, he spelled it, then glanced up at Melton.</p><p>\u201cI must ask your courtesy, my lord, to give me help to stand.\u201d</p><p>Melton didn\u2019t answer him, but stared down at him, his expression of remote distaste altering to one of mingled astonishment and something like dawning horror.</p><p>\u201cFraser?\u201d he said. \u201cOf Broch Tuarach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jamie said patiently. Would the man not hurry a bit? Being resigned to being shot was one thing, but listening to your friends being killed in your hearing was another, and not just calculated to settle the nerves. His arms were trembling with the strain of propping him, and his bowels, not sharing the resignation of his higher faculties, were twitching with a gurgling dread.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d the Englishman muttered. He bent and peered at Jamie where he lay in the shadow of the wall, then turned and beckoned to his lieutenant.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get him into the light,\u201d he ordered. They weren\u2019t gentle about it, and Jamie grunted as the movement sent a bolt of pain from his leg right up through the top of his head. It made him dizzy for a moment, and he missed what Melton was saying to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you the Jacobite they call \u2018Red Jamie\u2019?\u201d he asked again, impatiently.</p><p>A streak of fear went through Jamie at that; let them know he was the notorious Red Jamie, and they wouldn\u2019t shoot him. They\u2019d take him in chains to London to be tried\u2014a prize of war. And after that, it would be the hangman\u2019s rope, and lying half strangled on the gallows platform while they slit his belly and ripped out his bowels. His bowels gave another long, rumbling gurgle; they didn\u2019t think much of the notion either.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, with as much firmness as he could manage. \u201cJust get on wi\u2019 it, eh?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring this, Melton dropped to his knees, and ripped open the throat of Jamie\u2019s shirt. He gripped Jamie\u2019s hair and jerked back his head.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Melton said. Melton\u2019s finger prodded him in the throat, just above the collarbone. There was a small triangular scar there, and this appeared to be what was causing his interrogator\u2019s concern.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser of Broch Tuarach; red hair and a three-cornered scar on his throat.\u201d Melton let go of the hair and sat back on his heels, rubbing his chin in a distracted sort of way. Then he pulled himself together and turned to the lieutenant, gesturing at the five men remaining in the farm cottage.</p><p>\u201cTake the rest,\u201d he ordered. His fair brows were knitted together in a deep frown. He stood over Jamie, scowling, while the other Scottish prisoners were removed.</p><p>\u201cI have to think,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDamme, I must think!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo that,\u201d said Jamie, \u201cif you\u2019re able. I must lie down, myself.\u201d They had propped him sitting against the far wall, his leg stretched out in front of him, but sitting upright after two days of lying flat was more than he could manage; the room was tilting drunkenly, and small flashing lights kept coming before his eyes. He leaned to one side, and eased himself down, hugging the dirt floor, eyes closed as he waited for the dizziness to pass.</p><p>Melton was muttering under his breath, but Jamie couldn\u2019t make out the words; didn\u2019t care greatly in any case. Sitting up in the sunlight, he had seen his leg clearly for the first time, and he was fairly sure that he wouldn\u2019t live long enough to be hanged.</p><p>The deep angry red of inflammation spread from midthigh upward, much brighter than the remaining smears of dried blood. The wound itself was purulent; with the stench of the other men lessening, he could smell the faint sweet-foul odor of the discharge. Still, a quick bullet through the head seemed much preferable to the pain and delirium of death by infection. Did you hear the bang? he wondered, and drifted off, the cool pounded dirt smooth and comforting as a mother\u2019s breast under his hot cheek.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t really asleep, only drifting in a feverish doze, but Melton\u2019s voice in his ear jerked him to alertness.</p> <p>\u201cGrey,\u201d the voice was saying, \u201cJohn William Grey! Do you know that name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, mazy with sleep and fever. \u201cLook, man, either shoot me or go away, aye? I\u2019m ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear Carryarrick.\u201d Melton\u2019s voice was prodding, impatient. \u201cA boy, a fair-haired boy, about sixteen. You met him in the wood.\u201d</p><p>Jamie squinted up at his tormentor. The fever distorted his vision, but there seemed something vaguely familiar about the fine-boned face above him, with those large, almost girlish eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, catching a single face from the flood of images that swirled erratically through his brain. \u201cThe wee laddie that tried to kill me. Aye, I mind him.\u201d He closed his eyes again. In the odd way of fever, one sensation seemed to blend into another. He had broken John William Grey\u2019s arm; the memory of the boy\u2019s fine bone beneath his hand became the bone of Claire\u2019s forearm as he tore her from the grip of the stones. The cool misty breeze stroked his face with Claire\u2019s fingers.</p> <p>\u201cWake up, damn you!\u201d His head snapped on his neck as Melton shook him impatiently. \u201cListen to me!\u201d</p><p>Jamie opened his eyes wearily. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn William Grey is my brother,\u201d Melton said. \u201cHe told me of his meeting with you. You spared his life, and he made you a promise\u2014is that true?\u201d</p><p>With great effort, he cast his mind back. He had met the boy two days before the first battle of the rebellion; the Scottish victory at Prestonpans. The six months between then and now seemed a vast chasm; so much had happened in between.</p><p>\u201cAye, I recall. He promised to kill me. I dinna mind if you do it for him, though.\u201d His eyelids were drooping again. Did he have to be awake in order to be shot?</p><p>\u201cHe said he owed you a debt of honor, and he does.\u201d Melton stood up, dusting the knees of his breeches, and turned to his lieutenant, who had been watching the questioning with considerable bewilderment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the deuce of a situation, Wallace. This...this Jacobite scut is famous. You\u2019ve heard of Red Jamie? The one on the broadsheets?\u201d The Lieutenant nodded, looking curiously down at the bedraggled form in the dirt at his feet. Melton smiled bitterly.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t look so dangerous now, does he? But he\u2019s still Red Jamie Fraser, and His Grace would be more than pleased to hear of such an illustrious prisoner. They haven\u2019t yet found Charles Stuart, but a few well-known Jacobites would please the crowds at Tower Hill nearly as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I send a message to His Grace?\u201d The Lieutenant reached for his message box.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Melton wheeled to glare down at his prisoner. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficulty! Besides being prime gallows bait, this filthy wretch is also the man who captured my youngest brother near Preston, and rather than shooting the brat, which is what he deserved, spared his life and returned him to his companions. Thus,\u201d he said through his teeth, \u201cincurring a bloody great debt of honor upon my family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d said the Lieutenant. \u201cSo you can\u2019t give him to His Grace, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, blast it! I can\u2019t even shoot the bastard, without dishonoring my brother\u2019s sworn word!\u201d</p><p>The prisoner opened one eye. \u201cI willna tell anyone if you don\u2019t,\u201d he suggested, and promptly closed it again.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Losing his temper entirely, Melton kicked the prisoner, who grunted at the impact, but said nothing more.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps we could shoot him under an assumed name,\u201d the Lieutenant suggested helpfully.</p><p>Lord Melton gave his aide a look of withering scorn, then looked out the window to judge the time.</p><p>\u201cIt will be dark in three hours. I\u2019ll oversee the burial of the other executed prisoners. Find a small wagon, and have it filled with hay. Find a driver\u2014pick someone discreet, Wallace, that means bribable, Wallace\u2014and have them here as soon as it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Er, sir? What about the prisoner?\u201d The Lieutenant gestured diffidently toward the body on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Melton said brusquely. \u201cHe\u2019s too weak to crawl, let alone walk. He isn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014at least not until the wagon gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWagon?\u201d The prisoner was showing signs of life. In fact, under the stimulus of agitation, he had managed to raise himself onto one arm. Bloodshot blue eyes gleamed wide with alarm, under the spikes of matted red hair. \u201cWhere are ye sending me?\u201d Turning from the door, Melton cast him a glance of intense dislike.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the laird of Broch Tuarach, aren\u2019t you? Well, that\u2019s where I\u2019m sending you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna want to go home! I want to be shot!\u201d</p><p>The Englishmen exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cRaving,\u201d the Lieutenant said significantly, and Melton nodded.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll live through the journey\u2014but his death won\u2019t be on my head, at least.\u201d</p><p>The door shut firmly behind the Englishmen, leaving Jamie Fraser quite alone\u2014and still alive.</p><p>2</p><p>THE HUNT BEGINS</p><p>Inverness</p><p>May 2, 1968</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s dead!\u201d Claire\u2019s voice was sharp with agitation; it rang loudly in the half-empty study, echoing among the rifled bookshelves. She stood against the cork-lined wall like a prisoner awaiting a firing squad, staring from her daughter to Roger Wakefield and back again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Roger felt terribly tired. He rubbed a hand over his face, then picked up the folder from the desk; the one containing all the research he\u2019d done since Claire and her daughter had first come to him, three weeks before, and asked his help.</p><p>He opened the folder and thumbed slowly through the contents. The Jacobites of Culloden. The Rising of the \u201945. The gallant Scots who had rallied to the banner of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and cut through Scotland like a blazing sword\u2014only to come to ruin and defeat against the Duke of Cumberland on the gray moor at Culloden.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, plucking out several sheets clipped together. The archaic writing looked odd, rendered in the black crispness of a photocopy. \u201cThis is the muster roll of the Master of Lovat\u2019s regiment.\u201d</p><p>He thrust the thin sheaf of papers at Claire, but it was her daughter, Brianna, who took the sheets from him and began to turn the pages, a slight frown between her reddish brows.</p><p>\u201cRead the top sheet,\u201d Roger said. \u201cWhere it says \u2018Officers.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u2018Officers,\u2019\u201d she read aloud, \u201c\u2018Simon, Master of Lovat\u2019...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Young Fox,\u201d Roger interrupted. \u201cLovat\u2019s son. And five more names, right?\u201d</p><p>Brianna cocked one brow at him, but went on reading.</p><p>\u201c\u2018William Chisholm Fraser, Lieutenant; George D\u2019Amerd Fraser Shaw, Captain; Duncan Joseph Fraser, Lieutenant; Bayard Murray Fraser, Major,\u201d she paused, swallowing, before reading the last name, \u201c\u2018...James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser. Captain.\u2019\u201d She lowered the papers, looking a little pale. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>Claire moved quickly to her daughter\u2019s side, squeezing the girl\u2019s arm. She was pale, too.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said to Roger. \u201cI know he went to Culloden. When he left me...there at the stone circle...he meant to go back to Culloden Field, to rescue his men who were with Charles Stuart. And we know he did\u201d\u2014she nodded at the folder on the desk, its manila surface blank and innocent in the lamplight\u2014\u201cyou found their names. But...but...Jamie...\u201d Speaking the name aloud seemed to rattle her, and she clamped her lips tight.</p><p>Now it was Brianna\u2019s turn to support her mother.</p><p>\u201cHe meant to go back, you said.\u201d Her eyes, dark blue and encouraging, were intent on her mother\u2019s face. \u201cHe meant to take his men away from the field, and then go back to the battle.\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded, recovering herself slightly.</p><p>\u201cHe knew he hadn\u2019t much chance of getting away; if the English caught him...he said he\u2019d rather die in battle. That\u2019s what he meant to do.\u201d She turned to Roger, her gaze an unsettling amber. Her eyes always reminded him of hawk\u2019s eyes, as though she could see a good deal farther than most people. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t die there\u2014so many men did, and he meant to!\u201d</p><p>Almost half the Highland army had died at Culloden, cut down in a blast of cannonfire and searing musketry. But not Jamie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said doggedly. \u201cThat bit I read you from Linklater\u2019s book\u2014\u201d He reached to pick it up, a white volume, entitled The Prince in the Heather.</p><p>\u201cFollowing the battle,\u201d he read, \u201ceighteen wounded Jacobite officers took refuge in the farmhouse near the moor. Here they lay in pain, their wounds untended, for two days. At the end of that time, they were taken out and shot. One man, a Fraser of the Master of Lovat\u2019s regiment, escaped the slaughter. The rest are buried at the edge of the domestic park.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said, laying the book down and looking earnestly at the two women over its pages. \u201cAn officer, of the Master of Lovat\u2019s regiment.\u201d He grabbed up the sheets of the muster roll.</p><p>\u201cAnd here they are! Just six of them. Now, we know the man in the farmhouse can\u2019t have been Young Simon; he\u2019s a well-known historical figure, and we know very well what happened to him. He retreated from the field\u2014unwounded, mind you\u2014with a group of his men, and fought his way north, eventually making it back to Beaufort Castle, near here.\u201d He waved vaguely at the full-length window, through which the nighttime lights of Inverness twinkled faintly.</p><p>\u201cNor was the man who escaped Leanach farmhouse any of the other four officers\u2014William, George, Duncan, or Bayard,\u201d Roger said. \u201cWhy?\u201d He snatched another paper out of the folder and brandished it, almost triumphantly. \u201cBecause they all did die at Culloden! All four of them were killed on the field\u2014I found their names listed on a plaque in the church at Beauly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire let out a long breath, then eased herself down into the old leather swivel chair behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ,\u201d she said. She closed her eyes and leaned forward, elbows on the desk, and her head against her hands, the thick, curly brown hair spilling forward to hide her face. Brianna laid a hand on Claire\u2019s back, face troubled as she bent over her mother. She was a tall girl, with large, fine bones, and her long red hair glowed in the warm light of the desk lamp.</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t die...\u201d she began tentatively.</p><p>Claire\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cBut he is dead!\u201d she said. Her face was strained, and small lines were visible around her eyes. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s two hundred years; whether he died at Culloden or not, he\u2019s dead now!\u201d</p> <p>Brianna stepped back from her mother\u2019s vehemence, and lowered her head, so the red hair\u2014her father\u2019s red hair\u2014swung down beside her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she whispered. Roger could see she was fighting back tears. And no wonder, he thought. To find out in short order that first, the man you had loved and called \u201cFather\u201d all your life really wasn\u2019t your father, secondly, that your real father was a Highland Scot who had lived two hundred years ago, and thirdly, to realize that he had likely perished in some horrid fashion, unthinkably far from the wife and child he had sacrificed himself to save...enough to rattle one, Roger thought.</p><p>He crossed to Brianna and touched her arm. She gave him a brief, distracted glance, and tried to smile. He put his arms around her, even in his pity for her distress thinking how marvelous she felt, all warm and soft and springy at once.</p><p>Claire still sat at the desk, motionless. The yellow hawk\u2019s eyes had gone a softer color now, remote with memory. They rested sightlessly on the east wall of the study, still covered from floor to ceiling with the notes and memorabilia left by the Reverend Wakefield, Roger\u2019s late adoptive father.</p><p>Looking at the wall himself, Roger saw the annual meeting notice sent by the Society of the White Rose\u2014those enthusiastic, eccentric souls who still championed the cause of Scottish independence, meeting in nostalgic tribute to Charles Stuart, and the Highland heroes who had followed him.</p> <p>Roger cleared his throat slightly.</p><p>\u201cEr...if Jamie Fraser didn\u2019t die at Culloden...\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen he likely died soon afterward.\u201d Claire\u2019s eyes met Roger\u2019s, straight on, the cool look back in the yellow-brown depths. \u201cYou have no idea how it was,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a famine in the Highlands\u2014none of the men had eaten for days before the battle. He was wounded\u2014we know that. Even if he escaped, there would have been...no one to care for him.\u201d Her voice caught slightly at that; she was a doctor now, had been a healer even then, twenty years before, when she had stepped through a circle of standing stones, and met destiny with James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.</p><p>Roger was conscious of them both; the tall, shaking girl he held in his arms, and the woman at the desk, so still, so poised. She had traveled through the stones, through time; been suspected as a spy, arrested as a witch, snatched by an unimaginable quirk of circumstance from the arms of her first husband, Frank Randall. And three years later, her second husband, James Fraser, had sent her back through the stones, pregnant, in a desperate effort to save her and the unborn child from the onrushing disaster that would soon engulf him.</p><p>Surely, he thought to himself, she\u2019s been through enough? But Roger was a historian. He had a scholar\u2019s insatiable, amoral curiosity, too powerful to be constrained by simple compassion. More than that, he was oddly conscious of the third figure in the family tragedy in which he found himself involved\u2014Jamie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t die at Culloden,\u201d he began again, more firmly, \u201cthen perhaps I can find out what did happen to him. Do you want me to try?\u201d He waited, breathless, feeling Brianna\u2019s warm breath through his shirt.</p> <p>Jamie Fraser had had a life, and a death. Roger felt obscurely that it was his duty to find out all the truth; that Jamie Fraser\u2019s women deserved to know all they could of him. For Brianna, such knowledge was all she would ever have of the father she had never known. And for Claire\u2014behind the question he had asked was the thought that had plainly not yet struck her, stunned with shock as she was: she had crossed the barrier of time twice before. She could, just possibly, do it again. And if Jamie Fraser had not died at Culloden...</p><p>He saw awareness flicker in the clouded amber of her eyes, as the thought came to her. She was normally pale; now her face blanched white as the ivory handle of the letter opener before her on the desk. Her fingers closed around it, clenching so the knuckles stood out in knobs of bone.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak for a long time. Her gaze fixed on Brianna and lingered there for a moment, then returned to Roger\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, in a whisper so soft he could barely hear her. \u201cYes. Find out for me. Please. Find out.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>FRANK AND FULL DISCLOSURE</p><p>Inverness</p><p>May 9, 1968</p> <p>The foot traffic was heavy on the bridge over the River Ness, with folk streaming home to their teas. Roger moved in front of me, his wide shoulders protecting me from the buffets of the crowd around us.</p><p>I could feel my heart beating heavily against the stiff cover of the book I was clutching to my chest. It did that whenever I paused to think what we were truly doing. I wasn\u2019t sure which of the two possible alternatives was worse; to find that Jamie had died at Culloden, or to find that he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>The boards of the bridge echoed hollowly underfoot, as we trudged back toward the manse. My arms ached from the weight of the books I carried, and I shifted the load from one side to the other.</p><p>\u201cWatch your bloody wheel, man!\u201d Roger shouted, nudging me adroitly to the side, as a workingman on a bicycle plowed head-downward through the bridge traffic, nearly running me against the railing.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d came back the apologetic shout, and the rider gave a wave of the hand over his shoulder, as the bike wove its way between two groups of schoolchildren, coming home for their teas. I glanced back across the bridge, in case Brianna should be visible behind us, but there was no sign of her.</p><p>Roger and I had spent the afternoon at the Society for the Preservation of Antiquities. Brianna had gone down to the Highland Clans office, there to collect photocopies of a list of documents Roger had compiled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to take all this trouble, Roger,\u201d I said, raising my voice to be heard above the echoing bridge and the river\u2019s rush.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, a little awkwardly, pausing for me to catch him up. \u201cI\u2019m curious,\u201d he added, smiling a little. \u201cYou know historians\u2014can\u2019t leave a puzzle alone.\u201d He shook his head, trying to brush the windblown dark hair out of his eyes without using his hands.</p><p>I did know historians. I\u2019d lived with one for twenty years. Frank hadn\u2019t wanted to leave this particular puzzle alone, either. But neither had he been willing to solve it. Frank had been dead for two years, though, and now it was my turn\u2014mine and Brianna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard yet from Dr. Linklater?\u201d I asked, as we came down the arch of the bridge. Late in the afternoon as it was, the sun was still high, so far north as we were. Caught among the leaves of the lime trees on the riverbank, it glowed pink on the granite cenotaph that stood below the bridge.</p><p>Roger shook his head, squinting against the wind. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s been only a week since I wrote. If I don\u2019t hear by the Monday, I\u2019ll try telephoning. Don\u2019t worry\u201d\u2014he smiled sideways at me\u2014\u201cI was very circumspect. I just told him that for purposes of a study I was making, I needed a list\u2014if one existed\u2014of the Jacobite officers who were in Leanach farmhouse after Culloden, and if any information exists as to the survivor of that execution, could he refer me to the original sources?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Linklater?\u201d I asked, easing my left arm by tilting the books sideways against my hip.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wrote my request on the Balliol College letterhead, and made tactful reference to Mr. Cheesewright, my old tutor, who does know Link-later.\u201d Roger winked reassuringly, and I laughed.</p><p>His eyes were a brilliant, lucent green, bright against his olive skin. Curiosity might be his stated reason for helping us to find out Jamie\u2019s history, but I was well aware that his interest went a good bit deeper\u2014in the direction of Brianna. I also knew that the interest was returned. What I didn\u2019t know was whether Roger realized that as well.</p><p>Back in the late Reverend Wakefield\u2019s study, I dropped my armload of books on the table in relief, and collapsed into the wing chair by the hearth, while Roger went to fetch a glass of lemonade from the manse\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>My breathing slowed as I sipped the tart sweetness, but my pulse stayed erratic, as I looked over the imposing stack of books we had brought back. Was Jamie in there somewhere? And if he was...my hands grew wet on the cold glass, and I choked the thought off. Don\u2019t look too far ahead, I cautioned myself. Much better to wait, and see what we might find.</p><p>Roger was scanning the shelves in the study, in search of other possibilities. The Reverend Wakefield, Roger\u2019s late adoptive father, had been both a good amateur historian, and a terrible pack rat; letters, journals, pamphlets and broadsheets, antique and contemporary volumes\u2014all were crammed cheek by jowl together on the shelves.</p><p>Roger hesitated, then his hand fell on a stack of books sitting on the nearby table. They were Frank\u2019s books\u2014an impressive achievement, so far as I could tell by reading the encomiums printed on the dust jackets.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever read this?\u201d he asked, picking up the volume entitled The Jacobites.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I took a restorative gulp of lemonade, and coughed. \u201cNo,\u201d I said again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d After my return, I had resolutely refused to look at any material dealing with Scotland\u2019s past, even though the eighteenth century had been one of Frank\u2019s areas of specialty. Knowing Jamie dead, and faced with the necessity of living without him, I avoided anything that might bring him to mind. A useless avoidance\u2014there was no way of keeping him out of my mind, with Brianna\u2019s existence a daily reminder of him\u2014but still, I could not read books about the Bonnie Prince\u2014that terrible, futile young man\u2014or his followers.</p><p>\u201cI see. I just thought you might know whether there might be something useful in here.\u201d Roger paused, the flush deepening over his cheekbones. \u201cDid\u2014er, did your husband\u2014Frank, I mean,\u201d he added hastily. \u201cDid you tell him...um...about...\u201d His voice trailed off, choked with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I did!\u201d I said, a little sharply. \u201cWhat did you think\u2014I\u2019d just stroll back into his office after being gone for three years and say, \u2018Oh, hullo there, darling, and what would you like for supper tonight?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Roger muttered. He turned away, eyes fixed on the bookshelves. The back of his neck was deep red with embarrassment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair question to ask. It\u2019s only that it\u2019s\u2014a bit raw, yet.\u201d A good deal more than a bit. I was both surprised and appalled to find just how raw the wound still was. I set the glass down on the table at my elbow. If we were going on with this, I was going to need something stronger than lemonade.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI told him. All about the stones\u2014about Jamie. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Roger didn\u2019t reply for a moment. Then he turned, halfway, so that only the strong, sharp lines of his profile were visible. He didn\u2019t look at me, but down at the stack of Frank\u2019s books, at the back-cover photo of Frank, leanly dark and handsome, smiling for posterity.</p><p>\u201cDid he believe you?\u201d Roger asked quietly.</p> <p>My lips felt sticky from the lemonade, and I licked them before answering.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNot at first. He thought I was mad; even had me vetted by a psychiatrist.\u201d I laughed, shortly, but the memory made me clench my fists with remembered fury.</p><p>\u201cLater, then?\u201d Roger turned to face me. The flush had faded from his skin, leaving only an echo of curiosity in his eyes. \u201cWhat did he think?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The tiny hospital in Inverness smelled unfamiliar, like carbolic disinfectant and starch.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t think, and tried not to feel. The return was much more terrifying than my venture into the past had been, for there, I had been shrouded by a protective layer of doubt and disbelief about where I was and what was happening, and had lived in constant hope of escape. Now I knew only too well where I was, and I knew that there was no escape. Jamie was dead.</p><p>The doctors and nurses tried to speak kindly to me, to feed me and bring me things to drink, but there was no room in me for anything but grief and terror. I had told them my name when they asked, but wouldn\u2019t speak further.</p><p>I lay in the clean white bed, fingers clamped tight together over my vulnerable belly, and kept my eyes shut. I visualized over and over the last things I had seen before I stepped through the stones\u2014the rainy moor and Jamie\u2019s face\u2014knowing that if I looked too long at my new surroundings, these sights would fade, replaced by mundane things like the nurses and the vase of flowers by my bed. I pressed one thumb secretly against the base of the other, taking an obscure comfort in the tiny wound there, a small cut in the shape of a J. Jamie had made it, at my demand\u2014the last of his touch on my flesh.</p><p>I must have stayed that way for some time; I slept sometimes, dreaming of the last few days of the Jacobite Rising\u2014I saw again the dead man in the wood, asleep beneath a coverlet of bright blue fungus, and Dougal MacKenzie dying on the floor of an attic in Culloden House; the ragged men of the Highland army, asleep in the muddy ditches; their last sleep before the slaughter.</p><p>I would wake screaming or moaning, to the scent of disinfectant and the sound of soothing words, incomprehensible against the echoes of Gaelic shouting in my dreams, and fall asleep again, my hurt clutched tight in the palm of my hand.</p><p>And then I opened my eyes and Frank was there. He stood in the door, smoothing back his dark hair with one hand, looking uncertain\u2014and no wonder, poor man.</p> <p>I lay back on the pillows, just watching him, not speaking. He had the look of his ancestors, Jack and Alex Randall; fine, clear, aristocratic features and a well-shaped head, under a spill of straight dark hair. His face had some indefinable difference from theirs, though, beyond the small differences of feature. There was no mark of fear or ruthlessness on him; neither the spirituality of Alex nor the icy arrogance of Jack. His lean face looked intelligent, kind, and slightly tired, unshaven and with smudges beneath his eyes. I knew without being told that he had driven all night to get here.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d He came over to the bed, and spoke tentatively, as though not sure that I really was Claire.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure either, but I nodded and said, \u201cHullo, Frank.\u201d My voice was scratchy and rough, unaccustomed to speech.</p><p>He took one of my hands, and I let him have it.</p><p>\u201cAre you...all right?\u201d he said, after a minute. He was frowning slightly as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d That seemed the important point, to my disordered mind. I had not thought of what I would say to Frank, if I ever saw him again, but the moment I saw him standing in the door, it seemed to come clear in my mind. I would tell him I was pregnant, he would leave, and I would be alone with my last sight of Jamie\u2019s face, and the burning touch of him on my hand.</p><p>His face tightened a bit, but he didn\u2019t let go of my other hand. \u201cI know. They told me.\u201d He took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cClaire\u2014can you tell me what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I felt quite blank for a moment, but then shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I said. I mustered my thoughts wearily; I didn\u2019t want to be talking about it, but I had some feeling of obligation to this man. Not guilt, not yet; but obligation nonetheless. I had been married to him.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI fell in love with someone else, and I married him. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I added, in response to the look of shock that crossed his face, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been expecting that. His mouth opened and closed for a bit and he gripped my hand, hard enough to make me wince and jerk it out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he said, his voice sharp. \u201cWhere have you been, Claire?\u201d He stood up suddenly, looming over the bed.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that when I last saw you, I was going up to the stone circle on Craigh na Dun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He was staring down at me with an expression somewhere between anger and suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWell\u201d\u2014I licked my lips, which had gone quite dry\u2014\u201cthe fact is, I walked through a cleft stone in that circle, and ended up in 1743.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be facetious, Claire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m being funny?\u201d The thought was so absurd that I actually began to laugh, though I felt a good long way from real humor.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d</p><p>I quit laughing. Two nurses appeared at the door as though by magic; they must have been lurking in the hall nearby. Frank leaned over and grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cYou are going to tell me where you\u2019ve been and what you\u2019ve been doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am telling you! Let go!\u201d I sat up in bed and yanked at my arm, pulling it out of his grasp. \u201cI told you; I walked through a stone and ended up two hundred years ago. And I met your bloody ancestor, Jack Randall, there!\u201d</p><p>Frank blinked, entirely taken aback. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack Jack Randall, and a bloody, filthy, nasty pervert he was, too!\u201d</p><p>Frank\u2019s mouth hung open, and so did the nurses\u2019. I could hear feet coming down the corridor behind them, and hurried voices.</p><p>\u201cI had to marry Jamie Fraser to get away from Jack Randall, but then\u2014Jamie\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it, Frank, I loved him and I would have stayed with him if I could, but he sent me back because of Culloden, and the baby, and\u2014\u201d I broke off, as a man in a doctor\u2019s uniform pushed past the nurses by the door.</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d I said tiredly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it to happen, and I tried all I could to come back\u2014really, I did\u2014but I couldn\u2019t. And now it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Despite myself, tears began to well up in my eyes and roll down my cheeks. Mostly for Jamie, and myself, and the child I carried, but a few for Frank as well. I sniffed hard and swallowed, trying to stop, and pushed myself upright in the bed.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, \u201cI know you won\u2019t want to have anything more to do with me, and I don\u2019t blame you at all. Just\u2014just go away, will you?\u201d</p><p>His face had changed. He didn\u2019t look angry anymore, but distressed, and slightly puzzled. He sat down by the bed, ignoring the doctor who had come in and was groping for my pulse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said, quite gently. He took my hand again, though I tried to pull it away. \u201cThis\u2014Jamie. Who was he?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, ragged breath. The doctor had hold of my other hand, still trying to take my pulse, and I felt absurdly panicked, as though I were being held captive between them. I fought down the feeling, though, and tried to speak steadily.</p><p>\u201cJames Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser,\u201d I said, spacing the words, formally, the way Jamie had spoken them to me when he first told me his full name\u2014on the day of our wedding. The thought made another tear overflow, and I blotted it against my shoulder, my hands being restrained.</p><p>\u201cHe was a Highlander. He was k-killed at Culloden.\u201d It was no use, I was weeping again, the tears no anodyne to the grief that ripped through me, but the only response I had to unendurable pain. I bent forward slightly, trying to encapsulate it, wrapping myself around the tiny, imperceptible life in my belly, the only remnant left to me of Jamie Fraser.</p><p>Frank and the doctor exchanged a glance of which I was only half-conscious. Of course, to them, Culloden was part of the distant past. To me, it had happened only two days before.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should let Mrs. Randall rest for a bit,\u201d the doctor suggested. \u201cShe seems a wee bit upset just now.\u201d</p><p>Frank looked uncertainly from the doctor to me. \u201cWell, she certainly does seem upset. But I really want to find out...what\u2019s this, Claire?\u201d Stroking my hand, he had encountered the silver ring on my fourth finger, and now bent to examine it. It was the ring Jamie had given me for our marriage; a wide silver band in the Highland interlace pattern, the links engraved with tiny, stylized thistle blooms.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaimed, panicked, as Frank tried to twist it off my finger. I jerked my hand away and cradled it, fisted, beneath my bosom, cupped in my left hand, which still wore Frank\u2019s gold wedding band. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t take it, I won\u2019t let you! That\u2019s my wedding ring!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see here, Claire\u2014\u201d Frank\u2019s words were interrupted by the doctor, who had crossed to Frank\u2019s side of the bed, and was now bending down to murmur in his ear. I caught a few words\u2014\u201cnot trouble your wife just now. The shock\u201d\u2014and then Frank was on his feet once more, being firmly urged away by the doctor, who gave a nod to one of the nurses in passing.</p><p>I barely felt the sting of the hypodermic needle, too engulfed in the fresh wave of grief to take notice of anything. I dimly heard Frank\u2019s parting words, \u201cAll right\u2014but Claire, I will know!\u201d And then the blessed darkness came down, and I slept without dreaming, for a long, long time.</p><p>Roger tilted the decanter, bringing the level of the spirit in the glass up to the halfway point. He handed it to Claire with a half-smile.</p><p>\u201cFiona\u2019s grannie always said whisky is good for what ails ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse remedies.\u201d Claire took the glass and gave him back the half-smile in change.</p><p>Roger poured out a drink for himself, then sat down beside her, sipping quietly.</p><p>\u201cI tried to send him away, you know,\u201d she said suddenly, lowering her glass. \u201cFrank. I told him I knew he couldn\u2019t feel the same for me, no matter what he believed had happened. I said I would give him a divorce; he must go away and forget about me\u2014take up the life he\u2019d begun building without me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do it, though.\u201d Roger said. It was growing chilly in the study as the sun went down, and he bent and switched on the ancient electric fire. \u201cBecause you were pregnant?\u201d he guessed.</p><p>She shot him a sudden sharp look, then smiled, a little wryly.</p><p>\u201cYes, that was it. He said no one but a cad would dream of abandoning a pregnant woman with virtually no resources. Particularly one whose grip on reality seemed a trifle tenuous,\u201d she added ironically. \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite without resources\u2014I had a bit of money from my uncle Lamb\u2014but Frank wasn\u2019t a cad, either.\u201d Her glance shifted to the bookshelves. Her husband\u2019s historical works stood there, side by side, spines gleaming in the light of the desklamp.</p><p>\u201cHe was a very decent man,\u201d she said softly. She took another sip of her drink, closing her eyes as the alcoholic fumes rose up.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then\u2014he knew, or suspected, that he couldn\u2019t have children himself. Rather a blow, for a man so involved in history and genealogies. All those dynastic considerations, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can see that,\u201d Roger said slowly. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t he feel\u2014I mean, another man\u2019s child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have.\u201d The amber eyes were looking at him again, their clearness slightly softened by whisky and reminiscence. \u201cBut as it was, since he didn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014believe anything I said about Jamie, the baby\u2019s father was essentially unknown. If he didn\u2019t know who the man was\u2014and convinced himself that I didn\u2019t really know either, but had just made up these delusions out of traumatic shock\u2014well, then, there was no one ever to say that the child wasn\u2019t his. Certainly not me,\u201d she added, with just a tinge of bitterness.</p><p>She took a large swallow of whisky that made her eyes water slightly, and took a moment to wipe them.</p><p>\u201cBut to make sure, he took me clean away. To Boston,\u201d she went on. \u201cHe\u2019d been offered a good position at Harvard, and no one knew us there. That\u2019s where Brianna was born.\u201d</p> <p>The fretful crying jarred me awake yet again. I had gone back to bed at 6:30, after getting up five times during the night with the baby. A bleary-eyed look at the clock showed the time now as 7:00. A cheerful singing came from the bathroom, Frank\u2019s voice raised in \u201cRule, Britannia,\u201d over the noise of rushing water.</p><p>I lay in bed, heavy-limbed with exhaustion, wondering whether I had the strength to endure the crying until Frank got out of the shower and could bring Brianna to me. As though the baby knew what I was thinking, the crying rose two or three tones and escalated to a sort of periodic shriek, punctuated by frightening gulps for air. I flung back the covers and was on my feet, propelled by the same sort of panic with which I had greeted air raids during the War.</p><p>I lumbered down the chilly hall and into the nursery, to find Brianna, aged three months, lying on her back, yelling her small red head off. I was so groggy from lack of sleep that it took a moment for me to realize that I had left her on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cDarling! You turned over! All by yourself!\u201d Terrorized by her audacious act, Brianna waved her little pink fists and squalled louder, eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>I snatched her up, patting her back and murmuring to the top of her red-fuzzed head.</p><p>\u201cOh, you precious darling! What a clever girl you are!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that? What\u2019s happened?\u201d Frank emerged from the bathroom, toweling his head, a second towel wrapped about his loins. \u201cIs something the matter with Brianna?\u201d</p><p>He came toward us, looking worried. As the birth grew closer, we had both been edgy; Frank irritable and myself terrified, having no idea what might happen between us, with the appearance of Jamie Fraser\u2019s child. But when the nurse had taken Brianna from her bassinet and handed her to Frank, with the words \u201cHere\u2019s Daddy\u2019s little girl,\u201d his face had grown blank, and then\u2014looking down at the tiny face, perfect as a rosebud\u2014gone soft with wonder. Within a week, he had been hers, body and soul.</p><p>I turned to him, smiling. \u201cShe turned over! All by herself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d His scrubbed face beamed with delight. \u201cIsn\u2019t it early for her to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. Dr. Spock says she oughtn\u2019t to be able to do it for another month, at least!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what does Dr. Spock know? Come here, little beauty; give Daddy a kiss for being so precocious.\u201d He lifted the soft little body, encased in its snug pink sleep-suit, and kissed her button of a nose. Brianna sneezed, and we both laughed.</p><p>I stopped then, suddenly aware that it was the first time I had laughed in nearly a year. Still more, that it was the first time I had laughed with Frank.</p><p>He realized it too; his eyes met mine over the top of Brianna\u2019s head. They were a soft hazel, and at the moment, filled with tenderness. I smiled at him, a little tremulous, and suddenly very much aware that he was all but naked, with water droplets sliding down his lean shoulders and shining on the smooth brown skin of his chest.</p> <p>The smell of burning reached us simultaneously, jarring us from this scene of domestic bliss.</p><p>\u201cThe coffee!\u201d Thrusting Bree unceremoniously into my arms, Frank bolted for the kitchen, leaving both towels in a heap at my feet. Smiling at the sight of his bare bu**ocks, gleaming an incongruous white as he sprinted into the kitchen, I followed him more slowly, holding Bree against my shoulder.</p><p>He was standing at the sink, naked, amid a cloud of malodorous steam rising from the scorched coffeepot.</p><p>\u201cTea, maybe?\u201d I asked, adroitly anchoring Brianna on my hip with one arm while I rummaged in the cupboard. \u201cNone of the orange pekoe leaf left, I\u2019m afraid; just Lipton\u2019s teabags.\u201d</p><p>Frank made a face; an Englishman to the bone, he would rather lap water out of the toilet than drink tea made from teabags. The Lipton\u2019s had been left by Mrs. Grossman, the weekly cleaning woman, who thought tea made from loose leaves messy and disgusting.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll get a cup of coffee on my way to the university. Oh, speaking of which, you recall that we\u2019re having the Dean and his wife to dinner tonight? Mrs. Hinchcliffe is bringing a present for Brianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I said, without enthusiasm. I had met the Hinchcliffes before, and wasn\u2019t all that keen to repeat the experience. Still, the effort had to be made. With a mental sigh, I shifted the baby to the other side and groped in the drawer for a pencil to make a grocery list.</p><p>Brianna burrowed into the front of my red chenille dressing gown, making small voracious grunting noises.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be hungry again,\u201d I said to the top of her head. \u201cI fed you not two hours ago.\u201d My br**sts were beginning to leak in response to her rooting, though, and I was already sitting down and loosening the front of my gown.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hinchcliffe said that a baby shouldn\u2019t be fed every time it cries,\u201d Frank observed. \u201cThey get spoilt if they aren\u2019t kept to a schedule.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time I had heard Mrs. Hinchcliffe\u2019s opinions on child-rearing.</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll be spoilt, won\u2019t she?\u201d I said coldly, not looking at him. The small pink mouth clamped down fiercely, and Brianna began to suck with mindless appetite. I was aware that Mrs. Hinchcliffe also thought breast-feeding both vulgar and insanitary. I, who had seen any number of eighteenth-century babies nursing contentedly at their mothers\u2019 breasts, didn\u2019t.</p><p>Frank sighed, but didn\u2019t say anything further. After a moment, he put down the pot holder and sidled toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around six then, shall I? Ought I to bring home anything\u2014save you going out?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a brief smile, and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d He hesitated a moment, as I settled Bree more comfortably on my lap, head resting on the crook of my arm, the round of her head echoing the curve of my breast. I looked up from the baby, and found him watching me intently, eyes fixed on the swell of my half-exposed bosom.</p><p>My own eyes flicked downward over his body. I saw the beginnings of his arousal, and bent my head over the baby, to hide my flushing face.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d I muttered, to the top of her head.</p><p>He stood still a moment, then leaned forward and kissed me briefly on the cheek, the warmth of his bare body unsettlingly near.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Claire,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t come into the kitchen again before leaving, so I had a chance to finish feeding Brianna and bring my own feelings into some semblance of normality.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen Frank naked since my return; he had always dressed in bathroom or closet. Neither had he tried to kiss me before this morning\u2019s cautious peck. The pregnancy had been what the obstetrician called \u201chigh-risk,\u201d and there had been no question of Frank\u2019s sharing my bed, even had I been so disposed\u2014which I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I should have seen this coming, but I hadn\u2019t. Absorbed first in sheer misery, and then in the physical torpor of oncoming motherhood, I had pushed away all considerations beyond my bulging belly. After Brianna\u2019s birth, I had lived from feeding to feeding, seeking small moments of mindless peace, when I could hold her oblivious body close and find relief from thought and memory in the pure sensual pleasure of touching and holding her.</p><p>Frank, too, cuddled the baby and played with her, falling asleep in his big chair with her stretched out atop his lanky form, rosy cheek pressed flat against his chest, as they snored together in peaceful companionship. He and I did not touch each other, though, nor did we truly talk about anything beyond our basic domestic arrangements\u2014except Brianna.</p><p>The baby was our shared focus; a point through which we could at once reach each other, and keep each other at arm\u2019s length. It looked as though arm\u2019s length was no longer close enough for Frank.</p><p>I could do it\u2014physically, at least. I had seen the doctor for a checkup the week before, and he had\u2014with an avuncular wink and a pat on the bottom\u2014assured me that I could resume \u201crelations\u201d with my husband at any time.</p><p>I knew Frank hadn\u2019t been celibate since my disappearance. In his late forties, he was still lean and muscular, dark and sleek, a very handsome man. Women clustered about him at cocktail parties like bees round a honeypot, emitting small hums of sexual excitement.</p><p>There had been one girl with brown hair whom I had noticed particularly at the departmental party; she stood in the corner and stared at Frank mournfully over her drink. Later she became tearfully and incoherently drunk, and was escorted home by two female friends, who took turns casting evil looks at Frank and at me, standing by his side, silently bulging in my flowered maternity dress.</p><p>He\u2019d been discreet, though. He was always home at night, and took pains not to have lipstick on his collar. So, now he meant to come home all the way. I supposed he had some right to expect it; was that not a wifely duty, and I once more his wife?</p><p>There was only one small problem. It wasn\u2019t Frank I reached for, deep in the night, waking out of sleep. It wasn\u2019t his smooth, lithe body that walked my dreams and roused me, so that I came awake moist and gasping, my heart pounding from the half-remembered touch. But I would never touch that man again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I whispered, \u201cOh, Jamie.\u201d My tears sparkled in the morning light, adorning Brianna\u2019s soft red fuzz like scattered pearls and diamonds.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a good day. Brianna had a bad diaper rash, which made her cross and irritable, needing to be picked up every few minutes. She nursed and fussed alternately, pausing to spit up at intervals, making clammy wet patches on whatever I wore. I changed my blouse three times before eleven o\u2019clock.</p><p>The heavy nursing bra I wore chafed under the arms, and my ni**les felt cold and chapped. Midway through my laborious tidying-up of the house, there was a whooshing clank from under the floorboards, and the hot-air registers died with a feeble sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo, next week won\u2019t do,\u201d I said over the telephone to the furnace-repair shop. I looked at the window, where the cold February fog was threatening to seep under the sill and engulf us. \u201cIt\u2019s forty-two degrees in here, and I have a three-month-old baby!\u201d The baby in question was sitting in her baby seat, swaddled in all her blankets, squalling like a scalded cat. Ignoring the quacking of the person on the other end, I held the receiver next to Brianna\u2019s wide open mouth for several seconds.</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d I demanded, lifting the phone to my ear again.</p><p>\u201cAwright, lady,\u201d said a resigned voice on the other end of the line. \u201cI\u2019ll come out this afternoon, sometime between noon and six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon and six? Can\u2019t you narrow it down a little more than that? I have to get out to the market,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t the only dead furnace in town, lady,\u201d the voice said with finality, and hung up. I glanced at the clock; eleven-thirty. I\u2019d never be able to get the marketing done and get back in half an hour. Marketing with a small baby was more like a ninety-minute expedition into Darkest Borneo, requiring massive amounts of equipment and tremendous expenditures of energy.</p><p>Gritting my teeth, I called the expensive market that delivered, ordered the necessities for dinner, and picked up the baby, who was by now the shade of an eggplant, and markedly smelly.</p> <p>\u201cThat looks ouchy, darling. You\u2019ll feel much better if we get it off, won\u2019t you?\u201d I said, trying to talk soothingly as I wiped the brownish slime off Brianna\u2019s bright-red bottom. She arched her back, trying to escape the clammy washcloth, and shrieked some more. A layer of Vaseline and the tenth clean diaper of the day; the diaper service truck wasn\u2019t due \u2019til tomorrow, and the house reeked of ammonia.</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart, there, there.\u201d I hoisted her up on my shoulder, patting her, but the screeching went on and on. Not that I could blame her; her poor bottom was nearly raw. Ideally, she should be let to lie about on a towel with nothing on, but with no heat in the house, that wasn\u2019t feasible. She and I were both wearing sweaters and heavy winter coats, which made the frequent feedings even more of a nuisance than usual; excavating a breast could take several minutes, while the baby screamed.</p><p>Brianna couldn\u2019t sleep for more than ten minutes at a time. Consequently, neither could I. When we did drift off together at four o\u2019clock, we were roused within a quarter of an hour by the crashing arrival of the furnace man, who pounded on the door, not bothering to set down the large wrench he was holding.</p><p>Jiggling the baby against my shoulder with one hand, I began cooking the dinner with the other, to the accompaniment of screeches in my ear and the sounds of violence from the cellar below.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t promising nothin\u2019, lady, but you got heat for now.\u201d The furnace man appeared abruptly, wiping a smear of grease from his creased forehead. He leaned forward to inspect Brianna, who was lying more or less peacefully across my shoulder, loudly sucking her thumb.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that thumb taste, sweetie?\u201d he inquired. \u201cThey say you shouldn\u2019t oughta let \u2019em suck their thumbs, you know,\u201d he informed me, straightening up. \u201cGives \u2019em crooked teeth and they\u2019ll need braces.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I said through my own teeth. \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, the chicken lay in its pan, stuffed and basted, surrounded by crushed garlic, sprigs of rosemary, and curls of lemon peel. A quick squeeze of lemon juice over the buttery skin, and I could stick it in the oven and go get myself and Brianna dressed. The kitchen looked like the result of an incompetent burglary, with cupboards hanging open and cooking paraphernalia strewn on every horizontal surface. I banged shut a couple of cupboard doors, and then the kitchen door itself, trusting that that would keep Mrs. Hinchcliffe out, even if good manners wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Frank had brought a new pink dress for Brianna to wear. It was a beautiful thing, but I eyed the layers of lace around the neck dubiously. They looked not only scratchy, but delicate.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll give it a try,\u201d I told her. \u201cDaddy will like you to look pretty. Let\u2019s try not to spit up in it, hm?\u201d</p><p>Brianna responded by shutting her eyes, stiffening, and grunting as she extruded more slime.</p><p>\u201cOh, well done!\u201d I said, sincerely. It meant changing the crib sheet, but at least it wouldn\u2019t make the diaper rash worse. The mess attended to and a fresh diaper in place, I shook out the pink dress, and paused to carefully wipe the snot and drool from her face before popping the garment over her head. She blinked at me and gurgled enticingly, windmilling her fists.</p><p>I obligingly lowered my head and went \u201cPfffft!\u201d into her navel, which made her squirm and gurgle with joy. We did it a few more times, then began the painstaking job of getting into the pink dress.</p><p>Brianna didn\u2019t like it; she started to complain as I put it over her head, and as I crammed her chubby little arms into the puffed sleeves, put back her head and let out a piercing cry.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I demanded, startled. I knew all her cries by now and mostly, what she meant by them, but this was a new one, full of fright and pain. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, darling?\u201d</p><p>She was screaming furiously now, tears rolling down her face. I turned her frantically over and patted her back, thinking she might have had a sudden attack of colic, but she wasn\u2019t doubled up. She was struggling violently, though, and as I turned her back over to pick her up, I saw the long red line running up the tender inside of her waving arm. A pin had been left in the dress, and had scored her flesh as I forced the sleeve up her arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby! Oh, I\u2019m so sorry! Mummy\u2019s so sorry!\u201d Tears were running down my own face as I eased the stabbing pin free and removed it. I clutched her to my shoulder, patting and soothing, trying to calm my own feelings of panicked guilt. Of course I hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her, but she wouldn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cOh, darling,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s all right now. Yes, Mummy loves you, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t I thought to check for pins? For that matter, what sort of maniac would package a baby\u2019s clothes using straight pins? Torn between fury and distress, I eased Brianna into the dress, wiped her chin, and carried her into the bedroom, where I laid her on my twin bed while I hastily changed to a decent skirt and a fresh blouse.</p><p>The doorbell rang as I was pulling on my stockings. There was a hole in one heel, but no time to do anything about it now. I stuck my feet into the pinching alligator pumps, snatched up Brianna, and went to answer the door.</p><p>It was Frank, too laden with packages to use his key. One-handed, I took most of them from him and parked them on the hall table.</p><p>\u201cDinner all ready, dear? I\u2019ve brought a new tablecloth and napkins\u2014thought ours were a bit shabby. And the wine, of course.\u201d He lifted the bottle in his hand, smiling, then leaned forward to peer at me, and stopped smiling. He looked disapprovingly from my disheveled hair to my blouse, freshly stained with spit-up milk.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Claire,\u201d he said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you fix yourself up a bit? I mean, it\u2019s not as though you have anything else to do, at home all day\u2014couldn\u2019t you take a few minutes for a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, quite loudly. I pushed Brianna, who was wailing again with fretful exhaustion, into his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again, and took the wine bottle from his unresisting hand.</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d I shrieked, stamping my foot. I swung the bottle widely, and he dodged, but it was the doorjamb I struck, and purplish splatters of Beaujolais flew across the stoop, leaving glass shards glittering in the light from the entryway.</p><p>I flung the shattered bottle into the azaleas and ran coatless down the walk and into the freezing fog. At the foot of the walk, I passed the startled Hinchcliffes, who were arriving half an hour early, presumably in hopes of catching me in some domestic deficiency. I hoped they\u2019d enjoy their dinner.</p><p>I drove aimlessly through the fog, the car\u2019s heater blasting on my feet, until I began to get low on gas. I wasn\u2019t going home; not yet. An all-night cafe? Then I realized that it was Friday night, and getting on for twelve o\u2019clock. I had a place to go, after all. I turned back toward the suburb where we lived, and the Church of St. Finbar.</p><p>At this hour, the chapel was locked to prevent vandalism and burglary. For the late adorers, there was a push-button lock set just below the door handle. Five buttons, numbered one to five. By pushing three of them, in the proper combination, the latch could be sprung to allow lawful entry.</p><p>I moved quietly along the back of the chapel, to the logbook that sat at the feet of St. Finbar, to record my arrival.</p><p>\u201cSt. Finbar?\u201d Frank had said incredulously. \u201cThere isn\u2019t such a saint. There can\u2019t possibly be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d I said, with a trace of smugness. \u201cAn Irish bishop, from the twelfth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Irish,\u201d said Frank dismissively. \u201cThat explains it. But what I can\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, careful to be tactful, \u201cis, er, well...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy go in for this Perpetual Adoration business? You\u2019ve never been the least devout, no more than I have. And you don\u2019t go to Mass or anything; Father Beggs asks me every week where you are.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t really say, Frank. It\u2019s just something...I need to do.\u201d I looked at him, helpless to explain adequately. \u201cIt\u2019s...peaceful there,\u201d I said, finally.</p><p>He opened his mouth as though to speak further, then turned away, shaking his head.</p><p>It was peaceful. The car park at the church was deserted, save for the single car of the adorer on duty at this hour, gleaming an anonymous black under the arc lights. Inside, I signed my name to the log and walked forward, coughing tactfully to alert the eleven o\u2019clock adorer to my presence without the rudeness of direct speech. I knelt behind him, a heavyset man in a yellow windcheater. After a moment, he rose, genuflected before the altar, turned and walked to the door, nodding briefly as he passed me.</p><p>The door hissed shut and I was alone, save for the Sacrament displayed on the altar, in the great golden sunburst of the monstrance. There were two candles on the altar, big ones. Smooth and white, they burned steadily in the still air, without a flicker. I closed my eyes for a moment, just listening to the silence.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything that had happened during the day whirled through my mind in a disjointed welter of thoughts and feelings. Coatless, I was shaking with cold from the short walk through the parking lot, but slowly I grew warm again, and my clenched hands relaxed in my lap.</p><p>At last, as usually happened here, I ceased to think. Whether it was the stoppage of time in the presence of eternity, or only the overtaking of a bone-deep fatigue, I didn\u2019t know. But the guilt over Frank eased, the wrenching grief for Jamie lessened, and even the constant tug of motherhood upon my emotions receded to the level of background noise, no louder than the slow beating of my own heart, regular and comforting in the dark peace of the chapel.</p><p>\u201cO Lord,\u201d I whispered, \u201cI commend to your mercy the soul of your servant James.\u201d And mine, I added silently. And mine.</p><p>I sat there without moving, watching the flickering glow of the candle flames in the gold surface of the monstrance, until the soft footsteps of the next adorer came down the aisle behind me, ending in the heavy creak of genuflection. They came once each hour, day and night. The Blessed Sacrament was never left alone.</p> <p>I stayed for a few minutes more, then slid out of the pew, with my own nod toward the altar. As I walked toward the back of the chapel, I saw a figure in the back row, under the shadow of the statue of St. Anthony. It stirred as I approached, then the man rose to his feet and made his way to the aisle to meet me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I hissed.</p><p>Frank nodded toward the form of the new adorer, already kneeling in contemplation, and took my elbow to guide me out.</p><p>I waited until the chapel door had closed behind us before pulling away and whirling to confront him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I said angrily. \u201cWhy did you come after me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was worried about you.\u201d He gestured toward the empty car park, where his large Buick nestled protectively next to my small Ford. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, a lone woman walking about in the very late night in this part of town. I came to see you home. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mention the Hinchcliffes, or the dinner party. My annoyance ebbed a bit.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you do with Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsked old Mrs. Munsing from next door to keep an ear out in case she cried. But she seemed dead asleep; I didn\u2019t think there was much chance. Come along now, it\u2019s cold out.\u201d</p><p>It was; the freezing air off the bay was coiling in white tendrils around the posts of the arc lights, and I shivered in my thin blouse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at home, then,\u201d I said.</p> <p>The warmth of the nursery reached out to embrace me as I went in to check Brianna. She was still asleep, but restless, turning her russet head from side to side, the groping little mouth opening and closing like the breathing of a fish.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting hungry,\u201d I whispered to Frank, who had come in behind me and was hovering over my shoulder, peering fondly at the baby. \u201cI\u2019d better feed her before I come to bed; then she\u2019ll sleep later in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you a hot drink,\u201d and he vanished through the door to the kitchen as I picked up the sleepy, warm bundle.</p><p>She had only drained one side, but she was full. The slack mouth pulled slowly away from the nipple, rimmed with milk, and the fuzzy head fell heavily back on my arm. No amount of gentle shaking or calling would rouse her to nurse on the other side, so at last I gave up and tucked her back in her crib, patting her back softly until a faint, contented belch wafted up from the pillow, succeeded by the heavy breathing of absolute satiation.</p><p>\u201cDown for the night, is she?\u201d Frank drew the baby blanket, decorated with yellow bunnies, up over her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I sat back in my rocking chair, mentally and physically too exhausted to get up again. Frank came to stand behind me; his hand rested lightly on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead, then?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>I told you so, I started to say. Then I stopped, closed my mouth and only nodded, rocking slowly, staring at the dark crib and its tiny occupant.</p> <p>My right breast was still painfully swollen with milk. No matter how tired I was, I couldn\u2019t sleep until I took care of it. With a sigh of resignation, I reached for the breast pump, an ungainly and ridiculous-looking rubber contraption. Using it was undignified and uncomfortable, but better than waking up in an hour in bursting pain, sopping wet from overflowing milk.</p><p>I waved a hand at Frank, dismissing him.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. It will only take a few minutes, but I have to...\u201d</p><p>Instead of leaving or answering, he took the pump from my hand and laid it down on the table. As though it moved of its own will, without direction from him, his hand rose slowly through the warm, dark air of the nursery and cupped itself gently around the swollen curve of my breast.</p><p>His head bowed and his lips fastened softly on my nipple. I groaned, feeling the half-painful prickle of the milk rushing through the tiny ducts. I put a hand behind his head, and pressed him slightly closer.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d I whispered. His mouth was soft, gentle in its pressure, nothing like the relentless grasp of a baby\u2019s hard, toothless gums, that fasten on like grim death, demanding and draining, releasing the bounteous fountain at once in response to their greed.</p><p>Frank knelt before me, his mouth a supplicant. Was this how God felt, I wondered, seeing the adorers before Him\u2014was He, too, filled with tenderness and pity? The haze of fatigue made me feel as though everything happened in slow motion, as though we were under water. Frank\u2019s hands moved slowly as sea fronds, swaying in the current, moving over my flesh with a touch as gentle as the brush of kelp leaves, lifting me with the strength of a wave, and laying me down on the shore of the nursery rug. I closed my eyes, and let the tide carry me away.</p><p>The front door of the old manse opened with a screech of rusty hinges, announcing the return of Brianna Randall. Roger was on his feet and into the hall at once, drawn by the sound of girls\u2019 voices.</p><p>\u201cA pound of best butter\u2014that\u2019s what you told me to ask for, and I did, but I kept wondering whether there was such a thing as second-best butter, or worst butter\u2014\u201d Brianna was handing over wrapped packages to Fiona, laughing and talking at once.</p><p>\u201cWell, and if ye got it from that auld rascal Wicklow, worst is what it\u2019s likely to be, no matter what he says,\u201d Fiona interrupted. \u201cOh, and ye\u2019ve got the cinnamon, that\u2019s grand! I\u2019ll make cinnamon scones, then; d\u2019ye want to come and watch me do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but first I want supper. I\u2019m starved!\u201d Brianna stood on tiptoe, sniffing hopefully in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cWhat are we having\u2014haggis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaggis! Gracious, ye silly Sassenach\u2014ye dinna have haggis in the spring! Ye have it in the autumn when the sheep are killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I a Sassenach?\u201d Brianna seemed delighted at the name.</p><p>\u201cOf course ye are, gowk. But I like ye fine, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Fiona laughed up at Brianna, who towered over the small Scottish girl by nearly a foot. Fiona was nineteen, prettily charming and slightly plump; next to her, Brianna looked like a medieval carving, strong-boned and severe. With her long, straight nose and the long hair glowing red-gold beneath the glass bowl of the ceiling fixture, she might have walked out of an illuminated manuscript, vivid enough to endure a thousand years unchanged.</p><p>Roger was suddenly conscious of Claire Randall, standing near his elbow. She was looking at her daughter, with an expression in which love, pride, and something else were mingled\u2014memory, perhaps? He realized, with a slight shock, that Jamie Fraser too must have had not only the striking height and Viking red hair he had bequeathed to his daughter, but likely the same sheer physical presence.</p><p>It was quite remarkable, he thought. She didn\u2019t do or say anything so out of the ordinary, and yet Brianna undeniably drew people. There was some attraction about her, almost magnetic, that drew everyone near into the glow of her orbit.</p><p>It drew him; Brianna turned and smiled at him, and without consciousness of having moved, he found himself near enough to see the faint freckles high on her cheekbones, and smell the whiff of pipe tobacco that lingered in her hair from her expeditions to the shops.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cAny luck with the Clans office, or have you been too busy playing dogsbody for Fiona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDogsbody?\u201d Brianna\u2019s eyes slanted into blue triangles of amusement. \u201cDogsbody? First I\u2019m a Sassenach, and now I\u2019m a dogsbody. What do you Scots call people when you\u2019re trying to be nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarrrrlin\u2019,\u201d he said, rolling his r\u2019s exaggeratedly, and making both girls laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou sound like an Aberdeen terrier in a bad mood,\u201d Claire observed. \u201cDid you find anything at the Highland Clans library, Bree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of stuff,\u201d Brianna replied, rummaging through the stack of photocopies she had set down on the hall table. \u201cI managed to read most of it while they were making the copies\u2014this one was the most interesting.\u201d She pulled a sheet from the stack and handed it to Roger.</p><p>It was an extract from a book of Highland legends; an entry headed \u201cLeap O\u2019 the Cask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegends?\u201d said Claire, peering over his shoulder. \u201cIs that what we want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d Roger was perusing the sheet, and spoke absently, his attention divided. \u201cSo far as the Scottish Highlands go, most of the history is oral, up to the mid-nineteenth century or so. That means there wasn\u2019t a great distinction made between stories about real people, stories of historical figures, and the stories about mythical things like water horses and ghosts and the doings of the Auld Folk. Scholars who wrote the stories down often didn\u2019t know for sure which they were dealing with, either\u2014sometimes it was a combination of fact and myth, and sometimes you could tell that it was a real historical occurrence being described.</p><p>\u201cThis one, for instance\u201d\u2014he passed the paper to Claire-\u201csounds like a real one. It\u2019s describing the story behind the name of a particular rock formation in the Highlands.\u201d</p><p>Claire brushed the hair behind her ear and bent her head to read, squinting in the dim light of the ceiling fixture. Fiona, too accustomed to musty papers and boring bits of history to be interested, disappeared back into her kitchen to see to the dinner.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Leap O\u2019 the Cask,\u2019\u201d Claire read. \u201c\u2018This unusual formation, located some distance above a burn, is named after the story of a Jacobite laird and his servant. The laird, one of the few fortunates to escape the disaster of Culloden, made his way with difficulty to his home, but was compelled to lie hidden in a cave on his lands for nearly seven years, while the English hunted the Highlands for the fugitive supporters of Charles Stuart. The laird\u2019s tenants loyally kept his presence a secret, and brought food and supplies to the laird in his hiding place. They were careful always to refer to the hidden man only as the \u201cDunbonnet,\u201d in order to avoid any chance of giving him away to the English patrols who frequently crossed the district.</p><p>\u201c\u2018One day, a boy bringing a cask of ale up the trail to the laird\u2019s cave met a group of English dragoons. Bravely refusing either to answer the soldiers\u2019 questions, or to give up his burden, the boy was attacked by one of the dragoons, and dropped the cask, which bounded down the steep hill, and into the burn below.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up from the paper, raising her eyebrows at her daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhy this one? We know\u2014or we think we know,\u201d she corrected, with a wry nod toward Roger, \u201cthat Jamie escaped from Culloden, but so did a lot of other people. What makes you think this laird might have been Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the Dunbonnet bit, of course,\u201d Brianna answered, as though surprised that she should ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Roger looked at her, puzzled. \u201cWhat about the Dunbonnet?\u201d</p> <p>In answer, Brianna picked up a hank of her thick red hair and waggled it under his nose.</p><p>\u201cDunbonnet!\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cA dull brown bonnet, right? He wore a hat all the time, because he had hair that could be recognized! Didn\u2019t you say the English called him \u2018Red Jamie\u2019? They knew he had red hair\u2014he had to hide it!\u201d</p><p>Roger stared at her, speechless. The hair floated loose on her shoulders, alive with fiery light.</p><p>\u201cYou could be right,\u201d Claire said. Excitement made her eyes bright as she looked at her daughter. \u201cIt was like yours\u2014Jamie\u2019s hair was just like yours, Bree.\u201d She reached up and softly stroked Brianna\u2019s hair. The girl\u2019s face softened as she looked down at her mother.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking about that while I was reading\u2014trying to see him, you know?\u201d She stopped and cleared her throat, as though something might be caught in it. \u201cI could see him, out in the heather, hiding, and the sun shining off his hair. You said he\u2019d been an outlaw; I just\u2014I just thought he must have known pretty well...how to hide. If people were trying to kill him,\u201d she finished softly.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Roger spoke briskly, to dispel the shadow in Brianna\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a marvelous job of guesswork, but maybe we can tell for sure, with a little more work. If we can find Leap O\u2019 the Cask on a map\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of dummy do you think I am?\u201d Brianna said scornfully. \u201cI thought of that.\u201d The shadow disappeared, replaced by an expression of smugness. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so late; I made the clerk drag out every map of the Highlands they had.\u201d She withdrew another photocopied sheet from the stack and poked a finger triumphantly near the upper edge.</p><p>\u201cSee? It\u2019s so tiny, it doesn\u2019t show up on most maps, but this one had it. Right there; there\u2019s the village of Broch Mordha, which Mama says is near the Lallybroch estate, and there\u201d\u2014her finger moved a quarter-inch, pointing to a line of microscopic print. \u201cSee?\u201d she repeated. \u201cHe went back to his estate\u2014Lallybroch\u2014and that\u2019s where he hid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot having a magnifying glass to hand, I\u2019ll take your word for it that that says \u2018Leap O\u2019 the Cask,\u2019\u201d Roger said, straightening up. He grinned at Brianna. \u201cCongratulations, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve found him\u2014that far, at least.\u201d</p><p>Brianna smiled, her eyes suspiciously bright. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly. She touched the two sheets of paper with a gentle finger. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>Claire squeezed her daughter\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you have your father\u2019s hair, it\u2019s nice to see you have your mother\u2019s brains,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cLet\u2019s go and celebrate your discovery with Fiona\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Roger said to Brianna, as they followed Claire toward the dining room. His hand rested lightly on her waist. \u201cYou should be proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, with a brief smile, but the pensive expression returned almost at once to the curve of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Roger asked softly, stopping in the hall. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d She turned to face him, a small line visible between the ruddy brows. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014I was just thinking, trying to imagine\u2014what do you think it was like for him? Living in a cave for seven years? And what happened to him then?\u201d</p><p>Moved by an impulse, Roger leaned forward and kissed her lightly between the brows.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, darlin\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut maybe we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>Lallybroch</p> <p>4</p><p>THE DUNBONNET</p><p>Lallybroch</p><p>November 1752</p><p>He came down to the house once a month to shave, when one of the boys brought him word it was safe. Always at night, moving soft-footed as a fox through the dark. It seemed necessary, somehow, a small gesture toward the concept of civilization.</p><p>He would slip like a shadow through the kitchen door, to be met with Ian\u2019s smile or his sister\u2019s kiss, and would feel the transformation begin. The basin of hot water, the freshly stropped razor would be laid ready for him on the table, with whatever there was for shaving soap. Now and then it was real soap, if Cousin Jared had sent some from France; more often just half-rendered tallow, eye-stinging with lye.</p><p>He could feel the change begin with the first scent of the kitchen\u2014so strong and rich, after the wind-thin smells of loch and moor and wood\u2014but it wasn\u2019t until he had finished the ritual of shaving that he felt himself altogether human once more.</p><p>They had learned not to expect him to talk until he had shaved; words came hard after a month\u2019s solitude. Not that he could think of nothing to say; it was more that the words inside formed a logjam in his throat, battling each other to get out in the short time he had. He needed those few minutes of careful grooming to pick and choose, what he would say first and to whom.</p><p>There was news to hear and to ask about\u2014of English patrols in the district, of politics, of arrests and trials in London and Edinburgh. That he could wait for. Better to talk to Ian about the estate, to Jenny about the children. If it seemed safe, the children would be brought down to say hello to their uncle, to give him sleepy hugs and damp kisses before stumbling back to their beds.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be getting a man soon\u201d had been his first choice of conversation when he came in September, with a nod toward Jenny\u2019s eldest child, his namesake. The ten-year-old sat at the table with a certain constraint, immensely conscious of the dignity of his temporary position as man of the house.</p><p>\u201cAye, all I need\u2019s another of the creatures to worry over,\u201d his sister replied tartly, but she touched her son\u2019s shoulder in passing, with a pride that belied her words.</p><p>\u201cHave ye word from Ian, then?\u201d His brother-in-law had been arrested\u2014for the fourth time\u2014three weeks before, and taken to Inverness under suspicion of being a Jacobite sympathizer.</p><p>Jenny shook her head, bringing a covered dish to set before him. The thick warm smell of partridge pie drifted up from the pricked crust, and made his mouth water so heavily, he had to swallow before he could speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s naught to fret for,\u201d Jenny said, spooning out the pie onto his plate. Her voice was calm, but the small vertical line between her brows deepened. \u201cI\u2019ve sent Fergus to show them the deed of sasine, and Ian\u2019s discharge from his regiment. They\u2019ll send him home again, so soon as they realize he isna the laird of Lallybroch, and there\u2019s naught to be gained by deviling him.\u201d With a glance at her son, she reached for the ale jug. \u201cPrecious chance they have of provin\u2019 a wee bairn to be a traitor.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was grim, but held a note of satisfaction at the thought of the English court\u2019s confusion. The rain-spattered deed of sasine that proved transfer of the title of Lallybroch from the elder James to the younger had made its appearance in court before, each time foiling the Crown\u2019s attempt to seize the estate as the property of a Jacobite traitor.</p><p>He would feel it begin to slip away when he left\u2014that thin veneer of humanity\u2014more of it gone with each step away from the farmhouse. Sometimes he would keep the illusion of warmth and family all the way to the cave where he hid; other times it would disappear almost at once, torn away by a chill wind, rank and acrid with the scent of burning.</p><p>The English had burned three crofts, beyond the high field. Pulled Hugh Kirby and Geoff Murray from their firesides and shot them by their own doorsteps, with no question or word of formal accusation. Young Joe Fraser had escaped, warned by his wife, who had seen the English coming, and had lived three weeks with Jamie in the cave, until the soldiers were well away from the district\u2014and Ian with them.</p><p>In October, it had been the older lads he spoke to; Fergus, the French boy he had taken from a Paris brothel, and Rabbie MacNab, the kitchenmaid\u2019s son, Fergus\u2019s best friend.</p><p>He had drawn the razor slowly down one cheek and round the angle of his jaw, then wiped the lathered blade against the edge of the basin. From the corner of one eye, he caught a faint glimpse of fascinated envy on the face of Rabbie MacNab. Turning slightly, he saw that the three boys\u2014Rabbie, Fergus, and Young Jamie\u2014were all watching him intently, mouths slightly open.</p><p>\u201cHave ye no seen a man shave before?\u201d he asked, cocking one brow.</p><p>Rabbie and Fergus glanced at each other, but left it to Young Jamie, as titular owner of the estate, to answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, well...aye, Uncle,\u201d he said, blushing. \u201cBut...I m-mean\u201d\u2014he stammered slightly and blushed even harder\u2014\u201cwith my Da gone, and even when he\u2019s home, we dinna see him shave himself always, and well, you\u2019ve just such a lot of hair on your face, Uncle, after a whole month, and it\u2019s only we\u2019re so glad to see you again, and...\u201d</p><p>It dawned on Jamie quite suddenly that to the boys he must seem a most romantic figure. Living alone in a cave, emerging at dark to hunt, coming down out of the mist in the night, filthy and wild-haired, beard all in a fierce red sprout\u2014yes, at their age, it likely seemed a glamorous adventure to be an outlaw and live hidden in the heather, in a dank, cramped cave. At fifteen and sixteen and ten, they had no notion of guilt or bitter loneliness, of the weight of a responsibility that could not be relieved by action.</p><p>They might understand fear, of a sort. Fear of capture, fear of death. Not the fear of solitude, of his own nature, fear of madness. Not the constant, chronic fear of what his presence might do to them\u2014if they thought about that risk at all, they dismissed it, with the casual assumption of immortality that was the right of boys.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he had said, turning casually back to the looking glass as Young Jamie stuttered to a halt. \u201cMan is born to sorrow and whiskers. One of the plagues of Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf Adam?\u201d Fergus looked openly puzzled, while the others tried to pretend they had the slightest idea what Jamie was talking about. Fergus, as a Frenchie, was not expected to know everything.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Jamie pulled his upper lip down over his teeth and scraped delicately beneath his nose. \u201cIn the beginning, when God made man, Adam\u2019s chin was as hairless as Eve\u2019s. And their bodies both smooth as a newborn child\u2019s,\u201d he added, seeing Young Jamie\u2019s eyes dart toward Rabbie\u2019s crotch. Beardless Rabbie still was, but the faint dark down on his upper lip bespoke new sproutings elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cBut when the angel wi\u2019 the flaming sword drove them out of Eden, no sooner had they passed the gate of the garden, when the hair began to sprout and itch on Adam\u2019s chin, and ever since, man has been cursed with shaving.\u201d He finished his own chin with a final flourish, and bowed theatrically to his audience. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what about the other hair?\u201d Rabbie demanded. \u201cYe dinna shave there!\u201d Young Jamie giggled at the thought, going red again.</p><p>\u201cAnd a damn good thing, too,\u201d his elder namesake observed. \u201cYe\u2019d need the devil of a steady hand. No need of a looking glass, though,\u201d he added, to a chorus of giggles.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the ladies?\u201d Fergus said. His voice broke on the word \u201cladies,\u201d in a bullfrog croak that made the other two laugh harder. \u201cCertainly les filles have hair there, too, but they do not shave it\u2014usually not, anyway,\u201d he added, clearly thinking of some of the sights of his early life in the brothel.</p><p>Jamie heard his sister\u2019s footsteps coming down the hall.</p> <p>\u201cOh, well, that\u2019s no a curse,\u201d he told his rapt audience, picking up the basin and tossing the contents neatly through the open window. \u201cGod gave that as a consolation to man. If ye\u2019ve ever the privilege of seeing a woman in her skin, gentlemen,\u201d he said, looking over his shoulder toward the door and lowering his voice confidentially, \u201cye\u2019ll observe that the hair there grows in the shape of an arrow\u2014pointing the way, ye ken, so as a poor ignorant man can find his way safe home.\u201d</p><p>He turned grandly away from the guffawing and sniggers behind him, to be struck suddenly with shame as he saw his sister, coming down the hall with the slow, waddling stride of advanced pregnancy. She was holding the tray with his supper on top of her swelling stomach. How could he have demeaned her so, for a crude jest and the sake of a moment\u2019s camaraderie with the boys?</p><p>\u201cBe still!\u201d he had snapped at the boys, who stopped giggling abruptly and stared at him in puzzlement. He hastened forward to take the tray from Jenny and set it on the table.</p><p>It was a savoury made of goat\u2019s meat and bacon, and he saw Fergus\u2019s prominent Adam\u2019s apple bob in the slender throat at the smell of it. He knew they saved the best of the food for him; it didn\u2019t take much looking at the pinched faces across the table. When he came, he brought what meat he could, snared rabbits or grouse, sometimes a nest of plover\u2019s eggs\u2014but it was never enough, for a house where hospitality must stretch to cover the needs of not only family and servants, but the families of the murdered Kirby and Murray. At least until spring, the widows and children of his tenants must bide here, and he must do his best to feed them.</p><p>\u201cSit down by me,\u201d he said to Jenny, taking her arm and gently guiding her to a seat on the bench beside him. She looked surprised\u2014it was her habit to wait on him when he came\u2014but sat down gladly enough. It was late, and she was tired; he could see the dark smudges beneath her eyes.</p> <p>With great firmness, he cut a large slab of the savoury and set the plate before her.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s all for you!\u201d Jenny protested. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d he said. \u201cYe need more\u2014for the babe,\u201d he added, with inspiration. If she would not eat for herself, she would for the child. She hesitated a moment longer, but then smiled at him, picked up her spoon, and began to eat.</p><p>Now it was November, and the chill struck through the thin shirt and breeches he wore. He hardly noticed, intent on his tracking. It was cloudy, but with a thin-layered mackerel sky, through which the full moon shed plenty of light.</p><p>Thank God it wasn\u2019t raining; impossible to hear through the pattering of raindrops, and the pungent scent of wet plants masked the smell of animals. His nose had grown almost painfully acute through the long months of living outdoors; the smells of the house sometimes nearly knocked him down when he stepped inside.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t quite close enough to smell the musky scent of the stag, but he heard the telltale rustle of its brief start when it scented him. Now it would be frozen, one of the shadows that rippled across the hillside around him, under the racing clouds.</p> <p>He turned as slowly as he possibly could toward the spot where his ears had told him the stag stood. His bow was in his hand, an arrow ready to the string. He would have one shot\u2014maybe\u2014when the stag bolted.</p><p>Yes, there! His heart sprang into his throat as he saw the antlers, pricking sharp and black above the surrounding gorse. He steadied himself, took a deep breath, and then the one step forward.</p><p>The crash of a deer\u2019s flight was always startlingly loud, to frighten back a stalker. This stalker was prepared, though. He neither startled nor pursued, but stood his ground, sighting along the shaft of the arrow, following with his eye the track of the springing deer, judging the moment, holding fire, and then the bowstring slapped his wrist with stinging force.</p><p>It was a clean shot, just behind the shoulder, and a good thing, too; he doubted he had the strength to run down a full-grown stag. It had fallen in a clear spot behind a clump of gorse, legs stuck out, stiff as sticks, in the oddly helpless way of dying ungulates. The hunter\u2019s moon lit its glazing eye, so the soft dark stare was hidden, the mystery of its dying shielded by blank silver.</p><p>He pulled the dirk from his belt and knelt by the deer, hastily saying the words of the gralloch prayer. Old John Murray, Ian\u2019s father, had taught him. His own father\u2019s mouth had twisted slightly, hearing it, from which he gathered that this prayer was perhaps not addressed to the same God they spoke to in church on Sunday. But his father had said nothing, and he had mumbled the words himself, scarcely noticing what he said, in the nervous excitement of feeling old John\u2019s hand, steady on his own, for the first time pressing down the knife blade into hairy hide and steaming flesh.</p><p>Now, with the sureness of practice, he thrust up the sticky muzzle in one hand, and with the other, slit the deer\u2019s throat.</p><p>The blood spurted hot over knife and hand, pumping two or three times, the jet dying away to a steady stream as the carcass drained, the great vessels of the throat cut through. Had he paused to think, he might not have done it, but hunger and dizziness and the cold fresh intoxication of the night had taken him far past the point of thinking. He cupped his hands beneath the running stream and brought them steaming to his mouth.</p><p>The moon shone black on his cupped, spilling hands, and it was as though he absorbed the deer\u2019s substance, rather than drank it. The taste of the blood was salt and silver, and the heat of it was his own. There was no startlement of hot or cold as he swallowed, only the taste of it, rich in his mouth, and the head-swimming, hot-metal smell, and the sudden clench and rumble of his belly at the nearness of food.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and breathed, and the cold damp air came back, between the hot reek of the carcass and his senses. He swallowed once, then wiped the back of his hand across his face, cleaned his hands on the grass, and set about the business at hand.</p><p>There was the sudden effort of moving the limp, heavy carcass, and then the gralloch, the long stroke of mingled strength and delicacy that slit the hide between the legs, but did not penetrate the sac that held the entrails. He forced his hands into the carcass, a hot wet intimacy, and again there was an effortful tug that brought out the sac, slick and moon-shining in his hands. A slash above and another below, and the mass slid free, the transformation of black magic that changed a deer to meat.</p><p>It was a small stag, although it had points to its antlers. With luck, he could carry it alone, rather than leave it to the mercy of foxes and badgers until he could bring help to move it. He ducked a shoulder under one leg, and slowly rose, grunting with effort as he shifted the burden to a solid resting place across his back.</p><p>The moon cast his shadow on a rock, humped and fantastic, as he made his slow, ungainly way down the hill. The deer\u2019s antlers bobbed above his shoulder, giving him in shadowed profile the semblance of a horned man. He shivered slightly at the thought, remembering tales of witches\u2019 sabbats, where the Horned One came, to drink the sacrifice of goat\u2019s or rooster\u2019s blood.</p><p>He felt a little queasy, and more than a little light-headed. More and more, he felt the disorientation, the fragmenting of himself between day and night. By day, he was a creature of the mind alone, as he escaped his damp immobility by a stubborn, disciplined retreat into the avenues of thought and meditation, seeking refuge in the pages of books. But with the rising of the moon, all sense fled, succumbing at once to sensation, as he emerged into the fresh air like a beast from its lair, to run the dark hills beneath the stars, and hunt, driven by hunger, drunk with blood and moonlight.</p><p>He stared at the ground as he walked, night-sight keen enough to keep his footing, despite the heavy burden. The deer was limp and cooling, its stiff, soft hair scratching against the back of his neck, and his own sweat cooling in the breeze, as though he shared his prey\u2019s fate.</p><p>It was only as the lights of Lallybroch manor came into view that he felt at last the mantle of humanity fall upon him, and mind and body joined as one again as he prepared himself to greet his family.</p><p>5</p><p>TO US A CHILD IS GIVEN</p><p>Three weeks later, there was still no word of Ian\u2019s return. No word of any kind, in fact. Fergus had not come to the cave in several days, leaving Jamie in a fret of worry over how things might be at the house. If nothing else, the deer he had shot would have gone long since, with all the extra mouths to feed, and there would be precious little from the kailyard at this time of year.</p><p>He was sufficiently worried to risk an early visit, checking his snares and coming down from the hills just before sunset. Just in case, he was careful to pull on the woolen bonnet, knitted of rough dun yarn, that would hide his hair from any telltale fingering of late sunbeams. His size alone might provoke suspicion, but not certainty, and he had full confidence in the strength of his legs to carry him out of harm\u2019s way should he have the ill luck to meet with an English patrol. Hares in the heather were little match for Jamie Fraser, given warning.</p><p>The house was strangely quiet as he approached. There was none of the usual racket made by children: Jenny\u2019s five, and the six bairns belonging to the tenants, to say nothing of Fergus and Rabbie MacNab, who were a long way from being too old to chase each other round the stables, screeching like fiends.</p><p>The house felt strangely empty round him, as he paused just inside the kitchen door. He was standing in the back hall, the pantry to one side, the scullery to the other, and the main kitchen just beyond. He stood stock-still, reaching out with all his senses, listening as he inhaled the overpowering smells of the house. No, there was someone here; the faint sound of a scrape, followed by a soft, regular clinking came from behind the cloth-padded door that kept the heat of the kitchen from seeping out into the chilly back pantry.</p><p>It was a reassuringly domestic sound, so he pushed open the door cautiously, but without undue fear. His sister, Jenny, alone and vastly pregnant, was standing at the table, stirring something in a yellow bowl.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here? Where\u2019s Mrs. Coker?\u201d</p><p>His sister dropped the spoon with a startled shriek.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d Pale-faced, she pressed a hand to her breast and closed her eyes. \u201cChrist! Ye scairt the bowels out of me.\u201d She opened her eyes, dark blue like his own, and fixed him with a penetrating stare. \u201cAnd what in the name of the Holy Mother are ye doing here now? I wasna expecting ye for a week at least.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFergus hasna come up the hill lately; I got worried,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re a sweet man, Jamie.\u201d The color was coming back into her face. She smiled at her brother and came close to hug him. It was an awkward business, with the impending baby in the way, but pleasant, nonetheless. He rested his cheek for a moment on the sleek darkness of her head, breathing in her complex aroma of candle wax and cinnamon, tallow-soap and wool. There was an unusual element to her scent this evening; he thought she was beginning to smell of milk.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he asked, releasing her reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mrs. Coker\u2019s dead,\u201d she answered, the faint crease between her brows deepening.</p> <p>\u201cAye?\u201d he said softly, and crossed himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for it.\u201d Mrs. Coker had been first housemaid and then housekeeper for the family, since the marriage of his own parents, forty-odd years before. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday forenoon. \u2019Twasn\u2019t unexpected, poor soul, and it was peaceful. She died in her own bed, like she wanted, and Father McMurtry prayin\u2019 over her.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced reflexively toward the door that led to the servants\u2019 rooms, off the kitchen. \u201cIs she still here?\u201d</p><p>His sister shook her head. \u201cNo. I told her son they should have the wake here at the house, but the Cokers thought, everything being like it is\u201d\u2014her small moue encompassed Ian\u2019s absence, lurking Redcoats, refugee tenants, the dearth of food, and his own inconvenient presence in the cave\u2014\u201cthey thought better to have it at Broch Mordha, at her sister\u2019s place. So that\u2019s where everyone\u2019s gone. I told them I didna feel well enough to go,\u201d she added, then smiled, raising an impish brow. \u201cBut it was really that I wanted a few hours\u2019 peace and quiet, wi\u2019 the lot of them gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I\u2019ve come, breakin\u2019 in on your peace,\u201d Jamie said ruefully. \u201cShall I go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, clot-heid,\u201d his sister said affably. \u201cSit ye down, and I\u2019ll get on wi\u2019 the supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s to eat, then?\u201d he asked, sniffing hopefully.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what ye\u2019ve brought,\u201d his sister replied. She moved heavily about the kitchen, taking things from cupboard and hutch, pausing to stir the large kettle hung over the fire, from which a thin steam was rising.</p><p>\u201cIf ye\u2019ve brought meat, we\u2019ll have it. If not, it\u2019s brose and hough.\u201d</p><p>He made a face at this; the thought of boiled barley and shin-beef, the last remnants of the salted beef carcass they\u2019d bought two months before, was unappealing.</p><p>\u201cJust as well I had luck, then,\u201d he said. He upended his game bag and let the three rabbits fall onto the table in a limp tumble of gray fur and crumpled ears. \u201cAnd blackthorn berries,\u201d he added, tipping out the contents of the dun bonnet, now stained inside with the rich red juice.</p> <p>Jenny\u2019s eyes brightened at the sight. \u201cHare pie,\u201d she declared. \u201cThere\u2019s no currants, but the berries will do even better, and there\u2019s enough butter, thank God.\u201d Catching a tiny blink of movement among the gray fur, she slapped her hand down on the table, neatly obliterating the minuscule intruder.</p><p>\u201cTake them out and skin \u2019em, Jamie, or the kitchen will be hopping wi\u2019 fleas.\u201d</p><p>Returning with the skinned carcasses, he found the piecrust well advanced, and Jenny with smears of flour on her dress.</p><p>\u201cCut them into collops and break the bones for me, will ye, Jamie?\u201d she said, frowning at Mrs. McClintock\u2019s Receipts for Cookery and Pastry-Work, laid open on the table beside the pie pan.</p><p>\u201cSurely ye can make hare pie without looking in the wee book?\u201d he said, obligingly taking the big bone-crushing wooden mallet from the top of the hutch where it was kept. He grimaced as he took it into his hand, feeling the weight of it. It was very like the one that had broken his right hand several years before, in an English prison, and he had a sudden vivid memory of the shattered bones in a hare pie, splintered and cracked, leaking salty blood and marrow-sweetness into the meat.</p><p>\u201cAye, I can,\u201d his sister answered abstractedly, thumbing through the pages. \u201cIt\u2019s only that when ye havena got half the things ye need to make a dish, sometimes there\u2019s something else you\u2019ll come across in here, that ye can use instead.\u201d She frowned at the page before her. \u201cOrdinarily, I\u2019d use claret in the sauce, but we\u2019ve none in the house, save one of Jared\u2019s casks in the priest hole, and I dinna want to broach that yet\u2014we might need it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need telling what she might use it for. A cask of claret might grease the skids for Ian\u2019s release\u2014or at least pay for news of his welfare. He stole a sidewise glance at the great round of Jenny\u2019s belly. It wasn\u2019t for a man to say, but to his not inexperienced eyes, she looked damn near her time. Absently, he reached over the kettle and swished the blade of his dirk to and fro in the scalding liquid, then pulled it out and wiped it clean.</p><p>\u201cWhyever did ye do that, Jamie?\u201d He turned to find Jenny staring at him. The black curls were coming undone from their ribbon, and it gave him a pang to see the glimmer of a single white hair among the ebony.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, too obviously offhand as he picked up one carcass, \u201cClaire\u2014she told me ye ought to wash off a blade in boiling water before ye touched food with it.\u201d</p><p>He felt rather than saw Jenny\u2019s eyebrows rise. She had asked him about Claire only once, when he had come home from Culloden, half-conscious and mostly dead with fever.</p><p>\u201cShe is gone,\u201d he had said, and turned his face away. \u201cDinna speak her name to me again.\u201d Loyal as always, Jenny had not, and neither had he. He could not have said what made him say it today; unless perhaps it was the dreams.</p><p>He had them often, in varying forms, and it always unsettled him the day after, as though for a moment Claire had really been near enough to touch, and then had drawn away again. He could swear that sometimes he woke with the smell of her on him, musky and rich, pricked with the sharp, fresh scents of leaves and green herbs. He had spilled his seed in his sleep more than once while dreaming, an occurrence that left him faintly shamed and uneasy in mind. To distract both of them, he nodded at Jenny\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cHow close is it?\u201d he asked, frowning at her swollen midsection. \u201cYe look like a puffball mushroom\u2014one touch, and poof!\u201d He flicked his fingers wide in illustration.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Well, and I could wish it was as easy as poof.\u201d She arched her back, rubbing at the small of it, and making her belly protrude in an alarming fashion. He pressed back against the wall, to give it room. \u201cAs for when, anytime, I expect. No telling for sure.\u201d She picked up the cup and measured out the flour; precious little left in the bag, he noted with some grimness.</p><p>\u201cSend up to the cave when it starts,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll come down, Redcoats or no.\u201d</p><p>Jenny stopped stirring and stared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ian\u2019s not here,\u201d he pointed out, picking up one skinned carcass. With the expertise of long practice, he neatly disjointed a thigh and cut it free from the backbone. Three quick smacks with the boning mallet and the pale flesh lay flattened and ready for the pie.</p><p>\u201cAnd a great lot of help he\u2019d be if he was,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cHe took care of his part o\u2019 the business nine months ago.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at her brother and reached for the plate of butter.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He sat down to continue his work, which brought her belly close to his eye-level. The contents, awake and active, was shifting to and fro in a restless manner, making her apron twitch and bulge as she stirred. He couldn\u2019t resist reaching out to put a light hand against the monstrous curve, to feel the surprising strong thrusts and kicks of the inhabitant, impatient of its cramped confinement.</p><p>\u201cSend Fergus for me when it\u2019s time,\u201d he said again.</p><p>She looked down at him in exasperation and batted his hand away with the spoon. \u201cHave I no just been telling ye, I dinna need ye? For God\u2019s sake, man, have I not enough to worry me, wi\u2019 the house full of people, and scarce enough to feed them, Ian in gaol in Inverness, and Redcoats crawling in at the windows every time I look round? Should I have to worry that ye\u2019ll be taken up, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe needna be worrit for me; I\u2019ll take care.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her, but focused his attention on the forejoint he was slicing through.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, have a care and stay put on the hill.\u201d She looked down her long, straight nose, peering at him over the rim of the bowl. \u201cI\u2019ve had six bairns already, aye? Ye dinna think I can manage by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguing wi\u2019 you, is there?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said promptly. \u201cSo you\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Jenny narrowed her eyes and gave him a long, level look.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re maybe the most stubborn gomerel between here and Aberdeen, no?\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across her brother\u2019s face as he looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he said. He reached across and patted her heaving belly. \u201cAnd maybe no. But I\u2019m coming. Send Fergus when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>It was near dawn three days later that Fergus came panting up the slope to the cave, missing the trail in the dark, and making such a crashing through the gorse bushes that Jamie heard him coming long before he reached the opening.</p><p>\u201cMilord...\u201d he began breathlessly as he emerged by the head of the trail, but Jamie was already past the boy, pulling his cloak around his shoulders as he hurried down toward the house.</p><p>\u201cBut, milord...\u201d Fergus\u2019s voice came behind him, panting and frightened. \u201cMilord, the soldiers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoldiers?\u201d He stopped suddenly and turned, waiting impatiently for the French lad to make his way down the slope. \u201cWhat soldiers?\u201d he demanded, as Fergus slithered the last few feet.</p><p>\u201cEnglish dragoons, milord. Milady sent me to tell you\u2014on no account are you to leave the cave. One of the men saw the soldiers yesterday, camped near Dunmaglas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, milord.\u201d Fergus sat down on a rock and fanned himself, narrow chest heaving as he caught his breath.</p><p>Jamie hesitated, irresolute. Every instinct fought against going back into the cave. His blood was heated by the surge of excitement caused by Fergus\u2019s appearance, and he rebelled at the thought of meekly crawling back into hiding, like a grub seeking refuge beneath its rock.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said. He glanced down at Fergus. The changing light was beginning to outline the boy\u2019s slender form against the blackness of the gorse, but his face was still a pale smudge, marked with a pair of darker smudges that were his eyes. A certain suspicion was stirring in Jamie. Why had his sister sent Fergus at this odd hour?</p><p>If it had been necessary urgently to warn him about the dragoons, it would have been safer to send the boy up during the night. If the need was not urgent, why not wait until the next night? The answer to that was obvious\u2014because Jenny thought she might not be able to send him word the next night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow is it with my sister?\u201d he asked Fergus.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, milord, quite well!\u201d The hearty tone of this assurance confirmed all Jamie\u2019s suspicions.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s having the child, no?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, milord! Certainly not!\u201d</p> <p>Jamie reached down and clamped a hand on Fergus\u2019s shoulder. The bones felt small and fragile beneath his fingers, reminding him uncomfortably of the rabbits he had broken for Jenny. Nonetheless, he forced his grip to tighten. Fergus squirmed, trying to ease away.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth, man,\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cNo, milord! Truly!\u201d</p><p>The grip tightened inexorably. \u201cDid she tell you not to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s prohibition must have been a literal one, for Fergus answered this question with evident relief.</p> <p>\u201cYes, milord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He relaxed his grip and Fergus sprang to his feet, now talking volubly as he rubbed his scrawny shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShe said I must not tell you anything except about the soldiers, milord, for if I did, she would cut off my cods and boil them like turnips and sausage!\u201d</p><p>Jamie could not repress a smile at this threat.</p><p>\u201cShort of food we may be,\u201d he assured his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, \u201cbut not that short.\u201d He glanced at the horizon, where a thin line of pink showed pure and vivid behind the black pines\u2019 silhouette. \u201cCome along, then; it\u2019ll be full light in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>There was no hint of silent emptiness about the house this dawn. Anyone with half an eye could see that things were not as usual at Lallybroch; the wash kettle sat on its plinth in the yard, with the fire gone out under it, full of cold water and sodden clothes. Moaning cries from the barn\u2014like someone being strangled\u2014indicated that the sole remaining cow urgently required milking. An irritable blatting from the goat shed let him know that the female inhabitants would like some similar attention as well.</p> <p>As he came into the yard, three chickens ran past in a feathery squawk, with Jehu the rat terrier in close pursuit. With a quick dart, he leaped forward and booted the dog, catching it just under the ribs. It flew into the air with a look of intense surprise on its face, then, landing with a yip, picked itself up and made off.</p><p>He found the children, the older boys, Mary MacNab, and the other housemaid, Sukie, all crammed into the parlor, under the watchful eye of Mrs. Kirby, a stern and rock-ribbed widow, who was reading to them from the Bible.</p><p>\u201c\u2018And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression,\u2019\u201d read Mrs. Kirby. There was a loud, rolling scream from upstairs, that seemed to go on and on. Mrs. Kirby paused for a moment, to allow everyone to appreciate it, before resuming the reading. Her eyes, pale gray and wet as raw oysters, flickered toward the ceiling, then rested with satisfaction on the row of strained faces before her.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety,\u2019\u201d she read. Kitty burst into hysterical sobbing and buried her head in her sister\u2019s shoulder. Maggie Ellen was growing bright red beneath her freckles, while her elder brother had gone dead-white at the scream.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Kirby,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cBe still, if ye please.\u201d</p><p>The words were civil enough, but the look in his eyes must have been the one that Jehu saw just before his boot-assisted flight, for Mrs. Kirby gasped and dropped the Bible, which landed on the floor with a papery thump.</p><p>Jamie bent and picked it up, then showed Mrs. Kirby his teeth. The expression evidently was not successful as a smile, but had some effect nonetheless. Mrs. Kirby went quite pale, and put a hand to her ample bosom.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps ye\u2019d go to the kitchen and make yourself useful,\u201d he said, with a jerk of his head that sent Sukie the kitchenmaid scuttling out like a windblown leaf. With considerably more dignity, but no hesitation, Mrs. Kirby rose and followed her.</p> <p>Heartened by this small victory, Jamie disposed of the parlor\u2019s other occupants in short order, sending the widow Murray and her daughters out to deal with the wash kettle, the smaller children out to catch chickens under the supervision of Mary MacNab. The older lads departed, with obvious relief, to tend the stock.</p><p>The room empty at last, he stood for a moment, hesitating as to what to do next. He felt obscurely that he should stay in the house, on guard, though he was acutely aware that he could\u2014as Jenny had said\u2014do nothing to help, whatever happened. There was an unfamiliar mule hobbled in the dooryard; presumably the midwife was upstairs with Jenny.</p><p>Unable to sit, he prowled restlessly around the parlor, the Bible in his hand, touching things. Jenny\u2019s bookshelf, battered and scarred from the last incursion of Redcoats, three months ago. The big silver epergne. That was slightly dented, but had been too heavy to fit in a soldier\u2019s knapsack, and so had escaped the pilfering of smaller objects. Not that the English had got so much; the few truly valuable items, along with the tiny store of gold they had left, were safely tucked away in the priest hole with Jared\u2019s wine.</p><p>Hearing a prolonged moan from above, he glanced down involuntarily at the Bible in his hand. Not really wanting to, still he let the book fall open, showing the page at the front where the marriages, births, and deaths of the family were recorded.</p><p>The entries began with his parents\u2019 marriage. Brian Fraser and Ellen MacKenzie. The names and the date were written in his mother\u2019s fine round hand, with underneath, a brief notation in his father\u2019s firmer, blacker scrawl. Marrit for love, it said\u2014a pointed observation, in view of the next entry, which showed Willie\u2019s birth, which had occurred scarcely two months past the date of the marriage.</p><p>Jamie smiled, as always, at sight of the words, and glanced up at the painting of himself, aged two, standing with Willie and Bran, the huge deerhound. All that was left of Willie, who had died of the smallpox at eleven. The painting had a slash through the canvas\u2014the work of a bayonet, he supposed, taking out its owner\u2019s frustration.</p><p>\u201cAnd if ye hadna died,\u201d he said softly to the picture, \u201cthen what?\u201d</p><p>Then what, indeed. Closing the book, his eye caught the last entry\u2014Caitlin Maisri Murray, born December 3, 1749, died December 3, 1749. Aye, if. If the Redcoats had not come on December 2, would Jenny have borne the child too early? If they had had enough food, so that she, like the rest of them, was no more than skin and bones and the bulge of her belly, would that have helped?</p><p>\u201cNo telling, is there?\u201d he said to the painting. Willie\u2019s painted hand rested on his shoulder; he had always felt safe, with Willie standing behind him.</p><p>Another scream came from upstairs, and a spasm of fear clenched his hands on the book.</p><p>\u201cPray for us, Brother,\u201d he whispered, and crossing himself, laid down the Bible and went out to the barn to help with the stock.</p><p>There was little to do here; Rabbie and Fergus between them were more than able to take care of the few animals that remained, and Young Jamie, at ten, was big enough to be a substantial help. Looking about for something to do, Jamie gathered up an armful of scattered hay and took it down the slope to the midwife\u2019s mule. When the hay was gone, the cow would have to be slaughtered; unlike the goats, it couldn\u2019t get enough forage on the winter hills to sustain it, even with the picked grass and weeds the small children brought in. With luck, the salted carcass would last them through \u2019til spring.</p><p>As he came back into the barn, Fergus looked up from his manure fork.</p><p>\u201cThis is a proper midwife, of good repute?\u201d Fergus demanded. He thrust out a long chin aggressively. \u201cMadame should not be entrusted to the care of a peasant, surely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Jamie said testily. \u201cD\u2019ye think I had anything to do wi\u2019 engaging midwives?\u201d Mrs. Martin, the old midwife who had delivered all previous Murray children, had died\u2014like so many others\u2014during the famine in the year following Culloden. Mrs. Innes, the new midwife, was much younger; he hoped she had sufficient experience to know what she was doing.</p><p>Rabbie seemed inclined to join the argument as well. He scowled blackly at Fergus. \u201cAye, and what d\u2019ye mean \u2018peasant\u2019? Ye\u2019re a peasant, too, or have ye not noticed?\u201d</p><p>Fergus stared down his nose at Rabbie with some dignity, despite the fact that he was forced to tilt his head backward in order to do so, he being several inches shorter than his friend.</p><p>\u201cWhether I am a peasant or not is of no consequence,\u201d he said loftily. \u201cI am not a midwife, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ye\u2019re a fiddle-ma-fyke!\u201d Rabbie gave his friend a rough push, and with a sudden whoop of surprise, Fergus fell backward, to land heavily on the stable floor. In a flash, he was up. He lunged at Rabbie, who sat laughing on the edge of the manger, but Jamie\u2019s hand snatched him by the collar and pulled him back.</p><p>\u201cNone of that,\u201d said his employer. \u201cI willna have ye spoilin\u2019 what little hay\u2019s left.\u201d He set Fergus back on his feet, and to distract him, asked, \u201cAnd what d\u2019ye ken of midwives anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great deal, milord.\u201d Fergus dusted himself off with elegant gestures. \u201cMany of the ladies at Madame Elise\u2019s were brought to bed while I was there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay they were,\u201d Jamie interjected dryly. \u201cOr is it childbed ye mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildbed, certainly. Why, I was born there myself!\u201d The French boy puffed his narrow chest importantly.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jamie\u2019s mouth quirked slightly. \u201cWell, and I trust ye made careful observations at the time, so as to say how such matters should be arranged?\u201d</p><p>Fergus ignored this piece of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly, \u201cthe midwife will naturally have put a knife beneath the bed, to cut the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m none so sure she did that,\u201d Rabbie muttered. \u201cAt least it doesna sound much like it.\u201d Most of the screaming was inaudible from the barn, but not all of it.</p><p>\u201cAnd an egg should be blessed with holy water and put at the foot of the bed, so that the woman shall bring forth the child easily,\u201d Fergus continued, oblivious. He frowned.</p><p>\u201cI gave the woman an egg myself, but she did not appear to know what to do with it. And I had been keeping it especially for the last month, too,\u201d he added plaintively, \u201csince the hens scarcely lay anymore. I wanted to be sure of having one when it was needed.</p><p>\u201cNow, following the birth,\u201d he went on, losing his doubts in the enthusiasm of his lecture, \u201cthe midwife must brew a tea of the placenta, and give it to the woman to drink, so that her milk will flow strongly.\u201d</p><p>Rabbie made a faint retching sound. \u201cOf the afterbirth, ye mean?\u201d he said disbelievingly. \u201cGod!\u201d</p><p>Jamie felt a bit queasy at this exhibition of modern medical knowledge himself.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said to Rabbie, striving for casualness, \u201cthey eat frogs, ye know. And snails. I suppose maybe afterbirth isna so strange, considering.\u201d Privately, he wondered whether it might not be long before they were all eating frogs and snails, but thought that a speculation better kept to himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rabbie made mock puking noises. \u201cChrist, who\u2019d be a Frenchie!\u201d</p><p>Fergus, standing close to Rabbie, whirled and shot out a lightning fist. Fergus was small and slender for his age, but strong for all that, and with a deadly aim for a man\u2019s weak points, knowledge acquired as a juvenile pickpocket on the streets of Paris. The blow caught Rabbie squarely in the wind, and he doubled over with a sound like a stepped-on pig\u2019s bladder.</p><p>\u201cSpeak with respect of your betters, if you please,\u201d Fergus said haughtily. Rabbie\u2019s face turned several shades of red and his mouth opened and closed like a fish\u2019s, as he struggled to get his breath back. His eyes bulged with a look of intense surprise, and he looked so ridiculous that it was a struggle for Jamie not to laugh, despite his worry over jenny and his irritation at the boys\u2019 squabbling.</p><p>\u201cWill ye wee doiters no keep your paws off\u2014\u201d he began, when he was interrupted by a cry from Young Jamie, who had until now been silent, fascinated by the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jamie whirled, hand going automatically to the pistol he carried whenever he left the cave, but there was not, as he had half-expected, an English patrol in the stableyard.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it?\u201d he demanded. Then, following Young Jamie\u2019s pointing finger, he saw them. Three small black specks, drifting across the brown crumple of dead vines in the potato field.</p><p>\u201cRavens,\u201d he said softly, and felt the hair rise on the back of his neck. For those birds of war and slaughter to come to a house during a birth was the worst sort of ill luck. One of the filthy beasts was actually settling on the rooftree, as he watched.</p><p>With no conscious thought, he took the pistol from his belt and braced the muzzle across his forearm, sighting carefully. It was a long shot, from the door of the stable to the rooftree, and sighted upward, too. Still...</p><p>The pistol jerked in his hand and the raven exploded in a cloud of black feathers. Its two companions shot into the air as though blown there by the explosion, and flapped madly away, their hoarse cries fading quickly on the winter air.</p> <p>\u201cMon Dieu!\u201d Fergus exclaimed. \u201cC\u2019est bien, \u00e7a!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, bonny shooting, sir.\u201d Rabbie, still red-faced and a little breathless, had recovered himself in time to see the shot. Now he nodded toward the house, pointing with his chin. \u201cLook, sir, is that the midwife?\u201d</p><p>It was. Mrs. Innes poked her head out of the second-story window, fair hair flying loose as she leaned out to peer into the yard below. Perhaps she had been drawn by the sound of the shot, fearing some trouble. Jamie stepped into the stableyard and waved at the window to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he shouted. \u201cOnly an accident.\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to mention the ravens, lest the midwife tell Jenny.</p><p>\u201cCome up!\u201d she shouted, ignoring this. \u201cThe bairn\u2019s born, and your sister wants ye!\u201d</p><p>Jenny opened one eye, blue and slightly slanted like his own.</p> <p>\u201cSo ye came, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought someone should be here\u2014if only to pray for ye,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>She closed the eye and a small smile curved her lips. She looked, he thought, very like a painting he had seen in France\u2014an old one by some Italian fellow, but a good picture, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re a silly fool\u2014and I\u2019m glad of it,\u201d she said softly. She opened her eyes and glanced down at the swaddled bundle she held in the crook of her arm.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a him, is it?\u201d With hands experienced by years of unclehood, he lifted the tiny package and cuddled it against himself, pushing back the flap of blanket that shaded its face.</p><p>Its eyes were closed tight shut, the lashes not visible in the deep crease of the eyelids. The eyelids themselves lay at a sharp angle above the flushed smooth rounds of the cheeks, giving promise that it might\u2014in this one recognizable feature, at least\u2014resemble its mother.</p><p>The head was oddly lumpy, with a lopsided appearance that made Jamie think uncomfortably of a kicked-in melon, but the small fat mouth was relaxed and peaceful, the moist pink underlip quivering faintly with the snore attendant on the exhaustion of being born.</p> <p>\u201cHard work, was it?\u201d he said, speaking to the child, but it was the mother who answered him.</p><p>\u201cAye, it was,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cThere\u2019s whisky in the armoire\u2014will ye fetch me a glass?\u201d Her voice was hoarse and she had to clear her throat before finishing the request.</p><p>\u201cWhisky? Should ye not be having ale wi\u2019 eggs beaten up in it?\u201d he asked, repressing with some difficulty a mental vision of Fergus\u2019s suggestion of appropriate sustenance for newly delivered mothers.</p><p>\u201cWhisky,\u201d his sister said definitely. \u201cWhen ye were lyin\u2019 downstairs crippled and your leg killin\u2019 ye, did I give ye ale wi\u2019 eggs beaten up in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe fed me stuff a damn sight worse than that,\u201d her brother said, with a grin, \u201cbut ye\u2019re right, ye gave me whisky, too.\u201d He laid the sleeping child carefully on the coverlet, and turned to get the whisky.</p><p>\u201cHas he a name, yet?\u201d he asked, nodding toward the baby as he poured out a generous cup of the amber liquid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him Ian, for his Da.\u201d Jenny\u2019s hand rested gently for a moment on the rounded skull, lightly furred with a gold-brown fuzz. A pulse beat visibly in the soft spot on top; it seemed hideously fragile to Jamie, but the midwife had assured him the babe was a fine, lusty lad, and he supposed he must take her word for it. Moved by an obscure impulse to protect that nakedly exposed soft spot, he picked up the baby once more, pulling the blanket up over its head.</p><p>\u201cMary MacNab told me about you and Mrs. Kirby,\u201d Jenny remarked, sipping. \u201cPity I didna see it\u2014she said the wretched auld besom nearly swallowed her tongue when ye spoke to her.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled in return, gently patting the baby\u2019s back as it lay against his shoulder. Dead asleep, the little body lay inert as a boneless ham, a soft comforting weight.</p><p>\u201cToo bad she didn\u2019t. How can ye stand the woman, living in the same house wi\u2019 ye? I\u2019d strangle her, were I here every day.\u201d</p><p>His sister snorted and closed her eyes, tilting her head back to let the whisky slide down her throat.</p><p>\u201cAh, folk fash ye as much as ye let them; I dinna let her, much. Still,\u201d she added, opening her eyes, \u201cI canna say as I\u2019ll be sorry to be rid of her. I have it in my mind to palm her off on auld Kettrick, down at Broch Mordha. His wife and his daughter both died last year, and he\u2019ll be wanting someone to do for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but if I were Samuel Kettrick, I\u2019d take the widow Murray,\u201d Jamie observed, \u201cnot the widow Kirby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeggy Murray\u2019s already provided for,\u201d his sister assured him. \u201cShe\u2019ll wed Duncan Gibbons in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fast work for Duncan,\u201d he said, a little surprised. Then a thought occurred to him, and he grinned at her. \u201cDo either o\u2019 them know it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, grinning back. Then the smile faded into a speculative look.</p><p>\u201cUnless you were thinking of Peggy yourself, that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jamie was as startled as if she had suddenly suggested he might wish to jump out of the second-story window.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only five and twenty,\u201d Jenny pursued. \u201cYoung enough for more bairns, and a good mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much of that whisky have ye had?\u201d Her brother bent forward and pretended to examine the level of the decanter, cupping the baby\u2019s head in one palm to prevent it wobbling. He straightened up and gave his sister a look of mild exasperation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m living like an animal in a cave, and ye wish me to take a wife?\u201d He felt suddenly hollow inside. To prevent her seeing that the suggestion had upset him, he rose and walked up and down the room, making unnecessary small humming noises to the bundle in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHow long is it since ye\u2019ve lain wi\u2019 a woman, Jamie?\u201d his sister asked conversationally behind him. Shocked, he turned on his heel to stare at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell sort of question is that to ask a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not gone wi\u2019 any of the unwed lasses between Lallybroch and Broch Mordha,\u201d she went on, paying no attention. \u201cOr I\u2019d have heard of it. None of the widows, either, I dinna think?\u201d She paused delicately.</p><p>\u201cYe know damn well I haven\u2019t,\u201d he said shortly. He could feel his cheeks flushing with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d his sister asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He stared at her, his mouth slightly open. \u201cHave ye lost your senses? What d\u2019ye think, I\u2019m the sort of man would slink about from house to house, bedding any woman who didna drive me out wi\u2019 a girdle in her hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if they would. No, you\u2019re a good man, Jamie.\u201d Jenny smiled, half sadly. \u201cYe wouldna take advantage of any woman. Ye\u2019d marry first, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said violently. The baby twitched and made a sleepy sound, and he transferred it automatically to his other shoulder, patting, as he glared at his sister. \u201cI dinna mean to marry again, so ye just abandon all thought of matchmaking, Jenny Murray! I willna have it, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I hear,\u201d she said, unperturbed, She pushed herself higher on the pillow, so as to look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYe mean to live a monk to the end of your days?\u201d she asked. \u201cGo to your grave wi\u2019 no son to bury you or bless your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own business, damn ye!\u201d Heart pounding, he turned his back on her and strode to the window, where he stood staring sightlessly out over the stableyard.</p><p>\u201cI ken ye mourn Claire.\u201d His sister\u2019s voice came softly from behind him. \u201cD\u2019ye think I could forget Ian, if he doesna come back? But it\u2019s time ye went on, Jamie. Ye dinna think Claire would mean ye to live alone all your life, with no one to comfort ye or bear your children?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a long time, just stood, feeling the soft heat of the small fuzzy head pressed against the side of his neck. He could see himself dimly in the misted glass, a tall dirty gangle of a man, the round white bundle incongruous beneath his own grim face.</p><p>\u201cShe was with child,\u201d he said softly at last, speaking to the reflection. \u201cWhen she\u2014when I lost her.\u201d How else could he put it? There was no way to tell his sister, where Claire was\u2014where he hoped she was. That he could not think of another woman, hoping that Claire still lived, even knowing her truly lost to him for good.</p><p>There was a long silence from the bed. Then Jenny said quietly, \u201cIs that why ye came today?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and turned sideways toward her, leaning his head against the cool glass. His sister was lying back, her dark hair loose on the pillow, eyes gone soft as she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldna help my wife; I suppose I thought I might help you. Not that I could,\u201d he added, with some bitterness. \u201cI am as useless to you as I was to her.\u201d</p><p>Jenny stretched out a hand to him, face filled with distress. \u201cJamie, mo chridhe,\u201d she said, but then stopped, eyes widening in sudden alarm as a splintering crash and the sound of screams came from the house below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoly Mary!\u201d she said, growing even whiter. \u201cIt\u2019s the English!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d It was as much a prayer as an exclamation of surprise. He glanced quickly from the bed to the window, judging the possibilities of hiding versus those of escape. The sounds of booted feet were already on the stair.</p><p>\u201cThe cupboard, Jamie!\u201d Jenny whispered urgently, pointing. Without hesitation, he stepped into the armoire, and pulled the door to behind him.</p><p>The door of the chamber sprang open with a crash a moment later, to be filled with a red-coated figure in a cocked hat, holding a drawn sword before him. The Captain of dragoons paused, and darted his eyes all round the chamber, finally settling on the small figure in the bed.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Murray?\u201d he said.</p><p>Jenny struggled to pull herself upright.</p><p>\u201cI am. And what in flaming hell are ye doing in my house?\u201d she demanded. Her face was pale and shiny with sweat, and her arms trembled, but she held her chin up and glared at the man. \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>Disregarding her, the man moved into the room and over to the window; Jamie could see his indistinct form disappear past the edge of the wardrobe, then reappear, back turned as he spoke to Jenny.</p><p>\u201cOne of my scouts reported hearing a shot from the vicinity of this house, not long since. Where are your men?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have none.\u201d Her trembling arms would not support her longer, and Jamie saw his sister ease herself back, collapsing on the pillows. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken my husband already\u2014my eldest son is no more than ten.\u201d She did not mention Rabbie or Fergus; boys of their age were old enough to be treated\u2014or mistreated\u2014as men, should the Captain take the notion. With luck, they would have taken to their heels at the first sight of the English.</p><p>The Captain was a hard-bitten man of middle age, and not overly given to credulity.</p><p>\u201cThe keeping of weapons in the Highlands is a serious offense,\u201d he said, and turned to the soldier who had come into the room behind him. \u201cSearch the house, Jenkins.\u201d</p><p>He had to raise his voice in the giving of the order, for there was a rising commotion in the stairwell. As Jenkins turned to leave the room, Mrs. Innes, the midwife, burst past the soldier who tried to bar her way.</p><p>\u201cLeave the poor lady alone!\u201d she cried, facing the Captain with fists clenched at her sides. The midwife\u2019s voice shook and her hair was coming down from its snood, but she stood her ground. \u201cGet out, ye wretches! Leave her be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not mistreating your mistress,\u201d the Captain said, with some irritation, evidently mistaking Mrs. Innes for one of the maids. \u201cI am merely\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd her not delivered but an hour since! It isna decent even for ye to lay eyes on her, so much as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelivered?\u201d The Captain\u2019s voice sharpened, and he glanced from the midwife to the bed in sudden interest. \u201cYou have borne a child, Mrs. Murray? Where is the infant?\u201d</p><p>The infant in question stirred inside its wrappings, disturbed by the tightened grip of its horror-stricken uncle.</p><p>From the depths of the wardrobe, he could see his sister\u2019s face, white to the lips and set like stone.</p><p>\u201cThe child is dead,\u201d she said.</p><p>The midwife\u2019s mouth dropped open in shock, but luckily the Captain\u2019s attention was riveted on Jenny.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWas it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d The cry of anguish came from the doorway as Young Jamie broke free of a soldier\u2019s grip and hurled himself at his mother. \u201cMama, the baby\u2019s dead? No, no!\u201d Sobbing, he flung himself on his knees and buried his head in the bedclothes.</p> <p>As though to refute his brother\u2019s statement, baby Ian gave evidence of his living state by kicking his legs with considerable vigor against his uncle\u2019s ribs and emitting a series of small snuffling grunts, which fortunately went unheard in the commotion outside.</p><p>Jenny was trying to comfort Young Jamie, Mrs. Innes was futilely attempting to raise the boy, who kept a death grip on his mother\u2019s sleeve, the Captain was vainly trying to make himself heard above Young Jamie\u2019s grief-stricken wails, and over all, the muted sound of boots and shouting vibrated through the house.</p><p>Jamie rather thought the Captain was inquiring as to the location of the infant\u2019s body. He clutched the body in question closer, joggling it in an attempt to prevent any disposition on its part to cry. His other hand went to the hilt of his dirk, but it was a vain gesture; it was doubtful that even cutting his own throat would be of help, if the wardrobe were opened.</p><p>Baby Ian made an irascible noise, suggesting that he disliked being joggled. With visions of the house in flames and the inhabitants slaughtered, the noise sounded as loud to Jamie as his elder nephew\u2019s anguished howls.</p><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d Young Jamie had gotten to his feet, face wet and swollen with tears and rage, and was advancing on the Captain, curly black head lowered like a small ram\u2019s. \u201cYou killed my brother, ye English prick!\u201d</p><p>The Captain was somewhat taken aback by this sudden attack, and actually took a step back, blinking at the boy. \u201cNo, boy, you\u2019re quite mistaken. Why, I only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrick! Cod! A mhic an diabhoil!\u201d Entirely beside himself, Young Jamie was stalking the Captain, yelling every obscenity he had ever heard used, in Gaelic or English.</p><p>\u201cEnh,\u201d said baby Ian in the elder Jamie\u2019s ear. \u201cEnh, enh!\u201d This sounded very much like the preliminary to a full-fledged screech, and in a panic, Jamie let go of his dirk and thrust his thumb into the soft, moist opening from which the sounds were issuing. The baby\u2019s toothless gums clamped onto his thumb with a ferocity that nearly made him exclaim aloud.</p><p>\u201cGet out! Get out! Get out or I\u2019ll kill ye!\u201d Young Jamie was screaming at the Captain, face contorted with rage. The Redcoat looked helplessly at the bed, as though to ask Jenny to call off this implacable small foe, but she lay as though dead with her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI shall wait for my men downstairs,\u201d the Captain said, with what dignity he could, and withdrew, shutting the door hastily behind him. Deprived of his enemy, Young Jamie fell to the floor and collapsed into helpless weeping.</p><p>Through the crack in the door, Jamie saw Mrs. Innes look at Jenny, mouth opening to ask a question. Jenny shot up from the bedclothes like Lazarus, scowling ferociously, finger pressed to her lips to enjoin silence. Baby Ian champed viciously at the thumb, growling at its failure to yield any sustenance.</p><p>Jenny swung herself to the side of the bed and sat there, waiting. The sounds of the soldiers below throbbed and eddied through the house. Jenny was shaking with weakness, but she reached out a hand toward the armoire where her men lay hidden.</p><p>Jamie drew a deep breath and braced himself. It would have to be risked; his hand and wrist were wet with saliva, and the baby\u2019s growls of frustration were growing louder.</p><p>He stumbled from the wardrobe, drenched with sweat, and thrust the infant at Jenny. Baring her breast with a single wrench, she pressed the small head to her nipple, and bent over the tiny bundle, as though to protect it. The beginnings of a squawk disappeared into the muffled sounds of vigorous sucking, and Jamie sat down on the floor quite suddenly, feeling as though someone had run a sword behind his knees.</p><p>Young Jamie had sat up at the sudden opening of the wardrobe, and now sat spraddled against the door, his face blank with bewildered shock as he looked from his mother to his uncle and back again. Mrs. Innes knelt beside him, whispering urgently in his ear, but no sign of comprehension showed on the small, tear-streaked face.</p><p>By the time shouts and the creaking of harness outside betokened the soldiers\u2019 departure, Young Ian lay replete and snoring in his mother\u2019s arms. Jamie stood by the window, just out of sight, watching them go.</p><p>The room was silent, save for the liquid noise of Mrs. Innes, drinking whisky. Young Jamie sat close against his mother, cheek pressed to her shoulder. She had not looked up once since taking the baby, and still sat, head lowered over the child in her lap, her black hair hiding her face.</p><p>Jamie stepped forward and touched her shoulder. The warmth of her seemed shocking, as though cold dread were his natural state and the touch of another person somehow foreign and unnatural.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the priest hole,\u201d he said softly, \u201cand to the cave when it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p><p>Jenny nodded, but without looking up at him. There were several white hairs among the black, he saw, glinting silver by the parting down the center of her head.</p><p>\u201cI think...I should not come down again,\u201d he said at last. \u201cFor a time.\u201d</p><p>Jenny said nothing, but nodded once more.</p><p>6</p><p>BEING NOW JUSTIFIED BY HIS BLOOD</p><p>As it was, he did come down to the house once more. For two months, he stayed close hidden in the cave, scarcely daring to come out at night to hunt, for the English soldiers were still in the district, quartered at Comar. The troops went out by day in small patrols of eight or ten, combing the countryside, looting what little there was to steal, destroying what they could not use. And all with the blessing of the English Crown.</p><p>A path led close by the base of the hill where his cavern was concealed. No more than a rude track, it had begun as a deer path, and still largely served that use, though it was a foolish stag that would venture within smelling distance of the cave. Still, sometimes when the wind was right, he would see a small group of the red deer on the path, or find fresh spoor in the exposed mud of the track next day.</p><p>It was helpful as well for such people as had business on the mountainside\u2014few enough as those were. The wind had been blowing downwind from the cave, and he had no expectation of seeing deer. He had been lying on the ground just within the cave entrance, where enough light filtered through the overhanging screen of gorse and rowan for him to read on fine days. There were not a great many books, but Jared managed still to smuggle a few with his gifts from France.</p><p>This violent rain forced me to a new work, viz., to cut a hole through my new fortification, like a sink, to let the water go out, which would else have drowned my cave. After I had been in my cave some time, and found still no more shocks of the earthquake follow, I began to be more composed; and now, to support my spirits, which indeed wanted it very much, I went to my little store and took a small sup of rum, which however, I did then and always very sparingly, knowing I could have no more when that was gone.</p><p>It continued raining all that night, and great part of the next day, so that I could not stir abroad; but my mind being more composed, I began to think...</p><p>The shadows across the page moved as the bushes above him stirred. Instincts attuned, he caught the shift of the wind at once\u2014and on it, the sound of voices.</p><p>He sprang to his feet, hand on the dirk that never left his side. Barely pausing to put the book carefully on its ledge, he grasped the knob of granite that he used as a handhold and pulled himself up into the steep narrow crevice that formed the cave\u2019s entrance.</p><p>The bright flash of red and metal on the path below hit him with a blow of shock and annoyance. Damn. He had little fear that any of the soldiers would leave the path\u2014they were poorly equipped for making their way even through the normal stretches of open, spongy peat and heather, let alone an overgrown, brambly slope like this\u2014but having them so close meant he could not risk leaving the cave before dark, even to get water or relieve himself. He cast a quick glance at his water jug, knowing as he did so that it was nearly empty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A shout pulled his attention back to the track below, and he nearly lost his grip on the rock. The soldiers had bunched themselves around a small figure, humped under the weight of a small cask it bore on its shoulder. Fergus, on his way up with a cask of fresh-brewed ale. Damn, and damn again. He could have done with that ale; it had been months since he\u2019d had any.</p><p>The wind had changed again, so he caught only small snatches of words, but the small figure seemed to be arguing with the soldier in front of him, gesticulating violently with its free hand.</p><p>\u201cIdiot!\u201d said Jamie, under his breath. \u201cGive it to them and begone, ye wee clot!\u201d</p><p>One soldier made a two-handed grab at the cask, and missed as the small dark-haired figure jumped nimbly back. Jamie smacked himself on the forehead with exasperation. Fergus could never resist insolence when confronted with authority\u2014especially English authority.</p> <p>The small figure now was skipping backward, shouting something at his pursuers.</p><p>\u201cFool!\u201d Jamie said violently. \u201cDrop it and run!\u201d</p><p>Instead of either dropping the cask or running, Fergus, apparently sure, of his own speed, turned his back on the soldiers and waggled his rump insultingly at them. Sufficiently incensed to risk their footing in the soggy vegetation, several of the Redcoats jumped the path to follow.</p><p>Jamie saw their leader raise an arm and shout in warning. It had evidently dawned on him that Fergus might be a decoy, trying to lead them into ambush. But Fergus too was shouting, and evidently the soldiers knew enough gutter French to interpret what he was saying, for while several of the men halted at their leader\u2019s shout, four of the soldiers hurled themselves at the dancing boy.</p><p>There was a scuffle and more shouting as Fergus dodged, twisting like an eel between the soldiers. In all the commotion and above the whining wind, Jamie could not have heard the rush of the saber being drawn from its scabbard, but ever after felt as though he had, as though the faint swish and ring of drawn metal had been the first inkling of disaster. It seemed to ring in his ears whenever he remembered the scene\u2014and he remembered it for a very long time.</p> <p>Perhaps it was something in the attitudes of the soldiers, an irritableness of mood that communicated itself to him in the cave. Perhaps only the sense of doom that had clung to him since Culloden, as though everything in his vicinity were tainted; at risk by virtue only of being near him. Whether he had heard the sound of the saber or not, his body had tensed itself to spring before he saw the silver arc of the blade swing through the air.</p><p>It moved almost lazily, slowly enough for his brain to have tracked its arc, deduced its target, and shouted, wordless, no! Surely it moved slowly enough that he could have darted down into the midst of the swarming men, seized the wrist that wielded the sword and twisted the deadly length of metal free, to tumble harmless to the ground.</p><p>The conscious part of his brain told him this was nonsense, even as it froze his hands around the granite knob, anchoring him against the overwhelming impulse to heave himself out of the earth and run forward.</p><p>You can\u2019t, it said to him, a thready whisper under the fury and the horror that filled him. He has done this for you; you cannot make it senseless. You can\u2019t, it said, cold as death beneath the searing rush of futility that drowned him. You can do nothing.</p><p>And he did nothing, nothing but watch, as the blade completed its lazy swing, crashed home with a small, almost inconsequential thunk! and the disputed cask tumbled end over end over end down the slope of the burn, its final splash lost in the merry gurgle of brown water far below.</p><p>The shouting ceased abruptly in shocked silence. He scarcely heard when it resumed; it sounded so much like the roaring in his ears. His knees gave way, and he realized dimly that he was about to faint. His vision darkened into reddish black, shot with stars and streaks of light\u2014but not even the encroaching dark would blot out the final sight of Fergus\u2019s hand, that small and deft and clever pickpocket\u2019s hand, lying still in the mud of the track, palm turned upward in supplication.</p> <p>He waited for forty-eight long, dragging hours before Rabbie MacNab came to whistle on the path below the cave.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d he said without preliminary.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Jenny says he\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Rabbie answered. His young face was pale and drawn; plainly he had not yet recovered from the shock of his friend\u2019s accident. \u201cShe says he\u2019s not fevered, and there\u2019s no trace of rot yet in the\u201d\u2014he swallowed audibly\u2014\u201cin the...stump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe soldiers took him down to the house, then?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, he was already making his way down the hillside.</p><p>\u201cAye, they were all amoil wi\u2019 it\u2014I think\u201d\u2014Rabbie paused to distentangle his shirt from a clinging brier, and had to hurry to catch up with his employer\u2014\u201cI think they were sorry about it. The Captain said so, at least. And he gave Mrs. Jenny a gold sovereign\u2014for Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Jamie said. \u201cVerra generous.\u201d And did not speak again, until they reached the house.</p><p>Fergus was lying in state in the nursery, ensconced in a bed by the window. His eyes were closed when Jamie entered the room, long lashes lying softly against thin cheeks. Seen without its customary animation, his usual array of grimaces and poses, his face looked quite different. The slightly beaked nose above the long, mobile mouth gave him a faintly aristocratic air, and the bones hardening beneath the skin gave some promise that his face might one day pass from boyish charm to outright handsomeness.</p><p>Jamie moved toward the bed, and the dark lashes lifted at once.</p> <p>\u201cMilord,\u201d Fergus said, and a weak smile restored his face at once to its familiar contours. \u201cYou are safe here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, laddie, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Jamie sank to his knees by the bed. He could scarcely bear to look at the slender forearm that lay across the quilt, its frail bandaged wrist ending in nothing, but forced himself to grip Fergus\u2019s shoulder in greeting, and rub a palm gently over the shock of dark hair.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt much?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, milord,\u201d Fergus said. Then a sudden belying twinge of pain crossed his features, and he grinned shamefacedly. \u201cWell, not so much. And Madame has been most generous with the whisky.\u201d</p><p>There was a tumbler full of it on the sidetable, but no more than a thimbleful had been drunk. Fergus, weaned on French wine, did not really like the taste of whisky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jamie said again. There was nothing else to say. Nothing he could say, for the tightening in his throat. He looked hastily down, knowing that it would upset Fergus to see him weep.</p><p>\u201cAh, milord, do not trouble yourself.\u201d There was a note of the old mischief in Fergus\u2019s voice. \u201cMe, I have been fortunate.\u201d</p><p>Jamie swallowed hard before replying.</p><p>\u201cAye, you\u2019re alive\u2014and thank God for it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, beyond that, milord!\u201d He glanced up to see Fergus smiling, though still very pale. \u201cDo you not recall our agreement, milord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, when you took me into your service in Paris. You told me then that should I be arrested and executed, you would have Masses said for my soul for the space of a year.\u201d The remaining hand fluttered toward the battered greenish medal that hung about his neck\u2014St. Dismas, patron saint of thieves. \u201cBut if I should lose an ear or a hand while doing your service\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would support you for the rest of your life.\u201d Jamie was unsure whether to laugh or cry, and contented himself with patting the hand that now lay quiet on the quilt. \u201cAye, I remember. You may trust me to keep the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have always trusted you, milord,\u201d Fergus assured him. Clearly he was growing tired; the pale cheeks were even whiter than they had been, and the shock of black hair fell back against the pillow. \u201cSo I am fortunate,\u201d he murmured, still smiling. \u201cFor in one stroke, I am become a gentleman of leisure, non?\u201d</p><p>Jenny was waiting for him when he left Fergus\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cCome down to the priest hole wi\u2019 me,\u201d he said, taking her by the elbow. \u201cI need to talk wi\u2019 ye a bit, and I shouldna stay in the open longer.\u201d</p><p>She followed him without comment, down to the stone-floored back hall that separated kitchen and pantry. Set into the flags of the floor was a large wooden panel, perforated with drilled holes, apparently mortared into the floorstones. Theoretically, this gave air to the root cellar below, and in fact\u2014should any suspicious person choose to investigate, the root cellar, reached by a sunken door outside the house, did have just such a panel set into its ceiling.</p><p>What was not apparent was that the panel also gave light and air to a small priest hole that had been built just behind the root cellar, which could be reached by pulling up the panel, mortared frame and all, to reveal a short ladder leading down into the tiny room.</p><p>It was no more than five feet square, equipped with nothing in the way of furniture beyond a rude bench, a blanket, and a chamber pot. A large jug of water and a small box of hard biscuit completed the chamber\u2019s accoutrements. It had in fact been added to the house only within the last few years, and therefore was not really a priest hole, as no priest had occupied it or was likely to. A hole it definitely was, though.</p><p>Two people could occupy the hole only by sitting side by side on the bench, and Jamie sat down beside his sister as soon as he had replaced the panel overhead and descended the ladder. He sat still for a moment, then took a breath and started.</p><p>\u201cI canna bear it anymore,\u201d he said. He spoke so softly that Jenny was forced to bend her head close to hear him, like a priest receiving some penitent\u2019s confession. \u201cI can\u2019t. I must go.\u201d</p><p>They sat so close together that he could feel the rise and fall of her breast as she breathed. Then she reached out and took hold of his hand, her small firm fingers tight on his.</p><p>\u201cWill ye try France again, then?\u201d He had tried to escape to France twice before, thwarted each time by the tight watch the English placed on all ports. No disguise was sufficient for a man of his remarkable height and coloring.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. I shall let myself be captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d In her agitation, Jenny allowed her voice to rise momentarily, then lowered it again in response to the warning squeeze of his hand.</p><p>\u201cJamie, ye canna do that!\u201d she said, lower. \u201cChrist, man, ye\u2019ll be hangit!\u201d</p><p>He kept his head bent as though in thought, but shook it, not hesitating.</p><p>\u201cI think not.\u201d He glanced at his sister, then quickly away. \u201cClaire\u2014she had the Sight.\u201d As good an explanation as any, he thought, if not quite the real truth. \u201cShe saw what would happen at Culloden\u2014she knew. And she told me what would come after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d said Jenny softly. \u201cI wondered. So that was why she bade me plant potatoes\u2014and build this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He gave his sister\u2019s hand a small squeeze, then let go and turned slightly on the narrow seat to face her. \u201cShe told me that the Crown would go on hunting Jacobite traitors for some time\u2014and they have,\u201d he added wryly. \u201cBut that after the first few years, they would no longer execute the men that were captured\u2014only imprison them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly!\u201d his sister echoed. \u201cIf ye mun go, Jamie, take to the heather then, but to give yourself up to an English prison, whether they\u2019ll hang ye or no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d His hand on her arm stopped her. \u201cI havena told it all to ye yet. I dinna mean just to walk up to the English and surrender. There\u2019s a goodly price on my head, no? Be a shame to let that go to waste, d\u2019ye not think?\u201d He tried to force a smile in his voice; she heard it and glanced sharply up at him.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mother,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo ye mean to have someone betray ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemingly, aye.\u201d He had decided upon the plan, alone in the cave, but it had not seemed quite real until now. \u201cI thought perhaps Joe Fraser would be best for it.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny rubbed her fist hard against her lips. She was quick; he knew she had grasped the plan at once\u2014and all its implications.</p><p>\u201cBut Jamie,\u201d she whispered. \u201cEven if they dinna hang ye outright\u2014and that\u2019s the hell of a risk to take\u2014Jamie, ye could be killed when they take ye!\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped suddenly, under the weight of misery and exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cGod, Jenny,\u201d he said, \u201cd\u2019ye think I care?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence before she answered.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I canna say as I blame ye, either.\u201d She paused a moment, to steady her voice. \u201cBut I still care.\u201d Her fingers gently touched the back of his head, stroking his hair. \u201cSo ye\u2019ll mind yourself, won\u2019t ye, clot-heid?\u201d</p><p>The ventilation panel overhead darkened momentarily, and there was the tapping sound of light footsteps. One of the kitchenmaids, on her way to the pantry, perhaps. Then the dim light came back, and he could see Jenny\u2019s face once more.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he whispered at last. \u201cI\u2019ll mind.\u201d</p><p>It took more than two months to complete the arrangements. When at last word came, it was full spring.</p><p>He sat on his favorite rock, near the cave\u2019s entrance, watching the evening stars come out. Even in the worst of the year after Culloden, he had always been able to find a moment of peace at this time of the day. As the daylight faded, it was as though objects became faintly lit from within, so they stood outlined against sky or ground, perfect and sharp in every detail. He could see the shape of a moth, invisible in the light, now limned in the dusk with a triangle of deeper shadow that made it stand out from the trunk it hid upon. In a moment, it would take wing.</p><p>He looked out across the valley, trying to stretch his eyes as far as the black pines that edged the distant cliffside. Then up, among the stars. Orion there, striding stately over the horizon. And the Pleiades, barely visible in the darkening sky. It might be his last sight of the sky for some time, and he meant to enjoy it. He thought of prison, of bars and locks and solid walls, and remembered Fort William. Wentworth Prison. The Bastille. Walls of stone, four feet thick, that blocked all air and light. Filth, stench, hunger, entombment...</p> <p>He shrugged such thoughts away. He had chosen his way, and was satisfied with it. Still, he searched the sky, looking for Taurus. Not the prettiest of constellations, but his own. Born under the sign of the bull, stubborn and strong. Strong enough, he hoped, to do what he intended.</p><p>Among the growing night sounds, there was a sharp, high whistle. It might have been the homing song of a curlew on the loch, but he recognized the signal. Someone was coming up the path\u2014a friend.</p><p>It was Mary MacNab, who had become kitchenmaid at Lallybroch, after the death of her husband. Usually it was her son Rabbie, or Fergus, who brought him food and news, but she had come a few times before.</p><p>She had brought a basket, unusually well-supplied, with a cold roast partridge, fresh bread, several young green onions, a bunch of early cherries, and a flask of ale. Jamie examined the bounty, then looked up with a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cMy farewell feast, eh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, silent. She was a small woman, dark hair heavily streaked with gray, and her face lined by the difficulties of life. Still, her eyes were soft and brown, and her lips still full and gently curved.</p><p>He realized that he was staring at her mouth, and hastily turned again to the basket.</p><p>\u201cLord, I\u2019ll be so full I\u2019ll not be able to move. Even a cake, now! However did ye ladies manage that?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged\u2014she wasn\u2019t a great chatterer, Mary MacNab\u2014and taking the basket from him, proceeded to lay the meal on the wooden tabletop, balanced on stones. She laid places for both of them. This was nothing out of the ordinary; she had supped with him before, to give him the gossip of the district while they ate. Still, if this was his last meal before leaving Lallybroch, he was surprised that neither his sister nor the boys had come to share it. Perhaps the farmhouse had visitors that would make it difficult for them to leave undetected.</p><p>He gestured politely for her to sit first, before taking his own place, crosslegged on the hard dirt floor.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve spoken wi\u2019 Joe Fraser? Where is it to be, then?\u201d he asked, taking a bite of cold partridge.</p><p>She told him the details of the plan; a horse would be brought before dawn, and he would ride out of the narrow valley by way of the pass. Then turn, cross the rocky foothills and come down, back into the valley by Feesyhant\u2019s Burn, as though he were coming home. The English would meet him somewhere between Struy and Eskadale, most likely at Midmains; it was a good place for an ambush, for the glen rose steeply there on both sides, but with a wooded patch by the stream where several men could conceal themselves.</p><p>After the meal, she packed the basket tidily, leaving out enough food for a small breakfast before his dawn leaving. He expected her to go then, but she did not. She rummaged in the crevice where he kept his bedding, spread it neatly upon the floor, turned back the blankets and knelt beside the pallet, hands folded on her lap.</p><p>He leaned back against the wall of the cave, arms folded. He looked down at the crown of her bowed head in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cOh, like that, is it?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd whose idea was this? Yours, or my sister\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She was composed, her hands perfectly still on her lap, her dark hair smooth in its snood.</p><p>He shook his head and bent down to pull her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesna matter, because it\u2019s no going to happen. I appreciate your meaning, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>His speech was interrupted by her kiss. Her lips were as soft as they looked. He grasped her firmly by both wrists and pushed her away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said. \u201cIt isna necessary, and I dinna want to do it.\u201d He was uncomfortably aware that his body did not agree at all with his assessments of necessity, and still more uncomfortable at the knowledge that his breeches, too small and worn thin, made the magnitude of the disagreement obvious to anyone who cared to look. The slight smile curving those full, sweet lips suggested that she was looking.</p><p>He turned her toward the entrance and gave her a light push, to which she responded by stepping aside and reaching behind her for the fastenings to her skirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cHow dye mean to stop me?\u201d she asked, stepping out of the garment and folding it tidily over the single stool. Her slender fingers went to the laces of her bodice.</p><p>\u201cIf ye won\u2019t leave, then I\u2019ll have to,\u201d he replied with decision. He whirled on his heel and headed for the cave entrance, when he heard her voice behind him.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d she said.</p><p>He stopped, but did not turn around. \u201cIt isna suitable to call me that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLallybroch is yours,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd will be so long as ye live. If ye\u2019re its laird, I\u2019ll call ye so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isna mine. The estate belongs to Young Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isna Young Jamie that\u2019s doing what you are,\u201d she answered with decision. \u201cAnd it isna your sister that\u2019s asked me to do what I\u2019m doin\u2019. Turn round.\u201d</p><p>He turned, reluctantly. She stood barefoot in her shift, her hair loose over her shoulders. She was thin, as they all were these days, but her br**sts were larger than he had thought, and the ni**les showed prominently through the thin fabric. The shift was as worn as her other garments, frayed at the hem and shoulders, almost transparent in spots. He closed his eyes.</p><p>He felt a light touch on his arm, and willed himself to stand still.</p><p>\u201cI ken weel enough what ye\u2019re thinkin\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cFor I saw your lady, and I know how it was between the two of ye. I never had that,\u201d she added, in a softer voice, \u201cnot wi\u2019 either of the two men I wed. But I know the look of a true love, and it\u2019s not in my mind to make ye feel ye\u2019ve betrayed it.\u201d</p><p>The touch, feather-light, moved to his cheek, and a work-worn thumb traced the groove that ran from nose to mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cis to give ye something different. Something less, mayhap, but something ye can use; something to keep ye whole. Your sister and the bairns canna give ye that\u2014but I can.\u201d He heard her draw breath, and the touch on his face lifted away.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve given me my home, my life, and my son. Will ye no let me gi\u2019e ye this small thing in return?\u201d</p><p>He felt tears sting his eyelids. The weightless touch moved across his face, wiping the moisture from his eyes, smoothing the roughness of his hair. He lifted his arms, slowly, and reached out. She stepped inside his embrace, as neatly and simply as she had laid the table and the bed.</p><p>\u201cI...havena done this in a long time,\u201d he said, suddenly shy.</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d she said, with a tiny smile. \u201cBut we\u2019ll remember how \u2019tis.\u201d</p><p>PART THREE</p><p>When I Am Thy Captive</p><p>7</p><p>A FAITH IN DOCUMENTS</p><p>Inverness</p><p>May 25, 1968</p><p>The envelope from Linklater arrived in the morning post.</p><p>\u201cLook how fat it is!\u201d Brianna exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s sent something!\u201d The tip of her nose was pink with excitement.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it,\u201d said Roger. He was outwardly calm, but I could see the pulse beating in the hollow of his throat. He picked up the thick manila envelope and held it for a moment, weighing it. Then he ripped the flap recklessly with his thumb, and yanked out a sheaf of photocopied pages.</p><p>The cover letter, on heavy university stationery, fluttered out. I snatched it from the floor and read it aloud, my voice shaking a little.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dear Dr. Wakefield,\u2019\u201d I read. \u201c\u2018This is in reply to your inquiry regarding the execution of Jacobite officers by the Duke of Cumberland\u2019s troops following the Battle of Culloden. The main source of the quote in my book to which you refer, was the private journal of one Lord Melton, in command of an infantry regiment under Cumberland at the time of Culloden. I have enclosed photocopies of the relevant pages of the journal; as you will see, the story of the survivor, one James Fraser, is an odd and touching one. Fraser is not an important historical character, and not in line with the thrust of my own work, but I have often thought of investigating further, in hopes of determining his eventual fate. Should you find that he did survive the journey to his own estate, I should be happy if you would inform me. I have always rather hoped that he did, though his situation as described by Melton makes the possibility seem unlikely. Sincerely yours, Eric Linklater.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The paper rattled in my hand, and I set it down, very carefully, on the desk.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely, huh?\u201d Brianna said, standing on tiptoe to see over Roger\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHa! He did make it back, we know he did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think he did,\u201d Roger corrected, but it was only scholarly caution; his grin was as broad as Brianna\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWill ye be havin\u2019 tea or cocoa to your elevenses?\u201d Fiona\u2019s curly dark head poked through the study doorway, interrupting the excitement. \u201cThere\u2019s fresh ginger-nut biscuits, just baked.\u201d The scent of warm ginger came into the study with her, wafting enticingly from her apron.</p> <p>\u201cTea, please,\u201d said Roger, just as Brianna said, \u201cOh, cocoa sounds great!\u201d Fiona, wearing a smug expression, pushed in the tea cart, sporting both tea cozy and pot of cocoa, as well as a plate of fresh ginger-nut biscuits.</p><p>I accepted a cup of tea myself, and sat down in the wing chair with the pages of Melton\u2019s journal. The flowing eighteenth-century handwriting was surprisingly clear, in spite of the archaic spelling, and within minutes, I was in the confines of Leanach farmhouse, imagining the sound of buzzing flies, the stir of close-packed bodies, and the harsh smell of blood soaking into the packed-dirt floor.</p><p>\u201c...in satisfaction of my brother\u2019s debt of honor, I could not do otherwise than to spare Fraser\u2019s life. I therefore omitted his name from the list of traitors executed at the farmhouse, and have made arrangement for his transport to his own estate. I cannot feel myself either altogether merciful toward Fraser in the taking of this action, nor yet altogether culpable with respect to my service toward the Duke, as Fraser\u2019s situation, with a great wound in his leg festering and pustulent, makes it unlikely that he will survive the journey to his home. Still, honor prevents my acting otherwise, and I will confess that my spirit was lightened to see the man removed, still living, from the field, as I turned my own attentions to the melancholy task of disposing of the bodies of his comrades. So much killing as I have seen these last two days oppresses me,\u201d the entry ended simply.</p><p>I laid the pages down on my knee, swallowing heavily. \u201cA great wound...festering and pustulent...\u201d I knew, as Roger and Brianna could not, just how serious such a wound would have been, with no antibiotics, nothing in the way of proper medical treatment; not even the crude herbal poultices available to a Highland charmer at the time. How long would it have taken, jolting from Culloden to Broch Tuarach in a wagon? Two days? Three? How could he have lived, in such a state, and neglected for so long?</p><p>\u201cHe did, though.\u201d Brianna\u2019s voice broke in upon my thoughts, answering what seemed to be a similar thought expressed by Roger. She spoke with simple assurance, as though she had seen all the events described in Melton\u2019s journal, and were sure of their outcome. \u201cHe did get back. He was the Dunbonnet, I know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Dunbonnet?\u201d Fiona, tut-tutting over my cold cup of undrunk tea, looked over her shoulder in surprise. \u201cHeard of the Dunbonnet, have ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Roger looked at the young housekeeper in astonishment.</p><p>She nodded, casually dumping my tea into the aspidistra that stood by the hearth and refilling my cup with fresh steaming brew.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. My grannie tellt me that tale, often and often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us!\u201d Brianna leaned forward, intent, her cocoa cupped between her palms. \u201cPlease, Fiona! What\u2019s the story?\u201d</p><p>Fiona seemed mildly surprised to find herself suddenly the center of so much attention, but shrugged good-naturedly.</p> <p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s just the story of one o\u2019 the followers o\u2019 the Bonnie Prince. When there was the great defeat at Culloden, and sae many were killed, a few escaped. Why, one man fled the field and swam the river to get away, but the Redcoats were after him, nonetheless. He came to a kirk along his way, and a service going on inside, and he dashing in, prayed mercy from the minister. The minister and the people took pity on him, and he put on the minister\u2019s robe, so when the Redcoats burst in moments later, there he was, standing at the pulpit, preachin\u2019 the sermon, and the water from his beard and clothes puddled up about his feet. The Redcoats thought they were mistaken, and went on down the road, and so he escaped\u2014and everyone in the kirk said \u2019twas the best sermon they ever heard!\u201d Fiona laughed heartily, while Brianna frowned, and Roger looked puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThat was the Dunbonnet?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no!\u201d she assured him. \u201cThat was no the Dunbonnet\u2014only the Dunbonnet was another o\u2019 the men who got away from Culloden. He came back to his own estate, but because the Sassenachs were hunting men all across the Highlands, he lay hidden there in a cave for seven years.\u201d</p><p>Hearing this, Brianna slumped back in her chair with a sigh of relief. \u201cAnd his tenants called him the Dunbonnet so as not to speak his name and betray him,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYe ken the story?\u201d Fiona asked, astonished. \u201cAye, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did your grannie say what happened to him after that?\u201d Roger prompted.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye!\u201d Fiona\u2019s eyes were round as butterscotch drops. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part o\u2019 the story. See, there was a great famine after Culloden; folk were starvin\u2019 in the glens, turned out of their houses in winter, the men shot and the cots set afire. The Dunbonnet\u2019s tenants managed better than most, but even so, there came a day when the food ran out, and their bellies garbeled from dawn \u2019til dark\u2014no game in the forest, nay grain in the field, and the weans dyin\u2019 in their mothers\u2019 arms for lack o\u2019 milk to feed them.\u201d</p><p>A cold chill swept over me at her words. I saw the faces of the Lallybroch inhabitants\u2014the people I had known and loved\u2014pinched with cold and starvation. Not only horror filled me; there was guilt, too. I had been safe, warm, and well-fed, instead of sharing their fate\u2014because I had done as Jamie wanted, and left them. I looked at Brianna, smooth red head bent in absorption, and the tight feeling in my chest eased a bit. She too had been safe for these past years, warm, well-fed, and loved\u2014because I had done as Jamie wanted.</p> <p>\u201cSo he made a bold plan, the Dunbonnet did,\u201d Fiona was continuing. Her round face was alight with the drama of her tale. \u201cHe arranged that one of his tenants should go to the English, and offer to betray him. There was a good price on his head, for he\u2019d been a great warrior for the Prince. The tenant would take the gold o\u2019 the reward\u2014to use for the folk on the estate, o\u2019 course\u2014and tell the English where the Dunbonnet might be taken.\u201d</p><p>My hand clenched so convulsively at this that the delicate handle of my teacup snapped clean off.</p><p>\u201cTaken?\u201d I croaked, my voice hoarse with shock. \u201cDid they hang him?\u201d</p><p>Fiona blinked at me in surprise. \u201cWhy, no,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to, my grannie said, and took him to trial for treason, but in the end, they shut him up in a prison instead\u2014but the gold went to his tenants, and so they lived through the famine,\u201d she ended cheerfully, obviously regarding this as the happy ending.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Roger breathed. He set his cup down carefully, and sat staring into space, transfixed. \u201cPrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like that\u2019s good,\u201d Brianna protested. The corners of her mouth were tight with distress, and her eyes slightly shiny.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Roger said, not noticing her distress. \u201cThere weren\u2019t that many prisons where the English imprisoned Jacobite traitors, and they all kept official records. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d he demanded, looking from Fiona\u2019s bewilderment to Brianna\u2019s scowl, then settling on me in hope of finding understanding. \u201cIf he went to prison, I can find him.\u201d He turned then, to look up at the towering shelves of books that lined three walls of the study, holding the late Reverend Wakefield\u2019s collection of Jacobite arcana.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in there,\u201d Roger said softly. \u201cOn a prison roll. In a document\u2014real evidence! Don\u2019t you see?\u201d he demanded again, turning back to me. \u201cGoing to prison made him a part of written history again! And somewhere in there, we\u2019ll find him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened to him then,\u201d Brianna breathed. \u201cWhen he was released.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s lips pressed tight together, to cut off the alternative that sprang to his mind, as it had to mine\u2014\u201cor died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right,\u201d he said, taking Brianna\u2019s hand. His eyes met mine, deep green and unfathomable. \u201cWhen he was released.\u201d</p><p>A week later, Roger\u2019s faith in documents remained unshaken. The same could not be said for the eighteenth-century table in the late Reverend Wakefield\u2019s study, whose spindly legs wobbled and creaked alarmingly beneath their unaccustomed burden.</p><p>This table normally was asked to accommodate no more than a small lamp, and a collection of the Reverend\u2019s smaller artifacts; it was pressed into service now only because every other horizontal surface in the study already overflowed with papers, journals, books, and bulging manila envelopes from antiquarian societies, universities, and research libraries across England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p><p>\u201cIf you set one more page on that thing, it\u2019s going to collapse,\u201d Claire observed, as Roger carelessly reached out, meaning to drop the folder he was carrying on the little inlaid table.</p><p>\u201cAh? Oh, right.\u201d He switched direction in midair, looked vainly for another place to put the folder, and finally settled for placing it on the floor at his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just about finished with Wentworth,\u201d Claire said. She indicated a precarious stack on the floor with her toe. \u201cHave we got in the records for Berwick yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, just this morning. Where did I put them, though?\u201d Roger stared vaguely about the room, which strongly resembled the sacking of the library at Alexandria, just before the first torch was lit. He rubbed his forehead, trying to concentrate. After a week of spending ten-hour days thumbing the handwritten registers of British prisons, and the letters, journals, and diaries of their governors, searching for any official trace of Jamie Fraser, Roger was beginning to feel as though his eyes had been sandpapered.</p><p>\u201cIt was blue,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI distinctly remember it was blue. I got those from McAllister, the History Lecturer at Trinity at Cambridge, and Trinity College uses those big envelopes in pale blue, with the college\u2019s coat of arms on the front. Maybe Fiona\u2019s seen it. Fiona!\u201d</p><p>He stepped to the study door and called down the hall toward the kitchen. Despite the lateness of the hour, the light was still on, and the heartening scent of cocoa and freshly baked almond cake lingered in the air. Fiona would never abandon her post while there was the faintest possibility that someone in her vicinity might require nourishment.</p><p>\u201cOch, aye?\u201d Fiona\u2019s curly brown head poked out of the kitchen. \u201cThere\u2019ll be cocoa ready directly,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI\u2019m only waiting for the cake to be out of the oven.\u201d</p><p>Roger smiled at her with deep affection. Fiona had not the slightest use herself for history\u2014never read anything beyond My Weekly magazine\u2014but she never questioned his activities, tranquilly dusting the heaps of books and papers daily, without bothering about their contents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Fiona,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only wondering, though; have you seen a big blue envelope\u2014a fat one, about so?\u201d He measured with his hands. \u201cIt came in the morning post, but I\u2019ve misplaced it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe left it in the upstairs bath,\u201d she said promptly. \u201cThere\u2019s that great thick book wi\u2019 the gold writing and the picture of the Bonnie Prince on the front up there, and three letters ye\u2019d just opened, and there\u2019s the gas bill, too, which ye dinna want to be forgetting, it\u2019s due on the fourteenth o\u2019 the month. I\u2019ve put it all on the top of the geyser, so as to be out of the way.\u201d A tiny, sharp ding from the oven timer made her withdraw her head abruptly with a smothered exclamation.</p><p>Roger turned and went up the stairs two at a time, smiling. Given other inclinations, Fiona\u2019s memory might have made her a scholar. As it was, she was no mean research assistant. So long as a particular document or book could be described on the basis of its appearance, rather than its title or contents, Fiona was bound to know exactly where it was.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d she had assured Roger airily, when he had tried to apologize earlier for the mess he was making of the house. \u201cYe\u2019d think the Reverend was still alive, wi\u2019 such a moil of papers strewn everywhere. It\u2019s just like old times, no?\u201d</p> <p>Coming down more slowly, with the blue envelope in his hands, he wondered what his late adoptive father might have thought of this present quest.</p><p>\u201cIn it up to the eyebrows, I shouldn\u2019t wonder,\u201d he murmured to himself. He had a vivid memory of the Reverend, bald head gleaming under the old-fashioned bowl lamps that hung from the hall ceiling, as he pottered from his study to the kitchen, where old Mrs. Graham, Fiona\u2019s grandmother, would have been manning the stove, supplying the old man\u2019s bodily needs during bouts of late-night scholarship, just as Fiona was now doing for him.</p><p>It made one wonder, he thought, as he went into the study. In the old days, when a man\u2019s son usually followed his father\u2019s profession, was that only a matter of convenience\u2014wanting to keep the business in the family\u2014or was there some sort of family predisposition for some kinds of work? Were some people actually born to be smiths, or merchants, or cooks\u2014born to an inclination and an aptitude, as well as to the opportunity?</p><p>Clearly it didn\u2019t apply to everyone; there were always the people who left their homes, went a-wandering, tried things hitherto unknown in their family circles. If that weren\u2019t so, probably there would be no inventors, no explorers; still, there seemed to be a certain affinity for some careers in some families, even in these restless modern times of widespread education and easy travel.</p><p>What he was really wondering about, he thought to himself, was Brianna. He watched Claire, her curly gold-shot head bent over the desk, and found himself wondering how much Brianna would be like her, and how much like the shadowy Scot\u2014warrior, farmer, courtier, laird\u2014who had been her father?</p> <p>His thoughts were still running on such lines a quarter-hour later, when Claire closed the last folder on her stack and sat back, sighing.</p><p>\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d she asked, reaching for her drink.</p><p>\u201cNot worth that much,\u201d Roger replied with a smile, coming out of his reverie. \u201cI was only wondering how people come to be what they are. How did you come to be a doctor, for instance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I come to be a doctor?\u201d Claire inhaled the steam from her cup of cocoa, decided it was too hot to drink, and set it back on the desk, among the litter of books and journals and pencil-scribbled sheets of paper. She gave Roger a half-smile and rubbed her hands together, dispersing the warmth of the cup.</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to be a historian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less honestly,\u201d he answered, leaning back in the Reverend\u2019s chair and waving at the accumulation of papers and trivia all around them. He patted a small gilt traveling clock that sat on the desk, an elegant bit of eighteenth-century workmanship, with miniature chimes that struck the hour, the quarter, and the half.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in the midst of it all; I was ferreting round the Highlands in search of artifacts with my father from the time I could read. I suppose it just seemed natural to keep doing it. But you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stretched, easing her shoulders from the long hours of stooping over the desk. Brianna, unable to stay awake, had given up and gone to bed an hour before, but Claire and Roger had gone on with their search through the administrative records of British prisons.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was something like that for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much that I suddenly decided I must become a doctor\u2014it was just that I suddenly realized one day that I\u2019d been one for a long time\u2014and then I wasn\u2019t, and I missed it.\u201d</p><p>She spread her hands out on the desk and flexed her fingers, long and supple, the nails buffed into neat, shiny ovals.</p><p>\u201cThere used to be an old song from the First World War,\u201d she said reflectively. \u201cI used to hear it sometimes when some of Uncle Lamb\u2019s old army friends would come round and stay up late and get drunk. It went, \u2018How You Gonna Keep \u2019em Down on the Farm, After They\u2019ve Seen Paree?\u2019\u201d She sang the first line, then broke off with a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d seen Paree,\u201d she said softly. She looked up from her hands, alert and present, but with the traces of memory in her eyes, fixed on Roger with the clarity of a second sight. \u201cAnd a lot of other things besides. Caen and Amiens, Preston, and Falkirk, the H\u00f4pital des Anges and the so-called surgery at Leoch. I\u2019d been a doctor, in every way there is\u2014I\u2019d delivered babies, set bones, stitched wounds, treated fevers...\u201d She trailed off, and shrugged. \u201cThere was a terrible lot I didn\u2019t know, of course. I knew how much I could learn\u2014and that\u2019s why I went to medical school. But it didn\u2019t really make a difference, you know.\u201d She dipped a finger into the whipped cream floating on her cocoa, and licked it off. \u201cI have a diploma with an M.D. on it\u2014but I was a doctor long before I set foot in medical school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t possibly have been as easy as you make it sound.\u201d Roger blew on his own cocoa, studying Claire with open interest. \u201cThere weren\u2019t many women in medicine then\u2014there aren\u2019t that many women doctors now, come to that\u2014and you had a family, besides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t say it was easy at all.\u201d Claire looked at him quizzically. \u201cI waited until Brianna was in school, of course, and we had enough money to afford someone to come in to cook and clean\u2014but...\u201d She shrugged and smiled ironically. \u201cI stopped sleeping for several years, there. That helped a bit. And oddly enough, Frank helped, too.\u201d</p> <p>Roger tested his own cup and found it almost cool enough to drink. He held it between his hands, enjoying the heat of the thick white porcelain seeping into his palms. Early June it might be, but the nights were cool enough to make the electric fire still a necessity.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said curiously. \u201cOnly from the things you\u2019ve said about him, I shouldn\u2019t have thought he\u2019d have liked your wanting to go to medical school or be a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d Her lips pressed tight together; the motion told Roger more than words might, recalling arguments, conversations half-finished and abandoned, an opposition of stubbornness and devious obstruction rather than of open disapproval.</p><p>What a remarkably expressive face she had, he thought, watching her. He wondered quite suddenly whether his own were as easily readable. The thought was so unsettling that he dipped his face into his mug, gulping the cocoa, although it was still a bit too hot.</p><p>He emerged from the cup to find Claire watching him, slightly sardonic.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked quickly, to distract her. \u201cWhat made him change his mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d she said, and her face softened as it always did at the mention of her daughter. \u201cBree was the only thing really important to Frank.\u201d</p><p>I had, as I\u2019d said, waited until Brianna began school before beginning medical school myself. But even so, there was a large gap between her hours and my own, which we filled haphazardly with a series of more or less competent housekeepers and baby-sitters; some more, most of them less.</p><p>My mind went back to the frightful day when I had gotten a call at the hospital, telling me that Brianna was hurt. I had dashed out of the place, not pausing to change out of the green linen scrub-suit I was wearing, and raced for home, ignoring all speed limits, to find a police car and an ambulance lighting the night with blood-red pulses, and a knot of interested neighbors clustered on the street outside.</p><p>As we pieced the story together later, what had happened was that the latest temporary sitter, annoyed at my being late yet again, had simply put on her coat at quitting time and left, abandoning seven-year-old Brianna with instructions to \u201cwait for Mommy.\u201d This she had obediently done, for an hour or so. But as it began to get dark, she had become frightened in the house alone, and determined to go out and find me. Making her way across one of the busy streets near our house, she had been struck by a car turning into the street.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t\u2014thank God!\u2014hurt badly; the car had been moving slowly, and she had only been shaken and bruised by the experience. Not nearly as shaken as I was, for that matter. Nor as bruised, when I came into the living room to find her lying on the sofa, and she looked at me, tears welling afresh on her stained cheeks and said, \u201cMommy! Where were you? I couldn\u2019t find you!\u201d</p><p>It had taken just about all my reserves of professional composure to comfort her, to check her over, re-tend her cuts and scrapes, thank her rescuers\u2014who, to my fevered mind, all glared accusingly at me\u2014and put her to bed with her teddy bear clutched securely in her arms. Then I sat down at the kitchen table and cried myself.</p><p>Frank patted me awkwardly, murmuring, but then gave it up, and with more practicality, went to make tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided,\u201d I said, when he set the steaming cup in front of me. I spoke dully, my head feeling thick and clogged. \u201cI\u2019ll resign. I\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResign?\u201d Frank\u2019s voice was sharp with astonishment. \u201cFrom the school? What for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d I never took cream or sugar in my tea. Now I added both, stirring and watching the milky tendrils swirl through the cup. \u201cI can\u2019t stand leaving Bree, and not knowing if she\u2019s well cared for\u2014and knowing she isn\u2019t happy. You know she doesn\u2019t really like any of the sitters we\u2019ve tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, yes.\u201d He sat opposite me, stirring his own tea. After a long moment, he said, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you should resign.\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing I had expected; I had thought he would greet my decision with relieved applause. I stared at him in astonishment, then blew my nose yet again on the wadded tissue from my pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Claire.\u201d He spoke impatiently, but with a tinge of affection nonetheless. \u201cYou\u2019ve known forever who you are. Do you realize at all how unusual it is to know that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I wiped my nose with the shredding tissue, dabbing carefully to keep it in one piece.</p><p>Frank leaned back in his chair, shaking his head as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not,\u201d he said. He was quiet for a minute, looking down at his folded hands. They were long-fingered, narrow; smooth and hairless as a girl\u2019s. Elegant hands, made for casual gestures and the emphasis of speech.</p><p>He stretched them out on the table and looked at them as though he\u2019d never seen them before.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got that,\u201d he said quietly at last. \u201cI\u2019m good, all right. At what I do\u2014the teaching, the writing. Bloody splendid sometimes, in fact. And I like it a good bit, enjoy what I do. But the thing is\u2014\u201d He hesitated, then looked at me straight on, hazel-eyed and earnest. \u201cI could do something else, and be as good. Care as much, or as little. I haven\u2019t got that absolute conviction that there\u2019s something in life I\u2019m meant to do\u2014and you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that good?\u201d The edges of my nostrils were sore, and my eyes puffed from crying.</p><p>He laughed shortly. \u201cIt\u2019s damned inconvenient, Claire. To you and me and Bree, all three. But my God, I do envy you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He reached out for my hand, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, I let him have it.</p><p>\u201cTo have that passion for anything\u201d\u2014a small twitch tugged the corner of his mouth\u2014\u201cor anyone. That\u2019s quite splendid, Claire, and quite terribly rare.\u201d He squeezed my hand gently and let it go, turning to reach behind him for one of the books on the shelf beside the table.</p> <p>It was one of his references, Woodhill\u2019s Patriots, a series of profiles of the American Founding Fathers.</p><p>He laid his hand on the cover of the book, gently, as though reluctant to disturb the rest of the sleeping lives interred there.</p><p>\u201cThese were people like that. The ones who cared so terribly much\u2014enough to risk everything, enough to change and do things. Most people aren\u2019t like that, you know. It isn\u2019t that they don\u2019t care, but that they don\u2019t care so greatly.\u201d He took my hand again, this time turning it over. One finger traced the lines that webbed my palm, tickling as it went.</p><p>\u201cIs it there, I wonder?\u201d he said, smiling a little. \u201cAre some people destined for a great fate, or to do great things? Or is it only that they\u2019re born somehow with that great passion\u2014and if they find themselves in the right circumstances, then things happen? It\u2019s the sort of thing you wonder, studying history...but there\u2019s no way of telling, really. All we know is what they accomplished.</p><p>\u201cBut Claire\u2014\u201d His eyes held a definite note of warning, as he tapped the cover of his book. \u201cThey paid for it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I felt very remote now, as though I were watching us from a distance; I could see it quite clearly in my mind\u2019s eye; Frank, handsome, lean, and a little tired, going beautifully gray at the temples. Me, grubby in my surgical scrubs, my hair coming down, the front of my shirt crumpled and stained with Brianna\u2019s tears.</p> <p>We sat in silence for some time, my hand still resting in Frank\u2019s. I could see the mysterious lines and valleys, clear as a road map\u2014but a road to what unknown destination?</p><p>I had had my palm read once years before, by an old Scottish lady named Graham\u2014Fiona\u2019s grandmother, in fact. \u201cThe lines in your hand change as you change,\u201d she had said. \u201cIt\u2019s no so much what you\u2019re born with, as what ye make of yourself.\u201d</p><p>And what had I made of myself, what was I making? A mess, that was what. Neither a good mother, nor a good wife, nor a good doctor. A mess. Once I had thought I was whole\u2014had seemed to be able to love a man, to bear a child, to heal the sick\u2014and know that all these things were natural parts of me, not the difficult, troubled fragments into which my life had now disintegrated. But that had been in the past, the man I had loved was Jamie, and for a time, I had been part of something greater than myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Bree.\u201d</p><p>I was so deep in miserable thought that for a moment, Frank\u2019s words didn\u2019t register, and I stared at him stupidly.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d he repeated patiently, \u201cthat I\u2019ll take Bree. She can come from her school to the university, and play at my office until I\u2019m ready to come home.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my nose. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t think it appropriate for staff to bring their children to work.\u201d He had been quite critical of Mrs. Clancy, one of the secretaries, who had brought her grandson to work for a month when his mother was sick.</p> <p>He shrugged, looking uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWell, circumstances alter cases. And Brianna\u2019s not likely to be running up and down the halls shrieking and spilling ink like Bart Clancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet my life on it,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cBut you\u2019d do that?\u201d A small feeling was growing in the pit of my clenched stomach; a cautious, unbelieving feeling of relief. I might not trust Frank to be faithful to me\u2014I knew quite well he wasn\u2019t\u2014but I did trust him unequivocally to care for Bree.</p><p>Suddenly the worry was removed. I needn\u2019t hurry home from the hospital, filled with dread because I was late, hating the thought of finding Brianna crouched in her room sulking because she didn\u2019t like the current sitter. She loved Frank; I knew she would be ecstatic at the thought of going to his office every day.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked bluntly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that you\u2019re dead keen on my being a doctor; I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that. But I do think there isn\u2019t any way to stop you\u2014perhaps the best I can do is to help, so that there will be less damage to Brianna.\u201d His features hardened slightly then, and he turned away.</p><p>\u201cSo far as he ever felt he had a destiny\u2014something he was really meant to do\u2014he felt that Brianna was it,\u201d Claire said. She stirred her cocoa meditatively.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care, Roger?\u201d she asked him suddenly. \u201cWhy are you asking me?\u201d</p><p>He took a moment to answer, slowly sipping his cocoa. It was rich and dark, made with new cream and a sprinkle of brown sugar. Fiona, always a realist, had taken one look at Brianna and given up her attempts to lure Roger into matrimony via his stomach, but Fiona was a cook the same way Claire was a doctor; born to skill, and unable not to use it.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a historian, I suppose,\u201d he answered finally. He watched her over the rim of his cup. \u201cI need to know. What people really did, and why they did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can tell you that?\u201d She glanced sharply at him. \u201cOr that I know?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, sipping. \u201cYou know, better than most people. Most of a historian\u2019s sources haven\u2019t your\u201d\u2014he paused and gave her a grin\u2014\u201cyour unique perspective, shall we say?\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden lessening of tension. She laughed and picked up her own cup. \u201cWe shall say that,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe other thing,\u201d he went on, watching her closely, \u201cis that you\u2019re honest. I don\u2019t think you could lie, even if you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him sharply, and gave a short, dry laugh.</p><p>\u201cEveryone can lie, young Roger, given cause enough. Even me. It\u2019s only that it\u2019s harder for those of us who live in glass faces; we have to think up our lies ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head and shuffled through the papers before her, turning the pages over slowly, one by one. They were lists of names, these sheets, lists of prisoners, copied from the ledger books of British prisons. The task was complicated by the fact that not all prisons had been well-run.</p><p>Some governors kept no official lists of their inmates, or listed them haphazardly in their journals, in among the notations of daily expenditure and maintenance, making no great distinction between the death of a prisoner and the slaughter of two bullocks, salted for meat.</p><p>Roger thought Claire had abandoned the conversation, but a moment later she looked up again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite right, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m honest\u2014from default, more than anything. It isn\u2019t easy for me not to say what I\u2019m thinking. I imagine you see it because you\u2019re the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d Roger felt absurdly pleased, as though someone had given him an unexpected present.</p><p>Claire nodded, a small smile on her lips as she watched him.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. It\u2019s unmistakable, you know. There aren\u2019t many people like that\u2014who will tell you the truth about themselves and anything else right out. I\u2019ve only met three people like that, I think\u2014four now,\u201d she said, her smile widening to warm him.</p><p>\u201cThere was Jamie, of course.\u201d Her long fingers rested lightly on the stack of papers, almost caressing in their touch. \u201cMaster Raymond, the apothecary I knew in Paris. And a friend I met in medical school\u2014Joe Abernathy. Now you. I think.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her cup and swallowed the last of the rich brown liquid. She set it down and looked directly at Roger.</p><p>\u201cFrank was right, in a way, though. It isn\u2019t necessarily easier if you know what it is you\u2019re meant to do\u2014but at least you don\u2019t waste time in questioning or doubting. If you\u2019re honest\u2014well, that isn\u2019t necessarily easier, either. Though I suppose if you\u2019re honest with yourself and know what you are, at least you\u2019re less likely to feel that you\u2019ve wasted your life, doing the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>She set aside the stack of papers and drew up another\u2014a set of folders with the characteristic logo of the British Museum on the covers.</p><p>\u201cJamie had that,\u201d she said softly, as though to herself. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a man to turn away from anything he thought his job. Dangerous or not. And I think he won\u2019t have felt himself wasted\u2014no matter what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>She lapsed into silence, then, absorbed in the spidery tracings of some long-dead writer, looking for the entry that might tell her what Jamie Fraser had done and been, and whether his life had been wasted in a prison cell, or ended in a lonely dungeon.</p><p>The clock on the desk struck midnight, its chimes surprisingly deep and melodious for such a small instrument. The quarter-hour struck, and then the half, punctuating the monotonous rustle of pages. Roger put down the sheaf of flimsy papers he had been thumbing through, and yawned deeply, not troubling to cover his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired I\u2019m seeing double,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we go on with it in the morning?\u201d</p><p>Claire didn\u2019t answer for a moment; she was looking into the glowing bars of the electric fire, a look of unutterable distance on her face. Roger repeated his question, and slowly she came back from wherever she was.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. She reached for another folder, and smiled at Roger, the look of distance lingering in her eyes. \u201cYou go on, Roger,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014just look a little longer.\u201d</p><p>When I finally found it, I nearly flipped right past it. I had not been reading the names carefully, but only skimming the pages for the letter \u201cJ.\u201d \u201cJohn, Joseph, Jacques, James.\u201d There were James Edward, James Alan, James Walter, ad infinitum. Then it was there, the writing small and precise across the page: \u201cJms. MacKenzie Fraser, of Brock Turac.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I put the page down carefully on the table, shut my eyes for a moment to clear them, then looked again. It was still there.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said aloud. My heart was beating heavily in my chest. \u201cJamie,\u201d I said again, more quietly.</p><p>It was nearly three o\u2019clock in the morning. Everyone was asleep, but the house, in the manner of old houses, was still awake around me, creaking and sighing, keeping me company. Strangely enough, I had no desire to leap up and wake Brianna or Roger, to tell them the news. I wanted to keep it to myself for a bit, as though I were alone here in the lamp-lit room with Jamie himself.</p><p>My finger traced the line of ink. The person who had written that line had seen Jamie\u2014perhaps had written this with Jamie standing in front of him. The date at the top of the page was May 16, 1753. It had been close to this time of year, then. I could imagine how the air had been, chilly and fresh, with the rare spring sun across his shoulders, lighting sparks in his hair.</p> <p>How had he worn his hair then\u2014short, or long? He had preferred to wear it long, plaited or tailed behind. I remembered the casual gesture with which he would lift the weight of it off his neck to cool himself in the heat of exercise.</p><p>He would not have worn his kilt\u2014the wearing of all tartans had been outlawed after Culloden. Breeks, then, likely, and a linen shirt. I had made such sarks for him; I could feel the softness of the fabric in memory, the billowing length of the three full yards it took to make one, the long tails and full sleeves that let the Highland men drop their plaids and sleep or fight with a sark their only garment. I could imagine his shoulders broad beneath the rough-woven cloth, his skin warm through it, hands touched with the chill of the Scottish spring.</p><p>He had been imprisoned before. How would he have looked, facing an English prison clerk, knowing all too well what waited for him? Grim as hell, I thought, staring down that long, straight nose with his eyes a cold, dark blue\u2014dark and forbidding as the waters of Loch Ness.</p><p>I opened my own eyes, realizing only then that I was sitting on the edge of my chair, the folder of photocopied pages clasped tight to my chest, so caught up in my conjuration that I had not even paid attention to which prison these registers had come from.</p><p>There were several large prisons that the English had used regularly in the eighteenth century, and a number of minor ones. I turned the folder over, slowly. Would it be Berwick, near the border? The notorious Tolbooth of Edinburgh? Or one of the southern prisons, Leeds Castle or even the Tower of London?</p> <p>\u201cArdsmuir,\u201d said the notecard neatly stapled to the front of the folder.</p><p>\u201cArdsmuir?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cWhere the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>HONOR\u2019S PRISONER</p><p>Ardsmuir, Scotland</p><p>February 15, 1755</p> <p>\u201cArdsmuir is the carbuncle on God\u2019s bum,\u201d Colonel Harry Quarry said. He raised his glass sardonically to the young man by the window. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a twelvemonth, and that\u2019s eleven months and twenty-nine days too long. Give you joy of your new posting, my Lord.\u201d</p><p>Major John William Grey turned from the window over the courtyard, where he had been surveying his new domain.</p><p>\u201cIt does appear a trifle incommodious,\u201d he agreed dryly, picking up his own glass. \u201cDoes it rain all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s Scotland\u2014and the backside of bloody Scotland, at that.\u201d Quarry took a deep pull at his whisky, coughed, and exhaled noisily as he set down the empty glass.</p><p>\u201cThe drink is the only compensation,\u201d he said, a trifle hoarsely. \u201cCall on the local booze-merchants in your best uniform, and they\u2019ll make you a decent price. It\u2019s astounding cheap, without the tariff. I\u2019ve left you a note of the best stills.\u201d He nodded toward the massive oaken desk at the side of the room, planted four-square on its island of carpet like a small fortress confronting the barren room. The illusion of fortifications was enhanced by the banners of regiment and nation that hung from the stone wall behind it.</p><p>\u201cThe guards\u2019 roster is here,\u201d Quarry said, rising and groping in the top desk drawer. He slapped a battered leather folder on the desktop, and added another on top of that. \u201cAnd the prisoners\u2019 roll. You have one hundred and ninety-six at the moment; two hundred is the usual count, give or take a few deaths from sickness or the odd poacher taken up in the countryside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred,\u201d Grey said. \u201cAnd how many in the guards\u2019 barracks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty-two, by number. In use, about half that.\u201d Quarry reached into the drawer again and withdrew a brown glass bottle with a cork. He shook it, heard it slosh, and smiled sardonically. \u201cThe commander isn\u2019t the only one to find consolation in drink. Half the sots are usually incapable at roll call. I\u2019ll leave this for you, shall I? You\u2019ll need it.\u201d He put the bottle back and pulled out the lower drawer.</p> <p>\u201cRequisitions and copies here; the paperwork\u2019s the worst of the post. Not a great deal to do, really, if you\u2019ve a decent clerk. You haven\u2019t, at the moment; I had a corporal who wrote a fairish hand, but he died two weeks ago. Train up another, and you\u2019ll have nothing to do save to hunt for grouse and the Frenchman\u2019s Gold.\u201d He laughed at his own joke; rumors of the gold that Louis of France had supposedly sent to his cousin Charles Stuart were rife in this end of Scotland.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoners are not difficult?\u201d Grey asked. \u201cI had understood them to be mostly Jacobite Highlanders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. But they\u2019re docile enough.\u201d Quarry paused, looking out of the window. A small line of ragged men was issuing from a door in the forbidding stone wall opposite. \u201cNo heart in them after Culloden,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cButcher Billy saw to that. And we work them hard enough that they\u2019ve no vigor left for troublemaking.\u201d</p><p>Grey nodded. Ardsmuir fortress was undergoing renovation, rather ironically using the labor of the Scots incarcerated therein. He rose and came to join Quarry at the window.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a work crew going out now, for peat-cutting.\u201d Quarry nodded at the group below. A dozen bearded men, ragged as scarecrows, formed an awkward line before a red-coated soldier, who walked up and down, inspecting them. Evidently satisfied, he shouted an order and jerked a hand toward the outer gate.</p><p>The prisoners\u2019 crew was accompanied by six armed soldiers, who fell in before and behind, muskets held in marching order, their smart appearance a marked contrast to the ragged Highlanders. The prisoners walked slowly, oblivious to the rain that soaked their rags. A mule-drawn wagon creaked behind, a bundle of peat knives gleaming dully in its bed.</p><p>Quarry frowned, counting them. \u201cSome must be ill; a work crew is eighteen men\u2014three prisoners to a guard, because of the knives. Though surprisingly few of them try to run,\u201d he added, turning away from the window. \u201cNowhere to go, I suppose.\u201d He left the desk, kicking aside a large woven basket that sat on the hearth, filled with crude chunks of a rough dark-brown substance.</p><p>\u201cLeave the window open, even when it\u2019s raining,\u201d he advised. \u201cThe peat smoke will choke you, otherwise.\u201d He took a deep breath in illustration and let it out explosively. \u201cGod, I\u2019ll be glad to get back to London!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much in the way of local society, I collect?\u201d Grey asked dryly. Quarry laughed, his broad red face creasing in amusement at the notion.</p><p>\u201cSociety? My dear fellow! Bar one or two passable blowzabellas down in the village, \u2018society\u2019 will consist solely of conversation with your officers\u2014there are four of them, one of whom is capable of speaking without the use of profanity\u2014your orderly, and one prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prisoner?\u201d Grey looked up from the ledgers he had been perusing, one fair brow lifted in inquiry.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Quarry was prowling the office restlessly, eager to be off. His carriage was waiting; he had stayed only to brief his replacement and make the formal handover of command. Now he paused, glancing at Grey. One corner of his mouth curled up, enjoying a secret joke.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of Red Jamie Fraser, I expect?\u201d</p><p>Grey stiffened slightly, but kept his face as unmoved as possible.</p><p>\u201cI should imagine most people have,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cThe man was notorious during the Rising.\u201d Quarry had heard the story, damn him! All of it, or only the first part?</p><p>Quarry\u2019s mouth twitched slightly, but he merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cQuite. Well, we have him. He\u2019s the only senior Jacobite officer here; the Highlander prisoners treat him as their chief. Consequently, if any matters arise involving the prisoners\u2014and they will, I assure you\u2014he acts as their spokesman.\u201d Quarry was in his stockinged feet; now he sat and tugged on long cavalry boots, in preparation for the mud outside.</p><p>\u201cSeumas, mac an fhear dhuibh, they call him, or just Mac Dubh. Speak Gaelic, do you? Neither do I\u2014Grissom does, though; he says it means \u2018James, son of the Black One.\u2019 Half the guards are afraid of him\u2014those that fought with Cope at Prestonpans. Say he\u2019s the Devil himself. Poor devil, now!\u201d Quarry gave a brief snort, forcing his foot into the boot. He stamped once, to settle it, and stood up.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoners obey him without question; but give orders without his putting his seal to them, and you might as well be talking to the stones in the courtyard. Ever had much to do with Scots? Oh, of course; you fought at Culloden with your brother\u2019s regiment, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Quarry struck his brow at his pretended forgetfulness. Damn the man! He had heard it all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have an idea, then. Stubborn does not begin to describe it.\u201d He flapped a hand in the air as though to dismiss an entire contingent of recalcitrant Scots.</p><p>\u201cWhich means,\u201d Quarry paused, enjoying it, \u201cyou\u2019ll need Fraser\u2019s good-will\u2014or at least his cooperation. I had him take supper with me once a week, to talk things over, and found it answered very well. You might try the same arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I might.\u201d Grey\u2019s tone was cool, but his hands were clenched tight at his sides. When icicles grew in hell, he might take supper with James Fraser!</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an educated man,\u201d Quarry continued, eyes bright with malice, fixed on Grey\u2019s face. \u201cA great deal more interesting to talk to than the officers. Plays chess. You have a game now and then, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and then.\u201d The muscles of his abdomen were clenched so tightly that he had trouble drawing breath. Would this bullet-headed fool not stop talking and leave?</p><p>\u201cAh, well, I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d As though divining Grey\u2019s wish, Quarry settled his wig more firmly, then took his cloak from the hook by the door and swirled it rakishly about his shoulders. He turned toward the door, hat in hand, then turned back.</p><p>\u201cOh, one thing. If you do dine with Fraser alone\u2014don\u2019t turn your back on him.\u201d The offensive jocularity had left Quarry\u2019s face; Grey scowled at him, but could see no evidence that the warning was meant as a joke.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Quarry said, suddenly serious. \u201cHe\u2019s in irons, but it\u2019s easy to choke a man with the chain. And he\u2019s a very large fellow, Fraser.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d To his fury, Grey could feel the blood rising in his cheeks. To hide it, he swung about, letting the cold air from the half-open window play on his countenance. \u201cSurely,\u201d he said, to the rain-slick gray stones below, \u201cif he is the intelligent man you say, he would not be so foolish as to attack me in my own quarters, in the midst of the prison? What would be the purpose in it?\u201d</p><p>Quarry didn\u2019t answer. After a moment, Grey turned around, to find the other staring at him thoughtfully, all trace of humor gone from the broad, ruddy face.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s intelligence,\u201d Quarry said slowly. \u201cAnd then there are other things. But perhaps you\u2019re too young to have seen hate and despair at close range. There\u2019s been a deal of it in Scotland, these last ten years.\u201d He tilted his head, surveying the new commander of Ardsmuir from his vantage point of fifteen years\u2019 seniority.</p><p>Major Grey was young, no more than twenty-six, and with a fair-complexioned face and girlish lashes that made him look still younger than his years. To compound the problem, he was an inch or two shorter than the average, and fine-boned, as well. He drew himself up straight.</p> <p>\u201cI am aware of such things, Colonel,\u201d he said evenly. Quarry was a younger son of good family, like himself, but still his superior in rank; he must keep his temper.</p><p>Quarry\u2019s bright hazel gaze rested on him in speculation.</p><p>\u201cI daresay.\u201d</p><p>With a sudden motion, he clapped his hat on his head. He touched his cheek, where the darker line of a scar sliced across the ruddy skin; a memento of the scandalous duel that had sent him into exile at Ardsmuir.</p><p>\u201cGod knows what you did to be sent here, Grey,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cBut for your own sake, I hope you deserved it! Luck to you!\u201d And with a swirl of blue cloak, he was gone.</p> <p>\u201cBetter the Devil ye ken, than the Devil ye don\u2019t,\u201d Murdo Lindsay said, shaking his head lugubriously. \u201cHandsome Harry was nain sae bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wasna, then,\u201d agreed Kenny Lesley. \u201cBut ye\u2019ll ha\u2019 been here when he came, no? He was a deal better than that shite-face Bogle, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said Murdo, looking blank. \u201cWhat\u2019s your meaning, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if Handsome was better than Bogle,\u201d Lesley explained patiently, \u201cthen Handsome was the Devil we didna ken, and Bogle the one that we did\u2014but Handsome was better, in spite of that, so you\u2019re wrong, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d Murdo, hopelessly confused by this bit of reasoning, glowered at Lesley. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe are, then,\u201d Lesley said, losing patience. \u201cYe\u2019re always wrong, Murdo! Why d\u2019ye argue, when ye\u2019re never in the right of it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m no arguin\u2019!\u201d Murdo protested indignantly. \u201cYe\u2019re takin\u2019 exception to me, not t\u2019other way aboot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you\u2019re wrong, man!\u201d Lesley said. \u201cIf ye were right, I\u2019d have said not a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wrong! At least I dinna think so,\u201d Murdo muttered, unable to recall precisely what he had said. He turned, appealing to the large figure seated in the corner. \u201cMac Dubh, was I wrong?\u201d</p><p>The tall man stretched himself, the chain of his irons chiming faintly as he moved, and laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, Murdo, ye\u2019re no wrong. But we canna say if ye\u2019re right yet awhile. Not \u2019til we see what the new Devil\u2019s like, aye?\u201d Seeing Lesley\u2019s brows draw down in preparation for further dispute, he raised his voice, speaking to the room at large. \u201cHas anyone seen the new Governor yet? Johnson? MacTavish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Hayes said, pushing gladly forward to warm his hands at the fire. There was only one hearth in the large cell, and room for no more than six men before it at a time. The other forty were left in bitter chill, huddling together in small groups for warmth.</p><p>Consequently, the agreement was that whoever had a tale to tell or a song to sing might have a place by the hearth, for as long as he spoke. Mac Dubh had said this was a bard-right, that when the bards came to the auld castles, they would be given a warm place and plenty to eat and drink, to the honor of the laird\u2019s hospitality. There was never food or drink to spare here, but the warm place was certain.</p><p>Hayes relaxed, eyes closed and a beatific smile on his face as he spread his hands to the warmth. Warned by restive movement to either side, though, he hastily opened his eyes and began to speak.</p> <p>\u201cI saw him when he came in from his carriage, and then again, when I brought up a platter o\u2019 sweeties from the kitchens, whilst he and Handsome Harry were nattering to ain another.\u201d Hayes frowned in concentration.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fair-haired, wi\u2019 long yellow locks tied up wi\u2019 blue ribbon. And big eyes and long lashes, too, like a lassie\u2019s.\u201d Hayes leered at his listeners, batting his own stubby lashes in mock flirtation.</p><p>Encouraged by the laughter, he went on to describe the new Governor\u2019s clothes\u2014\u201cfine as a laird\u2019s\u201d\u2014his equipage and servant\u2014\u201cone of they Sassenachs as talks like he\u2019s burnt his tongue\u201d\u2014and as much as had been overheard of the new man\u2019s speech.</p><p>\u201cHe talks sharp and quick, like he\u2019ll know what\u2019s what,\u201d Hayes said, shaking his head dubiously. \u201cBut he\u2019s verra young, forbye\u2014he looks scarce more than a wean, though I\u2019d reckon he\u2019s older than his looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019s a bittie fellow, smaller than wee Angus,\u201d Baird chimed in, with a jerk of the head at Angus MacKenzie, who looked down at himself in startlement. Angus had been twelve when he fought beside his father at Culloden. He had spent nearly half his life in Ardsmuir, and in consequence of the poor fare of prison, had never grown much bigger.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Hayes agreed, \u201cbut he carries himself well; shoulders square and a ramrod up his arse.\u201d</p><p>This gave rise to a burst of laughter and ribald comment, and Hayes gave way to Ogilvie, who knew a long and scurrilous story about the laird of Donibristle and the hogman\u2019s daughter. Hayes left the hearth without resentment, and went\u2014as was the custom\u2014to sit beside Mac Dubh.</p><p>Mac Dubh never took his place on the hearth, even when he told them the long stories from the books that he\u2019d read\u2014The Adventures of Roderick Random, The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, or everyone\u2019s favorite, Robinson Crusoe. Claiming that he needed the room to accommodate his long legs, Mac Dubh sat always in his same spot in the corner, where everyone might hear him. But the men who left the fire would come, one by one, and sit down on the bench beside him, to give him the warmth that lingered in their clothes.</p><p>\u201cShall ye speak to the new Governor tomorrow, d\u2019ye think, Mac Dubh?\u201d Hayes asked as he sat. \u201cI met Billy Malcolm, coming in from the peat-cutting, and he shouted to me as the rats were grown uncommon bold in their cell just now. Six men bitten this sennight as they slept, and two of them festering.\u201d</p><p>Mac Dubh shook his head, and scratched at his chin. He had been allowed a razor before his weekly audiences with Harry Quarry, but it had been five days since the last of these, and his chin was thick with red stubble.</p><p>\u201cI canna say, Gavin,\u201d he said. \u201cQuarry did say as he\u2019d tell the new fellow of our arrangement, but the new man might have his own ways, aye? If I\u2019m called to see him, though, I shall be sure to say about the rats. Did Malcolm ask for Morrison to come and see to the festering, though?\u201d The prison had no doctor; Morrison, who had a touch for healing, was permitted by the guards to go from cell to cell to tend the sick or injured, at Mac Dubh\u2019s request.</p><p>Hayes shook his head. \u201cHe hadna time to say more\u2014they were marching past, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest I send Morrison,\u201d Mac Dubh decided. \u201cHe can ask Billy is there aught else amiss there.\u201d There were four main cells where the prisoners were kept in large groups; word passed among them by means of Morrison\u2019s visits and the mingling of men on the work crews that went out daily to haul stone or cut peats on the nearby moor.</p><p>Morrison came at once when summoned, pocketing four of the carved rats\u2019 skulls with which the prisoners improvised games of draughts. Mac Dubh groped under the bench where he sat, drawing out the cloth bag he carried when he went to the moor.</p><p>\u201cOch, not more o\u2019 the damn thistles,\u201d Morrison protested, seeing Mac Dubh\u2019s grimace as he groped in the bag. \u201cI canna make them eat those things; they all say, do I think them kine, or maybe pigs?\u201d</p><p>Mac Dubh gingerly set down a fistful of wilted stalks, and sucked his pricked fingers.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re stubborn as pigs, to be sure,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s only milk thistle. How often must I tell ye, Morrison? Take the thistle heads off, and mash the leaves and stems fine, and if they\u2019re too prickly to eat spread on a bannock, then make a tea of them and have them drink it. I\u2019ve yet to see pigs drink tea, tell them.\u201d</p><p>Morrison\u2019s lined face cracked in a grin. An elderly man, he knew well enough how to handle recalcitrant patients; he only liked to complain for the fun of it.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I\u2019ll say have they ever seen a toothless cow?\u201d he said, resigned, as he tucked the limp greens carefully into his own sack. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be sure to bare your teeth at Joel McCulloch, next time ye see him. He\u2019s the worst o\u2019 them, for not believin\u2019 as the greens do help wi\u2019 the scurvy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay as I\u2019ll bite him in the arse,\u201d Mac Dubh promised, with a flash of his excellent teeth, \u201cif I hear he hasna eaten his thistles.\u201d</p><p>Morrison made the small amused noise that passed for a belly laugh with him, and went to gather up the bits of ointment and the few herbs he had for medicines.</p><p>Mac Dubh relaxed for the moment, glancing about the room to be sure no trouble brewed. There were feuds at the moment; he\u2019d settled Bobby Sinclair and Edwin Murray\u2019s trouble a week back, and while they were not friends, they were keeping their distance from one another.</p><p>He closed his eyes. He was tired; he had been hauling stone all day. Supper would be along in a few minutes\u2014a tub of parritch and some bread to be shared out, a bit of brose too if they were lucky\u2014and likely most of the men would go to sleep soon after, leaving him a few minutes of peace and semiprivacy, when he need not listen to anyone or feel he must do anything.</p><p>He had had no time as yet even to wonder about the new Governor, important as the man would be to all their lives. Young, Hayes had said. That might be good, or might be bad.</p><p>Older men who had fought in the Rising were often prejudiced against Highlanders\u2014Bogle, who had put him in irons, had fought with Cope. A scared young soldier, though, trying to keep abreast of an unfamiliar job, could be more rigid and tyrannical than the crustiest of old colonels. Aye well, and nothing to be done but wait to see.</p><p>He sighed and shifted his posture, incommoded\u2014for the ten-thousandth time\u2014by the manacles he wore. He shifted irritably, banging one wrist against the edge of the bench. He was large enough that the weight of the irons didn\u2019t trouble him overmuch, but they chafed badly with the work. Worse was the inability to spread his arms more than eighteen inches apart; this gave him cramp and a clawing feeling, deep in the muscle of chest and back, that left him only when he slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMac Dubh,\u201d said a soft voice beside him. \u201cA word in your ear, if I might?\u201d He opened his eyes to see Ronnie Sutherland perched alongside, pointed face intent and foxlike in the faint glow from the fire.</p><p>\u201cAye, Ronnie, of course.\u201d He pushed himself upright, and put both his irons and the thought of the new Governor firmly from his mind.</p><p>Dearest mother, John Grey wrote, later that night.</p><p>I am arrived safely at my new post, and find it comfortable. Colonel Quarry, my predecessor\u2014he is the Duke of Clarence\u2019s nephew, you recall?\u2014made me welcome and acquainted with my charge. I am provided with a most excellent servant, and while I am bound to find many things about Scotland strange at first, I am sure I will find the experience interesting. I was served an object for my supper which the steward told me was called a \u201chaggis.\u201d Upon inquiry, this proved to be the interior organ of a sheep, filled with a mixture of ground oats and a quantity of unidentifiable cooked flesh. Though I am assured the inhabitants of Scotland esteem this dish a particular delicacy, I sent it to the kitchens and requested a plain boiled saddle of mutton in its place. Having thus made my first\u2014humble!\u2014meal here, and being somewhat fatigued by the long journey\u2014of whose details I shall inform you in a subsequent missive\u2014I believe I shall now retire, leaving further descriptions of my surroundings\u2014with which I am imperfectly acquainted at present, as it is dark\u2014for a future communication.</p> <p>He paused, tapping the quill on the blotter. The point left small dots of ink, and he abstractedly drew lines connecting these, making the outlines of a jagged object.</p><p>Dared he ask about George? Not a direct inquiry, that wouldn\u2019t do, but a reference to the family, asking whether his mother had happened to encounter Lady Everett lately, and might he ask to be remembered to her son?</p><p>He sighed and drew another point on his object. No. His widowed mother was ignorant of the situation, but Lady Everett\u2019s husband moved in military circles. His brother\u2019s influence would keep the gossip to a minimum, but Lord Everett might catch a whiff of it, nonetheless, and be quick enough to put two and two together. Let him drop an injudicious word to his wife about George, and the word pass on from Lady Everett to his mother...the Dowager Countess Melton was not a fool.</p><p>She knew quite well that he was in disgrace; promising young officers in the good graces of their superiors were not sent to the arse-end of Scotland to oversee the renovation of small and unimportant prison-fortresses. But his brother Harold had told her that the trouble was an unfortunate affair of the heart, implying sufficient indelicacy to stop her questioning him about it. She likely thought he had been caught with his colonel\u2019s wife, or keeping a whore in his quarters.</p><p>An unfortunate affair of the heart! He smiled grimly, dipping his pen. Perhaps Hal had a greater sensitivity than he\u2019d thought, in so describing it. But then, all his affairs had been unfortunate, since Hector\u2019s death at Culloden.</p> <p>With the thought of Culloden, the thought of Fraser came back to him; something he had been avoiding all day. He looked from the blotter to the folder which held the prisoners\u2019 roll, biting his lip. He was tempted to open it, and look to see the name, but what point was there in that? There might be scores of men in the Highlands named James Fraser, but only one known also as Red Jamie.</p><p>He felt himself flush as waves of heat rolled over him, but it was not nearness to the fire. In spite of that, he rose and went to the window, drawing in great lungfuls of air as though the cold draft could cleanse him of memory.</p><p>\u201cPardon, sir, but will ye be wantin\u2019 your bed warmed now?\u201d The Scottish speech behind him startled him, and he whirled round to find the tousled head of the prisoner assigned to tend his quarters poking through the door that led to his private rooms.</p><p>\u201cOh! Er, yes. Thank you...MacDonell?\u201d he said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cMacKay, my lord,\u201d the man corrected, without apparent resentment, and the head vanished.</p><p>Grey sighed. There was nothing that could be done tonight. He came back to the desk and gathered up the folders, to put them away. The jagged object he had drawn on the blotter looked like one of those spiked maces, with which ancient knights had crushed the heads of their foes. He felt as though he had swallowed one, though perhaps this was no more than indigestion occasioned by half-cooked mutton.</p> <p>He shook his head, pulled the letter to him and signed it hastily.</p><p>With all affection, your obt. son, John Wm. Grey. He shook sand over the signature, sealed the missive with his ring and set it aside to be posted in the morning.</p><p>He rose and stood hesitating, surveying the shadowy reaches of the office. It was a great, cold, barren room, with little in it bar the huge desk and a couple of chairs. He shivered; the sullen glow of the peat bricks on the hearth did little to warm its vast spaces, particularly with the freezing wet air coming in at the window.</p><p>He glanced once more at the prisoners\u2019 roll. Then he bent, opened the lower drawer of the desk, and drew out the brown glass bottle. He pinched out the candle, and made his way toward his bed by the dull glow of the hearth.</p><p>The mingled effects of exhaustion and whisky should have sent him to sleep at once, but sleep kept its distance, hovering over his bed like a bat, but never lighting. Every time he felt himself sinking into dreams, a vision of the wood at Carryarrick came before his eyes, and he found himself lying once more wide-awake and sweating, his heart thundering in his ears.</p><p>He had been sixteen then, excited beyond bearing by his first campaign. He had not got his commission then, but his brother Hal had taken him along with the regiment, so that he might get a taste of soldiering.</p><p>Camped at night near a dark Scottish wood, on their way to join General Cope at Prestonpans, John had found himself too nervous to sleep. What would the battle be like? Cope was a great general, all Hal\u2019s friends said so, but the men around the fires told frightful stories of the fierce Highlanders and their bloody broadswords. Would he have the courage to face the dreadful Highland charge?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bring himself to mention his fears even to Hector. Hector loved him, but Hector was twenty, tall and muscular and fearless, with a lieutenant\u2019s commission and dashing stories of battles fought in France.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t know, even now, whether it had been an urge to emulate Hector, or merely to impress him, that had led him to do it. In either case, when he saw the Highlander in the wood, and recognized him from the broadsheets as the notorious Red Jamie Fraser, he had determined to kill or capture him.</p><p>The notion of returning to camp for help had occurred to him, but the man was alone\u2014at least John had thought he was alone\u2014and evidently unawares, seated quietly upon a log, eating a bit of bread.</p><p>And so he had drawn his knife from his belt and crept quietly through the wood toward that shining red head, the haft slippery in his grasp, his mind filled with visions of glory and Hector\u2019s praise.</p><p>Instead, there had been a glancing blow as his knife flashed down, his arm locked tight round the Scot\u2019s neck to choke him, and then\u2014</p><p>Lord John Grey flung himself over in his bed, hot with remembrance. They had fallen back, rolling together in the crackling oak-leaf dark, grappling for the knife, thrashing and fighting\u2014for his life, he had thought.</p><p>First the Scot had been under him, then twisting, somehow over. He had touched a great snake once, a python that a friend of his uncle\u2019s had brought from the Indies, and that was what it had been like, Fraser\u2019s touch, lithe and smooth and horribly powerful, moving like the muscular coils, never where you expected it to be.</p><p>He had been flung ignominiously on his face in the leaves, his wrist twisted painfully behind his back. In a frenzy of terror, convinced he was about to be slain, he had wrenched with all his strength at his trapped arm, and the bone had snapped, with a red-black burst of pain that rendered him momentarily senseless.</p><p>He had come to himself moments later, slumped against a tree, facing a circle of ferocious-looking Highlanders, all in their plaids. In the midst of them stood Red Jamie Fraser\u2014and the woman.</p><p>Grey clenched his teeth. Curse that woman! If it hadn\u2019t been for her\u2014well, God knew what might have happened. What had happened was that she had spoken. She was English, a lady by her speech, and he\u2014idiot that he was!\u2014had leapt at once to the conclusion that she was a hostage of the vicious Highlanders, no doubt kidnapped for the purpose of ravishment. Everyone said that Highlanders indulged in rapine at every opportunity, and took delight in dishonoring Englishwomen; how should he have known otherwise!</p><p>And Lord John William Grey, aged sixteen and filled to the brim with regimental notions of gallantry and noble purpose, bruised, shaken, and fighting the pain of his broken arm, had tried to bargain, to save her from her fate. Fraser, tall and mocking, had played him like a salmon, stripping the woman half-naked before him to force from him information about the position and strength of his brother\u2019s regiment. And then, when he had told all he could, Fraser had laughingly revealed that the woman was his wife. They\u2019d all laughed; he could hear the ribald Scottish voices now, hilarious in memory.</p><p>Grey rolled over, shifting his weight irritably on the unaccustomed mattress. And to make it all worse, Fraser had not even had the decency to kill him, but instead had tied him to a tree, where he would be found by his friends in the morning. By which time Fraser\u2019s men had visited the camp and\u2014with the information he had given them!\u2014had immobilized the cannon they were bringing to Cope.</p><p>Everyone had found out, of course, and while excuses were made because of his age and his noncommissioned status, he had been a pariah and an object of scorn. No one would speak to him, save his brother\u2014and Hector. Loyal Hector.</p><p>He sighed, rubbing his cheek against the pillow. He could see Hector still, in his mind\u2019s eye. Dark-haired and blue-eyed, tender-mouthed, always smiling. It had been ten years since Hector had died at Culloden, hacked to pieces by a Highland broadsword, and still John woke in the dawn sometimes, body arched in clutching spasm, feeling Hector\u2019s touch.</p><p>And now this. He had dreaded this posting, being surrounded by Scots, by their grating voices, overwhelmed with the memory of what they had done to Hector. But never, in the most dismal moments of anticipation, had he thought he would ever meet James Fraser again.</p><p>The peat fire on the hearth died gradually to hot ash, then cold, and the window paled from deep black to the sullen gray of a rainy Scottish dawn. And still John Grey lay sleepless, burning eyes fixed on the smoke-blackened beams above him.</p><p>Grey rose in the morning unrested, but with his mind made up. He was here. Fraser was here. And neither could leave, for the foreseeable future. So. He must see the man now and again\u2014he would be speaking to the assembled prisoners in an hour, and must inspect them regularly thereafter\u2014but he would not see him privately. If he kept the man himself at a distance, perhaps he could also keep at bay the memories he stirred. And the feelings.</p><p>For while it was the memory of his past rage and humiliation that had kept him awake to begin with, it was the other side of the present situation that had left him still wakeful at dawn. The slowly dawning realization that Fraser was now his prisoner; no longer his tormentor, but a prisoner, like the others, entirely at his mercy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rang the bell for his servant and padded to the window to see how the weather kept, wincing at the chill of the stone under his bare feet.</p><p>It was, not surprisingly, raining. In the courtyard below, the prisoners were already being formed up in work crews, wet to the skin. Shivering in his shirt, Grey pulled in his head and shut the window halfway; a nice compromise between death from suffocation and death from the ague.</p><p>It had been visions of revenge that kept him tossing in his bed as the window lightened and the rain pattered on the sill; thoughts of Fraser confined to a tiny cell of freezing stone, kept naked through the winter nights, fed on slops, stripped and flogged in the courtyard of the prison. All that arrogant power humbled, reduced to groveling misery, dependent solely on his word for a moment\u2019s relief.</p><p>Yes, he thought all those things, imagined them in vivid detail, reveled in them. He heard Fraser beg for mercy, imagined himself disdaining, haughty. He thought these things, and the spiked object turned over in his guts, piercing him with self-disgust.</p> <p>Whatever he might once have been to Grey, Fraser now was a beaten foe; a prisoner of war, and the charge of the Crown. He was Grey\u2019s charge, in fact; a responsibility, and his welfare the duty of honor.</p><p>His servant had brought hot water for shaving. He splashed his cheeks, feeling the warmth soothe him, laying to rest the tormented fancies of the night. That was all they were, he realized\u2014fancies, and the realization brought him a certain relief.</p><p>He might have met Fraser in battle and taken a real and savage pleasure in killing or maiming him. But the inescapable fact was that so long as Fraser was his prisoner, he could not in honor harm the man. By the time he had shaved and his servant had dressed him, he was recovered enough to find a certain grim humor in the situation.</p><p>His foolish behavior at Carryarrick had saved Fraser\u2019s life at Culloden. Now, that debt discharged, and Fraser in his power, Fraser\u2019s sheer helplessness as a prisoner made him completely safe. For whether foolish or wise, naive or experienced, all the Greys were men of honor.</p><p>Feeling somewhat better, he met his gaze in the looking glass, set his wig to rights, and went to eat breakfast before giving his first address to the prisoners.</p> <p>\u201cWill you have your supper served in the sitting room, sir, or in here?\u201d MacKay\u2019s head, uncombed as ever, poked into the office.</p><p>\u201cUm?\u201d Grey murmured, absorbed in the papers spread out on the desk. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, looking up. \u201cIn here, if you please.\u201d He waved vaguely at the corner of the huge desk and returned to his work, scarcely looking up when the tray with his food arrived sometime later.</p><p>Quarry had not been joking about the paperwork. The sheer quantity of food alone required endless orders and requisitions\u2014all orders to be submitted in duplicate to London, if he pleased!\u2014let alone the hundreds of other necessities required by the prisoners, the guards, and the men and women from the village who came in by the day to clean the barracks and work in the kitchens. He had done nothing all day but write and sign requisitions. He must find a clerk soon, or die of sheer ennui.</p><p>Two hundred lb. wheat flowr, he wrote, for prisoners\u2019 use. Six hogsheads ale, for use of barracks. His normally elegant handwriting had quickly degenerated into a utilitarian scrawl, his stylish signature become a curt J. Grey.</p><p>He laid down his pen with a sigh and closed his eyes, massaging the ache between his brows. The sun had not bothered to show its face once since his arrival, and working all day in a smoky room by candlelight left his eyes burning like lumps of coal. His books had arrived the day before, but he had not even unpacked them, too exhausted by nightfall to do more than bathe his aching eyes in cold water and go to sleep.</p><p>He heard a small, stealthy sound, and sat up abruptly, his eyes popping open. A large brown rat sat on the corner of his desk, a morsel of plum cake held in its front paws. It didn\u2019t move, but merely looked at him speculatively, whiskers twitching.</p> <p>\u201cWell, God damn my eyes!\u201d Grey exclaimed in amazement. \u201cHere, you bugger! That\u2019s my supper!\u201d</p><p>The rat nibbled pensively at the plum cake, bright beady eyes fixed on the Major.</p><p>\u201cGet out of it!\u201d Enraged, Grey snatched up the nearest object and let fly at the rat. The ink bottle exploded on the stone floor in a spray of black, and the startled rat leapt off the desk and fled precipitously, galloping between the legs of the even more startled MacKay, who appeared at the door to see what the noise was.</p><p>\u201cHas the prison got a cat?\u201d Grey demanded, dumping the contents of his supper tray into the waste can by his desk.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir, there\u2019s cats in the storerooms,\u201d MacKay offered, crawling backward on hands and knees to wipe up the small black footprints the rat had left in its precipitous flight through the ink puddle.</p><p>\u201cWell, fetch one up here, if you please, MacKay,\u201d Grey ordered. \u201cAt once.\u201d He grunted at the memory of that obscenely naked tail draped nonchalantly over his plate. He had encountered rats often enough in the field, of course, but there was something about having his own personal supper molested before his eyes that seemed particularly infuriating.</p><p>He strode to the window and stood there, trying to clear his head with fresh air, as MacKay finished his mopping-up. Dusk was drawing down, filling the courtyard with purple shadows. The stones of the cell wing opposite looked even colder and more dreary than usual.</p><p>The turnkeys were coming through the rain from the kitchen wing; a procession of small carts laden with the prisoners\u2019 food; huge pots of steaming oatmeal and baskets of bread, covered with cloths against the rain. At least the poor devils had hot food after their wet day\u2019s work in the stone quarry.</p> <p>A thought struck him as he turned from the window.</p><p>\u201cAre there many rats in the cells?\u201d he asked MacKay.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir, a great many,\u201d the prisoner replied, with a final swipe to the threshold. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the cook to make ye up a fresh tray, shall I, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you please,\u201d Grey said. \u201cAnd then if you will, Mr. MacKay, please see that each cell is provided with its own cat.\u201d</p><p>MacKay looked slightly dubious at this. Grey paused in the act of retrieving his scattered papers.</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong, MacKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d MacKay replied slowly. \u201cOnly the wee brown beasties do keep down the cockchafers. And with respect, sir, I dinna think the men would care to have a cat takin\u2019 all their rats.\u201d</p><p>Grey stared at the man, feeling mildly queasy.</p><p>\u201cThe prisoners eat the rats?\u201d he asked, with a vivid memory of sharp yellow teeth nibbling at his plum cake.</p><p>\u201cOnly when they\u2019re lucky enough to catch one, sir,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cPerhaps the cats would be a help wi\u2019 that, after all. Will that be all for tonight, sir?\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>THE WANDERER</p><p>Grey\u2019s resolve concerning James Fraser lasted for two weeks. Then the messenger arrived from the village of Ardsmuir, with news that changed everything.</p><p>\u201cDoes he still live?\u201d he asked the man sharply. The messenger, one of the inhabitants of Ardsmuir village who worked for the prison, nodded.</p><p>\u201cI saw him mysel\u2019, sir, when they brought him in. He\u2019s at the Lime Tree now, being cared for\u2014but I didna think he looked as though care would be enough, sir, if ye take my meaning.\u201d He raised one brow significantly.</p><p>\u201cI take it,\u201d Grey answered shortly. \u201cThank you, Mr.\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison, sir, Rufus Allison. Your servant, sir.\u201d The man accepted the shilling offered him, bowed with his hat under his arm, and took his leave.</p><p>Grey sat at his desk, staring out at the leaden sky. The sun had scarcely shone for a day since his arrival. He tapped the end of the quill with which he had been writing on the desk, oblivious to the damage he was inflicting on the sharpened tip.</p><p>The mention of gold was enough to prick up any man\u2019s ears, but especially his.</p><p>A man had been found this morning, wandering in the mist on the moor near the village. His clothes were soaked not only with the damp, but with seawater, and he was out of his mind with fever.</p><p>He had talked unceasingly since he was found, babbling for the most part, but his rescuers were unable to make much sense of his ravings. The man appeared to be Scottish, and yet he spoke in an incoherent mixture of French and Gaelic, with here and there the odd word of English thrown in. And one of those words had been \u201cgold.\u201d</p><p>The combination of Scots, gold, and the French tongue, mentioned in this area of the country, could bring only one thought to the mind of anyone who had fought through the last days of the Jacobite rising. The Frenchman\u2019s Gold. The fortune in gold bullion that Louis of France had\u2014according to rumor\u2014sent secretly to the aid of his cousin, Charles Stuart. But sent far too late.</p><p>Some stories said that the French gold had been hidden by the Highland army during the last headlong retreat to the North, before the final disaster at Culloden. Others held that the gold had never reached Charles Stuart, but had been left for safekeeping in a cave near the place where it had come ashore on the northwestern coast.</p><p>Some said that the secret of the hiding place had been lost, its guardian killed at Culloden. Others said that the hiding place was still known, but a close-kept secret, held among the members of a single Highland family. Whatever the truth, the gold had never been found. Not yet.</p><p>French and Gaelic. Grey spoke passable French, the result of several years fighting abroad, but neither he nor any of his officers spoke the barbarous Gaelic, save a few words Sergeant Grissom had learned as a child from a Scottish nursemaid.</p><p>He could not trust a man from the village; not if there was anything to this tale. The Frenchman\u2019s Gold! Beyond its value as treasure\u2014which would belong to the Crown in any case\u2014the gold had a considerable and personal value to John William Grey. The finding of that half-mythical hoard would be his passport out of Ardsmuir\u2014back to London and civilization. The blackest disgrace would be instantly obscured by the dazzle of gold.</p><p>He bit the end of the blunted quill, feeling the cylinder crack between his teeth.</p><p>Damn. No, it couldn\u2019t be a villager, nor one of his officers. A prisoner, then. Yes, he could use a prisoner without risk, for a prisoner would be unable to make use of the information for his own ends.</p><p>Damn again. All of the prisoners spoke Gaelic, many had some English as well\u2014but only one spoke French besides. He is an educated man, Quarry\u2019s voice echoed in his memory.</p><p>\u201cDamn, damn, damn!\u201d Grey muttered. It couldn\u2019t be helped. Allison had said the wanderer was very ill; there was no time to look for alternatives. He spat out a shred of quill.</p><p>\u201cBrame!\u201d he shouted. The startled corporal poked his head in.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring me a prisoner named James Fraser. At once.\u201d</p><p>The Governor stood behind his desk, leaning on it as though the huge slab of oak were in fact the bulwark it looked. His hands were damp on the smooth wood, and the white stock of his uniform felt tight around his neck.</p><p>His heart leapt violently as the door opened. The Scot came in, his irons chinking slightly, and stood before the desk. The candles were all lit, and the office nearly as bright as day, though it was nearly full dark outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had seen Fraser several times, of course, standing in the courtyard with the other prisoners, red head and shoulders above most of the other men, but never close enough to see his face clearly.</p><p>He looked different. That was both shock and relief; for so long, he had seen a clean-shaven face in memory, dark with threat or alight with mocking laughter. This man was short-bearded, his face calm and wary, and while the deep blue eyes were the same, they gave no sign of recognition. The man stood quietly before the desk, waiting.</p><p>Grey cleared his throat. His heart was still beating too fast, but at least he could speak calmly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank you for coming.\u201d</p> <p>The Scot bent his head courteously, but did not answer that he had had no choice in the matter; his eyes said that.</p><p>\u201cDoubtless you wonder why I have sent for you,\u201d Grey said. He sounded insufferably pompous to his own ears, but was unable to remedy it. \u201cI find that a situation has arisen in which I require your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, Major?\u201d The voice was the same\u2014deep and precise, marked with a soft Highland burr.</p><p>He took a deep breath, bracing himself on the desk. He would rather have done anything but ask help of this particular man, but there was no bloody choice. Fraser was the only possibility.</p><p>\u201cA man has been found wandering the moor near the coast,\u201d he said carefully. \u201cHe appears to be seriously ill, and his speech is deranged. However, certain...matters to which he refers appear to be of...substantial interest to the Crown. I require to talk with him, and discover as much as I can of his identity, and the matters of which he speaks.\u201d</p> <p>He paused, but Fraser merely stood there, waiting.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Grey said, taking another breath, \u201cthe man in question has been heard to speak in a mixture of Gaelic and French, with no more than a word or two of English.\u201d</p><p>One of the Scot\u2019s ruddy eyebrows stirred. His face didn\u2019t change in any appreciable way, but it was evident that he had grasped the implications of the situation.</p><p>\u201cI see, Major.\u201d The Scot\u2019s soft voice was full of irony. \u201cAnd you would like my assistance to interpret for ye what this man might have to say.\u201d</p><p>Grey couldn\u2019t trust himself to speak, but merely jerked his head in a short nod.</p><p>\u201cI fear I must decline, Major.\u201d Fraser spoke respectfully, but with a glint in his eye that was anything but respectful. Grey\u2019s hand curled tight around the brass letter-opener on his blotter.</p> <p>\u201cYou decline?\u201d he said. He tightened his grasp on the letter-opener in order to keep his voice steady. \u201cMight I inquire why, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a prisoner, Major,\u201d the Scot said politely. \u201cNot an interpreter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour assistance would be\u2014appreciated,\u201d Grey said, trying to infuse the word with significance without offering outright bribery. \u201cConversely,\u201d his tone hardened, \u201ca failure to render legitimate assistance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not legitimate for ye either to extort my services or to threaten me, Major.\u201d Fraser\u2019s voice was a good deal harder than Grey\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI did not threaten you!\u201d The edge of the letter-opener was cutting into his hand; he was forced to loosen his grip.</p><p>\u201cDid ye no? Well, and I\u2019m pleased to hear it.\u201d Fraser turned toward the door. \u201cIn that case, Major, I shall bid ye good night.\u201d</p><p>Grey would have given a great deal simply to have let him go. Unfortunately, duty called.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d The Scot stopped, a few feet from the door, but didn\u2019t turn.</p> <p>Grey took a deep breath, steeling himself to it.</p><p>\u201cIf you do what I ask, I will have your irons struck off,\u201d he said.</p><p>Fraser stood quite still. Young and inexperienced Grey might be, but he was not unobservant. Neither was he a poor judge of men. Grey watched the rise of his prisoner\u2019s head, the increased tension of his shoulders, and felt a small relaxation of the anxiety that had gripped him since the news of the wanderer had come.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser?\u201d he said.</p><p>Very slowly, the Scot turned around. His face was quite expressionless.</p><p>\u201cYou have a bargain, Major,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>It was well past midnight when they arrived in the village of Ardsmuir. No lights showed in the cottages they passed, and Grey found himself wondering what the inhabitants thought, as the sound of hooves and the jingle of arms passed by their windows late at night, a faint echo of the English troops who had swept through the Highlands ten years before.</p><p>The wanderer had been taken to the Lime Tree, an inn so called because for many years, it had boasted a huge lime tree in the yard; the only tree of any size for thirty miles. There was nothing left now but a broad stump\u2014the tree, like so many other things, had perished in the aftermath of Culloden, burned for firewood by Cumberland\u2019s troops\u2014but the name remained.</p><p>At the door, Grey paused and turned to Fraser.</p><p>\u201cYou will recall the terms of our agreement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Fraser answered shortly, and brushed past him.</p><p>In return for having the irons removed, Grey had required three things: firstly, that Fraser would not attempt to escape during the journey to or from the village. Secondly, Fraser would undertake to give a full and true account of all that the vagrant should say. And thirdly, Fraser would give his word as a gentleman to speak to no one but Grey of what he learned.</p><p>There was a murmur of Gaelic voices inside; a sound of surprise as the innkeeper saw Fraser, and deference at the sight of the red coat behind him. The goodwife stood on the stair, an oil-dip in her hand making the shadows dance around her.</p><p>Grey laid a hand on the innkeeper\u2019s arm, startled.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d There was another figure on the stairs, an apparition, clothed all in black.</p><p>\u201cThat is the priest,\u201d Fraser said quietly, beside him. \u201cThe man will be dying, then.\u201d</p><p>Grey took a deep breath, trying to steady himself for what might come.</p><p>\u201cThen there is little time to waste,\u201d he said firmly, setting a booted foot on the stair. \u201cLet us proceed.\u201d</p><p>The man died just before dawn, Fraser holding one of his hands, the priest the other. As the priest leaned over the bed, mumbling in Gaelic and Latin, making Popish signs over the body, Fraser sat back on his stool, eyes closed, still holding the small, frail hand in his own.</p><p>The big Scot had sat by the man\u2019s side all night, listening, encouraging, comforting. Grey had stood by the door, not wishing to frighten the man by the sight of his uniform, both surprised and oddly touched at Fraser\u2019s gentleness.</p><p>Now Fraser laid the thin weathered hand gently across the still chest, and made the same sign as the priest had, touching forehead, heart, and both shoulders in turn, in the sign of a cross. He opened his eyes, and rose to his feet, his head nearly brushing the low rafters. He nodded briefly to Grey, and preceded him down the narrow stair.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d Grey motioned to the door of the taproom, empty at this hour. A sleepy-eyed barmaid laid the fire for them and brought bread and ale, then went out, leaving them alone.</p><p>He waited for Fraser to refresh himself before asking.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>The Scot set down his pewter mug and wiped a hand across his mouth. Already bearded, with his long hair neatly plaited, he didn\u2019t look disheveled by the long night watch, but there were dark smudges of tiredness under his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesna make a great deal of sense, Major,\u201d he added warningly, \u201cbut this is all he said.\u201d And he spoke carefully, pausing now and then to recall a word, stopping again to explain some Gaelic reference. Grey sat listening in deepening disappointment; Fraser had been correct\u2014it didn\u2019t make much sense.</p><p>\u201cThe white witch?\u201d Grey interrupted. \u201cHe spoke of a white witch? And seals?\u201d It scarcely seemed more farfetched than the rest of it, but still he spoke disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cAye, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it to me again,\u201d Grey commanded. \u201cAs best you remember. If you please,\u201d he added.</p><p>He felt oddly comfortable with the man, he realized, with a feeling of surprise. Part of it was sheer fatigue, of course; all his usual reactions and feelings were numbed by the long night and the strain of watching a man die by inches.</p><p>The entire night had seemed unreal to Grey; not least was this odd conclusion, wherein he found himself sitting in the dim dawn light of a country tavern, sharing a pitcher of ale with Red Jamie Fraser.</p><p>Fraser obeyed, speaking slowly, stopping now and then to recall. With the difference of a word here or there, it was identical to the first account\u2014and those parts of it that Grey himself had been able to understand were faithfully translated.</p><p>He shook his head, discouraged. Gibberish. The man\u2019s ravings had been precisely that\u2014ravings. If the man had ever seen any gold\u2014and it did sound as though he had, at one time\u2014there was no telling where or when from this hodgepodge of delusion and feverish delirium.</p><p>\u201cYou are quite positive that is all he said?\u201d Grey grasped at the slim hope that Fraser might have omitted some small phrase, some statement that would yield a clue to the lost gold.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s sleeve fell back as he lifted his cup; Grey could see the deep band of raw flesh about his wrist, dark in the gray early light of the taproom. Fraser saw him looking at it, and set down the cup, the frail illusion of companionship shattered.</p><p>\u201cI keep my bargains, Major,\u201d Fraser said, with cold formality. He rose to his feet. \u201cShall we be going back now?\u201d</p><p>They rode in silence for some time. Fraser was lost in his own thoughts, Grey sunk in fatigue and disappointment. They stopped at a small spring to refresh themselves, just as the sun topped the small hills to the north.</p><p>Grey drank cold water, then splashed it on his face, feeling the shock of it revive him momentarily. He had been awake for more than twenty-four hours, and was feeling slow and stupid.</p><p>Fraser had been awake for the same twenty-four hours, but gave no apparent sign of being troubled by the fact. He was crawling busily around the spring on his hands and knees, evidently plucking some sort of weed from the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Mr. Fraser?\u201d Grey asked, in some bewilderment.</p><p>Fraser looked up, mildly surprised, but not embarrassed in the slightest.</p><p>\u201cI am picking watercress, Major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d Grey said testily. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo eat, Major,\u201d Fraser replied evenly. He took the stained cloth bag from his belt and dropped the dripping green mass into it.</p><p>\u201cIndeed? Are you not fed sufficiently?\u201d Grey asked blankly. \u201cI have never heard of people eating watercress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s green, Major.\u201d</p><p>In his fatigued state, the Major had suspicions that he was being practiced upon.</p><p>\u201cWhat in damnation other color ought a weed to be?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s mouth twitched slightly, and he seemed to be debating something with himself. At last he shrugged slightly, wiping his wet hands on the sides of his breeks.</p><p>\u201cI only meant, Major, that eating green plants will stop ye getting scurvy and loose teeth. My men eat such greens as I take them, and cress is better-tasting than most things I can pick on the moor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grey felt his brows shoot up.</p><p>\u201cGreen plants stop scurvy?\u201d he blurted. \u201cWherever did you get that notion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my wife!\u201d Fraser snapped. He turned away abruptly, and stood, tying the neck of his sack with hard, quick movements.</p><p>Grey could not prevent himself asking.</p> <p>\u201cYour wife, sir\u2014where is she?\u201d</p><p>The answer was a sudden blaze of dark blue that seared him to the backbone, so shocking was its intensity.</p><p>Perhaps you are too young to know the power of hate and despair. Quarry\u2019s voice spoke in Grey\u2019s memory. He was not; he recognized them at once in the depths of Fraser\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Only for a moment, though; then the man\u2019s normal veil of cool politeness was back in place.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is gone,\u201d Fraser said, and turned away again, so abruptly that the movement verged on rudeness.</p> <p>Grey felt himself shaken by an unexpected feeling. In part it was relief. The woman who had been both cause of and party to his humiliation was dead. In part, it was regret.</p><p>Neither of them spoke again on the journey back to Ardsmuir.</p><p>Three days later, Jamie Fraser escaped. It had never been a difficult matter for prisoners to escape from Ardsmuir; no one ever did, simply because there was no place for a man to go. Three miles from the prison, the coast of Scotland dropped into the ocean in a spill of crumbled granite. On the other three sides, nothing but empty moorland stretched for miles.</p><p>Once, a man might take to the heather, depending on clan and kinsmen for support and protection. But the clans were crushed, the kin dead, the Scottish prisoners removed far away from their own clan lands. Starving on the bleak moor was little improvement on a prison cell. Escape was not worth it\u2014to anyone but Jamie Fraser, who evidently had a reason.</p><p>The dragoons\u2019 horses kept to the road; while the surrounding moor looked smooth as a velvet counterpane, the purpling heather was a thin layer, deceptively spread over a foot or more of wet, spongy peat moss. Even the red deer didn\u2019t walk at random in that boggy mass\u2014Grey could see four of the animals now, stick figures a mile away, the line of their track through the heather seeming no wider than a thread.</p><p>Fraser, of course, was not mounted. That meant that the escaped prisoner might be anywhere on the moor, free to follow the red deer\u2019s paths.</p> <p>It was John Grey\u2019s duty to pursue his prisoner and attempt his recapture. It was something more than duty that had made him strip the garrison for his search party, and urge them on with only the briefest of stops for rest and food. Duty, yes, and an urgent desire to find the French gold and win approval from his masters\u2014and reprieve from this desolate Scottish exile. But there was anger, too, and an odd sense of personal betrayal.</p><p>Grey wasn\u2019t sure whether he was more angry at Fraser for breaking his word, or at himself, for having been fool enough to believe that a Highlander\u2014gentleman or not\u2014held a sense of honor equal to his own. But angry he was, and determined to search every deer path on this moor if necessary, in order to lay James Fraser by the heels.</p><p>They reached the coast the next night, well after dark, after a laborious day of combing the moor. The fog had thinned away over the rocks, swept out by the offshore wind, and the sea spread out before them, cradled by cliffs and strewn with tiny barren islets.</p><p>John Grey stood beside his horse on the clifftops, looking down at the wild black sea. It was a clear night on the coast, thank God, and the moon was at the half; its gleam painted the spray-wet rocks, making them stand out hard and shining as silver ingots against black velvet shadows.</p><p>It was the most desolate place he had ever seen, though it had a sort of terrible beauty about it that made the blood run cold in his veins. There was no sign of James Fraser. No sign of life at all.</p><p>One of the men with him gave a sudden exclamation of surprise, and drew his pistol.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d he said. \u201cOn the rocks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold your fire, fool,\u201d said another of the soldiers, grabbing his companion\u2019s arm. He made no effort to disguise his contempt. \u201cHave you ne\u2019er seen seals?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh...no,\u201d said the first man, rather sheepishly. He lowered his pistol, staring out at the small dark forms on the rocks below.</p><p>Grey had never seen seals, either, and he watched them with fascination. They looked like black slugs from this distance, the moonlight gleaming wetly on their coats as they raised restless heads, seeming to roll and weave unsteadily as they made their awkward way on land.</p><p>His mother had had a cloak made of sealskin, when he was a boy. He had been allowed to touch it once, marveling at the feel of it, dark and warm as a moonless summer night. Amazing that such thick, soft fur came from these slick, wet creatures.</p><p>\u201cThe Scots call them silkies,\u201d said the soldier who had recognized them. He nodded at the seals with the proprietary air of special knowledge.</p><p>\u201cSilkies?\u201d Grey\u2019s attention was caught; he stared at the man with interest. \u201cWhat else do you know about them, Sykes?\u201d</p><p>The soldier shrugged, enjoying his momentary importance. \u201cNot a great deal, sir. The folk hereabout have stories about them, though; they say sometimes one of them will come ashore and leave off its skin, and inside is a beautiful woman. If a man should find the skin, and hide it, so she can\u2019t go back, why then\u2014she\u2019ll be forced to stay and be his wife. They make good wives, sir, or so I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least they\u2019d always be wet,\u201d murmured the first soldier, and the men erupted in guffaws that echoed among the cliffs, raucous as seabirds.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Grey had to raise his voice, to be heard above the rash of laughter and crude suggestions.</p><p>\u201cSpread out!\u201d Grey ordered. \u201cI want the cliffs searched in both directions\u2014and keep an eye out for boats below; God knows there\u2019s room enough to hide a sloop behind some of those islands.\u201d</p><p>Abashed, the men went without comment. They returned an hour later, wet from spray and disheveled with climbing, but with no sign of Jamie Fraser\u2014or the Frenchman\u2019s Gold.</p><p>At dawn, as the light stained the slippery rocks red and gold, small parties of dragoons were sent off to search the cliffs in both directions, making their way carefully down the rocky clefts and tumbled piles of stone.</p><p>Nothing was found. Grey stood by a fire on the clifftop, keeping an eye on the search. He was swathed in his greatcoat against the biting wind, and fortified periodically by hot coffee, supplied by his servant.</p><p>The man at the Lime Tree had come from the sea, his clothes soaked in saltwater. Whether Fraser had learned something from the man\u2019s words that he had not told, or had decided only to take the chance of looking for himself, surely he also would have gone to the sea. And yet there was no sign of James Fraser, anywhere along this stretch of coast. Worse yet, there was no sign of the gold.</p><p>\u201cIf he went in anywhere along this stretch, Major, you\u2019ll have seen the last of him, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d It was Sergeant Grissom, standing beside him, gazing down at the crash and whirl of water through the jagged rocks below. He nodded at the furious water.</p><p>\u201cThey call this spot the Devil\u2019s Cauldron, because of the way it boils all the time. Fishermen drowned off this coast are seldom found; there are wicked currents to blame for it, of course, but folk say the Devil seizes them and pulls them below.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Grey said bleakly. He stared down into the smash and spume forty feet below. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt it, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>He turned back toward the campfire.</p><p>\u201cGive orders to search until nightfall, Sergeant. If nothing is found, we\u2019ll start back in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Grey lifted his gaze from his horse\u2019s neck, squinting through the dim early light. His eyes felt swollen from peat smoke and lack of sleep, and his bones ached from several nights spent lying on damp ground.</p><p>The ride back to Ardsmuir would take no more than a day. The thought of a soft bed and a hot supper was delightful\u2014but then he would have to write the official dispatch to London, confessing Fraser\u2019s escape\u2014the reason for it\u2014and his own shameful failure to recapture the man.</p><p>The feeling of bleakness at this prospect was reinforced by a deep griping in the major\u2019s lower abdomen. He raised a hand, signaling a halt, and slid wearily to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he said to his men. There was a small hillock a few hundred feet away; it would afford him sufficient privacy for the relief he sorely needed; his bowels, unaccustomed to Scottish parritch and oatcake, had rebelled altogether at the exigencies of a field diet.</p><p>The birds were singing in the heather. Away from the noise of hooves and harness, he could hear all the tiny sounds of the waking moor. The wind had changed with the dawn, and the scent of the sea came inland now, whispering through the grass. Some small animal made a rustling noise on the other side of a gorse bush. It was all very peaceful.</p><p>Straightening up from what too late struck him as a most undignified posture, Grey raised his head and looked straight into the face of James Fraser.</p><p>He was no more than six feet away. He stood still as one of the red deer, the moor wind brushing over him, with the rising sun tangled in his hair.</p><p>They stood frozen, staring at each other. The smell of the sea came faintly on the wind. There was no sound but the sea wind and the singing of meadowlarks for a moment. Then Grey drew himself up, swallowing to bring his heart down from his throat.</p><p>\u201cI fear you take me at a disadvantage, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said coolly, fastening his breeches with as much self-possession as he could muster.</p><p>The Scot\u2019s eyes were the only part of him to move, down over Grey and slowly back up. Looked over his shoulder, to where six armed soldiers stood, pointing their muskets. Dark blue eyes met his, straight on. At last, the edge of Fraser\u2019s mouth twitched, and he said, \u201cI think ye take me at the same, Major.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>WHITE WITCH\u2019S CURSE</p><p>Jamie Fraser sat shivering on the stone floor of the empty storeroom, clutching his knees and trying to get warm. He thought he likely would never be warm again. The chill of the sea had seeped into his bones, and he could still feel the churn of the crashing breakers, deep in his belly.</p><p>He wished for the presence of the other prisoners\u2014Morrison, Hayes, Sinclair, Sutherland. Not only for company, but for the heat of their bodies. On bitter nights, the men would huddle close together for warmth, breathing each other\u2019s stale breath, tolerating the bump and knock of close quarters for the sake of warmth.</p><p>He was alone, though. Likely they would not return him to the large cell with the other men until after they had done whatever they meant to do to him as punishment for escaping. He leaned back against the wall with a sigh, morbidly aware of the bones of his spine pressing against the stone, and the fragility of the flesh covering them.</p><p>He was very much afraid of being flogged, and yet he hoped that would be his punishment. It would be horrible, but it would be soon over\u2014and infinitely more bearable than being put back in irons. He could feel in his flesh the crash of the smith\u2019s hammer, echoing through the bones of his arm as the smith pounded the fetters firmly into place, holding his wrist steady on the anvil.</p><p>His fingers sought the rosary around his neck. His sister had given it to him when he left Lallybroch; the English had let him keep it, as the string of beechwood beads had no value. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHail Mary, full of grace,\u201d he muttered, \u201cblessed art thou amongst women.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t much hope.

It was no part of his bargain to tell the Englishman that he knew the man\u2014or what conclusions he had drawn from the muttered words.</p><p>He had recognized Duncan Kerr at once, changed though he was by time and mortal illness.

Duncan was an elderly man, his worn face wasted by illness and fatigue, and his eyes were bright with fever. At first he had thought Duncan too far gone to know him, but the wasted hand had gripped his with surprising strength, and the man had repeated through his rasping breath, \u201cmo charaid.\u201d My kinsman.</p><p>The innkeeper was watching, from his place near the door, peering over Major Grey\u2019s shoulder. Jamie had bent his head and whispered in Duncan\u2019s ear, \u201cAll you say will be told to the English. Speak wary.\u201d The landlord\u2019s eyes narrowed, but the distance between them was too far; Jamie was sure he hadn\u2019t heard. Then the Major had turned and ordered the innkeeper out, and he was safe.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell whether it was the effect of his warning, or only the derangement of fever, but Duncan\u2019s speech wandered with his mind, often incoherent, images of the past overlapping with those of the present. Sometimes he had called Jamie \u201cDougal,\u201d the name of Colum\u2019s brother, Jamie\u2019s other uncle. Sometimes he dropped into poetry, sometimes he simply raved. And within the ravings and the scattered words, sometimes there was a grain of sense\u2014or more than sense.</p> <p>\u201cIt is cursed,\u201d Duncan whispered. \u201cThe gold is cursed. Do ye be warned, lad. It was given by the white witch, given for the King\u2019s son. But the Cause is lost, and the King\u2019s son fled, and she will not let the gold be given to a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Jamie asked. His heart had sprung up and choked him at Duncan\u2019s words, and it beat madly as he asked. \u201cThe white witch\u2014who is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seeks a brave man. A MacKenzie, it is for Himself. MacKenzie. It is theirs, she says it, for the sake of him who is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is the witch?\u201d Jamie asked again. The word Duncan used was ban-druidh\u2014a witch, a wisewoman, a white lady. They had called his wife that, once. Claire\u2014his own white lady. He squeezed Duncan\u2019s hand tight in his own, willing him to keep his senses.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he said again. \u201cWho is the witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch,\u201d Duncan muttered, his eyes closing. \u201cThe witch. She is a soul-eater. She is death. He is dead, the MacKenzie, he is dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho is dead? Colum MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them, all of them. All dead. All dead!\u201d cried the sick man, clutching tight to his hand. \u201cColum, and Dougal, and Ellen, too.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly his eyes opened, and fixed on Jamie\u2019s. The fever had dilated his pupils, so his gaze seemed a pool of drowning black.</p><p>\u201cFolk do say,\u201d he said, with surprising clarity, \u201cas how Ellen MacKenzie did leave her brothers and her home, and go to wed with a silkie from the sea. She heard them, aye?\u201d Duncan smiled dreamily, the black stare swimming with distant vision. \u201cShe heard the silkies singing, there upon the rocks, one, and two, and three of them, and she saw from her tower, one and two, and three of them, and so she came down, and went to the sea, and so under it, to live wi\u2019 the silkies. Aye? Did she no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo folk say,\u201d Jamie had answered, mouth gone dry. Ellen had been his mother\u2019s name. And that was what folk had said, when she had left her home, to elope with Brian Dubh Fraser, a man with the shining black hair of a silkie. The man for whose sake he was himself now called Mac Dubh\u2014Black Brian\u2019s son.</p><p>Major Grey stood close, on the other side of the bed, brow furrowed as he watched Duncan\u2019s face. The Englishman had no Gaelic, but Jamie would have been willing to wager that he knew the word for gold. He caught the Major\u2019s eye, and nodded, bending again to speak to the sick man.</p><p>\u201cThe gold, man,\u201d he said, in French, loud enough for Grey to hear. \u201cWhere is the gold?\u201d He squeezed Duncan\u2019s hand as hard as he could, hoping to convey some warning.</p><p>Duncan\u2019s eyes closed, and he rolled his head restlessly, to and fro upon the pillow. He muttered something, but the words were too faint to catch.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d the Major demanded sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jamie patted Duncan\u2019s hand to rouse him. \u201cSpeak to me, man, tell me again.\u201d</p><p>There was no response save more muttering. Duncan\u2019s eyes had rolled back in his head, so that only a thin line of gleaming white showed beneath the wrinkled lids. Impatient, the Major leaned forward and shook him by one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWake up!\u201d he said. \u201cSpeak to us!\u201d</p><p>At once Duncan Kerr\u2019s eyes flew open. He stared up, up, past the two faces bending over him, seeing something far beyond them.</p><p>\u201cShe will tell you,\u201d he said, in Gaelic. \u201cShe will come for you.\u201d For a split second, his attention seemed to return to the inn room where he lay, and his eyes focused on the men with him. \u201cFor both of you,\u201d he said distinctly.</p><p>Then he closed his eyes, and spoke no more, but clung ever tighter to Jamie\u2019s hand. Then after a time, his grip relaxed, his hand slid free, and it was over. The guardianship of the gold had passed.</p><p>And so, Jamie Fraser had kept his word to the Englishman\u2014and his obligation to his countrymen. He had told the Major all that Duncan had said, and the devil of a help to him that had been! And when the opportunity of escape offered, he had taken it\u2014gone to the heather and sought the sea, and done what he could with Duncan Kerr\u2019s legacy. And now he must pay the price of his actions, whatever that turned out to be.</p><p>There were footsteps coming down the corridor outside. He clutched his knees harder, trying to quell the shivering. At least it would be decided now, either way.</p><p>\u201c...pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death, amen.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, letting in a shaft of light that made him blink. It was dark in the corridor, but the guard standing over him held a torch.</p><p>\u201cOn your feet.\u201d The man reached down and pulled him up against the stiffness of his joints. He was pushed toward the door, stumbling. \u201cYou\u2019re wanted upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs? Where?\u201d He was startled at that\u2014the smith\u2019s forge was downstairs from where he was, off the courtyard. And they wouldn\u2019t flog him so late in the evening.</p><p>The man\u2019s face twisted, fierce and ruddy in the torchlight. \u201cTo the Major\u2019s quarters,\u201d the guard said, grinning. \u201cAnd may God have mercy on your soul, Mac Dubh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I will not say where I have been.\u201d He repeated it firmly, trying not to let his teeth chatter. He had been brought not to the office, but to Grey\u2019s private sitting room. There was a fire on the hearth, but Grey was standing in front of it, blocking most of the warmth.</p><p>\u201cNor why you chose to escape?\u201d Grey\u2019s voice was cool and formal.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face tightened. He had been placed near the bookshelf, where the light of a triple-branched candlestick fell on his face; Grey himself was no more than a silhouette, black against the fire\u2019s glow.</p><p>\u201cThat is my private affair,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPrivate affair?\u201d Grey echoed incredulously. \u201cDid you say your private affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>The Governor inhaled strongly through his nose.</p><p>\u201cThat is possibly the most outrageous thing I have heard in my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life has been rather brief, then, Major,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cIf you will pardon my saying so.\u201d There was no point in dragging it out or trying to placate the man. Better to provoke a decision at once and get it over with. He had certainly provoked something; Grey\u2019s fists clenched tight at his sides, and he took a step toward him, away from the fire.</p><p>\u201cHave you any notion what I could do to you for this?\u201d Grey inquired, his voice low and very much controlled.</p><p>\u201cAye, I have. Major.\u201d More than a notion. He knew from experience what they might do to him, and he wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. It wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d a choice about it, though.</p><p>Grey breathed heavily for a moment, then jerked his head.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he ordered. Jamie stared at him, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d he said peremptorily, pointing to a spot directly before him on the hearthrug. \u201cStand here, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a dog, Major!\u201d Jamie snapped. \u201cYe\u2019ll do as ye like wi\u2019 me, but I\u2019ll no come when ye call me to heel!\u201d</p><p>Taken by surprise, Grey uttered a short, involuntary laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI meant no offense by the address. I merely wish you to approach nearer. If you will?\u201d He stepped aside and bowed elaborately, gesturing to the hearth.</p><p>Jamie hesitated, but then stepped warily onto the patterned rug. Grey stepped close to him, nostrils flared. So close, the fine bones and fair skin of his face made him look almost girlish. The Major put a hand on his sleeve, and the long-lashed eyes sprang wide in shock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am wet,\u201d Jamie said, with elaborate patience. He was also freezing. A fine, continuous shiver ran through him, even this close to the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jamie echoed, astonished. \u201cDid you not order the guards to douse me wi\u2019 water before leaving me in a freezing cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not, no.\u201d It was clear enough that the Major was telling the truth; his face was pale under the ruddy flush of the firelight, and he looked angry. His lips thinned to a fine line.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for this, Mr. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccepted, Major.\u201d Small wisps of steam were beginning to rise from his clothes, but the warmth was seeping through the damp cloth. His muscles ached from the shivering, and he wished he could lie down on the hearthrug, dog or not.</p><p>\u201cDid your escape have anything to do with the matter of which you learned at the Lime Tree Inn?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood silent. The ends of his hair were drying, and small wisps floated across his face.</p><p>\u201cWill you swear to me that your escape had nothing to do with that matter?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood silent. There seemed no point in saying anything, now.</p><p>The little Major was pacing up and down the hearth before him, hands locked behind his back. Now and then, the Major glanced up at him, and then resumed his pacing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally he stopped in front of Jamie.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d he said formally. \u201cI will ask you once more\u2014why did you escape from the prison?\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed. He wouldn\u2019t get to stand by the fire much longer.</p><p>\u201cI cannot tell you, Major.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCannot or will not?\u201d Grey asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna seem a useful distinction, Major, as ye willna hear anything, either way.\u201d He closed his eyes and waited, trying to soak up as much heat as possible before they took him away.</p><p>Grey found himself at a loss, both for words and action. Stubborn does not begin to describe it, Quarry had said. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>He took a deep breath, wondering what to do. He found himself embarrassed by the petty cruelty of the guards\u2019 revenge; the more so because it was just such an action he had first contemplated upon hearing that Fraser was his prisoner.</p><p>He would be perfectly within his rights now to order the man flogged, or put back in irons. Condemned to solitary confinement, put on short rations\u2014he could in justice inflict any of a dozen different punishments. And if he did, the odds of his ever finding the Frenchman\u2019s Gold became vanishingly small.</p> <p>The gold did exist. Or at least there was a good probability that it did. Only a belief in that gold would have stirred Fraser to act as he had.</p><p>He eyed the man. Fraser\u2019s eyes were closed, his lips set firmly. He had a wide, strong mouth, whose grim expression was somewhat belied by the sensitive lips, set soft and exposed in their curly nest of red beard.</p><p>Grey paused, trying to think of some way to break past the man\u2019s wall of bland defiance. To use force would be worse than useless\u2014and after the guards\u2019 actions, he would be ashamed to order it, even had he the stomach for brutality.</p><p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck ten. It was late; there was no sound in the fortress, save the occasional footsteps of the soldier on sentry in the courtyard outside the window.</p><p>Clearly neither force nor threat would work in gaining the truth. Reluctantly, he realized that there was only one course open to him, if he still wished to pursue the gold. He must put aside his feelings about the man and take Quarry\u2019s suggestion. He must pursue an acquaintance, in the course of which he might worm out of the man some clue that would lead him to the hidden treasure.</p><p>If it existed, he reminded himself, turning to his prisoner. He took a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d he said formally, \u201cwill you do me the honor to take supper tomorrow in my quarters?\u201d</p><p>He had the momentary satisfaction of having startled the Scottish bastard, at least. The blue eyes opened wide, and then Fraser regained the mastery of his face. He paused for a moment, and then bowed with a flourish, as though he wore a kilt and swinging plaid, and not damp prison rags.</p><p>\u201cIt will be my pleasure to attend ye, Major,\u201d he said.</p><p>March 7, 1755</p><p>Fraser was delivered by the guard and left to wait in the sitting room, where a table was laid. When Grey came through the door from his bedroom a few moments later, he found his guest standing by the bookshelf, apparently absorbed in a copy of Nouvelle H\u00e9lo\u00efse.</p><p>\u201cYou are interested in French novels?\u201d he blurted, not realizing until too late how incredulous the question sounded.</p><p>Fraser glanced up, startled, and snapped the book shut. Very deliberately, he returned it to its shelf.</p><p>\u201cI can read, Major,\u201d he said. He had shaved; a slight flush burned high on his cheekbones.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014yes, of course I did not mean\u2014I merely\u2014\u201d Grey\u2019s own cheeks were more flushed than Fraser\u2019s. The fact was that he had subconsciously assumed that the other did not read, his evident education notwithstanding, merely because of his Highland accent and shabby dress.</p><p>While his coat might be shabby, Fraser\u2019s manners were not. He ignored Grey\u2019s flustered apology, and turned to the bookshelf.</p><p>\u201cI have been telling the men the story, but it has been some time since I read it; I thought I would refresh my memory as to the sequence of the ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Just in time, Grey stopped himself from saying \u201cThey understand it?\u201d</p><p>Fraser evidently read the unspoken question in his face, for he said dryly, \u201cAll Scottish children are taught their letters, Major. Still, we have a great tradition of storytelling in the Highlands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes. I see.\u201d</p><p>The entry of his servant with dinner saved him from further awkwardness, and the supper passed uneventfully, though there was little conversation, and that little, limited to the affairs of the prison.</p><p>The next time, he had had the chess table set up before the fire, and invited Fraser to join him in a game before the supper was served. There had been a brief flash of surprise from the slanted blue eyes, and then a nod of acquiescence.</p><p>That had been a small stroke of genius, Grey thought in retrospect. Relieved of the need for conversation or social courtesies, they had slowly become accustomed to each other as they sat over the inlaid board of ivory and ebony-wood, gauging each other silently by the movements of the chessmen.</p><p>When they had at length sat down to dine, they were no longer quite strangers, and the conversation, while still wary and formal, was at least true conversation, and not the awkward affair of starts and stops it had been before. They discussed matters of the prison, had a little conversation of books, and parted formally, but on good terms. Grey did not mention gold.</p><p>And so the weekly custom was established. Grey sought to put his guest at ease, in the hopes that Fraser might let drop some clue to the fate of the Frenchman\u2019s Gold. It had not come so far, despite careful probing. Any hint of inquiry as to what had transpired during the three days of Fraser\u2019s absence from Ardsmuir met with silence.</p><p>Over the mutton and boiled potatoes, he did his best to draw his odd guest into a discussion of France and its politics, by way of discovering whether there might exist any links between Fraser and a possible source of gold from the French Court.</p><p>Much to his surprise, he was informed that Fraser had in fact spent two years living in France, employed in the wine business, prior to the Stuart rebellion.</p><p>A certain cool humor in Fraser\u2019s eyes indicated that the man was well aware of the motives behind this questioning. At the same time, he acquiesced gracefully enough in the conversation, though taking some care always to lead questions away from his personal life, and instead toward more general matters of art and society.</p><p>Grey had spent some time in Paris, and despite his attempts at probing Fraser\u2019s French connections, found himself becoming interested in the conversation for its own sake.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Mr. Fraser, during your time in Paris, did you chance to encounter the dramatic works of Monsieur Voltaire?\u201d</p><p>Fraser smiled. \u201cOh, aye, Major. In fact, I was privileged to entertain Monsieur Arouet\u2014Voltaire being his nom de plume, aye?\u2014at my table, on more than one occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Grey cocked a brow in interest. \u201cAnd is he as great a wit in person as with the pen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldna really say,\u201d Fraser replied, tidily forking up a slice of mutton. \u201cHe seldom said anything at all, let alone much sparkling with wit. He only sat hunched over in his chair, watching everyone, wi\u2019 his eyes rolling about from one to another. I shouldna be at all surprised to hear that things said at my dinner table later appeared on the stage, though fortunately I never encountered a parody of myself in his work.\u201d He closed his eyes in momentary concentration, chewing his mutton.</p><p>\u201cIs the meat to your taste, Mr. Fraser?\u201d Grey inquired politely. It was gristled, tough, and seemed barely edible to him. But then, he might well think differently, had he been eating oatmeal, weeds, and the occasional rat.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is, Major, I thank ye.\u201d Fraser dabbed up a bit of wine sauce and brought the last bite to his lips, making no demur when Grey signaled MacKay to bring back the platter.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Arouet wouldna appreciate such an excellent meal, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Fraser said, shaking his head as he helped himself to more mutton.</p><p>\u201cI should expect a man so feted in French society to have somewhat more exacting tastes,\u201d Grey answered dryly. Half his own meal remained on his plate, destined for the supper of the cat Augustus.</p><p>Fraser laughed. \u201cScarcely that, Major,\u201d he assured Grey. \u201cI have never seen Monsieur Arouet consume anything beyond a glass of water and a dry biscuit, no matter how lavish the occasion. He\u2019s a weazened wee scrap of a man, ye ken, and a martyr to the indigestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Grey was fascinated. \u201cPerhaps that explains the cynicism of some of the sentiments I have seen expressed in his plays. Or do you not think that the character of an author shows in the construction of his work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven some of the characters that I have seen appear in plays and novels, Major, I should think the author a bit depraved who drew them entirely from himself, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that is so,\u201d Grey answered, smiling at the thought of some of the more extreme fictional characters with whom he was acquainted. \u201cThough if an author constructs these colorful personages from life, rather than from the depths of imagination, surely he must boast a most varied acquaintance!\u201d</p><p>Fraser nodded, brushing crumbs from his lap with the linen napkin.</p><p>\u201cIt was not Monsieur Arouet, but a colleague of his\u2014a lady novelist\u2014who remarked to me once that writing novels was a cannibal\u2019s art, in which one often mixed small portions of one\u2019s friends and one\u2019s enemies together, seasoned them with imagination, and allowed the whole to stew together into a savory concoction.\u201d</p><p>Grey laughed at the description, and beckoned to MacKay to take away the plates and bring in the decanters of port and sherry.</p><p>\u201cA delightful description, indeed! Speaking of cannibals, though, have you chanced to be acquainted with Mr. Defoe\u2019s Robinson Crusoe? It has been a favorite of mine since boyhood.\u201d</p><p>The conversation turned then to romances, and the excitement of the tropics. It was very late indeed when Fraser returned to his cell, leaving Major Grey entertained, but no wiser concerning either the source or the disposition of the wanderer\u2019s gold.</p><p>April 2, 1755</p><p>John Grey opened the packet of quills his mother had sent from London. Swan\u2019s quills, both finer and stronger than common goose-quills. He smiled faintly at the sight of them; an unsubtle reminder that his correspondence was in arrears.</p><p>His mother would have to wait until tomorrow, though. He took out the small, monogrammed penknife he always carried, and slowly trimmed a quill to his liking, composing in his mind what he meant to say. By the time he dipped his quill into the ink, the words were clear in his mind, and he wrote quickly, seldom pausing.</p><p>2 April, 1755</p><p>To Harold, Lord Melton, Earl of Moray</p><p>My dear Hal, he wrote, I write to inform you of a recent occurrence which has much engaged my attention. It may amount in the end to nothing, but if there be any substance in the matter, it is of great import. The details of the wandering man\u2019s appearance, and the report of his ravings followed swiftly, but Grey found himself slowing as he told of Fraser\u2019s escape and recapture.</p><p>The fact that Fraser vanished from the precincts of the prison so soon following these events suggests strongly to me that there was in truth some substance in the vagrant\u2019s words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If this were the case, however, I find myself at a loss to account for Fraser\u2019s subsequent actions. He was recaptured within three days of his escape, at a point no more than a mile from the coast. The country-side beyond the prison is deserted for a great many miles beyond the village of Ardsmuir, and there is little likelihood of his meeting with a confederate to whom he might pass word of the treasure. Every house in the village has been searched, as was Fraser himself, with no trace discovered of any gold. It is a remote district, and I am reasonably sure that he communicated with no one outside the prison prior to his escape\u2014I am positive that he has not done so since, for he is closely watched.</p><p>Grey stopped, seeing once more the windswept figure of James Fraser, wild as the red stags and as much at home on the moor as one of them.</p><p>He had not the slightest doubt that Fraser could have eluded the dragoons easily, had he so chosen, but he had not. He had deliberately allowed himself to be recaptured. Why? He resumed writing, more slowly.</p><p>It may be, of course, that Fraser failed to find the treasure, or that such a treasure does not exist. I find myself somewhat inclined to this belief, for if he were in possession of a great sum, surely he would have departed from the district at once? He is a strong man, well-accustomed to rough living, and entirely capable, I believe, of making his way overland to some point on the coast from which he might make an escape by sea.</p> <p>Grey bit the end of the quill gently, tasting ink. He made a face at the bitterness, rose, and spat out the window. He stood there for a minute, looking out into the cold spring night, absently wiping his mouth.</p><p>It had finally occurred to him to ask; not the question he had been asking all along, but the more important one. He had done it at the conclusion of a game of chess, which Fraser had won. The guard was standing at the door, ready to escort Fraser back to his cell; as the prisoner had risen from his seat, Grey had stood up, too.</p><p>\u201cI shall not ask you again why you left the prison,\u201d he had said, calmly conversational. \u201cBut I will ask you\u2014why did you come back?\u201d</p><p>Fraser had frozen briefly, startled. He turned back and met Grey\u2019s eyes directly. For a moment he said nothing. Then his mouth curled up in a smile.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I must value the company, Major; I can tell ye, it\u2019s not the food.\u201d</p> <p>Grey snorted slightly, remembering. Unable to think of a suitable response, he had allowed Fraser to leave. It was only later that night that he had laboriously arrived at an answer, at last having had the wit to ask questions of himself, rather than of Fraser. What would he, Grey, have done, had Fraser not returned?</p><p>The answer was that his next step would have been an inquiry into Fraser\u2019s family connections, in case the man had sought refuge or help from them.</p><p>And that, he was fairly sure, was the answer. Grey had not taken part in the subjugation of the Highlands\u2014he had been posted to Italy and France\u2014but he had heard more than enough of that particular campaign. He had seen the blackened stones of too many charred cottages, rising like cairns amid the ruined fields, as he traveled north to Ardsmuir.</p><p>The fierce loyalties of the Scottish Highlanders were legendary. A Highlander who had seen those cots in flames might well choose to suffer prison, irons, or even flogging, to save his family a visitation from English soldiers.</p><p>Grey sat and took up his quill, dipping it afresh.</p><p>You will know, I think, the mettle of the Scots, he wrote. That one in particular, he thought wryly.</p> <p>It is unlikely that any force or threat I can exert will induce Fraser to reveal the whereabouts of the gold\u2014should it exist, and if it does not, I can still less expect any threat to be effective! I have instead chosen to begin a formal acquaintance with Fraser, in his capacity as chief of the Scottish prisoners, in hopes of surprising some clue from his conversation. So far, I have gained nothing from this process. One further avenue of approach suggests itself, however.</p><p>For obvious reasons, he went on, writing slowly as he formed the thought, I do not wish to make this matter known officially. To call attention to a hoard that might well prove to be chimerical was dangerous; the chance of disappointment was too great. Time enough, if the gold were found, to inform his superiors and collect his deserved reward\u2014escape from Ardsmuir; a posting back to civilization.</p><p>Therefore I approach you, dear brother, and ask for your help in discovering what particulars may obtain regarding the family of James Fraser. I pray you, do not let anyone be alarmed by your inquiries; if such family connections exist, I would have them ignorant of my interest for the present. My deepest thanks for any efforts you may be able to exert on my behalf, and believe me always,</p><p>He dipped the pen once more and signed with a small flourish,</p><p>Your humble servant and most affectionate brother,</p><p>John William Grey.</p><p>May 15, 1755</p><p>\u201cThe men sick of la grippe,\u201d Grey inquired, \u201chow do they fare?\u201d Dinner was over, and with it their conversation of books. Now it was time for business.</p> <p>Fraser frowned over the single glass of sherry that was all he would accept in the way of drink. He still had not tasted it, though dinner had been over for some time.</p><p>\u201cNone so well. I have more than sixty men ill, fifteen of them verra badly off.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cMight I ask...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can promise nothing, Mr. Fraser, but you may ask,\u201d Grey answered formally. He had barely sipped his own sherry, nor more than tasted his dinner; his stomach had been knotted with anticipation all day.</p><p>Jamie paused a moment longer, calculating his chances. He wouldn\u2019t get everything; he must try for what was most important, but leave Grey room to reject some requests.</p><p>\u201cWe have need of more blankets, Major, more fires, and more food. And medicines.\u201d</p><p>Grey swirled the sherry in his cup, watching the light from the fire play in the vortex. Ordinary business first, he reminded himself. Time enough for the other, later.</p><p>\u201cWe have no more than twenty spare blankets in store,\u201d he answered, \u201cbut you may have those for the use of the very sick. I fear I cannot augment the ration of food; the rat-spoilage has been considerable, and we lost a great quantity of meal in the collapse of the storeroom two months ago. We have limited resources, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not so much a question of more,\u201d Fraser put in quickly. \u201cBut rather of the type of food. Those who are most ill cannot readily digest the bread and parritch. Perhaps a substitution of some sort might be arranged?\u201d Each man was given, by law, a quart of oatmeal parritch and a small wheaten loaf each day. Thin barley brose supplemented this twice each week, with a quart of meat stew added on Sunday, to sustain the needs of men working at manual labor for twelve to sixteen hours per day.</p><p>Grey raised one eyebrow. \u201cWhat are you suggesting, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume that the prison does have some allowance for the purchase of salt beef, turnips and onions, for the Sunday stew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that allowance must provide for the next quarter\u2019s supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what I suggest, Major, is that you might use that money now to provide broth and stew for those who are sick. Those of us who are hale will willingly forgo our share of meat for the quarter.\u201d</p><p>Grey frowned. \u201cBut will the prisoners not be weakened, with no meat at all? Will they not be unable to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose who die of the grippe will assuredly not work,\u201d Fraser pointed out acerbically.</p><p>Grey snorted briefly. \u201cTrue. But those of you who remain healthy will not be healthy long, if you give up your rations for so long a time.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, Mr. Fraser, I think not. It is better to let the sick take their chances than to risk many more falling ill.\u201d</p><p>Fraser was a stubborn man. He lowered his head for a moment, then looked up to try again.</p><p>\u201cThen I would ask your leave to hunt for ourselves, Major, if the Crown cannot supply us with adequate food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunt?\u201d Grey\u2019s fair brows rose in astonishment. \u201cGive you weapons and allow you to wander the moors? God\u2019s teeth, Mr. Fraser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think God doesna suffer much from the scurvy, Major,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cHis teeth are in no danger.\u201d He saw the twitch of Grey\u2019s mouth and relaxed slightly. Grey always tried to suppress his sense of humor, no doubt feeling that put him at a disadvantage. In his dealings with Jamie Fraser, it did.</p><p>Emboldened by that telltale twitch, Jamie pressed on.</p><p>\u201cNot weapons, Major. And not wandering. Will ye give us leave to set snares upon the moor when we cut peats, though? And to keep such meat as we take?\u201d A prisoner would now and then contrive a snare as it was, but as often as not, the catch would be taken from him by the guards.</p><p>Grey drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly, considering.</p><p>\u201cSnares? Would you not require materials for the construction of these snares, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a bit of string, Major,\u201d Jamie assured him. \u201cA dozen balls, no more, of any sort of twine or string, and ye may leave the rest to us.\u201d</p><p>Grey rubbed slowly at his cheek in contemplation, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d The Major turned to the small secretary, plucked the quill out of its inkwell and made a note. \u201cI shall give orders to that effect tomorrow. Now, as to the rest of your requests...\u201d</p><p>A quarter-hour later, it was settled. Jamie sat back at last, sighing, and finally took a sip of his sherry. He considered that he had earned it.</p><p>He had permission not only for the snares, but for the peat-cutters to work an extra half-hour per day, the extra peats to provide for an additional small fire in each cell. No medicines were to be had, but he had leave for Sutherland to send a message to a cousin in Ullapool, whose husband was an apothecary. If the cousin\u2019s husband were willing to send medicines, the prisoners could have them.</p><p>A decent evening\u2019s work, Jamie thought. He took another sip of sherry and closed his eyes, enjoying the warmth of the fire against his cheek.</p><p>Grey watched his guest beneath lowered lids, seeing the broad shoulders slump a little, tension eased now that their business was finished. Or so Fraser thought. Very good, Grey thought to himself. Yes, drink your sherry and relax. I want you thoroughly off guard.</p><p>He leaned forward to pick up the decanter, and felt the crackle of Hal\u2019s letter in his breast pocket. His heart began to beat faster.</p><p>\u201cWill you not take a drop more, Mr. Fraser? And tell me\u2014how does your sister fare these days?\u201d</p><p>He saw Fraser\u2019s eyes spring open, and his face whiten with shock.</p><p>\u201cHow are matters there at\u2014Lallybroch, they call it, do they not?\u201d Grey pushed aside the decanter, keeping his eyes fixed on his guest.</p><p>\u201cI could not say, Major.\u201d Fraser\u2019s voice was even, but his eyes were narrowed to slits.</p><p>\u201cNo? But I daresay they do very well these days, what with the gold you have provided them.\u201d</p><p>The broad shoulders tightened suddenly, bunched under the shabby coat. Grey carelessly picked up one of the chessmen from the nearby board, tossing it casually from one hand to the other.</p><p>\u201cI suppose Ian\u2014your brother-in-law is named Ian, I think?\u2014will know how to make good use of it.\u201d</p><p>Fraser had himself under control again. The dark blue eyes met Grey\u2019s directly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince you are so well informed as to my connections, Major,\u201d he said evenly, \u201cI must suppose that you also are aware that my home lies well over a hundred miles from Ardsmuir. Perhaps you will explain how I might have traveled that distance twice within the space of three days?\u201d</p><p>Grey\u2019s eyes stayed on the chess piece, rolling idly from hand to hand. It was a pawn, a cone-headed little warrior with a fierce face, carved from a cylinder of walrus ivory.</p><p>\u201cYou might have met someone upon the moor who would have borne word of the gold\u2014or borne the gold itself\u2014to your family.\u201d</p><p>Fraser snorted briefly.</p> <p>\u201cOn Ardsmuir? How likely is it, Major, that I should by happenstance encounter a person known to me on that moor? Much less that it should be a person whom I would trust to convey a message such as you suggest?\u201d He set down his glass with finality. \u201cI met no one on the moor, Major.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd should I trust your word to that effect, Mr. Fraser?\u201d Grey allowed considerable skepticism to show in his voice. He glanced up, brows raised. Fraser\u2019s high cheekbones flushed slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo one has ever had cause to doubt my word, Major,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cHave they not, indeed?\u201d Grey was not altogether feigning his anger. \u201cI believe you gave me your word, upon the occasion of my ordering your irons stricken off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I kept it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d The two men sat upright, glaring at each other over the table.</p><p>\u201cYou asked three things of me, Major, and I have kept that bargain in every particular!\u201d</p><p>Grey gave a contemptuous snort.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Mr. Fraser? And if that is so, pray what was it caused you suddenly to despise the company of your fellows and seek congress with the coneys on the moor? Since you assure me that you met no one else\u2014you give me your word that it is so.\u201d This last was spoken with an audible sneer that brought the color surging into Fraser\u2019s face.</p><p>One of the big hands curled slowly into a fist.</p><p>\u201cAye, Major,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI give ye my word that that is so.\u201d He seemed to realize at this point that his fist was clenched; very slowly, he unfolded it, laying his hand flat on the table.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as to your escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as to my escape, Major, I have told you that I will say nothing.\u201d Fraser exhaled slowly and sat back in his chair, eyes fixed on Grey under thick, ruddy brows.</p><p>Grey paused for a moment, then sat back himself, setting the chess piece on the table.</p><p>\u201cLet me speak plainly, Mr. Fraser. I do you the honor of assuming you to be a sensible man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am deeply sensible of the honor, Major, I do assure you.\u201d</p><p>Grey heard the irony, but did not respond; he held the upper hand now.</p><p>\u201cThe fact is, Mr. Fraser, that it is of no consequence whether you did in fact communicate with your family regarding the matter of the gold. You might have done so. That possibility alone is sufficient to warrant my sending a party of dragoons to search the premises of Lallybroch\u2014thoroughly\u2014and to arrest and interrogate the members of your family.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his breast pocket and withdrew a piece of paper. Unfolding it, he read the list of names.</p> <p>\u201cIan Murray\u2014your brother-in-law, I collect? His wife, Janet. That would be your sister, of course. Their children, James\u2014named for his uncle, perhaps?\u201d\u2014he glanced up briefly, long enough to catch a glimpse of Fraser\u2019s face, than returned to his list\u2014\u201cMargaret, Katherine, Janet, Michael, and Ian. Quite a brood,\u201d he said, in a tone of dismissal that equated the six younger Murrays with a litter of piglets. He laid the list on the table beside the chess piece.</p><p>\u201cThe three eldest children are old enough to be arrested and interrogated with their parents, you know. Such interrogations are frequently ungentle, Mr. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>In this, he spoke no less than the truth, and Fraser knew it. All color had faded from the prisoner\u2019s face, leaving the strong bones stark under the skin. He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them.</p><p>Grey had a brief memory of Quarry\u2019s voice, saying \u201cIf you dine alone with the man, don\u2019t turn your back on him.\u201d The hair rose briefly on the back of his neck, but he controlled himself, returning Fraser\u2019s blue stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d The voice was low, and hoarse with fury, but the Scot sat motionless, a figure carved in cinnabar, gilded by the flame.</p><p>Grey took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI want the truth,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>There was no sound in the chamber save the pop and hiss of the peats in the grate. There was a flicker of movement from Fraser, no more than the twitch of his fingers against his leg, and then nothing. The Scot sat, head turned, staring into the fire as though he sought an answer there.</p><p>Grey sat quietly, waiting. He could afford to wait. At last, Fraser turned back to face him.</p><p>\u201cThe truth, then.\u201d He took a deep breath; Grey could see the breast of his linen shirt swell with it\u2014he had no waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cI kept my word, Major. I told ye faithfully all that the man said to me that night. What I didna tell ye was that some of what he said had meaning to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Grey held himself still, scarcely daring to move. \u201cAnd what meaning was that?\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s wide mouth compressed to a thin line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014spoke to you of my wife,\u201d he said, forcing the words out as though they hurt him.</p><p>\u201cYes, you said that she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that she was gone, Major,\u201d Fraser corrected softly. His eyes were fixed on the pawn. \u201cIt is likely she is dead, but\u2014\u201d He stopped and swallowed, then went on more firmly.</p><p>\u201cMy wife was a healer. What they call in the Highlands a charmer, but more than that. She was a white lady\u2014a wisewoman.\u201d He glanced up briefly. \u201cThe word in Gaelic is ban-druidh; it also means witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe white witch.\u201d Grey also spoke softly, but excitement was thrumming through his blood. \u201cSo the man\u2019s words referred to your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they might. And if so\u2014\u201d The wide shoulders stirred in a slight shrug. \u201cI had to go,\u201d he said simply. \u201cTo see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where to go? Was that also something you gleaned from the vagrant\u2019s words?\u201d Grey leaned forward slightly, curious. Fraser nodded, eyes still fixed on the ivory chess piece.</p><p>\u201cThere is a spot I knew of, not too far distant from this place, where there is a shrine to St. Bride. St. Bride was also called \u2018the white lady,\u2019\u201d he explained, looking up. \u201cThough the shrine has been there a verra long time\u2014since long before St. Bride came to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And so you assumed that the man\u2019s words referred to this spot, as well as to your wife?\u201d</p><p>Again the shrug.</p><p>\u201cI did not know,\u201d Fraser repeated. \u201cI couldna say whether he meant anything to do with my wife, or whether \u2018the white witch\u2019 only meant St. Bride\u2014was only meant to direct me to the place\u2014or perhaps neither. But I felt I must go.\u201d</p><p>He described the place in question, and at Grey\u2019s prodding, gave directions for reaching it.</p><p>\u201cThe shrine itself is a small stone in the shape of an ancient cross, so weathered that the markings scarce show on it. It stands above a small pool, half-buried in the heather. Ye can find small white stones in the pool, tangled among the roots of the heather that grows on the bank. The stones are thought to have great powers, Major,\u201d he explained, seeing the other\u2019s blank look. \u201cBut only when used by a white lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. And your wife...?\u201d Grey paused delicately.</p><p>Fraser shook his head briefly.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing there to do with her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShe is truly gone.\u201d His voice was low and controlled, but Grey could hear the undertone of desolation.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s face was normally calm and unreadable; he did not change expression now, but the marks of grief were clear, etched in the lines beside mouth and eyes, thrown into darkness by the flickering fire. It seemed an intrusion to break in upon such a depth of feeling, unstated though it was, but Grey had his duty.</p><p>\u201cAnd the gold, Mr. Fraser?\u201d he asked quietly. \u201cWhat of that?\u201d</p><p>Fraser heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt was there,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Grey sat bolt upright in his chair, staring at the Scot. \u201cYou found it?\u201d</p><p>Fraser glanced up at him then, and his mouth twisted wryly.</p><p>\u201cI found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it indeed the French gold that Louis sent for Charles Stuart?\u201d Excitement was racing through Grey\u2019s bloodstream, with visions of himself delivering great chests of gold louis d\u2019or to his superiors in London.</p><p>\u201cLouis never sent gold to the Stuarts,\u201d Fraser said, with certainty. \u201cNo, Major, what I found at the saint\u2019s pool was gold, but not French coin.\u201d</p><p>What he had found was a small box, containing a few gold and silver coins, and a small leather pouch, filled with jewels.</p><p>\u201cJewels?\u201d Grey blurted. \u201cWhere the devil did they come from?\u201d</p><p>Fraser cast him a glance of mild exasperation.</p><p>\u201cI havena the slightest notion, Major,\u201d he said. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Grey said, coughing to cover his flusterment. \u201cCertainly. But this treasure\u2014where is it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw it into the sea.\u201d</p><p>Grey stared blankly at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw it into the sea,\u201d Fraser repeated patiently. The slanted blue eyes met Grey\u2019s steadily. \u201cYe\u2019ll maybe have heard of a place called the Devil\u2019s Cauldron, Major? It\u2019s no more than half a mile from the saint\u2019s pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would you have done such a thing?\u201d Grey demanded. \u201cIt isn\u2019t sense, man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasna much concerned with sense at the time, Major,\u201d Fraser said softly. \u201cI had gone there hoping\u2014and with that hope gone, the treasure seemed no more to me than a wee box of stones and bits of tarnished metal. I had no use for it.\u201d He looked up, one brow slightly raised in irony. \u201cBut I didna see the \u2018sense\u2019 in giving it to King Geordie, either. So I flung it into the sea.\u201d</p><p>Grey sat back in his chair and mechanically poured out another cup of sherry, hardly noticing what he was doing. His thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p>Fraser sat, head turned away and chin propped on his fist, gazing into the fire, his face gone back to its usual impassivity. The light glowed behind him, lighting the long, straight line of his nose and the soft curve of his lip, shadowing jaw and brow with sternness.</p><p>Grey took a good-sized swallow of his drink and steadied himself.</p><p>\u201cIt is a moving story, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said levelly. \u201cMost dramatic. And yet there is no evidence that it is the truth.\u201d</p><p>Fraser stirred, turning his head to look at Grey. Jamie\u2019s slanted eyes narrowed, in what might have been amusement.</p><p>\u201cAye, there is, Major,\u201d he said. He reached under the waistband of his ragged breeches, fumbled for a moment, and held out his hand above the tabletop, waiting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grey extended his own hand in reflex, and a small object dropped into his open palm.</p><p>It was a sapphire, dark blue as Fraser\u2019s own eyes, and a good size, too.</p><p>Grey opened his mouth, but said nothing, choked with astonishment.</p><p>\u201cThere is your evidence that the treasure existed, Major.\u201d Fraser nodded toward the stone in Grey\u2019s hand. His eyes met Grey\u2019s across the tabletop. \u201cAnd as for the rest\u2014I am sorry to say, Major, that ye must take my word for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Fraser was as calm as though they had been discussing the rain outside. \u201cI kept that one wee stone, thinking that it might be some use, if I were ever to be freed, or that I might find some chance of sending it to my family. For ye\u2019ll appreciate, Major\u201d\u2014a light glinted derisively in Jamie\u2019s blue eyes\u2014\u201cthat my family couldna make use of a treasure of that sort, without attracting a deal of unwelcome attention. One stone, perhaps, but not a great many of them.\u201d</p><p>Grey could scarcely think. What Fraser said was true; a Highland farmer like his brother-in-law would have no way of turning such a treasure into money without causing talk that would bring down the King\u2019s men on Lallybroch in short order. And Fraser himself might well be imprisoned for the rest of his life. But still, to toss away a fortune so lightly! And yet, looking at the Scot, he could well believe it. If ever there was a man whose judgment would not be distorted by greed, James Fraser was it. Still\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow did you keep this by you?\u201d Grey demanded abruptly. \u201cYou were searched to the skin when you were brought back.\u201d</p><p>The wide mouth curved slightly in the first genuine smile Grey had seen.</p> <p>\u201cI swallowed it,\u201d Fraser said.</p><p>Grey\u2019s hand closed convulsively on the sapphire. He opened his hand and rather gingerly set the gleaming blue thing on the table by the chess piece.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure ye do, Major,\u201d said Fraser, with a gravity that merely made the glint of amusement in his eyes more pronounced. \u201cA diet of rough parritch has its advantages, now and again.\u201d</p><p>Grey quelled the sudden urge to laugh, rubbing a finger hard over his lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does, Mr. Fraser.\u201d He sat for a moment, contemplating the blue stone. Then he looked up abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cYou are a Papist, Mr. Fraser?\u201d He knew the answer already; there were few adherents of the Catholic Stuarts who were not. Without waiting for a reply, he rose and went to the bookshelf in the corner. It took a moment to find; a gift from his mother, it was not part of his usual reading.</p><p>He laid the calf-bound Bible on the table, next to the stone.</p><p>\u201cI am myself inclined to accept your word as a gentleman, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you will understand that I have my duty to consider.\u201d</p><p>Fraser gazed at the book for a long moment, then looked up at Grey, his expression unreadable.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken that fine, Major,\u201d he said quietly. Without hesitation, he laid a broad hand on the Bible.</p><p>\u201cI swear in the name of Almighty God and by His Holy Word,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThe treasure is as I told you.\u201d His eyes glowed in the firelight, dark and unfathomable. \u201cAnd I swear on my hope of heaven,\u201d he added softly, \u201cthat it rests now in the sea.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>THE TORREMOLINOS GAMBIT</p> <p>With the question of the French gold thus settled, they returned to what had become their routine; a brief period of formal negotiation over the affairs of the prisoners, followed by informal conversation and sometimes a game of chess. This evening, they had come from the dinner table, still discussing Samuel Richardson\u2019s immense novel Pamela.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that the size of the book is justified by the complexity of the story?\u201d Grey asked, leaning forward to light a cheroot from the candle on the sideboard. \u201cIt must after all be a great expense to the publisher, as well as requiring a substantial effort from the reader, a book of that length.\u201d</p><p>Fraser smiled. He did not smoke himself, but had chosen to drink port this evening, claiming that to be the only drink whose taste would be unaffected by the stink of tobacco.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it\u2014twelve hundred pages? Aye, I think so. After all, it is difficult to sum up the complications of a life in a short space with any hope of constructing an accurate account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I have heard the point made, though, that the novelist\u2019s skill lies in the artful selection of detail. Do you not suppose that a volume of such length may indicate a lack of discipline in such selection, and hence a lack of skill?\u201d</p><p>Fraser considered, sipping the ruby liquid slowly.</p><p>\u201cI have seen books where that is the case, to be sure,\u201d he said. \u201cAn author seeks by sheer inundation of detail to overwhelm the reader into belief. In this case, however, I think it isna so. Each character is most carefully considered, and all the incidents chosen seem necessary to the story. No, I think it is true that some stories simply require a greater space in which to be told.\u201d He took another sip and laughed.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I admit to some prejudice in that regard, Major. Given the circumstances under which I read Pamela, I should have been delighted had the book been twice as long as it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what circumstances were those?\u201d Grey pursed his lips and blew a careful smoke ring that floated toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI lived in a cave in the Highlands for several years, Major,\u201d Fraser said wryly. \u201cI seldom had more than three books with me, and those must last me for months at a time. Aye, I\u2019m partial to lengthy tomes, but I must admit that it is not a universal preference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly true,\u201d Grey agreed. He squinted, following the track of the first smoke ring, and blew another. Just off target, it drifted to the side.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he continued, sucking fiercely on his cheroot, encouraging it to draw, \u201ca friend of my mother\u2019s\u2014saw the book\u2014in Mother\u2019s drawing room\u2014\u201d He drew deeply, and blew once more, giving a small grunt of satisfaction as the new ring struck the old, dispersing it into a tiny cloud.</p><p>\u201cLady Hensley, it was. She picked up the book, looked at it in that helpless way so many females affect and said, \u2018Oh, Countess! You are so courageous to attack a novel of such stupendous size. I fear I should never dare to start so lengthy a book myself.\u2019\u201d Grey cleared his throat and lowered his voice from the falsetto he had affected for Lady Hensley.</p><p>\u201cTo which Mother replied,\u201d he went on in his normal voice, \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t worry about it for a moment, my dear; you wouldn\u2019t understand it anyway.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Fraser laughed, then coughed, waving away the remnants of another smoke ring.</p><p>Grey quickly snuffed out the cheroot, and rose from his seat.</p><p>\u201cCome along then; we\u2019ve just time for a quick game.\u201d</p><p>They were not evenly matched; Fraser was much the better player, but Grey could now and then contrive to rescue a match through sheer bravado of play.</p><p>Tonight, he tried the Torremolinos Gambit. It was a risky opening, a queen\u2019s knight opening. Successfully launched, it paved the way for an unusual combination of rook and bishop, depending for its success upon a piece of misdirection by the king\u2019s knight and king bishop\u2019s pawn. Grey used it seldom, for it was a trick that would not work on a mediocre player, one not sharp enough to detect the knight\u2019s threat, or its possibilities. It was a gambit for use against a shrewd and subtle mind, and after nearly three months of weekly games, Grey knew quite well what sort of mind he was facing across the tinted ivory squares.</p><p>He forced himself not to hold his breath as he made the next-to-final move of the combination. He felt Fraser\u2019s eyes rest on him briefly, but didn\u2019t meet them, for fear of betraying his excitement. Instead, he reached to the sideboard for the decanter, and refilled both glasses with the sweet dark port, keeping his eyes carefully on the rising liquid.</p><p>Would it be the pawn, or the knight? Fraser\u2019s head was bent over the board in contemplation, small reddish lights winking in his hair as he moved slightly. The knight, and all was well; it would be too late. The pawn, and all was likely lost.</p><p>Grey could feel his heart beating heavily behind his breastbone as he waited. Fraser\u2019s hand hovered over the board, then suddenly decided, swooped down and touched the piece. The knight.</p><p>He must have let his breath out too noisily, for Fraser glanced sharply up at him, but it was too late. Careful to keep any overt expression of triumph off his face, Grey castled.</p><p>Fraser frowned at the board for a long moment, eyes flicking among the pieces, assessing. Then he jerked slightly, seeing it, and looked up, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWhy ye cunning wee bastard!\u201d he said, in a tone of surprised respect. \u201cWhere in the bloody hell did ye learn that trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy elder brother taught it to me,\u201d Grey answered, losing his customary wariness in a rush of delight at his success. He normally beat Fraser no more than three times in ten, and victory was sweet.</p><p>Fraser uttered a short laugh, and reaching out a long index finger, delicately tipped his king over.</p><p>\u201cI should have expected something like that from a man like my Lord Melton,\u201d he observed casually.</p><p>Grey stiffened in his seat. Fraser saw the movement, and arched one brow quizzically.</p><p>\u201cIt is Lord Melton ye mean, is it not?\u201d he said. \u201cOr perhaps you have another brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grey said. His lips felt slightly numb, though that might only be the cheroot. \u201cNo, I have only one brother.\u201d His heart had begun to pound again, but this time with a heavy, dull beat. Had the Scottish bastard remembered all the time who he was?</p><p>\u201cOur meeting was necessarily rather brief,\u201d the Scot said dryly. \u201cBut memorable.\u201d He picked up his glass and took a drink, watching Grey across the crystal rim. \u201cPerhaps ye didna know that I had met Lord Melton, on Culloden Field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew. I fought at Culloden.\u201d All Grey\u2019s pleasure in his victory had evaporated. He felt slightly nauseated from the smoke. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you would recall Hal, though\u2014or know of the relationship between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I have that meeting to thank for my life, I am not likely to forget it,\u201d Fraser said dryly.</p><p>Grey looked up. \u201cI understand that you were not so thankful when Hal met you at Culloden.\u201d</p><p>The line of Fraser\u2019s mouth tightened, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. He smiled without humor. \u201cYour brother verra stubbornly refused to shoot me. I wasna inclined to be grateful for the favor at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wished to be shot?\u201d Grey\u2019s eyebrows rose.</p><p>The Scot\u2019s eyes were remote, fixed on the chessboard, but clearly seeing something else.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had reason,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAt the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reason?\u201d Grey asked. He caught a gimlet glance and added hastily, \u201cI mean no impertinence in asking. It is only\u2014at that time, I\u2014I felt similarly. From what you have said of the Stuarts, I cannot think that the loss of their cause would have led you to such despair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a faint flicker near Fraser\u2019s mouth, much too faint to be called a smile. He inclined his head briefly, in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cThere were those who fought for love of Charles Stuart\u2014or from loyalty to his father\u2019s right of kingship. But you are right; I wasna one of those.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t explain further. Grey took a deep breath, keeping his eyes fixed on the board.</p><p>\u201cI said that I felt much as you did, at the time. I\u2014lost a particular friend at Culloden,\u201d he said. With half his mind he wondered why he should speak of Hector to this man, of all men; a Scottish warrior who had slashed his way across that deadly field, whose sword might well have been the one...At the same time, he could not help but speak; there was no one to whom he could speak of Hector, save this man, this prisoner who could speak to no one else, whose words could do him no damage.</p> <p>\u201cHe made me go and look at the body\u2014Hal did, my brother,\u201d Grey blurted. He looked down at his hand, where the deep blue of Hector\u2019s sapphire burned against his skin, a smaller version of the one Fraser had reluctantly given him.</p><p>\u201cHe said that I must; that unless I saw him dead, I should never really believe it. That unless I knew Hector\u2014my friend\u2014was really gone, I would grieve forever. If I saw, and knew, I would grieve, but then I should heal\u2014and forget.\u201d He looked up, with a painful attempt at a smile. \u201cHal is generally right, but not always.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he had healed, but he would never forget. Certainly he would not forget his last sight of Hector, lying wax-faced and still in the early morning light, long dark lashes resting delicately on his cheeks as they did when he slept. And the gaping wound that had half-severed his head from his body, leaving the windpipe and large vessels of the neck exposed in butchery.</p><p>They sat silent for a moment. Fraser said nothing, but picked up his glass and drained it. Without asking, Grey refilled both glasses for the third time.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, looking curiously at his guest.</p> <p>\u201cDo you find your life greatly burdensome, Mr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>The Scot looked up then, and met his eyes with a long, level gaze. Evidently, Fraser found nothing in his own face save curiosity, for the broad shoulders across the board relaxed their tension somewhat, and the wide mouth softened its grim line. The Scot leaned back, and flexed his right hand slowly, opening and closing it to stretch the muscles. Grey saw that the hand had been damaged at one time; small scars were visible in the firelight, and two of the fingers were set stiffly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not greatly so,\u201d the Scot replied slowly. He met Grey\u2019s eyes with dispassion. \u201cI think perhaps the greatest burden lies in caring for those we cannot help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in having no one for whom to care?\u201d</p><p>Fraser paused before answering; he might have been weighing the position of the pieces on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat is emptiness,\u201d he said at last, softly. \u201cBut no great burden.\u201d</p> <p>It was late; there was no sound from the fortress around them save the occasional step of the soldier on sentry in the courtyard below.</p><p>\u201cYour wife\u2014she was a healer, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was. She...her name was Claire.\u201d Fraser swallowed, then lifted his cup and drank, as though trying to dislodge something stuck in his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou cared very much for her, I think?\u201d Grey said softly.</p><p>He recognized in the Scot the same compulsion he had had a few moments earlier\u2014the need to speak a name kept hidden, to bring back for a moment the ghost of a love.</p><p>\u201cI had meant to thank you sometime, Major,\u201d the Scot said softly.</p><p>Grey was startled.</p><p>\u201cThank me? For what?\u201d</p> <p>The Scot looked up, eyes dark over the finished game.</p><p>\u201cFor that night at Carryarrick where we first met.\u201d His eyes were steady on Grey\u2019s. \u201cFor what ye did for my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remembered,\u201d Grey said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cI hadna forgotten,\u201d Fraser said simply. Grey steeled himself to look across the table, but when he did so, he found no hint of laughter in the slanted blue eyes.</p><p>Fraser nodded at him, gravely formal. \u201cYe were a worthy foe, Major; I wouldna forget you.\u201d</p><p>John Grey laughed bitterly. Oddly enough, he felt less upset than he had thought he would, at having the shameful memory so explicitly recalled.</p><p>\u201cIf you found a sixteen-year-old shitting himself with fear a worthy foe, Mr. Fraser, then it is little wonder that the Highland army was defeated!\u201d</p><p>Fraser smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cA man that doesna shit himself with a pistol held to his head, Major, has either no bowels, or no brains.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, Grey laughed. One edge of Fraser\u2019s mouth turned slightly up.</p><p>\u201cYe wouldna speak to save your own life, but ye would do it to save a lady\u2019s honor. The honor of my own lady,\u201d Fraser said softly. \u201cThat doesna seem like cowardice to me.\u201d</p><p>The ring of truth was too evident in the Scot\u2019s voice to mistake or ignore.</p><p>\u201cI did nothing for your wife,\u201d Grey said, rather bitterly. \u201cShe was in no danger, after all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe didna ken that, aye?\u201d Fraser pointed out. \u201cYe thought to save her life and virtue, at the risk of your own. Ye did her honor by the notion\u2014and I have thought of it now and again, since I\u2014since I lost her.\u201d The hesitation in Fraser\u2019s voice was slight; only the tightening of the muscles in his throat betrayed his emotion.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Grey breathed deep, and let it out slowly. \u201cI am sorry for your loss,\u201d he added formally.</p><p>They were both quiet for a moment, alone with their ghosts. Then Fraser looked up and drew in his breath.</p><p>\u201cYour brother was right, Major,\u201d he said. \u201cI thank ye, and I\u2019ll bid ye good e\u2019en.\u201d He rose, set down his cup and left the room.</p><p>It reminded him in some ways of his years in the cave, with his visits to the house, those oases of life and warmth in the desert of solitude. Here, it was the reverse, going from the crowded, cold squalor of the cells up to the Major\u2019s glowing suite, able for a few hours to stretch both mind and body, to relax in warmth and conversation and the abundance of food.</p><p>It gave him the same odd sense of dislocation, though; that sense of losing some valuable part of himself that could not survive the passage back to daily life. Each time, the passage became more difficult.</p><p>He stood in the drafty passageway, waiting for the turnkey to unlock the cell door. The sounds of sleeping men buzzed in his ears and the smell of them wafted out as the door opened, pungent as a fart.</p><p>He filled his lungs with a quick deep breath, and ducked his head to enter.</p><p>There was a stir among the bodies on the floor as he stepped into the room, his shadow falling black across the prone and bundled shapes. The door swung closed behind him, leaving the cell in darkness, but there was a ripple of awareness through the room, as men stirred awake to his coming.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back late, Mac Dubh,\u201d said Murdo Lindsay, voice rusty with sleep. \u201cYe\u2019ll be sair tuckered tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage, Murdo,\u201d he whispered, stepping over bodies. He pulled off his coat and laid it carefully over the bench, then took up the rough blanket and sought his space on the floor, his long shadow flickering across the moon-barred window.</p><p>Ronnie Sinclair turned over as Mac Dubh lay down beside him. He blinked sleepily, sandy lashes nearly invisible in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cDid Wee Goldie feed ye decent, Mac Dubh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, Ronnie, thank ye.\u201d He shifted on the stones, seeking a comfortable position.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll tell us about it tomorrow?\u201d The prisoners took an odd pleasure in hearing what he had been served for dinner, taking it as an honor that their chief should be well fed.</p><p>\u201cAye, I will, Ronnie,\u201d Mac Dubh promised. \u201cBut I must sleep now, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep well, Mac Dubh,\u201d came a whisper from the corner where Hayes was rolled up, curled like a set of teaspoons with MacLeod, Innes, and Keith, who all liked to sleep warm.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, Gavin,\u201d Mac Dubh whispered back, and little by little, the cell settled back into silence.</p><p>He dreamed of Claire that night. She lay in his arms, heavy-limbed and fragrant. She was with child; her belly round and smooth as a muskmelon, her br**sts rich and full, the ni**les dark as wine, urging him to taste them.</p><p>Her hand cupped itself between his legs, and he reached to return the favor, the small, fat softness of her filling his hand, pressing against him as she moved. She rose over him, smiling, her hair falling down around her face, and threw her leg across him.</p><p>\u201cGive me your mouth,\u201d he whispered, not knowing whether he meant to kiss her or to have her take him between her lips, only knowing he must have her somehow.</p><p>\u201cGive me yours,\u201d she said. She laughed and leaned down to him, hands on his shoulders, her hair brushing his face with the scent of moss and sunlight, and he felt the prickle of dry leaves against his back and knew they lay in the glen near Lallybroch, and her the color of the copper beeches all around; beech leaves and beechwood, gold eyes and a smooth white skin, skimmed with shadows.</p><p>Then her breast pressed against his mouth, and he took it eagerly, drawing her body tight against him as he suckled her. Her milk was hot and sweet, with a faint taste of silver, like a deer\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she whispered to him, and put her hand behind his head, gripping the back of his neck, pressing him to her. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>She lay at her length upon him, his hands holding for dear life to the sweet flesh of her bu**ocks, feeling the small solid weight of the child upon his own belly, as though they shared it now, protecting the small round thing between their bodies.</p><p>He flung his arms about her, tight, and she held him tight as he jerked and shuddered, her hair in his face, her hands in his hair and the child between them, not knowing where any of the three of them began or ended.</p><p>He came awake suddenly, panting and sweating, half-curled on his side beneath one of the benches in the cell. It was not yet quite light, but he could see the shapes of the men who lay near him, and hoped he had not cried out. He closed his eyes at once, but the dream was gone. He lay quite still, his heart slowing, and waited for the dawn.</p><p>June 18, 1755</p><p>John Grey had dressed carefully this evening, with fresh linen and silk stockings. He wore his own hair, simply plaited, rinsed with a tonic of lemon-verbena. He had hesitated for a moment over Hector\u2019s ring, but at last had put it on, too. The dinner had been good; a pheasant he had shot himself, and a salad of greens, in deference to Fraser\u2019s odd tastes for such things. Now they sat over the chessboard, lighter topics of conversation set aside in the concentration of the midgame.</p><p>\u201cWill you have sherry?\u201d He set down his bishop, and leaned back, stretching.</p><p>Fraser nodded, absorbed in the new position.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye.\u201d</p><p>Grey rose and crossed the room, leaving Fraser by the fire. He reached into the cupboard for the bottle, and felt a thin trickle of sweat run down his ribs as he did so. Not from the fire, simmering across the room; from sheer nervousness.</p><p>He brought the bottle back to the table, holding the goblets in his other hand; the Waterford crystal his mother had sent. The liquid purled into the glasses, shimmering amber and rose in the firelight. Fraser\u2019s eyes were fixed on the cup, watching the rising sherry, but with an abstraction that showed he was deep in his thoughts. The dark blue eyes were hooded. Grey wondered what he was thinking; not about the game\u2014the outcome of that was certain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grey reached out and moved his queen\u2019s bishop. It was no more than a delaying move, he knew; still, it put Fraser\u2019s queen in danger, and might force the exchange of a rook.</p><p>Grey got up to put a brick of peat on the fire. Rising, he stretched himself, and strolled behind his opponent to view the situation from this angle.</p><p>The firelight shimmered as the big Scot leaned forward to study the board, picking up the deep red tones of James Fraser\u2019s hair, echoing the glow of the light in the crystalline sherry.</p><p>Fraser had bound his hair back with a thin black cord, tied in a bow. It would take no more than a slight tug to loosen it. John Grey could imagine running his hand up under that thick, glossy mass, to touch the smooth, warm nape beneath. To touch...</p> <p>His palm closed abruptly, imagining sensation.</p><p>\u201cIt is your move, Major.\u201d The soft Scots voice brought him to himself again, and he took his seat, viewing the chessboard through sightless eyes.</p><p>Without really looking, he was intensely aware of the other\u2019s movements, his presence. There was a disturbance of the air around Fraser; it was impossible not to look at him. To cover his glance, he picked up his sherry glass and sipped, barely noticing the liquid gold taste of it.</p><p>Fraser sat still as a statue of cinnabar, only the deep blue eyes alive in his face as he studied the board. The fire had burned down, and the lines of his body were limned with shadow. His hand, all gold and black with the light of the fire on it, rested on the table, still and exquisite as the captured pawn beside it.</p><p>The blue stone in John Grey\u2019s ring glinted as he reached for his queen\u2019s bishop. Is it wrong, Hector? he thought. That I should love a man who might have killed you? Or was it a way at last to put things right; to heal the wounds of Culloden for them both?</p> <p>The bishop made a soft thump as he set the felted base down with precision. Without stopping, his hand rose, as though it moved without his volition. The hand traveled the short distance through the air, looking as though it knew precisely what it wanted, and set itself on Fraser\u2019s, palm tingling, curved fingers gently imploring.</p><p>The hand under his was warm\u2014so warm\u2014but hard, and motionless as marble. Nothing moved on the table but the shimmer of the flame in the heart of the sherry. He lifted his eyes then, to meet Fraser\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTake your hand off me,\u201d Fraser said, very, very softly. \u201cOr I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>The hand under Grey\u2019s did not move, nor did the face above, but he could feel the shiver of revulsion, a spasm of hatred and disgust that rose from the man\u2019s core, radiating through his flesh.</p><p>Quite suddenly, he heard once more the memory of Quarry\u2019s warning, as clearly as though the man spoke in his ear this moment.</p><p>If you dine with him alone\u2014don\u2019t turn your back on him.</p> <p>There was no chance of that; he could not turn away. Could not even look away or blink, to break the dark blue gaze that held him frozen. Moving as slowly as though he stood atop an unexploded mine, he drew back his hand.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence, broken only by the rain\u2019s patter and the hissing of the peat fire, when neither of them seemed to breathe. Then Fraser rose without a sound, and left the room.</p><p>12</p><p>SACRIFICE</p><p>The rain of late November pattered down on the stones of the courtyard, and on the sullen rows of men, standing huddled under the downpour. The Redcoats who stood on guard over them didn\u2019t look much happier than the sodden prisoners.</p><p>Major Grey stood under the overhang of the roof, waiting. It wasn\u2019t the best weather for conducting a search and cleaning of the prisoners\u2019 cells, but at this time of year, it was futile to wait for good weather. And with more than two hundred prisoners in Ardsmuir, it was necessary to swab the cells at least monthly in order to prevent major outbreaks of illness.</p><p>The doors to the main cell block swung back, and a small file of prisoners emerged; the trustys who did the actual cleaning, closely watched by the guards. At the end of the line, Corporal Dunstable came out, his hands full of the small bits of contraband a search of this sort usually turned up.</p><p>\u201cThe usual rubbish, sir,\u201d he reported, dumping the collection of pitiful relics and anonymous junk onto the top of a cask that stood near the Major\u2019s elbow. \u201cJust this, you might take notice of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis\u201d was a small strip of cloth, perhaps six inches by four, in a green tartan check. Dunstable glanced quickly at the lines of standing prisoners, as if intending to catch someone in a telltale action.</p><p>Grey sighed, then straightened his shoulders. \u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d The possession of any Scottish tartan was strictly forbidden by the Diskilting Act that had likewise disarmed the Highlanders and prevented the wearing of their native dress. He stepped in front of the rows of men, as Corporal Dunstable gave a sharp shout to attract their attention.</p><p>\u201cWhose is this?\u201d The corporal raised the scrap high, and raised his voice as well. Grey glanced from the scrap of bright cloth to the row of prisoners, mentally ticking off the names, trying to match them to his imperfect knowledge of tartans. Even within a single clan, the patterns varied so wildly that a given pattern couldn\u2019t be assigned with any certainty, but there were general patterns of color and design.</p><p>MacAlester, Hayes, Innes, Graham, MacMurtry, MacKenzie, MacDonald...stop. MacKenzie. That one. It was more an officer\u2019s knowledge of men than any identification of the plaid with a particular clan that made him sure. MacKenzie was a young prisoner, and his face was a shade too controlled, too expressionless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours, MacKenzie. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d Grey demanded. He snatched the scrap of cloth from the corporal and thrust it under the young man\u2019s nose. The prisoner was white-faced under the blotches of dirt. His jaw was clamped hard, and he was breathing hard through his nose with a faint whistling sound.</p><p>Grey fixed the young man with a hard, triumphant stare. The young Scot had that core of implacable hate that they all had, but he hadn\u2019t managed to build the wall of stoic indifference that held it in. Grey could feel the fear building in the lad; another second and he would break.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d The voice was calm, almost bored, and spoke with such flat indifference that neither MacKenzie nor Grey registered it at once. They stood locked in each other\u2019s eyes, until a large hand reached over Angus MacKenzie\u2019s shoulder and gently plucked the scrap of cloth from the officer\u2019s hand.</p><p>John Grey stepped back, feeling the words like a blow in the pit of his stomach. MacKenzie forgotten, he lifted his eyes the several inches necessary to look Jamie Fraser in the face.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a Fraser tartan,\u201d he said, feeling the words force their way past wooden lips. His whole face felt numb, a fact for which he was dimly grateful; at least his expression couldn\u2019t betray him before the ranks of the watching prisoners.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s mouth widened slightly. Grey kept his gaze fastened on it, afraid to meet the dark blue eyes above.</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Fraser agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s MacKenzie. My mother\u2019s clan.\u201d</p><p>In some far-off corner of his mind, Grey stored away another tiny scrap of information with the small hoard of facts kept in the jeweled coffer labeled \u201cJamie\u201d\u2014his mother was a MacKenzie. He knew that was true, just as he knew that the tartan didn\u2019t belong to Fraser.</p><p>He heard his voice, cool and steady, saying \u201cPossession of clan tartans is illegal. You know the penalty, of course?\u201d</p><p>The wide mouth curled in a one-sided smile.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>There was a shifting and a muttering among the ranks of the prisoners; there was little actual movement, but Grey could feel the alignment changing, as though they were in fact drawing toward Fraser, circling him, embracing him. The circle had broken and re-formed, and he was alone outside it. Jamie Fraser had gone back to his own.</p><p>With an effort of will, Grey forced his gaze away from the soft, smooth lips, slightly chapped from exposure to sun and wind. The look in the eyes above them was what he had been afraid of; neither fear nor anger\u2014but indifference.</p><p>He motioned to a guard.</p><p>\u201cTake him.\u201d</p><p>Major John William Grey bent his head over the work on his desk, signing requisitions without reading them. He seldom worked so late at night, but there had not been time during the day, and the paperwork was piling up. The requisitions must be sent to London this week.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred pound wheat flowr,\u201d he wrote, trying to concentrate on the neatness of the black squiggles under his quill. The trouble with such routine paperwork was that it occupied his attention but not his mind, allowing memories of the day to creep in unawares.</p><p>\u201cSix hogsheds ale, for use of barracks.\u201d He set down the quill and rubbed his hands briskly together. He could still feel the chill that had settled in his bones in the courtyard that morning. There was a hot fire, but it didn\u2019t seem to be helping. He didn\u2019t go nearer; he had tried that once, and stood mesmerized, seeing the images of the afternoon in the flames, roused only when the cloth of his breeches began to scorch.</p><p>He picked up the quill and tried again to banish the sights of the courtyard from his mind.</p><p>It was better not to delay execution of sentences of this kind; the prisoners became restless and nervy in anticipation and there was considerable difficulty in controlling them. Executed at once, though, such discipline often had a salutary effect, showing the prisoners that retribution would be swift and dire, enhancing their respect for those who held their guardianship. Somehow John Grey suspected that this particular occasion had not much enhanced his prisoners\u2019 respect\u2014for him, at least.</p><p>Feeling little more than the trickle of ice water through his veins, he had given his orders, swift and composed, and they had been obeyed with equal competence.</p><p>The prisoners had been drawn up in ranks around the four sides of the courtyard square, with shorter lines of guards arranged facing them, bayonets fixed to the ready, to prevent any unseemly outbreak.</p><p>But there had been no outbreak, seemly or otherwise. The prisoners had waited in a chill silence in the light rain that misted the stones of the courtyard, with little sound other than the normal coughs and throat-clearings of any assemblage of men. It was the beginning of winter, and catarrh was almost as common a scourge in the barracks as it was in the damp cells.</p><p>He had stood watching impassively, hands folded behind his back, as the prisoner was led to the platform. Watched, feeling the rain seep into the shoulders of his coat and run in tiny rivulets down the neck of his shirt, as Jamie Fraser stood on the platform a yard away and stripped to the waist, moving without haste or hesitation, as though this were something he had done before, an accustomed task, of no importance in itself.</p><p>He had nodded to the two privates, who seized the prisoner\u2019s unresisting hands and raised them, binding them to the arms of the whipping post. They gagged him, and Fraser stood upright, the rain running down his raised arms, and down the deep seam of his backbone, to soak the thin cloth of his breeches.</p><p>Another nod, to the sergeant who held the charge sheet, and a small surge of annoyance as the gesture caused a cascade of collected rain from one side of his hat. He straightened his hat and sodden wig, and resumed his stance of authority in time to hear the charge and sentence read. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c...in contravention of the Diskilting Act, passed by His Majesty\u2019s Parliament, for which crime the sentence of sixty lashes shall be inflicted.\u201d</p><p>Grey glanced with professional detachment at the sergeant-farrier designated to give the punishment; this was not the first time for any of them. He didn\u2019t nod this time; the rain was still falling. A half-closing of the eyes instead, as he spoke the usual words:</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser, you will take your punishment.\u201d</p><p>And he stood, eyes front and steady, watching, and hearing the thud of the landing flails and the grunt of the prisoner\u2019s breath, forced past the gag by the blow.</p> <p>The man\u2019s muscles tightened in resistance to the pain. Again and again, until each separate muscle stood hard under the skin. His own muscles ached with tension, and he shifted inconspicuously from one leg to another, as the brutal tedium continued. Thin streams of red ran down the prisoner\u2019s spine, blood mixed with water, staining the cloth of his breeches.</p><p>Grey could feel the men behind him, soldiers and prisoners both, all eyes fixed on the platform and its central figure. Even the coughing was silenced.</p><p>And over it all like a sticky coat of varnish sealing off Grey\u2019s feelings was a thin layer of self-disgust, as he realized that his eyes were fixed on the scene not out of duty, but from sheer inability to look away from the sheen of mingled rain and blood that gleamed on muscle, tightened in anguish to a curve of wrenching beauty.</p><p>The sergeant-farrier paused only briefly between blows. He was hurrying it slightly; everyone wanted to get it over and get out of the rain. Grissom counted each stroke in a loud voice, noting it on his sheet as he did so. The farrier checked the lash, running the strands with their hard-waxed knots between his fingers to free them of blood and bits of flesh, then raised the cat once more, swung it slowly twice round his head, and struck again. \u201cThirty!\u201d said the sergeant.</p><p>Major Grey pulled out the lowest drawer of his desk, and was neatly sick, all over a stack of requisitions.</p> <p>His fingers were dug hard into his palms, but the shaking wouldn\u2019t stop. It was deep in his bones, like the winter cold.</p><p>\u201cPut a blanket over him; I\u2019ll tend him in a moment.\u201d</p><p>The English surgeon\u2019s voice seemed to come from a long way off; he felt no connection between the voice and the hands that gripped him firmly by both arms. He cried out as they shifted him, the torsion splitting the barely clotted wounds on his back. The trickle of warm blood across his ribs made the shaking worse, despite the rough blanket they laid over his shoulders.</p><p>He gripped the edges of the bench on which he lay, cheek pressed against the wood, eyes closed, struggling against the shaking. There was a stir and a shuffle somewhere in the room, but he couldn\u2019t take notice, couldn\u2019t take his attention from the clenching of his teeth and the tightness of his joints.</p><p>The door closed, and the room grew quiet. Had they left him alone?</p><p>No, there were footsteps near his head, and the blanket over him lifted, folded back to his waist.</p> <p>\u201cMm. Made a mess of you, didn\u2019t he, boy?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer; no answer seemed expected, in any case. The surgeon turned away for a moment; then he felt a hand beneath his cheek, lifting his head. A towel slid beneath his face, cushioning it from the rough wood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to cleanse the wounds now,\u201d the voice said. It was impersonal, but not unfriendly.</p><p>He drew in his breath through his teeth as a hand touched his back. There was an odd whimpering noise. He realized he had made it, and was ashamed.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen.\u201d He barely got the word out, before biting down hard on a moan.</p><p>The doctor touched his back gently here and there, then stood up. He heard the sound of the bolt being shot to, then the doctor\u2019s steps returning.</p><p>\u201cNo one will come in now,\u201d the voice said kindly. \u201cGo ahead and cry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d the voice was saying. \u201cWake up, man!\u201d</p><p>He came slowly to consciousness; the roughness of wood beneath his cheek brought dream and waking together for a moment, and he couldn\u2019t remember where he was. A hand came out of the darkness, touching him tentatively on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cYe were greetin\u2019 in your sleep, man,\u201d the voice whispered. \u201cDoes it pain ye much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d He realized the other link between dreaming and waking as he tried to raise himself and the pain crackled over his back like sheet lightning. He let out his breath in an involuntary grunt and dropped back on the bench.</p><p>He had been lucky; he had drawn Dawes, a stout, middle-aged soldier who didn\u2019t really like flogging prisoners, and did it only because it was part of his job. Still, sixty lashes did damage, even if applied without enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cNah, then, that\u2019s too hot by half. Want to scald him, do ye?\u201d It was Morrison\u2019s voice, scolding. It would be Morrison, of course.</p><p>Odd, he thought dimly. How whenever you had a group of men, they seemed to find their proper jobs, no matter whether it was a thing they\u2019d done before. Morrison had been a cottar, like most of them. Likely a good hand with his beasts, but not thinking much about it. Now he was the natural healer for the men, the one they turned to with a griping belly or a broken thumb. Morrison knew little more than the rest, but the men turned to him when they were hurt, as they turned to Seumus Mac Dubh for reassurance and direction. And for justice.</p><p>The steaming cloth was laid across his back and he grunted with the sting of it, pressing his lips tight to keep from crying out. He could feel the shape of Morrison\u2019s small hand, lightly laid in the center of his back.</p><p>\u201cBide ye, man,\u2019til the heat passes.\u201d</p><p>As the nightmare faded, he blinked for a moment, adjusting himself to the nearby voices and the perception of company. He was in the large cell, in the shadowy nook by the chimney breast. Steam rose from the fire; there must be a cauldron boiling. He saw Walter MacLeod lower a fresh armful of rags into its depths, the fire touching MacLeod\u2019s dark beard and brows with red. Then, as the heated rags on his back cooled to a soothing warmth, he closed his eyes and sank back into a half-doze, lulled by the soft conversation of the men nearby.</p><p>It was familiar, this state of dreamy detachment. He had felt much the same ever since the moment when he had reached over young Angus\u2019s shoulder and closed his fist on the scrap of tartan cloth. As though with that choice, some curtain had come down between him and the men around him; as though he were alone, in some quiet place of infinite remoteness.</p><p>He had followed the guard who took him, stripped himself when told, but all without feeling as though he had truly waked. Taken his place on the platform and heard the words of crime and sentence pronounced, without really listening. Not even the rough bite of the rope on his wrists or the cold rain on his naked back had roused him. These seemed all things that had happened before; nothing he said or did could change a thing; it was all fated.</p><p>As for the flogging, he had borne it. There was no room then for thought or regret, or for anything beyond the stubborn, desperate struggle such bodily insult required.</p><p>\u201cStill, now, still.\u201d Morrison\u2019s hand rested on his neck, to prevent his moving as the sodden rags were taken off and a fresh, hot poultice applied, momentarily rousing all the dormant nerves to fresh startlement.</p><p>One consequence of his odd state of mind was that all sensations seemed of equal intensity. He could, if he tried, feel each separate stripe across his back, see each one in his mind\u2019s eye as a vivid streak of color across the dark of imagination. But the pain of the gash that ran from ribs to shoulder was of no more weight or consequence than the almost pleasant feeling of heaviness in his legs, the soreness in his arms, or the soft tickling brush of his hair across his cheek.</p><p>His pulse beat slow and regular in his ears; the sigh of his breath was a thing apart from the heave of his chest as he breathed. He existed only as a collection of fragments, each small piece with its own sensations, and none of them of any particular concern to the central intelligence.</p><p>\u201cHere, Mac Dubh,\u201d said Morrison\u2019s voice, next to his ear. \u201cLift your head, and drink this.\u201d</p><p>The sharp scent of whisky struck him, and he tried to turn his head away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat ye do,\u201d Morrison said, with that firm matter-of-factness that all healers seemed to have, as though they always knew better than you did what you felt like or what you required. Lacking strength or will to argue, he opened his mouth and sipped the whisky, feeling his neck muscles quiver under the strain of holding his head up.</p><p>The whisky added its own bit to the chorus of sensations that filled him. A burn in throat and belly, sharp tingle up the back of the nose, and a sort of whirling in his head that told him he had drunk too much, too fast.</p><p>\u201cA bit more, now, aye, that\u2019s it,\u201d Morrison said, coaxing. \u201cGood lad. Aye, that\u2019ll be better, won\u2019t it?\u201d Morrison\u2019s thick body moved, so his vision of the darkened room was obscured. A draft blew from the high window, but there seemed more stir about him than was accounted for by the wind.</p><p>\u201cNow, how\u2019s the back? Ye\u2019ll be stiff as a cornstook by the morrow, but I think it\u2019s maybe no so bad as it might be. Here, man, ye\u2019ll have a sup more.\u201d The rim of the horn cup pressed insistently against his mouth.</p><p>Morrison was still talking, rather loudly, of nothing in particular. There was something wrong about that. Morrison was not a talkative man. Something was happening, but he couldn\u2019t see. He lifted his head, searching for what was wrong, but Morrison pressed it down again.</p><p>\u201cDinna trouble yourself, Mac Dubh,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYe canna stop it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Surreptitious sounds were coming from the far corner of the cell, the sounds Morrison had tried to keep him from hearing. Scraping noises, brief mutters, a thud. Then the muffled sound of blows, slow and regular, and a heavy gasping of fright and pain, punctuated with a small whimpering sound of indrawn breath.</p><p>They were beating young Angus MacKenzie. He braced his hands beneath his chest, but the effort made his back blaze and his head swim. Morrison\u2019s hand was back, forcing him down.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Mac Dubh,\u201d he said. His tone was a mixture of authority and resignation.</p><p>A wave of dizziness washed through him, and his hands slipped off the bench. Morrison was right in any case, he realized. He couldn\u2019t stop them.</p><p>He lay still then under Morrison\u2019s hand, eyes closed, and waited for the sounds to stop. Despite himself, he wondered who it was, that administrator of blind justice in the dark. Sinclair. His mind supplied the answer without hesitation. And Hayes and Lindsay helping, no doubt.</p><p>They could no more help themselves than he could, or Morrison. Men did as they were born to. One man a healer, another a bully.</p><p>The sounds had stopped, except for a muffled, sobbing gasp. His shoulders relaxed, and he didn\u2019t move as Morrison took away the last wet poultice and gently blotted him dry, the draft from the window making him shiver in sudden chill. He pressed his lips tight, to make no noise. They had gagged him this afternoon, and he was glad of it; the first time he had been flogged, years ago, he had bitten his lower lip nearly in two. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cup of whisky pressed against his mouth, but he turned his head aside, and it disappeared without comment to some place where it would find a more cordial reception. Milligan, likely, the Irishman.</p><p>One man with the weakness for drink, another with a hatred of it. One man a lover of women, and another...</p><p>He sighed and shifted slightly on the hard plank bed. Morrison had covered him with a blanket and gone away. He felt drained and empty, still in fragments, but with his mind quite clear, perched at some far remove from the rest of him.</p><p>Morrison had taken away the candle as well; it burned at the far end of the cell, where the men sat hunched companionably together, the light making black shapes of them, one indistinguishable from another, rimmed in gold light like the pictures of faceless saints in old missals.</p> <p>He wondered where they came from, these gifts that shaped a man\u2019s nature. From God?</p><p>Was it like the descent of the Paraclete, and the tongues of fire that came to rest on the apostles? He remembered the picture in the Bible in his mother\u2019s parlor, the apostles all crowned with fire, and looking fair daft with the shock of it, standing about like a crowd of beeswax candles, lit for a party.</p><p>He smiled to himself at the memory, and closed his eyes. The candle shadows wavered red on his lids.</p><p>Claire, his own Claire\u2014who knew what had sent her to him, had thrust her into a life she had surely not been born to? And yet she had known what to do, what she was meant to be, despite that. Not everyone was so fortunate as to know their gift.</p><p>There was a cautious shuffling in the darkness beside him. He opened his eyes and saw no more than a shape, but knew nonetheless who it was.</p> <p>\u201cHow are ye, Angus?\u201d he said softly in Gaelic.</p><p>The youngster knelt awkwardly by him, and took his hand.</p><p>\u201cI am...all right. But you\u2014sir, I mean...I\u2014I\u2019m sorry...\u201d</p><p>Was it experience or instinct that made him tighten his own hand in reassurance?</p><p>\u201cI am all right, too,\u201d he said. \u201cLay ye down, wee Angus, and take your rest.\u201d</p><p>The shape bent its head in an oddly formal gesture, and pressed a kiss on the back of his hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014may I stay by ye, sir?\u201d</p><p>His hand weighed a ton, but he lifted it nonetheless and laid it on the young man\u2019s head. Then it slipped away, but he felt Angus\u2019s tension relax, as the comfort flowed from his touch.</p><p>He had been born a leader, then bent and shaped further to fit such a destiny. But what of a man who had not been born to the role he was required to fill? John Grey, for one. Charles Stuart for another.</p><p>For the first time in ten years, from this strange distance, he could find it in himself to forgive that feeble man who had once been his friend. Having so often paid the price exacted by his own gift, he could at last see the more terrible doom of having been born a king, without the gift of kingship.</p><p>Angus MacKenzie sat slumped against the wall next to him, head bowed upon his knees, his blanket over his shoulders. A small, gurgling snore came from the huddled form. He could feel sleep coming for him, fitting back the shattered, scattered parts of himself as it came, and knew he would wake whole\u2014if very sore\u2014in the morning.</p><p>He felt relieved at once of many things. Of the weight of immediate responsibility, of the necessity for decision. Temptation was gone, along with the possibility of it. More important, the burden of anger had lifted; perhaps it was gone for good.</p><p>So, he thought, through the gathering fog, John Grey had given him back his destiny.</p><p>Almost, he could be grateful.</p> <p>13</p><p>MIDGAME</p><p>Inverness</p><p>June 2, 1968</p><p>It was Roger who found her in the morning, curled up on the study sofa under the hearthrug, papers scattered carelessly over the floor where they had spilled from one of the folders.</p><p>The light from the floor-length windows streamed in, flooding the study, but the high back of the sofa had shaded Claire\u2019s face and prevented the dawn from waking her. The light was just now pouring over the curve of dusty velvet to flicker among the strands of her hair.</p><p>A glass face in more ways than one, Roger thought, looking at her. Her skin was so fair that the blue veins showed through at temple and throat, and the sharp, clear bones were so close beneath that she might have been carved of ivory.</p><p>The rug had slipped half off, exposing her shoulders. One arm lay relaxed across her chest, trapping a single, crumpled sheet of paper against her body. Roger lifted her arm carefully, to pull the paper loose without waking her. She was limp with sleep, her flesh surprisingly warm and smooth in his grasp.</p><p>His eyes found the name at once; he had known she must have found it.</p><p>\u201cJames MacKenzie Fraser,\u201d he murmured. He looked up from the paper to the sleeping woman on the sofa. The light had just touched the curve of her ear; she stirred briefly and turned her head, then her face lapsed back into somnolence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you were, mate,\u201d he whispered to the unseen Scot, \u201cbut you must have been something, to deserve her.\u201d</p><p>Very gently, he replaced the rug over Claire\u2019s shoulders, and lowered the blind of the window behind her. Then he squatted and gathered up the scattered papers from the Ardsmuir folder. Ardsmuir. That was all he needed for now; even if Jamie Fraser\u2019s eventual fate was not recorded in the pages in his hands, it would be somewhere in the history of Ardsmuir prison. It might take another foray into the Highland archives, or even a trip to London, but the next step in the link had been forged; the path was clear.</p><p>Brianna was coming down the stairs as he pulled the door of the study closed, moving with exaggerated caution. She arched a brow in question and he lifted the folder, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGot him,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but an answering smile spread across her face, bright as the rising sun outside.</p><p>PART FOUR</p><p>The Lake District</p><p>14</p><p>GENEVA</p><p>Helwater</p><p>September 1756</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Grey said carefully, \u201cthat you might consider changing your name.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect an answer; in four days of travel, Fraser had not spoken a single word to him, managing even the awkward business of sharing an inn room without direct communication. Grey had shrugged and taken the bed, while Fraser, without gesture or glance, had wrapped himself in his threadbare cloak and lain down before the hearth. Scratching an assortment of bites from fleas and bedbugs, Grey thought that Fraser might well have had the better end of the sleeping arrangements.</p><p>\u201cYour new host is not well disposed toward Charles Stuart and his adherents, having lost his only son at Prestonpans,\u201d he went on, addressing the iron-set profile visible next to him. Gordon Dunsany had been only a few years older than himself, a young captain in Bolton\u2019s regiment. They might easily have died together on that field\u2014if not for that meeting in the wood near Carryarrick.</p><p>\u201cYou can scarcely hope to conceal the fact that you are a Scot, and a Highlander at that. If you will condescend to consider a piece of well-meant advice, it might be judicious not to use a name which would be as easily recognized as your own.\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s stony expression didn\u2019t alter in the slightest particular. He nudged his horse with a heel and guided it ahead of Grey\u2019s bay, seeking the remains of the track, washed out by a recent flood.</p><p>It was late afternoon when they crossed the arch of Ashness Bridge and started down the slope toward Watendlath Tarn. The Lake District of England was nothing like Scotland, Grey reflected, but at least there were mountains here. Round-flanked, fat and dreamy mountains, not sternly forbidding like the Highland crags, but mountains nonetheless.</p><p>Watendlath Tarn was dark and ruffled in the early autumn wind, its edges thick with sedge and marsh grass. The summer rains had been more generous even than usual in this damp place, and the tips of drowned shrubs poked limp and tattered above water that had run over its banks.</p><p>At the crest of the next hill, the track split, going off in two directions. Fraser, some distance ahead, pulled his horse to a stop and waited for direction, the wind ruffling his hair. He had not plaited it that morning, and it blew free, the flaming strands lifting wild about his head.</p><p>Squelching his way up the slope, John William Grey looked up at the man above him, still as a bronze statue on his mount, save for that rippling mane. The breath dried in his throat, and he licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cO Lucifer, thou son of the morning,\u201d he murmured to himself, but forbore to add the rest of the quotation.</p><p>For Jamie, the four-day ride to Helwater had been torture. The sudden illusion of freedom, combined with the certainty of its immediate loss, gave him a dreadful anticipation of his unknown destination.</p><p>This, with the anger and sorrow of his parting from his men fresh in memory\u2014the wrenching loss of leaving the Highlands, with the knowledge that the parting might well be permanent\u2014and his waking moments suffused with the physical pain of long-unused saddle muscles, were together enough to have kept him in torment for the whole of the journey. Only the fact that he had given his parole kept him from pulling Major John William Grey off his horse and throttling him in some peaceful lane.</p><p>Grey\u2019s words echoed in his ears, half-obliterated by the thrumming beat of his angry blood.</p><p>\u201cAs the renovation of the fortress has largely been completed\u2014with the able assistance of yourself and your men\u201d\u2014Grey had allowed a tinge of irony to show in his voice\u2014\u201cthe prisoners are to be removed to other accommodation, and the fortress of Ardsmuir garrisoned by troops of His Majesty\u2019s Twelfth Dragoons.</p><p>\u201cThe Scottish prisoners of war are to be transported to the American Colonies,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey will be sold under bond of indenture, for a term of seven years.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had kept himself carefully expressionless, but at that news, had felt his face and hands go numb with shock.</p><p>\u201cIndenture? That is no better than slavery,\u201d he said, but did not pay much attention to his own words. America! A land of wilderness and savages\u2014and one to be reached across three thousand miles of empty, roiling sea! Indenture in America was a sentence tantamount to permanent exile from Scotland.</p><p>\u201cA term of indenture is not slavery,\u201d Grey had assured him, but the Major knew as well as he that the difference was merely a legality, and true only insofar as indentured servants would\u2014if they survived\u2014regain their freedom upon some predetermined date. An indentured servant was to most other intents and purposes the slave of his or her master\u2014to be misused, whipped or branded at will, forbidden by law to leave the master\u2019s premises without permission.</p><p>As James Fraser was now to be forbidden.</p><p>\u201cYou are not to be sent with the others.\u201d Grey had not looked at him while speaking. \u201cYou are not merely a prisoner of war, you are a convicted traitor. As such, you are imprisoned at the pleasure of His Majesty; your sentence cannot be commuted to transportation without royal approval. And His Majesty has not seen fit to give that approval.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was conscious of a remarkable array of emotions; beneath his immediate rage was fear and sorrow for the fate of his men, mingled with a small flicker of ignominious relief that, whatever his own fate was to be, it would not involve entrusting himself to the sea. Shamed by the realization, he turned a cold eye on Grey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe gold,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThat\u2019s it, aye?\u201d So long as there remained the slightest chance of his revealing what he knew about that half-mythical hoard, the English Crown would take no chance of having him lost to the sea demons or the savages of the Colonies.</p><p>The Major still would not look at him, but gave a small shrug, as good as assent.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I to go, then?\u201d His own voice had sounded rusty to his ears, slightly hoarse as he began to recover from the shock of the news.</p><p>Grey had busied himself putting away his records. It was early September, and a warm breeze blew through the half-open window, fluttering the papers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called Helwater. In the Lake District of England. You will be quartered with Lord Dunsany, to serve in whatever menial capacity he may require.\u201d Grey did look up then, the expression in his light blue eyes unreadable. \u201cI shall visit you there once each quarter\u2014to ensure your welfare.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the Major\u2019s red-coated back now, as they rode single-file through the narrow lanes, seeking refuge from his miseries in a satisfying vision of those wide blue eyes, bloodshot and popping in amazement as Jamie\u2019s hands tightened on that slender throat, thumbs digging into the sun-reddened flesh until the Major\u2019s small, muscular body should go limp as a killed rabbit in his grasp.</p><p>His Majesty\u2019s pleasure, was it? He was not deceived. This had been Grey\u2019s doing; the gold only an excuse. He was to be sold as a servant, and kept in a place where Grey could see it, and gloat. This was the Major\u2019s revenge.</p><p>He had lain before the inn hearth each night, aching in every limb, acutely aware of every twitch and rustle and breath of the man in the bed behind him, and deeply resentful of that awareness. By the pale gray of dawn, he was keyed to fury once more, longing for the man to rise from his bed and make some disgraceful gesture toward him, so that he might release his fury in the passion of murder. But Grey had only snored.</p><p>Over Helvellyn Bridge and past another of the strange grassy tarns, the red and yellow leaves of maple and larch whirling down in showers past the lightly sweated quarters of his horse, striking his face and sliding past him with a papery, whispering caress.</p> <p>Grey had stopped just ahead, and turned in the saddle, waiting. They had arrived, then. The land sloped steeply down into a valley, where the manor house lay half-concealed in a welter of autumn-bright trees.</p><p>Helwater lay before him, and with it, the prospect of a life of shameful servitude. He stiffened his back and kicked his horse, harder than he intended.</p><p>Grey was received in the main drawing room, Lord Dunsany being cordially dismissive of his disheveled clothes and filthy boots, and Lady Dunsany, a small round woman with faded fair hair, fulsomely hospitable.</p><p>\u201cA drink, Johnny, you must have a drink! And Louisa, my dear, perhaps you should fetch the girls down to greet our guest.\u201d</p><p>As Lady Dunsany turned to give orders to a footman, his Lordship leaned close over the glass to murmur to him. \u201cThe Scottish prisoner\u2014you\u2019ve brought him with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Grey said. Lady Dunsany, now in animated conversation with the butler about the altered dispositions for dinner, was unlikely to overhear, but he thought it best to keep his own voice low. \u201cI left him in the front hall\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure quite what you meant to do with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said the fellow\u2019s good with horses, eh? Best make him a groom then, as you suggested.\u201d Lord Dunsany glanced at his wife, and carefully turned so that his lean back was to her, further guarding their conversation. \u201cI haven\u2019t told Louisa who he is,\u201d the baronet muttered. \u201cAll that scare about the Highlanders during the Rising\u2014country was quite paralyzed with fear, you know? And she\u2019s never got over Gordon\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quite see.\u201d Grey patted the old man\u2019s arm reassuringly. He didn\u2019t think Dunsany himself had got over the death of his son, though he had rallied himself gamely for the sake of his wife and daughters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just tell her the man\u2019s a servant you\u2019ve recommended to me. Er...he\u2019s safe, of course? I mean...well, the girls...\u201d Lord Dunsany cast an uneasy eye toward his wife.</p><p>\u201cQuite safe,\u201d Grey assured his host. \u201cHe\u2019s an honorable man, and he\u2019s given his parole. He\u2019ll neither enter the house, nor leave the boundaries of your property, save with your express permission.\u201d Helwater covered more than six hundred acres, he knew. It was a long way from freedom, and from Scotland as well, but perhaps something better either than the narrow stones of Ardsmuir or the distant hardships of the Colonies.</p><p>A sound from the doorway swung Dunsany around, restored to beaming joviality by the appearance of his two daughters.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll remember Geneva, Johnny?\u201d he asked, urging his guest forward. \u201cIsobel was still in the nursery last time you came\u2014how time does fly, does it not?\u201d And he shook his head in mild dismay.</p><p>Isobel was fourteen, small and round and bubbly and blond, like her mother. Grey didn\u2019t, in fact, remember Geneva\u2014or rather he did, but the scrawny schoolgirl of years past bore little resemblance to the graceful seventeen-year-old who now offered him her hand. If Isobel resembled their mother, Geneva rather took after her father, at least in the matter of height and leanness. Lord Dunsany\u2019s grizzled hair might once have been that shining chestnut, and the girl had Dunsany\u2019s clear gray eyes.</p><p>The girls greeted the visitor with politeness, but were clearly more interested in something else.</p> <p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d said Isobel, tugging on her father\u2019s sleeve. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge man in the hall! He watched us all the time we were coming down the stairs! He\u2019s scary-looking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he, Daddy?\u201d Geneva asked. She was more reserved than her sister, but clearly also interested.</p><p>\u201cEr...why, that must be the new groom John\u2019s brought us,\u201d Lord Dunsany said, obviously flustered. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of the footmen take him\u2014\u201d The baronet was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a footman in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d he said, looking shocked at the news he bore, \u201cthere is a Scotchman in the hall!\u201d Lest this outrageous statement not be believed, he turned and gestured widely at the tall, silent figure standing cloaked behind him.</p><p>At this cue, the stranger took a step forward, and spotting Lord Dunsany, politely inclined his head.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Alex MacKenzie,\u201d he said, in a soft Highland accent. He bowed toward Lord Dunsany, with no hint of mockery in his manner. \u201cYour servant, my lord.\u201d</p><p>For one accustomed to the strenuous life of a Highland farm or a labor prison, the work of a groom on a Lake District stud farm was no great strain. For a man who had been mewed up in a cell for two months\u2014since the others had left for the Colonies\u2014it was the hell of a sweat. For the first week, while his muscles reaccustomed themselves to the sudden demands of constant movement, Jamie Fraser fell into his hayloft pallet each evening too tired even to dream.</p><p>He had arrived at Helwater in such a state of exhaustion and mental turmoil that he had at first seen it only as another prison\u2014and one among strangers, far away from the Highlands. Now that he was ensconced here, imprisoned as securely by his word as by bars, he found both body and mind growing easier, as the days passed by. His body toughened, his feelings calmed in the quiet company of horses, and gradually he found it possible to think rationally again.</p><p>If he had no true freedom, he did at least have air, and light, space to stretch his limbs, and the sight of mountains and the lovely horses that Dunsany bred. The other grooms and servants were understandably suspicious of him, but inclined to leave him alone, out of respect for his size and forbidding countenance. It was a lonely life\u2014but he had long since accepted the fact that for him, life was unlikely ever to be otherwise.</p><p>The soft snows came down upon Helwater, and even Major Grey\u2019s official visit at Christmas\u2014a tense, awkward occasion\u2014passed without disturbing his growing feelings of content.</p><p>Very quietly, he made such arrangements as could be managed, to communicate with Jenny and Ian in the Highlands. Aside from the infrequent letters that reached him by indirect means, which he read and then destroyed for safety\u2019s sake, his only reminder of home was the beechwood rosary he wore about his neck, concealed beneath his shirt.</p><p>A dozen times a day he touched the small cross that lay over his heart, conjuring each time the face of a loved one, with a brief word of prayer\u2014for his sister, Jenny; for Ian and the children\u2014his namesake, Young Jamie, Maggie, and Katherine Mary, for the twins Michael and Janet, and for Baby Ian. For the tenants of Lallybroch, the men of Ardsmuir. And always, the first prayer at morning, the last at night\u2014and many between\u2014for Claire. Lord, that she may be safe. She and the child.</p><p>As the snow passed and the year brightened into spring, Jamie Fraser was aware of only one fly in the ointment of his daily existence\u2014the presence of the Lady Geneva Dunsany.</p><p>Pretty, spoilt, and autocratic, the Lady Geneva was accustomed to get what she wanted when she wanted it, and damn the convenience of anyone standing in her way. She was a good horsewoman\u2014Jamie would give her that\u2014but so sharp-tongued and whim-ridden that the grooms were given to drawing straws to determine who would have the misfortune of accompanying her on her daily ride.</p><p>Of late, though, the Lady Geneva had been making her own choice of companion\u2014Alex MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she said, when he pleaded first discretion, and then temporary indisposition, to avoid accompanying her into the secluded mist of the foothills above Helwater; a place she was forbidden to ride, because of the treacherous footing and dangerous fogs. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Nobody\u2019s going to see us. Come on!\u201d And kicking her mare brutally in the ribs, was off before he could stop her, laughing back over her shoulder at him.</p><p>Her infatuation with him was sufficiently obvious as to make the other grooms grin sidelong and make low-voiced remarks to each other when she entered the stable. He had a strong urge, when in her company, to boot her swiftly where it would do most good, but so far had settled for maintaining a strict silence when in her company, replying to all overtures with a mumpish grunt.</p><p>He trusted that she would get tired of this taciturn treatment sooner or later, and transfer her annoying attentions to another of the grooms. Or\u2014pray God\u2014she would soon be married, and well away from both Helwater and him.</p><p>It was a rare sunny day for the Lake Country, where the difference between the clouds and the ground is often imperceptible, in terms of damp. Still, on this May afternoon it was warm, warm enough for Jamie to have found it comfortable to remove his shirt. It was safe enough up here in the high field, with no likelihood of company beyond Bess and Blossom, the two stolid drayhorses pulling the roller.</p><p>It was a big field, and the horses old and well-trained to the task, which they liked; all he need do was twitch the reins occasionally, to keep their noses heading straight. The roller was made of wood, rather than the older kind of stone or metal, and constructed with a narrow slit between each board, so that the interior could be filled with well-rotted manure, which dribbled out in a steady stream as the roller turned, lightening the heavy contrivance as it drained. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie thoroughly approved this innovation. He must tell Ian about it; draw a diagram. The gypsies would be coming soon; the kitchenmaids and grooms were all talking of it. He would maybe have time to add another installment to the ongoing letter he kept, sending the current crop of pages whenever a band of roving tinkers or gypsies came onto the farm. Delivery might be delayed for a month, or three, or six, but eventually the packet would make its way into the Highlands, passed from hand to hand, and on to his sister at Lallybroch, who would pay a generous fee for its reception.</p><p>Replies from Lallybroch came by the same anonymous route\u2014for as a prisoner of the Crown, anything he sent or received by the mails must be inspected by Lord Dunsany. He felt a moment\u2019s excitement at the thought of a letter, but tried to damp it down; there might be nothing.</p><p>\u201cGee!\u201d he shouted, more as a matter of form than anything. Bess and Blossom could see the approaching stone fence as well as he could, and were perfectly well aware that this was the spot to begin the ponderous turnabout. Bess waggled one ear and snorted, and he grinned.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d he said to her, with a light twitch of the rein. \u201cBut they pay me to say it.\u201d</p> <p>Then they were settled in the new track, and there was nothing more to do until they reached the wagon standing at the foot of the field, piled high with manure for refilling the roller. The sun was on his face now, and he closed his eyes, reveling in the feel of warmth on his bare chest and shoulders.</p><p>The sound of a horse\u2019s high whinny stirred him from somnolence a quarter-hour later. Opening his eyes, he could see the rider coming up the lane from the lower paddock, neatly framed between Blossom\u2019s ears. Hastily, he sat up and pulled the shirt back over his head.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t be modest on my account, MacKenzie.\u201d Geneva Dunsany\u2019s voice was high and slightly breathless as she pulled her mare to a walk beside the moving roller.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d She was dressed in her best habit, he saw, with a cairngorm brooch at her throat, and her color was higher than the temperature of the day warranted.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, after they had rolled and paced in silence for some moments.</p> <p>\u201cI am spreading shit, my lady,\u201d he answered precisely, not looking at her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She rode on for the space of half a track, before venturing further into conversation.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I am to be married?\u201d</p><p>He did; all the servants had known it for a month, Richards the butler having been in the library, serving, when the solicitor came from Derwentwater to draw up the wedding contract. The Lady Geneva had been informed two days ago. According to her maid, Betty, the news had not been well received.</p><p>He contented himself with a noncommittal grunt.</p><p>\u201cTo Ellesmere,\u201d she said. The color rose higher in her cheeks, and her lips pressed together.</p> <p>\u201cI wish ye every happiness, my lady.\u201d Jamie pulled briefly on the reins as they came to the end of the field. He was out of the seat before Bess had set her hooves; he had no wish at all to linger in conversation with the Lady Geneva, whose mood seemed thoroughly dangerous.</p><p>\u201cHappiness!\u201d she cried. Her big gray eyes flashed and she slapped the thigh of her habit. \u201cHappiness! Married to a man old enough to be my own grandsire?\u201d</p><p>Jamie refrained from saying that he suspected the Earl of Ellesmere\u2019s prospects for happiness were somewhat more limited than her own. Instead, he murmured, \u201cYour pardon, my lady,\u201d and went behind to unfasten the roller.</p><p>She dismounted and followed him. \u201cIt\u2019s a filthy bargain between my father and Ellesmere! He\u2019s selling me, that\u2019s what it is. My father cares not the slightest trifle for me, or he\u2019d never have made such a match! Do you not think I am badly used?\u201d</p><p>On the contrary, Jamie thought that Lord Dunsany, a most devoted father, had probably made the best match possible for his spoilt elder daughter. The Earl of Ellesmere was an old man. There was every prospect that within a few years, Geneva would be left as an extremely wealthy young widow, and a countess, to boot. On the other hand, such considerations might well not weigh heavily with a headstrong miss\u2014a stubborn, spoilt bitch, he corrected, seeing the petulant set of her mouth and eyes\u2014of seventeen.</p><p>\u201cI am sure your father acts always in your best interests, my lady,\u201d he answered woodenly. Would the little fiend not go away?</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t. Assuming a more winsome expression, she came and stood close to his side, interfering with his opening the loading hatch of the roller.</p><p>\u201cBut a match with such a dried-up old man?\u201d she said. \u201cSurely it is heartless of Father to give me to such a creature.\u201d She stood on tiptoe, peering at Jamie. \u201cHow old are you, MacKenzie?\u201d</p> <p>His heart stopped beating for an instant.</p><p>\u201cA verra great deal older than you, my lady,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cYour pardon, my lady.\u201d He slid past her as well as he might without touching her, and leaped up onto the manure wagon, whence he was reasonably sure she wouldn\u2019t follow him.</p><p>\u201cBut not ready for the boneyard yet, are you, MacKenzie?\u201d Now she was in front of him, shading her eyes with her hand as she peered upward. A breeze had come up, and wisps of her chestnut hair floated about her face. \u201cHave you ever been married, MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth, overcome with the urge to drop a shovelful of manure over her chestnut head, but mastered it and dug the shovel into the pile, merely saying \u201cI have,\u201d in a tone that brooked no further inquiries.</p><p>The Lady Geneva was not interested in other people\u2019s sensitivities. \u201cGood,\u201d she said, satisfied. \u201cYou\u2019ll know what to do, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do?\u201d He stopped short in the act of digging, one foot braced on the shovel.</p><p>\u201cIn bed,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI want you to come to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>In the shock of the moment, all he could think of was the ludicrous vision of the elegant Lady Geneva, skirts thrown up over her face, asprawl in the rich crumble of the manure wagon.</p><p>He dropped the shovel. \u201cHere?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, silly,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cIn bed, in a proper bed. In my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have lost your mind,\u201d Jamie said coldly, the shock receding slightly. \u201cOr I should think you had, if ye had one to lose.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed and her eyes narrowed. \u201cHow dare you speak that way to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare ye speak so to me?\u201d Jamie replied hotly. \u201cA wee lassie of breeding to be makin\u2019 indecent proposals to a man twice her age? And a groom in her father\u2019s house?\u201d he added, recollecting who he was. He choked back further remarks, recollecting also that this dreadful girl was the Lady Geneva, and he was her father\u2019s groom.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, my lady,\u201d he said, mastering his choler with some effort. \u201cThe sun is verra hot today, and no doubt it has addled your wits a bit. I expect ye should go back to the house at once and ask your maid to put cold cloths on your head.\u201d</p><p>The Lady Geneva stamped her morocco-booted foot. \u201cMy wits are not addled in the slightest!\u201d</p><p>She glared up at him, chin set. Her chin was little and pointed, so were her teeth, and with that particular expression of determination on her face, he thought she looked a great deal like the bloody-minded vixen she was.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot prevent this abominable marriage. But I am\u201d\u2014she hesitated, then continued firmly\u2014\u201cI am damned if I will suffer my maidenhood to be given to a disgusting, depraved old monster like Ellesmere!\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand across his mouth. Despite himself, he felt some sympathy for her. But he would be damned if he allowed this skirted maniac to involve him in her troubles.</p><p>\u201cI am fully sensible of the honor, my lady,\u201d he said at last, with a heavy irony, \u201cbut I really cannot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d Her eyes rested frankly on the front of his filthy breeches. \u201cBetty says so.\u201d</p><p>He struggled for speech, emerging at first with little more than incoherent sputterings. Finally he drew a deep breath and said, with all the firmness he could muster, \u201cBetty has not the slightest basis for drawing conclusions as to my capacity. I havena laid a hand on the lass!\u201d</p><p>Geneva laughed delightedly. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t take her to bed? She said you wouldn\u2019t, but I thought perhaps she was only trying to avoid a beating. That\u2019s good; I couldn\u2019t possibly share a man with my maid.\u201d</p><p>He breathed heavily. Smashing her on the head with the shovel or throttling her were unfortunately out of the question. His inflamed temper slowly calmed. Outrageous she might be, but essentially powerless. She could scarcely force him to go to her bed.</p><p>\u201cGood day to ye, my lady,\u201d he said, as politely as possible. He turned his back on her and began to shovel manure into the hollow roller.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t,\u201d she said sweetly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell my father you made improper advances to me. He\u2019ll have the skin flayed off your back.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders hunched involuntarily. She couldn\u2019t possibly know. He had been careful never to take his shirt off in front of anyone since he came here.</p><p>He turned carefully and stared down at her. The light of triumph was in her eye.</p><p>\u201cYour father may not be so well acquent\u2019 with me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s kent you since ye were born. Tell him, and be damned to ye!\u201d</p><p>She puffed up like a game cock, her face growing bright red with temper. \u201cIs that so?\u201d she cried. \u201cWell, look at this, then, and be damned to you!\u201d She reached into the bosom of her habit and pulled out a thick letter, which she waved under his nose. His sister\u2019s firm black hand was so familiar that a glimpse was enough.</p><p>\u201cGive me that!\u201d He was down off the wagon and after her in a flash, but she was too fast. She was up in the saddle before he could grab her, backing with the reins in one hand, waving the letter mockingly in the other.</p><p>\u201cWant it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want it! Give it to me!\u201d He was so furious, he could easily have done her violence, could he get his hands on her. Unfortunately, her bay mare sensed his mood, and backed away, snorting and pawing uneasily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She eyed him coquettishly, the red of ill temper fading from her face. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s really my duty to give this to my father, isn\u2019t it? He ought really to know that his servants are carrying on clandestine correspondences, shouldn\u2019t he? Is Jenny your sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve read my letter? Ye filthy wee bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch language,\u201d she said, wagging the letter reprovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty to help my parents, by letting them know what sorts of dreadful things the servants are up to, isn\u2019t it? And I am a dutiful daughter, am I not, submitting to this marriage without a squeak?\u201d She leaned forward on her pommel, smiling mockingly, and with a fresh spurt of rage, he realized that she was enjoying this very much indeed.</p><p>\u201cI expect Papa will find it very interesting reading,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially the bit about the gold to be sent to Lochiel in France. Isn\u2019t it still considered treason to be giving comfort to the King\u2019s enemies? Tsk,\u201d she said, clicking her tongue roguishly. \u201cHow wicked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thought he might be sick on the spot, from sheer terror. Did she have the faintest idea how many lives lay in that manicured white hand? His sister, Ian, their six children, all the tenants and families of Lallybroch\u2014perhaps even the lives of the agents who carried messages and money between Scotland and France, maintaining the precarious existence of the Jacobite exiles there.</p><p>He swallowed, once, and then again, before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. A more natural smile broke out on her face, and he realized how very young she was. Aye, well, and a wee adder\u2019s bite was as venomous as an auld one\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d she assured him, looking earnest. \u201cI\u2019ll give you your letter back afterward, and I won\u2019t ever say what was in it. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He tried to gather his wits enough to make a sensible plan. Sensible? Going into his master\u2019s house to ravish his daughter\u2019s maidenhood\u2014at her request? He had never heard of a less sensible prospect.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said again. \u201cWe must be careful.\u201d With a feeling of dull horror, he felt himself being drawn into the role of conspirator with her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry, I can arrange for my maid to be sent away, and the footman drinks; he\u2019s always asleep before ten o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrange it, then,\u201d he said, his stomach curdling. \u201cMind ye choose a safe day, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA safe day?\u201d She looked blank.</p> <p>\u201cSometime in the week after ye\u2019ve finished your courses,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to get wi\u2019 child then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blushed rosily at that, but looked at him with a new interest.</p><p>They looked at each other in silence for a long moment, suddenly linked by the prospect of the future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you word,\u201d she said at last, and wheeling her horse about, galloped away across the field, the mare\u2019s hooves kicking up spurts of the freshly spread manure.</p><p>Cursing fluently and silently, he crept beneath the row of larches. There wasn\u2019t much moon, which was a blessing. Six yards of open lawn to cross in a dash, and he was knee-deep in the columbine and germander of the flowerbed.</p><p>He looked up the side of the house, its bulk looming dark and forbidding above him. Yes, there was the candle in the window, as she\u2019d said. Still, he counted the windows carefully, to verify it. Heaven help him if he chose the wrong room. Heaven help him if it was the right one, too, he thought grimly, and took a firm hold on the trunk of the huge gray creeper that covered this side of the house.</p> <p>The leaves rustled like a hurricane and the stems, stout as they were, creaked and bent alarmingly under his weight. There was nothing for it but to climb as swiftly as possible, and be ready to hurl himself off into the night if any of the windows should suddenly be raised.</p><p>He arrived at the small balcony panting, heart racing, and drenched in sweat, despite the chilliness of the night. He paused a moment, alone beneath the faint spring stars, to draw breath. He used it to damn Geneva Dunsany once more, and then pushed open her door.</p><p>She had been waiting, and had plainly heard his approach up the ivy. She rose from the chaise where she had been sitting and came toward him, chin up, chestnut hair loose over her shoulders.</p><p>She was wearing a white nightgown of some sheer material, tied at the throat with a silk bow. The garment didn\u2019t look like the nightwear of a modest young lady, and he realized with a shock that she was wearing her bridal-night apparel.</p><p>\u201cSo you came.\u201d He heard the note of triumph in her voice, but also the faint quaver. So she hadn\u2019t been sure of him?</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t much choice,\u201d he said shortly, and turned to close the French doors behind him.</p><p>\u201cWill you have some wine?\u201d Striving for graciousness, she moved to the table, where a decanter stood with two glasses. How had she managed that? he wondered. Still, a glass of something wouldn\u2019t come amiss in the present circumstances. He nodded, and took the full glass from her hand.</p><p>He looked at her covertly as he sipped it. The nightdress did little to conceal her body, and as his heart gradually slowed from the panic of his ascent, he found his first fear\u2014that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his half of the bargain\u2014allayed without conscious effort. She was built narrowly, slim-hipped and small-breasted, but most definitely a woman.</p> <p>Finished, he set down the glass. No point in delay, he thought.</p><p>\u201cThe letter?\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cAfterward,\u201d she said, tightening her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow, or I leave.\u201d And he turned toward the window, as though about to execute the threat.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d He turned back, but eyed her with ill-disguised impatience.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d she said, trying to sound winsome and charming.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>She looked angry at that, and thrust out a petulant lower lip, but he merely looked stonily over his shoulder at her, still facing the window.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right then,\u201d she said at last, with a shrug. Digging under the layers of embroidery in a sewing box, she unearthed the letter and tossed it onto the washing stand beside him.</p><p>He snatched it up and unfolded the sheets, to be sure of it. He felt a surge of mingled fury and relief at the sight of the violated seal, and Jenny\u2019s familiar hand within, neat and strong.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Geneva\u2019s voice broke in upon his reading, impatient. \u201cPut that down and come here, Jamie. I\u2019m ready.\u201d She sat on the bed, arms curled around her knees.</p><p>He stiffened, and turned a very cold blue look on her, over the pages in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not use that name to me,\u201d he said. She lifted the pointed chin a trifle more and raised her plucked brows.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s yours. Your sister calls you so.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, then deliberately laid the letter aside, and bent his head to the laces of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll serve ye properly,\u201d he said, looking down at his working fingers, \u201cfor the sake of my own honor as a man, and yours as a woman. But\u201d\u2014he raised his head and the narrowed blue eyes bored into hers\u2014\u201chaving brought me to your bed by means of threats against my family, I\u2019ll not have ye call me by the name they give me.\u201d He stood motionless, eyes fixed on hers. At last she gave a very small nod, and her eyes dropped to the quilt.</p><p>She traced the pattern with a finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat must I call you, then?\u201d she asked at last, in a small voice. \u201cI can\u2019t call you MacKenzie!\u201d</p><p>The corners of his mouth lifted slightly as he looked at her. She looked quite small, huddled into herself with her arms locked around her knees and her head bowed. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cCall me Alex, then. It\u2019s my own name, as well.\u201d</p><p>She nodded without speaking. Her hair fell forward in wings about her face, but he could see the brief shine of her eyes as she peeped out from behind its cover.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou can watch me.\u201d He pushed the loose breeches down, rolling the stockings off with them. He shook them out and folded them neatly over a chair before beginning to unfasten his shirt, conscious of her gaze, still shy, but now direct. Out of some idea of thoughtfulness, he turned to face her before removing the shirt, to spare her for a moment the sight of his back.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The exclamation was soft, but enough to stop him.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no...I mean, it\u2019s only that I didn\u2019t expect...\u201d The hair swung forward again, but not before he had seen the telltale reddening of her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not seen a man naked before?\u201d he guessed. The shiny brown head swayed back and forth.</p><p>\u201cNoo,\u201d she said doubtfully, \u201cI have, only...it wasn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it usually isn\u2019t,\u201d he said matter-of-factly, sitting down on the bed beside her. \u201cBut if one is going to make love, it has to be, ye see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said, but still sounded doubtful. He tried to smile, to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It doesna get any bigger. And it wilna do anything strange, if ye want to touch it.\u201d At least he hoped it wouldn\u2019t. Being naked, in such close proximity to a half-clad girl, was doing terrible things to his powers of self-control. His traitorous, deprived anatomy didn\u2019t care a whit that she was a selfish, blackmailing little bitch. Perhaps fortunately, she declined his offer, shrinking back a little toward the wall, though her eyes stayed on him. He rubbed his chin dubiously.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you...I mean, have ye any idea how it\u2019s done?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze was clear and guileless, though her cheeks flamed.</p><p>\u201cWell, like the horses, I suppose?\u201d He nodded, but felt a pang, recalling his wedding night, when he too had expected it to be like horses.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cSlower, though. More gentle,\u201d he added, seeing her apprehensive look.</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s good. Nurse and the maids used to tell stories, about...men, and, er, getting married, and all...it sounded rather frightening.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cW-will it hurt much?\u201d She raised her head suddenly and looked him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if it does,\u201d she said bravely, \u201cit\u2019s only that I\u2019d like to know what to expect.\u201d He felt an unexpected small liking for her. She might be spoiled, selfish, and reckless, but there was some character to her, at least. Courage, to him, was no small virtue.</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I take my time to ready you\u201d (if he could take his time, amended his brain), \u201cI think it will be not much worse than a pinch.\u201d He reached out and nipped a fold of skin on her upper arm. She jumped and rubbed the spot, but smiled.</p><p>\u201cI can stand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the first time it\u2019s like that,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThe next time it will be better.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then after a moment\u2019s hesitation, edged toward him, reaching out a tentative finger.</p><p>\u201cMay I touch you?\u201d This time he really did laugh, though he choked the sound off quickly.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll have to, my lady, if I\u2019m to do what you asked of me.\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand slowly down his arm, so softly that the touch tickled, and his skin shivered in response. Gaining confidence, she let her hand circle his forearm, feeling the girth of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite...big.\u201d He smiled, but stayed motionless, letting her explore his body, at as much length as she might wish. He felt the muscles of his belly tighten as she stroked the length of one thigh, and ventured tentatively around the curve of one buttock. Her fingers approached the twisting, knotted line of the scar that ran the length of his left thigh, but stopped short.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIt doesna hurt me anymore.\u201d She didn\u2019t reply, but drew two fingers slowly along the length of the scar, exerting no pressure.</p><p>The questing hands, growing bolder, slid up over the rounded curves of his broad shoulders, slid down his back\u2014and stopped dead. He closed his eyes and waited, following her movements by the shifting of weight on the mattress. She moved behind him, and was silent. Then there was a quivering sigh, and the hands touched him again, soft on his ruined back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t afraid, when I said I\u2019d have you flogged?\u201d Her voice was queerly hoarse, but he kept still, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not much afraid of things, anymore.\u201d In fact, he was beginning to be afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his hands off her, or to handle her with the necessary gentleness, when the time came. His balls ached with need, and he could feel his heartbeat, pounding in his temples.</p><p>She got off the bed, and stood in front of him. He rose suddenly, startling her so that she stepped back a pace, but he reached out and rested his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMay I touch you, my lady?\u201d The words were teasing, but the touch was not. She nodded, too breathless to speak, and his arms came around her.</p> <p>He held her against his chest, not moving until her breathing slowed. He was conscious of an extraordinary mixture of feelings. He had never in his life taken a woman in his arms without some feeling of love, but there was nothing of love in this encounter, nor could there be, for her own sake. There was some tenderness for her youth, and pity at her situation. Rage at her manipulation of him, and fear at the magnitude of the crime he was about to commit. But overall there was a terrible lust, a need that clawed at his vitals and made him ashamed of his own manhood, even as he acknowledged its power. Hating himself, he lowered his head and cupped her face between his hands.</p><p>He kissed her softly, briefly, then a bit longer. She was trembling against him as his hands undid the tie of her gown and slid it back off her shoulders. He lifted her and laid her on the bed.</p><p>He lay beside her, cradling her in one arm as the other hand caressed her br**sts, one and then the other, cupping each so she felt the weight and the warmth of them, even as he did.</p><p>\u201cA man should pay tribute to your body,\u201d he said softly, raising each nipple with small, circling touches. \u201cFor you are beautiful, and that is your right.\u201d</p><p>She let out her breath in a small gasp, then relaxed under his touch. He took his time, moving as slowly as he could make himself do it, stroking and kissing, touching her lightly all over. He didn\u2019t like the girl, didn\u2019t want to be here, didn\u2019t want to be doing this, but\u2014it had been more than three years since he\u2019d touched a woman\u2019s body.</p> <p>He tried to gauge when she might be readiest, but how in hell could he tell? She was flushed and panting, but she simply lay there, like a piece of porcelain on display. Curse the girl, could she not even give him a clue?</p><p>He rubbed a trembling hand through his hair, trying to quell the surge of confused emotion that pulsed through him with each heartbeat. He was angry, scared, and most mightily roused, most of which feelings were of no great use to him now. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply, striving for calm, seeking for gentleness.</p><p>No, of course she couldn\u2019t show him. She\u2019d never touched a man before. Having forced him here, she was, with a damnable, unwanted, unwarrantable trust, leaving the conduct of the whole affair up to him!</p><p>He touched the girl, gently, stroking her between the thighs. She didn\u2019t part them for him, but didn\u2019t resist. She was faintly moist there. Perhaps it would be all right now?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he murmured to her. \u201cBe still, mo chridhe.\u201d Murmuring what he hoped sounded like reassurances, he eased himself on top of her, and used his knee to spread her legs. He felt her slight start at the heat of his body covering her, at the touch of his cock, and he wrapped his hands in her hair to steady her, still muttering things in soft Gaelic.</p><p>He thought dimly that it was a good thing he was speaking Gaelic, as he was no longer paying any attention at all to what he was saying. Her small, hard br**sts poked against his chest.</p> <p>\u201cMo nighean,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d said Geneva. \u201cI think perhaps...\u201d</p><p>The effort of control made him dizzy, but he did it slowly, only easing himself the barest inch within.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d said Geneva. Her eyes flew wide.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d he said, and pushed a bit farther.</p><p>\u201cStop it! It\u2019s too big! Take it out!\u201d Panicked, Geneva thrashed beneath him. Pressed beneath his chest, her br**sts wobbled and rubbed, so that his own ni**les leapt erect in pinpoints of abrupt sensation.</p><p>Her struggles were accomplishing by force what he had tried to do with gentleness. Half-dazed, he fought to keep her under him, while groping madly for something to say to calm her.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it out!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>He clapped one hand over her mouth and said the only coherent thing he could think of.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said definitely, and shoved.</p><p>What might have been a scream emerged through his fingers as a strangled \u201cEep!\u201d Geneva\u2019s eyes were huge and round, but dry.</p><p>In for a penny, in for a pound. The saying drifted absurdly through his head, leaving nothing in its wake but a jumble of incoherent alarms and a marked feeling of terrible urgency down beween them. There was precisely one thing he was capable of doing at this point, and he did it, his body ruthlessly usurping control as it moved into the rhythm of its inexorable pagan joy.</p><p>It took no more than a few thrusts before the wave came down upon him, churning down the length of his spine and erupting like a breaker striking rocks, sweeping away the last shreds of conscious thought that clung, barnacle-like, to the remnants of his mind.</p><p>He came to himself a moment later, lying on his side with the sound of his own heartbeat loud and slow in his ears. He cracked one eyelid, and saw the shimmer of pink skin in lamplight. He must see if he\u2019d hurt her much, but God, not just this minute. He shut his eye again and merely breathed.</p><p>\u201cWhat...what are you thinking?\u201d The voice sounded hesitant, and a little shaken, but not hysterical.</p><p>Too shaken himself to notice the absurdity of the question, he answered it with the truth.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering why in God\u2019s name men want to bed virgins.\u201d</p><p>There was a long moment of silence, and then a tremulous intake of breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a small voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it would hurt you too.\u201d</p><p>His eyes popped open in astonishment, and he raised himself on one elbow to find her looking at him like a startled fawn. Her face was pale, and she licked dry lips.</p><p>\u201cHurt me?\u201d he said, in blank astonishment. \u201cIt didna hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014she frowned as her eyes traveled slowly down the length of his body\u2014\u201cI thought it must. You made the most terrible face, as though it hurt awfully, and you...you groaned like a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he interrupted hastily, before she could reveal any more unflattering observations of his behavior. \u201cI didna mean...I mean...that\u2019s just how men act, when they...do that,\u201d he ended lamely.</p><p>Her shock was fading into curiosity. \u201cDo all men act like that when they\u2019re...doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I\u2014?\u201d he began irritably, then stopped himself with a shudder, realizing that he did in fact know the answer to that.</p><p>\u201cAye, they do,\u201d he said shortly. He pushed himself up to a sitting position, and brushed the hair back from his forehead. \u201cMen are disgusting horrible beasts, just as your nurse told you. Have I hurt ye badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said doubtfully. She moved her legs experimentally. \u201cIt did hurt, just for a moment, like you said it would, but it isn\u2019t so bad now.\u201d</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief as he saw that while she had bled, the stain on the towel was slight, and she seemed not to be in pain. She reached tentatively between her thighs and made a face of disgust.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all nasty and sticky!\u201d</p><p>The blood rose to his face in mingled outrage and embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he muttered, and reached for a washcloth from the stand. She didn\u2019t take it, but opened her legs and arched her back slightly, obviously expecting him to attend to the mess. He had a strong urge to stuff the rag down her throat instead, but a glance at the stand where his letter lay stopped him. It was a bargain, after all, and she\u2019d kept her part.</p><p>Grimly, he wet the cloth and began to sponge her, but he found the trust with which she presented herself to him oddly moving. He carried out his ministrations quite gently, and found himself, at the end, planting a light kiss on the smooth slope of her belly.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. She moved her hips tentatively, and reached out a hand to touch him. He didn\u2019t move, letting her fingers trail down his chest and toy with the deep indentation of his navel. The light touch hesitantly descended.</p><p>\u201cYou said...it would be better next time,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. It was a long time until the dawn.</p><p>\u201cI expect it will,\u201d he said, and stretched himself once more beside her.</p><p>\u201cJa\u2014er, Alex?\u201d</p><p>He felt as though he had been drugged, and it was an effort to answer her. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>Her arms came around his neck and she nestled her head in the curve of his shoulder, breath warm against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Alex.\u201d</p><p>With difficulty, he roused himself enough to put her away from him, holding her by the shoulders and looking down into the gray eyes, soft as a doe\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, but gently, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the third rule. You may have no more than the one night. You may not call me by my first name. And you may not love me.\u201d</p><p>The gray eyes moistened a bit. \u201cBut if I can\u2019t help it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isna love you feel now.\u201d He hoped he was right, for his sake as well as her own. \u201cIt\u2019s only the feeling I\u2019ve roused in your body. It\u2019s strong, and it\u2019s good, but it isna the same thing as love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands hard over his face. She would be a philosopher, he thought wryly. He took a deep breath and blew it out before answering her.</p><p>\u201cWell, love\u2019s for only one person. This, what you feel from me\u2014ye can have that with any man, it\u2019s not particular.\u201d</p><p>Only one person. He pushed the thought of Claire firmly away, and wearily bent again to his work.</p><p>He landed heavily in the earth of the flowerbed, not caring that he crushed several small and tender plants. He shivered. This hour before dawn was not only the darkest, but the coldest, as well, and his body strongly protested being required to rise from a warm, soft nest and venture into the chilly blackness, shielded from the icy air by no more than a thin shirt and breeks.</p><p>He remembered the heated, rosy curve of the cheek he had bent to kiss before leaving. The shapes of her lingered, warm in his hands, curving his fingers in memory, even as he groped in the dark for the darker line of the stableyard\u2019s stone wall. Drained as he was, it was a dreadful effort to haul himself up and climb over, but he couldn\u2019t risk the creak of the gate awakening Hughes, the head groom.</p><p>He felt his way across the inner yard, crowded with wagons and packed bales, ready for the journey of the Lady Geneva to the home of her new lord, following the wedding on Thursday next. At last he pushed open the stable door and found his way up the ladder to his loft. He lay down in the icy straw and pulled the single blanket over him, feeling empty of everything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>15</p><p>BY MISADVENTURE</p><p>Helwater</p><p>January 1758</p> <p>Appropriately enough, the weather was dark and stormy when the news reached Helwater. The afternoon exercise had been canceled, owing to the heavy downpour, and the horses were snug in their stalls below. The homely, peaceful sounds of munching and blowing rose up to the loft above, where Jamie Fraser reclined in a comfortable, haylined nest, an open book propped on his chest.</p><p>It was one of several he had borrowed from the estate\u2019s factor, Mr. Grieves, and he was finding it absorbing, despite the difficulty of reading by the poor light from the owl-slits beneath the eaves.</p><p>My lips, which I threw in his way, so as that he could not escape kissing them, fix\u2019d, fir\u2019d and embolden\u2019d him: and now, glancing my eyes towards that part of his dress which cover\u2019d the essential object of enjoyment, I plainly discover\u2019d the swell and commotion there; and as I was now too far advanc\u2019d to stop in so fair a way, and was indeed no longer able to contain myself, or wait the slower progress of his maiden bashfulness, I stole my hand upon his thighs, down one of which I could both see and feel a stiff hard body, confin\u2019d by his breeches, that my fingers could discover no end to.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Jamie muttered skeptically. He raised his eyebrows and shifted himself on the hay. He had been aware that books like this existed, of course, but\u2014with Jenny ordering the reading matter at Lallybroch\u2014had not encountered one personally before. The type of mental engagement demanded was somewhat different from that required for the works of Messieurs Defoe and Fielding, but he was not averse to variety.</p><p>Its prodigious size made me shrink again; yet I could not, without pleasure, behold, and even ventur\u2019d to feel, such a length, such a breadth of animated ivory! perfectly well turn\u2019d and fashion\u2019d, the proud stiffness of which distended its skin, whose smooth polish and velvet softness might vie with that of the most delicate of our sex, and whose exquisite whiteness was not a little set off by a sprout of black curling hair round the root; then the broad and blueish casted incarnate of the head, and blue serpentines of its veins, altogether compos\u2019d the most striking assemblage of figures and colors in nature. In short, it stood an object of terror and delight!</p> <p>Jamie glanced at his own crotch and snorted briefly at this, but flipped the page, the crash of thunder outside meriting no more than a twinge of his attention. He was so absorbed that at first he failed to hear the noises down below, the sound of voices drowned in the heavy rush and beat of the rain on the planks a few feet above his head.</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie!\u201d The repeated stentorian bellow finally penetrated his awareness, and he rolled hastily to his feet, quickly straightening his clothes as he went toward the ladder.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d He thrust his head over the edge of the loft to see Hughes, just opening his mouth for another bellow.</p><p>\u201cOh, there \u2019ee are.\u201d Hughes shut his mouth, and beckoned with one gnarled hand, wincing as he did so. Hughes suffered mightily from rheumatics in damp weather; he had been riding out the storm snug in the small chamber beside the tack room, where he kept a bed and a jug of crudely distilled spirits. The aroma was perceptible from the loft, and grew substantially stronger as Jamie descended the ladder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to help ready the coach to drive Lord Dunsany and Lady Isobel to Ellesmere,\u201d Hughes told him, the moment his foot touched the flags of the stable floor. The old man swayed alarmingly, hiccuping softly to himself.</p><p>\u201cNow? Are ye daft, man? Or just drunk?\u201d He glanced at the open half-door behind Hughes, which seemed a solid sheet of streaming water. Even as he looked, the sky beyond lit up with a sudden flare of lightning that threw the mountain beyond into sudden sharp relief. Just as suddenly, it disappeared, leaving its afterimage printed on his retina. He shook his head to clear the image, and saw Jeffries, the coachman, making his way across the yard, head bowed against the force of wind and water, cloak clutched tight about him. So it wasn\u2019t only a drunken fancy of Hughes\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cJeffries needs help wi\u2019 the horses!\u201d Hughes was forced to lean close and shout to be heard over the noise of the storm. The smell of rough alcohol was staggering at close distance.</p><p>\u201cAye, but why? Why must Lord Dunsany\u2014ah, feckit!\u201d The head groom\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed and bleary; clearly there was no sense to be got out of him. Disgusted, Jamie pushed past the man and mounted the ladder two rungs at a time.</p><p>A moment to wrap his own worn cloak about him, a moment more to thrust the book he had been reading under the hay\u2014stable lads were no respecters of property\u2014and he was slithering down the ladder again, and out into the roar of the storm.</p><p>It was a hellish journey. The wind screamed through the pass, striking the bulky coach and threatening to overturn it at any moment. Perched aloft beside Jeffries, a cloak was little protection against the driving rain; still less was it a help when he was forced to dismount\u2014as he did every few minutes, it seemed\u2014and put his shoulder to the wheel to free the miserable contrivance from the clinging grip of a mudhole.</p><p>Still, he scarcely noticed the physical inconvenience of the journey, preoccupied as he was with the possible reasons for it. There couldn\u2019t be many matters of such urgency as to force an old man like Lord Dunsany outside on a day like this, let alone over the rutted road to Ellesmere. Some word had come from Ellesmere, and it could only concern the Lady Geneva or her child.</p><p>Hearing through the servants\u2019 gossip that Lady Geneva was due to be delivered in January, he had counted quickly backward, cursed Geneva Dunsany once more, and then said a hasty prayer for her safe delivery. Since then, he had done his best not to think about it. He had been with her only three days before her wedding; he couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>A week before, Lady Dunsany had gone to Ellesmere to be with her daughter. Since then, she had sent daily messengers home, to fetch the dozen things she had forgotten to take and must have at once, and each of them, upon arrival at Helwater, had reported \u201cNo news yet.\u201d Now there was news, and it was plainly bad.</p><p>Passing back toward the front of the coach, after the latest battle with the mud, he saw the Lady Isobel\u2019s face peering out from beneath the isinglass sheet that covered the window.</p> <p>\u201cOh, MacKenzie!\u201d she said, her face contorted in fear and distress. \u201cPlease, is it much farther?\u201d</p><p>He leaned close to shout in her ear, over the gurgle and rush of the gullies running down both sides of the road.</p><p>\u201cJeffries says it\u2019s four mile yet, milady! Two hours, maybe.\u201d If the damned and hell-bent coach didn\u2019t tip itself and its hapless passengers off the Ashness Bridge into Watendlath Tarn, he added silently to himself.</p><p>Isobel nodded her thanks, and lowered the window, but not before he had seen that the wetness upon her cheeks was due as much to tears as to the rain. The snake of anxiety wrapped round his heart slithered lower, to twist in his guts.</p><p>It was closer to three hours by the time the coach rolled at last into the courtyard at Ellesmere. Without hesitation, Lord Dunsany leapt down and, scarcely pausing to give his younger daughter an arm, hurried into the house.</p><p>It took nearly another hour to unharness the team, rub down the horses, wash the caked-on mud from the coach\u2019s wheels, and put everything away in Ellesmere\u2019s stables. Numb with cold, fatigue, and hunger, he and Jeffries sought refuge and sustenance in Ellesmere\u2019s kitchens.</p><p>\u201cPoor fellows, you\u2019re gone right blue wi\u2019 the cold,\u201d the cook observed. \u201cSit ye down \u2019ere, and I\u2019ll soon \u2019ave yer a hot bite.\u201d A sharp-faced, spare-framed woman, her figure belied her skill, for within minutes, a huge, savoury omelet was laid before them, garnished with liberal amounts of bread and butter, and a small pot of jam.</p><p>\u201cFair, quite fair,\u201d Jeffries pronounced, casting an appreciative eye on the spread. He winked at the cook. \u201cNot as it wouldn\u2019 go down easier wi\u2019 a drop o\u2019 something to pave the way, eh? You look the sort would have mercy on a pair o\u2019 poor half-frozen chaps, wouldn\u2019t ye, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Whether it was this piece of Irish persuasion or the sight of their dripping, steaming clothes, the argument had its effect, and a bottle of cooking brandy made its appearance next to the peppermill. Jeffries poured a large tot and drank it off without hesitation, smacking his lips.</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s more like! Here, boyo.\u201d He passed the bottle to Jamie, then settled himself comfortably to a hot meal and gossip with the female servants. \u201cWell, then, what\u2019s to do here? Is the babe born yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, last night!\u201d the kitchen maid said eagerly. \u201cWe were up all night, with the doctor comin\u2019, and fresh sheets and towels called for, and the house all topsle-turvy. But the babe\u2019s the least of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d the cook broke in, frowning censoriously. \u201cThere\u2019s too much work to be standin\u2019 about gossiping. Get yer on, Mary Ann-up to the study, and see if his Lordship\u2019ll be wantin\u2019 anything else served now.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, wiping his plate with a slice of bread, observed that the maid, far from being abashed at this rebuke, departed with alacrity, causing him to deduce that something of considerable interest was likely transpiring in the study.</p><p>The undivided attention of her audience thus obtained, the cook allowed herself to be persuaded into imparting the gossip with no more than a token demur.</p><p>\u201cWell, it started some months ago, when the Lady Geneva started to show, poor thing. His Lordship\u2019d been nicer than pie to \u2019er, ever since they was married couldn\u2019t do enough for \u2019er, anything she wanted ordered from Lunnon, always askin\u2019 was she warm enough,\u2019ad she what she wanted to eat\u2014fair dotin\u2019, \u2019is Lordship was. But then, when \u2019e found she was with child!\u201d The cook paused, to screw up her face portentously.</p><p>Jamie wanted desperately to know about the child; what was it, and how did it fare? There seemed no way to hurry the woman, though, so he composed his face to look as interested as possible, leaning forward encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy, the shouting, and the carryings-on!\u201d the cook said, throwing up her hands in dismayed illustration, \u201c\u2019im shoutin\u2019, and \u2019er cryin\u2019, and the both of \u2019em stampin\u2019 up and down and slammin\u2019 doors, and \u2019im callin\u2019 \u2019er names as isn\u2019t fit to be used in a stableyard\u2014and so I told Mary Ann, when she told me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas his lordship not pleased about the child, then?\u201d Jamie interrupted. The omelet was settling into a hard lump somewhere under his breastbone. He took another gulp of brandy, in hopes of dislodging it.</p><p>The cook turned a bright, birdlike eye on him, eyebrow cocked in appreciation at his intelligence. \u201cWell, you\u2019d think as \u2019e would be, wouldn\u2019t yer? But no indeed! Far from it,\u201d she added with emphasis.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Jeffries, only mildly interested.</p><p>\u201c\u2019E said,\u201d the cook said, dropping her voice in awe at the scandalousness of the information, \u201cas the child wasn\u2019t \u2019is!\u201d</p><p>Jeffries, well along with his second glass, snorted in contemptuous amusement. \u201cOld goat with a young gel? I should think it like enough, but how on earth would his Lordship know for sure whose the spawn was? Could be his as much as anyone\u2019s, couldn\u2019t it, with only her ladyship\u2019s word to go by, eh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cook\u2019s thin mouth stretched in a bright, malicious smile. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t say as \u2019e\u2019d know whose it was, now\u2014but there\u2019s one sure way \u2019e\u2019d know it wasn\u2019t \u2019is, now isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Jeffries stared at the cook, tilting back on his chair. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cYou mean to tell me his Lordship\u2019s incapable?\u201d A broad grin at this juicy thought split his weatherbeaten face. Jamie felt the omelet rising, and hastily gulped more brandy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t say, I\u2019m sure.\u201d The cook\u2019s mouth assumed a prim line, then split asunder to add, \u201cthough the chambermaid did say as the sheets she took off the weddin\u2019 bed was as white as when they\u2019d gone on, to be sure.\u201d</p><p>It was too much. Interrupting Jeffries\u2019s delighted cackle, Jamie set down his glass with a thump, and bluntly said, \u201cDid the child live?\u201d</p> <p>The cook and Jeffries both stared in astonishment, but the cook, after a moment\u2019s startlement, nodded in answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, to be sure. Fine \u2019ealthy little lad,\u2019e is, too, or so I \u2019ear. I thought you knew a\u2019ready. It\u2019s \u2019is mother that\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>That blunt statement struck the kitchen with silence. Even Jeffries was still for a moment, sobered by death. Then he crossed himself quickly, muttered, \u201cGod rest her soul,\u201d and swallowed the rest of his brandy.</p><p>Jamie could feel his own throat burning, whether with brandy or tears, he could not say. Shock and grief choked him like a ball of yarn wedged in his gullet; he could barely manage to croak, \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d the cook said, wagging her head mournfully. \u201cJust afore noon, poor girl. They thought for a time as she\u2019d be all right, after the babe was born; Mary Ann said she was sittin\u2019 up, holdin\u2019 the wee thing and laughin\u2019.\u201d She sighed heavily at the thought. \u201cBut then near dawn, she started to bleed again bad. They called back the doctor, and he came fast as could be, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The door slamming open interrupted her. It was Mary Ann, eyes wide under her cap, gasping with excitement and exertion.</p><p>\u201cYour master wants you!\u201d she blurted out, eyes flicking between Jamie and the coachman. \u201cThe both of ye, at once, and oh, sir\u201d\u2014she gulped, nodding at Jeffries\u2014\u201che says for God\u2019s sake, to bring your pistols!\u201d</p><p>The coachman exchanged a glance of consternation with Jamie, then leapt to his feet and dashed out, in the direction of the stables. Like most coachmen, he carried a pair of loaded pistols beneath his seat, against the possibility of highwaymen.</p><p>It would take Jeffries a few minutes to find the arms, and longer if he waited to check that the priming had not been harmed by the wet weather. Jamie rose to his feet and gripped the dithering maidservant by the arm.</p><p>\u201cShow me to the study,\u201d he said. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>The sound of raised voices would have led him there, once he had reached the head of the stair. Pushing past Mary Ann without ceremony, he paused for a moment outside the door, uncertain whether he should enter at once, or wait for Jeffries.</p> <p>\u201cThat you can have the sheer heartless effrontery to make such accusations!\u201d Dunsany was saying, his old man\u2019s voice shaking with rage and distress. \u201cAnd my poor lamb not cold in her bed! You blackguard, you poltroon! I will not suffer the child to stay a single night under your roof!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little bastard stays here!\u201d Ellesmere\u2019s voice rasped hoarsely. It would have been apparent to a far less experienced observer that his Lordship was well the worse for drink. \u201cBastard that he is, he\u2019s my heir, and he stays with me! He\u2019s bought and paid for, and if his dam was a whore, at least she gave me a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Dunsany\u2019s voice had reached such a pitch of shrillness that it was scarcely more than a squeak, but the outrage in it was clear nonetheless. \u201cBought? You\u2014you\u2014you dare to suggest...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suggest.\u201d Ellesmere\u2019s voice was still hoarse, but under better control. \u201cYou sold me your daughter\u2014and under false pretenses, I might add,\u201d the hoarse voice said sarcastically. \u201cI paid thirty thousand pound for a virgin of good name. The first condition wasn\u2019t met, and I take leave to doubt the second.\u201d The sound of liquid being poured came through the door, followed by the scrape of a glass across a wooden tabletop.</p><p>\u201cI would suggest that your burden of spirits is already excessive, sir,\u201d Dunsany said. His voice shook with an obvious attempt at mastery of his emotions. \u201cI can only attribute the disgusting slurs you have cast upon my daughter\u2019s purity to your apparent intoxication. That being so, I shall take my grandson, and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your grandson, is it?\u201d Ellesmere\u2019s voice was slurred and sneering. \u201cYou seem damned sure of your daughter\u2019s \u2018purity.\u2019 Sure the brat isn\u2019t yours? She said\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off with a cry of astonishment, accompanied by a crash. Not daring to wait longer, Jamie plunged through the door, to find Ellesmere and Lord Dunsany entangled on the hearthrug, rolling to and fro in a welter of coats and limbs, both heedless of the fire behind them.</p><p>He took a moment to appraise the situation, then, seizing a fortuitous opening, reached into the fray and snatched his employer upright.</p> <p>\u201cBe still, my lord,\u201d he muttered in Dunsany\u2019s ear, dragging him back from Ellesmere\u2019s gasping form. Then, \u201cGive over, ye auld fool!\u201d he hissed, as Dunsany went on mindlessly struggling to reach his opponent. Ellesmere was almost as old as Dunsany, but more strongly built and clearly in better health, despite his drunkenness.</p><p>The Earl staggered to his feet, balding hair disheveled and bloodshot eyes glaring fixedly at Dunsany. He wiped his spittle-flecked mouth with the back of his hand, fat shoulders heaving.</p><p>\u201cFilth,\u201d he said, almost conversationally. \u201cLay hands...on me, would you?\u201d Still gasping for breath, he lurched toward the bell rope.</p><p>It was by no means certain that Lord Dunsany would stay on his feet, but there was no time to worry about that. Jamie let go of his employer, and lunged for Ellesmere\u2019s groping hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, my lord,\u201d he said, as respectfully as possible. Holding Ellesmere in a crude bear-leading embrace, he forced the heavyset Earl back across the room. \u201cI think it would be...unwise...to involve your...servants.\u201d Grunting, he pushed Ellesmere into a chair.</p><p>\u201cBest stay there, my lord.\u201d Jeffries, a drawn pistol in each hand, advanced warily into the room, his darting glance divided between Ellesmere, struggling to rise from the depths of the armchair, and Lord Dunsany, who clung precariously to a table edge, his aged face white as paper.</p><p>Jeffries glanced at Dunsany for instructions, and seeing none forthcoming, instinctively looked to Jamie. Jamie was conscious of a monstrous irritation; why should he be expected to deal with this imbroglio? Still, it was important that the Helwater party remove themselves from the premises with all haste. He stepped forward and took Dunsany by the arm.</p><p>\u201cLet us go now, my lord,\u201d he said. Detaching the wilting Dunsany from the table, he tried to edge the tall old nobleman toward the door. Just at this moment of escape, though, the door was blocked.</p><p>\u201cWilliam?\u201d Lady Dunsany\u2019s round face, splotched with the marks of recent grief, showed a sort of dull bewilderment at the scene in the study. In her arms was what looked like a large, untidy bundle of washing. She lifted this in a movement of vague inquiry. \u201cThe maid said you wanted me to bring the baby. What\u2014\u201d A roar from Ellesmere interrupted her. Heedless of the pointing pistols, the Earl sprang from his chair and shoved the gawking Jeffries out of the way.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine!\u201d Knocking Lady Dunsany roughly against the paneling, Ellesmere snatched the bundle from her arms. Clutching it to his bosom, the Earl retreated toward the window. He glared at Dunsany, panting like a cornered beast.</p><p>\u201cMine, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d</p><p>The bundle emitted a loud shriek, as if in protest at this asseveration, and Dunsany, roused from his shock by the sight of his grandson in Ellesmere\u2019s arms, started forward, his features contorted in fury.</p><p>\u201cGive him to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, you codless scut!\u201d With an unforeseen agility, Ellesmere dodged away from Dunsany. He flung back the draperies and cranked the window open with one hand, clutching the wailing child with the other.</p><p>\u201cGet\u2014out\u2014of\u2014my\u2014house!\u201d he panted, gasping with each revolution that edged the casement wider. \u201cGo! Now, or I\u2019ll drop the little bastard, I swear I will!\u201d To mark his threat, he thrust the yelling bundle toward the sill, and the empty dark where the wet stones of the courtyard waited, thirty feet below.</p><p>Past all conscious thought or any fear of consequence, Jamie Fraser acted on the instinct that had seen him through a dozen battles. He snatched one pistol from the transfixed Jeffries, turned on his heel, and fired in the same motion.</p><p>The roar of the shot struck everyone silent. Even the child ceased to scream. Ellesmere\u2019s face went quite blank, thick eyebrows raised in question. Then he staggered, and Jamie leapt forward, noting with a sort of detached clarity the small round hole in the baby\u2019s trailing drapery, where the pistol ball had passed through it.</p><p>He stood then rooted on the hearthrug, heedless of the fire scorching the backs of his legs, of the still-heaving body of Ellesmere at his feet, of the regular, hysterical shrieks of Lady Dunsany, piercing as a peacock\u2019s. He stood, eyes tight closed, shaking like a leaf, unable either to move or to think, arms wrapped tight about the shapeless, squirming, squawking bundle that contained his son.</p><p>\u201cI wish to speak to MacKenzie. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Lady Dunsany looked distinctly out of place in the stable. Small, plump, and impeccable in black linen, she looked like a china ornament, removed from its spot of cherished safety on the mantelpiece, and in imminent and constant peril of breakage, here in this world of rough animals and unshaven men.</p><p>Hughes, with a glance of complete astonishment at his mistress, bowed and tugged at his forelock before retreating to his den behind the tack room, leaving MacKenzie face-to-face with her.</p><p>Close to, the impression of fragility was heightened by the paleness of her face, touched faintly with pink at the corners of nose and eyes. She looked like a very small and dignified rabbit, dressed in mourning. Jamie felt that he should ask her to sit down, but there was no place for her to sit, save on a pile of hay or an upturned barrow.</p><p>\u201cThe coroner\u2019s court met this morning, MacKenzie,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAye, milady.\u201d He had known that\u2014they all had, and the other grooms had kept their distance from him all morning. Not out of respect; out of the dread for one who suffers from a deadly disease. Jeffries knew what had happened in the drawing room at Ellesmere, and that meant all the servants knew. But no one spoke of it.</p><p>\u201cThe verdict of the court was that the Earl of Ellesmere met his death by misadventure. The coroner\u2019s theory is that his lordship was\u2014distraught\u201d\u2014she made a faint moue of distaste\u2014\u201cover my daughter\u2019s death.\u201d Her voice quivered faintly, but did not break. The fragile Lady Dunsany had borne up much better beneath the tragedy than had her husband; the servants\u2019 rumor had it that his lordship had not risen from his bed since his return from Ellesmere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, milady?\u201d Jeffries had been called to give evidence. MacKenzie had not. So far as the coroner\u2019s court was concerned, the groom MacKenzie had never set foot on Ellesmere.</p><p>Lady Dunsany\u2019s eyes met his, straight on. They were a pale bluish-green, like her daughter Isobel\u2019s, but the blond hair that glowed on Isobel was faded on her mother, touched with white strands that shone silver in the sun from the open door of the stable.</p><p>\u201cWe are grateful to you, MacKenzie,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank ye, milady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery grateful,\u201d she repeated, still gazing at him intently. \u201cMacKenzie isn\u2019t your real name, is it?\u201d she said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cNo, milady.\u201d A sliver of ice ran down his spine, despite the warmth of the afternoon sun on his shoulders. How much had the Lady Geneva told her mother before her death?</p><p>She seemed to feel his stiffening, for the edge of her mouth lifted in what he thought was meant as a smile of reassurance.</p><p>\u201cI think I need not ask what it is, just yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do have a question for you. MacKenzie\u2014do you want to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d He repeated the word blankly.</p> <p>\u201cTo Scotland.\u201d She was watching him intently. \u201cI know who you are,\u201d she said. \u201cNot your name, but that you\u2019re one of John\u2019s Jacobite prisoners. My husband told me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie watched her warily, but she didn\u2019t seem upset; no more so than would be natural in a woman who has just lost a daughter and gained a grandson, at least.</p><p>\u201cI hope you will forgive the deception, milady,\u201d he said. \u201cHis Lordship\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWished to save me distress,\u201d Lady Dunsany finished for him. \u201cYes, I know. William worries too much.\u201d Still, the deep line between her brows relaxed a bit at the thought of her husband\u2019s concern. The sight, with its underlying echo of marital devotion, gave him a faint and unexpected pang.</p><p>\u201cWe are not rich\u2014you will have gathered that from Ellesmere\u2019s remarks,\u201d Lady Dunsany went on. \u201cHelwater is rather heavily in debt. My grandson, however, is now the possessor of one of the largest fortunes in the county.\u201d</p><p>There seemed nothing to say to this but \u201cAye, milady?\u201d though it made him feel rather like the parrot who lived in the main salon. He had seen it as he crept stealthily through the flowerbeds at sunset the day before, taking the chance of approaching the house while the family were dressing for dinner, in an attempt to catch a glimpse through a window of the new Earl of Ellesmere.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very retired here,\u201d she went on. \u201cWe seldom visit London, and my husband has little influence in high circles. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, milady?\u201d He had some inkling by now of where her ladyship was heading with this roundabout conversation, and a feeling of sudden excitement hollowed the space beneath his ribs.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2014Lord John Grey, that is\u2014comes from a family with considerable influence. His stepfather is\u2014well, that\u2019s of no consequence.\u201d She shrugged, the small black-linen shoulders dismissing the details.</p><p>\u201cThe point is that it might be possible to exert sufficient influence on your behalf to have you released from the conditions of your parole, so that you might return to Scotland. So I have come to ask you\u2014do you want to go home, MacKenzie?\u201d</p><p>He felt quite breathless, as though someone had punched him very hard in the stomach.</p><p>Scotland. To go away from this damp, spongy atmosphere, set foot on that forbidden road and walk it with a free, long stride, up into the crags and along the deer trails, to feel the air clearing and sharpening with the scent of gorse and heather. To go home!</p><p>To be a stranger no longer. To go away from hostility and loneliness, come down into Lallybroch, and see his sister\u2019s face light with joy at the sight of him, feel her arms around his waist, Ian\u2019s hug about his shoulders and the pummeling, grasping clutch of the children\u2019s hands, tugging at his clothes.</p><p>To go away, and never to see or hear of his own child again. He stared at Lady Dunsany, his face quite blank, so that she should not guess at the turmoil her offer had caused within him.</p> <p>He had, at last, found the baby yesterday, lying asleep in a basket near the nursery window on the second floor. Perched precariously on the branch of a huge Norway spruce, he had strained his eyes to see through the screen of needles that hid him.</p><p>The child\u2019s face had been visible only in profile, one fat cheek resting on its ruffled shoulder. Its cap had slipped awry, so he could see the smooth, arching curve of the tiny skull, lightly dusted with a pale gold fuzz.</p><p>\u201cThank God it isn\u2019t red,\u201d had been his first thought, and he had crossed himself in reflexive thanksgiving.</p><p>\u201cGod, he\u2019s so small!\u201d had been his second, coupled with an overwhelming urge to step through the window and pick the boy up. The smooth, beautifully shaped head would just fit, resting in the palm of his hand, and he could feel in memory the small squirming body that he had held so briefly to his heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strong laddie,\u201d he had whispered. \u201cStrong and braw and bonny. But my God, you are so small!\u201d</p><p>Lady Dunsany was waiting patiently. He bowed his head respectfully to her, not knowing whether he was making a terrible mistake, but unable to do otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, milady, but\u2014I think I shall not go...just yet.\u201d</p><p>One pale eyebrow quivered slightly, but she inclined her head to him with equal grace.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, MacKenzie. You have only to ask.\u201d</p><p>She turned like a tiny clockwork figure and left, going back to the world of Helwater, a thousand times more his prison now than it had ever been.</p><p>16</p><p>WILLIE</p><p>To his extreme surprise, the next few years were in many ways among the happiest of Jamie Fraser\u2019s life, aside from the years of his marriage.</p><p>Relieved of responsibility for tenants, followers, or anyone at all beyond himself and the horses in his charge, life was relatively simple. While the coroner\u2019s court had taken no notice of him, Jeffries had let slip enough about the death of Ellesmere that the other servants treated him with distant respect, but did not presume on his company.</p><p>He had enough to eat, sufficient clothes to keep warm and decent, and the occasional discreet letter from the Highlands reassured him that similar conditions obtained there.</p><p>One unexpected benefit of the quiet life at Helwater was that he had somehow resumed his odd half-friendship with Lord John Grey. The Major had, as promised, appeared once each quarter, staying each time for a few days to visit with the Dunsanys. He had made no attempt to gloat, though, or even to speak with Jamie, beyond the barest formal inquiry.</p><p>Very slowly, Jamie had realized all that Lady Dunsany had implied, in her offer to have him released. \u201cJohn\u2014Lord John Grey, that is\u2014comes from a family with considerable influence. His stepfather is\u2014well, that\u2019s of no consequence,\u201d she had said. It was of consequence, though. It had not been His Majesty\u2019s pleasure that had brought him here, rather than condemning him to the perilous ocean crossing and near-slavery in America; it had been John Grey\u2019s influence.</p><p>And he had not done it for revenge or from indecent motives, for he never gloated, made no advances; never said anything beyond the most commonplace civilities. No, he had brought Jamie here because it was the best he could do; unable simply to release him at the time, Grey had done his best to ease the conditions of captivity\u2014by giving him air, and light, and horses.</p><p>It took some effort, but he did it. When Grey next appeared in the stableyard on his quarterly visit, Jamie had waited until the Major was alone, admiring the conformation of a big sorrel gelding. He had come to stand beside Grey, leaning on the fence. They watched the horse in silence for several minutes.</p><p>\u201cKing\u2019s pawn to king four,\u201d Jamie said quietly at last, not looking at the man beside him.</p><p>He felt the other\u2019s start of surprise, and felt Grey\u2019s eyes on him, but didn\u2019t turn his head. Then he felt the creak of the wood beneath his forearm as Grey turned back, leaning on the fence again.</p><p>\u201cQueen\u2019s knight to queen bishop three,\u201d Grey replied, his voice a little huskier than usual.</p><p>Since then, Grey had come to the stables during each visit, to spend an evening perched on Jamie\u2019s crude stool, talking. They had no chessboard and seldom played verbally, but the late-night conversations continued\u2014Jamie\u2019s only connection with the world beyond Helwater, and a small pleasure to which both of them looked forward once each quarter.</p><p>Above everything else, he had Willie. Helwater was dedicated to horses; even before the boy could stand solidly on his feet, his grandfather had him propped on a pony to be led round the paddock. By the time Willie was three, he was riding by himself\u2014under the watchful eye of MacKenzie, the groom.</p><p>Willie was a strong, courageous, bonny little lad. He had a blinding smile, and could charm birds from the trees if he liked. He was also remarkably spoilt. As the ninth Earl of Ellesmere and the only heir to both Ellesmere and Helwater, with neither mother nor father to keep him under control, he ran roughshod over his doting grandparents, his young aunt, and every servant in the place\u2014except MacKenzie.</p><p>And that was a near thing. So far, threats of not allowing the boy to help him with the horses had sufficed to quash Willie\u2019s worst excesses in the stables, but sooner or later, threats alone were not going to be sufficient, and MacKenzie the groom found himself wondering just what was going to happen when he finally lost his own control and clouted the wee fiend.</p><p>As a lad, he would himself have been beaten senseless by the nearest male relative within earshot, had he ever dared to address a woman the way he had heard Willie speak to his aunt and the maidservants, and the impulse to haul Willie into a deserted box stall and attempt to correct his manners was increasingly frequent.</p><p>Still, for the most part, he had nothing but joy in Willie. The boy adored MacKenzie, and as he grew older would spend hours in his company, riding on the huge draft horses as they pulled the heavy roller through the high fields, and perched precariously on the hay wagons as they came down from the upper pastures in summer.</p><p>There was a threat to this peaceful existence, though, which grew greater with each passing month. Ironically, the threat came from Willie himself, and was one he could not help.</p><p>\u201cWhat a handsome little lad he is, to be sure! And such a lovely little rider!\u201d It was Lady Grozier who spoke, standing on the veranda with Lady Dunsany to admire Willie\u2019s peregrinations on his pony around the edge of the lawn.</p><p>Willie\u2019s grandmother laughed, eyeing the boy fondly. \u201cOh, yes. He loves his pony. We have a terrible time getting him even to come indoors for meals. And he\u2019s even more fond of his groom. We joke sometimes that he spends so much time with MacKenzie that he\u2019s even starting to look like MacKenzie!\u201d</p><p>Lady Grozier, who had of course paid no attention to a groom, now glanced in MacKenzie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you\u2019re right!\u201d she exclaimed, much amused. \u201cJust look; Willie\u2019s got just that same c**k to his head, and the same set to his shoulders! How funny!\u201d</p><p>Jamie bowed respectfully to the ladies, but felt cold sweat pop out on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had seen this coming, but hadn\u2019t wanted to believe the resemblance was sufficiently pronounced as to be visible to anyone but himself. Willie as a baby had been fat and pudding-faced, and resembled no one at all. As he had grown, though, the pudginess had vanished from cheeks and chin, and while his nose was still the soft snub of childhood, the hint of high, broad cheekbones was apparent, and the slaty-blue eyes of babyhood had grown dark blue and clear, thickly fringed with sooty lashes, and slightly slanted in appearance.</p><p>Once the ladies had gone into the house, and he could be sure no one was watching, Jamie passed a hand furtively over his own features. Was the resemblance truly that great? Willie\u2019s hair was a soft middle brown, with just a tinge of his mother\u2019s chestnut gleam. And those large, translucent ears\u2014surely his own didn\u2019t stick out like that?</p><p>The trouble was that Jamie Fraser had not actually seen himself clearly for several years. Grooms did not have looking glasses, and he had sedulously avoided the company of the maids, who might have provided him with one.</p><p>Moving to the watering trough, he bent over it, casually, as though inspecting one of the water striders that skated over its surface. Beneath the wavering surface, flecked with floating bits of hay and crisscrossed by the dimpling striders, his own face stared up at him.</p> <p>He swallowed, and saw the reflection\u2019s throat move. It was by no means a complete resemblance, but it was definitely there. More in the set and shape of the head and shoulders, as Lady Grozier had observed\u2014but most definitely the eyes as well. Fraser eyes; his father, Brian, had had them, and his sister, Jenny, as well. Let the boy\u2019s bones go on pressing through his skin; let the child-snub nose grow long and straight, and the cheekbones still broader\u2014and anyone would be able to see it.</p><p>The reflection in the trough vanished as he straightened up, and stood, staring blindly at the stable that had been home for the last several years. It was July and the sun was hot, but it made no impression on the chill that numbed his fingers and sent a shiver up his back.</p><p>It was time to speak to Lady Dunsany.</p><p>By the middle of September, everything had been arranged. The pardon had been procured; John Grey had brought it the day before. Jamie had a small amount of money saved, enough for traveling expenses, and Lady Dunsany had given him a decent horse. The only thing that remained was to bid farewell to his acquaintances at Helwater\u2014and Willie.</p><p>\u201cI shall be leaving tomorrow.\u201d Jamie spoke matter-of-factly, not taking his eyes off the bay mare\u2019s fetlock. The horny growth he was filing flaked away, leaving a dust of coarse black shavings on the stable floor.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going? To Derwentwater? Can I come with you?\u201d William, Viscount Dunsany, ninth Earl of Ellesmere, hopped down from the edge of the box stall, landing with a thump that made the bay mare start and snort.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d Jamie said automatically. \u201cHave I not told ye to move quiet near Milly? She\u2019s skittish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be skittish, too, if I squeezed your knee.\u201d One big hand darted out and pinched the muscle just above the boy\u2019s knee. Willie squeaked and jerked back, giggling.</p><p>\u201cCan I ride Millyflower when you\u2019re done, Mac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie answered patiently, for the dozenth time that day. \u201cI\u2019ve told ye a thousand times, she\u2019s too big for ye yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I want to ride her!\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed but didn\u2019t answer, instead moving around to the other side of Milles Fleurs and picking up the left hoof.</p><p>\u201cI said I want to ride Milly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen saddle her for me! Right now!\u201d</p><p>The ninth Earl of Ellesmere had his chin thrust out as far as it would go, but the defiant look in his eye was tempered with a certain doubt as he intercepted Jamie\u2019s cold blue gaze. Jamie set the horse\u2019s hoof down slowly, just as slowly stood up, and drawing himself to his full height of six feet four, put his hands on his hips, looked down at the Earl, three feet six, and said, very softly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Willie stamped his foot on the hay-strewn floor. \u201cYou have to do what I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I...\u201d Shaking his head hard enough to make the red hair fly about his ears, Jamie pressed his lips tight together, then squatted down in front of the boy.</p><p>\u201cSee here,\u201d he said, \u201cI havena got to do what ye say, for I\u2019m no longer going to be groom here. I told ye, I shall be leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Willie\u2019s face went quite blank with shock, and the freckles on his nose stood out dark against the fair skin.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The small Earl clenched his jaw, which gave him a truly startling resemblance to his paternal great-grandfather. Jamie thanked his stars that no one at Helwater had likely ever seen Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once, my lord, ye have nothing to say about it,\u201d Jamie replied firmly, his distress at leaving tempered somewhat by finally being allowed to speak his mind to the boy.</p><p>\u201cIf you leave...\u201d Willie looked around helplessly for a threat, and spotted one easily to hand. \u201cIf you leave,\u201d he repeated more confidently, \u201cI\u2019ll scream and shout and scare all the horses, so there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a peep, ye little fiend, and I\u2019ll smack ye a good one!\u201d Freed from his usual reserve, and alarmed at the thought of this spoiled brat upsetting the highly-strung and valuable horses, Jamie glared at the boy.</p><p>The Earl\u2019s eyes bulged with rage, and his face went red. He took a deep breath, then whirled and ran down the length of the stable, shrieking and waving his arms.</p><p>Milles Fleurs, already on edge from having her hoofs fiddled with, reared and plunged, neighing loudly. Her distress was echoed by kicks and high-pitched whinnying from the box stalls nearby, where Willie was roaring out all the bad words he knew\u2014no small store\u2014and kicking frenziedly at the doors of the stalls.</p><p>Jamie succeeded in catching Milles Fleurs\u2019s lead-rope and with considerable effort, managed to get the mare outside without damage to himself or the horse. He tied her to the paddock fence, and then strode back into the stable to deal with Willie.</p><p>\u201cDamn, damn, damn!\u201d the Earl was shrieking. \u201cSluire! Quim! Shit! Swive!\u201d</p><p>Without a word, Jamie grabbed the boy by the collar, lifted him off his feet and carried him, kicking and squirming, to the farrier\u2019s stool he had been using. Here he sat down, flipped the Earl over his knee, and smacked his bu**ocks five or six times, hard. Then he jerked the boy up and set him on his feet.</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d The Viscount\u2019s tear-smudged face was bright red and his fists trembled with rage.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m no verra fond of you either, ye little bastard!\u201d Jamie snapped.</p><p>Willie drew himself up, fists clenched, purple in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bastard!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not! Take it back! Nobody can say that to me! Take it back, I said!\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared at the boy in shock. There had been talk, then, and Willie had heard it. He had delayed his going too long.</p><p>He drew a deep breath, and then another, and hoped that his voice would not tremble.</p><p>\u201cI take it back,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI shouldna have used the word, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to kneel and embrace the boy, or pick him up and comfort him against his shoulder\u2014but that was not a gesture a groom might make to an earl, even a young one. The palm of his left hand stung, and he curled his fingers tight over the only fatherly caress he was ever likely to give his son.</p><p>Willie knew how an earl should behave; he was making a masterful effort to subdue his tears, sniffing ferociously and swiping at his face with a sleeve.</p><p>\u201cAllow me, my lord.\u201d Jamie did kneel then, and wiped the little boy\u2019s face gently with his own coarse handkerchief. Willie\u2019s eyes looked at him over the cotton folds, red-rimmed and woeful.</p><p>\u201cHave you really got to go, Mac?\u201d he asked, in a very small voice.</p><p>\u201cAye, I have.\u201d He looked into the dark blue eyes, so heartbreakingly like his own, and suddenly didn\u2019t give a damn what was right or who saw. He pulled the boy roughly to him, hugging him tight against his heart, holding the boy\u2019s face close to his shoulder, that Willie might not see the quick tears that fell into his thick, soft hair.</p><p>Willie\u2019s arms went around his neck and clung tight. He could feel the small, sturdy body shake against him with the force of suppressed sobbing. He patted the flat little back, and smoothed Willie\u2019s hair, and murmured things in Gaelic that he hoped the boy would not understand.</p><p>At length, he took the boy\u2019s arms from his neck and put him gently away.</p><p>\u201cCome wi\u2019 me to my room, Willie; I shall give ye something to keep.\u201d</p><p>He had long since moved from the hayloft, taking over Hughes\u2019s snuggery beside the tack room when the elderly head groom retired. It was a small room, and very plainly furnished, but it had the twin virtues of warmth and privacy.</p><p>Besides the bed, the stool, and a chamber pot, there was a small table, on which stood the few books that he owned, a large candle in a pottery candlestick, and a smaller candle, thick and squat, that stood to one side before a small statue of the Virgin. It was a cheap wooden carving that Jenny had sent him, but it had been made in France, and was not without artistry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that little candle for?\u201d Willie asked. \u201cGrannie says only stinking Papists burn candles in front of heathen images.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am a stinking Papist,\u201d Jamie said, with a wry twist of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s no a heathen image, though; it\u2019s a statue of the Blessed Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Clearly this revelation only added to the boy\u2019s fascination. \u201cWhy do Papists burn candles before statues, then?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cAye, well. It\u2019s...maybe a way of praying\u2014and remembering. Ye light the candle, and say a prayer and think of people ye care for. And while it burns, the flame remembers them for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you remember?\u201d Willie glanced up at him. His hair was standing on end, rumpled by his earlier distress, but his blue eyes were clear with interest.</p><p>\u201cOh, a good many people. My family in the Highlands\u2014my sister and her family. Friends. My wife.\u201d And sometimes the candle burned in memory of a young and reckless girl named Geneva, but he did not say that.</p><p>Willie frowned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not anymore. But I remember her always.\u201d</p><p>Willie put out a stubby forefinger and cautiously touched the little statue. The woman\u2019s hands were spread in welcome, a tender maternity engraved on the lovely face.</p><p>\u201cI want to be a stinking Papist, too,\u201d Willie said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYe canna do that!\u201d Jamie exclaimed, half-amused, half-touched at the notion. \u201cYour grandmama and your auntie would go mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould they froth at the mouth, like that mad fox you killed?\u201d Willie brightened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI shouldna wonder,\u201d Jamie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI want to do it!\u201d The small, clear features were set in determination. \u201cI won\u2019t tell Grannie or Auntie Isobel; I won\u2019t tell anybody. Please, Mac! Please let me! I want to be like you!\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated, both touched by the boy\u2019s earnestness, and suddenly wanting to leave his son with something more than the carved wooden horse he had made to leave as a farewell present. He tried to remember what Father McMurtry had taught them in the schoolroom about baptism. It was all right for a lay person to do it, he thought, provided that the situation was an emergency, and no priest was to hand.</p><p>It might be stretching a point to call the present situation an emergency, but...a sudden impulse made him reach down the jug of water that he kept on the sill.</p> <p>The eyes that were like his watched, wide and solemn, as he carefully brushed the soft brown hair back from the high brow. He dipped three fingers into the water and carefully traced a cross on the lad\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cI baptize thee William James,\u201d he said softly, \u201cin the name o\u2019 the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.\u201d</p><p>Willie blinked, crossing his eyes as a drop of water rolled down his nose. He stuck out his tongue to catch it, and Jamie laughed, despite himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call me William James?\u201d Willie asked curiously. \u201cMy other names are Clarence Henry George.\u201d He made a face; Clarence wasn\u2019t his idea of a good name.</p><p>Jamie hid a smile. \u201cYe get a new name when you\u2019re baptized; James is your special Papist name. It\u2019s mine, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Willie was delighted. \u201cI\u2019m a stinking Papist now, like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, as much as I can manage, at least.\u201d He smiled down at Willie, then, struck by another impulse, reached into the neck of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHere. Keep this, too, to remember me by.\u201d He laid the beechwood rosary gently over Willie\u2019s head. \u201cYe canna let anyone see that, though,\u201d he warned. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, dinna tell anyone you\u2019re a Papist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Willie promised. \u201cNot a soul.\u201d He tucked the rosary into his shirt, patting carefully to be sure that it was hidden.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jamie reached out and ruffled Willie\u2019s hair in dismissal. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for your tea; ye\u2019d best go on up to the house now.\u201d</p><p>Willie started for the door, but stopped halfway, suddenly distressed again, with a hand pressed flat to his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou said to keep this to remember you. But I haven\u2019t got anything for you to remember me by!\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled slightly. His heart was squeezed so tight, he thought he could not draw breath to speak, but he forced the words out.</p><p>\u201cDinna fret yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll remember ye.\u201d</p><p>17</p><p>MONSTERS RISING</p><p>Loch Ness</p><p>August 1968</p><p>Brianna blinked, brushing back a bright web of hair caught by the wind. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten what the sun looks like,\u201d she said, squinting at the object in question, shining with unaccustomed ferocity on the dark waters of Loch Ness.</p> <p>Her mother stretched luxuriously, enjoying the light wind. \u201cTo say nothing of what fresh air is like. I feel like a toadstool that\u2019s been growing in the dark for weeks\u2014all pale and squashy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine scholars the two of you would make,\u201d Roger said, but grinned. All three of them were in high spirits. After the arduous slog through the prison records to narrow the search to Ardsmuir, they had had a run of luck. The records for Ardsmuir were complete, in one spot, and\u2014in comparison to most others\u2014remarkably clear. Ardsmuir had been a prison for only fifteen years; following its renovation by Jacobite prison-labor, it had been converted into a small permanent garrison, and the prison population dispersed\u2014mostly transported to the American Colonies.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t imagine why Fraser wasn\u2019t sent along to America with the rest,\u201d Roger said. He had had a moment\u2019s panic there, going over and over the list of transported convicts from Ardsmuir, searching the names one by one, nearly letter by letter, and still finding no Frasers. He had been certain that Jamie Fraser had died in prison, and had been in a cold sweat of fear over the thought of telling the Randall women\u2014until the flip of a page had showed him Fraser\u2019s parole to a place named Helwater.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Claire said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a bloody good thing he wasn\u2019t. He\u2019s\u2014he was\u2014\u201d she caught herself quickly, but not quickly enough to stop Roger noticing the slip\u2014\u201cterribly, terribly seasick.\u201d She gestured at the surface of the loch before them, dancing with tiny waves. \u201cEven going out on something like that would turn him green in minutes.\u201d</p><p>Roger glanced at Brianna with interest. \u201cAre you seasick?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, bright hair lifting in the wind. \u201cNah.\u201d She patted her bare midriff smugly. \u201cCast-iron.\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed. \u201cWant to go out, then? It\u2019s your holiday, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Could we? Can you fish in there?\u201d Brianna shaded her eyes, looking eagerly out over the dark water.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. I\u2019ve caught salmon and eels many a time in Loch Ness,\u201d Roger assured her. \u201cCome along; we\u2019ll rent a wee boat at the dock in Drumnadrochit.\u201d</p><p>The drive to Drumnadrochit was a delight. The day was one of those clear, bright summer days that cause tourists from the South to stampede into Scotland in droves during August and September. With one of Fiona\u2019s larger breakfasts inside him, one of her lunches stowed in a basket in the boot, and Brianna Randall, long hair blowing in the wind, seated beside him, Roger was strongly disposed to consider that all was right with the world.</p><p>He allowed himself to dwell with satisfaction on the results of their researches. It had meant taking additional leave from his college for the summer term, but it had been worth it.</p><p>After finding the record of James Fraser\u2019s parole, it had taken another two weeks of slog and inquiry\u2014even a quick weekend trip by Roger and Bree to the Lake District, another by all three of them to London\u2014and then the sight that had made Brianna whoop out loud in the middle of the British Museum\u2019s sacrosanct Reading Room, causing their hasty departure amid waves of icy disapproval. The sight of the Royal Warrant of Pardon, stamped with the seal of George III, Rex Angleterre, dated 1764, bearing the name of \u201cJames Alexdrl M\u2019Kensie Frazier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting close,\u201d Roger had said, gloating over the photocopy of the Warrant of Pardon. \u201cBloody close!\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose?\u201d Brianna had said, but then had been distracted by the sight of their bus approaching, and had not pursued the matter. Roger had caught Claire\u2019s eye on him, though; she knew very well what he meant.</p><p>She would, of course, have been thinking of it; he wondered whether Brianna had. Claire had disappeared into the past in 1945, vanishing through the circle of standing stones on Craigh na Dun and reappearing in 1743. She had lived with Jamie Fraser for nearly three years, then returned through the stones. And she had come back nearly three years past the time of her original disappearance, in April of 1948.</p><p>All of which meant\u2014just possibly\u2014that if she were disposed to try the trip back through the stones once more, she would likely arrive twenty years past the time she had left\u2014in 1766. And 1766 was only two years past the latest known date at which Jamie Fraser had been located, alive and well. If he had survived another two years, and if Roger could find him...</p><p>\u201cThere it is!\u201d Brianna said suddenly. \u201c\u2018Boats for Rent.\u2019\u201d She pointed at the sign in the window of the dockside pub, and Roger nosed the car into a parking slot outside, with no further thought of Jamie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cI wonder why short men are so often enamored of very tall women?\u201d Claire\u2019s voice behind him echoed Roger\u2019s thoughts with an uncanny accuracy\u2014and not for the first time.</p><p>\u201cMoth and flame syndrome, perhaps?\u201d Roger suggested, frowning at the diminutive barman\u2019s evident fascination with Brianna. He and Claire were standing before the counter for rentals, waiting for the clerk to write up the receipt while Brianna bought bottles of Coca-Cola and brown ale to augment their lunch.</p><p>The young barman, who came up approximately to Brianna\u2019s armpit, was hopping to and fro, offering pickled eggs and slices of smoked tongue, eyes worshipfully upturned to the yellow-haltered goddess before him. From her laughter, Brianna appeared to think the man \u201ccute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always told Bree not to get involved with short men,\u201d Claire observed, watching this.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cSomehow I didn\u2019t envision you being all that much in the motherly advice line.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, disregarding his momentary sourness. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not, all that much. When you notice an important principle like that, though, it seems one\u2019s motherly duty to pass it along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong with short men, is there?\u201d Roger inquired.</p><p>\u201cThey tend to turn mean if they don\u2019t get their way,\u201d Claire answered. \u201cLike small yapping dogs. Cute and fluffy, but cross them and you\u2019re likely to get a nasty nip in the ankle.\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed. \u201cThis observation is the result of years of experience, I take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She nodded, glancing up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never met an orchestra conductor over five feet tall. Vicious specimens, practically all of them. But tall men\u201d\u2014her lips curved slightly as she surveyed his six-feet-three-inch frame\u2014\u201ctall men are almost always very sweet and gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet, eh?\u201d said Roger, with a cynical glance at the barman, who was cutting up a jellied eel for Brianna. Her face expressed a wary distaste, but she leaned forward, wrinkling her nose as she took the bite offered on a fork.</p><p>\u201cWith women,\u201d Claire amplified. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought it\u2019s because they realize that they don\u2019t have anything to prove; when it\u2019s perfectly obvious that they can do anything they like whether you want them to or not, they don\u2019t need to try to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile a short man\u2014\u201d Roger prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhile a short one knows he can\u2019t do anything unless you let him, and the knowledge drives him mad, so he\u2019s always trying something on, just to prove he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Roger made a Scottish noise in the back of his throat, meant to convey both appreciation of Claire\u2019s acuity, and general suspicion of what the barman might be wanting to prove to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said to the clerk, who shoved the receipt across the counter to him. \u201cReady, Bree?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The loch was calm and the fishing slow, but it was pleasant on the water, with the August sun warm on their backs and the scent of raspberry canes and sun-warmed pine trees wafting from the nearby shore. Full of lunch, they all grew drowsy, and before long, Brianna was curled up in the bow, asleep with her head pillowed on Roger\u2019s jacket. Claire sat in the stern, blinking, but still awake.</p><p>\u201cWhat about short and tall women?\u201d Roger asked, resuming their earlier conversation as he sculled slowly across the loch. He glanced over his shoulder at the amazing length of Brianna\u2019s legs, awkwardly curled under her. \u201cSame thing? The little ones nasty?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Claire shook her head meditatively, the curls beginning to work their way loose from her hairclip. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with size. I think it\u2019s more a matter of whether they see men as The Enemy, or just see them as men, and on the whole, rather like them for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, to do with women\u2019s liberation, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Claire said. \u201cI saw just the same kinds of behavior between men and women in 1743 that you see now. Some differences, of course, in how they each behave, but not so much in how they behave to each other.\u201d</p><p>She looked out over the dark waters of the loch, shading her eyes with her hand. She might have been keeping an eye out for otters and floating logs, but Roger thought that far-seeing gaze was looking a bit farther than the cliffs of the opposite shore.</p> <p>\u201cYou like men, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTall men.\u201d</p><p>She smiled briefly, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cWill you go, then\u2014if I can find him?\u201d he rested his oars momentarily, watching her.</p><p>She drew a deep breath before answering. The wind flushed her cheeks with pink and molded the fabric of the white shirt to her figure, showing off a high bosom and a slender waist. Too young to be a widow, he thought, too lovely to be wasted.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, a little shakily. \u201cThe thought of it\u2014or rather, the thoughts of it! On the one hand, to find Jamie\u2014and then, on the other, to...go through again.\u201d A shudder went through her, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable, you know,\u201d she said, eyes still closed as though she saw inside them the ring of stones on Craigh na Dun. \u201cHorrible, but horrible in a way that isn\u2019t like other horrible things, so you can\u2019t say.\u201d She opened her eyes and smiled wryly at him.</p><p>\u201cA bit like trying to tell a man what having a baby is like; he can more or less grasp the idea that it\u2019s painful, but he isn\u2019t equipped actually to understand what it feels like.\u201d</p><p>Roger grunted with amusement. \u201cOh, aye? Well, there\u2019s some difference, you know. I\u2019ve actually heard those bloody stones.\u201d He shivered himself, involuntarily. The memory of the night, three months ago, when Gillian Edgars had gone through the stones, was not one he willingly called to mind; it had come back to him in nightmares several times, though. He heaved strongly on the oars, trying to erase it.</p><p>\u201cLike being torn apart, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said, his eyes intent on hers. \u201cThere\u2019s something pulling at you, ripping, dragging, and not just outside\u2014inside you as well, so you feel your skull will fly to pieces any moment. And the filthy noise.\u201d He shuddered again. Claire\u2019s face had gone slightly pale.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could hear them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem important.\u201d He studied her a moment, as he pulled, then added quietly, \u201cBree heard them as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She turned to look back over the loch, where the wake of the tiny boat spread its V-shaped wings. Far behind, the waves from the passage of a larger boat reflected back from the cliffs and joined again in the center of the loch, making a long, humped form of glistening water\u2014a standing wave, a phenomenon of the loch that had often been mistaken for a sighting of the monster.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there, you know,\u201d she said suddenly, nodding down into the black, peat-laden water.</p><p>He opened his mouth to ask what she meant, but then realized that he did know. He had lived near Loch Ness for most of his life, fished for eels and salmon in its waters, and heard\u2014and laughed at\u2014every story of the \u201cfearsome beastie\u201d that had ever been told in the pubs of Drumnadrochit and Fort Augustus.</p><p>Perhaps it was the unlikeliness of the situation\u2014sitting here, calmly discussing whether the woman with him should or should not take the unimaginable risk of catapulting herself into an unknown past. Whatever the cause of his certainty, it seemed suddenly not only possible, but sure, that the dark water of the loch hid unknown but fleshly mystery.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d he asked, as much to give his disturbed feelings time to settle, as out of curiosity.</p><p>Claire leaned over the side, watching intently as a log drifted into view.</p><p>\u201cThe one I saw was probably a plesiosaur,\u201d she said at last. She didn\u2019t look at Roger, but kept her gaze astern. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t take notes at the time.\u201d Her mouth twisted in something not quite a smile.</p> <p>\u201cHow many stone circles are there?\u201d she asked abruptly. \u201cIn Britain, in Europe. Do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Several hundred, though,\u201d he answered cautiously. \u201cDo you think they\u2019re all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d she interrupted impatiently. \u201cThe point is, they may be. They were set up to mark something, which means there may be the hell of a lot of places where that something has happened.\u201d She tilted her head to one side, wiping the windblown hair out of her face, and gave him a lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cThat would explain it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d Roger felt fogged by the rapid shifts of her conversation.</p><p>\u201cThe monster.\u201d She gestured out over the water. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s another of those\u2014places\u2014under the loch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA time corridor\u2014passage\u2014whatever?\u201d Roger looked out over the purling wake, staggered by the idea.</p><p>\u201cIt would explain a lot.\u201d There was a smile hiding at the corner of her mouth, behind the veil of blowing hair. He couldn\u2019t tell whether she was serious or not. \u201cThe best candidates for monster are all things that have been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years. If there\u2019s a time passage under the loch, that would take care of that little problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would also explain why the reports are sometimes different,\u201d Roger said, becoming intrigued by the idea. \u201cIf it\u2019s different creatures who come through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it would explain why the creature\u2014or creatures\u2014haven\u2019t been caught, and aren\u2019t seen all that often. Maybe they go back the other way, too, so they aren\u2019t in the loch all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a marvelous idea!\u201d Roger said. He and Claire grinned at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet that isn\u2019t going to make it on the list of popular theories.\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed, catching a crab, and droplets of water sprayed over Brianna. She snorted, sat up abruptly, blinking, then sank back down, face flushed with sleep, and was breathing heavily within seconds.</p><p>\u201cShe was up late last night, helping me box up the last set of records to go back to the University of Leeds,\u201d Roger said, defensive on her behalf.</p><p>Claire nodded abstractedly, watching her daughter.</p><p>\u201cJamie could do that,\u201d she said softly. \u201cLie down and sleep anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She fell silent. Roger rowed steadily on, toward the point of the loch where the grim bulk of the ruins of Castle Urquhart stood amid its pines.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Claire said at last, \u201cit gets harder. Going through the first time was the most terrible thing I\u2019d ever had happen to me. Coming back was a thousand times worse.\u201d Her eyes were fixed on the looming castle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was because I didn\u2019t come back on the right day\u2014it was Beltane when I went, and two weeks before, when I came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeilie\u2014Gillian, I mean\u2014she went on Beltane, too.\u201d In spite of the heat of the day, Roger felt slightly cold, seeing again the figure of the woman who had been both his ancestor and his contemporary, standing in the light of a blazing bonfire, fixed for a moment in the light, before disappearing forever into the cleft of the standing stones.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what her notebook said\u2014that the door is open on the Sun Feasts and the Fire Feasts. Perhaps it\u2019s only partly open as you near those times. Or perhaps she was wrong altogether; after all, she thought you had to have a human sacrifice to make it work.\u201d</p><p>Claire swallowed heavily. The petrol-soaked remains of Greg Edgars, Gillian\u2019s husband, had been recovered from the stone circle by the police, on May Day. The record concluded of his wife only, \u201cFled, whereabouts unknown.\u201d</p><p>Claire leaned over the side, trailing a hand in the water. A small cloud drifted over the sun, turning the loch a sudden gray, with dozens of small waves rising on the surface as the light wind increased. Directly below, in the wake of the boat, the water was darkly impenetrable. Seven hundred feet deep is Loch Ness, and bitter cold. What can live in a place like that?</p><p>\u201cWould you go down there, Roger?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cJump overboard, dive in, go on down through that dark until your lungs were bursting, not knowing whether there are things with teeth and great heavy bodies waiting?\u201d</p><p>Roger felt the hair on his arms rise, and not only because the sudden wind was chilly.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not all the question,\u201d she continued, still staring into the blank, mysterious water. \u201cWould you go, if Brianna were down there?\u201d She straightened up and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cWould you go?\u201d The amber eyes were intent on his, unblinking as a hawk\u2019s.</p><p>He licked his lips, chapped and dried by the wind, and cast a quick look over his shoulder at Brianna, sleeping. He turned back to face Claire.</p><p>\u201cYes. I think I would.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a long moment, and then nodded, unsmiling.</p><p>\u201cSo would I.\u201d</p><p>PART FIVE</p><p>You Can\u2019t Go Home Again</p><p>18</p><p>ROOTS</p><p>September 1968</p><p>The woman next to me probably weighed three hundred pounds. She wheezed in her sleep, lungs laboring to lift the burden of her massive bosom for the two-hundred-thousandth time. Her hip and thigh and pudgy arm pressed against mine, unpleasantly warm and damp.</p><p>There was no escape; I was pinned on the other side by the steel curve of the plane\u2019s fuselage. I eased one arm upward and flicked on the overhead light in order to see my watch. Ten-thirty, by London time; at least another six hours before the landing in New York promised escape.</p><p>The plane was filled with the collective sighs and snorts of passengers dozing as best they might. Sleep for me was out of the question. With a sigh of resignation, I dug into the pocket in front of me for the half-finished romance novel I had stashed there. The tale was by one of my favorite authors, but I found my attention slipping from the book\u2014either back to Roger and Brianna, whom I had left in Edinburgh, there to continue the hunt, or forward, to what awaited me in Boston.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure just what did await me, which was part of the problem. I had been obliged to come back, if only temporarily; I had long since exhausted my vacation, plus several extensions. There were matters to be dealt with at the hospital, bills to be collected and paid at home, the maintenance of the house and yard to be attended to\u2014I shuddered to think what heights the lawn in the backyard must have attained by now\u2014friends to be called on...</p><p>One friend in particular. Joseph Abernathy had been my closest friend, from medical school on. Before I made any final\u2014and likely irrevocable\u2014decisions, I wanted to talk to him. I closed the book in my lap and sat tracing the extravagant loops of the title with one finger, smiling a little. Among other things, I owed a taste for romance novels to Joe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had known Joe since the beginning of my medical training. He stood out among the other interns at Boston General, just as I did. I was the only woman among the budding doctors; Joe was the only black intern.</p><p>Our shared singularity gave us each a special awareness for the other; both of us sensed it clearly, though neither mentioned it. We worked together very well, but both of us were wary\u2014for good reason\u2014of exposing ourselves, and the tenuous bond between us, much too nebulous to be called friendship, remained unacknowledged until near the end of our internship.</p><p>I had done my first unassisted surgery that day\u2014an uncomplicated appendectomy, done on a teenaged boy in good health. It had gone well, and there was no reason to think there would be postoperative complications. Still, I felt an odd kind of possessiveness about the boy, and didn\u2019t want to go home until he was awake and out of Recovery, even though my shift had ended. I changed clothes and went to the doctors\u2019 lounge on the third floor to wait.</p><p>The lounge wasn\u2019t empty. Joseph Abernathy sat in one of the rump-sprung stuffed chairs, apparently absorbed in a copy of U.S. News &amp; World Report. He looked up as I entered, and nodded briefly to me before returning to his reading.</p> <p>The lounge was equipped with stacks of magazines\u2014salvaged from the waiting rooms\u2014and a number of tattered paperbacks, abandoned by departing patients. Seeking distraction, I thumbed past a six-month-old copy of Studies in Gastroenterology, a ragged copy of Time magazine, and a neat stack of Watchtower tracts. Finally picking up one of the books, I sat down with it.</p><p>It had no cover, but the title page read The Impetuous Pirate. \u201cA sensuous, compelling love story, boundless as the Spanish Main!\u201d said the line beneath the title. The Spanish Main, eh? If escape was what I wanted, I couldn\u2019t do much better, I thought, and opened the book at random. It fell open automatically to page 42.</p><p>Tipping up her nose scornfully, Tessa tossed her lush blond tresses back, oblivious to the fact that this caused her voluptuous br**sts to become even more prominent in the low-necked dress. Valdez\u2019s eyes widened at the sight, but he gave no outward sign of the effect such wanton beauty had on him.</p><p>\u201cI thought that we might become better acquainted, Se\u00f1orita,\u201d he suggested, in a low, sultry voice that made little shivers of anticipation run up and down Tessa\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI have no interest in becoming acquainted with a...a...filthy, despicable, underhanded pirate!\u201d she said.</p> <p>Valdez\u2019s teeth gleamed as he smiled at her, his hand stroking the handle of the dagger at his belt. He was impressed at her fearlessness; so bold, so impetuous...and so beautiful.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, but went on reading, fascinated.</p><p>With an air of imperious possession, Valdez swooped an arm about Tessa\u2019s waist.</p><p>\u201cYou forget, Se\u00f1orita,\u201d he murmured, the words tickling her sensitive earlobe, \u201cyou are a prize of war; and the Captain of a pirate ship has first choice of the booty!\u201d</p><p>Tessa struggled in his powerful arms as he bore her to the berth and tossed her lightly onto the jeweled coverlet. She struggled to catch her breath, watching in terror as he undressed, laying aside his azure-blue velvet coat and then the fine ruffled white linen shirt. His chest was magnificent, a smooth expanse of gleaming bronze. Her fingertips ached to touch it, even though her heart pounded deafeningly in her ears as he reached for the waistband of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cBut no,\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cIt is unfair of me to neglect you, Se\u00f1orita. Allow me.\u201d With an irresistible smile, he bent and gently cupped Tessa\u2019s br**sts in the heated palms of his calloused hands, enjoying the voluptuous weight of them through the thin silken fabric. With a small scream, Tessa shrank away from his probing touch, pressing back against the lace-embroidered feather pillow.</p> <p>\u201cYou resist? What a pity to spoil such fine clothing, Se\u00f1orita...\u201d He took a firm grasp on her jade-silk bodice and yanked, causing Tessa\u2019s fine white br**sts to leap out of their concealment like a pair of plump partridges taking wing.</p><p>I made a sound, causing Dr. Abernathy to look sharply over the top of his U.S. News &amp; World Report. Hastily rearranging my face into a semblance of dignified absorption, I turned the page.</p><p>Valdez\u2019s thick black curls swept her chest as he fastened his hot lips on Tessa\u2019s rose-pink ni**les, making waves of anguished desire wash through her being. Weakened by the unaccustomed feelings that his ardor aroused in her, she was unable to move as his hand stealthily sought the hem of her gown and his blazing touch traced tendrils of sensation up the length of her slender thigh.</p><p>\u201cAh, mi amor,\u201d he groaned. \u201cSo lovely, so pure. You drive me mad with desire, mi amor. I have wanted you since I first saw you, so proud and cold on the deck of your father\u2019s ship. But not so cold now, my dear, eh?\u201d</p><p>In fact, Valdez\u2019s kisses were wreaking havoc on Tessa\u2019s feelings. How, how could she be feeling such things for this man, who had cold-bloodedly sunk her father\u2019s ship, and murdered a hundred men with his own hands? She should be recoiling in horror, but instead she found herself gasping for breath, opening her mouth to receive his burning kisses, arching her body in involuntary abandon beneath the demanding pressure of his burgeoning manhood.</p><p>\u201cAh, mi amor,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI cannot wait. But...I do not wish to hurt you. Gently, mi amor, gently.\u201d</p><p>Tessa gasped as she felt the increasing pressure of his desire making its presence known between her legs.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said. \u201cOh, please! You can\u2019t! I don\u2019t want you to!\u201d</p> <p>[Fine time to start making protests, I thought.]</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, mi amor. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Gradually, little by little, she relaxed under the touch of his hypnotic caresses, feeling the warmth in her stomach grow and spread. His lips brushed her breast, and his hot breath, murmuring reassurances, took away all her resistance. As she relaxed, her thighs opened without her willing it. Moving with infinite slowness, his engorged shaft teased aside the membrane of her innocence...</p><p>I let out a whoop and lost my grasp on the book, which slid off my lap and fell on the floor with a plop near Dr. Abernathy\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I murmured, and bent to retrieve it, my face flaming. As I came up with The Impetuous Pirate in my sweaty grasp, though, I saw that far from preserving his usual austere mien, Dr. Abernathy was grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d he said. \u201cValdez just teased aside the membrane of her innocence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, breaking out into helpless giggling again. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t too far into it,\u201d he said, taking the book from my hand. His short, blunt fingers flicked the pages expertly. \u201cIt had to be that one, or maybe the one on page 73, where he laves her pink mounds with his hungry tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee for yourself.\u201d He thrust the book back into my hands, pointing to a spot halfway down the page.</p><p>Sure enough, \u201c...lifting aside the coverlet, he bent his coal-black head and laved her pink mounds with his hungry tongue. Tessa moaned and...\u201d I gave an unhinged shriek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve actually read this?\u201d I demanded, tearing my eyes away from Tessa and Valdez.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said, the grin widening. He had a gold tooth, far back on the right side. \u201cTwo or three times. It\u2019s not the best one, but it isn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best one? There are more like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s see...\u201d He rose and began digging through the pile of tattered paperbacks on the table. \u201cYou want to look for the ones with no covers,\u201d he explained. \u201cThose are the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you never read anything but Lancet and the Journal of the AMA,\u201dI said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, I spend thirty-six hours up to my elbows in people\u2019s guts, and I want to come up here and read \u2018Advances in Gallbladder Resection?\u2019 Hell, no\u2014I\u2019d rather sail the Spanish Main with Valdez.\u201d He eyed me with some interest, the grin still not quite gone. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you read anything but The New England Journal of Medicine, either, Lady Jane,\u201d he said. \u201cAppearances are deceiving, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cWhat\u2019s this \u2018Lady Jane\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Hoechstein started that one,\u201d he said, leaning back with his fingers linked around one knee. \u201cIt\u2019s the voice, that accent that sounds like you just drank tea with the Queen. That\u2019s what you\u2019ve got, keeps the guys from bein\u2019 worse than they are. See, you sound like Winston Churchill\u2014if Winston Churchill was a lady, that is\u2014and that scares them a little. You\u2019ve got somethin\u2019 else, though\u201d\u2014he viewed me thoughtfully, rocking back in his chair. \u201cYou have a way of talking like you expect to get your way, and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll know the reason why. Where\u2019d you learn that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the war,\u201d I said, smiling at his description.</p><p>His eyebrows went up. \u201cKorea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was a combat nurse during the Second World War; in France. I saw a lot of Head Matrons who could turn interns and orderlies to jelly with a glance.\u201d And later, I had had a good deal of practice, where that air of inviolate authority\u2014assumed though it might be\u2014had stood me in good stead against people with a great deal more power than the nursing staff and interns of Boston General Hospital.</p><p>He nodded, absorbed in my explanation. \u201cYeah, that makes sense. I used Walter Cronkite, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalter Cronkite?\u201d I goggled at him.</p><p>He grinned again, showing his gold tooth. \u201cYou can think of somebody better? Besides, I got to hear him for free on the radio or the TV every night. I used to entertain my mama\u2014she wanted me to be a preacher.\u201d He smiled, half ruefully. \u201cIf I talked like Walter Cronkite where we lived in those days, I wouldn\u2019t have lived to go to med school.\u201d</p><p>I was liking Joe Abernathy more by the second. \u201cI hope your mother wasn\u2019t disappointed that you became a doctor intstead of a preacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you the truth, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said, still grinning. \u201cWhen I told her, she stared at me for a minute, then heaved a big sigh and said, \u2018Well, at least you can get my rheumatism medicine for me cheap.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I laughed wryly. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that much enthusiasm when I told my husband I was going to be a doctor. He stared at me, and finally said if I was bored, why didn\u2019t I volunteer to write letters for the inmates of the nursing home.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s eyes were a soft golden brown, like toffee drops. There was a glint of humor in them as they fixed on me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, folks still think it\u2019s fine to say to your face that you can\u2019t be doing what you\u2019re doing. \u2018Why are you here, little lady, and not home minding your man and child?\u2019\u201d he mimicked.</p><p>He grinned wryly, and patted my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll give it up sooner or later. They mostly don\u2019t ask me to my face anymore why I ain\u2019t cleanin\u2019 the toilets, like God made me to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the nurse had come with word that my appendix was awake, and I had left, but the friendship begun on page 42 had flourished, and Joe Abernathy had become one of my best friends; possibly the only person close to me who truly understood what I did, and why.</p><p>I smiled a little, feeling the slickness of the embossing on the cover. Then I leaned forward and put the book back into the seat pocket. Perhaps I didn\u2019t want to escape just now.</p><p>Outside, a floor of moonlit cloud cut us off from the earth below. Up here, everything was silent, beautiful and serene, in marked contrast to the turmoil of life below.</p><p>I had the odd feeling of being suspended, motionless, cocooned in solitude, even the heavy breathing of the woman next to me only a part of the white noise that makes up silence, one with the tepid rush of the air-conditioning and the shuffle of the stewardesses\u2019 shoes along the carpet. At the same time, I knew we were rushing on inexorably through the air, propelled at hundreds of miles per hour to some end\u2014as for it being a safe one, we could only hope.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, in suspended animation. Back in Scotland, Roger and Bree were hunting Jamie. Ahead, in Boston, my job\u2014and Joe\u2014were waiting. And Jamie himself? I tried to push the thought away, determined not to think of him until the decision was made.</p><p>I felt a slight ruffling of my hair, and one lock brushed against my cheek, light as a lover\u2019s touch. But surely it was no more than the rush of air from the vent overhead, and my imagination that the stale smells of perfume and cigarettes were suddenly underlaid by the scents of wool and heather.</p><p>19</p><p>TO LAY A GHOST</p><p>Home at last, to the house on Furey Street, where I had lived with Frank and Brianna for nearly twenty years. The azaleas by the door were not quite dead, but their leaves hung in limp, shabby clusters, a thick layer of fallen leaves curling on the dry-baked bed underneath. It was a hot summer\u2014there wasn\u2019t any other kind in Boston\u2014and the August rains hadn\u2019t come, even though it was mid-September by now.</p> <p>I set my bags by the front door and went to turn on the hose. It had been lying in the sun; the green rubber snake was hot enough to burn my hand, and I shifted it uneasily from palm to palm until the rumble of water brought it suddenly alive and cooled it with a burst of spray.</p><p>I didn\u2019t like azaleas all that much to start with. I would have pulled them out long since, but I had been reluctant to alter any detail of the house after Frank\u2019s death, for Brianna\u2019s sake. Enough of a shock, I thought, to begin university and have your father die in one year, without more changes. I had been ignoring the house for a long time; I could go on doing so.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d I said crossly to the azaleas, as I turned off the hose. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy, because that\u2019s all you get. I want to go have a drink myself. And a bath,\u201d I added, seeing their mud-spattered leaves.</p><p>I sat on the edge of the big sunken tub in my dressing gown, watching the water thunder in, churning the bubble bath into clouds of perfumed sea-foam. Steam rose from the boiling surface; the water would be almost too hot.</p><p>I turned it off\u2014one quick, neat twist of the tap\u2014and sat for a moment, the house around me still save for the crackle of popping bath bubbles, faint as the sounds of a far-off battle. I realized perfectly well what I was doing. I had been doing it ever since I stepped aboard the Flying Scotsman in Inverness, and felt the thrum of the track come alive beneath my feet. I was testing myself.</p><p>I had been taking careful note of the machines\u2014all the contrivances of modern daily life\u2014and more important, of my own response to them. The train to Edinburgh, the plane to Boston, the taxicab from the airport, and all the dozens of tiny mechanical flourishes attending\u2014vending machines, street lights, the plane\u2019s mile-high lavatory, with its swirl of nasty blue-green disinfectant, whisking waste and germs away with the push of a button. Restaurants, with their tidy certificates from the Department of Health, guaranteeing at least a better than even chance of escaping food poisoning when eating therein. Inside my own house, the omnipresent buttons that supplied light and heat and water and cooked food.</p> <p>The question was\u2014did I care? I dipped a hand into the steaming bathwater and swirled it to and fro, watching the shadows of the vortex dancing in the marble depths. Could I live without all the \u201cconveniences,\u201d large and small, to which I was accustomed?</p><p>I had been asking myself that with each touch of a button, each rumble of a motor, and was quite sure that the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d Time didn\u2019t make all the difference, after all; I could walk across the city and find people who lived without many of these conveniences\u2014farther abroad and there were entire countries where people lived in reasonable content and complete ignorance of electricity.</p><p>For myself, I had never cared a lot. I had lived with my uncle Lamb, an eminent archaeologist, since my own parents\u2019 death when I was five. Consequently, I had grown up in conditions that could conservatively be called \u201cprimitive,\u201d as I accompanied him on all his field expeditions. Yes, hot baths and light bulbs were nice, but I had lived without them during several periods of my life\u2014during the war, for instance\u2014and never found the lack of them acute.</p><p>The water had cooled enough to be tolerable. I dropped the dressing gown on the floor and stepped in, feeling a pleasant shiver as the heat at my feet made my shoulders prickle in cool contrast.</p><p>I subsided into the tub and relaxed, stretching my legs. Eighteenth-century hip baths were barely more than large barrels; one normally bathed in segments, immersing the center of the body first, with the legs hanging outside, then stood up and rinsed the upper torso while soaking the feet. More frequently, one bathed from a pitcher and basin, with the aid of a cloth.</p><p>No, conveniences and comforts were merely that. Nothing essential, nothing I couldn\u2019t do without.</p><p>Not that conveniences were the only issue, by a long chalk. The past was a dangerous country. But even the advances of so-called civilization were no guarantee of safety. I had lived through two major \u201cmodern\u201d wars\u2014actually served on the battlefields of one of them\u2014and could see another taking shape on the telly every evening.</p><p>\u201cCivilized\u201d warfare was, if anything, more horrifying than its older versions. Daily life might be safer, but only if one chose one\u2019s walk in it with care. Parts of Roxbury now were as dangerous as any alley I had walked in the Paris of two hundred years past.</p> <p>I sighed and pulled up the plug with my toes. No use speculating about impersonal things like bathtubs, bombs, and ra**sts. Indoor plumbing was no more than a minor distraction. The real issue was the people involved, and always had been. Me, and Brianna, and Jamie.</p><p>The last of the water gurgled away. I stood up, feeling slightly light-headed, and wiped away the last of the bubbles. The big mirror was misted with steam, but clear enough to show me myself from the knees upward, pink as a boiled shrimp.</p><p>Dropping the towel, I looked myself over. Flexed my arms, raised them overhead, checking for bagginess. None; biceps and triceps all nicely defined, deltoids neatly rounded and sloping into the high curve of the pectoralis major. I turned slightly to one side, tensing and relaxing my abdominals\u2014obliques in decent tone, the rectus abdominis flattening almost to concavity.</p><p>\u201cGood thing the family doesn\u2019t run to fat,\u201d I murmured. Uncle Lamb had remained trim and taut to the day of his death at seventy-five. I supposed my father\u2014Uncle Lamb\u2019s brother\u2014had been constructed similarly, and wondered suddenly what my mother\u2019s backside had looked like. Women, after all, had a certain amount of excess adipose tissue to contend with.</p><p>I turned all the way round and peered back over my shoulder at the mirror. The long columnar muscles of my back gleamed wetly as I twisted; I still had a waist, and a good narrow one, too.</p><p>As for my own backside\u2014\u201cWell, no dimples, anyway,\u201d I said aloud. I turned around and stared at my reflection.</p><p>\u201cIt could be a lot worse,\u201d I said to it.</p><p>Feeling somewhat heartened, I put on my nightgown and went about the business of putting the house to bed. No cats to put out, no dogs to feed\u2014Bozo, the last of our dogs, had died of old age the year before, and I had not wanted to get another, with Brianna off at school and my own hours at the hospital long and irregular.</p><p>Adjust the thermostat, check the locks of windows and doors, see that the burners of the stove were off. That was all there was to it. For eighteen years, the nightly route had included a stop in Brianna\u2019s room, but not since she had left for university.</p><p>Moved by a mixture of habit and compulsion, I pushed open the door to her room and clicked on the light. Some people have the knack of objects, and others haven\u2019t. Bree had it; scarcely an inch of wall space showed between the posters, photographs, dried flowers, scraps of tie-dyed fabric, framed certificates and other impedimenta on the walls.</p><p>Some people have a way of arranging everything about them, so the objects take on not only their own meaning, and a relation to the other things displayed with them, but something more besides\u2014an indefinable aura that belongs as much to their invisible owner as to the objects themselves. I am here because Brianna placed me here, the things in the room seemed to say. I am here because she is who she is.</p><p>It was odd that she should have that, really, I thought. Frank had had it; when I had gone to empty his university office after his death, I had thought it like the fossilized cast of some extinct animal; books and papers and bits of rubbish holding exactly the shape and texture and vanished weight of the mind that had inhabited the space.</p><p>For some of Brianna\u2019s objects, the relation to her was obvious\u2014pictures of me, of Frank, of Bozo, of friends. The scraps of fabric were ones she had made, her chosen patterns, the colors she liked\u2014a brilliant turquoise, deep indigo, magenta, and clear yellow. But other things\u2014why should the scatter of dried freshwater snail shells on the bureau say to me \u201cBrianna\u201d? Why that one lump of rounded pumice, taken from the beach at Truro, indistinguishable from a hundred thousand others\u2014except for the fact that she had taken it?</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a way with objects. I had no impulse either to acquire or to decorate\u2014Frank had often complained of the Spartan furnishings at home, until Brianna grew old enough to take a hand. Whether it was the fault of my nomadic upbringing, or only the way I was, I lived mostly inside my skin, with no impulse to alter my surroundings to reflect me.</p><p>Jamie was the same. He had had the few small objects, always carried in his sporran for utility or as talismans, and beyond that, had neither owned nor cared for things. Even during the short period when we had lived luxuriously in Paris, and the longer time of tranquillity at Lallybroch, he had never shown any disposition to acquire objects.</p><p>For him as well, it might have been the circumstances of his early manhood, when he had lived like a hunted animal, never owning anything beyond the weapons he depended on for survival. But perhaps it was natural to him also, this isolation from the world of things, this sense of self-sufficiency\u2014one of the things that had made us seek completion in each other.</p><p>Odd all the same, that Brianna should have so much resembled both her fathers, in their very different ways. I said a silent good night to the ghost of my absent daughter, and put out the light. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought of Frank went with me into the bedroom. The sight of the big double bed, smooth and untroubled under its dark blue satin spread, brought him suddenly and vividly to mind, in a way I had not thought of him in many months.</p><p>I supposed it was the possibility of impending departure that made me think of him now. This room\u2014this bed, in fact\u2014was where I had said goodbye to him for the last time.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you come to bed, Claire? It\u2019s past midnight.\u201d Frank looked up at me over the edge of his book. He was already in bed himself, reading with the book propped upon his knees. The soft pool of light from the lamp made him look as though he were floating in a warm bubble, serenely isolated from the dark chilliness of the rest of the room. It was early January, and despite the furnace\u2019s best efforts, the only truly warm place at night was bed, under heavy blankets.</p><p>I smiled at him, and rose from my chair, dropping the heavy wool dressing gown from my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cAm I keeping you up? Sorry. Just reliving this morning\u2019s surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI can tell by looking at you. Your eyes glaze over and your mouth hangs open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said again, matching his tone. \u201cI can\u2019t be responsible for what my face is doing when I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what good does thinking do?\u201d he asked, sticking a bookmark in his book. \u201cYou\u2019ve done whatever you could\u2014worrying about it now won\u2019t change...ah, well.\u201d He shrugged irritably and closed the book. \u201cI\u2019ve said it all before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d I said shortly.</p> <p>I got into bed, shivering slightly, and tucked my gown down round my legs. Frank scooted automatically in my direction, and I slid down under the sheets beside him, huddling together to pool our warmth against the cold.</p><p>\u201cOh, wait; I\u2019ve got to move the phone.\u201d I flung back the covers and scrambled out again, to move the phone from Frank\u2019s side of the bed to mine. He liked to sit in bed in the early evening, chatting with students and colleagues while I read or made surgical notes beside him, but he resented being wakened by the late calls that came from the hospital for me. Resented it enough that I had arranged for the hospital to call only for absolute emergencies, or when I left instructions to keep me informed of a specific patient\u2019s progress. Tonight I had left instructions; it was a tricky bowel resection. If things went wrong, I might have to go back in in a hurry.</p><p>Frank grunted as I turned out the light and slipped into bed again, but after a moment, he rolled toward me, throwing an arm across my middle. I rolled onto my side and curled against him, gradually relaxing as my chilled toes thawed.</p><p>I mentally replayed the details of the operation, feeling again the chill at my feet from the refrigeration in the operating room and the initial, unsettling feeling of the warmth in the patient\u2019s belly as my gloved fingers slid inside. The diseased bowel itself, coiled like a viper, patterned with the purple splotches of ecchymosis and the slow leakage of bright blood from tiny ruptures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been thinking.\u201d Frank\u2019s voice came out of the darkness behind me, excessively casual.</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d I was still absorbed in the vision of the surgery, but struggled to pull myself back to the present. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy sabbatical.\u201d His leave from the university was due to start in a month. He had planned to make a series of short trips through the northeastern United States, gathering material, then go to England for six months, returning to Boston to spend the last three months of the sabbatical writing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought of going to England straight off,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cWell, why not? The weather will be dreadful, but if you\u2019re going to spend most of the time in libraries...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to take Brianna with me.\u201d</p><p>I stopped dead, the cold in the room suddenly coalescing into a small lump of suspicion in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t go now; she\u2019s only a semester from graduation. Surely you can wait until we can join you in the summer? I\u2019ve put in for a long vacation then, and perhaps...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going now. For good. Without you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away and sat up, turning on the light. Frank lay blinking up at me, dark hair disheveled. It had gone gray at the temples, giving him a distinguished air that seemed to have alarming effects on the more susceptible of his female students. I felt quite astonishingly composed.</p> <p>\u201cWhy now, all of a sudden? The latest one putting pressure on you, is she?\u201d</p><p>The look of alarm that flashed into his eyes was so pronounced as to be comical. I laughed, with a noticeable lack of humor.</p><p>\u201cYou actually thought I didn\u2019t know? God, Frank! You are the most...oblivious man!\u201d</p><p>He sat up in bed, jaw tight.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had been most discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have been at that,\u201d I said sardonically. \u201cI counted six over the last ten years\u2014if there were really a dozen or so, then you were quite the model of discretion.\u201d</p><p>His face seldom showed great emotion, but a whitening beside his mouth told me that he was very angry indeed.</p><p>\u201cThis one must be something special,\u201d I said, folding my arms and leaning back against the headboard in assumed casualness. \u201cBut still\u2014why the rush to go to England now, and why take Bree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can go to boarding school for her last term,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cBe a new experience for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one I expect she wants,\u201d I said. \u201cShe won\u2019t want to leave her friends, especially not just before graduation. And certainly not to go to an English boarding school!\u201d I shuddered at the thought. I had come within inches of being immured in just such a school as a child; the scent of the hospital cafeteria sometimes evoked memories of it, complete with the waves of terrified helplessness I had felt when Uncle Lamb had taken me to visit the place.</p><p>\u201cA little discipline never hurt anyone,\u201d Frank said. He had recovered his temper, but the lines of his face were still tight. \u201cMight have done you some good.\u201d He waved a hand, dismissing the topic. \u201cLet that be. Still, I\u2019ve decided to go back to England permanently. I\u2019ve a good position offered at Cambridge, and I mean to take it up. You won\u2019t leave the hospital, of course. But I don\u2019t mean to leave my daughter behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter?\u201d I felt momentarily incapable of speech. So he had a new job all set, and a new mistress to go along. He\u2019d been planning this for some time, then. A whole new life\u2014but not with Brianna.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cYou can come to visit whenever you like, of course...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...bloody...bastard!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDo be reasonable, Claire.\u201d He looked down his nose, giving me Treatment A, long-suffering patience, reserved for students appealing failing grades. \u201cYou\u2019re scarcely ever home. If I\u2019m gone, there will be no one to look after Bree properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk as though she\u2019s eight, not almost eighteen! For heaven\u2019s sake, she\u2019s nearly grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason she needs care and supervision,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIf you\u2019d seen what I\u2019d seen at the university\u2014the drinking, the drugging, the...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do see it,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cAt fairly close range in the emergency room. Bree is not likely to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe damn well is! Girls have no sense at that age\u2014she\u2019ll be off with the first fellow who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be idiotic! Bree\u2019s very sensible. Besides, all young people experiment, that\u2019s how they learn. You can\u2019t keep her swaddled in cotton wool all her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter swaddled than f**king a black man!\u201d he shot back. A mottled red showed faintly over his cheekbones. \u201cLike mother, like daughter, eh? But that\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to be, damn it, not if I\u2019ve anything to say about it!\u201d</p><p>I heaved out of bed and stood up, glaring down at him.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said, \u201chave not got one bloody, filthy, stinking thing to say, about Bree or anything else!\u201d I was trembling with rage, and had to press my fists into the sides of my legs to keep from striking him. \u201cYou have the absolute, unmitigated gall to tell me that you are leaving me to live with the latest of a succession of mistresses, and then imply that I have been having an affair with Joe Abernathy? That is what you mean, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He had the grace to lower his eyes slightly.</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks you have,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou spend all your time with the man. It\u2019s the same thing, so far as Bree is concerned. Dragging her into...situations, where she\u2019s exposed to danger, and...and to those sorts of people...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack people, I suppose you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI damn well do,\u201d he said, looking up at me with eyes flashing. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough to have the Abernathys to parties all the time, though at least he\u2019s educated. But that obese person I met at their house with the tribal tattoos and the mud in his hair? That repulsive lounge lizard with the oily voice? And young Abernathy\u2019s taken to hanging round Bree day and night, taking her to marches and rallies and orgies in low dives...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think there are any high dives,\u201d I said, repressing an inappropriate urge to laugh at Frank\u2019s unkind but accurate assessment of two of Leonard Abernathy\u2019s more outr\u00e9 friends. \u201cDid you know Lenny\u2019s taken to calling himself Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he told me,\u201d he said shortly, \u201cand I am taking no risk of having my daughter become Mrs. Shabazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Bree feels that way about Lenny,\u201d I assured him, struggling to suppress my irritation.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t going to, either. She\u2019s going to England with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if she doesn\u2019t want to,\u201d I said, with great finality.</p><p>No doubt feeling that his position put him at a disadvantage, Frank climbed out of bed and began groping for his slippers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to take my daughter to England,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Bree\u2019s still a minor; she\u2019ll go where I say. I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d find her medical records; the new school will need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter?\u201d I said again. I vaguely noticed the chill in the room, but was so angry that I felt hot all over. \u201cBree\u2019s my daughter, and you\u2019ll take her bloody nowhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me,\u201d he pointed out, with aggravating calmness, picking up his dressing gown from the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want to divorce me? Fine. Use any grounds you like\u2014with the exception of adultery, which you can\u2019t prove, because it doesn\u2019t exist. But if you try to take Bree away with you, I\u2019ll have a thing or two to say about adultery. Do you want to know how many of your discarded mistresses have come to see me, to ask me to give you up?\u201d</p><p>His mouth hung open in shock.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told them all that I\u2019d give you up in a minute,\u201d I said, \u201cif you asked.\u201d I folded my arms, tucking my hands into my armpits. I was beginning to feel the chilliness again. \u201cI did wonder why you never asked\u2014but I supposed it was because of Brianna.\u201d</p><p>His face had gone quite bloodless now, and showed white as a skull in the dimness on the other side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, with a poor attempt at his usual self-possession, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought you minded. It\u2019s not as though you ever made a move to stop me.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, completely taken aback.</p> <p>\u201cStop you?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat should I have done? Steamed open your mail and waved the letters under your nose? Made a scene at the faculty Christmas party? Complained to the Dean?\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed tight together for a moment, then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYou might have behaved as though it mattered to you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt mattered.\u201d My voice sounded strangled.</p><p>He shook his head, still staring at me, his eyes dark in the lamplight.</p> <p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d He paused, face floating pale in the air above his dark dressing gown, then came round the bed to stand by me.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I wondered if I could rightfully blame you,\u201d he said, almost thoughtfully. \u201cHe looked like Bree, didn\u2019t he? He was like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He breathed heavily, almost a snort.</p><p>\u201cI could see it in your face\u2014when you\u2019d look at her, I could see you thinking of him. Damn you, Claire Beauchamp,\u201d he said, very softly. \u201cDamn you and your face that can\u2019t hide a thing you think or feel.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence after this, of the sort that makes you hear all the tiny unbearable noises of creaking wood and breathing houses\u2014only in an effort to pretend you haven\u2019t heard what was just said.</p> <p>\u201cI did love you,\u201d I said softly, at last. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d he echoed. \u201cShould I be grateful for that?\u201d</p><p>The feeling was beginning to come back to my numb lips.</p><p>\u201cI did tell you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then, when you wouldn\u2019t go...Frank, I did try.\u201d</p><p>Whatever he heard in my voice stopped him for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I said, very softly.</p><p>He turned away and moved toward my dressing table, where he touched things restlessly, picking them up and putting them down at random.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you at the first\u2014pregnant, alone. Only a cad would have done that. And then...Bree.\u201d He stared sightlessly at the lipstick he held in one hand, then set it gently back on the glassy tabletop. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give her up,\u201d he said softly. He turned to look at me, eyes dark holes in a shadowed face.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know I couldn\u2019t sire a child? I...had myself tested, a few years ago. I\u2019m sterile. Did you know?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, not trusting myself to speak.</p><p>\u201cBree is mine, my daughter,\u201d he said, as though to himself. \u201cThe only child I\u2019ll ever have. I couldn\u2019t give her up.\u201d He gave a short laugh. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give her up, but you couldn\u2019t see her without thinking of him, could you? Without that constant memory, I wonder\u2014would you have forgotten him, in time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The whispered word seemed to go through him like an electric shock. He stood frozen for a moment, then whirled to the closet and began to jerk on his clothes over his pajamas. I stood, arms wrapped around my body, watching as he pulled on his overcoat and stamped out of the room, not looking at me. The collar of his blue silk pajamas stuck up over the astrakhan trim of his coat.</p><p>A moment later, I heard the closing of the front door\u2014he had sufficient presence of mind not to slam it\u2014and then the sound of a cold motor turning reluctantly over. The headlights swept across the bedroom ceiling as the car backed down the drive, and then were gone, leaving me shaking by the rumpled bed.</p><p>Frank didn\u2019t come back. I tried to sleep, but found myself lying rigid in the cold bed, mentally reliving the argument, listening for the crunch of his tires in the drive. At last, I got up and dressed, left a note for Bree, and went out myself.</p><p>The hospital hadn\u2019t called, but I might as well go and have a look at my patient; it was better than tossing and turning all night. And, to be honest, I would not have minded had Frank come home to find me gone.</p><p>The streets were slick as butter, black ice gleaming in the streetlights. The yellow phosphor glow lit whorls of falling snow; within an hour, the ice that lined the streets would be concealed beneath fresh powder, and twice as perilous to travel. The only consolation was that there was no one on the streets at 4:00 A.M. to be imperiled. No one but me, that is.</p><p>Inside the hospital, the usual warm, stuffy institutional smell wrapped itself round me like a blanket of familiarity, shutting out the snow-filled black night outside.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d the nurse said to me softly, as though a raised voice might disturb the sleeping man. \u201cAll the vitals are stable, and the count\u2019s okay. No bleeding.\u201d I could see that it was true; the patient\u2019s face was pale, but with a faint undertone of pink, like the veining in a white rose petal, and the pulse in the hollow of his throat was strong and regular.</p><p>I let out the deep breath I hadn\u2019t realized I was holding. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d I said. \u201cVery good.\u201d The nurse smiled warmly at me, and I had to resist the impulse to lean against him and dissolve. The hospital surroundings suddenly seemed like my only refuge.</p><p>There was no point in going home. I checked briefly on my remaining patients, and went down to the cafeteria. It still smelled like a boarding school, but I sat down with a cup of coffee and sipped it slowly, wondering what I would tell Bree.</p><p>It might have been a half-hour later when one of the ER nurses hurried through the swinging doors and stopped dead at the sight of me. Then she came on, quite slowly.</p><p>I knew at once; I had seen doctors and nurses deliver the news of death too often to mistake the signs. Very calmly, feeling nothing whatever, I set down the almost full cup, realizing as I did so that for the rest of my life, I would remember that there was a chip in the rim, and that the \u201cB\u201d of the gold lettering on the side was almost worn away.</p><p>\u201c...said you were here. Identification in his wallet...police said...snow on black ice, a skid...DOA...\u201d the nurse was talking, babbling, as I strode through the bright white halls, not looking at her, seeing the faces of the nurses at the station turn toward me in slow motion, not knowing, but seeing from a glance at me that something final had happened.</p><p>He was on a gurney in one of the emergency room cubicles; a spare, anonymous space. There was an ambulance parked outside\u2014perhaps the one that had brought him here. The double doors at the end of the corridor were open to the icy dawn. The ambulance\u2019s red light was pulsing like an artery, bathing the corridor in blood.</p><p>I touched him briefly. His flesh had the inert, plastic feel of the recently dead, so at odds with the lifelike appearance. There was no wound visible; any damage was hidden beneath the blanket that covered him. His throat was smooth and brown; no pulse moved in its hollow.</p><p>I stood there, my hand on the motionless curve of his chest, looking at him, as I had not looked for some time. A strong and delicate profile, sensitive lips, and a chiseled nose and jaw. A handsome man, despite the lines that cut deep beside his mouth, lines of disappointment and unspoken anger, lines that even the relaxation of death could not wipe away.</p><p>I stood quite still, listening. I could hear the wail of a new ambulance approaching, voices in the corridor. The squeak of gurney wheels, the crackle of a police radio, and the soft hum of a fluorescent light somewhere. I realized with a start that I was listening for Frank, expecting...what? That his ghost would be hovering still nearby, anxious to complete our unfinished business?</p><p>I closed my eyes, to shut out the disturbing sight of that motionless profile, going red and white and red in turn as the light throbbed through the open doors.</p><p>\u201cFrank,\u201d I said softly, to the unsettled, icy air, \u201cif you\u2019re still close enough to hear me\u2014I did love you. Once. I did.\u201d</p><p>Then Joe was there, pushing through the crowded corridor, face anxious over his green scrub suit. He had come straight from surgery; there was a small spray of blood across the lenses of his glasses, a smear of it on his chest.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said, \u201cGod, Claire!\u201d and then I started to shake. In ten years, he had never called me anything but \u201cJane\u201d or \u201cL.J.\u201d If he was using my name, it must be real. My hand showed startlingly white in Joe\u2019s dark grasp, then red in the pulsing light, and then I had turned to him, solid as a tree trunk, rested my head on his shoulder, and\u2014for the first time\u2014wept for Frank.</p><p>I leaned my face against the bedroom window of the house on Furey Street. It was hot and humid on this blue September evening, filled with the sound of crickets and lawn sprinklers. What I saw, though, was the uncompromising black and white of that winter\u2019s night two years before\u2014black ice and the white of hospital linen, and then the blurring of all judgments in the pale gray dawn.</p><p>My eyes blurred now, remembering the anonymous bustle in the corridor and the pulsing red light of the ambulance that had washed the silent cubicle in bloody light, as I wept for Frank.</p><p>Now I wept for him for the last time, knowing even as the tears slid down my cheeks that we had parted, once and for all, twenty-odd years before, on the crest of a green Scottish hill.</p><p>My weeping done, I rose and laid a hand on the smooth blue coverlet, gently rounded over the pillow on the left\u2014Frank\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, my dear,\u201d I whispered, and went out to sleep downstairs, away from the ghosts.</p><p>It was the doorbell that woke me in the morning, from my makeshift bed on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cTelegram, ma\u2019ma,\u201d the messenger said, trying not to stare at my nightgown.</p><p>Those small yellow envelopes have probably been responsible for more heart attacks than anything besides fatty bacon for breakfast. My own heart squeezed like a fist, then went on beating in a heavy, uncomfortable manner.</p><p>I tipped the messenger and carried the telegram down the hall. It seemed important not to open it until I had reached the relative safety of the bathroom, as though it were an explosive device that must be defused under water.</p><p>My fingers shook and fumbled as I opened it, sitting on the edge of the tub, my back pressed against the tiled wall for reinforcement.</p><p>It was a brief message\u2014of course, a Scot would be thrifty with words, I thought absurdly.</p><p>HAVE FOUND HIM STOP, it read. WILL YOU COME BACK QUERY ROGER.</p><p>I folded the telegram neatly and put it back into its envelope. I sat there and stared at it for quite a long time. Then I stood up and went to dress.</p><p>20</p><p>DIAGNOSIS</p><p>Joe Abernathy was seated at his desk, frowning at a small rectangle of pale cardboard he held in both hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I said, sitting on the edge of his desk without ceremony.</p><p>\u201cA business card.\u201d He handed the card to me, looking at once amused and irritated.</p><p>It was a pale gray laid-finish card; expensive stock, fastidiously printed in an elegant serif type. Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz III, the center line read, with address and phone number below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLenny?\u201d I asked, laughing. \u201cMuhammad Ishmael Shabazz the third?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Amusement seemed to be getting the upper hand. The gold tooth flashed briefly as he took the card back. \u201cHe says he\u2019s not going to take a white man\u2019s name, no slave name. He\u2019s going to reclaim his African heritage,\u201d he said sardonically. \u201cAll right, I say; I ask him, you gonna go round with a bone through your nose next thing? It\u2019s not enough he\u2019s got his hair out to here\u201d\u2014he gestured, fluffing his hands on either side of his own close-cropped head\u2014\u201cand he\u2019s going round in a thing down to his knees, looks like his sister made it in Home Ec class. No, Lenny\u2014excuse me, Muhammad\u2014he\u2019s got to be African all the way.\u201d</p><p>Joe waved a hand out the window, at his privileged vista over the park. \u201cI tell him, look around, man, you see any lions? This look like Africa to you?\u201d He leaned back in his padded chair, stretching out his legs. He shook his head in resignation. \u201cThere\u2019s no talkin\u2019 to a boy that age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what\u2019s this \u2018third\u2019 about?\u201d</p> <p>A reluctant gleam of gold answered me. \u201cWell, he was talking all about his \u2018lost tradition\u2019 and his \u2018missing history\u2019 and all. He says, \u2018How am I going to hold my head up, face-to-face with all these guys I meet at Yale named Cadwallader IV and Sewell Lodge, Jr., and I don\u2019t even know my own grandaddy\u2019s name, I don\u2019t know where I come from?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Joe snorted. \u201cI told him, you want to know where you come from, kid, look in the mirror. Wasn\u2019t the Mayflower, huh?\u201d</p><p>He picked up the card again, a reluctant grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cSo he says, if he\u2019s taking back his heritage, why not take it back all the way? If his grandaddy wouldn\u2019t give him a name, he\u2019ll give his grandaddy one. And the only trouble with that,\u201d he said, looking up at me under a cocked brow, \u201cis that it kind of leaves me man in the middle. Now I have to be Muhammad Ishmael Shabazz, Junior, so Lenny can be a \u2018proud African-American\u2019.\u201d He thrust himself back from the desk, chin on his chest, staring balefully at the pale gray card.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, L.J.,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least Bree isn\u2019t giving you grief about who her granddaddy was. All you have to worry about is will she be doing dope and getting pregnant by some draft dodger who takes off for Canada.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, with more than a touch of irony. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He cocked an interested eyebrow at me, then took off his gold-rimmed glasses and wiped them on the end of his tie. \u201cSo how was Scotland?\u201d he asked, eyeing me. \u201cBree like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still there,\u201d I said. \u201cLooking for her history.\u201d</p><p>Joe was opening his mouth to say something when a tentative knock on the door interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cDr. Abernathy?\u201d A plump young man in a polo shirt peered doubtfully into the office, leaning over the top of a large cardboard box he held clutched to his substantial abdomen.</p><p>\u201cCall me Ishmael,\u201d Joe said genially.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The young man\u2019s mouth hung slightly open, and he glanced at me in bewilderment, mingled with hope. \u201cAre you Dr. Abernathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201che is, when he puts his mind to it.\u201d I rose from the desk, brushing down my skirts. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your appointment, Joe, but if you have time later\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stay a minute, L. J.,\u201d he interrupted, rising. He took the box from the young man, then shook his hand formally. \u201cYou\u2019d be Mr. Thompson? John Wicklow called to tell me you\u2019d be coming. Pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorace Thompson, yes,\u201d the young man said, blinking slightly. \u201cI brought, er, a specimen...\u201d He waved vaguely at the cardboard box.</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019d be happy to look at it for you, but I think Dr. Randall here might be of assistance, too.\u201d He glanced at me, the glint of mischief in his eyes. \u201cI just want to see can you do it to a dead person, L. J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what to a dead\u2014\u201d I began, when he reached into the opened box and carefully lifted out a skull.</p><p>\u201cOh, pretty,\u201d he said in delight, turning the object gently to and fro.</p><p>\u201cPretty\u201d was not the first adjective that struck me; the skull was stained and greatly discolored, the bone gone a deep streaky brown. Joe carried it to the window and held it in the light, his thumbs gently stroking the small bony ridges over the eye sockets.</p> <p>\u201cPretty lady,\u201d he said softly, talking as much to the skull as to me or Horace Thompson. \u201cFull-grown, mature. Maybe late forties, middle fifties. Do you have the legs?\u201d he asked, turning abruptly to the plump young man.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right here,\u201d Horace Thompson assured him, reaching into the box. \u201cWe have the whole body, in fact.\u201d</p><p>Horace Thompson was probably someone from the coroner\u2019s office, I thought. Sometimes they brought bodies to Joe that had been found in the countryside, badly deteriorated, for an expert opinion as to the cause of death. This one looked considerably deteriorated.</p><p>\u201cHere, Dr. Randall.\u201d Joe leaned over and carefully placed the skull in my hands. \u201cTell me whether this lady was in good health, while I check her legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m not a forensic scientist.\u201d Still, I glanced automatically down. It was either an old specimen, or had been weathered extensively; the bone was smooth, with a gloss that fresh specimens never had, stained and discolored by the leaching of pigments from the earth.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d I turned the skull slowly in my hands, watching the bones, naming them each in my mind as I saw them. The smooth arch of the parietals, fused to the declivity of the temporal, with the small ridge where the jaw muscle originated, the jutting projection that meshed itself with the maxillary into the graceful curve of the squamosal arch. She had had lovely cheekbones, high and broad. The upper jaw had most of its teeth\u2014straight and white.</p><p>Deep eyes. The scooped bone at the back of the orbits was dark with shadow; even by tilting the skull to the side, I couldn\u2019t get light to illuminate the whole cavity. The skull felt light in my hands, the bone fragile. I stroked her brow and my hand ran upward, and down behind the occiput, my fingers seeking the dark hole at the base, the foremen magnum, where all the messages of the nervous system pass to and from the busy brain.</p><p>Then I held it close against my stomach, eyes closed, and felt the shifting sadness, filling the cavity of the skull like running water. And an odd faint sense\u2014of surprise?</p><p>\u201cSomeone killed her,\u201d I said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d I opened my eyes to find Horace Thompson staring at me, his own eyes wide in his round, pale face. I handed him the skull, very gingerly. \u201cWhere did you find her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Mr. Thompson exchanged glances with Joe, then looked back at me, both eyebrows still high.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from a cave in the Caribbean,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were a lot of artifacts with her. We think she\u2019s maybe between a hundred-fifty and two hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>Joe was grinning broadly, enjoying his joke.</p><p>\u201cOur friend Mr. Thompson here is from the anthropology department at Harvard,\u201d he said. \u201cHis friend Wicklow knows me; asked me would I have a look at this skeleton, to tell them what I could about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nerve of you!\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cI thought she was some unidentified body the coroner\u2019s office dragged in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s unidentified,\u201d Joe pointed out. \u201cAnd certainly liable to stay that way.\u201d He rooted about in the cardboard box like a terrier. The end flap said PICT-SWEET CORN.</p><p>\u201cNow what have we got here?\u201d he said, and very carefully drew out a plastic sack containing a jumble of vertebrae.</p><p>\u201cShe was in pieces when we got her,\u201d Horace explained.</p><p>\u201cOh, de headbone connected to de...neckbone,\u201d Joe sang softly, laying out the vertebrae along the edge of the desk. His stubby fingers darted skillfully among the bones, nudging them into alignment. \u201cDe neckbone connected to de...backbone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to him,\u201d I told Horace. \u201cYou\u2019ll just encourage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow hear...de word...of de Lawd!\u201d he finished triumphantly. \u201cJesus Christ, L. J., you\u2019re somethin\u2019 else! Look here.\u201d Horace Thompson and I bent obediently over the line of spiky vertebral bones. The wide body of the axis had a deep gouge; the posterior zygapophysis had broken clean off, and the fracture plane went completely through the centrum of the bone.</p><p>\u201cA broken neck?\u201d Thompson asked, peering interestedly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but more than that, I think.\u201d Joe\u2019s finger moved over the line of the fracture plane. \u201cSee here? The bone\u2019s not just cracked, it\u2019s gone right there. Somebody tried to cut this lady\u2019s head clean off. With a dull blade,\u201d he concluded with relish.</p><p>Horace Thompson was looking at me queerly. \u201cHow did you know she\u2019d been killed, Dr. Randall?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I could feel the blood rising in my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2014she\u2014felt like it, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He blinked a few times, but didn\u2019t press me further. \u201cHow odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does it all the time,\u201d Joe informed him, squinting at the femur he was measuring with a pair of calipers. \u201cMostly on live people, though. Best diagnostician I ever saw.\u201d He set down the calipers and picked up a small plastic ruler. \u201cA cave, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think it was a...er, secret slave burial,\u201d Mr. Thompson explained, blushing, and I suddenly realized why he had seemed so abashed when he realized which of us was the Dr. Abernathy he had been sent to see. Joe shot him a sudden sharp glance, but then bent back to his work. He kept humming \u201cDem Dry Bones\u201d faintly to himself as he measured the pelvic inlet, then went back to the legs, this time concentrating on the tibia. Finally he straightened up, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNot a slave,\u201d he said.</p><p>Horace blinked. \u201cBut she must have been,\u201d he said. \u201cThe things we found with her...a clear African influence...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Joe said flatly. He tapped the long femur, where it rested on his desk. His fingernail clicked on the dry bone. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell that? From bones?\u201d Horace Thompson was visibly agitated. \u201cBut I thought\u2014that paper by Jensen, I mean\u2014theories about racial physical differences\u2014largely exploded\u2014\u201d He blushed scarlet, unable to finish.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re there,\u201d said Joe, very dryly indeed. \u201cIf you want to think blacks and whites are equal under the skin, be my guest, but it ain\u2019t scientifically so.\u201d He turned and pulled a book from the shelf behind him. Tables of Skeletal Variance, the title read.</p><p>\u201cTake a look at this,\u201d Joe invited. \u201cYou can see the differences in a lot of bones, but especially in the leg bones. Blacks have a completely different femur-to-tibia ratio than whites do. And that lady\u201d\u2014he pointed to the skeleton on his desk\u2014\u201cwas white. Caucasian. No question about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Horace Thompson murmured. \u201cWell. I\u2019ll have to think\u2014I mean\u2014it was very kind of you to look at her for me. Er, thank you,\u201d he added, with an awkward little bow. We silently watched him bundle his bones back into the PICT-SWEET box, and then he was gone, pausing at the door to give us both another brief bob of the head.</p><p>Joe gave a short laugh as the door closed behind him. \u201cWant to bet he takes her down to Rutgers for a second opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcademics don\u2019t give up theories easily,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cI lived with one long enough to know that.\u201d</p><p>Joe snorted again. \u201cSo you did. Well, now that we\u2019ve got Mr. Thompson and his dead white lady sorted out, what can I do for you, L. J.?\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep breath and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cI need an honest opinion, from somebody I can depend on to be objective. No,\u201d I amended, \u201cI take that back. I need an opinion and then\u2014depending on the opinion\u2014maybe a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Joe assured me. \u201cEspecially the opinion. My specialty, opinions.\u201d He rocked back in his chair, unfolded his gold-rimmed glasses and set them firmly atop his broad nose. Then he folded his hands across his chest, fingers steepled, and nodded at me. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I sexually attractive?\u201d I demanded. His eyes always reminded me of coffee drops, with their warm golden-brown color. Now they went completely round, enhancing the resemblance.</p><p>Then they narrowed, but he didn\u2019t answer immediately. He looked me over carefully, head to toe.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trick question, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI give you an answer and one of those women\u2019s libbers jumps out from behind the door, yells \u2018Sexist pig!\u2019 And hits me over the head with a sign that says \u2018Castrate Male Chauvinists.\u2019 Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I assured him. \u201cA sexist male chauvinist answer is basically what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. As long as we\u2019re straight, then.\u201d He resumed his perusal, squinting closely as I stood up straight.</p><p>\u201cSkinny white broad with too much hair, but a great ass,\u201d he said at last. \u201cNice tits, too,\u201d he added, with a cordial nod. \u201cThat what you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, relaxing my rigid posture. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I wanted to know. It isn\u2019t the sort of question you can ask just anybody.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips in a silent whistle, then threw back his head and roared with delight.</p> <p>\u201cLady Jane! You\u2019ve got you a man!\u201d</p><p>I felt the blood rising in my cheeks, but tried to keep my dignity. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. Just maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, hell! Jesus Christ on a piece of toast, L. J., it\u2019s about time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKindly quit cackling,\u201d I said, lowering myself into his visitor\u2019s chair. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t become a man of your years and station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy years? Oho,\u201d he said, peering shrewdly at me through the glasses. \u201cHe\u2019s younger than you? That\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot,\u201d I said, the blush beginning to recede. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen him in twenty years. You\u2019re the only person I know who\u2019s known me for a long time; have I changed terribly since we met?\u201d I looked at him straight on, demanding honesty.</p><p>He looked at me, took off his glasses and squinted, then replaced them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t, though, unless you got fat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Ever been to your high school reunion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go to a high school.\u201d</p><p>His sketchy brows flicked upward. \u201cNo? Well, I have. And I tell you what, L.J.; you see all these people you haven\u2019t seen for twenty years, and there\u2019s this split second when you meet somebody you used to know, when you think, \u2018My God, he\u2019s changed!,\u2019 and then all of a sudden, he hasn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s just like the twenty years weren\u2019t there. I mean\u201d\u2014he rubbed his head vigorously, struggling for meaning\u2014\u201cyou see they\u2019ve got some gray, and some lines, and maybe they aren\u2019t just the same as they were, but two minutes past that shock, and you don\u2019t see it anymore. They\u2019re just the same people they always were, and you have to make yourself stand back a ways to see that they aren\u2019t eighteen anymore.</p><p>\u201cNow, if people get fat,\u201d he said meditatively, \u201cthey change some. It\u2019s harder to see who they were, because the faces change. But you\u201d\u2014he squinted at me again\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re never going to be fat; you don\u2019t have the genes for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d I said. I looked down at my hands, clasped together in my lap. Slender wristbones; at least I wasn\u2019t fat yet. My rings gleamed in the autumn sun from the window.</p><p>\u201cIs it Bree\u2019s daddy?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>I jerked my head up and stared at him. \u201cHow the hell did you know that?\u201d I said.</p><p>He smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve known Bree how long? Ten years, at least.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s got a lot of you in her, L. J., but I\u2019ve never seen anything of Frank. Daddy\u2019s got red hair, huh?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd he\u2019s one big son of a bitch, or everything I learned in Genetics 101 was a damn lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and felt a kind of delirious excitement at that simple admission. Until I had told Bree herself and Roger about Jamie, I had said nothing about him for twenty years. The joy of suddenly being able to talk freely about him was intoxicating.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s big and red-haired, and he\u2019s Scottish,\u201d I said, making Joe\u2019s eyes go round once more.</p><p>\u201cAnd Bree\u2019s in Scotland now?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBree is where the favor comes in.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, I left the hospital for the last time, leaving behind me a letter of resignation, addressed to the Hospital Board, all the necessary documents for the handling of my property until Brianna should be of age, and another one, to be executed at that time, turning everything over to her. As I drove out of the parking lot, I experienced a feeling of mingled panic, regret, and elation. I was on my way.</p><p>21</p><p>Q.E.D</p><p>Inverness</p><p>October 5, 1968</p><p>\u201cI found the deed of sasine.\u201d Roger\u2019s face was flushed with excitement. He had hardly been able to contain himself, waiting with open impatience at the train station in Inverness while Brianna hugged me and my bags were retrieved. He had barely got us stuffed into his tiny Morris and the car\u2019s ignition started before blurting out his news.</p><p>\u201cWhat, for Lallybroch?\u201d I leaned over the seat back between him and Brianna, in order to hear him over the noise of the motor.</p><p>\u201cYes, the one Jamie\u2014your Jamie\u2014wrote, deeding the property to his nephew, the younger Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at the manse,\u201d Brianna put in, twisting to look at me. \u201cWe were afraid to bring it with us; Roger had to sign his name in blood to get it out of the SPA collection.\u201d Her fair skin was pinkened by excitement and the chilly day, raindrops in her ruddy hair. It was always a shock to me to see her again after an absence\u2014mothers always think their children beautiful, but Bree really was.</p><p>I smiled at her, glowing with affection tinged with panic. Could I really be thinking of leaving her? Mistaking the smile for one of pleasure in the news, she went on, gripping the back of the seat in excitement.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never guess what else we found!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you found,\u201d Roger corrected, squeezing her knee with one hand as he negotiated the tiny orange car through a roundabout. She gave him a quick glance and a reciprocal touch with an air of intimacy about it that set off my maternal alarm bells on the spot. Like that already, was it?</p><p>I seemed to feel Frank\u2019s shade glaring accusingly over my shoulder. Well, at least Roger wasn\u2019t black. I coughed and said, \u201cReally? What is it?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a glance and grinned widely at each other.</p><p>\u201cWait and see, Mama,\u201d said Bree, with irritating smugness.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she said, twenty minutes later, as I bent over the desk in the manse\u2019s study. On the battered surface of the late Reverend Wakefield\u2019s desk lay a sheaf of yellowed papers, foxed and browned at the edges. They were carefully enclosed in protective plastic covers now, but obviously had been carelessly used at one time; the edges were tattered, one sheet was torn roughly in half, and all the sheets had notes and annotations scribbled in the margins and inserted in the text. This was obviously someone\u2019s rough draft\u2014of something.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the text of an article,\u201d Roger told me, shuffling through a pile of huge folio volumes that lay on the sofa. \u201cIt was published in a sort of journal called Forrester\u2019s, put out by a printer called Alexander Malcolm, in Edinburgh, in 1765.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, my shirtwaist dress feeling suddenly too tight under the arms; 1765 was almost twenty years past the time when I had left Jamie.</p><p>I stared at the scrawling letters, browned with age. They were written by someone of difficult penmanship, here cramped and there sprawling, with exaggerated loops on \u201cg\u201d and \u201cy.\u201d Perhaps the writing of a left-handed man, who wrote most painfully with his right hand.</p><p>\u201cSee, here\u2019s the published version.\u201d Roger brought the opened folio to the desk and laid it before me, pointing. \u201cSee the date? It\u2019s 1765, and it matches this handwritten manuscript almost exactly; only a few of the marginal notes aren\u2019t included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the deed of sasine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere it is.\u201d Brianna fumbled hastily in the top drawer and pulled out a much crumpled paper, likewise encased in protective plastic. Protection here was even more after the fact than with the manuscript; the paper was rain-spattered, filthy and torn, many of the words blurred beyond recognition. But the three signatures at the bottom still showed plainly.</p><p>By my hand, read the difficult writing, here executed with such care that only the exaggerated loop of the \u201cy\u201d showed its kinship with the careless manuscript, James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser. And below, the two lines where the witnesses had signed. In a thin, fine script, Murtagh FitzGibbons Fraser, and, below that, in my own large, round hand, Claire Beauchamp Fraser.</p><p>I sat down quite suddenly, putting my hand over the document instinctively, as though to deny its reality.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Roger quietly. His outward composure was belied by his hands, trembling slightly as he lifted the stack of manuscript pages to set them next to the deed. \u201cYou signed it. Proof positive\u2014if we needed it,\u201d he added, with a quick glance at Bree.</p><p>She shook her head, letting her hair fall down to hide her face. They didn\u2019t need it, either of them. The vanishing of Geilie Duncan through the stones five months before had been all the evidence anyone could need as to the truth of my story.</p><p>Still, having it all laid out in black and white was rather staggering. I took my hand away and looked again at the deed, and then at the handwritten manuscript.</p><p>\u201cIs it the same, Mama?\u201d Bree bent anxiously over the pages, her hair brushing softly against my hand. \u201cThe article wasn\u2019t signed\u2014or it was, but with a pseudonym.\u201d She smiled briefly. \u201cThe author signed himself \u2018Q.E.D.\u2019 It looked the same to us, but we aren\u2019t either of us handwriting experts and we didn\u2019t want to give these to an expert until you\u2019d seen them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think so.\u201d I felt breathless, but quite certain at the same time, with an upwelling of incredulous joy. \u201cYes, I\u2019m almost sure. Jamie wrote this.\u201d Q.E.D., indeed! I had an absurd urge to tear the manuscript pages out of their plastic shrouds and clutch them in my hands, to feel the ink and paper he had touched; the certain evidence that he had survived.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more. Internal evidence.\u201d Roger\u2019s voice betrayed his pride. \u201cSee there? It\u2019s an article against the Excise Act of 1764, advocating the repeal of the restrictions on export of liquor from the Scottish Highlands to England. Here it is\u201d\u2014his racing finger stopped suddenly on a phrase\u2014\u201c\u2018for as has been known for ages past, \u201cFreedom and Whisky gang tegither.\u201d \u2019 See how he\u2019s put that Scottish dialect phrase in quotes? He got it from somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got it from me,\u201d I said softly. \u201cI told him that\u2014when he was setting out to steal Prince Charles\u2019s port.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remembered.\u201d Roger nodded, eyes shining with excitement. \u201cBut it\u2019s a quote from Burns,\u201d I said, frowning suddenly. \u201cPerhaps the writer got it there\u2014wasn\u2019t Burns alive then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was,\u201d said Bree smugly, forestalling Roger. \u201cBut Robert Burns was six years old in 1765.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jamie would be forty-four.\u201d Suddenly, it all seemed real. He was alive\u2014had been alive, I corrected myself, trying to keep my emotions in check. I laid my fingers flat against the manuscript pages, trembling.</p><p>\u201cAnd if\u2014\u201d I said, and had to stop to swallow again.</p><p>\u201cAnd if time goes on in parallel, as we think it does\u2014\u201d Roger stopped, too, looking at me. Then his eyes shifted to Brianna.</p><p>She had gone quite pale, but both lips and eyes were steady, and her fingers were warm when she touched my hand.</p> <p>\u201cThen you can go back, Mama,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou can find him.\u201d</p><p>The plastic hangers rattled against the steel tubing of the dress rack as I thumbed my way slowly through the available selection.</p><p>\u201cCan I be helpin\u2019 ye at all, miss?\u201d The salesgirl peered up at me like a helpful Pekingese, blue-ringed eyes barely visible through bangs that brushed the top of her nose.</p><p>\u201cHave you got any more of these old-fashioned sorts of dresses?\u201d I gestured at the rack before me, thick with examples of the current craze\u2014laced-bodiced, long-skirted dresses in gingham cotton and velveteen.</p><p>The salesgirl\u2019s mouth was caked so thickly that I expected the white lipstick to crack when she smiled, but it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d she said. \u201cGot a new lot o\u2019 the Jessica Gutenburgs in just today. Aren\u2019t they the grooviest, these old-style gowns?\u201d She ran an admiring finger over a brown velvet sleeve, then whirled on her ballet flats and pointed toward the center of the store. \u201cJust there, aye? Where it says, on the sign.\u201d</p> <p>The sign, stuck on the top of a circular rack, said CAPTURE THE CHARM OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY in large white letters across the top. Just below, in curlicue script, was the signature, Jessica Gutenburg.</p><p>Reflecting on the basic improbability of anyone actually being named Jessica Gutenburg, I waded through the contents of the rack, pausing at a truly stunning number in cream velvet, with satin inserts and a good deal of lace.</p><p>\u201cLook lovely on, that would.\u201d The Pekingese was back, pug nose sniffing hopefully for a sale.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d I said, \u201cbut not very practical. You\u2019d get filthy just walking out of the store.\u201d I pushed the white dress away with some regret, proceeding to the next size ten.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just love the red ones!\u201d The girl clasped her hands in ecstasy at the brilliant garnet fabric.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d I murmured, \u201cbut we don\u2019t want to look too garish. Wouldn\u2019t do to be taken for a prostitute, would it?\u201d The Peke gave me a startled look through the thickets, then decided I was joking, and giggled appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cNow, that one,\u201d she said decisively, reaching past me, \u201cthat\u2019s perfect, that is. That\u2019s your color, here.\u201d</p><p>Actually, it was almost perfect. Floor-length, with three-quarter sleeves edged with lace. A deep, tawny gold, with shimmers of brown and amber and sherry in the heavy silk.</p> <p>I lifted it carefully off the rack and held it up to examine it. A trifle fancy, but it might do. The construction seemed halfway decent; no loose threads or unraveling seams. The machine-made lace on the bodice was just tacked on, but that would be easy enough to reinforce.</p><p>\u201cWant to try it on? The dressing rooms are just over there.\u201d The Peke was frisking about near my elbow, encouraged by my interest. Taking a quick look at the price tag, I could see why; she must work on commission. I took a deep breath at the figure, which would cover a month\u2019s rent on a London flat, but then shrugged. After all, what did I need money for?</p><p>Still, I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d I said doubtfully, \u201cit is lovely. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry a bit about it\u2019s being too young for you,\u201d the Pekingese reassured me earnestly. \u201cYou don\u2019t look a day over twenty-five! Well...maybe thirty,\u201d she concluded lamely, after a quick glance at my face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t worried about that, though. I don\u2019t suppose you have any without zippers, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZippers?\u201d Her small round face went quite blank beneath the makeup. \u201cErm...no. Don\u2019t think we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not to worry,\u201d I said, taking the dress over my arm and turning toward the dressing room. \u201cIf I go through with this, zippers will be the least of it.\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>ALL HALLOWS\u2019 EVE</p><p>Two golden guineas, six sovereigns, twenty-three shillings, eighteen florins ninepence, ten halfpence, and...twelve farthings.\u201d Roger dropped the last coin on the tinkling pile, then dug into his shirt pocket, lean face absorbed as he searched. \u201cOh, here.\u201d He brought out a small plastic bag and carefully poured a handful of tiny copper coins into a pile alongside the other money.</p><p>\u201cDoits,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe smallest denomination of Scottish coinage of the time. I got as many as I could, because that\u2019s likely what you\u2019d use most of the time. You wouldn\u2019t use the large coins unless you had to buy a horse or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I picked up a couple of sovereigns and tilted them in my hand, letting them clink together. They were heavy\u2014gold coins, nearly an inch in diameter. It had taken Roger and Bree four days in London, going from one rare-coin dealer to the next, to assemble the small fortune gleaming in the lamplight before me.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny; these coins are worth a lot more now than their face value,\u201d I said, picking up a golden guinea, \u201cbut in terms of what they\u2019ll buy, they were worth then just about as much as now. This is six months\u2019 income for a small farmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was forgetting,\u201d Roger said, \u201cthat you know all this already; what things were worth and how they were sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget,\u201d I said, eyes still on the money. From the corner of my vision, I saw Bree draw suddenly close to Roger, and his hand go out to her automatically.</p><p>I took a deep breath and looked up from the tiny heaps of gold and silver. \u201cWell, that\u2019s that. Shall we go and have some dinner?\u201d</p><p>Dinner\u2014at one of the pubs on River Street\u2014was a largely silent affair. Claire and Brianna sat side by side on the banquette, with Roger opposite. They barely looked at each other while they ate, but Roger could see the frequent small touches, the tiny nudges of shoulder and hip, the brushing of fingers that went on.</p><p>How would he manage, he wondered to himself. If it were his choice, or his parent? Separation came to all families, but most often it was death that intervened, to sever the ties between parent and child. It was the element of choice here that made it so difficult\u2014not that it could ever be easy, he thought, forking in a mouthful of hot shepherd\u2019s pie.</p><p>As they rose to leave after supper, he laid a hand on Claire\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cJust for the sake of nothing,\u201d he said, \u201cwill you try something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect so,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded at the door. \u201cClose your eyes and step out of the door. When you\u2019re outside, open them. Then come in and tell me what\u2019s the first thing you saw.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched with amusement. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll hope the first thing I see isn\u2019t a policeman, or you\u2019ll have to come bail me out of jail for being drunk and disorderly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as it isn\u2019t a duck.\u201d</p><p>Claire gave him a queer look, but obediently turned toward the door of the pub and closed her eyes. Brianna watched her mother disappear through the door, hand extended to the paneling of the entry to keep her bearings. She turned to Roger, copper eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, Roger? Ducks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, eyes still fixed on the empty entrance. \u201cIt\u2019s just an old custom. Samhain\u2014Hallowe\u2019en, you know?\u2014that\u2019s one of the feasts when it was customary to try to divine the future. And one of the ways of divination was to walk to the end of the house, and then step outside with your eyes closed. The first thing you see when you open them is an omen for the near future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDucks are bad omens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said absently, still watching the entry. \u201cIf they have their heads under their wings, that\u2019s death. What\u2019s keeping her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019d better go see,\u201d Brianna said nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t expect there are a lot of sleeping ducks in downtown Inverness, but with the river so close...\u201d</p><p>Just as they reached the door, though, its stained-glass window darkened and it swung open to reveal Claire, looking mildly flustered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never believe what\u2019s the first thing I saw,\u201d she said, laughing as she saw them.</p><p>\u201cNot a duck with its head under its wing?\u201d asked Brianna anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her mother said, giving her a puzzled look. \u201cA policeman. I turned to the right and ran smack into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was coming toward you, then?\u201d Roger felt inexplicably relieved.</p><p>\u201cWell, he was until I ran into him,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we waltzed round the pavement a bit, clutching each other.\u201d She laughed, looking flushed and pretty, with her brown-sherry eyes sparkling in the amber pub lights. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good luck,\u201d Roger said, smiling. \u201cTo see a man coming toward you on Samhain means you\u2019ll find what you seek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it?\u201d Her eyes rested on his, quizzical, then her face lit with a sudden smile. \u201cWonderful! Let\u2019s go home and celebrate, shall we?\u201d</p><p>The anxious constraint that had lain on them over dinner seemed suddenly to have vanished, to be replaced with a sort of manic excitement, and they laughed and joked on the trip back to the manse, where they drank toasts to past and future\u2014Loch Minneaig Scotch for Claire and Roger, Coca-Cola for Brianna\u2014and talked excitedly about the plans for the next day. Brianna had insisted on carving a pumpkin into a jack-o\u2019-lantern, which sat on the sideboard, grinning benevolently on the proceedings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the money, now,\u201d Roger said, for the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cAnd your cloak,\u201d Brianna chimed in.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d Claire said impatiently. \u201cEverything I need\u2014or everything I can manage, at least,\u201d she amended. She paused, then impulsively reached out and took both Bree and Roger by the hand.</p><p>\u201cThank you both,\u201d she said, squeezing their hands. Her eyes shone moist, and her voice was suddenly husky. \u201cThank you. I can\u2019t say what I feel. I can\u2019t. But\u2014oh, my dears, I will miss you!\u201d</p> <p>Then she and Bree were in each other\u2019s arms, Claire\u2019s head tucked into her daughter\u2019s neck, the both of them hugged tight, as though simple force could somehow express the depth of feeling between them.</p><p>Then they broke apart, eyes wet, and Claire laid a hand on her daughter\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019d better go up now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThere are things to do, still. I\u2019ll see you in the morning, Baby.\u201d She rose on tiptoe to plant a kiss on her daughter\u2019s nose, then turned and hurried from the room.</p><p>After her mother\u2019s exit, Brianna sat down again with her glass of Coke, and heaved a deep sigh. She didn\u2019t speak, but sat looking into the fire, turning the glass slowly between her hands.</p><p>Roger busied himself, setting the room to rights for the night, closing the windows, tidying the desk, putting away the reference books he had used to help Claire prepare for her journey. He paused by the jack-o\u2019-lantern, but it looked so jolly, with the candlelight streaming from its slanted eyes and jagged mouth, that he couldn\u2019t bring himself to blow it out.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s likely to set anything on fire,\u201d he remarked. \u201cShall we leave it?\u201d</p> <p>There was no answer. When he glanced at Brianna, he found her sitting still as stone, eyes fixed on the hearth. She hadn\u2019t heard him. He sat down beside her and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cShe might be able to come back,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Brianna shook her head slowly, not taking her eyes from the leaping flames.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said softly. \u201cShe told you what it was like. She may not even make it through.\u201d Long fingers drummed restlessly on a denimed thigh.</p><p>Roger glanced at the door, to be sure that Claire was safely upstairs, then sat down on the sofa next to Brianna.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs with him, Bree,\u201d he said. \u201cCan ye not see it? When she speaks of him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see it. I know she needs him.\u201d The full lower lip trembled slightly. \u201cBut...I need her!\u201d Brianna\u2019s hands clenched suddenly tight on her knees, and she bent forward, as though trying to contain some sudden pain.</p><p>Roger stroked her hair, marveling at the softness of the glowing strands that slid through his fingers. He wanted to take her into his arms, as much for the feel of her as to offer comfort, but she was rigid and unresponsive.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re grown, Bree,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou live on your own now, don\u2019t you? You may love her, but you don\u2019t need her anymore\u2014not the way you did when you were small. Has she no right to her own joy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But...Roger, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d she burst out. She pressed her lips tight together and swallowed hard, then turned to him, eyes dark with distress.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all that\u2019s left, Roger! The only one who really knows me. She and Daddy\u2014Frank\u201d\u2014she corrected herself\u2014\u201cthey were the ones who knew me from the beginning, the ones who saw me learn to walk and were proud of me when I did something good in school, and who\u2014\u201d She broke off, and the tears overflowed, leaving gleaming tracks in the firelight.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds really dumb,\u201d she said with sudden violence. \u201cReally, really dumb! But it\u2019s\u2014\u201d she groped, helpless, then sprang to her feet, unable to stay still.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like\u2014there are all these things I don\u2019t even know!\u201d she said, pacing with quick, angry steps. \u201cDo you think I remember what I looked like, learning to walk, or what the first word I said was? No, but Mama does! And that\u2019s so stupid, because what difference does it make, it doesn\u2019t make any difference at all, but it\u2019s important, it matters because she thought it was, and...oh, Roger, if she\u2019s gone, there won\u2019t be a soul left in the world who cares what I\u2019m like, or thinks I\u2019m special not because of anything, but just because I\u2019m me! She\u2019s the only person in the world who really, really cares I was born, and if she\u2019s gone...\u201d She stood still on the hearthrug, hands clenched at her sides, and mouth twisted with the effort to control herself, tears wet on her cheeks. Then her shoulders slumped and the tension went out of her tall figure.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s just really dumb and selfish,\u201d she said, in a quietly reasonable tone. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t understand, and you think I\u2019m awful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said quietly. \u201cI think maybe not.\u201d He stood and came behind her, putting his arms around her waist, urging her to lean back against him. She resisted at first, stiff in his arms, but then yielded to the need for physical comfort and relaxed, his chin propped on her shoulder, head tilted to touch her own.</p><p>\u201cI never realized,\u201d he said. \u201cNot \u2019til now. D\u2019ye remember all those boxes in the garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich ones?\u201d she said, with a sniffling attempt at a laugh. \u201cThere are hundreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that say \u2018Roger\u2019 on them.\u201d He gave her a slight squeeze and brought his arms up, crisscrossed on her chest, holding her snug against himself.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re full of my parents\u2019 old clobber,\u201d he said. \u201cPictures and letters and baby clothes and books and old bits of rubbish. The Reverend packed them up when he took me to live with him. Treated them just like his most precious historical documents\u2014double-boxing, and mothproofing and all that.\u201d</p><p>He rocked slowly back and forth, swaying from side to side, carrying her with him as he watched the fire over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI asked him once why he bothered to keep them\u2014I didn\u2019t want any of it, didn\u2019t care. But he said we\u2019d keep it just the same; it was my history, he said\u2014and everyone needs a history.\u201d</p><p>Brianna sighed, and her body seemed to relax still further, joining him in his rhythmic, half-unconscious sway.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever look inside them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t important what\u2019s in them,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly that they\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her then, and stepped back so that she turned to face him. Her face was blotched and her long, elegant nose a little swollen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, you know,\u201d he said softly, and held out his hand to her. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only your mother who cares.\u201d</p><p>Brianna had gone to bed long since, but Roger sat on in the study, watching the flames die down in the hearth. Hallowe\u2019en had always seemed to him a restless night, alive with waking spirits. Tonight was even more so, with the knowledge of what would happen in the morning. The jack-o\u2019-lantern on the desk grinned in anticipation, filling the room with the homely scent of baking pies.</p><p>The sound of a footfall on the stair roused him from his thoughts. He had thought it might be Brianna, unable to sleep, but the visitor was Claire.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might still be awake,\u201d she said. She was in her nightdress, a pale glimmer of white satin against the dark hallway.</p><p>He smiled and stretched out a hand, inviting her in. \u201cNo. I never could sleep on All Hallows\u2019. Not after all the stories my father told me; I always thought I could hear ghosts talking outside my window.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, coming into the firelight. \u201cAnd what did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018See\u2019st thou this great gray head, with jaws which have no meat?\u2019\u201d Roger quoted. \u201cYou know the story? The little tailor who spent the night in a haunted church, and met the hungry ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I think if I\u2019d heard that outside my window, I\u2019d have spent the rest of the night hiding under the bedclothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I usually did,\u201d Roger assured her. \u201cThough once, when I was seven or so, I got up my nerve, stood up on the bed and peed on the windowsill\u2014the Reverend had just told me that pissing on the doorposts is supposed to keep a ghost from coming in the house.\u201d</p><p>Claire laughed delightedly, the firelight dancing in her eyes. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it would have worked better had the window been open,\u201d Roger said, \u201cbut the ghosts didn\u2019t come in, no.\u201d</p><p>They laughed together, and then one of the small awkward silences that had punctuated the evening fell between them, the sudden realization of enormity gaping beneath the tightrope of conversation. Claire sat beside him, watching the fire, her hands moving restlessly among the folds of her gown. The light winked from her wedding rings, silver and gold, in sparks of fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her, you know,\u201d Roger said quietly, at last. \u201cYou do know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Claire nodded, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly. He could see the tears, caught trembling at the edge of her lashes, glowing with firelight. She fumbled in the pocket of her gown, and drew out a long white envelope.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think me a dreadful coward,\u201d she said, \u201cand I am. But I...I honestly don\u2019t think I can do it\u2014say goodbye to Bree, I mean.\u201d She stopped, to bring her voice under control, and then held out the envelope to him.</p><p>\u201cI wrote it all down for her\u2014everything I could. Will you...?\u201d</p><p>Roger took the envelope. It was warm from resting next to her body. From some obscure feeling that it must not be allowed to grow cold before it reached her daughter, he thrust it into his own breast pocket, feeling the crackle of paper as the envelope bent.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, hearing his own voice thicken. \u201cThen you\u2019ll go...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly,\u201d she said, taking a deep breath. \u201cBefore dawn. I\u2019ve arranged for a car to pick me up.\u201d Her hands twisted together in her lap. \u201cIf I\u2014\u201d She bit her lip, then looked at Roger pleadingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know, you see,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I can do it. I\u2019m very much afraid. Afraid to go. Afraid not to go. Just\u2014afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be, too.\u201d He held out his hand and she took it. He held it for a long time, feeling the pulse in her wrist, light and fast against his fingers.</p><p>After a long time, she squeezed his hand gently and let go.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Roger,\u201d she said. \u201cFor everything.\u201d She leaned over and kissed him lightly on the lips. Then she rose and went out, a white ghost in the darkness of the hall, borne on the Hallowe\u2019en wind.</p><p>Roger sat on for some time alone, feeling her touch still warm on his skin. The jack-o\u2019-lantern was nearly burned out. The smell of candle wax rose strongly in the restless air, and the pagan gods looked out for the last time, through eyes of guttering flame.</p><p>23</p><p>CRAIGH NA DUN</p><p>The early morning air was cold and misty, and I was glad of the cloak. It had been twenty years since I\u2019d worn one, but with the sorts of things people wore nowadays, the Inverness tailor who\u2019d made it for me had not found an order for a woolen cloak with a hood at all odd. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I kept my eyes on the path. The crest of the hill had been invisible, wreathed in mist, when the car had left me on the road below.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d the driver had said, peering dubiously out of his window at the deserted countryside. \u201cSure, mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I\u2019d said, half-choked with terror. \u201cThis is the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d He looked dubious, in spite of the large note I put in his hand. \u201cD\u2019ye want me to wait, mum? Or to come later, to fetch ye back?\u201d</p> <p>I was sorely tempted to say yes. After all, what if I lost my nerve? At the moment, my grip on that slippery substance seemed remarkably feeble.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, swallowing. \u201cNo, that won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d If I couldn\u2019t do it, I would just have to walk back to Inverness, that was all. Or perhaps Roger and Brianna would come; I thought that would be worse, to be ignominiously retrieved. Or would it be a relief?</p><p>The granite pebbles rolled beneath my feet and a clod of dirt fell in a small rushing shower, dislodged by my passage. I couldn\u2019t possibly really be doing this, I thought. The weight of the money in my reinforced pocket swung against my thigh, the heavy certainty of gold and silver a reminder of reality. I was doing it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. Thoughts of Bree as I had seen her late last night, peacefully asleep in her bed, assaulted me. The tendrils of remembered horror reached out from the hilltop above, as I began to sense the nearness of the stones. Screaming, chaos, the feeling of being torn in pieces. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t, but I kept on climbing, palms sweating, my feet moving as though no longer under my control.</p> <p>It was full dawn by the time I reached the top of the hill. The mist lay below, and the stones stood clear and dark against a crystal sky. The sight of them left me wet-palmed with apprehension, but I walked forward, and passed into the circle.</p><p>They were standing on the grass in front of the cleft stone, facing each other. Brianna heard my footsteps and whirled around to face me.</p><p>I stared at her, speechless with astonishment. She was wearing a Jessica Gutenburg dress, very much like the one I had on, except that hers was a vivid lime green, with plastic jewels stitched across the bosom.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a perfectly horrible color for you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only one they had in a size sixteen,\u201d she answered calmly.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of goodness are you doing here?\u201d I demanded, recovering some remnant of coherence.</p> <p>\u201cWe came to see you off,\u201d she said, and a hint of a smile flickered on her lips. I looked at Roger, who shrugged slightly and gave me a lopsided smile of his own.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. Well,\u201d I said. The stone stood behind Brianna, twice the height of a man. I could look through the foot-wide crack, and see the faint morning sun shining on the grass outside the circle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cor I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou! Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced at the cleft stone and swallowed. It might have been the lime-green dress that made her face look chalk-white. \u201cI can do it\u2014go through, I mean. I know I can. When Geilie Duncan went through the stones, I heard them. Roger did too.\u201d She glanced at him as though for reassurance, then fixed her gaze firmly on me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I could find Jamie Fraser or not; maybe only you can. But if you won\u2019t try, then I will.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened, but I couldn\u2019t find anything to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see, Mama? He has to know\u2014has to know he did it, he did what he meant to for us.\u201d Her lips quivered, and she pressed them together for a minute.</p> <p>\u201cWe owe it to him, Mama,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSomebody has to find him, and tell him.\u201d Her hand touched my face, briefly. \u201cTell him I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bree,\u201d I said, my voice so choked I could barely speak. \u201cOh, Bree!\u201d</p><p>She was holding my hands tight between her own, squeezing hard.</p><p>\u201cHe gave you to me,\u201d she said, so low I could hardly hear her. \u201cNow I have to give you back to him, Mama.\u201d</p><p>The eyes that were so like Jamie\u2019s looked down at me, blurred by tears.</p><p>\u201cIf you find him,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwhen you find my father\u2014give him this.\u201d She bent and kissed me, fiercely, gently, then straightened and turned me toward the stone.</p><p>\u201cGo, Mama,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cI love you. Go!\u201d</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Roger move toward her. I took one step, and then another. I heard a sound, a faint roaring. I took the last step, and the world disappeared.</p><p>PART SIX</p><p>Edinburgh</p><p>24</p><p>A. MALCOLM, PRINTER</p><p>My first coherent thought was, \u201cIt\u2019s raining. This must be Scotland.\u201d My second thought was that this observation was no great improvement over the random images jumbling around inside my head, banging into each other and setting off small synaptic explosions of irrelevance.</p><p>I opened one eye, with some difficulty. The lid was stuck shut, and my entire face felt cold and puffy, like a submerged corpse\u2019s. I shuddered faintly at the thought, the slight movement making me aware of the sodden fabric all around me.</p><p>It was certainly raining\u2014a soft, steady drum of rain that raised a faint mist of droplets above the green moor. I sat up, feeling like a hippopotamus emerging from a bog, and promptly fell over backward.</p><p>I blinked and closed my eyes against the downpour. Some small sense of who I was\u2014and where I was\u2014was beginning to come back to me. Bree. Her face emerged suddenly into memory, with a jolt that made me gasp as though I\u2019d been punched in the stomach. Jagged images of loss and the rip of separation pulled at me, a faint echo of the chaos in the stone passage.</p><p>Jamie. There it was; the anchor point to which I had clung, my single hold on sanity. I breathed slow and deep, hands folded over my pounding heart, summoning Jamie\u2019s face. For a moment, I thought I had lost him, and then it came, clear and bold in my mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>Once again, I struggled upright, and this time stayed, propped by my outstretched hands. Yes, certainly it was Scotland. It could hardly by anything else, of course, but it was also the Scotland of the past. At least, I hoped it was the past. It wasn\u2019t the Scotland I\u2019d left, at any rate. The trees and bushes grew in different patterns; there was a patch of maple saplings just below me that hadn\u2019t been there when I\u2019d climbed the hill\u2014when? That morning? Two days ago?</p><p>I had no idea how much time had passed since I had entered the standing stones, or how long I had lain unconscious on the hillside below the circle. Quite a while, judging from the sogginess of my clothing; I was soaked through to the skin, and small chilly rivulets ran down my sides under my gown.</p><p>One numbed cheek was beginning to tingle; putting my hand to it, I could feel a pattern of incised bumps. I looked down and saw a layer of fallen rowan berries, gleaming red and black among the grass. Very appropriate, I thought, vaguely amused. I had fallen down under a rowan\u2014the Highland protection against witchcraft and enchantment.</p><p>I grasped the smooth trunk of the rowan tree, and laboriously hauled myself to my feet. Still holding onto the tree for support, I looked to the northeast. The rain had faded the horizon to a gray invisibility, but I knew that Inverness lay in that direction. No more than an hour\u2019s trip by car, along modern roads.</p><p>The road existed; I could see the outline of a rough track that led along the base of the hill, a dark, silvery line in the gleaming green wetness of the moor plants. However, forty-odd miles on foot was a far cry from the journey by car that had brought me here.</p><p>I was beginning to feel somewhat better, standing up. The weakness in my limbs was fading, along with the feeling of chaos and disruption in my mind. It had been as bad as I\u2019d feared, this passage; perhaps worse. I could feel the terrible presence of the stones above me, and shuddered, my skin prickling with cold.</p><p>I was alive, though. Alive, and with a small feeling of certainty, like a tiny glowing sun beneath my ribs. He was here. I knew it now, though I hadn\u2019t known it when I threw myself between the stones; that had been a leap of faith. But I had cast out my thought of Jamie like a lifeline tossed into a raging torrent\u2014and the line had tightened in my grasp, and pulled me free.</p><p>I was wet, cold, and felt battered, as though I had been washing about in the surf against a rocky shore. But I was here. And somewhere in this strange country of the past was the man I had come to find. The memories of grief and terror were receding, as I realized that my die was cast. I could not go back; a return trip would almost surely be fatal. As I realized that I was likely here to stay, all hesitations and terrors were superseded by a strange calm, almost exultant. I could not go back. There was nothing to do but go forward\u2014to find him.</p><p>Cursing my carelessness in not having thought to tell the tailor to make my cloak with a waterproof layer between fabric and lining, I pulled the water-soaked garment closer. Even wet, the wool held some warmth. If I began to move, I would grow warmer. A quick pat reassured me that my bundle of sandwiches had made the trip with me. That was good; the thought of walking forty miles on an empty stomach was a daunting one.</p><p>With luck, I wouldn\u2019t have to. I might find a village or a house that had a horse I could buy. But if not, I was prepared. My plan was to go to Inverness\u2014by whatever means offered itself\u2014and there take a public coach to Edinburgh.</p><p>There was no telling where Jamie was at the moment. He might be in Edinburgh, where his article had been published, but he might easily be somewhere else. If I could not find him there, I could go to Lallybroch, his home. Surely his family would know where he was\u2014if any of them were left. The sudden thought chilled me, and I shivered.</p><p>I thought of a small bookstore that I passed every morning on my way from the parking lot to the hospital. They had been having a sale on posters; I had seen the display of psychedelic examples when I left Joe\u2019s office for the last time.</p><p>\u201cToday is the first day of the rest of your life,\u201d said one poster, above an illustration of a foolish-looking chick, absurdly poking its head out of an eggshell. In the other window, another poster showed a caterpillar, inching its way up a flower stalk. Above the stalk soared a brilliantly colored butterfly, and below was the motto \u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d</p><p>The most irritating thing about clich\u00e9s, I decided, was how frequently they were true. I let go of the rowan tree, and started down the hill toward my future.</p><p>It was a long, jolting ride from Inverness to Edinburgh, crammed cheek by jowl into a large coach with two other ladies, the small and whiny son of one of the ladies, and four gentlemen of varying sizes and dispositions.</p><p>Mr. Graham, a small and vivacious gentleman of advanced years who was seated next to me, was wearing a bag of camphor and asafoetida about his neck, to the eyewatering discomfort of the rest of the coach.</p><p>\u201cCapital for dispelling the evil humors of influenza,\u201d he explained to me, waving the bag gently under my nose like a censer. \u201cI have worn this daily through the autumn and winter months, and haven\u2019t been sick a day in nearly thirty years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d I said politely, trying to hold my breath. I didn\u2019t doubt it; the fumes probably kept everyone at such a distance that germs couldn\u2019t reach him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The effects on the little boy didn\u2019t seem nearly so beneficial. After a number of loud and injudicious remarks about the smell in the coach, Master Georgie had been muffled in his mother\u2019s bosom, from which he now peeped, looking rather green. I kept a close eye on him, as well as on the chamber pot beneath the seat opposite, in case quick action involving a conjunction of the two should be called for.</p><p>I gathered that the chamber pot was for use in inclement weather or other emergency, as normally the ladies\u2019 modesty required stops every hour or so, at which point the passengers would scatter into the roadside vegetation like a covey of quail, even those who did not require relief of bladder or bowels seeking some relief from the stench of Mr. Graham\u2019s asafoetida bag.</p><p>After one or two changes, Mr. Graham found his place beside me superseded by Mr. Wallace, a plump young lawyer, returning to Edinburgh after seeing to the disposition of the estate of an elderly relative in Inverness, as he explained to me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t find the details of his legal practice nearly as fascinating as he did, but under the circumstances, his evident attraction to me was mildly reassuring, and I passed several hours in playing with him upon a small chess set that he produced from a pocket and laid upon his knee.</p> <p>My attention was distracted both from the discomforts of the journey and the intricacies of chess by anticipation of what I might find in Edinburgh. A. Malcolm. The name kept running through my mind like an anthem of hope. A. Malcolm. It had to be Jamie, it simply had to! James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cConsidering the way the Highland rebels were treated after Culloden, it would be very reasonable for him to use an assumed name in a place like Edinburgh,\u201d Roger Wakefield had explained to me. \u201cParticularly him\u2014he was a convicted traitor, after all. Made rather a habit of it, too, it looks like,\u201d he had added critically, looking over the scrawled manuscript of the antitax diatribe. \u201cFor the times, this is bloody near sedition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that sounds like Jamie,\u201d I had said dryly, but my heart had leapt at the sight of that distinctively untidy scrawl, with its boldly worded sentiments. My Jamie. I touched the small hard rectangle in my skirt pocket, wondering how long it would be, before we reached Edinburgh.</p><p>The weather kept unseasonably fine, with no more than the occasional drizzle to hinder our passage, and we completed the journey in less than two days, stopping four times to change horses and refresh ourselves at posthouse taverns.</p><p>The coach debouched into a yard at the back of Boyd\u2019s Whitehorse tavern, near the foot of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. The passengers emerged into the watery sunshine like newly hatched chrysalids, rumpled of wing and jerky in movement, unaccustomed to mobility. After the dimness of the coach, even the cloudy gray light of Edinburgh seemed blinding.</p> <p>I had pins and needles in my feet from so long sitting, but hurried nonetheless, hoping to escape from the courtyard while my erstwhile companions were busy with the retrieval of their belongings. No such luck; Mr. Wallace caught up with me near the street.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser!\u201d he said. \u201cMight I beg the pleasure of accompanying you to your destination? You will surely require some assistance in the removal of your luggage.\u201d He looked over his shoulder toward the coach, where the ostlers were heaving the bags and portmanteaux apparently at random into the crowd, to the accompaniment of incoherent grunts and shouts.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I said. \u201cThank you, but I...er, I\u2019m leaving my luggage in charge of the landlord. My...my...\u201d I groped frantically. \u201cMy husband\u2019s servant will come fetch it later.\u201d</p><p>His plump face fell slightly at the word \u201chusband,\u201d but he rallied gallantly, taking my hand and bowing low over it.</p><p>\u201cI quite see. May I express my profound appreciation for the pleasure of your company on our journey, then, Mrs. Fraser? And perhaps we shall meet again.\u201d He straightened up, surveying the crowd that eddied past us. \u201cIs your husband meeting you? I should be delighted to make his acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>While Mr. Wallace\u2019s interest in me had been rather flattering, it was rapidly becoming a nuisance.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I shall be joining him later,\u201d I said. \u201cSo nice to have met you, Mr. Wallace; I\u2019ll hope to see you again sometime.\u201d I shook Mr. Wallace\u2019s hand enthusiastically, which disconcerted him enough for me to slither off through the throng of passengers, ostlers and food sellers.</p><p>I didn\u2019t dare pause near the coachyard for fear he would come out after me. I turned and darted up the slope of the Royal Mile, moving as quickly as my voluminous skirts would allow, jostling and bumping my way through the crowd. I had had the luck to pick a market day for my arrival, and I was soon lost to sight from the coachyard among the luckenbooths and oyster sellers who lined the street.</p><p>Panting like an escaped pickpocket, I stopped for breath halfway up the hill. There was a public fountain here, and I sat down on the rim to catch my breath.</p><p>I was here. Really here. Edinburgh sloped up behind me, to the glowering heights of Edinburgh Castle, and down before me, to the gracious majesty of Holyrood Palace at the foot of the city.</p><p>The last time I had stood by this fountain, Bonnie Prince Charlie had been addressing the gathered citizenry of Edinburgh, inspiring them with the sight of his royal presence. He had bounded exuberantly from the rim to the carved center finial of the fountain, one foot in the basin, clinging to one of the spouting heads for support, shouting \u201cOn to England!\u201d The crowd had roared, pleased at this show of youthful high spirits and athletic prowess. I would myself have been more impressed had I not noticed that the water in the fountain had been turned off in anticipation of the gesture.</p><p>I wondered where Charlie was now. He had gone back to Italy after Culloden, I supposed, there to live whatever life was possible for royalty in permanent exile. What he was doing, I neither knew nor cared. He had passed from the pages of history, and from my life as well, leaving wreck and ruin in his wake. It remained to be seen what might be salvaged now.</p><p>I was very hungry; I had had nothing to eat since a hasty breakfast of rough parritch and boiled mutton, made soon after dawn at a posthouse in Dundaff. I had one last sandwich remaining in my pocket, but had been reluctant to eat it in the coach, under the curious gaze of my fellow travelers.</p><p>I pulled it out and carefully unwrapped it. Peanut butter and jelly on white bread, it was considerably the worse for wear, with the purple stains of the jelly seeping through the limp bread, and the whole thing mashed into a flattened wodge. It was delicious.</p> <p>I ate it carefully, savoring the rich, oily taste of the peanut butter. How many mornings had I slathered peanut butter on bread, making sandwiches for Brianna\u2019s school lunches? Firmly suppressing the thought, I examined the passersby for distraction. They did look somewhat different from their modern equivalents; both men and women tended to be shorter, and the signs of poor nutrition were evident. Still, there was an overwhelming familiarity to them\u2014these were people I knew, Scots and English for the most part, and hearing the rich burring babble of voices in the street, after so many years of the flat nasal tones of Boston, I had quite an extraordinary feeling of coming home.</p><p>I swallowed the last rich, sweet bite of my old life, and crumpled the wrapper in my hand. I glanced around, but no one was looking in my direction. I opened my hand, and let the bit of plastic film fall surreptitiously to the ground. Wadded up, it rolled a few inches on the cobbles, crinkling and unfolding itself as though alive. The light wind caught it, and the small transparent sheet took sudden wing, scudding over the gray stones like a leaf.</p><p>The draft of a set of passing wheels sucked it under a drayman\u2019s cart; it winked once with reflected light, and was gone, disappearing without notice from the passersby. I wondered whether my own anachronistic presence would cause as little harm.</p><p>\u201cYou are dithering, Beauchamp,\u201d I said to myself. \u201cTime to get on.\u201d I took a deep breath and stood up.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said, catching the sleeve of a passing baker\u2019s boy. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a printer\u2014a Mr. Malcolm. Alexander Malcolm.\u201d A feeling of mingled dread and excitement gurgled through my middle. What if there was no printshop run by Alexander Malcolm in Edinburgh?</p><p>There was, though; the boy\u2019s face screwed up in thought and then relaxed.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, mum\u2014just down the way and to your left. Carfax Close.\u201d And hitching his loaves up under his arm with a nod, he plunged back into the crowded street.</p><p>Carfax Close. I edged my way back into the crowd, pressing close to the buildings, to avoid the occasional shower of slops that splattered into the street from the windows high above. There were several thousand people in Edinburgh, and the sewage from all of them was running down the gutters of the cobbled street, depending on gravity and the frequent rain to keep the city habitable.</p><p>The low, dark opening to Carfax Close yawned just ahead, across the expanse of the Royal Mile. I stopped dead, looking at it, my heart beating hard enough to be heard a yard away, had anyone been listening.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t raining, but was just about to, and the dampness in the air made my hair curl. I pushed it off my forehead, tidying it as best I could without a mirror. Then I caught sight of a large plate-glass window up ahead, and hurried forward.</p><p>The glass was misty with condensation, but provided a dim reflection, in which my face looked flushed and wide-eyed, but otherwise presentable. My hair, however, had seized the opportunity to curl madly in all directions, and was writhing out of its hairpins in excellent imitation of Medusa\u2019s locks. I yanked the pins out impatiently, and began to twist up my curls.</p><p>There was a woman inside the shop, leaning across the counter. There were three small children with her, and I watched with half an eye as she turned from her business to address them impatiently, swatting with her reticule at the middle one, a boy who was fiddling with several stalks of fresh anise that stood in a pail of water on the floor.</p><p>It was an apothecary\u2019s shop; glancing up, I saw the name \u201cHaugh\u201d above the door, and felt a thrill of recognition. I had bought herbs here, during the brief time I had lived in Edinburgh. The decor of the window had been augmented sometime since by the addition of a large jar of colored water, in which floated something vaguely humanoid. A fetal pig, or perhaps an infant baboon; it had leering, flattened features that pressed against the rounded side of the jar in a disconcerting fashion.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least I look better than you!\u201d I muttered, shoving in a recalcitrant pin.</p><p>I looked better than the woman inside, too, I thought. Her business concluded, she was stuffing her purchase into the bag she carried, her thin face frowning as she did so. She had the rather pasty look of a city dweller, and her skin was deeply lined, with sharp creases running from nose to mouth, and a furrowed forehead.</p><p>\u201cDe\u2019il tak\u2019 ye, ye wee ratten,\u201d she was saying crossly to the little boy as they all clattered out of the shop together. \u201cHave I no told ye time and again to keep yer paws in yer pockets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I stepped forward, interrupting, impelled by a sudden irresistible curiosity.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Distracted from maternal remonstration, she looked blankly at me. Up close, she looked even more harried. The corners of her mouth were pinched, and her lips folded in\u2014no doubt because of missing teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help admiring your children,\u201d I said, with as much pretense of admiration as I could manage on short notice. I beamed kindly at them. \u201cSuch pretty babies! Tell me, how old are they?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped, confirming the absence of several teeth. She blinked at me, then said, \u201cOh! Well, that\u2019s maist kind o\u2019 ye, mum. Ah...Maisri here is ten,\u201d she said, nodding at the eldest girl, who was in the act of wiping her nose on her sleeve, \u201cJoey\u2019s eight\u2014tak\u2019 yer finger out o\u2019 yer nose, ye clattie imp!\u201d she hissed, then turned and proudly patted her youngest on the head. \u201cAnd wee Polly\u2019s just turned six this May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d I gazed at the woman affecting astonishment. \u201cYou scarcely look old enough to have children of that age. You must have married very young.\u201d</p><p>She preened slightly, smirking.</p> <p>\u201cOch, no! Not so young as all that; why, I was all o\u2019 nineteen when Maisri was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d I said, meaning it. I dug in my pocket and offered the children each a penny, which they took with shy bobs of thanks. \u201cGood day to you\u2014and congratulations on your lovely family,\u201d I said to the woman, and walked away with a smile and a wave.</p><p>Nineteen when the eldest was born, and Maisri was ten now. She was twenty-nine. And I, blessed by good nutrition, hygiene, and dentistry, not worn down by multiple pregnancies and hard physical labor, looked a good deal younger than she. I took a deep breath, pushed back my hair, and marched into the shadows of Carfax Close.</p><p>It was a longish, winding close, and the printshop was at the foot. There were thriving businesses and tenements on either side, but I had no attention to spare for anything beyond the neat white sign that hung by the door.</p><p>A.

I shoved open the door and walked in.</p><p>There was a broad counter across the front of the room, with an open flap in it, and a rack to one side that held several trays of type. Posters and notices of all sorts were tacked up on the opposite wall; samples, no doubt.</p><p>The door into the back room was open, showing the bulky angular frame of a printing press. Bent over it, his back turned to me, was Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cIs that you, Geordie?\u201d he asked, not turning around. He was dressed in shirt and breeches, and had a small tool of some kind in his hand, with which he was doing something to the innards of the press. \u201cTook ye long enough. Did ye get the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t Geordie,\u201d I said. My voice was higher than usual. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d I said. \u201cClaire.\u201d</p><p>He straightened up very slowly. He wore his hair long; a thick tail of a deep, rich auburn sparked with copper. I had time to see that the neat ribbon that tied it back was green, and then he turned around.</p><p>He stared at me without speaking. A tremor ran down the muscular throat as he swallowed, but still he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>It was the same broad, good-humored face, dark blue eyes aslant the high, flat cheekbones of a Viking, long mouth curling at the ends as though always on the verge of smiling. The lines surrounding eyes and mouth were deeper, of course. The nose had changed just a bit. The knife-edge bridge was slightly thickened near the base by the ridge of an old, healed fracture. It made him look fiercer, I thought, but lessened that air of aloof reserve, and lent his appearance a new rough charm.</p><p>I walked through the flap in the counter, seeing nothing but that unblinking stare. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you break your nose?\u201d</p><p>The corners of the wide mouth lifted slightly.</p> <p>\u201cAbout three minutes after I last saw ye\u2014Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>There was a hesitation, almost a question in the name. There was no more than a foot between us. I reached out tentatively and touched the tiny line of the break, where the bone pressed white against the bronze of his skin.</p><p>He flinched backward as though an electric spark had arced between us, and the calm expression shattered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re real,\u201d he whispered. I had thought him pale already. Now all vestiges of color drained from his face. His eyes rolled up and he slumped to the floor in a shower of papers and oddments that had been sitting on the press\u2014he fell rather gracefully for such a large man, I thought abstractedly.</p><p>It was only a faint; his eyelids were beginning to flutter by the time I knelt beside him and loosened the stock at his throat. I had no doubts at all by now, but still I looked automatically as I pulled the heavy linen away. It was there, of course, the small triangular scar just above the collarbone, left by the knife of Captain Jonathan Randall, Esquire, of His Majesty\u2019s Eighth Dragoons.</p><p>His normal healthy color was returning. I sat cross-legged on the floor and hoisted his head onto my thigh. His hair felt thick and soft in my hand. His eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, is it?\u201d I said, smiling down at him with the same words he had used to me on the day of our wedding, holding my head in his lap, twenty-odd years before.</p><p>\u201cThat bad, and worse, Sassenach,\u201d he answered, mouth twitching with something almost a smile. He sat up abruptly, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cGod in heaven, you are real!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d I lifted my chin to look up at him. \u201cI th-thought you were dead.\u201d I had meant to speak lightly, but my voice betrayed me. The tears spilled down my cheeks, only to soak into the rough cloth of his shirt as he pulled me hard against him.</p><p>I shook so that it was some time before I realized that he was shaking, too, and for the same reason. I don\u2019t know how long we sat there on the dusty floor, crying in each other\u2019s arms with the longing of twenty years spilling down our faces.</p><p>His fingers twined hard in my hair, pulling it loose so that it tumbled down my neck. The dislodged pins cascaded over my shoulders and pinged on the floor like pellets of hail. My own fingers were clasped around his forearm, digging into the linen as though I were afraid he would disappear unless physically restrained.</p><p>As though gripped by the same fear, he suddenly grasped me by the shoulders and held me away from him, staring desperately into my face. He put his hand to my cheek, and traced the bones over and over again, oblivious to my tears and to my abundantly running nose.</p><p>I sniffed loudly, which seemed to bring him to his senses, for he let go and groped hastily in his sleeve for a handkerchief, which he used clumsily to swab first my face, then his own.</p><p>\u201cGive me that.\u201d I grabbed the erratically waving swatch of cloth and blew my nose firmly. \u201cNow you.\u201d I handed him the cloth and watched as he blew his nose with a noise like a strangled goose. I giggled, undone with emotion.</p><p>He smiled too, knuckling the tears away from his eyes, unable to stop staring at me.</p><p>Suddenly I couldn\u2019t bear not to be touching him. I lunged at him, and he got his arms up just in time to catch me. I squeezed until I could hear his ribs crack, and felt his hands roughly caressing my back as he said my name over and over.</p><p>At last I could let go, and sat back a little. He glanced down at the floor between his legs, frowning.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose something?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>He looked up and smiled, a little shyly.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I\u2019d lost hold altogether and pissed myself, but it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve just sat on the alepot.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, a pool of aromatic brown liquid was spreading slowly beneath him. With a squeak of alarm, I scrambled to my feet and helped him up. After trying vainly to assess the damage behind, he shrugged and unfastened his breeches. He pushed the tight fabric down over his haunches, then stopped and looked at me, blushing slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, feeling a rich blush stain my own cheeks. \u201cWe\u2019re married.\u201d I cast my eyes down, nonetheless, feeling a little breathless. \u201cAt least, I suppose we are.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment, then a smile curved his wide, soft mouth.</p><p>\u201cAye, we are,\u201d he said. Kicking free of the stained breeches, he stepped toward me.</p><p>I stretched out a hand toward him, as much to stop as to welcome him. I wanted more than anything to touch him again, but was unaccountably shy. After so long, how were we to start again?</p><p>He felt the constraint of mingled shyness and intimacy as well. Stopping a few inches from me, he took my hand. He hesitated for a moment, then bent his head over it, his lips barely brushing my knuckles. His fingers touched the silver ring and stopped there, holding the metal lightly between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cI never took it off,\u201d I blurted. It seemed important he should know that. He squeezed my hand lightly, but didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014\u201d He stopped and swallowed, still holding my hand. His fingers found and touched the silver ring once more. \u201cI want verra much to kiss you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMay I do that?\u201d</p><p>The tears were barely dammed. Two more welled up and overflowed; I felt them, full and round, roll down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He drew me slowly close to him, holding our linked hands just under his breast.</p><p>\u201cI havena done this for a verra long time,\u201d he said. I saw the hope and the fear dark in the blue of his eyes. I took the gift and gave it back to him.</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>His hands cupped my face with exquisite gentleness, and he set his mouth on mine.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know quite what I had been expecting. A reprise of the pounding fury that had accompanied our final parting? I had remembered that so often, lived it over in memory, helpless to change the outcome. The half-rough, timeless hours of mutual possession in the darkness of our marriage bed? I had longed for that, wakened often sweating and trembling from the memory of it.</p><p>But we were strangers now, barely touching, each seeking the way toward joining, slowly, tentatively, seeking and giving unspoken permission with our silent lips. My eyes were closed, and I knew without looking that Jamie\u2019s were, as well. We were, quite simply, afraid to look at each other.</p><p>Without raising his head, he began to stroke me lightly, feeling my bones through my clothes, familiarizing himself again with the terrain of my body. At last his hand traveled down my arm and caught my right hand. His fingers traced my hand until they found the ring again, and circled it, feeling the interlaced silver of the Highland pattern, polished with long wear, but still distinct.</p><p>His lips moved from mine, across my cheeks and eyes. I gently stroked his back, feeling through his shirt the marks I couldn\u2019t see, the remnants of old scars, like my ring, worn but still distinct.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen ye so many times,\u201d he said, his voice whispering warm in my ear. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to me so often. When I dreamed sometimes. When I lay in fever. When I was so afraid and so lonely I knew I must die. When I needed you, I would always see ye, smiling, with your hair curling up about your face. But ye never spoke. And ye never touched me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can touch you now.\u201d I reached up and drew my hand gently down his temple, his ear, the cheek and jaw that I could see. My hand went to the nape of his neck, under the clubbed bronze hair, and he raised his head at last, and cupped my face between his hands, love glowing strong in the dark blue eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDinna be afraid,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s the two of us now.\u201d</p><p>We might have gone on standing there gazing at each other indefinitely, had the shop bell over the door not rung. I let go of Jamie and looked around sharply, to see a small, wiry man with coarse dark hair standing in the door, mouth agape, holding a small parcel in one hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, there ye are, Geordie! What\u2019s kept ye?\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>Geordie said nothing, but his eyes traveled dubiously over his employer, standing bare-legged in his shirt in the middle of the shop, his breeches, shoes, and stockings discarded on the floor, and me in his arms, with my gown all crumpled and my hair coming down. Geordie\u2019s narrow face creased into a censorious frown.</p> <p>\u201cI quit,\u201d he said, in the rich tones of the West Highlands. \u201cThe printing\u2019s one thing\u2014I\u2019m wi\u2019 ye there, and ye\u2019ll no think otherwise\u2014but I\u2019m Free Church and my daddy before me and my grandsire before him. Workin\u2019 for a Papist is one thing\u2014the Pope\u2019s coin\u2019s as good as any, aye?\u2014but workin\u2019 for an immoral Papist is another. Do as ye like wi\u2019 your own soul, man, but if it\u2019s come to orgies in the shop, it\u2019s come too far, that\u2019s what I say. I quit!\u201d</p><p>He placed the package precisely in the center of the counter, spun on his heel and stalked toward the door. Outside, the Town Clock on the Tolbooth began to strike. Geordie turned in the doorway to glare accusingly at us.</p><p>\u201cAnd it not even noon yet!\u201d he said. The shop door slammed behind him.</p><p>Jamie stared after him for a moment, then sank slowly down onto the floor again, laughing so hard, the tears came to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not even noon yet!\u201d he repeated, wiping the tears off his cheeks. \u201cOh, God, Geordie!\u201d He rocked back and forth, grasping his knees with both hands.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t help laughing myself, though I was rather worried.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to cause you trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cWill he come back, do you think?\u201d</p><p>He sniffed and wiped his face carelessly on the tail of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. He lives just across the way, in Wickham Wynd. I\u2019ll go and see him in a bit, and...and explain,\u201d he said. He looked at me, realization dawning, and added, \u201cGod knows how!\u201d It looked for a minute as though he might start laughing again, but he mastered the impulse and stood up.</p><p>\u201cHave you got another pair of breeches?\u201d I asked, picking up the discarded ones and draping them across the counter to dry.</p><p>\u201cAye, I have\u2014upstairs. Wait a bit, though.\u201d He snaked a long arm into the cupboard beneath the counter, and came out with a neatly lettered notice that said GONE OUT. Attaching this to the outside of the door, and firmly bolting the inside, he turned to me.</p> <p>\u201cWill ye step upstairs wi\u2019 me?\u201d he said. He crooked an arm invitingly, eyes sparkling. \u201cIf ye dinna think it immoral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I said. The impulse to explode in laughter was just below the surface, sparkling in my blood like champagne. \u201cWe\u2019re married, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>The upstairs was divided into two rooms, one on either side of the landing, and a small privy closet just off the landing itself. The back room was plainly devoted to storage for the printing business; the door was propped open, and I could see wooden crates filled with books, towering bundles of pamphlets neatly tied with twine, barrels of alcohol and powdered ink, and a jumble of odd-looking hardware that I assumed must be spare parts for a printing press.</p><p>The front room was spare as a monk\u2019s cell. There was a chest of drawers with a pottery candlestick on it, a washstand, a stool, and a narrow cot, little more than a camp bed. I let out my breath when I saw it, only then realizing that I had been holding it. He slept alone.</p><p>A quick glance around confirmed that there was no sign of a feminine presence in the room, and my heart began to beat with a normal rhythm again. Plainly no one lived here but Jamie; he had pushed aside the curtain that blocked off a corner of the room, and the row of pegs revealed there supported no more than a couple of shirts, a coat and long waistcoat in sober gray, a gray wool cloak, and the spare pair of breeches he had come to fetch.</p><p>He had his back turned to me as he tucked in his shirt and fastened the new breeches, but I could see the self-consciousness in the tense line of his shoulders. I could feel a similar tension in the back of my own neck. Given a moment to recover from the shock of seeing each other, we were both stricken now with shyness. I saw his shoulders straighten and then he turned around to face me. The hysterical laughter had left us, and the tears, though his face still showed the marks of so much sudden feeling, and I knew mine did, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s verra fine to see ye, Claire,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI thought I never...well.\u201d He shrugged slightly, as though to ease the tightness of the linen shirt across his shoulders. He swallowed, then met my eyes directly.</p><p>\u201cThe child?\u201d he said. Everything he felt was evident on his face; urgent hope, desperate fear, and the struggle to contain both.</p> <p>I smiled at him, and put out my hand. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I had thought long and hard about what I might bring with me, should my journey through the stones succeed. Given my previous brush with accusations of witchcraft, I had been very careful. But there was one thing I had had to bring, no matter what the consequences might be if anyone saw them.</p><p>I pulled him down to sit beside me on the cot, and pulled out of my pocket the small rectangular package I had done up with such care in Boston. I undid its waterproof wrapping, and thrust its contents into his hands. \u201cThere,\u201d I said.</p><p>He took them from me, gingerly, like one handling an unknown and possibly dangerous substance. His big hands framed the photographs for a moment, holding them confined. Brianna\u2019s round newborn face was oblivious between his fingers, tiny fists curled on her blanket, slanted eyes closed in the new exhaustion of existence, her small mouth slightly open in sleep.</p><p>I looked up at his face; it was absolutely blank with shock. He held the pictures close to his chest, unmoving, wide-eyed and staring as though he had just been transfixed by a crossbow bolt through the heart\u2014as I supposed he had.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter sent you this,\u201d I said. I turned his blank face toward me and gently kissed him on the mouth. That broke the trance; he blinked and his face came to life again.</p><p>\u201cMy...she...\u201d His voice was hoarse with shock. \u201cDaughter. My daughter. She...knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does. Look at the rest.\u201d I slid the first picture from his grasp, revealing the snapshot of Brianna, uproariously festooned with the icing of her first birthday cake, a four-toothed smile of fiendish triumph on her face as she waved a new plush rabbit overhead.</p><p>Jamie made a small inarticulate sound, and his fingers loosened. I took the small stack of photographs from him and gave them back, one at a time.</p><p>Brianna at two, stubby in her snowsuit, cheeks round and flushed as apples, feathery hair wisping from under her hood.</p><p>Bree at four, hair a smooth bell-shaped gleam as she sat, one ankle propped on the opposite knee as she smiled for the photographer, proper and poised in a white pinafore.</p><p>At five, in proud possession of her first lunchbox, waiting to board the school bus to kindergarten.</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let me go with her; she wanted to go alone. She\u2019s very b-brave, not afraid of anything...\u201d I felt half-choked as I explained, displayed, pointed to the changing images that fell from his hands and slid down to the floor as he began to snatch each new picture.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d he said, at the picture of Bree at ten, sitting on the kitchen floor with her arms around Smoky, the big Newfoundland. That one was in color; her hair a brilliant shimmer against the dog\u2019s shiny black coat.</p><p>His hands were shaking so badly that he couldn\u2019t hold the pictures anymore; I had to show him the last few\u2014Bree full-grown, laughing at a string of fish she\u2019d caught; standing at a window in secretive contemplation; red-faced and tousled, leaning on the handle of the ax she had been using to split kindling. These showed her face in all the moods I could capture, always that face, long-nosed and wide-mouthed, with those high, broad, flat Viking cheekbones and slanted eyes\u2014a finer-boned, more delicate version of her father\u2019s, of the man who sat on the cot beside me, mouth working wordlessly, and the tears running soundless down his own cheeks.</p><p>He splayed a hand out over the photographs, trembling fingers not quite touching the shiny surfaces, and then he turned and leaned toward me, slowly, with the improbable grace of a tall tree falling. He buried his face in my shoulder and went very quietly and thoroughly to pieces.</p><p>I held him to my breast, arms tight around the broad, shaking shoulders, and my own tears fell on his hair, making small dark patches in the ruddy waves. I pressed my cheek against the top of his head, and murmured small incoherent things to him as though he were Brianna. I thought to myself that perhaps it was like surgery\u2014even when an operation is done to repair existing damage, the healing still is painful.</p><p>\u201cHer name?\u201d He raised his face at last, wiping his nose on the back of his hand. He picked up the pictures again, gently, as though they might disintegrate at his touch. \u201cWhat did ye name her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d I said proudly.</p><p>\u201cBrianna?\u201d he said, frowning at the pictures. \u201cWhat an awful name for a wee lassie!\u201d</p><p>I started back as though struck. \u201cIt is not awful!\u201d I snapped. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful name, and besides you told me to name her that! What do you mean, it\u2019s an awful name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told ye to name her that?\u201d He blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly did! When we\u2014when we\u2014the last time I saw you.\u201d I pressed my lips tightly together so I wouldn\u2019t cry again. After a moment, I had mastered my feelings enough to add, \u201cYou told me to name the baby for your father. His name was Brian, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it was.\u201d A smile seemed to be struggling for dominance of the other emotions on his face. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, you\u2019re right, I did. It\u2019s only\u2014well, I thought it would be a boy, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sorry she wasn\u2019t?\u201d I glared at him, and began snatching up the scattered photographs. His hands on my arms stopped me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sorry. Of course not!\u201d His mouth twitched slightly. \u201cBut I willna deny she\u2019s the hell of a shock, Sassenach. So are you.\u201d</p><p>I sat still for a moment, looking at him. I had had months to prepare myself for this, and still my knees felt weak and my stomach was clenched in knots. He had been taken completely unawares by my appearance; little wonder if he was reeling a bit under the impact.</p><p>\u201cI expect I am. Are you sorry I came?\u201d I asked. I swallowed. \u201cDo\u2014do you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>His hands clamped my arms so tightly that I let out a small yelp. Realizing that he was hurting me, he loosened his grip, but kept a firm hold nonetheless. His face had gone quite pale at the suggestion. He took a deep breath and let it out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, with an approximation of calmness. \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2014\u201d He broke off abruptly, jaw clamped. \u201cNo,\u201d he said again, very definitely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand slid down to take hold of mine, and with the other he reached down to pick up the photographs. He laid them on his knee, looking at them with head bent, so I couldn\u2019t see his face.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYe say it wrong, Sassenach. Her name is Brianna.\u201d He said it with an odd Highland lilt, so that the first syllable was accented, the second barely pronounced. Breeanah.</p><p>\u201cBreeanah?\u201d I said, amused. He nodded, eyes still fixed on the pictures.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlad you like it,\u201d I said.</p><p>He glanced up then, and met my eyes, with a smile hidden in the corner of his long mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell me about her.\u201d One forefinger traced the pudgy features of the baby in the snowsuit. \u201cWhat was she like as a wee lassie? What did she first say, when she learned to speak?\u201d</p><p>His hand drew me closer, and I nestled close to him. He was big, and solid, and smelled of clean linen and ink, with a warm male scent that was as exciting to me as it was familiar.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dog,\u2019\u201d I said. \u201cThat was her first word. The second one was \u2018No!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The smile widened across his face. \u201cAye, they all learn that one fast. She\u2019ll like dogs, then?\u201d He fanned the pictures out like cards, searching out the one with Smoky. \u201cThat\u2019s a lovely dog with her there. What sort is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Newfoundland.\u201d I bent forward to thumb through the pictures. \u201cThere\u2019s another one here with a puppy a friend of mine gave her...\u201d</p><p>The dim gray daylight had begun to fade, and the rain had been pattering on the roof for some time, before our talk was interrupted by a fierce subterranean growl emanating from below the lace-trimmed bodice of my Jessica Gutenburg. It had been a long time since the peanut butter sandwich.</p><p>\u201cHungry, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie asked, rather unnecessarily, I thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, now that you mention it. Do you still keep food in the top drawer?\u201d When we were first married, I had developed the habit of keeping small bits of food on hand, to supply his constant appetite, and the top drawer of any chest of drawers where we lived generally provided a selection of rolls, small cakes, or bits of cheese.</p><p>He laughed and stretched. \u201cAye, I do. There\u2019s no much there just now, though, but a couple of stale bannocks. Better I take ye down to the tavern, and\u2014\u201d The look of happiness engendered by perusing the photographs of Brianna faded, to be replaced by a look of alarm. He glanced quickly at the window, where a soft purplish color was beginning to replace the pale gray, and the look of alarm deepened.</p> <p>\u201cThe tavern! Christ! I\u2019ve forgotten Mr. Willoughby!\u201d He was on his feet and groping in the chest for fresh stockings before I could say anything. Coming out with the stockings in one hand and two bannocks in the other, he tossed the latter into my lap and sat down on the stool, hastily yanking on the former.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Willoughby?\u201d I bit into a bannock, scattering crumbs.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, more to himself than me, \u201cI said I\u2019d come for him at noon, but it went out o\u2019 my head entirely! It must be four o\u2019clock by now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is; I heard the clock strike a little while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d he repeated. Thrusting his feet into a pair of pewter-buckled shoes, he rose, snatched his coat from the peg, and then paused at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come wi\u2019 me?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>I licked my fingers and rose, pulling my cloak around me.</p><p>\u201cWild horses couldn\u2019t stop me,\u201d I assured him.</p> <p>25</p><p>HOUSE OF JOY</p><p>\u201cWho is Mr. Willoughby?\u201d I inquired, as we paused under the arch of Carfax Close to peer out at the cobbled street. \u201cEr...he\u2019s an associate of mine,\u201d Jamie replied, with a wary glance at me. \u201cBest put up your hood, it\u2019s pouring.\u201d</p><p>It was in fact raining quite hard; sheets of water fell from the arch overhead and gurgled down the gutters, cleansing the streets of sewage and rubbish. I took a deep breath of the damp, clean air, feeling exhilarated by the wildness of the evening and the closeness of Jamie, tall and powerful by my side. I had found him. I had found him, and whatever unknowns life now held, they didn\u2019t seem to matter. I felt reckless and indestructible.</p><p>I took his hand and squeezed it; he looked down and smiled at me, squeezing back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo The World\u2019s End.\u201d The roar of the water made conversation difficult. Without further speech, Jamie took me by the elbow to help me across the cobbles, and we plunged down the steep incline of the Royal Mile.</p><p>Luckily, the tavern called The World\u2019s End was no more than a hundred yards away; hard as the rain was, the shoulders of my cloak were scarcely more than dampened when we ducked beneath the low lintel and into the narrow entry-hall.</p><p>The main room was crowded, warm and smoky, a snug refuge from the storm outside. There were a few women seated on the benches that ran along the walls, but most of the patrons were men. Here and there was a man in the well-kept dress of a merchant, but most men with homes to go to were in them at this hour; the tavern hosted a mix of soldiers, wharf rats, laborers and apprentices, with here and there the odd drunkard for variety.</p><p>Heads looked up at our appearance, and there were shouts of greeting, and a general shuffling and pushing, to make room at one of the long tables. Clearly Jamie was well-known in The World\u2019s End. A few curious glances came my way, but no one said anything. I kept my cloak pulled close around me, and followed Jamie through the crush of the tavern.</p><p>\u201cNay, mistress, we\u2019ll no be stayin\u2019,\u201d he said to the young barmaid who bustled forward with an eager smile. \u201cI\u2019ve only come for himself.\u201d</p><p>The girl rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, aye, and no before time, either! Mither\u2019s put him doon the stair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m late,\u201d Jamie said apologetically. \u201cI had...business that kept me.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked curiously at me, but then shrugged and dimpled at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s no trouble, sir. Harry took him doon a stoup of brandy, and we\u2019ve heard little more of him since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandy, eh?\u201d Jamie sounded resigned. \u201cStill awake, is he?\u201d He reached into the pocket of his coat and brought out a small leather pouch, from which he extracted several coins, which he dropped into the girl\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>\u201cI expect so,\u201d she said cheerfully, pocketing the money. \u201cI heard him singin\u2019 a whiles since. Thankee, sir!\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Jamie ducked under the lintel at the back of the room, motioning me to follow. A tiny, barrel-ceilinged kitchen lay behind the main taproom, with a huge kettle of what looked like oyster stew simmering in the hearth. It smelled delicious, and I could feel my mouth starting to water at the rich aroma. I hoped we could do our business with Mr. Willoughby over supper.</p><p>A fat woman in a grimy bodice and skirt knelt by the hearth, stuffing billets of wood into the fire. She glanced up at Jamie and nodded, but made no move to get up.</p><p>He lifted a hand in response, and headed for a small wooden door in the corner. He lifted the bolt and swung the door open to reveal a dark stairway leading down, apparently into the bowels of the earth. A light flickered somewhere far below, as though elves were mining diamonds beneath the tavern.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s shoulders filled the narrow stairwell, obstructing my view of whatever lay below us. When he stepped out into the open space below, I could see heavy oak rafters, and a row of huge casks, standing on a long plank set on hurdles against the stone wall.</p><p>Only a single torch burned at the foot of the stair. The cellar was shadowy, and its cavelike depths seemed quite deserted. I listened, but didn\u2019t hear anything but the muffled racket of the tavern upstairs. Certainly no singing.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s down here?\u201d I bent to peer beneath the row of casks, wondering whether perhaps the bibulous Mr. Willoughby had been overcome with an excess of brandy and sought some secluded spot to sleep it off.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Jamie sounded grim, but resigned. \u201cThe wee bugger\u2019s hiding, I expect. He knows I dinna like it when he drinks in public houses.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow at this, but he merely strode into the shadows, muttering under his breath. The cellar stretched some way, and I could hear him, shuffling cautiously in the dark, long after I lost sight of him. Left in the circle of torchlight near the stairs, I looked around with interest.</p><p>Besides the row of casks, there were a number of wooden crates stacked near the center of the room, against an odd little chunk of wall that stood by itself, rising some five feet out of the cellar floor, running back into the darkness.</p><p>I had heard of this feature of the tavern when we had stayed in Edinburgh twenty years before with His Highness Prince Charles, but what with one thing and another, I had never actually seen it before. It was the remnant of a wall constructed by the city fathers of Edinburgh, following the disastrous Battle of Flodden Field in 1513. Concluding\u2014with some justice\u2014that no good was likely to come of association with the English to the south, they had built a wall defining both the city limits and the limit of the civilized world of Scotland. Hence \u201cThe World\u2019s End,\u201d and the name had stuck through several versions of the tavern that had eventually been built upon the remnants of the old Scots\u2019 wishful thinking.</p><p>\u201cDamned little bugger.\u201d Jamie emerged from the shadows, a cobweb stuck in his hair, and a frown on his face. \u201cHe must be back of the wall.\u201d</p><p>Turning, he put his hands to his mouth and shouted something. It sounded like incomprehensible gibberish\u2014not even like Gaelic. I dug a finger dubiously into one ear, wondering whether the trip through the stones had deranged my hearing.</p><p>A sudden movement caught the corner of my eye, causing me to look up, just in time to see a ball of brilliant blue fly off the top of the ancient wall and smack Jamie squarely between the shoulderblades.</p><p>He hit the cellar floor with a frightful thump, and I dashed toward his fallen body.</p><p>\u201cJamie! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>The prone figure made a number of coarse remarks in Gaelic and sat up slowly, rubbing his forehead, which had struck the stone floor a glancing blow. The blue ball, meanwhile, had resolved itself into the figure of a very small Chinese, who was giggling in unhinged delight, sallow round face shining with glee and brandy.</p><p>\u201cMr. Willoughby, I presume?\u201d I said to this apparition, keeping a wary eye out for further tricks.</p><p>He appeared to recognize his name, for he grinned and nodded madly at me, his eyes creased to gleaming slits. He pointed to himself, said something in Chinese, and then sprang into the air and executed several backflips in rapid succession, bobbing up on his feet in beaming triumph at the end.</p><p>\u201cBloody flea.\u201d Jamie got up, wiping the skinned palms of his hands gingerly on his coat. With a quick snatch, he caught hold of the Chinaman\u2019s collar and jerked him off his feet.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, parking the little man on the stairway and prodding him firmly in the back. \u201cWe need to be going, and quick now.\u201d In response, the little blue-clad figure promptly sagged into limpness, looking like a bag of laundry resting on the step. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right when he\u2019s sober,\u201d Jamie explained apologetically to me, as he hoisted the Chinese over one shoulder. \u201cBut he really shouldna drink brandy. He\u2019s a terrible sot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see. Where on earth did you get him?\u201d Fascinated, I followed Jamie up the stairs, watching Mr. Willoughby\u2019s pigtail swing back and forth like a metronome across the felted gray wool of Jamie\u2019s cloak.</p><p>\u201cOn the docks.\u201d But before he could explain further, the door above opened, and we were back in the tavern\u2019s kitchen. The stout proprietor saw us emerge, and came toward us, her fat cheeks puffed with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cNow, Mr. Malcolm,\u201d she began, frowning, \u201cye ken verra weel as you\u2019re welcome here, and ye\u2019ll ken as weel that I\u2019m no a fussy woman, such not bein\u2019 a convenient attitude when maintainin\u2019 a public hoose. But I\u2019ve telt ye before, yon wee yellow mannie is no\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, ye\u2019ve mentioned it, Mrs. Patterson,\u201d Jamie interrupted. He dug in his pocket and came up with a coin, which he handed to the stout publican with a bow. \u201cAnd your forbearance is much appreciated. It willna happen again. I hope,\u201d he added under his breath. He placed his hat on his head, bowed again to Mrs. Patterson, and ducked under the low lintel into the main tavern.</p><p>Our reentry caused another stir, but a negative one this time. People fell silent, or muttered half-heard curses under their breath. I gathered that Mr. Willoughby was perhaps not this local\u2019s most popular patron.</p><p>Jamie edged his way through the crowd, which gave way reluctantly. I followed as best I could, trying not to meet anyone\u2019s eyes, and trying not to breathe. Unused as I was to the unhygienic miasma of the eighteenth century, the stench of so many unwashed bodies in a small space was nearly overwhelming.</p><p>Near the door, though, we met trouble, in the person of a buxom young woman whose dress was a notch above the sober drab of the landlady and her daughter. Her neckline was a notch lower, and I hadn\u2019t much trouble in guessing her principal occupation. Absorbed in flirtatious conversation with a couple of apprentice lads when we emerged from the kitchen, she looked up as we passed, and sprang to her feet with a piercing scream, knocking over a cup of ale in the process.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d she screeched, pointing a wavering finger at Jamie. \u201cThe foul fiend!\u201d Her eyes seemed to have trouble focusing; I gathered that the spilled ale wasn\u2019t her first of the evening, early as it was.</p> <p>Her companions stared at Jamie with interest, the more so when the young lady advanced, stabbing her finger in the air like one leading a chorus. \u201cHim! The wee poolie I telt ye of\u2014him that did the disgustin\u2019 thing to me!\u201d</p><p>I joined the rest of the crowd in looking at Jamie with interest, but quickly realized, as did they, that the young woman was not talking to him, but rather to his burden.</p><p>\u201cYe neffit qurd!\u201d she yelled, addressing her remarks to the seat of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s blue-silk trousers. \u201cHiddie-pyke! Slug!\u201d</p><p>This spectacle of maidenly distress was rousing her companions; one, a tall, burly lad, stood up, fists clenched, and leaned on the table, eyes gleaming with ale and aggro.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019him, aye? Shall I knivvle him for ye, Maggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna try, laddie,\u201d Jamie advised him shortly, shifting his burden for better balance. \u201cDrink your drink, and we\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, aye? And you\u2019re the little ked\u2019s pimpmaster, are ye?\u201d The lad sneered unbecomingly, his flushed face turning in my direction. \u201cAt least your other whore\u2019s no yellow\u2014le\u2019s ha\u2019 a look at her.\u201d He flung out a paw and grabbed the edge of my cloak, revealing the low bodice of the Jessica Gutenburg.</p><p>\u201cLooks pink enough to me,\u201d said his friend, with obvious approval. \u201cIs she like it all over?\u201d Before I could move, he snatched at the bodice, catching the edge of the lace. Not designed for the rigors of eighteenth-century life, the flimsy fabric ripped halfway down the side, exposing quite a lot of pink.</p><p>\u201cLeave off, ye whoreson!\u201d Jamie swung about, eyes blazing, free fist doubled in threat.</p><p>\u201cWho ye miscallin\u2019, ye skrae-shankit skoot?\u201d The first youth, unable to get out from behind the table, leapt on top of it, and launched himself at Jamie, who neatly sidestepped the lad, allowing him to crash face-first into the wall.</p><p>Jamie took one giant step toward the table, brought his fist down hard on top of the other apprentice\u2019s head, making the lad\u2019s jaw go slack, then grabbed me by the hand and dragged me out the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d he said, grunting as he shifted the Chinaman\u2019s slippery form for a better grip. \u201cThey\u2019ll be after us any moment!\u201d</p><p>They were; I could hear the shouting as the more boisterous elements poured out of the tavern into the street behind us. Jamie took the first opening off the Royal Mile, into a narrow, dark wynd, and we splashed through mud and unidentifiable slops, ducked through an archway, and down another twisting alleyway that seemed to lead through the bowels of Edinburgh. Dark walls flashed past, and splintered wooden doors, and then we were round a corner, in a small courtyard, where we paused for breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat...on earth...did he do?\u201d I gasped. I couldn\u2019t imagine what the little Chinese could have done to a strapping young wench like the recent Maggie. From all appearances, she could have squashed him like a fly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s the feet, ye ken,\u201d Jamie explained, with a glance of resigned irritation at Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>\u201cFeet?\u201d I glanced involuntarily at the tiny Chinese man\u2019s feet, neat miniatures shod in felt-soled black satin.</p><p>\u201cNot his,\u201d Jamie said, catching my glance. \u201cThe women\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat women?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, so far it\u2019s only been whores,\u201d he said, glancing through the archway in search of pursuit, \u201cbut ye canna tell what he may try. No judgment,\u201d he explained briefly. \u201cHe\u2019s a heathen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said, though so far, I didn\u2019t. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere they are!\u201d A shout at the far end of the alley interrupted my question.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I thought they\u2019d give it up. Come on, this way!\u201d</p><p>We were off once more, down an alley, back onto the Royal Mile, a few steps down the hill, and back into a close. I could hear shouts and cries behind us on the main street, but Jamie grasped my arm and jerked me after him through an open doorway, into a yard full of casks, bundles, and crates. He looked frantically about, then heaved Mr. Willoughby\u2019s limp body into a large barrel filled with rubbish. Pausing only long enough to drop a piece of canvas on the Chinese\u2019s head for concealment, he dragged me behind a wagon loaded with crates, and pulled me down beside him.</p><p>I was gasping from the unaccustomed exertion, and my heart was racing from the adrenaline of fear. Jamie\u2019s face was flushed with cold and exercise, and his hair was sticking up in several directions, but he was scarcely breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cDo you do this sort of thing all the time?\u201d I asked, pressing a hand to my bosom in a vain effort to make my heart slow down.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said, peering warily over the top of the wagon in search of pursuit.</p><p>The echo of pounding feet came faintly, then disappeared, and everything was quiet, save for the patter of rain on the boxes above us.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone past. We\u2019d best stay here a bit, to make sure, though.\u201d He lifted down a crate for me to sit on, procured another for himself, and sat down sighing, pushing the loose hair out of his face with one hand.</p><p>He gave me a lopsided smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sassenach. I didna think it would be quite so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventful?\u201d I finished for him. I smiled back and pulled out a handkerchief to wipe a drop of moisture from the end of my nose. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d I glanced at the large barrel, where stirrings and rustlings indicated that Mr. Willoughby was returning to a more or less conscious state. \u201cEr...how do you know about the feet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me; he\u2019s a taste for the drink, ye ken,\u201d he explained, with a glance at the barrel where his colleague lay concealed. \u201cAnd when he\u2019s taken a drop too much, he starts talkin\u2019 about women\u2019s feet, and all the horrible things he wants to do wi\u2019 them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of horrible things can you do with a foot?\u201d I was fascinated. \u201cSurely the possibilities are limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they aren\u2019t,\u201d Jamie said grimly. \u201cBut it isna something I want to be talking about in the public street.\u201d</p><p>A faint singsong came from the depths of the barrel behind us. It was hard to tell, amid the natural inflections of the language, but I thought Mr. Willoughby was asking a question of some sort.</p><p>\u201cShut up, ye wee poutworm,\u201d Jamie said rudely. \u201cAnother word, and I\u2019ll walk on your damn face myself; see how ye like that.\u201d There was a high-pitched giggle, and the barrel fell silent.</p><p>\u201cHe wants someone to walk on his face?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAye. You,\u201d Jamie said briefly. He shrugged apologetically, and his cheeks flushed a deeper red. \u201cI hadna time to tell him who ye were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he speak English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, in a way, but not many people understand him when he does. I mostly talk to him in Chinee.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cYou speak Chinese?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, tilting his head with a faint smile. \u201cWell, I speak Chinee about as well as Mr. Willoughby speaks English, but then, he hasna got all that much choice in who he talks to, so he puts up wi\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>My heart showed signs of returning to normal, and I leaned back against the wagon bed, my hood farther forward against the drizzle.</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth did he get a name like Willoughby?\u201d I asked. While I was curious about the Chinese, I was even more curious about what a respectable Edinburgh printer was doing with one, but I felt a certain hesitance in prying into Jamie\u2019s life. Freshly returned from the supposed dead\u2014or its equivalent\u2014I could hardly demand to know all the details of his life on the spot.</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand across his nose. \u201cAye, well. It\u2019s only that his real name\u2019s Yi Tien Cho. He says it means \u2018Leans against heaven.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo hard for the local Scots to pronounce?\u201d Knowing the insular nature of most Scots, I wasn\u2019t surprised that they were disinclined to venture into strange linguistic waters. Jamie, with his gift for tongues, was a genetic anomaly.</p><p>He smiled, teeth a white gleam in the gathering darkness. \u201cWell, it\u2019s no that, so much. It\u2019s only, if ye say his name just a wee bit off, like, it sounds verra much like a coarse word in Gaelic. I thought Willoughby would maybe do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I thought perhaps under the circumstances, I shouldn\u2019t ask just what the indelicate Gaelic word was. I glanced over my shoulder, but the coast seemed clear.</p><p>Jamie caught the gesture and rose, nodding. \u201cAye, we can go now; the lads will ha\u2019 gone back to the tavern by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t we have to pass by The World\u2019s End on the way back to the printshop?\u201d I asked dubiously. \u201cOr is there a back way?\u201d It was full dark by now, and the thought of stumbling through the middens and muddy back passages of Edinburgh was unappealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh...no. We willna be going to the printshop.\u201d I couldn\u2019t see his face, but there seemed a certain reserve in his manner. Perhaps he had a residence somewhere else in the city? I felt a certain hollowness at the prospect; the room above the printshop was very clearly a monk\u2019s cell; but perhaps he had an entire house somewhere else\u2014with a family in it? There had been no time for any but the most essential exchange of information at the printshop. I had no way of knowing what he had done over the last twenty years, or what he might now be doing.</p><p>Still, he had plainly been glad\u2014to say the least\u2014to see me, and the air of frowning consideration he now bore might well have to do with his inebriated associate, rather than with me.</p><p>He bent over the barrel, saying something in Scots-accented Chinese. This was one of the odder sounds I had ever heard; rather like the squeaks of a bagpipe tuning up, I thought, vastly entertained by the performance.</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d said, Mr. Willoughby replied to it volubly, interrupting himself with giggles and snorts. At last, the little Chinese climbed out of the barrel, his diminutive figure silhouetted by the light of a distant lantern in the alleyway. He sprang down with fair agility and promptly prostrated himself on the ground before me.</p> <p>Bearing in mind what Jamie had told me about the feet, I took a quick step back, but Jamie laid a reassuring hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cNay, it\u2019s all right, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s only makin\u2019 amends for his disrespect to ye earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d I looked dubiously at Mr. Willoughby, who was gabbling something to the ground under his face. At a loss for the proper etiquette, I stooped down and patted him on the head. Evidently that was all right, for he leapt to his feet and bowed to me several times, until Jamie told him impatiently to stop, and we made our way back to the Royal Mile.</p><p>The building Jamie led us to was discreetly hidden down a small close just above the Kirk of the Canongate, perhaps a quarter-mile above Holyrood Palace. I saw the lanterns mounted by the gates of the palace below, and shivered slightly at the sight. We had lived with Charles Stuart in the palace for nearly five weeks, in the early, victorious phase of his short career. Jamie\u2019s uncle, Colum MacKenzie, had died there.</p><p>The door opened to Jamie\u2019s knock, and all thoughts of the past vanished. The woman who stood peering out at us, candle in hand, was petite, dark-haired and elegant. Seeing Jamie, she drew him in with a glad cry, and kissed his cheek in greeting. My insides squeezed tight as a fist, but then relaxed again, as I heard him greet her as \u201cMadame Jeanne.\u201d Not what one would call a wife\u2014nor yet, I hoped, a mistress.</p> <p>Still, there was something about the woman that made me uneasy. She was clearly French, though she spoke English well\u2014not so odd; Edinburgh was a seaport, and a fairly cosmopolitan city. She was dressed soberly, but richly, in heavy silk cut with a flair, but she wore a good deal more rouge and powder than the average Scotswoman. What disturbed me was the way she was looking at me\u2014frowning, with a palpable air of distaste.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Fraser,\u201d she said, touching Jamie on the shoulder with a possessive air that I didn\u2019t like at all, \u201cif I might have a word in private with you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie, handing his cloak to the maid who came to fetch it, took a quick look at me, and read the situation at once.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Madame Jeanne,\u201d he said courteously, reaching out a hand to draw me forward. \u201cBut first\u2014allow me to introduce my wife, Madame Fraser.\u201d</p><p>My heart stopped beating for a moment, then resumed, with a force that I was sure was audible to everyone in the small entry hall. Jamie\u2019s eyes met mine, and he smiled, the grip of his fingers tightening on my arm.</p><p>\u201cYour...wife?\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell whether astonishment or horror was more pronounced on Madame Jeanne\u2019s face. \u201cBut Monsieur Fraser...you bring her here? I thought...a woman...well enough, but to insult our own jeune filles is not good...but then...a wife...\u201d Her mouth hung open unbecomingly, displaying several decayed molars. Then she shook herself suddenly back into an attitude of flustered poise, and inclined her head to me with an attempt at graciousness. \u201cBonsoir...Madame.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLikewise, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I said politely.</p><p>\u201cIs my room ready, Madame?\u201d Jamie said. Without waiting for an answer, he turned toward the stair, taking me with him. \u201cWe shall be spending the night.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at Mr. Willoughby, who had come in with us. He had sat down at once on the floor, where he sat dripping rain, a dreamy expression on his small, flat face.</p><p>\u201cEr...?\u201d Jamie made a small questioning motion toward Mr. Willoughby, his eyebrows raised at Madame Jeanne. She stared at the little Chinese for a moment as though wondering where he had come from, then, returned to herself, clapped her hands briskly for the maid.</p><p>\u201cSee if Mademoiselle Josie is at liberty, if you please, Pauline,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then fetch up hot water and fresh towels for Monsieur Fraser and his...wife.\u201d She spoke the word with a sort of stunned amazement, as though she still didn\u2019t quite believe it.</p><p>\u201cOh, and one more thing, if you would be so kind, Madame?\u201d Jamie leaned over the banister, smiling down at her. \u201cMy wife will require a fresh gown; she has had an unfortunate accident to her wardrobe. If you could provide something suitable by morning? Thank you, Madame Jeanne. Bonsoir!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t speak, as I followed him up four flights of winding stairs to the top of the house. I was much too busy thinking, my mind in a whirl. \u201cPimpmaster,\u201d the lad in the pub had called him. But surely that was only an epithet\u2014such a thing was absolutely impossible. For the Jamie Fraser I had known, it was impossible, I corrected myself, looking up at the broad shoulders under the dark gray serge coat. But for this man?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know quite what I had been expecting, but the room was quite ordinary, small and clean\u2014though that was extraordinary, come to think of it\u2014furnished with a stool, a simple bed and chest of drawers, upon which stood a basin and ewer and a clay candlestick with a beeswax candle, which Jamie lighted from the taper he had carried up.</p> <p>He shucked off his wet coat and draped it carelessly on the stool, then sat down on the bed to remove his wet shoes.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m starving. I hope the cook\u2019s not gone to bed yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie...\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cTake off your cloak, Sassenach,\u201d he said, noticing me still standing against the door. \u201cYou\u2019re soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well...yes.\u201d I swallowed, then went on. \u201cThere\u2019s just...er...Jamie, why have you got a regular room in a brothel?\u201d I burst out.</p><p>He rubbed his chin, looking mildly embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it wasna right to bring ye here, but it was the only place I could think of where we might get your dress mended at short notice, besides finding a hot supper. And then I had to put Mr. Willoughby where he wouldna get in more trouble, and as we had to come here anyway...well\u201d\u2014he glanced at the bed\u2014\u201cit\u2019s a good deal more comfortable than my cot at the printshop. But perhaps it was a poor idea. We can leave, if ye feel it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind about that,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cThe question is\u2014why have you got a room in a brothel? Are you such a good customer that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA customer?\u201d He stared up at me, eyebrows raised. \u201cHere? God, Sassenach, what d\u2019ye think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking. Are you going to answer my question?\u201d</p><p>He stared at his stockinged feet for a moment, wiggling his toes on the floorboard. At last he looked up at me, and answered calmly, \u201cI suppose so. I\u2019m not a customer of Jeanne\u2019s, but she\u2019s a customer of mine\u2014and a good one. She keeps a room for me because I\u2019m often abroad late on business, and I\u2019d as soon have a place I can come to where I can have food and a bed at any hour, and privacy. The room is part of my arrangement with her.\u201d</p><p>I had been holding my breath. Now I let out about half of it. \u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cThen I suppose the next question is, what business has the owner of a brothel got with a printer?\u201d The absurd thought that perhaps he printed advertising circulars for Madame Jeanne flitted through my brain, to be instantly dismissed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cNo. I dinna think that\u2019s the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d With one fluid move, he was off the bed and standing in front of me, close enough for me to have to look up into his face. I had a sudden urge to take a step backward, but didn\u2019t, largely because there wasn\u2019t room.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, Sassenach, why have ye come back?\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of a question to ask me!\u201d My palms pressed flat against the rough wood of the door. \u201cWhy do you think I came back, damn you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken.\u201d The soft Scottish voice was cool, but even in the dim light, I could see the pulse throbbing in the open throat of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDid ye come to be my wife again? Or only to bring me word of my daughter?\u201d As though he sensed that his nearness unnerved me, he turned away suddenly, moving toward the window, where the shutters creaked in the wind.</p><p>\u201cYou are the mother of my child\u2014for that alone, I owe ye my soul\u2014for the knowledge that my life hasna been in vain\u2014that my child is safe.\u201d He turned again to face me, blue eyes intent.</p><p>\u201cBut it has been a time, Sassenach, since you and I were one. You\u2019ll have had your life\u2014then\u2014and I have had mine here. You\u2019ll know nothing of what I\u2019ve done, or been. Did ye come now because ye wanted to\u2014or because ye felt ye must?\u201d</p><p>My throat felt tight, but I met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI came now because before...I thought you were dead. I thought you\u2019d died at Culloden.\u201d</p><p>His eyes dropped to the windowsill, where he picked at a splinter.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWell...I meant to be dead.\u201d He smiled, without humor, eyes intent on the splinter. \u201cI tried hard enough.\u201d He looked up at me again.</p><p>\u201cHow did ye find out I hadna died? Or where I was, come to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had help. A young historian named Roger Wakefield found the records; he tracked you to Edinburgh. And when I saw \u2018A. Malcolm,\u2019 I knew...I thought...it might be you,\u201d I ended lamely. Time enough for the details later.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see. And then ye came. But still...why?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him without speaking for a moment. As though he felt the need of air, or perhaps only for something to do, he fumbled with the latch of the shutters and thrust them halfway open, flooding the room with the sound of rushing water, and the cold, fresh smell of rain.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me you don\u2019t want me to stay?\u201d I said, finally. \u201cBecause if so...I mean, I know you\u2019ll have a life now...maybe you have...other ties...\u201d With unnaturally acute senses, I could hear the small sounds of activity throughout the house below, even above the rush of the storm, and the pounding of my own heart. My palms were damp, and I wiped them surreptitiously against my skirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned from the window to stare at me.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d he said. \u201cNot want ye?\u201d His face was pale now, and his eyes unnaturally bright.</p><p>\u201cI have burned for you for twenty years, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cDo ye not know that? Jesus!\u201d The breeze stirred the loose wisps of hair around his face, and he brushed them back impatiently.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m no the man ye knew, twenty years past, am I?\u201d He turned away, with a gesture of frustration. \u201cWe know each other now less than we did when we wed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d The blood was pounding thickly in my ears.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He swung quickly toward me, and gripped my shoulder tightly, making me pull back involuntarily. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, more quietly. \u201cI dinna want ye to go. I told ye so, and I meant it. But...I must know.\u201d He bent his head toward me, his face alive with troubled question.</p><p>\u201cDo ye want me?\u201d he whispered. \u201cSassenach, will ye take me\u2014and risk the man that I am, for the sake of the man ye knew?\u201d</p><p>I felt a great wave of relief, mingled with fear. It ran from his hand on my shoulder to the tips of my toes, weakening my joints.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot too late to ask that,\u201d I said, and reached to touch his cheek, where the rough beard was starting to show. It was soft under my fingers, like stiff plush. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve already risked everything I had. But whoever you are now, Jamie Fraser\u2014yes. Yes, I do want you.\u201d</p> <p>The light of the candle flame glowed blue in his eyes, as he held out his hands to me, and I stepped wordless into his embrace. I rested my face against his chest, marveling at the feel of him in my arms; so big, so solid and warm. Real, after the years of longing for a ghost I could not touch.</p><p>Disentangling himself after a moment, he looked down at me, and touched my cheek, very gently. He smiled slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve the devil\u2019s own courage, aye? But then, ye always did.\u201d</p><p>I tried to smile at him, but my lips trembled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? How do you know what I\u2019m like? You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been doing for the last twenty years, either. I might be a horrible person, for all you know!\u201d</p><p>The smile on his lips moved into his eyes, lighting them with humor. \u201cI suppose ye might, at that. But, d\u2019ye know, Sassenach\u2014I dinna think I care?\u201d</p> <p>I stood looking at him for another minute, then heaved a deep sigh that popped a few more stitches in my gown.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>It seemed absurd to be shy with him, but shy I was. The adventures of the evening, and his words to me, had opened up the chasm of reality\u2014those twenty unshared years that gaped between us, and the unknown future that lay beyond. Now we had come to the place where we would begin to know each other again, and discover whether we were in fact the same two who had once existed as one flesh\u2014and whether we might be one again.</p><p>A knock at the door broke the tension. It was a small servingmaid, with a tray of supper. She bobbed shyly to me, smiled at Jamie, and laid both supper\u2014cold meat, hot broth, and warm oatbread with butter\u2014and the fire with a quick and practiced hand, then left us with a murmured \u201cGood e\u2019en to ye.\u201d</p><p>We ate slowly, talking carefully only of neutral things; I told him how I had made my way from Craigh na Dun to Inverness, and made him laugh with stories of Mr. Graham and Master Georgie. He in turn told me about Mr. Willoughby; how he had found the little Chinese, half-starved and dead drunk, lying behind a row of casks on the docks at Burntisland, one of the shipping ports near Edinburgh.</p><p>We said nothing much of ourselves, but as we ate, I became increasingly conscious of his body, watching his fine, long hands as he poured wine and cut meat, seeing the twist of his powerful torso under his shirt, and the graceful line of neck and shoulder as he stooped to retrieve a fallen napkin. Once or twice, I thought I saw his gaze linger on me in the same way\u2014a sort of hesitant avidity\u2014but he quickly glanced away each time, hooding his eyes so that I could not tell what he saw or felt.</p><p>As the supper concluded, the same thought was uppermost in both our minds. It could scarcely be otherwise, considering the place in which we found ourselves. A tremor of mingled fear and anticipation shot through me.</p><p>At last, he drained his wineglass, set it down, and met my eyes directly.</p> <p>\u201cWill ye...\u201d He stopped, the flush deepening on his features, but met my eyes, swallowed once, and went on. \u201cWill ye come to bed wi\u2019 me, then? I mean,\u201d he hurried on, \u201cit\u2019s cold, and we\u2019re both damp, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there aren\u2019t any chairs,\u201d I finished for him. \u201cAll right.\u201d I pulled my hand loose from his, and turned toward the bed, feeling a queer mix of excitement and hesitance that made my breath come short.</p><p>He pulled off his breeches and stockings quickly, then glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sassenach; I should have thought ye\u2019d need help wi\u2019 your laces.\u201d</p><p>So he didn\u2019t undress women often, I thought, before I could stop myself, and my lips curved in a smile at the thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not laces,\u201d I murmured, \u201cbut if you\u2019d give a hand in the back there...\u201d I laid aside my cloak, and turned my back to him, lifting my hair to expose the neck of the dress.</p><p>There was a puzzled silence. Then I felt a finger sliding slowly down the groove of my backbone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he said, sounding startled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a zipper,\u201d I said, smiling, though he couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cSee the little tab at the top? Just take hold of that, and pull it straight down.\u201d</p><p>The zipper teeth parted with a muted ripping noise, and the remnants of Jessica Gutenburg sagged free. I pulled my arms out of the sleeves and let the dress drop heavily around my feet, turning to face Jamie before I lost my nerve.</p><p>He jerked back, startled by this sudden chrysalis-shedding. Then he blinked, and stared at me.</p><p>I stood in front of him in nothing but my shoes and gartered rose-silk stockings. I had an overwhelming urge to snatch the dress back up, but I resisted it. I stiffened my spine, raised my chin, and waited.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word. His eyes gleamed in the candlelight as he moved his head slightly, but he still had that trick of hiding all his thoughts behind an inscrutable mask.</p><p>\u201cWill you bloody say something?\u201d I demanded at last, in a voice that shook only a little.</p><p>His mouth opened, but no words came out. He shook his head slowly from side to side.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered at last. \u201cClaire...you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said with conviction, \u201care losing your eyesight. It\u2019s probably glaucoma; you\u2019re too young for cataracts.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, a little unsteadily, and then I saw that he was in fact blinded\u2014his eyes shone with moisture, even as he smiled. He blinked hard, and held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he said, with equal conviction, \u201cha\u2019 got eyes like a hawk, and always did. Come here to me.\u201d</p><p>A little reluctantly, I took his hand, and stepped out of the inadequate shelter of the remains of my dress. He drew me gently in, to stand between his knees as he sat on the bed. Then he kissed me softly, once on each breast, and laid his head between them, his breath coming warm on my bare skin.</p><p>\u201cYour breast is like ivory,\u201d he said softly, the word almost \u201cbreest\u201d in the Highland Scots that always grew broad when he was truly moved. His hand rose to cup one breast, his fingers tanned into darkness against my own pale glow.</p><p>\u201cOnly to see them, sae full and sae round\u2014Christ, I could lay my head here forever. But to touch ye, my Sassenach...you wi\u2019 your skin like white velvet, and the sweet long lines of your body...\u201d He paused, and I could feel the working of his throat muscles as he swallowed, his hand moving slowly down the curving slope of waist and hip, the swell and taper of buttock and thigh.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he said, still softly. \u201cI couldna look at ye, Sassenach, and keep my hands from you, nor have ye near me, and not want ye.\u201d He lifted his head then, and planted a kiss over my heart, then let his hand float down the gentle curve of my belly, lightly tracing the small marks left there by Brianna\u2019s birth.</p><p>\u201cYou...really don\u2019t mind?\u201d I said hesitantly, brushing my own fingers over my stomach.</p><p>He smiled up at me with something half-rueful in his expression. He hesitated for a moment, then drew up the hem of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The scar ran from midthigh nearly to his groin, an eight-inch length of twisted, whitish tissue. I couldn\u2019t repress a gasp at its appearance, and dropped to my knees beside him.</p><p>I laid my cheek on his thigh, holding tight to his leg, as though I would keep him now\u2014as I had not been able to keep him then. I could feel the slow, deep pulse of the blood through his femoral artery under my fingers\u2014a bare inch away from the ugly gully of that twisting scar.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna fright ye, nor sicken ye, Sassenach?\u201d he asked, laying a hand on my hair. I lifted my head and stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d He reached to touch my stomach, his eyes holding mine. \u201cAnd if ye bear the scars of your own battles, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly, \u201cthey dinna trouble me, either.\u201d</p><p>He lifted me to the bed beside him then, and leaned to kiss me. I kicked off my shoes, and curled my legs up, feeling the warmth of him through his shirt. My hands found the button at the throat, fumbling to open it.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s no much to see, Sassenach,\u201d he said, with an uncertain laugh. \u201cBut whatever it is, it\u2019s yours\u2014if ye want it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the shirt over his head and tossed it on the floor, then leaned back on the palms of his hands, displaying his body.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know quite what I had been expecting. In fact, the sight of his naked body took my breath away. He was still tall, of course, and beautifully made, the long bones of his body sleek with muscle, elegant with strength. He glowed in the candlelight, as though the light came from within him.</p><p>He had changed, of course, but the change was subtle; as though he had been put into an oven and baked to a hard finish. He looked as though both muscle and skin had drawn in just a bit, grown closer to the bone, so he was more tightly knit; he had never seemed gawky, but the last hint of boyish looseness had vanished.</p><p>His skin had darkened slightly, to a pale gold, burned to bronze on face and throat, paling down the length of his body to a pure white, tinged with blue veins, in the hollow of his thighs. His pubic hair stood out in a ferocious auburn bush, and it was quite obvious that he had not been lying; he did want me, and very badly.</p><p>My eyes met his, and his mouth quirked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI did say once I would be honest with ye, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, feeling tears sting my eyes at the same time, a rush of confused emotion surging up in me.</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d I reached toward him, hesitant, and he took my hand. The strength and warmth of it were startling, and I jerked slightly. Then I tightened my grasp, and he rose to his feet, facing me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stood still then, awkwardly hesitating. We were intensely aware of each other\u2014how could we not be? It was quite a small room, and the available atmosphere was completely filled with a charge like static electricity, almost strong enough to be visible. I had a feeling of empty-bellied terror, like the sort you get at the top of a roller coaster.</p><p>\u201cAre you as scared as I am?\u201d I finally said, sounding hoarse to my own ears.</p><p>He looked me over carefully, and raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think I can be,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re covered wi\u2019 gooseflesh. Are ye scairt, Sassenach, or only cold?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I said, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGet in, then,\u201d he said. He released my hand and bent to turn back the quilt.</p><p>I didn\u2019t stop shaking when he slid under the quilt beside me, though the heat of his body was a physical shock.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re not cold!\u201d I blurted. I turned toward him, and the warmth of him shimmered against my skin from head to toes. Instinctively drawn, I pressed close against him, shivering. I could feel my ni**les tight and hard against his chest, and the sudden shock of his naked skin against my own.</p><p>He laughed a little uncertainly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I suppose I must be afraid, aye?\u201d His arms came around me, gently, and I touched his chest, feeling hundreds of tiny goose bumps spring up under my fingertips, among the ruddy curling hairs.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we were afraid of each other before,\u201d I whispered, \u201con our wedding night\u2014you held my hands. You said it would be easier if we touched.\u201d</p><p>He made a small sound as my fingertip found his nipple.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did,\u201d he said, sounding breathless. \u201cLord, touch me like that again.\u201d His hands tightened suddenly, holding me against him.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he said again softly, \u201cand let me touch you, my Sassenach.\u201d His hand cupped me, stroking, touching, and my breast lay taut and heavy in his palm. I went on trembling, but now he was doing it, too.</p><p>\u201cWhen we wed,\u201d he whispered, his breath warm against my cheek, \u201cand I saw ye there, so bonny in your white dress\u2014I couldna think of anything but when we\u2019d be alone, and I could undo your laces and have ye naked, next to me in the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me now?\u201d I whispered, and kissed the sunburned flesh in the hollow above his collarbone. His skin was faintly salty to the taste, and his hair smelled of woodsmoke and pungent maleness.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer, but moved abruptly, so I felt the hardness of him, stiff against my belly.</p><p>It was terror as much as desire that pressed me close against him. I wanted him, all right; my br**sts ached and my belly was tight with it, the unaccustomed rush of arousal slippery between my legs, opening me for him. But as strong as lust, was the desire simply to be taken, to have him master me, quell my doubts in a moment of rough usage, take me hard and swiftly enough to make me forget myself.</p><p>I could feel the urge to do it tremble in the hands that cupped my bu**ocks, in the involuntary jerk of his hips, brought up short as he stopped himself.</p><p>Do it, I thought, in an agony of apprehension. For God\u2019s sake, do it now and don\u2019t be gentle!</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say it. I saw the need of it on his face, but he couldn\u2019t say it, either; it was both too soon and too late for such words between us.</p><p>But we had shared another language, and my body still recalled it. I pressed my hips against him sharply, grasping his, the curves of his bu**ocks clenched hard under my hands. I turned my face upward, urgent to be kissed, at the same moment that he bent abruptly to kiss me.</p><p>My nose hit his forehead with a sickening crunch. My eyes watered profusely as I rolled away from him, clutching my face.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrist, have I hurt ye, Claire?\u201d Blinking away the tears, I could see his face, hovering anxiously over me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said stupidly. \u201cMy nose is broken, though, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, gently feeling the bridge of my nose. \u201cWhen ye break your nose, it makes a nasty crunching sound, and ye bleed like a pig. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>I felt gingerly beneath my nostrils, but he was right; I wasn\u2019t bleeding. The pain had receded quickly, too. As I realized that, I also realized that he was lying on me, my legs sprawled wide beneath him, his c**k just touching me, no more than a hairsbreadth from the moment of decision.</p><p>I saw the realization dawn in his eyes as well. Neither of us moved, barely breathing. Then his chest swelled as he took a deep breath, reached and took both my wrists in one hand. He pulled them up, over my head, and held me there, my body arched taut and helpless under him.</p><p>\u201cGive me your mouth, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly, and bent to me. His head blotted out the candlelight, and I saw nothing but a dim glow and the darkness of his flesh as his mouth touched mine. Gently, brushing, then pressing, warm, and I opened to him with a little gasp, his tongue seeking mine.</p><p>I bit his lip, and he drew back a little, startled.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said against his lips, my own breath warm between us. \u201cJamie!\u201d That was all I could say, but my hips jerked against him, and jerked again, urging violence. I turned my head and fastened my teeth in the flesh of his shoulder.</p><p>He made a small sound deep in his throat and came into me hard. I was tight as any virgin and cried out, arching under him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d I said. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>His body heard me and answered in the same language, his grasp of my wrists tightening as he plunged hard into me, the force of it reaching my womb with each stroke.</p><p>Then he let go of my wrists and half-fell on me, the weight of him pinning me to the bed as he reached under, holding my hips hard, keeping me immobile.</p><p>I whimpered and writhed against him, and he bit my neck.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he said in my ear. I was still, only because I couldn\u2019t move. We lay pressed tight together, shuddering. I could feel the pounding against my ribs, but didn\u2019t know whether it was my heart, or his.</p><p>Then he moved in me, very slightly, a question of the flesh. It was enough; I convulsed in answer, held helpless under him, and felt the spasms of my release stroke him, stroke him, seize and release him, urging him to join me.</p><p>He reared up on both hands, back arched and head thrown back, eyes closed and breathing hard. Then very slowly, he bent his head forward and opened his eyes. He looked down at me with unutterable tenderness, and the candlelight gleamed briefly on the wetness on his cheek, maybe sweat or maybe tears.</p><p>\u201cOh, Claire,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh, God, Claire.\u201d</p><p>And his release began, deep inside me, without his moving, shivering through his body so that his arms trembled, the ruddy hairs quivering in the dim light, and he dropped his head with a sound like a sob, his hair hiding his face as he spilled himself, each jerk and pulse of his flesh between my legs rousing an echo in my own.</p><p>When it was over, he held himself over me, still as stone for a long moment. Then, very gently, he lowered himself, pressed his head against mine, and lay as if dead.</p><p>I stirred at last from a deep, contented stupor, lifting my hand to lay it over the spot where his pulse beat slow and strong, just at the base of his breastbone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like bicycle riding, I expect,\u201d I said. My head rested peacefully in the curve of his shoulder, my hand idly playing with the red-gold curls that sprang up in thickets across his chest. \u201cDid you know you\u2019ve got lots more hairs on your chest than you used to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said drowsily, \u201cI dinna usually count them. Have bye-sickles got lots of hair, then?\u201d</p><p>It caught me by surprise, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI just meant that we seemed to recall what to do all right.\u201d</p><p>Jamie opened one eye and looked down at me consideringly. \u201cIt would take a real daftie to forget that, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cI may be lacking practice, but I havena lost all my faculties yet.\u201d</p><p>We were still for a long time, aware of each other\u2019s breathing, sensitive to each small twitch and shifting of position. We fitted well together, my head curled into the hollow of his shoulder, the territory of his body warm under my hand, both strange and familiar, awaiting rediscovery.</p><p>The building was a solid one, and the sound of the storm outside drowned most noises from within, but now and then the sounds of feet or voices were dimly audible below us; a low, masculine laugh, or the higher voice of a woman, raised in professional flirtation.</p><p>Hearing it, Jamie stirred a little uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cI should maybe have taken ye to a tavern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I assured him. \u201cThough I must say, of all the places I\u2019d imagined being with you again, I somehow never thought of a brothel.\u201d I hesitated, not wanting to pry, but curiosity got the best of me. \u201cYou...er...don\u2019t own this place, do you, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a little, staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cMe? God in heaven, Sassenach, what d\u2019ye think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, do I?\u201d I pointed out, with some asperity. \u201cThe first thing you do when I find you is faint, and as soon as I\u2019ve got you back on your feet, you get me assaulted in a pub and chased through Edinburgh in company with a deviant Chinese, ending up in a brothel\u2014whose madam seems to be on awfully familiar terms with you, I might add.\u201d The tips of his ears had gone pink, and he seemed to be struggling between laughter and indignation.</p><p>\u201cYou then take off your clothes, announce that you\u2019re a terrible person with a depraved past, and take me to bed. What did you expect me to think?\u201d</p><p>Laughter won out.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m no a saint, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m no a pimp, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d I said. There was a momentary pause, and then I said, \u201cDo you mean to tell me what you are, or shall I go on running down the disreputable possibilities until I come close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d he said, entertained by this suggestion. \u201cWhat\u2019s your best guess?\u201d</p><p>I looked him over carefully. He lay at ease amid the tumbled sheets, one arm behind his head, grinning at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d bet my shift you\u2019re not a printer,\u201d I said.</p><p>The grin widened.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I poked him rudely in the ribs. \u201cYou\u2019re much too fit. Most men in their forties have begun to go soft round the middle, and you haven\u2019t a spare ounce on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mostly because I havena got anyone to cook for me,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cIf you ate in taverns all the time, ye wouldna be fat, either. Luckily, it looks as though ye eat regularly.\u201d He patted my bottom familiarly, and then ducked, laughing, as I slapped at his hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to distract me,\u201d I said, resuming my dignity. \u201cAt any rate, you didn\u2019t get muscles like that slaving over a printing press.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver tried to work one, Sassenach?\u201d He raised a derisive eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I furrowed my brow in thought. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve taken up highway robbery?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, the grin widening. \u201cGuess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbezzlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, likely not kidnapping for ransom,\u201d I said, and began to tick other possibilities off on my fingers. \u201cPetty thievery? No. Piracy? No, you couldn\u2019t possibly, unless you\u2019ve got over being seasick. Usury? Hardly.\u201d I dropped my hand and stared at him.</p> <p>\u201cYou were a traitor when I last knew you, but that scarcely seems a good way of making a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m still a traitor,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI just havena been convicted lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent several years in prison for treason, Sassenach,\u201d he said, rather grimly. \u201cFor the Rising. But that was some time back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew that.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes widened. \u201cYe knew that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and a bit more,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. But putting that all aside for the present and returning to the point at issue\u2014what do you do for a living these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a printer,\u201d he said, grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cAnd a traitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a traitor,\u201d he confirmed, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ve been arrested for sedition six times in the last two years, and had my premises seized twice, but the court wasna able to prove anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens to you if they do prove it, one of these times?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said airily, waving his free hand in the air, \u201cthe pillory. Earnailing. Flogging. Imprisonment. Transportation. That sort of thing. Likely not hanging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a relief,\u201d I said dryly. I felt a trifle hollow. I hadn\u2019t even tried to imagine what his life might be like, if I found him. Now that I had, I was a little taken aback.</p><p>\u201cI did warn ye,\u201d he said. The teasing was gone now, and the dark blue eyes were serious and watchful.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d I said, and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cDo ye want to leave now?\u201d He spoke casually enough, but I saw his fingers clench and tighten on a fold of the quilt, so that the knuckles stood out white against the sunbronzed skin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. I smiled at him, as best I could manage. \u201cI didn\u2019t come back just to make love with you once. I came to be with you\u2014if you\u2019ll have me,\u201d I ended, a little hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019ll have you!\u201d He let out the breath he had been holding, and sat up to face me, cross-legged on the bed. He reached out and took my hands, engulfing them between his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014canna even say what I felt when I touched you today, Sassenach, and knew ye to be real,\u201d he said. His eyes traveled over me, and I felt the heat of him, yearning, and my own heat, melting toward him. \u201cTo find you again\u2014and then to lose ye...\u201d He stopped, throat working as he swallowed.</p> <p>I touched his face, tracing the fine, clean line of cheekbone and jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t lose me,\u201d I said. \u201cNot ever again.\u201d I smiled, smoothing back the thick ruff of ruddy hair behind his ear. \u201cNot even if I find out you\u2019ve been committing bigamy and public drunkenness.\u201d</p><p>He jerked sharply at that, and I dropped my hand, startled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d he said, and stopped. He pursed his lips and glanced at me quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what? Is there something else you haven\u2019t told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, printing seditious pamphlets isna all that profitable,\u201d he said, in explanation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose so,\u201d I said, my heart starting to speed up again at the prospect of further revelations. \u201cWhat else have you been doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that I do a wee bit of smuggling,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cOn the side, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA smuggler?\u201d I stared. \u201cSmuggling what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whisky mostly, but rum now and then, and a fair bit of French wine and cambric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it!\u201d I said. The pieces of the puzzle all settled into place\u2014Mr. Willoughby, the Edinburgh docks, and the riddle of our present surroundings. \u201cThat\u2019s what your connection is with this place\u2014what you meant by saying Madame Jeanne is a customer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He nodded. \u201cIt works verra well; we store the liquor in one of the cellars below when it comes in from France. Some of it we sell directly to Jeanne; some she keeps for us until we can ship it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. And as part of the arrangements...\u201d I said delicately, \u201cyou, er...\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes narrowed at me.</p><p>\u201cThe answer to what you\u2019re thinking, Sassenach, is no,\u201d he said very firmly.</p><p>\u201cOh, is it?\u201d I said, feeling extremely pleased. \u201cMind reader, are you? And what am I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were wondering do I take out my price in trade sometimes, aye?\u201d He lifted one brow at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was,\u201d I admitted. \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, isn\u2019t it, then?\u201d He raised both ruddy brows and took me by both shoulders, leaning toward me.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d he said, a moment later. He sounded a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, sounding equally breathless. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Come here.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around me, and pulled me close. The body\u2019s memory is different from the mind\u2019s. When I thought, and wondered, and worried, I was clumsy and awkward, fumbling my way. Without the interference of conscious thought, my body knew him, and answered him at once in tune, as though his touch had left me moments before, and not years.</p><p>\u201cI was more afraid this time than on our wedding night,\u201d I murmured, my eyes fixed on the slow, strong pulsebeat in the hollow of his throat.</p><p>\u201cWere ye, then?\u201d His arm shifted and tightened round me. \u201cDo I frighten ye, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I put my fingers on the tiny pulse, breathing the deep musk of his effort. \u201cIt\u2019s only...the first time...I didn\u2019t think it would be forever. I meant to go, then.\u201d</p><p>He snorted faintly, the sweat gleaming lightly in the small hollow in the center of his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye did go, and came again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re here; there\u2019s no more that matters, than that.\u201d</p><p>I raised myself slightly to look at him. His eyes were closed, slanted and catlike, his lashes that striking color I remembered so well because I had seen it so often; deep auburn at the tips, fading to a red so pale as nearly to be blond at the roots.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think, the first time we lay together?\u201d I asked. The dark blue eyes opened slowly, and rested on me.</p><p>\u201cIt has always been forever, for me, Sassenach,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>Sometime later, we fell asleep entwined, with the sound of the rain falling soft against the shutters, mingling with the muffled sounds of commerce below.</p><p>It was a restless night. Too tired to stay awake a moment longer, I was too happy to fall soundly asleep. Perhaps I was afraid he would vanish if I slept. Perhaps he felt the same. We lay close together, not awake, but too aware of each other to sleep deeply. I felt every small twitch of his muscles, every movement of his breathing, and knew he was likewise aware of me.</p><p>Half-dozing, we turned and moved together, always touching, in a sleepy, slow-motion ballet, learning again in silence the language of our bodies. Somewhere in the deep, quiet hours of the night, he turned to me without a word, and I to him, and we made love to each other in a slow, unspeaking tenderness that left us lying still at last, in possession of each other\u2019s secrets.</p><p>Soft as a moth flying in the dark, my hand skimmed his leg, and found the thin deep runnel of the scar. My fingers traced its invisible length and paused, with the barest of touches at its end, wordlessly asking, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His breathing changed with a sigh, and his hand lay over mine.</p><p>\u201cCulloden,\u201d he said, the whispered word an evocation of tragedy. Death. Futility. And the terrible parting that had taken me from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never leave you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cNot again.\u201d</p><p>His head turned on the pillow, his features lost in darkness, and his lips brushed mine, light as the touch of an insect\u2019s wing. He turned onto his back, shifting me next to him, his hand resting heavy on the curve of my thigh, keeping me close.</p><p>Sometime later, I felt him shift again, and turn the bedclothes back a little way. A cool draft played across my forearm; the tiny hairs prickled upright, and then flattened beneath the warmth of his touch. I opened my eyes, to find him turned on his side, absorbed in the sight of my hand. It lay still on the quilt, a carved white thing, all the bones and tendons chalked in gray as the room began its imperceptible shift from night to day.</p><p>\u201cDraw her for me,\u201d he whispered, head bent as he gently traced the shapes of my fingers, long and ghostly beneath the darkness of his own touch.</p><p>\u201cWhat has she of you, of me? Can ye tell me? Are her hands like yours, Claire, or mine? Draw her for me, let me see her.\u201d He laid his own hand down beside my own. It was his good hand, the fingers straight and flat-jointed, the nails clipped short, square and clean.</p><p>\u201cLike mine,\u201d I said. My voice was low and hoarse with waking, barely loud enough to register above the drumming of the rain outside. The house beneath was silent. I raised the fingers of my immobile hand an inch in illustration.</p><p>\u201cShe has long, slim hands like mine\u2014but bigger than mine, broad across the backs, and a deep curve at the outside, near the wrist\u2014like that. Like yours; she has a pulse just there, where you do.\u201d I touched the spot where a vein crossed the curve of his radius, just where the wrist joins the hand. He was so still I could feel his heartbeat under my fingertip.</p><p>\u201cHer nails are like yours; square, not oval like mine. But she has the crooked little finger on her right hand that I have,\u201d I said, lifting it. \u201cMy mother had it, too; Uncle Lambert told me.\u201d My own mother had died when I was five. I had no clear memory of her, but thought of her whenever I saw my own hand unexpectedly, caught in a moment of grace like this one. I laid the hand with the crooked finger on his, then lifted it to his face.</p><p>\u201cShe has this line,\u201d I said softly, tracing the bold sweep from temple to cheek. \u201cYour eyes, exactly, and those lashes and brows. A Fraser nose. Her mouth is more like mine, with a full bottom lip, but it\u2019s wide, like yours. A pointed chin, like mine, but stronger. She\u2019s a big girl\u2014nearly six feet tall.\u201d I felt his start of astonishment, and nudged him gently, knee to knee. \u201cShe has long legs, like yours, but very feminine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has she that small blue vein just there?\u201d His hand touched my own face, thumb tender in the hollow of my temple. \u201cAnd ears like tiny wings, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always complained about her ears\u2014said they stuck out,\u201d I said, feeling the tears sting my eyes as Brianna came suddenly to life between us.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pierced. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d I said, talking fast to keep the tears at bay. \u201cFrank did; he said it looked cheap, and she shouldn\u2019t, but she wanted to do it, and I let her, when she was sixteen. Mine were; it didn\u2019t seem right to say she couldn\u2019t when I did, and her friends all did, and I didn\u2019t\u2014didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYe were right,\u201d he said, interrupting the flow of half-hysterical words. \u201cYe did fine,\u201d he repeated, softly but firmly, holding me close. \u201cYe were a wonderful mother, I know it.\u201d</p><p>I was crying again, quite soundlessly, shaking against him. He held me gently, stroking my back and murmuring. \u201cYe did well,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cYe did right.\u201d And after a little while, I stopped crying.</p><p>\u201cYe gave me a child, mo nighean donn,\u201d he said softly, into the cloud of my hair. \u201cWe are together for always. She is safe; and we will live forever now, you and I.\u201d He kissed me, very lightly, and laid his head upon the pillow next to me. \u201cBrianna,\u201d he whispered, in that odd Highland way that made her name his own. He sighed deeply, and in an instant, was asleep. In another, I fell asleep myself, my last sight his wide, sweet mouth, relaxed in sleep, half-smiling.</p><p>26</p> <p>WHORE\u2019S BRUNCH</p><p>From years of answering the twin calls of motherhood and medicine, I had developed the ability to wake from even the soundest sleep at once and completely. I woke so now, immediately aware of the worn linen sheets around me, the dripping of the eaves outside, and the warm scent of Jamie\u2019s body mingling with the cold, sweet air that breathed through the crack of the shutters above me.</p><p>Jamie himself was not in bed; without reaching out or opening my eyes, I knew that the space beside me was empty. He was close by, though. There was a sound of stealthy movement, and a faint scraping noise nearby. I turned my head on the pillow and opened my eyes.</p><p>The room was filled with a gray light that washed the color from everything, but left the pale lines of his body clear in the dimness. He stood out against the darkness of the room, solid as ivory, vivid as though he were etched upon the air. He was naked, his back turned to me as he stood in front of the chamber pot he had just pulled from its resting place beneath the washstand.</p><p>I admired the squared roundness of his bu**ocks, the small muscular hollow that dented each one, and their pale vulnerability. The groove of his backbone, springing in a deep, smooth curve from hips to shoulders. As he moved slightly, the light caught the faint silver shine of the scars on his back, and the breath caught in my throat.</p> <p>He turned around then, face calm and faintly abstracted. He saw me watching him, and looked slightly startled.</p><p>I smiled but stayed silent, unable to think of anything to say. I kept looking at him, though, and he at me, the same smile upon his lips. Without speaking, he moved toward me and sat on the bed, the mattress shifting under his weight. He laid his hand open on the quilt, and I put my own into it without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d I asked idiotically.</p><p>A grin broadened across his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I could feel the heat of him, even at this distance, in spite of the chilly room. \u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>We fell quiet again, but could not take our eyes away from each other. I looked him over carefully in the strengthening light, comparing memory to reality. A narrow blade of early sun knifed through the shutters\u2019 crack, lighting a lock of hair like polished bronze, gilding the curve of his shoulder, the smooth flat slope of his belly. He seemed slightly larger than I had remembered, and one hell of a lot more immediate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bigger than I remembered,\u201d I ventured. He tilted his head, looking down at me in amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wee bit smaller, I think.\u201d</p><p>His hand engulfed mine, fingers delicately circling the bones of my wrist. My mouth was dry; I swallowed and licked my lips.</p><p>\u201cA long time ago, you asked me if I knew what it was between us,\u201d I said.</p><p>His eyes rested on mine, so dark a blue as to be nearly black in a light like this.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d he said softly. His fingers tightened briefly on mine. \u201cWhat it is\u2014when I touch you; when ye lie wi\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didna ken either.\u201d The smile had faded a bit, but was still there, lurking in the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d and stopped to clear my throat.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s still there,\u201d he finished for me, and the smile moved from his lips, lighting his eyes. \u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>It was. I was still as aware of him as I might have been of a lighted stick of dy***ite in my immediate vicinity, but the feeling between us had changed. We had fallen asleep as one flesh, linked by the love of the child we had made, and had waked as two people\u2014bound by something different.</p><p>\u201cYes. Is it\u2014I mean, it\u2019s not just because of Brianna, do you think?\u201d</p><p>The pressure on my fingers increased.</p><p>\u201cDo I want ye because you\u2019re the mother of my child?\u201d He raised one ruddy eyebrow in incredulity. \u201cWell, no. Not that I\u2019m no grateful,\u201d he added hastily. \u201cBut\u2014no.\u201d He bent his head to look down at me intently, and the sun lit the narrow bridge of his nose and sparked in his lashes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I could watch ye for hours, Sassenach, to see how you have changed, or how ye\u2019re the same. Just to see a wee thing, like the curve of your chin\u201d\u2014he touched my jaw gently, letting his hand slide up to cup my head, thumb stroking my earlobe\u2014\u201cor your ears, and the bittie holes for your earbobs. Those are all the same, just as they were. Your hair\u2014I called ye mo nighean donn, d\u2019ye recall? My brown one.\u201d His voice was little more than a whisper, his fingers threading my curls between them.</p><p>\u201cI expect that\u2019s changed a bit,\u201d I said. I hadn\u2019t gone gray, but there were paler streaks where my normal light brown had faded to a softer gold, and here and there, the glint of a single silver strand.</p><p>\u201cLike beechwood in the rain,\u201d he said, smiling and smoothing a lock with one forefinger, \u201cand the drops coming down from the leaves across the bark.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and stroked his thigh, touching the long scar that ran down it.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could have been there to take care of you,\u201d I said softly. \u201cIt was the most horrible thing I ever did\u2014leaving you, knowing...that you meant to be killed.\u201d I could hardly bear to speak the word.</p><p>\u201cWell, I tried hard enough,\u201d he said, with a wry grimace that made me laugh, in spite of my emotion. \u201cIt wasna my fault I didna succeed.\u201d He glanced dispassionately at the long, thick scar that ran down his thigh. \u201cNot the fault of the Sassenach wi\u2019 the bayonet, either.\u201d</p><p>I heaved myself up on one elbow, squinting at the scar. \u201cA bayonet did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It festered, ye see,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cI know; we found the journal of the Lord Melton who sent you home from the battlefield. He didn\u2019t think you\u2019d make it.\u201d My hand tightened on his knee, as though to reassure myself that he was in fact here before me, alive.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWell, I damn nearly didn\u2019t. I was all but dead when they pulled me out of the wagon at Lallybroch.\u201d His face darkened with memory.</p><p>\u201cGod, sometimes I wake up in the night, dreaming of that wagon. It was two days\u2019 journey, and I was fevered or chilled, or both together. I was covered wi\u2019 hay, and the ends of it sticking in my eyes and my ears and through my shirt, and fleas hopping all through it and eating me alive, and my leg killing me at every jolt in the road. It was a verra bumpy road, too,\u201d he added broodingly.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds horrible,\u201d I said, feeling the word quite inadequate. He snorted briefly.</p><p>\u201cAye. I only stood it by imagining what I\u2019d do to Melton if I ever met him again, to get back at him for not shooting me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, and he glanced down at me, a wry smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing because it\u2019s funny,\u201d I said, gulping a little. \u201cI\u2019m laughing because otherwise I\u2019ll cry, and I don\u2019t want to\u2014not now, when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know.\u201d He squeezed my hand.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t look back. I didn\u2019t think I could stand to find out\u2014what happened.\u201d I bit my lip; the admission seemed a betrayal. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I tried\u2014that I wanted\u2014to forget,\u201d I said, groping clumsily for words. \u201cI couldn\u2019t forget you; you shouldn\u2019t think that. Not ever. But I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, Sassenach,\u201d he interrupted. He patted my hand gently. \u201cI ken what ye mean. I try not to look back myself, come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I had,\u201d I said, staring down at the smooth grain of the linen, \u201cif I had\u2014I might have found you sooner.\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the air between us like an accusation, a reminder of the bitter years of loss and separation. Finally he sighed, deeply, and put a finger under my chin, lifting my face to his.</p><p>\u201cAnd if ye had?\u201d he said. \u201cWould ye have left the lassie there without her mother? Or come to me in the time after Culloden, when I couldna care for ye, but only watch ye suffer wi\u2019 the rest, and feel the guilt of bringing ye to such a fate? Maybe see ye die of the hunger and sickness, and know I\u2019d killed ye?\u201d He raised one eyebrow in question, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. I told ye to go, and I told ye to forget. Shall I blame ye for doing as I said, Sassenach? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we might have had more time!\u201d I said. \u201cWe might have\u2014\u201d He stopped me by the simple expedient of bending and putting his mouth on mine. It was warm and very soft, and the stubble of his face was faintly scratchy on my skin.</p><p>After a moment he released me. The light was growing, putting color in his face. His skin glowed bronze, sparked with the copper of his beard. He took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAye, we might. But to think of that\u2014we cannot.\u201d His eyes met mine steadily, searching. \u201cI canna look back, Sassenach, and live,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIf we have no more than last night, and this moment, it is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me, it isn\u2019t!\u201d I said, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGreedy wee thing, are ye no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. The tension broken, I returned my attention to the scar on his leg, to keep away for the moment from the painful contemplation of lost time and opportunity.</p><p>\u201cYou were telling me how you got that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was.\u201d He rocked back a little, squinting down at the thin white line down the top of his thigh.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was Jenny\u2014my sister, ye ken?\u201d I did indeed remember Jenny; half her brother\u2019s size, and dark as he was blazing fair, but a match and more for him in stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cShe said she wasna going to let me die,\u201d he said, with a rueful smile. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t. My opinion didna seem to have anything to do wi\u2019 the matter, so she didna bother to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like Jenny.\u201d I felt a small glow of comfort at the thought of my sister-in-law. Jamie hadn\u2019t been alone as I feared, then; Jenny Murray would have fought the Devil himself to save her brother\u2014and evidently had.</p><p>\u201cShe dosed me for the fever, and put poultices on my leg to draw the poison, but nothing worked, and it only got worse. It swelled and stank, and then began to go black and rotten, so they thought they must take the leg off, if I was to live.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He recounted this quite matter-of-factly, but I felt a little faint at the thought.</p><p>\u201cObviously they didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Jamie scratched his nose and rubbed a hand back through his hair, wiping the wild spill of it out of his eyes. \u201cWell, that was Ian,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wouldna let her do it. He said he kent well enough what it was like to live wi\u2019 one leg, and while he didna mind it so much himself, he thought I wouldna like to\u2014all things considered,\u201d he added, with a wave of the hand and a glance at me that encompassed everything\u2014the loss of the battle, of the war, of me, of home and livelihood\u2014of all the things of his normal life. I thought Ian might well have been right.</p><p>\u201cSo instead Jenny made three of the tenants come to sit on me and hold me still, and then she slit my leg to the bone wi\u2019 a kitchen knife and washed the wound wi\u2019 boiling water,\u201d he said casually.</p> <p>\u201cJesus H. Christ!\u201d I blurted, shocked into horror.</p><p>He smiled faintly at my expression. \u201cAye, well, it worked.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed heavily, tasting bile. \u201cJesus. I\u2019d think you\u2019d have been a cripple for life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she cleansed it as best she could, and stitched it up. She said she wasna going to let me die, and she wasna going to have me be a cripple, and she wasna going to have me lie about all the day feelin\u2019 sorry for myself, and\u2014\u201d He shrugged, resigned. \u201cBy the time she finished tellin\u2019 me all the things she wouldna let me do, it seemed the only thing left to me was to get well.\u201d</p><p>I echoed his laugh, and his smile broadened at the memory. \u201cOnce I could get up, she made Ian take me outside after dark and make me walk. Lord, we must ha\u2019 been a sight, Ian wi\u2019 his wooden leg, and me wi\u2019 my stick, limping up and down the road like a pair of lame cranes!\u201d</p> <p>I laughed again, but had to blink back tears; I could see all too well the two tall, limping figures, struggling stubbornly against darkness and pain, leaning on each other for support.</p><p>\u201cYou lived in a cave for a time, didn\u2019t you? We found the story of it.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows went up in surprise. \u201cA story about it? About me, ye mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a famous Highland legend,\u201d I told him dryly, \u201cor you will be, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor living in a cave?\u201d He looked half-pleased, half-embarrassed. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a foolish thing to make a story about, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArranging to have yourself betrayed to the English for the price on your head was maybe a little more dramatic,\u201d I said, still more dryly. \u201cTaking rather a risk there, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>The end of his nose was pink, and he looked somewhat abashed.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said awkwardly, \u201cI didna think prison would be verra dreadful, and everything considered....\u201d</p><p>I spoke as calmly as I could, but I wanted to shake him, suddenly and ridiculously furious with him in retrospect.</p><p>\u201cPrison, my arse! You knew perfectly well you might have been hanged, didn\u2019t you? And you bloody did it anyway!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to do something,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cAnd if the English were fool enough to pay good money for my lousy carcass\u2014well, there\u2019s nay law against takin\u2019 advantage of fools, is there?\u201d One corner of his mouth quirked up, and I was torn between the urge to kiss him and the urge to slap him.</p><p>I did neither, but sat up in bed and began combing the tangles out of my hair with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s open to question who the fool was,\u201d I said, not looking at him, \u201cbut even so, you should know that your daughter\u2019s very proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is?\u201d He sounded thunderstruck, and I looked up at him, laughing despite my irritation.</p> <p>\u201cWell, of course she is. You\u2019re a bloody hero, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He went quite red in the face at this, and stood up, looking thoroughly disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cMe? No!\u201d He rubbed a hand through his hair, his habit when thinking or disturbed in his mind.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI wasna heroic at all about it. It was only...I couldna bear it any longer. To see them all starving, I mean, and not be able to care for them\u2014Jenny, and Ian and the children; all the tenants and their families.\u201d He looked helplessly down at me. \u201cI really didna care if the English hanged me or not,\u201d he said. \u201cI didna think they would, because of what ye\u2019d told me, but even if I\u2019d known for sure it meant that\u2014I would ha\u2019 done it, Sassenach, and not minded. But it wasna bravery\u2014not at all.\u201d He threw up his hands in frustration, turning away. \u201cThere was nothing else I could do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said softly, after a moment. \u201cI understand.\u201d He was standing by the chiffonier, still naked, and at this, he turned half-round to face me.</p><p>\u201cDo ye, then?\u201d His face was serious.</p><p>\u201cI know you, Jamie Fraser.\u201d I spoke with more certainty than I had felt at any time since the moment I stepped through the rock.</p><p>\u201cDo ye, then?\u201d he asked again, but a faint smile shadowed his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>The smile on his lips widened, and he opened his mouth to reply. Before he could speak, though, there was a knock upon the chamber door.</p><p>I started as though I had touched a hot stove. Jamie laughed, and bent to pat my hip as he went to the door.</p><p>\u201cI expect it\u2019s the chambermaid with our breakfast, Sassenach, not the constable. And we are marrit, aye?\u201d One eyebrow rose quizzically.</p><p>\u201cEven so, shouldn\u2019t you put something on?\u201d I asked, as he reached for the doorknob.</p><p>He glanced down at himself.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think it\u2019s likely to come as a shock to anyone in this house, Sassenach. But to honor your sensibilities\u2014\u201d He grinned at me, and taking a linen towel from the washstand, wrapped it casually about his loins before pulling open the door.</p><p>I caught sight of a tall male figure standing in the hall, and promptly pulled the bedclothes over my head. This was a reaction of pure panic, for if it had been the Edinburgh constable or one of his minions, I could scarcely expect much protection from a couple of quilts. But then the visitor spoke, and I was glad that I was safely out of sight for the moment.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d The voice sounded rather startled. Despite the fact that I had not heard it in twenty years, I recognized it at once. Rolling over, I surreptitiously lifted a corner of the quilt and peeked out beneath it.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course it\u2019s me,\u201d Jamie was saying, rather testily. \u201cHave ye no got eyes, man?\u201d He pulled his brother-in-law, Ian, into the room and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cI see well enough it\u2019s you,\u201d Ian said, with a note of sharpness. \u201cI just didna ken whether to believe my eyes!\u201d His smooth brown hair showed threads of gray, and his face bore the lines of a good many years\u2019 hard work. But Joe Abernathy had been right; with his first words, the new vision merged with the old, and this was the Ian Murray I had known before.</p><p>\u201cI came here because the lad at the printshop said ye\u2019d no been there last night, and this was the address Jenny sends your letters to,\u201d he was saying. He looked round the room with wide, suspicious eyes, as though expecting something to leap out from behind the armoire. Then his gaze flicked back to his brother-in-law, who was making a perfunctory effort to secure his makeshift loincloth.</p><p>\u201cI never thought to find ye in a kittle-hoosie, Jamie!\u201d he said. \u201cI wasna sure, when the...the lady answered the door downstairs, but then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no what ye think, Ian,\u201d Jamie said shortly.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not, aye? And Jenny worrying that ye\u2019d make yourself ill, living without a woman so long!\u201d Ian snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her she needna concern herself wi\u2019 your welfare. And where\u2019s my son, then, down the hall with another o\u2019 the harlots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son?\u201d Jamie\u2019s surprise was evident. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>Ian stared at Jamie, the anger on his long, half-homely face fading into alarm.</p><p>\u201cYe havena got him? Wee Ian\u2019s not here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung Ian? Christ, man, d\u2019ye think I\u2019d bring a fourteen-year-old lad into a brothel?\u201d</p><p>Ian opened his mouth, then shut it, and sat down on the stool.</p><p>\u201cTell ye the truth, Jamie, I canna say what ye\u2019d do anymore,\u201d he said levelly. He looked up at his brother-in-law, jaw set. \u201cOnce I could. But not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what the hell d\u2019ye mean by that?\u201d I could see the angry flush rising in Jamie\u2019s face.</p><p>Ian glanced at the bed, and away again. The red flush didn\u2019t recede from Jamie\u2019s face, but I saw a small quiver at the corner of his mouth. He bowed elaborately to his brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, Ian, I was forgettin\u2019 my manners. Allow me to introduce ye to my companion.\u201d He stepped to the side of the bed and pulled back the quilts.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ian cried, jumping to his feet and looking frantically at the floor, the wardrobe, anywhere but at the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat, will ye no give your regards to my wife, Ian?\u201d Jamie said.</p><p>\u201cWife?\u201d Forgetting to look away, Ian goggled at Jamie in horror. \u201cYe\u2019ve marrit a whore?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it that, exactly,\u201d I said. Hearing my voice, Ian jerked his head in my direction.</p><p>\u201cHullo,\u201d I said, waving cheerily at him from my nest of bedclothes. \u201cBeen a long time, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d always thought the descriptions of what people did when seeing ghosts rather exaggerated, but had been forced to revise my opinions in light of the responses I had been getting since my return to the past. Jamie had fainted dead away, and if Ian\u2019s hair was not literally standing on end, he assuredly looked as though he had been scared out of his wits.</p><p>Eyes bugging out, he opened and closed his mouth, making a small gobbling noise that seemed to entertain Jamie quite a lot.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll teach ye to go about thinkin\u2019 the worst of my character,\u201d he said, with apparent satisfaction. Taking pity on his quivering brother-in-law, Jamie poured out a tot of brandy and handed him the glass. \u201cJudge not, and ye\u2019ll no be judged, eh?\u201d</p><p>I thought Ian was going to spill the drink on his breeches, but he managed to get the glass to his mouth and swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d he wheezed, eyes watering as he stared at me. \u201cHow\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d I said, with a glance at Jamie. He nodded briefly. We had had other things to think about in the last twenty-four hours besides how to explain me to people, and under the circumstances, I rather thought explanations could wait.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I know Young Ian. Is he missing?\u201d I asked politely.</p><p>Ian nodded mechanically, not taking his eyes off me.</p><p>\u201cHe stole away from home last Friday week,\u201d he said, sounding rather dazed. \u201cLeft a note that he\u2019d gone to his uncle.\u201d He took another swig of brandy, coughed and blinked several times, then wiped his eyes and sat up straighter, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll no be the first time, ye see,\u201d he said to me. He seemed to be regaining his self-confidence, seeing that I appeared to be flesh and blood, and showed no signs either of getting out of bed, or of putting my head under my arm and strolling round without it, in the accepted fashion of Highland ghosts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie sat down on the bed next to me, taking my hand in his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not seen Young Ian since I sent him home wi\u2019 Fergus six months ago,\u201d he said. He was beginning to look as worried as Ian. \u201cYou\u2019re sure he said he was coming to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he hasna got any other uncles that I know of,\u201d Ian said, rather acerbically. He tossed back the rest of the brandy and set the cup down.</p><p>\u201cFergus?\u201d I interrupted. \u201cIs Fergus all right, then?\u201d I felt a surge of joy at the mention of the French orphan whom Jamie had once hired in Paris as a pickpocket, and brought back to Scotland as a servant lad.</p> <p>Distracted from his thoughts, Jamie looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, Fergus is a bonny man now. A bit changed, of course.\u201d A shadow seemed to cross his face, but it cleared as he smiled, pressing my hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fair daft at seein\u2019 you once more, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Uninterested in Fergus, Ian had risen and was pacing back and forth across the polished plank floor.</p><p>\u201cHe didna take a horse,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSo he\u2019d have nothing anyone would rob him for.\u201d He swung round to Jamie. \u201cHow did ye come, last time ye brought the lad here? By the land round the Firth, or did ye cross by boat?\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed his chin, frowning as he thought. \u201cI didna come to Lallybroch for him. He and Fergus crossed through the Carryarrick Pass and met me just above Loch Laggan. Then we came down through Struan and Weem and...aye, now I remember. We didna want to cross the Campbell lands, so we came to the east, and crossed the Forth at Donibristle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019ye think he\u2019d do that again?\u201d Ian asked. \u201cIf it\u2019s the only way he knows?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head doubtfully. \u201cHe might. But he kens the coast is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Ian resumed his pacing, hands clasped behind his back. \u201cI beat him \u2019til he could barely stand, let alone sit, the last time he ran off,\u201d Ian said, shaking his head. His lips were tight, and I gathered that Young Ian was perhaps rather a trial to his father. \u201cYe\u2019d think the wee fool would think better o\u2019 such tricks, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted, but not without sympathy.</p><p>\u201cDid a thrashing ever stop you from doing anything you\u2019d set your mind on?\u201d</p><p>Ian stopped his pacing and sat down on the stool again, sighing.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said frankly, \u201cbut I expect it was some relief to my father.\u201d His face cracked into a reluctant smile, as Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Jamie declared confidently. He stood up and let the towel drop to the floor as he reached for his breeches. \u201cI\u2019ll go and put about the word for him. If he\u2019s in Edinburgh, we\u2019ll hear of it by nightfall.\u201d</p><p>Ian cast a glance at me in the bed, and stood up hastily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go wi\u2019 ye.\u201d</p><p>I thought I saw a shadow of doubt flicker across Jamie\u2019s face, but then he nodded and pulled the shirt over his head.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, as his head popped through the slit. He frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid ye\u2019ll have to stay here, Sassenach,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I will,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cSeeing that I haven\u2019t any clothes.\u201d The maid who brought our supper had removed my dress, and no replacement had as yet appeared.</p> <p>Ian\u2019s feathery brows shot up to his hairline, but Jamie merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Jeanne on the way out,\u201d he said. He frowned slightly, thinking. \u201cIt may be some time, Sassenach. There are things\u2014well, I\u2019ve business to take care of.\u201d He squeezed my hand, his expression softening as he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI dinna want to leave ye,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut I must. You\u2019ll stay here until I come again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I assured him, waving a hand at the linen towel he had just discarded. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to go anywhere in that.\u201d</p><p>The thud of their feet retreated down the hall and faded into the sounds of the stirring house. The brothel was rising, late and languid by the stern Scottish standards of Edinburgh. Below me I could hear the occasional slow muffled thump, the clatter of shutters thrust open nearby, a cry of \u201cGardyloo!\u201d and a second later, the splash of slops flung out to land on the street far below.</p><p>Voices somewhere far down the hall, a brief inaudible exchange, and the closing of a door. The building itself seemed to stretch and sigh, with a creaking of timbers and a squeaking of stairs, and a sudden puff of coal-smelling warm air came out from the back of the cold hearth, the exhalation of a fire lit on some lower floor, sharing my chimney.</p><p>I relaxed into the pillows, feeling drowsy and heavily content. I was slightly and pleasantly sore in several unaccustomed places, and while I had been reluctant to see Jamie go, there was no denying that it was nice to be alone for a bit to mull things over.</p><p>I felt much like one who has been handed a sealed casket containing a long-lost treasure. I could feel the satisfying weight and the shape of it, and know the great joy of its possession, but still did not know exactly what was contained therein.</p><p>I was dying to know everything he had done and said and thought and been, through all the days between us. I had of course known that if he had survived Culloden, he would have a life\u2014and knowing what I did of Jamie Fraser, it was unlikely to be a simple one. But knowing that, and being confronted with the reality of it, were two different things.</p><p>He had been fixed in my memory for so long, glowing but static, like an insect frozen in amber. And then had come Roger\u2019s brief historical sightings, like peeks through a keyhole; separate pictures like punctuations, alterations; adjustments of memory, each showing the dragonfly\u2019s wings raised or lowered at a different angle, like the single frames of a motion picture. Now time had begun to run again for us, and the dragonfly was in flight before me, flickering from place to place, so I saw little more yet than the glitter of its wings.</p><p>There were so many questions neither of us had had a chance to ask yet\u2014what of his family at Lallybroch, his sister Jenny and her children? Obviously Ian was alive, and well, wooden leg notwithstanding\u2014but had the rest of the family and the tenants of the estate survived the destruction of the Highlands? If they had, why was Jamie here in Edinburgh?</p><p>And if they were alive\u2014what would we tell them about my sudden reappearance? I bit my lip, wondering whether there was any explanation\u2014short of the truth\u2014which might make sense. It might depend on what Jamie had told them when I disappeared after Culloden; there had seemed no need to concoct a reason for my vanishing at the time; it would simply be assumed that I had perished in the aftermath of the Rising, one more of the nameless corpses lying starved on the rocks or slaughtered in a leafless glen.</p><p>Well, we\u2019d manage that when we came to it, I supposed. I was more curious just now about the extent and the danger of Jamie\u2019s less legitimate activities. Smuggling and sedition, was it? I was aware that smuggling was nearly as honorable a profession in the Scottish Highlands as cattle-stealing had been twenty years before, and might be conducted with relatively little risk. Sedition was something else, and seemed like an occupation of dubious safety for a convicted ex-Jacobite traitor.</p><p>That, I supposed, was the reason for his assumed name\u2014or one reason, at any rate. Disturbed and excited as I had been when we arrived at the brothel the night before, I had noticed that Madame Jeanne referred to him by his own name. So presumably he smuggled under his own identity, but carried out his publishing activities\u2014legal and illegal\u2014as Alex Malcolm.</p><p>I had seen, heard and felt enough, during the all too brief hours of the night, to be fairly sure that the Jamie Fraser I had known still existed. How many other men he might be now remained to be seen.</p><p>There was a tentative rap at the door, interrupting my thoughts. Breakfast, I thought, and not before time. I was ravenous.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I called, and sat up in bed, pulling up the pillows to lean against.</p><p>The door opened very slowly, and after quite a long pause, a head poked its way through the opening, much in the manner of a snail emerging from its shell after a hailstorm.</p><p>It was topped with an ill-cut shag of dark brown hair so thick that the cropped edges stuck out like a shelf above a pair of large ears. The face beneath was long and bony; rather pleasantly homely, save for a pair of beautiful brown eyes, soft and huge as a deer\u2019s, that rested on me with a mingled expression of interest and hesitancy.</p><p>The head and I regarded each other for a moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you Mr. Malcolm\u2019s...woman?\u201d it asked.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you could say so,\u201d I replied cautiously. This was obviously not the chambermaid with my breakfast. Neither was it likely to be one of the other employees of the establishment, being evidently male, though very young. He seemed vaguely familiar, though I was sure I hadn\u2019t seen him before. I pulled the sheet a bit higher over my br**sts. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d I inquired.</p><p>The head thought this over for some time, and finally answered, with equal caution, \u201cIan Murray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan Murray?\u201d I shot up straight, rescuing the sheet at the last moment. \u201cCome in here,\u201d I said peremptorily. \u201cIf you\u2019re who I think you are, why aren\u2019t you where you\u2019re supposed to be, and what are you doing here?\u201d The face looked rather alarmed, and showed signs of withdrawal.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I called, and put a leg out of bed to pursue him. The big brown eyes widened at the sight of my bare limb, and he froze. \u201cCome in, I said.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I withdrew the leg beneath the quilts, and equally slowly, he followed it into the room.</p><p>He was tall and gangly as a fledgling stork, with perhaps nine stone spread sparsely over a six-foot frame. Now that I knew who he was, the resemblance to his father was clear. He had his mother\u2019s pale skin, though, which blushed furiously red as it occurred to him suddenly that he was standing next to a bed containing a naked woman.</p><p>\u201cI...er...was looking for my...for Mr. Malcolm, I mean,\u201d he murmured, staring fixedly at the floorboards by his feet.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean your uncle Jamie, he\u2019s not here,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I suppose not.\u201d He seemed unable to think of anything to add to this, but remained staring at the floor, one foot twisted awkwardly to the side, as though he were about to draw it up under him, like the wading bird he so much resembled.</p><p>\u201cDo ye ken where...\u201d he began, lifting his eyes, then, as he caught a glimpse of me, lowered them, blushed again and fell silent.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking for you,\u201d I said. \u201cWith your father,\u201d I added. \u201cThey left here not half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up on its skinny neck, goggling.</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d he gasped. \u201cMy father was here? Ye know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes,\u201d I said, without thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve known Ian for quite a long time.\u201d</p><p>He might be Jamie\u2019s nephew, but he hadn\u2019t Jamie\u2019s trick of inscrutability. Everything he thought showed on his face, and I could easily trace the progression of his expressions. Raw shock at learning of his father\u2019s presence in Edinburgh, then a sort of awestruck horror at the revelation of his father\u2019s long-standing acquaintance with what appeared to be a woman of a certain occupation, and finally the beginnings of angry absorption, as the young man began an immediate revision of his opinions of his father\u2019s character. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEr\u2014\u201d I said, mildly alarmed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think. I mean, your father and I\u2014it\u2019s really your uncle and I, I mean\u2014\u201d I was trying to figure out how to explain the situation to him without getting into even deeper waters, when he whirled on his heel and started for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I said. He stopped, but didn\u2019t turn around. His well-scrubbed ears stood out like tiny wings, the morning light illuminating their delicate pinkness. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He turned around to face me, with a certain painful dignity. \u201cI\u2019ll be fifteen in three weeks,\u201d he said. The red was creeping up his cheeks again. \u201cDinna worry, I\u2019m old enough to know\u2014what sort of place this is, I mean.\u201d He jerked his head toward me in an attempt at a courtly bow.</p><p>\u201cMeaning no offense to ye, mistress. If Uncle Jamie\u2014I mean, I\u2014\u201d he groped for suitable words, failed to find any, and finally blurted, \u201cverra pleased to meet ye, mum!\u201d turned and bolted through the door, which shut hard enough to rattle in its frame.</p> <p>I fell back against the pillows, torn between amusement and alarm. I did wonder what the elder Ian was going to say to his son when they met\u2014and vice versa. As long as I was wondering, I wondered what had brought the younger Ian here in search of Jamie. Evidently, he knew where his uncle was likely to be found; yet judging from his diffident attitude, he had never before ventured into the brothel.</p><p>Had he extracted the information from Geordie at the printshop? That seemed unlikely. And yet, if he hadn\u2019t\u2014then that meant he had learned of his uncle\u2019s connection with this place from some other source. And the most likely source was Jamie himself.</p><p>But in that case, I reasoned, Jamie likely already knew that his nephew was in Edinburgh, so why pretend he hadn\u2019t seen the boy? Ian was Jamie\u2019s oldest friend; they had grown up together. If whatever Jamie was up to was worth the cost of deceiving his brother-in-law, it was something serious.</p><p>I had got no further with my musings, when there came another knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I said, smoothing out the quilts in anticipation of the breakfast tray to be placed thereon.</p> <p>When the door opened, I had directed my attention at a spot about five feet above the floor, where I expected the chambermaid\u2019s head to materialize. Upon the last opening of the door, I had had to adjust my vision upward a foot, to accommodate the appearance of Young Ian. This time, I was obliged to drop it.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the bloody hell are you doing here?\u201d I demanded as the diminutive figure of Mr. Willoughby entered on hands and knees. I sat up and hastily tucked my feet underneath me, pulling not only sheet but quilts well up around my shoulders.</p><p>In answer, the Chinese advanced to within a foot of the bed, then let his head fall to the floor with a loud clunk. He raised it and repeated the process with great deliberation, making a horrid sound like a melon being cleaved with an ax.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d I exclaimed, as he prepared to do it a third time.</p><p>\u201cThousand apology,\u201d he explained, sitting up on his heels and blinking at me. He was quite a bit the worse for wear, and the dark red mark where his forehead had smacked the floor didn\u2019t add anything to his appearance. I trusted he didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d been going to hit his head on the floor a thousand times, but I wasn\u2019t sure. He obviously had the hell of a hangover; for him to have attempted it even once was impressive.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d I said, edging cautiously back against the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to apologize for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, apology,\u201d he insisted. \u201cTsei-mi saying wife. Lady being most honorable First Wife, not stinking whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I said. \u201cTsei-mi? You mean Jamie? Jamie Fraser?\u201d</p><p>The little man nodded, to the obvious detriment of his head. He clutched it with both hands and closed his eyes, which promptly disappeared into the creases of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cTsei-mi,\u201d he affirmed, eyes still closed. \u201cTsei-mi saying apology to most honored First Wife. Yi Tien Cho most humble servant.\u201d He bowed deeply, still holding onto his head. \u201cYi Tien Cho,\u201d he added, opening his eyes and tapping his chest to indicate that that was his name; in case I should be confusing him with any other humble servants in the vicinity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d I said. \u201cEr, pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Evidently heartened by this, he slid bonelessly onto his face, prostrating himself before me.</p><p>\u201cYi Tien Cho lady\u2019s servant,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst Wife please to walk on humble servant, if like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. Walk on you, eh? Not bloody likely!\u201d</p> <p>A slit of gleaming black eye showed, and he giggled, so irrepressibly that I couldn\u2019t help laughing myself. He sat up again, smoothing down the spikes of dirt-stiffened black hair that sprang, porcupine-like, from his skull.</p><p>\u201cI wash First Wife\u2019s feet?\u201d he offered, grinning widely.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you really want to do something helpful, go and tell someone to bring me breakfast. No, wait a minute,\u201d I said, changing my mind. \u201cFirst, tell me where you met Jamie. If you don\u2019t mind,\u201d I added, to be polite.</p><p>He sat back on his heels, head bobbing slightly. \u201cDocks,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo year ago. I come China, long way, no food. Hiding barrel,\u201d he explained, reaching his arms in a circle, to demonstrate his means of transportation.</p><p>\u201cA stowaway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrade ship,\u201d he nodded. \u201cOn docks here, stealing food. Stealing brandy one night, getting stinking drunk. Very cold to sleep; die soon, but Tsei-mi find.\u201d He jabbed a thumb at his chest once more. \u201cTsei-mi\u2019s humble servant. Humble servant First Wife.\u201d He bowed to me, swaying alarmingly in the process, but came upright again without mishap.</p><p>\u201cBrandy seems to be your downfall,\u201d I observed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t anything to give you for your head; I don\u2019t have any medicines with me at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not worry,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI having healthy balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice for you,\u201d I said, trying to decide whether he was gearing up for another attempt on my feet, or merely still too drunk to distinguish basic anatomy. Or perhaps there was some connection in Chinese philosophy, between the well-being of head and testicles? Just in case, I looked round for something that might be used as a weapon, in case he showed a disposition to begin burrowing under the bedclothes.</p><p>Instead, he reached into the depths of one baggy blue-silk sleeve and with the air of a conjuror, drew out a small white silk bag. He upended this, and two balls dropped out into his palm. They were larger than marbles and smaller than baseballs; about the size, in fact, of the average testicle. A good deal harder, though, being apparently made of some kind of polished stone, greenish in color.</p><p>\u201cHealthy balls,\u201d Mr. Willoughby explained, rolling them together in his palm. They made a pleasant clicking noise. \u201cStreaked jade, from Canton,\u201d he said. \u201cBest kind of healthy balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, fascinated. \u201cAnd they\u2019re medicinal\u2014good for you, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>He nodded vigorously, then stopped abruptly with a faint moan. After a pause, he spread out his hand, and rolled the balls to and fro, keeping them in movement with a dextrous circling of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAll body one part; hand all parts,\u201d he said. He poked a finger toward his open palm, touching delicately here and there between the smooth green spheres. \u201cHead there, stomach there, liver there,\u201d he said. \u201cBalls make all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose they\u2019re as portable as Alka-Seltzer,\u201d I said. Possibly it was the reference to stomach that caused my own to emit a loud growl at this point.</p><p>\u201cFirst Wife wanting food,\u201d Mr. Willoughby observed shrewdly.</p><p>\u201cVery astute of you,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, I do want food. Do you suppose you could go and tell someone?\u201d</p><p>He dumped the healthy balls back into their bag at once, and springing to his feet, bowed deeply.</p><p>\u201cHumble servant go now,\u201d he said, and went, crashing rather heavily into the door post on his way out.</p><p>This was becoming ridiculous, I thought. I harbored substantial doubt as to whether Mr. Willoughby\u2019s visit would result in food; he\u2019d be lucky to make it to the bottom of the stair without falling on his head, if I was any judge of his condition.</p><p>Rather than go on sitting here in the nude, receiving random deputations from the outside world, I thought it time to take steps. Rising and carefully wrapping a quilt around my body, I took a few, out into the corridor.</p><p>The upper floor seemed deserted. Aside from the room I had left, there were only two other doors up here. Glancing up, I could see unadorned rafters overhead. We were in the attic then; chances were that the other rooms here were occupied by servants, who were presumably now employed downstairs.</p><p>I could hear faint noises drifting up the stairwell. Something else drifted up, as well\u2014the scent of frying sausage. A loud gustatory rumble informed me that my stomach hadn\u2019t missed this, and furthermore, that my innards considered the consumption of one peanut butter sandwich and one bowl of soup in one twenty-four-hour period a wholly inadequate level of nutrition.</p><p>I tucked the ends of the quilt in, sarong-fashion, just above my br**sts, and picking up my trailing skirts, followed the scent of food downstairs.</p><p>The smell\u2014and the clinking, clattering, sloshing noises of a number of people eating\u2014were coming from a closed door on the first floor above ground level. I pushed it open, and found myself at the end of a long room equipped as a refectory.</p><p>The table was surrounded by twenty-odd women, a few gowned for day, but most of them in a state of dishabille that made my quilt modest by comparison. A woman near the end of the table caught sight of me hovering in the doorway, and beckoned, companionably sliding over to make room for me on the end of the long bench.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the new lass, aye?\u201d she said, looking me over with interest. \u201cYou\u2019re a wee bit older than Madame usually takes on\u2014she likes \u2019em no more than five and twenty. You\u2019re no bad at all, though,\u201d she assured me hastily. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood skin and a pretty face,\u201d observed the dark-haired lady across from us, sizing me up with the detached air of one appraising horseflesh. \u201cAnd nice bubbies, what I can see.\u201d She lifted her chin slightly, peering across the table at what could be seen of my cle**age.</p><p>\u201cMadame doesna like us to take the kivvers off the beds,\u201d my original acquaintance said reprovingly. \u201cYe should wear your shift, if ye havena something pretty to show yourself in yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, be careful with the quilt,\u201d advised the dark-haired girl, still scrutinizing me. \u201cMadame\u2019ll dock your wages, an\u2019 ye get spots on the bedclothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, my dearie?\u201d A short, rather plump girl with a round, friendly face leaned past the dark girl\u2019s elbow to smile at me. \u201cHere we\u2019re all chatterin\u2019 at ye, and not welcomed ye proper at all. I\u2019m Dorcas, this is Peggy\u201d\u2014she jerked a thumb at the dark-haired girl, then pointed across the table to the fair-haired woman beside me\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s Mollie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy name is Claire,\u201d I said, smiling and hitching the quilt a bit higher in self-consciousness. I wasn\u2019t sure how to correct their impression that I was Madame Jeanne\u2019s newest recruit; for the moment, that seemed less important than getting some breakfast.</p><p>Apparently divining my need, the friendly Dorcas reached to the sideboard behind her, passed me a wooden plate, and shoved a large dish of sausages in my direction.</p><p>The food was well-cooked and would have been good in any case; starved as I was, it was ambrosial. A hell of a lot better than the hospital cafeteria\u2019s breakfasts, I observed to myself, taking another ladle of fried potatoes.</p><p>\u201cHad a rough one for your first, aye?\u201d Millie, next to me, nodded at my bosom. Glancing down, I was mortified to see a large red patch peeking above the edge of my quilt. I couldn\u2019t see my neck, but the direction of Millie\u2019s interested gaze made it clear that the small tingling sensations there were evidence of further bite-marks.</p> <p>\u201cYour nose is a wee bit puffed, too,\u201d Peggy said, frowning at me critically. She reached across the table to touch it, disregarding the fact that the gesture caused her flimsy wrap to fall open to the waist. \u201cSlap ye, did he? If they get too rough, ye should call out, ye know; Madame doesna allow the customers to mistreat us\u2014give a good screech and Bruno will be in there in a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruno?\u201d I said, a little faintly.</p><p>\u201cThe porter,\u201d Dorcas explained, busily spooning eggs into her mouth. \u201cBig as a bear\u2014that\u2019s why we call him Bruno. What\u2019s his name really?\u201d she asked the table at large, \u201cHorace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheobald,\u201d corrected Millie. She turned to call to a servingmaid at the end of the room, \u201cJanie, will ye fetch in more ale? The new lassie\u2019s had none yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Peggy\u2019s right,\u201d she said, turning back to me. She wasn\u2019t at all pretty, but had a nicely shaped mouth and a pleasant expression. \u201cIf ye get a man likes to play a bit rough, that\u2019s one thing\u2014and don\u2019t sic Bruno on a good customer, or there\u2019ll be hell to pay, and you\u2019ll do the paying. But if ye think ye might really be damaged, then just give a good skelloch. Bruno\u2019s never far away during the night. Oh, here\u2019s the ale,\u201d she added, taking a big pewter mug from the servingmaid and plonking it in front of me.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s no damaged,\u201d Dorcas said, having completed her survey of the visible aspects of my person. \u201cA bit sore between the legs, though, aye?\u201d she said shrewdly, grinning at me.</p><p>\u201cOoh, look, she\u2019s blushing,\u201d said Mollie, giggling with delight. \u201cOoh, you are a fresh one, aren\u2019t ye?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep gulp of the ale. It was dark, rich, and extremely welcome, as much for the width of the cup rim that hid my face as for its taste.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Mollie patted my arm kindly. \u201cAfter breakfast, I\u2019ll show ye where the tubs are. Ye can soak your parts in warm water, and they\u2019ll be good as new by tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure to show her where the jars are, too,\u201d put in Dorcas. \u201cSweet herbs,\u201d she explained to me. \u201cPut them in the water before ye sit in it. Madame likes us to smell sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEef ze men want to lie wiz a feesh, zey would go to ze docks; eet ees more cheap,\u201d Peggy intoned, in what was patently meant to be an imitation of Madame Jeanne. The table erupted in giggles, which were rapidly quelled by the sudden appearance of Madame herself, who entered through a door at the end of the room.</p> <p>Madame Jeanne was frowning in a worried fashion, and seemed too preoccupied to notice the smothered hilarity.</p><p>\u201cTsk!\u201d murmured Mollie, seeing the proprietor. \u201cAn early customer. I hate it when they come in the middle o\u2019 breakfast,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cStop ye digesting your food proper, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe needn\u2019t worry, Mollie; it\u2019s Claire\u2019ll have to take him,\u201d Peggy said, tossing her dark plait out of the way. \u201cNewest lass takes the ones no one wants,\u201d she informed me.</p><p>\u201cStick your finger up his bum,\u201d Dorcas advised me. \u201cThat brings \u2019em off faster than anything. I\u2019ll save ye a bannock for after, if ye like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...thanks,\u201d I said. Just then, Madame Jeanne\u2019s eye lit upon me, and her mouth dropped open in a horrified \u201cO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she hissed, rushing up to grab me by the arm.</p><p>\u201cEating,\u201d I said, in no mood to be snatched at. I detached my arm from her grasp and picked up my ale cup.</p><p>\u201cMerde!\u201d she said. \u201cDid no one bring you food this morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cNor yet clothes.\u201d I gestured at the quilt, which was in imminent danger of falling off.</p><p>\u201cNez de Cleopatre!\u201d she said violently. She stood up and glanced around the room, eyes flashing daggers. \u201cI will have the worthless scum of a maid flayed for this! A thousand apologies, Madame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d I said graciously, aware of the looks of astonishment on the faces of my breakfast companions. \u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful meal. Nice to have met you all, ladies,\u201d I said, rising and doing my best to bow graciously while clutching my quilt. \u201cNow, Madame...about my gown?\u201d</p><p>Amid Madame Jeanne\u2019s agitated protestations of apology, and reiterated hopes that I would not find it necessary to tell Monsieur Fraser that I had been exposed to an undesirable intimacy with the working members of the establishment, I made my clumsy way up two more flights of stairs, and into a small room draped with hanging garments in various stages of completion, with bolts of cloth stacked here and there in the corners of the chamber.</p><p>\u201cA moment, please,\u201d Madame Jeanne said, and with a deep bow, left me to the company of a dressmaker\u2019s dummy, with a large number of pins protruding from its stuffed bosom.</p><p>Apparently this was where the costuming of the inmates took place. I walked around the room, quilt trailing, and observed several flimsy silk wrappers under construction, together with a couple of elaborate gowns with very low necks, and a number of rather imaginative variations on the basic shift and camisole. I removed one shift from its hook, and put it on.</p><p>It was made of fine cotton, with a low, gathered neck, and embroidery in the form of multiple hands that curled enticingly under the bosom and down the sides of the waist, spreading out into a rakish caress atop the hips. It hadn\u2019t been hemmed, but was otherwise complete, and gave me a great deal more freedom of movement than had the quilt.</p><p>I could hear voices in the next room, where Madame was apparently haranguing Bruno\u2014or so I deduced the identity of the male rumble.</p><p>\u201cI do not care what the miserable girl\u2019s sister has done,\u201d she was saying, \u201cdo you not realize that the wife of Monsieur Jamie was left naked and starving\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s his wife?\u201d the deep male voice asked. \u201cI had heard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo had I. But if he says this woman is his wife, I am not disposed to argue, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d Madame sounded impatient. \u201cNow, as to this wretched Madeleine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her fault, Madame,\u201d Bruno broke in. \u201cHave you not heard the news this morning\u2014about the Fiend?\u201d</p><p>Madame gave a small gasp. \u201cNo! Not another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Madame.\u201d Bruno\u2019s voice was grim. \u201cNo more than a few doors away\u2014above the Green Owl tavern. The girl was Madeleine\u2019s sister; the priest brought the news just before breakfast. So you can see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see.\u201d Madame sounded a little breathless. \u201cYes, of course. Of course. Was it\u2014the same?\u201d Her voice quivered with distaste.</p><p>\u201cYes, Madame. A hatchet or a big knife of some sort.\u201d He lowered his voice, as people do when recounting horrid things. \u201cThe priest told me that her head had been completely severed. Her body was near the door of her room, and her head\u201d\u2014his voice dropped even lower, almost to a whisper\u2014\u201cher head was sitting on the mantelpiece, looking into the room. The landlord swooned when he found her.\u201d</p><p>A heavy thud from the next room suggested that Madame Jeanne had done likewise. Gooseflesh rippled up my arms, and my own knees felt a trifle watery. I was beginning to agree with Jamie\u2019s fear that his installing me in a house of prostitution had been injudicious.</p><p>At any rate, I was now clad, if not entirely dressed, and I went into the room next door, to find Madame Jeanne in semi-recline on the sofa of a small parlor, with a burly, unhappy-looking man sitting on the hassock near her feet.</p><p>Madame started up at the sight of me. \u201cMadame Fraser! Oh, I am so sorry! I did not mean to leave you waiting, but I have had...\u201d she hesitated, looking for some delicate expression \u201c...some distressing news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about a Fiend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d She was already pale; now her complexion went a few shades whiter, and she wrung her hands. \u201cWhat will he say? He will be furious!\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked. \u201cJamie, or the Fiend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband,\u201d she said. She looked about the parlor, distracted. \u201cWhen he hears that his wife has been so shamefully neglected, mistaken for a fille de joie and exposed to\u2014to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I would like to hear about the Fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Bruno\u2019s heavy eyebrows rose. He was a big man, with sloping shoulders and long arms that made him look rather like a gorilla; a resemblance enhanced by a low brow and a receding chin. He looked eminently suited to the role of bouncer in a brothel.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he hesitated, glancing at Madame Jeanne for guidance, but the proprietor caught sight of the small enameled clock on the mantelpiece and jumped to her feet with an exclamation of shock.</p><p>\u201cCrottin!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI must go!\u201d And with no more than a perfunctory wave in my direction, she sped from the room, leaving Bruno and me looking after her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, recovering himself. \u201cThat\u2019s right, it was coming at ten o\u2019clock.\u201d It was a quarter-past ten, by the enamel clock. Whatever \u201cit\u201d was, I hoped it would wait.</p><p>\u201cFiend,\u201d I prompted.</p><p>Like most people, Bruno was only too willing to reveal all the gory details, once past a pro forma demur for the sake of social delicacy.</p><p>The Edinburgh Fiend was\u2014as I had deduced from the conversation thus far\u2014a murderer. Like an early-day Jack the Ripper, he specialized in women of easy virtue, whom he killed with blows from a heavy-bladed instrument. In some cases, the bodies had been dismembered or otherwise \u201cinterfered with,\u201d as Bruno said, in lowered voice.</p><p>The killings\u2014eight in all\u2014had occurred at intervals over the last two years. With one exception, the women had been killed in their own rooms; most lived alone\u2014two had been killed in brothels. Hence Madame\u2019s agitation, I supposed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the exception?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Bruno crossed himself. \u201cA nun,\u201d he whispered, the words evidently still a shock to him. \u201cA French Sister of Mercy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Sister, coming ashore at Edinburgh with a group of nuns bound for London, had been abducted from the docks, without any of her companions noticing her absence in the confusion. By the time she was discovered in one of Edinburgh\u2019s wynds, after nightfall, it was far too late.</p><p>\u201cRaped?\u201d I asked, with clinical interest.</p><p>Bruno eyed me with considerable suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI do not know,\u201d he said formally. He rose heavily to his feet, his simian shoulders drooping with fatigue. I supposed he had been on duty all night; it must be his bedtime now. \u201cIf you will excuse me, Madame,\u201d he said, with remote formality, and went out.</p> <p>I sat back on the small velvet sofa, feeling mildly dazed. Somehow I hadn\u2019t realized that quite so much went on in brothels in the daytime.</p><p>There was a sudden loud hammering at the door. It didn\u2019t sound like knocking, but as though someone really were using a metal-headed hammer to demand admittance. I got to my feet to answer the summons, but without further warning, the door burst open, and a slender imperious figure strode into the room, speaking French in an accent so pronounced and an attitude so furious that I could not follow it all.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for Madame Jeanne?\u201d I managed to put in, seizing a small pause when he stopped to draw breath for more invective. The visitor was a young man of about thirty, slightly built and strikingly handsome, with thick black hair and brows. He glared at me under these, and as he got a good look at me, an extraordinary change went across his face. The brows rose, his black eyes grew huge, and his face went white.</p><p>\u201cMilady!\u201d he exclaimed, and flung himself on his knees, embracing me about the thighs as he pressed his face into the cotton shift at crotch level.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d I exclaimed, shoving at his shoulders to detach him. \u201cI don\u2019t work here. Let go, I say!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMilady!\u201d he was repeating in tones of rapture. \u201cMilady! You have come back! A miracle! God has restored you!\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, smiling as tears streamed down his face. He had large white perfect teeth. Suddenly memory stirred and shifted, showing me the outlines of an urchin\u2019s face beneath the man\u2019s bold visage.</p><p>\u201cFergus!\u201d I said. \u201cFergus, is that really you? Get up, for God\u2019s sake\u2014let me see you!\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet, but didn\u2019t pause to let me inspect him. He gathered me into a rib-cracking hug, and I clutched him in return, pounding his back in the excitement of seeing him again. He had been ten or so when I last saw him, just before Culloden. Now he was a man, and the stubble of his beard rasped against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was seeing a ghost!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cIt is really you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me,\u201d I assured him.</p> <p>\u201cYou have seen milord?\u201d he asked excitedly. \u201cHe knows you are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d He blinked and stepped back half a pace, as something occurred to him. \u201cBut\u2014but what about\u2014\u201d He paused, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cWhat about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ye are! What in the name of God are ye doing up here, Fergus?\u201d Jamie\u2019s tall figure loomed suddenly in the doorway. His eyes widened at the sight of me in my embroidered shift. \u201cWhere are your clothes?\u201d he asked. \u201cNever mind,\u201d he said then, waving his hand impatiently as I opened my mouth to answer. \u201cI havena time just now. Come along, Fergus, there\u2019s eighteen ankers of brandy in the alleyway, and the excisemen on my heels!\u201d</p><p>And with a thunder of boots on the wooden staircase, they were gone, leaving me alone once more.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whether I should join the party downstairs or not, but curiosity got the better of discretion. After a quick visit to the sewing room in search of more extensive covering, I made my way down, a large shawl half-embroidered with hollyhocks flung round my shoulders.</p><p>I had gathered only a vague impression of the layout of the house the night before, but the street noises that filtered through the windows made it clear which side of the building faced the High Street. I assumed the alleyway to which Jamie had referred must be on the other side, but wasn\u2019t sure. The houses of Edinburgh were frequently constructed with odd little wings and twisting walls, to take advantage of every inch of space.</p> <p>I paused on the large landing at the foot of the stairs, listening for the sound of rolling casks as a guide. As I stood there, I felt a sudden draft on my bare feet, and turned to see a man standing in the open doorway from the kitchen.</p><p>He seemed as surprised as I, but after blinking at me, he smiled and stepped forward to grip me by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cAnd a good morning to you, my dear. I didn\u2019t expect to find any of you ladies up and about so early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what they say about early to bed and early to rise,\u201d I said, trying to extricate my elbow.</p><p>He laughed, showing rather badly stained teeth in a narrow jaw. \u201cNo, what do they say about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s something they say in America, come to think of it,\u201d I replied, suddenly realizing that Benjamin Franklin, even if currently publishing, probably didn\u2019t have a wide readership in Edinburgh.</p><p>\u201cGot a wit about you, chuckie,\u201d he said, with a slight smile. \u201cSend you down as a decoy, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Who?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe madam,\u201d he said, glancing around. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I said. \u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>Instead, he tightened his grip, so that his fingers dug uncomfortably into the muscles of my upper arm. He leaned closer, whispering in my ear with a gust of stale tobacco fumes.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reward, you know,\u201d he murmured confidentially. \u201cA percentage of the value of the seized contraband. No one would need to know but you and me.\u201d He flicked one finger gently under my breast, making the nipple stand up under the thin cotton. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye say, chuck?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him. \u201cThe excisemen are on my heels,\u201d Jamie had said. This must be one, then; an officer of the Crown, charged with the prevention of smuggling and the apprehension of smugglers. What had Jamie said? \u201cThe pillory, transportation, flogging, imprisonment, ear-nailing,\u201d waving an airy hand as though such penalties were the equivalent of a traffic ticket.</p><p>\u201cWhatever are you talking about?\u201d I said, trying to sound puzzled. \u201cAnd for the last time, let go of me!\u201d He couldn\u2019t be alone, I thought. How many others were there around the building?</p><p>\u201cYes, please let go,\u201d said a voice behind me. I saw the exciseman\u2019s eyes widen as he glanced over my shoulder.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby stood on the second stair in rumpled blue silk, a large pistol gripped in both hands. He bobbed his head politely at the excise officer.</p><p>\u201cNot stinking whore,\u201d he explained, blinking owlishly. \u201cHonorable wife.\u201d</p><p>The exciseman, clearly startled by the unexpected appearance of a Chinese, gawked from me to Mr. Willoughby and back again.</p><p>\u201cWife?\u201d he said disbelievingly. \u201cYou say she\u2019s your wife?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby, clearly catching only the salient word, nodded pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cWife,\u201d he said again. \u201cPlease letting go.\u201d His eyes were mere bloodshot slits, and it was apparent to me, if not to the exciseman, that his blood was still approximately 80 proof.</p><p>The exciseman pulled me toward himself and scowled at Mr. Willoughby. \u201cNow, listen here\u2014\u201d he began. He got no further, for Mr. Willoughby, evidently assuming that he had given fair warning, raised the pistol and pulled the trigger.</p><p>There was a loud crack, an even louder shriek, which must have been mine, and the landing was filled with a cloud of gray powder-smoke. The exciseman staggered back against the paneling, a look of intense surprise on his face, and a spreading rosette of blood on the breast of his coat.</p><p>Moving by reflex, I leapt forward and grasped the man under the arms, easing him gently down to the floorboards of the landing. There was a flurry of noise from above, as the inhabitants of the house crowded chattering and exclaiming onto the upper landing, attracted by the shot. Bounding footsteps came up the lower stairs two at a time.</p><p>Fergus burst through what must be the cellar door, a pistol in his hand.</p><p>\u201cMilady,\u201d he gasped, catching sight of me sitting in the corner with the exciseman\u2019s body sprawled across my lap. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything; it\u2019s Jamie\u2019s pet Chinaman.\u201d I nodded briefly toward the stair, where Mr. Willoughby, the pistol dropped unregarded by his feet, had sat down on the step and was now regarding the scene below with a benign and bloodshot eye.</p><p>Fergus said something in French that was too colloquial to translate, but sounded highly uncomplimentary to Mr. Willoughby. He strode across the landing, and reached out a hand to grasp the little Chinaman\u2019s shoulder\u2014or so I assumed, until I saw that the arm he extended did not end in a hand, but in a hook of gleaming dark metal.</p><p>\u201cFergus!\u201d I was so shocked at the sight that I stopped my attempts to stanch the exciseman\u2019s wound with my shawl. \u201cWhat\u2014what\u2014\u201d I said incoherently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, glancing at me. Then, following the direction of my gaze, said, \u201cOh, that,\u201d and shrugged. \u201cThe English. Don\u2019t worry about it, milady, we haven\u2019t time. You, canaille, get downstairs!\u201d He jerked Mr. Willoughby off the stairs, dragged him to the cellar door and shoved him through it, with a callous disregard for safety. I could hear a series of bumps, suggesting that the Chinese was rolling downstairs, his acrobatic skills having temporarily deserted him, but had no time to worry about it.</p><p>Fergus squatted next to me, and lifted the exciseman\u2019s head by the hair. \u201cHow many companions are with you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cTell me quickly, cochon, or I slit your throat!\u201d</p><p>From the evident signs, this was a superfluous threat. The man\u2019s eyes were already glazing over. With considerable effort, the corners of his mouth drew back in a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see...you...burn...in...hell,\u201d he whispered, and with a last convulsion that fixed the smile in a hideous rictus upon his face, he coughed up a startling quantity of bright red foamy blood, and died in my lap.</p><p>More feet were coming up the stairs at a high rate of speed. Jamie charged through the cellar door and barely stopped himself before stepping on the excise officer\u2019s trailing legs. His eyes traveled up the body\u2019s length and rested on my face with horrified amazement.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye done, Sassenach?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot her\u2014the yellow pox,\u201d Fergus put in, saving me the trouble. He thrust the pistol into his belt and offered me his real hand. \u201cCome, milady, you must get downstairs!\u201d</p><p>Jamie forestalled him, bending over me as he jerked his head in the direction of the front hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage here,\u201d he said. \u201cGuard the front, Fergus. The usual signal, and keep your pistol hidden unless there\u2019s need.\u201d</p><p>Fergus nodded and vanished at once through the door to the hall.</p><p>Jamie had succeeded in bundling the corpse awkwardly in the shawl; he lifted it off me, and I scrambled to my feet, greatly relieved to be rid of it, in spite of the blood and other objectionable substances soaking the front of my shift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOoh!

Hold my arm.\u201d</p><p>With the door above shut, I couldn\u2019t see a thing; luckily Jamie seemed able to steer by radar. He led me unerringly past large objects that I bumped in passing, and finally came to a halt. I could smell damp stone, and putting out a hand, felt a rough wall before me.</p><p>Jamie said something loudly in Gaelic. Apparently it was the Celtic equivalent of \u201cOpen Sesame,\u201d for there was a short silence, then a grating noise, and a faint glowing line appeared in the darkness before me. The line widened into a slit, and a section of the wall swung out, revealing a small doorway, made of a wooden framework, upon which cut stones were mounted so as to look like part of the wall.</p><p>The concealed cellar was a large room, at least thirty feet long. Several figures were moving about, and the air was ripely suffocating with the smell of brandy. Jamie dumped the body unceremoniously in a corner, then turned to me.</p> <p>\u201cGod, Sassenach, are ye all right?\u201d The cellar seemed to be lighted with candles, dotted here and there in the dimness. I could just see his face, skin drawn tight across his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little cold,\u201d I said, trying not to let my teeth chatter. \u201cMy shift is soaked with blood. Otherwise I\u2019m all right. I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeanne!\u201d He turned and called toward the far end of the cellar, and one of the figures came toward us, resolving itself into a very worried-looking madam. He explained the situation in a few words, causing the worried expression to grow considerably worse.</p><p>\u201cHorreur!\u201d she said. \u201cKilled? On my premises? With witnesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m afraid so.\u201d Jamie sounded calm. \u201cI\u2019ll manage about it. But in the meantime, ye must go up. He might not have been alone. You\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>His voice held a tone of calm assurance, and he squeezed her arm. The touch seemed to calm her\u2014I hoped that was why he had done it\u2014and she turned to leave.</p> <p>\u201cOh, and Jeanne,\u201d Jamie called after her. \u201cWhen ye come back, can ye bring down some clothes for my wife? If her gown\u2019s not ready, I think Daphne is maybe the right size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClothes?\u201d Madame Jeanne squinted into the shadows where I stood. I helpfully stepped out into the light, displaying the results of my encounter with the exciseman.</p><p>Madame Jeanne blinked once or twice, crossed herself, and turned without a word, to disappear through the concealed doorway, which swung to behind her with a muffled thud.</p><p>I was beginning to shake, as much with reaction as with the cold. Accustomed as I was to emergency, blood, and even sudden death, the events of the morning had been more than a little harrowing. It was like a bad Saturday night in the emergency room.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, putting a hand gently on the small of my back. \u201cWe\u2019ll get ye washed.\u201d His touch worked on me as well as it had on Madame Jeanne; I felt instantly better, if still apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cWashed? In what? Brandy?\u201d</p><p>He gave a slight laugh at that. \u201cNo, water. I can offer ye a bathtub, but I\u2019m afraid it will be cold.\u201d</p><p>It was extremely cold.</p> <p>\u201cWh-wh-where did this water come from?\u201d I asked, shivering. \u201cOff a glacier?\u201d The water gushed out of a pipe set in the wall, normally kept plugged with an insanitary-looking wad of rags, wrapped to form a rough seal around the chunk of wood that served as a plug.</p><p>I pulled my hand out of the chilly stream and wiped it on the shift, which was too far gone for anything to make much difference. Jamie shook his head as he maneuvered the big wooden tub closer to the spout.</p><p>\u201cOff the roof,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere\u2019s a rainwater cistern up there. The guttering pipe runs down the side of the building, and the cistern pipe is hidden inside it.\u201d He looked absurdly proud of himself, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cQuite an arrangement,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you use the water for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo cut the liquor,\u201d he explained. He gestured at the far side of the room, where the shadowy figures were working with notable industry among a large array of casks and tubs. \u201cIt comes in a hundred and eighty degrees above proof. We mix it here wi\u2019 pure water, and recask it for sale to the taverns.\u201d</p><p>He shoved the rough plug back into the pipe, and bent to pull the big tub across the stone floor. \u201cHere, we\u2019ll take it out of the way; they\u2019ll be needing the water.\u201d One of the men was in fact standing by with a small cask clasped in his arms; with no more than a curious glance at me, he nodded to Jamie and thrust the cask beneath the stream of water.</p><p>Behind a hastily arranged screen of empty barrels, I peered dubiously down into the depths of my makeshift tub. A single candle burned in a puddle of wax nearby, glimmering off the surface of the water and making it look black and bottomless. I stripped off, shivering violently, thinking that the comforts of hot water and modern plumbing had seemed a hell of a lot easier to renounce when they were close at hand.</p><p>Jamie groped in his sleeve and pulled out a large handkerchief, at which he squinted dubiously.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s maybe cleaner than your shift,\u201d he said, shrugging. He handed it to me, then excused himself to oversee operations at the other end of the room.</p><p>The water was freezing and so was the cellar, and as I gingerly sponged myself, the icy trickles running down my stomach and thighs brought on small fits of shivering.</p><p>Thoughts of what might be happening overhead did little to ease my feelings of chilly apprehension. Presumably, we were safe enough for the moment, so long as the false cellar wall deceived any searching excisemen.</p><p>But if the wall failed to hide us, our position was all but hopeless. There appeared to be no way out of this room but by the door in the false wall\u2014and if that wall were breached, we would not only be caught red-handed in possession of quite a lot of contraband brandy, but also in custody of the body of a murdered King\u2019s Officer.</p><p>And surely the disappearance of that officer would provoke an intensive search? I had visions of excisemen combing the brothel, questioning and threatening the women, emerging with complete descriptions of myself, Jamie, and Mr. Willoughby, as well as several eyewitness accounts of the murder. Involuntarily, I glanced at the far corner, where the dead man lay beneath his bloodstained shroud, covered with pink and yellow hollyhocks. The Chinaman was nowhere to be seen, having apparently passed out behind the ankers of brandy.</p><p>\u201cHere, Sassenach. Drink this; your teeth are chattering so, you\u2019re like to bite through your tongue.\u201d Jamie had reappeared by my seal hole like a St. Bernard dog, bearing a firkin of brandy.</p><p>\u201cTh-thanks.\u201d I had to drop the washcloth and use both hands to steady the wooden cup so it wouldn\u2019t clack against my teeth, but the brandy helped; it dropped like a flaming coal into the pit of my stomach and sent small curling tendrils of warmth through my frigid extremities as I sipped.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, that\u2019s better,\u201d I said, stopping long enough to gasp for breath. \u201cIs this the uncut version?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would likely kill ye. This is maybe a little stronger than what we sell, though. Finish up and put something on; then ye can have a bit more.\u201d Jamie took the cup from my hand and gave me back the handkerchief washcloth. As I hurriedly finished my chilly ablutions, I watched him from the corner of my eye. He was frowning as he gazed at me, clearly deep in thought. I had imagined that his life was complicated; it hadn\u2019t escaped me that my presence was undoubtedly complicating it a good bit more. I would have given a lot to know what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, Jamie?\u201d I said, watching him sidelong as I swabbed the last of the smudges from my thighs. The water swirled around my calves, disturbed by my movements, and the candlelight lit the waves with sparks, as though the dark blood I had washed from my body now glowed once more live and red in the water.</p><p>The frown vanished momentarily as his eyes cleared and fixed on my face.</p><p>\u201cI am thinking that you\u2019re verra beautiful, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if one has a taste for gooseflesh on a large scale,\u201d I said tartly, stepping out of the tub and reaching for the cup.</p><p>He grinned suddenly at me, teeth flashing white in the dimness of the cellar.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, you\u2019re speaking to the only man in Scotland who has a terrible cockstand at sight of a plucked chicken.\u201d</p><p>I spluttered in my brandy and choked, half-hysterical from tension and terror.</p><p>Jamie quickly shrugged out of his coat and wrapped the garment around me, hugging me close against him as I shivered and coughed and gasped.</p><p>\u201cMakes it hard to pass a poulterer\u2019s stall and stay decent,\u201d he murmured in my ear, briskly rubbing my back through the fabric. \u201cHush, Sassenach, hush now. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I clung to him, shaking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m all right. It\u2019s my fault, though. Mr. Willoughby shot the exciseman because he thought he was making indecent advances to me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted. \u201cThat doesna make it your fault, Sassenach,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cAnd for what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s no the first time the Chinaman\u2019s done something foolish, either. When he\u2019s drink taken, he\u2019ll do anything, and never mind how mad it is.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Jamie\u2019s expression changed as he realized what I had said. He stared down at me, eyes wide. \u201cDid ye say \u2018exciseman,\u2019 Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but let go my shoulders and whirled on his heel, snatching the candle off the cask in passing. Rather than be left in the dark, I followed him to the corner where the corpse lay under its shawl.</p><p>\u201cHold this.\u201d Jamie thrust the candle unceremoniously into my hand and knelt by the shrouded figure, pulling back the stained fabric that covered the face.</p><p>I had seen quite a few dead bodies; the sight was no shock, but it still wasn\u2019t pleasant. The eyes had rolled up beneath half-closed lids, which did nothing to help the generally ghastly effect. Jamie frowned at the dead face, drop-jawed and waxy in the candlelight, and muttered something under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. I had thought I would never be warm again, but Jamie\u2019s coat was not only thick and well-made, it held the remnants of his own considerable body heat. I was still cold, but the shivering had eased.</p><p>\u201cThis isna an exciseman,\u201d Jamie said, still frowning. \u201cI know all the Riding Officers in the district, and the superintending officers, too. But I\u2019ve no seen this fellow before.\u201d With some distaste, he turned back the sodden flap of the coat and groped inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt about gingerly but thoroughly inside the man\u2019s clothing, emerging at last with a small penknife, and a small booklet bound in red paper.</p><p>\u201c\u2018New Testament,\u2019\u201d I read, with some astonishment.</p><p>Jamie nodded, looking up at me with one brow raised. \u201cExciseman or no, it seems a peculiar thing to bring with ye to a kittle-hoosie.\u201d He wiped the little booklet on the shawl, then drew the folds of fabric quite gently back over the face, and rose to his feet, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing in his pockets. Any Customs inspector or exciseman must carry his warrant upon his person at all times, for otherwise he\u2019s no authority to carry out a search of premises or seize goods.\u201d He glanced up, eyebrows raised. \u201cWhy did ye think he was an exciseman?\u201d</p> <p>I hugged the folds of Jamie\u2019s coat around myself, trying to remember what the man had said to me on the landing. \u201cHe asked me whether I was a decoy, and where the madam was. Then he said that there was a reward\u2014a percentage of seized contraband, that\u2019s what he said\u2014and that no one would know but him and me. And you\u2019d said there were excisemen after you,\u201d I added. \u201cSo naturally I thought he was one. Then Mr. Willoughby turned up and things rather went to pot.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, still looking puzzled. \u201cAye, well. I havena got any idea who he is, but it\u2019s a good thing that he isna an exciseman. I thought at first something had come verra badly unstuck, but it\u2019s likely all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnstuck?\u201d</p><p>He smiled briefly. \u201cI\u2019ve an arrangement with the Superintending Customs Officer for the district, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at him. \u201cArrangement?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cWell, bribery then, if ye like to be straight out about it.\u201d He sounded faintly irritated.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt that\u2019s standard business procedure?\u201d I said, trying to sound tactful. One corner of his mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is. Well, in any case, there\u2019s an understanding, as ye might say, between Sir Percival Turner and myself, and to find him sending excise officers into this place would worry me considerably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said slowly, mentally juggling all the half-understood events of the morning, and trying to make a pattern of them. \u201cBut in that case, what did you mean by telling Fergus the excisemen were on your heels? And why has everyone been racing round like chickens with their heads off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d He smiled briefly, and took my arm, turning me away from the corpse at our feet. \u201cWell, it\u2019s an arrangement, as I said. And part of it is that Sir Percival must satisfy his own masters in London, by seizing sufficient amounts of contraband now and again. So we see to it that he\u2019s given the opportunity. Wally and the lads brought down two wagonloads from the coast; one of the best brandy, and the other filled with spiled casks and the punked wine, topped off with a few ankers of cheap swill, just to give it all flavor.</p><p>\u201cI met them just outside the city this morning, as we planned, and then we drove the wagons in, takin\u2019 care to attract the attention of the Riding Officer, who just happened to be passing with a small number of dragoons. They came along and we led them a canty chase through the alleyways, until the time for me and the good tubs to part company wi\u2019 Wally and his load of swill. Wally jumped off his wagon then, and made awa\u2019, and I drove like hell down here, wi\u2019 two or three dragoons following, just for show, like. Looks well in a report, ye ken.\u201d He grinned at me, quoting, \u201c\u2018The smugglers escaped in spite of industrious pursuit, but His Majesty\u2019s valiant soldiers succeeded in capturing an entire wagonload of spirits, valued at sixty pounds, ten shillings.\u2019 You\u2019ll know the sort of thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI expect so,\u201d I said. \u201cThen it was you and the good liquor that was arriving at ten? Madame Jeanne said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cShe was meant to have the cellar door open and the ramp in place at ten sharp\u2014we havena got long to get everything unloaded. She was bloody late this morning; I had to circle round twice to keep from bringing the dragoons straight to the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a bit distracted,\u201d I said, remembering suddenly about the Fiend. I told Jamie about the murder at the Green Owl, and he grimaced, crossing himself.</p><p>\u201cPoor lass,\u201d he said.</p><p>I shuddered briefly at the memory of Bruno\u2019s description, and moved closer to Jamie, who put an arm about my shoulders. He kissed me absently on the forehead, glancing again at the shawl-covered shape on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWell, whoever he was, if he wasna an exciseman, there are likely no more of them upstairs. We should be able to get out of here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Jamie\u2019s coat covered me to the knees, but I felt the covert glances cast from the far end of the room at my bare calves, and was all too uncomfortably aware that I was naked under it. \u201cWill we be going back to the printshop?\u201d What with one thing and another, I didn\u2019t think I wanted to take advantage of Madame Jeanne\u2019s hospitality any longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cMaybe for a bit. I\u2019ll have to think.\u201d Jamie\u2019s tone was abstracted, and I could see that his brow was furrowed in thought. With a brief hug, he released me, and began to walk about the cellar, staring meditatively at the stones underfoot.</p> <p>\u201cEr...what did you do with Ian?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up, looking blank; then his face cleared.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian. I left him making inquiries at the taverns above the Market Cross. I\u2019ll need to remember to meet him, later,\u201d he muttered, as though making a note to himself.</p><p>\u201cI met Young Ian, by the way,\u201d I said conversationally.</p><p>Jamie looked startled. \u201cHe came here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. Looking for you\u2014about a quarter of an hour after you left, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for small mercies!\u201d He rubbed a hand through his hair, looking simultaneously amused and worried. \u201cI\u2019d have had the devil of a time explaining to Ian what his son was doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what he was doing here?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t! He was supposed to be\u2014ah, well, let it be. I canna be worrit about it just now.\u201d He relapsed into thought, emerging momentarily to ask, \u201cDid Young Ian say where he was going, when he left ye?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, gathering the coat around myself, and he nodded, sighed, and took up his slow pacing once more.</p><p>I sat down on an upturned tub and watched him. In spite of the general atmosphere of discomfort and danger, I felt absurdly happy simply to be near him. Feeling that there was little I could do to help the situation at present, I settled myself with the coat wrapped round me, and abandoned myself to the momentary pleasure of looking at him\u2014something I had had no chance to do, in the tumult of events.</p><p>In spite of his preoccupation, he moved with the surefooted grace of a swordsman, a man so aware of his body as to be able to forget it entirely. The men by the casks worked by torchlight; it gleamed on his hair as he turned, lighting it like a tiger\u2019s fur, with stripes of gold and dark.</p><p>I caught the faint twitch as two fingers of his right hand flickered together against the fabric of his breeches, and felt a strange little lurch of recognition in the gesture. I had seen him do that a thousand times as he was thinking, and seeing it now again, felt as though all the time that had passed in our separation was no more than the rising and setting of a single sun.</p><p>As though catching my thought, he paused in his strolling and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be warm enough, Sassenach?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I got off my tub and went to join him in his peregrinations, slipping a hand through his arm. \u201cMaking any progress with the thinking?\u201d</p><p>He laughed ruefully. \u201cNo. I\u2019m thinking of maybe half a dozen things together, and half of them things I canna do anything about. Like whether Young Ian\u2019s where he should be.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him. \u201cWhere he should be? Where do you think he should be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be at the printshop,\u201d Jamie said, with some emphasis. \u201cBut he should ha\u2019 been with Wally this morning, and he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Wally? You mean you knew he wasn\u2019t at home, when his father came looking for him this morning?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his nose with a finger, looking at once irritated and amused. \u201cOh, aye. I\u2019d promised Young Ian I wouldna say anything to his Da, though, until he\u2019d a chance to explain himself. Not that an explanation is likely to save his arse,\u201d he added.</p><p>Young Ian had, as his father said, come to join his uncle in Edinburgh without the preliminary bother of asking his parents\u2019 leave. Jamie had discovered this dereliction fairly quickly, but had not wanted to send his nephew alone back to Lallybroch, and had not yet had time to escort him personally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that he canna look out for himself,\u201d Jamie explained, amusement winning in the struggle of expressions on his face. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice capable lad. It\u2019s just\u2014well, ye ken how things just happen around some folk, without them seeming to have anything much to do wi\u2019 it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, yes,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cI\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>He laughed out loud at that. \u201cGod, you\u2019re right, Sassenach! Maybe that\u2019s why I like Young Ian so well; he \u2019minds me of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reminded me a bit of you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly. \u201cGod, Jenny will maim me, and she hears her baby son\u2019s been loitering about a house of ill repute. I hope the wee bugger has the sense to keep his mouth shut, once he\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he gets home,\u201d I said, thinking of the gawky almost-fifteen-year-old I had seen that morning, adrift in an Edinburgh filled with prostitutes, excisemen, smugglers, and hatchet-wielding Fiends. \u201cAt least he isn\u2019t a girl,\u201d I added, thinking of this last item. \u201cThe Fiend doesn\u2019t seem to have a taste for young boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, there are plenty of others who have,\u201d Jamie said sourly. \u201cBetween Young Ian and you, Sassenach, I shall be lucky if my hair\u2019s not gone white by the time we get out of this stinking cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I said in surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d He dropped my arm and rounded on me, glaring. \u201cI dinna need to worry about ye? Is that what ye said? Christ! I leave ye safely in bed waiting for your breakfast, and not an hour later, I find ye downstairs in your shift, clutching a corpse to your bosom! And now you\u2019re standing in front of me bare as an egg, with fifteen men over there wondering who in hell ye are\u2014and how d\u2019ye think I\u2019m going to explain ye to them, Sassenach? Tell me that, eh?\u201d He shoved a hand through his hair in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cSweet bleeding Jesus! And I\u2019ve to go up the coast in two days without fail, but I canna leave ye in Edinburgh, not wi\u2019 Fiends creepin\u2019 about with hatchets, and half the people who\u2019ve seen ye thinking you\u2019re a prostitute, and...and...\u201d The lacing around his pigtail broke abruptly under the pressure, and his hair fluffed out round his head like a lion\u2019s mane. I laughed. He glared for a moment longer, but then a reluctant grin made its way slowly through the frown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you will,\u201d I said, and stood on tiptoe to brush his hair back behind his ears. Working on the same principle that causes magnets of opposing polarities to snap together when placed in close proximitry, he bent his head and kissed me.</p><p>\u201cI had forgotten,\u201d he said, a moment later.</p><p>\u201cForgotten what?\u201d His back was warm through the thin shirt.</p> <p>\u201cEverything.\u201d He spoke very softly, mouth against my hair. \u201cJoy.

For there is something to be lost, now.\u201d</p><p>I drew back a little, to look up at him. His arms were locked tight around my waist, his eyes dark as bottomless water in the dimness. Then his face changed and he kissed me quickly on the forehead.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Sassenach,\u201d he said, taking me by the arm. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the men you\u2019re my wife. The rest of it will just have to bide.\u201d</p><p>27</p> <p>UP IN FLAMES</p><p>The dress was a trifle lower-cut than necessary, and a bit tight in the bosom, but on the whole, not a bad fit.</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you know Daphne would be the right size?\u201d I asked, spooning up my soup.</p><p>\u201cI said I didna bed wi\u2019 the lasses,\u201d Jamie replied circumspectly. \u201cI never said I didna look at them.\u201d He blinked at me like a large red owl\u2014some congenital tic made him incapable of closing one eye in a wink\u2014and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat gown becomes ye a good deal more than it did Daphne, though.\u201d He cast a glance of general approval at my bosom and waved at a servingmaid carrying a platter of fresh bannocks.</p><p>Moubray\u2019s tavern was doing a thriving dinner business. Several cuts above the snug, smoky atmosphere to be found in The World\u2019s End and similar serious drinking establishments, Moubray\u2019s was a large and elegant place, with an outside stair that ran up to the second floor, where a commodious dining room accommodated the appetites of Edinburgh\u2019s prosperous tradesmen and public officials.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you at the moment?\u201d I asked. \u201cI heard Madame Jeanne call you \u2018Monsieur Fraser\u2019\u2014are you Fraser in public, though?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and broke a bannock into his soup bowl. \u201cNo, at the moment, I\u2019m Sawney Malcolm, Printer and Publisher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawney? That\u2019s a nickname for Alexander, is it? I should have thought \u2018Sandy\u2019 was more like it, especially considering your hair.\u201d Not that his hair was sandy-colored in the least, I reflected, looking at it. It was like Bree\u2019s hair\u2014very thick, with a slight wave to it, and all the colors of red and gold mixed; copper and cinnamon, auburn and amber, red and roan and rufous, all mingled together.</p><p>I felt a sudden wave of longing for Bree; at the same time, I longed to untie Jamie\u2019s hair from its formal plait and run my hands up under it, to feel the solid curve of his skull, and the soft strands tangled in my fingers. I could still recall the tickle of it, spilling loose and rich across my br**sts in the morning light.</p><p>My breath coming a little short, I bent my head to my oyster stew.</p><p>Jamie appeared not to have noticed; he added a large pat of butter to his bowl, shaking his head as he did so.</p><p>\u201cSawney\u2019s what they say in the Highlands,\u201d he informed me. \u201cAnd in the Isles, too. Sandy\u2019s more what ye\u2019d hear in the Lowlands\u2014or from an ignorant Sassenach.\u201d He lifted one eyebrow at me, smiling, and raised a spoonful of the rich, fragrant stew to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cI suppose more to the point, though\u2014who am I?\u201d</p> <p>He had noticed, after all. I felt one large foot nudge mine, and he smiled at me over the rim of his cup.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife, Sassenach,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cAlways. No matter who I may be\u2014you\u2019re my wife.\u201d</p><p>I could feel the flush of pleasure rise in my face, and see the memories of the night before reflected in his own. The tips of his ears were faintly pink.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s too much pepper in this stew?\u201d I asked, swallowing another spoonful. \u201cAre you sure, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, I\u2019m sure,\u201d he amended, \u201cand no, the pepper\u2019s fine. I like a wee bit of pepper.\u201d The foot moved slightly against mine, the toe of his shoe barely brushing my ankle.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d I said, trying out the name on my tongue. The mere fact of saying \u201cMrs.\u201d gave me an absurd little thrill, like a new bride. Involuntarily, I glanced down at the silver ring on my right fourth finger.</p><p>Jamie caught the glance, and raised his cup to me.</p><p>\u201cTo Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d he said softly, and the breathless feeling came back.</p><p>He set down the cup and took my hand; his own was big and so warm that a general feeling of glowing heat spread rapidly through my fingers. I could feel the silver ring, separate from my flesh, its metal heated by his touch.</p><p>\u201cTo have and to hold,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cFrom this day forward,\u201d I said, not caring in the least that we were attracting interested glances from the other diners.</p><p>Jamie bent his head and pressed his lips against the back of my hand, an action that turned the interested glances into frank stares. A clergyman was seated across the room; he glared at us and said something to his companions, who turned round to stare. One was a small, elderly man; the other, I was surprised to see, was Mr. Wallace, my companion from the Inverness coach.</p><p>\u201cThere are private rooms upstairs,\u201d Jamie murmured, blue eyes dancing over my knuckles, and I lost interest in Mr. Wallace.</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t finished your stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn the stew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere comes the servingmaid with the ale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevil take her.\u201d Sharp white teeth closed gently on my knuckle, making me jerk slightly in my seat.</p><p>\u201cPeople are watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them, and I trust they\u2019ve a fine day for it.\u201d</p><p>His tongue flicked gently between my fingers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man in a green coat coming this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell\u2014\u201d Jamie began, when the shadow of the visitor fell upon the table.</p><p>\u201cA good day to you, Mr. Malcolm,\u201d said the visitor, bowing politely. \u201cI trust I do not intrude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d said Jamie, straightening up but keeping his grip on my hand. He turned a cool gaze on the newcomer. \u201cI think I do not know ye, sir?\u201d</p><p>The gentleman, an Englishman of maybe thirty-five, quietly dressed, bowed again, not intimidated by this marked lack of hospitality.</p><p>\u201cI have not had the pleasure of your acquaintance as yet, sir,\u201d he said deferentially. \u201cMy master, however, bade me greet you, and inquire whether you\u2014and your companion\u2014might be so agreeable as to take a little wine with him.\u201d</p><p>The tiny pause before the word \u201ccompanion\u201d was barely discernible, but Jamie caught it. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cMy wife and I,\u201d he said, with precisely the same sort of pause before \u201cwife,\u201d \u201care otherwise engaged at the moment. Should your master wish to speak wi\u2019 me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is Sir Percival Turner who sends to ask, sir,\u201d the secretary\u2014for so he must be\u2014put in quickly. Well-bred as he was, he couldn\u2019t resist a tiny flick of one eyebrow, as one who uses a name he expects to conjure with.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Jamie dryly. \u201cWell, with all respect to Sir Percival, I am preoccupied at present. If you will convey him my regrets?\u201d He bowed, with a politeness so pointed as to come within a hair of rudeness, and turned his back on the secretary. That gentleman stood for a moment, his mouth slightly open, then pivoted smartly on his heel and made his way through the scatter of tables to a door on the far side of the dining room.</p><p>\u201cWhere was I?\u201d Jamie demanded. \u201cOh, aye\u2014to hell wi\u2019 gentlemen in green coats. Now, about these private rooms\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to explain me to people?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He raised one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cExplain what?\u201d He looked me up and down. \u201cWhy must I make excuses for ye? You\u2019re no missing any limbs; you\u2019re not poxed, hunchbacked, toothless or lame\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d I said, kicking him lightly under the table. The lady sitting near the wall nudged her companion and widened her eyes disapprovingly at us. I smiled nonchalantly at them.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cHowever, what wi\u2019 Mr. Willoughby\u2019s activities this morning, and one thing and another, I havena had much chance to think about the matter. Perhaps I\u2019ll just say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear fellow, so you are married! Capital news! Simply capital! My deepest congratulations, and may I be\u2014dare I hope to be?\u2014the first to extend my felicitations and best wishes to your lady?\u201d</p><p>A small, elderly gentleman in a tidy wig leaned heavily on a gold-knobbed stick, beaming genially at us both. It was the little gentleman who had been sitting with Mr. Wallace and the clergyman.</p><p>\u201cYou will pardon the minor discourtesy of my sending Johnson to fetch you earlier, I am sure,\u201d he said deprecatingly. \u201cIt is only that my wretched infirmity prevents rapid movement, as you see.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had risen to his feet at the appearance of the visitor, and with a polite gesture, now drew out a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll join us, Sir Percival?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no indeed! Shouldn\u2019t dream of intruding on your new happiness, my dear sir. Truly, I had no idea\u2014\u201d Still protesting gracefully, he sank down into the proffered chair, wincing as he extended his foot beneath the table.</p><p>\u201cI am a martyr to gout, my dear,\u201d he confided, leaning close enough for me to smell his foul old-man\u2019s breath beneath the wintergreen that spiced his linen.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look corrupt, I thought\u2014breath notwithstanding\u2014but then appearances could be deceiving; it was only about four hours since I had been mistaken for a prostitute.</p><p>Making the best of it, Jamie called for wine, and accepted Sir Percival\u2019s continued effusions with some grace.</p><p>\u201cIt is rather fortunate that I should have encountered you here, my dear fellow,\u201d the elderly gentleman said, breaking off his flowery compliments at last. He laid a small, manicured hand on Jamie\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI had something particular to say to you. In fact, I had sent a note to the printshop, but my messenger failed to find you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Jamie cocked an eyebrow in question.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sir Percival went on. \u201cI believe you had spoken to me\u2014some weeks ago, I scarce recall the occasion\u2014of your intention to travel north on business. A matter of a new press, or something of the sort?\u201d Sir Percival had quite a sweet face, I thought, handsomely patrician despite his years, with large, guileless blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so,\u201d Jamie agreed courteously. \u201cI am invited by Mr. McLeod of Perth, to see a new style of letterpress he\u2019s recently put in use.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Sir Percival paused to remove a snuffbox from his pocket, a pretty thing enameled in green and gold, with cherubs on the lid.</p><p>\u201cI really should not advise a trip to the north just now,\u201d he said, opening the box and concentrating on its contents. \u201cReally I should not. The weather is like to be inclement at this season; I am sure it would not suit Mrs. Malcolm.\u201d Smiling at me like an elderly angel, he inhaled a large pinch of snuff and paused, linen handkerchief at the ready.</p><p>Jamie sipped at his wine, his face blandly composed.</p><p>\u201cI am grateful for your advice, Sir Percival,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll perhaps have received word from your agents of recent storms to the north?\u201d</p> <p>Sir Percival sneezed, a small, neat sound, like a mouse with a cold. He was rather like a white mouse altogether, I thought, seeing him dab daintily at his pointed pink nose.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d he said again, putting away the kerchief and blinking benevolently at Jamie. \u201cNo, I would\u2014as a particular friend with your welfare at heart\u2014most strongly advise that you remain in Edinburgh. After all,\u201d he added, turning the beam of his benevolence on me, \u201cyou surely have an inducement to remain comfortably at home now, do you not? And now, my dear young people, I am afraid I must take my leave; I must not detain you any longer from what must be your wedding breakfast.\u201d</p><p>With a little assistance from the hovering Johnson, Sir Percival got up and tottered off, his gold-knobbed stick tap-tapping on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHe seems a nice old gent,\u201d I remarked, when I was sure he was far enough away not to hear me.</p><p>Jamie snorted. \u201cRotten as a worm-riddled board,\u201d he said. He picked up his glass and drained it. \u201cYe\u2019d think otherwise,\u201d he said meditatively, putting it down and staring after the wizened figure, now cautiously negotiating the head of the stairs. \u201cA man as close as Sir Percival is to Judgment Day, I mean. Ye\u2019d think fear o\u2019 the Devil would prevent him, but not a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose he\u2019s like everyone else,\u201d I said cynically. \u201cMost people think they\u2019re going to live forever.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed, his exuberant spirits returning with a rush.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true,\u201d he said. He pushed my wineglass toward me. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re here, Sassenach, I\u2019m convinced of it. Drink up, mo nighean donn, and we\u2019ll go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPost coitum omne animalium triste est,\u201d I remarked, with my eyes closed.</p><p>There was no response from the warm, heavy weight on my chest, save the gentle sigh of his breathing. After a moment, though, I felt a sort of subterranean vibration, which I interpreted as amusement.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a verra peculiar sentiment, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, his voice blurred with drowsiness. \u201cNot your own, I hope?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stroked the damp bright hair back from his forehead, and he turned his face into the curve of my shoulder, with a small contented snuffle.</p><p>The private rooms at Moubray\u2019s left a bit to be desired in the way of amorous accommodation. Still, the sofa at least offered a padded horizontal surface, which, if you came right down to it, was all that was necessary. While I had decided that I was not past wanting to commit passionate acts after all, I was still too old to want to commit them on the bare floorboards.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who said it\u2014some ancient philosopher or other. It was quoted in one of my medical textbooks; in the chapter on the human reproductive system.\u201d</p><p>The vibration made itself audible as a small chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d seem to have applied yourself to your lessons to good purpose, Sassenach,\u201d he said. His hand passed down my side and wormed its way slowly underneath to cup my bottom. He sighed with contentment, squeezing slightly.</p><p>\u201cI canna think when I have felt less triste,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d I said, tracing the whorl of the small cowlick that lifted the hair from the center of his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me think of it\u2014I rather wondered what led the ancient philosopher to that conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it depends on the sorts of animaliae he\u2019d been fornicating with,\u201d Jamie observed. \u201cMaybe it was just that none o\u2019 them took to him, but he must ha\u2019 tried a fair number, to make such a sweeping statement.\u201d</p> <p>He held tighter to his anchor as the tide of my laughter bounced him gently up and down.</p><p>\u201cMind ye, dogs sometimes do look a trifle sheepish when they\u2019ve done wi\u2019 mating,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMm. And how do sheep look, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, female sheep just go on lookin\u2019 like sheep\u2014not havin\u2019 a great deal of choice in the matter, ye ken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what do the male sheep look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they look fair depraved. Let their tongues hang out, drooling, and their eyes roll back, while they make disgusting noises. Like most male animals, aye?\u201d I could feel the curve of his grin against my shoulder. He squeezed again, and I pulled gently on the ear closest to hand.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice your tongue hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe werena noticing; your eyes were closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear any disgusting noises, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldna just think of any on the spur of the moment,\u201d he admitted. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d</p><p>We laughed softly together, and then were quiet, listening to each other breathe.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said softly at last, smoothing the back of his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so happy.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to one side, shifting his weight carefully so as not to squash me, and lifted himself to lie face-to-face with me.</p><p>\u201cNor me, my Sassenach,\u201d he said, and kissed me, very lightly, but lingering, so that I had time just to close my lips in a tiny bite on the fullness of his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no just the bedding, ye ken,\u201d he said, drawing back a little at last. His eyes looked down at me, a soft deep blue like the warm tropic sea.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, touching his cheek. \u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo have ye with me again\u2014to talk wi\u2019 you\u2014to know I can say anything, not guard my words or hide my thoughts\u2014God, Sassenach,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Lord knows I am lust-crazed as a lad, and I canna keep my hands from you\u2014or anything else\u2014\u201d he added, wryly, \u201cbut I would count that all well lost, had I no more than the pleasure of havin\u2019 ye by me, and to tell ye all my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was lonely without you,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSo lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d he said. He looked down, long lashes hiding his eyes, and hesitated for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI willna say that I have lived a monk,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhen I had to\u2014when I felt that I must or go mad\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laid my fingers against his lips, to stop him.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d I said. \u201cFrank\u2014\u201d</p><p>His own hand pressed gently against my mouth. Both dumb, we looked at each other, and I could feel the smile growing behind my hand, and my own under his, to match it. I took my hand away.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna signify,\u201d he said. He took his hand off my mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I traced the line of his lips with my finger.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me all your heart,\u201d I said. \u201cIf there\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the window to gauge the light\u2014we were to meet Ian at the print shop at five o\u2019clock, to check the progress of the search for Young Ian\u2014and then rolled carefully off me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s two hours, at least, before we must go. Sit up and put your clothes on, and I\u2019ll have them bring some wine and biscuits.\u201d</p><p>This sounded wonderful. I seemed to have been starving ever since I found him. I sat up and began to rummage through the pile of discarded clothes on the floor, looking for the set of stays the low-necked gown required.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no ways sad, but I do maybe feel a bit ashamed,\u201d Jamie observed, wriggling long, slender toes into a silk stocking. \u201cOr I should, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here I am, in paradise, so to speak, wi\u2019 you and wine and biscuits, while Ian\u2019s out tramping the pavements and worrying for his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about Young Ian?\u201d I asked, concentrating on my laces.</p><p>He frowned slightly, pulling on the other stocking.</p><p>\u201cNot so much worried for him, as afraid he may not turn up before tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens tomorrow?\u201d I asked, and then belatedly recalled the encounter with Sir Percival Turner. \u201cOh, your trip to the north\u2014that was supposed to be tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAye, there\u2019s a rendezvous set at Mullin\u2019s Cove, tomorrow being the dark of the moon. A lugger from France, wi\u2019 a load of wine and cambric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sir Percival was warning you not to make that rendezvous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems. What\u2019s happened, I canna say, though I expect I\u2019ll find out. Could be as there\u2019s a visiting Customs Officer in the district, or he\u2019s had word of some activity on the coast there that has nothing to do wi\u2019 us, but could interfere.\u201d He shrugged and finished his last garter.</p><p>He spread out his hands upon his knees then, palm up, and slowly curled the fingers inward. The left curled at once into a fist, compact and neat, a blunt instrument ready for battle. The fingers of his right hand curled more slowly; the middle finger was crooked, and would not lie along the second. The fourth finger would not curl at all, but stuck out straight, holding the little finger at an awkward angle beside it.</p><p>He looked from his hands to me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye remember the night when ye set my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, in my more horrible moments.\u201d That night was one to remember\u2014only because it couldn\u2019t be forgotten. Against all odds, I had rescued him from Wentworth Prison and a death sentence\u2014but not in time to prevent his being cruelly tortured and abused by Black Jack Randall.</p><p>I picked up his right hand and transferred it to my own knee. He let it lie there, warm, heavy and inert, and didn\u2019t object as I felt each finger, pulling gently to stretch the tendons and twisting to see the range of motion in the joints.</p><p>\u201cMy first orthopedic surgery, that was,\u201d I said wryly.</p><p>\u201cHave ye done a great many things like that since?\u201d he asked curiously, looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, a few. I\u2019m a surgeon\u2014but it doesn\u2019t mean then what it means now,\u201d I added hastily. \u201cSurgeons in my time don\u2019t pull teeth and let blood. They\u2019re more like what\u2019s meant now by the word \u2018physician\u2019\u2014a doctor with training in all the fields of medicine, but with a specialty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial, are ye? Well, ye\u2019ve always been that,\u201d he said, grinning. The crippled fingers slid into my palm and his thumb stroked my knuckles. \u201cWhat is it a surgeon does that\u2019s special, then?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, trying to think of the right phrasing. \u201cWell, as best I can put it\u2014a surgeon tries to effect healing...by means of a knife.\u201d</p><p>His long mouth curled upward at the notion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA nice contradiction, that; but it suits ye, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does?\u201d I said, startled.</p><p>He nodded, never taking his eyes off my face. I could see him studying me closely, and wondered self-consciously what I must look like, flushed from lovemaking, with my hair in wild disorder.</p><p>\u201cYe havena been lovelier, Sassenach,\u201d he said, smile growing wider as I reached up to smooth my hair. He caught my hand, and kissed it gently. \u201cLeave your curls be.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, holding my hands trapped while he looked me over, \u201cno, a knife is verra much what you are, now I think of it. A clever-worked scabbard, and most gorgeous to see, Sassenach\u201d\u2014he traced the line of my lips with a finger, provoking a smile\u2014\u201cbut tempered steel for a core...and a wicked sharp edge, I do think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked?\u201d I said, surprised.</p><p>\u201cNot heartless, I don\u2019t mean,\u201d he assured me. His eyes rested on my face, intent and curious. A smile touched his lips. \u201cNo, never that. But you can be ruthless strong, Sassenach, when the need is on ye.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, a little wryly. \u201cI can,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI have seen that in ye before, aye?\u201d His voice grew softer and his grasp on my hand tightened. \u201cBut now I think ye have it much more than when ye were younger. You\u2019ll have needed it often since, no?\u201d</p> <p>I realized quite suddenly why he saw so clearly what Frank had never seen at all.</p><p>\u201cYou have it too,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve needed it. Often.\u201d Unconsciously, my fingers touched the jagged scar that crossed his middle finger, twisting the distal joints.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have wondered,\u201d he said, so low I could scarcely hear him. \u201cWondered often, if I could call that edge to my service, and sheathe it safe again. For I have seen a great many men grow hard in that calling, and their steel decay to dull iron. And I have wondered often, was I master in my soul, or did I become the slave of my own blade?</p><p>\u201cI have thought again and again,\u201d he went on, looking down at our linked hands...\u201cthat I had drawn my blade too often, and spent so long in the service of strife that I wasna fit any longer for human intercourse.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched with the urge to make a remark, but I bit them instead. He saw it, and smiled, a little wryly.</p> <p>\u201cI didna think I should ever laugh again in a woman\u2019s bed, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cOr even come to a woman, save as a brute, blind with need.\u201d A note of bitterness came into his voice.</p><p>I lifted his hand, and kissed the small scar on the back of it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see you as a brute,\u201d I said. I meant it lightly, but his face softened as he looked at me, and he answered seriously.</p><p>\u201cI know that, Sassenach. And it is that ye canna see me so that gives me hope. For I am\u2014and know it\u2014and yet perhaps...\u201d He trailed off, watching me intently.</p><p>\u201cYou have that\u2014the strength. Ye have it, and your soul as well. So perhaps my own may be saved.\u201d</p><p>I had no notion what to say to this, and said nothing for a while, but only held his hand, caressing the twisted fingers and the large, hard knuckles. It was a warrior\u2019s hand\u2014but he was not a warrior, now.</p><p>I turned the hand over and smoothed it on my knee, palm up. Slowly, I traced the deep lines and rising hillocks, and the tiny letter \u201cC\u201d at the base of his thumb; the brand that marked him mine.</p><p>\u201cI knew an old lady in the Highlands once, who said the lines in your hand don\u2019t predict your life; they reflect it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that so, then?\u201d His fingers twitched slightly, but his palm lay still and open.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She said you\u2019re born with the lines of your hand\u2014with a life\u2014but then the lines change, with the things you do, and the person you are.\u201d I knew nothing about palmistry, but I could see one deep line that ran from wrist to midpalm, forking several times.</p><p>\u201cI think that might be the one they call a life-line,\u201d I said. \u201cSee all the forks? I suppose that would mean you\u2019d changed your life a lot, made a lot of choices.\u201d</p><p>He snorted briefly, but with amusement rather than derision.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Well, that\u2019s safe enough to say.\u201d He peered into his palm, leaning over my knee. \u201cI suppose the first fork would be when I met Jack Randall, and the second when I wed you\u2014see, they\u2019re close together, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they are.\u201d I ran my finger slowly along the line, making his fingers twitch slightly as it tickled. \u201cAnd Culloden maybe would be another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d But he did not wish to talk of Culloden. His own finger moved on. \u201cAnd when I went to prison, and came back again, and came to Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd became a printer.\u201d I stopped and looked up at him, brows raised. \u201cHow on earth did you come to be a printer? It\u2019s the last thing I would have thought of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d His mouth widened in a smile. \u201cWell\u2014it was an accident, aye?\u201d</p><p>To start with he had only been looking for a business that would help to conceal and facilitate the smuggling. Possessed of a sizable sum from a recent profitable venture, he had determined to purchase a business whose normal operations involved a large wagon and team of horses, and some discreet premises that could be used for the temporary storage of goods in transit.</p><p>Carting suggested itself, but was rejected precisely because the operations of that business made its practitioners subject to more or less constant scrutiny from the Customs. Likewise, the ownership of a tavern or inn, while superficially desirable because of the large quantities of supplies brought in, was too vulnerable in its legitimate operation to hide an illegitimate one; tax collectors and Customs agents hung about taverns like fleas on a fat dog.</p><p>\u201cI thought of printing, when I went to a place to have some notices made up,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs I was waiting to put in my order, I saw the wagon come rumbling up, all loaded wi\u2019 boxes of paper and casks of alcohol for the ink powder, and I thought, by God, that\u2019s it! For excisemen would never be troubling a place like that.\u201d</p><p>It was only after purchasing the shop in Carfax Close, hiring Geordie to run the press, and actually beginning to fill orders for posters, pamphlets, folios, and books, that the other possibilities of his new business had occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cIt was a man named Tom Gage,\u201d he explained. He loosed his hand from my grasp, growing eager in the telling, gesturing and rubbing his hands through his hair as he talked, disheveling himself with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHe brought in small orders for this or that\u2014innocent stuff, all of it\u2014but often, and stayed to talk over it, taking trouble to talk to me as well as to Geordie, though he must have seen I knew less about the business than he did himself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me wryly.</p><p>\u201cI didna ken much about printing, Sassenach, but I do ken men.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious that Gage was exploring the sympathies of Alexander Malcolm; hearing the faint sibilance of Jamie\u2019s Highland speech, he had prodded delicately, mentioning this acquaintance and that whose Jacobite sympathies had led them into trouble after the Rising, picking up the threads of mutual acquaintance, skillfully directing the conversation, stalking his prey. Until at last, the amused prey had bluntly told him to bring what he wanted made; no King\u2019s man would hear of it.</p><p>\u201cAnd he trusted you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question; the only man who had ever trusted Jamie Fraser in error was Charles Stuart\u2014and in that case, the error was Jamie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d And so an association was begun, strictly business in the beginning, but deepening into friendship as time went on. Jamie had printed all the materials generated by Gage\u2019s small group of radical political writers\u2014from publicly acknowledged articles to anonymous broadsheets and pamphlets filled with material incriminating enough to get the authors summarily jailed or hanged.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d go to the tavern down the street and talk, after the printing was done. I met a few of Tom\u2019s friends, and finally Tom said I should write a small piece myself. I laughed and told him that with my hand, by the time I\u2019d penned anything that could be read, we\u2019d all be dead\u2014of old age, not hanging.</p><p>\u201cI was standing by the press as we were talking, setting the type wi\u2019 my left hand, not even thinking. He just stared at me, and then he started to laugh. He pointed at the tray, and at my hand, and went on laughing, \u2019til he had to sit down on the floor to stop.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out his arms in front of him, flexing his hands and studying them dispassionately. He curled one hand into a fist and bent it slowly up toward his face, making the muscles of his arm ripple and swell under the linen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hale enough,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with luck, may be so for a good many years yet\u2014but not forever, Sassenach. I ha\u2019 fought wi\u2019 sword and dirk many times, but to every warrior comes the day when his strength will fail him.\u201d He shook his head and stretched out a hand toward his coat, which lay on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI took these, that day wi\u2019 Tom Gage, to remind me of it,\u201d he said.</p><p>He took my hand and put into it the things he had taken from his pocket. They were cool, and hard to the touch, small heavy oblongs of lead. I didn\u2019t need to feel the incised ends to know what the letters on the type slugs were.</p><p>\u201cQ.E.D.,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThe English took my sword and dirk away,\u201d he said softly. His finger touched the slugs that lay in my palm. \u201cBut Tom Gage put a weapon into my hands again, and I think I shall not lay it down.\u201d</p><p>We walked arm in arm down the cobbled slope of the Royal Mile at a quarter to five, suffused with a glow engendered by several bowls of well-peppered oyster stew and a bottle of wine, shared at intervals during our \u201cprivate communications.\u201d</p><p>The city glowed all around us, as though sharing our happiness. Edinburgh lay under a haze that would soon thicken to rain again, but for now, the light of the setting sun hung gold and pink and red in the clouds, and shone in the wet patina of the cobbled street, so that the gray stones of the buildings softened and streamed with reflected light, echoing the glow that warmed my cheeks and shone in Jamie\u2019s eyes when he looked at me.</p><p>Drifting down the street in this state of softheaded self-absorption, it was several minutes before I noticed anything amiss. A man, impatient of our meandering progress, stepped briskly around us, and then came to a dead stop just in front of me, making me trip on the wet stones and throw a shoe.</p><p>He flung up his head and stared skyward for a moment, then hurried off down the street, not running, but walking as fast as he could go.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d I said, stooping to retrieve my shoe. Suddenly I noticed that all around us, folk were stopping, staring up, and then starting to rush down the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think\u2014?\u201d I began, but when I turned to Jamie, he too was staring intently upward. I looked up, too, and it took only a moment to see that the red glow in the clouds above was a good deal deeper than the general color of the sunset sky, and seemed to flicker in an uneasy fashion most uncharacteristic of sunsets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFire,\u201d he said. \u201cGod, I think it\u2019s in Leith Wynd!\u201d</p><p>At the same moment, someone farther down the street raised the cry of \u201cFire!\u201d and as though this official diagnosis had given them leave to run at last, the hurrying figures below broke loose and cascaded down the street like a herd of lemmings, anxious to fling themselves into the pyre.</p><p>A few saner souls ran upwards, past us, also shouting \u201cFire!\u201d but presumably with the intent of alerting whatever passed for a fire department.</p><p>Jamie was already in motion, tugging me along as I hopped awkwardly on one foot. Rather than stop, I kicked the other shoe off, and followed him, slipping and stubbing my toes on the cold wet cobbles as I ran.</p> <p>The fire was not in Leith Wynd, but next door, in Carfax Close. The mouth of the close was choked with excited onlookers, shoving and craning in an effort to see, shouting incoherent questions at one another. The smell of smoke struck hot and pungent through the damp evening air, and waves of crackling heat beat against my face as I ducked into the close.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t hesitate, but plunged into the crowd, making a path by main force. I pressed close behind him before the human waves could close again, and elbowed my way through, unable to see anything but Jamie\u2019s broad back ahead of me.</p><p>Then we popped out in the front of the crowd, and I could see all too well. Dense clouds of gray smoke rolled out of both the printshop\u2019s lower windows, and I could hear a whispering, crackling noise that rose above the noise of the spectators as though the fire were talking to itself.</p><p>\u201cMy press!\u201d With a cry of anguish, Jamie darted up the front step and kicked in the door. A cloud of smoke rolled out of the open doorway and engulfed him like a hungry beast. I caught a brief glimpse of him, staggering from the impact of the smoke; then he dropped to his knees and crawled into the building.</p><p>Inspired by this example, several men from the crowd ran up the steps of the printshop, and likewise disappeared into the smoke-filled interior. The heat was so intense that I felt my skirts blow against my legs with the wind of it, and wondered how the men could stand it, there inside.</p> <p>A fresh outbreak of shouting in the crowd behind me announced the arrival of the Town Guard, armed with buckets. Obviously accustomed to this task, the men flung off their wine-red uniform coats and began at once to attack the fire, smashing the windows and flinging pails of water through them with a fierce abandon. Meanwhile, the crowd swelled, its noise augmented by a constant cascade of pattering feet down the many staircases of the close, as families on the upper floors of the surrounding buildings hastily ushered hordes of excited children down to safety.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think that the efforts of the bucket brigade, valiant as they were, would have much effect on what was obviously a fire well underway. I was edging back and forth on the pavement, trying vainly to see anything moving within, when the lead man in the bucket line uttered a startled cry and leaped back, just in time to avoid being crowned by a tray of lead type that whizzed through the broken window and landed on the cobbles with a crash, scattering slugs in all directions.</p><p>Two or three urchins wriggled through the crowd and snatched at the slugs, only to be cuffed and driven off by indignant neighbors. One plump lady in a kertch and apron darted forward, risking life and limb, and took custody of the heavy type-tray, dragging it back to the curb, where she crouched protectively over it like a hen on a nest.</p><p>Before her companions could scoop up the fallen type, though, they were driven back by a hail of objects that rained from both windows: more type trays, roller bars, inking pads, and bottles of ink, which broke on the pavement, leaving big spidery blotches that ran into the puddles spilled by the fire fighters.</p><p>Encouraged by the draft from the open door and windows, the voice of the fire had grown from a whisper into a self-satisfied, chuckling roar. Prevented from flinging water through the windows by the rain of objects being thrown out of them, the leader of the Town Guard shouted to his men, and holding a soaked handkerchief over his nose, ducked and ran into the building, followed by a half-dozen of his fellows.</p><p>The line quickly re-formed, full buckets coming hand to hand round the corner from the nearest pump and up the stoop, excited lads snatching the empty buckets that bounced down the step, to race back with them to the pump for refilling. Edinburgh is a stone city, but with so many buildings crammed cheek by jowl, all equipped with multiple hearths and chimneys, fire must be still a frequent occurrence.</p> <p>Evidently so, for a fresh commotion behind me betokened the belated arrival of the fire engine. The waves of people parted like the Red Sea, to allow passage of the engine, drawn by a team of men rather than horses, which could not have negotiated the tight quarters of the wynds.</p><p>The engine was a marvel of brass, glowing like a coal itself in the reflected flames. The heat was becoming more intense; I could feel my lungs dry and labor with each gulp of hot air, and was terrified for Jamie. How long could he breathe, in that hellish fog of smoke and heat, let alone the danger of the flames themselves?</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary, and Joseph!\u201d Ian, forcing his way through the crowd despite his wooden leg, had appeared suddenly by my elbow. He grabbed my arm to keep his balance as another rain of objects forced the people around us back again.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jamie?\u201d he shouted in my ear.</p><p>\u201cIn there!\u201d I bellowed back, pointing.</p><p>There was a sudden bustle and commotion at the door of the printshop, with a confused shouting that rose even over the sound of the fire. Several sets of legs appeared, shuffling to and fro beneath the emergent plume of smoke that billowed from the door. Six men emerged, Jamie among them, staggering under the weight of a huge piece of bulky machinery\u2014Jamie\u2019s precious printing press. They eased it down the step and pushed it well into the crowd, then turned back to the printshop.</p><p>Too late for any more rescue maneuvers; there was a crash from inside, a fresh blast of heat that sent the crowd scuttling backward, and suddenly the windows of the upper story were lit with dancing flames inside. A small stream of men issued from the building, coughing and choking, some of them crawling, blackened with soot and dampened with the sweat of their efforts. The engine crew pumped madly, but the thick stream of water from their hose made not the slightest impression on the fire.</p><p>Ian\u2019s hand clamped down on my arm like the jaws of a trap.</p> <p>\u201cIan!\u201d he shrieked, loud enough to be heard above the noises of crowd and fire alike.</p><p>I looked up in the direction of his gaze, and saw a wraithlike shape at the second-story window. It seemed to struggle briefly with the sash, and then to fall back or be enveloped in the smoke.</p><p>My heart leapt into my mouth. There was no telling whether the shape was indeed Young Ian, but it was certainly a human form. Ian had lost no time in gaping, but was stumping toward the door of the printshop with all the speed his leg would allow.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I shouted, running after him.</p><p>Jamie was leaning on the printing press, chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath and thank his assistants at the same time.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I snatched at his sleeve, ruthlessly jerking him away from a red-faced barber, who kept excitedly wiping sooty hands on his apron, leaving long black streaks among the smears of dried soap and the spots of blood.</p><p>\u201cUp there!\u201d I shouted, pointing. \u201cYoung Ian\u2019s upstairs!\u201d</p><p>Jamie stepped back, swiping a sleeve across his blackened face, and stared wildly at the upper windows. Nothing was to be seen but the roiling shimmer of the fire against the panes.</p><p>Ian was struggling in the hands of several neighbors who sought to prevent his entering the shop.</p><p>\u201cNo, man, ye canna go in!\u201d the Guard captain cried, trying to grasp Ian\u2019s flailing hands. \u201cThe staircase has fallen, and the roof will go next!\u201d</p><p>Despite his stringy build and the handicap of his leg, Ian was tall and vigorous, and the feeble grasp of his well-meaning Town Guard captors\u2014mostly retired pensioners from the Highland regiments\u2014was no match for his mountain-hardened strength, reinforced as it was by parental desperation. Slowly but surely, the whole confused mass jerked by inches up the steps of the printshop as Ian dragged his would-be rescuers with him toward the flames.</p><p>I felt Jamie draw breath, gulping air as deep as he could with his seared lungs, and then he was up the steps as well, and had Ian round the waist, dragging him back.</p><p>\u201cCome down, man!\u201d he shouted hoarsely. \u201cYe\u2019ll no manage\u2014the stair is gone!\u201d He glanced round, saw me, and thrust Ian bodily backward, off-balance and staggering, into my arms. \u201cHold him,\u201d he shouted, over the roar of the flames. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch down the lad!\u201d</p><p>With that, he turned and dashed up the steps of the adjoining building, pushing his way through the patrons of the ground-floor chocolate shop, who had emerged onto the pavement to gawk at the excitement, pewter cups still clutched in their hands.</p><p>Following Jamie\u2019s example, I locked my arms tight around Ian\u2019s waist and didn\u2019t let go. He made an abortive attempt to follow Jamie, but then stopped and stood rigid in my arms, his heart beating wildly just under my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, pointlessly. \u201cHe\u2019ll do it; he\u2019ll get him out. He will. I know he will.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t answer\u2014might not have heard\u2014but stood still and stiff as a statue in my grasp, breath coming harshly with a sound like a sob. When I released my hold on his waist, he didn\u2019t move or turn, but when I stood beside him, he snatched my hand and held it hard. My bones would have ground together, had I not been squeezing back just as hard.</p><p>It was no more than a minute before the window above the chocolate shop opened and Jamie\u2019s head and shoulders appeared, red hair glowing like a stray tongue of flame escaped from the main fire. He climbed out onto the sill, and cautiously turned, squatting, until he faced the building.</p><p>Rising to his stockinged feet, he grasped the gutter of the roof overhead and pulled, slowly raising himself by the strength of his arms, long toes scrabbling for a grip in the crevices between the mortared stones of the housefront. With a grunt audible even over the sound of fire and crowd, he eeled over the edge of the roof and disappeared behind the gable.</p><p>A shorter man could not have managed. Neither could Ian, with his wooden leg. I heard Ian say something under his breath; a prayer I thought, but when I glanced at him, his jaw was clenched, face set in lines of fear.</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell is he going to do up there?\u201d I thought, and was unaware that I had spoken aloud until the barber, shading his eyes next to me, replied.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a trapdoor built in the roof o\u2019 the printshop, ma\u2019am. Nay doubt Mr. Malcolm means to gain access to the upper story so. Is it his \u2019prentice up there, d\u2019ye know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ian snapped, hearing this. \u201cIt\u2019s my son!\u201d</p><p>The barber shrank back before Ian\u2019s glare, murmuring \u201cOh, aye, just so, sir, just so!\u201d and crossing himself. A shout from the crowd grew into a roar as two figures appeared on the roof of the chocolate shop, and Ian dropped my hand, springing forward.</p><p>Jamie had his arm round Young Ian, who was bent and reeling from the smoke he had swallowed. It was reasonably obvious that neither of them was going to be able to negotiate a return through the adjoining building in his present condition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just then, Jamie spotted Ian below. Cupping his hand around his mouth, he bellowed \u201cRope!\u201d</p><p>Rope there was; the Town Guard had come equipped. Ian snatched the coil from an approaching Guardsman, leaving that worthy blinking in indignation, and turned to face the house.</p><p>I caught the gleam of Jamie\u2019s teeth as he grinned down at his brother-in-law, and the look of answering wryness on Ian\u2019s face. How many times had they thrown a rope between them, to raise hay to the barn loft, or bind a load to the wagon for carrying?</p><p>The crowd fell back from the whirl of Ian\u2019s arm, and the heavy coil flew up in a smooth parabola, unwinding as it went, landing on Jamie\u2019s outstretched arm with the precision of a bumblebee lighting on a flower. Jamie hauled in the dangling tail, and disappeared momentarily, to anchor the rope about the base of the building\u2019s chimney.</p> <p>A few precarious moments\u2019 work, and the two smoke-blackened figures had come to a safe landing on the pavement below. Young Ian, rope slung under his arms and round his chest, stood upright for a moment, then, as the tension of the rope slackened, his knees buckled and he slid into a gangling heap on the cobbles.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right? A bhalaich, speak to me!\u201d Ian fell to his knees beside his son, anxiously trying to unknot the rope round Young Ian\u2019s chest, while simultaneously trying to lift up the lad\u2019s lolling head.</p><p>Jamie was leaning against the railing of the chocolate shop, black in the face and coughing his lungs out, but otherwise apparently unharmed. I sat down on the boy\u2019s other side, and took his head on my lap.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry at the sight of him. When I had seen him in the morning, he had been an appealing-looking lad, if no great beauty, with something of his father\u2019s homely, good-natured looks. Now, at evening, the thick hair over one side of his forehead had been singed to a bleached red stubble, and his eyebrows and lashes had been burned off entirely. The skin beneath was the soot-smeared bright pink of a suckling pig just off the spit.</p><p>I felt for a pulse in the spindly neck and found it, reassuringly strong. His breathing was hoarse and irregular, and no wonder; I hoped the lining of his lungs had not been burned. He coughed, long and rackingly, and the thin body convulsed on my lap.</p> <p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d Ian\u2019s hands instinctively grabbed his son beneath the armpits and sat him up. His head wobbled to and fro, and he pitched forward into my arms.</p><p>\u201cI think so; I can\u2019t tell for sure.\u201d The boy was still coughing, but not fully conscious; I held him against my shoulder like an enormous baby, patting his back futilely as he retched and gagged.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d This time it was Jamie, squatting breathless alongside me. His voice was so hoarse I wouldn\u2019t have recognized it, roughened as it was by smoke.</p><p>\u201cI think so. What about you? You look like Malcolm X,\u201d I said, peering at him over Young Ian\u2019s heaving shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d He put a hand to his face, looking startled, then grinned reassuringly. \u201cNay, I canna say how I look, but I\u2019m no an ex-Malcolm yet; only a wee bit singed round the edges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back, get back!\u201d The Guard captain was at my side, gray beard bristling with anxiety, plucking at my sleeve. \u201cMove yourself, ma\u2019am, the roof\u2019s going!\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, as we scrambled to safety, the roof of the printshop fell in, and an awed sound rose from the watching crowd as an enormous fountain of sparks whirled skyward, brilliant against the darkening sky.</p><p>As though heaven resented this intrusion, the spume of fiery ash was answered by the first pattering of raindrops, plopping heavily on the cobbles all around us. The Edinburghians, who surely ought to have been accustomed to rain by now, made noises of consternation and began to scuttle back into the surrounding buildings like a herd of cockroaches, leaving nature to complete the fire engine\u2019s work.</p><p>A moment later, Ian and I were alone with Young Ian. Jamie, having dispensed money liberally to the Guard and other assistants, and having arranged for his press and its fittings to be housed in the barber\u2019s storeroom, trudged wearily toward us.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the lad?\u201d he asked, wiping a hand down his face. The rain had begun to come down more heavily, and the effect on his soot-blackened countenance was picturesque in the extreme. Ian looked at him, and for the first time, the anger, worry and fear faded somewhat from his countenance. He gave Jamie a lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cHe doesna look a great deal better than ye do yourself, man\u2014but I think he\u2019ll do now. Give us a hand, aye?\u201d</p><p>Murmuring small Gaelic endearments suitable for babies, Ian bent over his son, who was by this time sitting up groggily on the curbstone, swaying to and fro like a heron in a high wind.</p><p>By the time we reached Madame Jeanne\u2019s establishment, Young Ian could walk, though still supported on either side by his father and uncle. Bruno, who opened the door, blinked incredulously at the sight, and then swung the door open, laughing so hard he could barely close it after us.</p><p>I had to admit that we were nothing much to look at, wet through and streaming with rain. Jamie and I were both barefoot, and Jamie\u2019s clothes were in rags, singed and torn and covered with streaks of soot. Ian\u2019s dark hair straggled in his eyes, making him look like a drowned rat with a wooden leg.</p> <p>Young Ian, though, was the focus of attention, as multiple heads came popping out of the drawing room in response to the noise Bruno was making. With his singed hair, swollen red face, beaky nose, and lashless, blinking eyes, he strongly resembled the fledgling young of some exotic bird species\u2014a newly hatched flamingo, perhaps. His face could scarcely grow redder, but the back of his neck flamed crimson, as the sound of feminine giggles followed us up the stairs.</p><p>Safely ensconced in the small upstairs sitting room, with the door closed, Ian turned to face his hapless offspring.</p><p>\u201cGoing to live, are ye, ye wee bugger?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d Young Ian replied in a dismal croak, looking rather as though he wished the answer were \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d his father said grimly. \u201cD\u2019ye want to explain yourself, or shall I just belt hell out of ye now and save us both time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe canna thrash someone who\u2019s just had his eyebrows burnt off, Ian,\u201d Jamie protested hoarsely, pouring out a glass of porter from the decanter on the table. \u201cIt wouldna be humane.\u201d He grinned at his nephew and handed him the glass, which the boy clutched with alacrity.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. Perhaps not,\u201d Ian agreed, surveying his son. One corner of his mouth twitched. Young Ian was a pitiable sight; he was also an extremely funny one. \u201cThat doesna mean ye aren\u2019t going to get your arse blistered later, mind,\u201d he warned the boy, \u201cand that\u2019s besides whatever your mother means to do to ye when she sees ye again. But for now, lad, take your ease.\u201d</p><p>Not noticeably reassured by the magnanimous tone of this last statement, Young Ian didn\u2019t answer, but sought refuge in the depths of his glass of porter.</p><p>I took my own glass with a good deal of pleasure. I had realized belatedly just why the citizens of Edinburgh reacted to rain with such repugnance; once one was wet through, it was the devil to get dry again in the damp confines of a stone house, with no change of clothes and no heat available but a small hearthfire.</p><p>I plucked the damp bodice away from my br**sts, caught Young Ian\u2019s interested glance, and decided regretfully that I really couldn\u2019t take it off with the boy in the room. Jamie seemed to have been corrupting the lad to quite a sufficient extent already. I gulped the porter instead, feeling the rich flavor purl warmingly through my innards.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye feel well enough to talk a bit, lad?\u201d Jamie sat down opposite his nephew, next to Ian on the hassock.</p><p>\u201cAye...I think so,\u201d Young Ian croaked cautiously. He cleared his throat like a bullfrog and repeated more firmly, \u201cAye, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Well, then. First, how did ye come to be in the printshop, and then, how did it come to be on fire?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian pondered that one for a minute, then took another gulp of his porter for courage and said, \u201cI set it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie and Ian both sat up straight at that. I could see Jamie revising his opinion as to the advisability of thrashing people without eyebrows, but he mastered his temper with an obvious effort, and said merely, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The boy took another gulp of porter, coughed, and drank again, apparently trying to decide what to say.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began uncertainly, \u201cthere was a man,\u201d and came to a dead stop.</p><p>\u201cA man,\u201d Jamie prompted patiently when his nephew showed signs of having become suddenly deaf and dumb. \u201cWhat man?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian clutched his glass in both hands, looking deeply unhappy.</p><p>\u201cAnswer your uncle this minute, clot,\u201d Ian said sharply. \u201cOr I\u2019ll take ye across my knee and tan ye right here.\u201d</p><p>With a mixture of similar threats and promptings, the two men managed to extract a more or less coherent story from the boy.</p><p>Young Ian had been at the tavern at Kerse that morning, where he had been told to meet Wally, who would come down from the rendezvous with the wagons of brandy, there to load the punked casks and spoiled wine to be used as subterfuge.</p><p>\u201cTold?\u201d Ian asked sharply. \u201cWho told ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Jamie said, before Young Ian could speak. He waved a hand at his brother-in-law, urging silence. \u201cAye, I kent he was here. We\u2019ll talk about it later, Ian, if ye please. It\u2019s important we know what happened today.\u201d</p><p>Ian glared at Jamie and opened his mouth to disagree, then shut it with a snap. He nodded to his son to go on.</p><p>\u201cI was hungry, ye see,\u201d Young Ian said.</p><p>\u201cWhen are ye not?\u201d his father and uncle said together, in perfect unison. They looked at each other, snorted with sudden laughter, and the strained atmosphere in the room eased slightly.</p><p>\u201cSo ye went into the tavern to have a bite,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, lad, no harm done. And what happened while ye were there?\u201d</p><p>That, it transpired, was where he had seen the man. A small, ratty-looking fellow, with a seaman\u2019s pigtail, and a blind eye, talking to the landlord.</p><p>\u201cHe was askin\u2019 for you, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Young Ian said, growing easier in his speech with repeated applications of porter. \u201cBy your own name.\u201d</p><p>Jamie started, looking surprised. \u201cJamie Fraser, ye mean?\u201d Young Ian nodded, sipping. \u201cAye. But he knew your other name as well\u2014Jamie Roy, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie Roy?\u201d Ian turned a puzzled glance on his brother-in-law, who shrugged impatiently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019m known on the docks. Christ, Ian, ye know what I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do, but I didna ken the wee laddie was helpin\u2019 ye to do it.\u201d Ian\u2019s thin lips pressed tight together, and he turned his attention back to his son. \u201cGo on, lad. I willna interrupt ye again.\u201d</p><p>The seaman had asked the tavernkeeper how best an old seadog, down on his luck and looking for employment, might find one Jamie Fraser, who was known to have a use for able men. The landlord pleading ignorance of that name, the seaman had leaned closer, pushed a coin across the table, and in a lowered voice asked whether the name \u201cJamie Roy\u201d was more familiar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The landlord remaining deaf as an adder, the seaman had soon left the tavern, with Young Ian right behind him.</p><p>\u201cI thought as how maybe it would be good to know who he was, and what he meant,\u201d the lad explained, blinking.</p><p>\u201cYe might have thought to leave word wi\u2019 the publican for Wally,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cStill, that\u2019s neither here nor there. Where did he go?\u201d</p><p>Down the road at a brisk walk, but not so brisk that a healthy boy could not follow at a careful distance. An accomplished walker, the seaman had made his way into Edinburgh, a distance of some five miles, in less than an hour, and arrived at last at the Green Owl tavern, followed by Young Ian, near wilted with thirst from the walk.</p> <p>I started at the name, but didn\u2019t say anything, not wanting to interrupt the story.</p><p>\u201cIt was terrible crowded,\u201d the lad reported. \u201cSomething happened in the morning, and everyone was talking of it\u2014but they shut up whenever they saw me. Anyway, it was the same there.\u201d He paused to cough and clear his throat. \u201cThe seaman ordered drink\u2014brandy\u2014then asked the landlord was he acquainted wi\u2019 a supplier of brandy named Jamie Roy or Jamie Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he, then?\u201d Jamie murmured. His gaze was intent on his nephew, but I could see the thoughts working behind his high forehead, making a small crease between his thick brows.</p><p>The man had gone methodically from tavern to tavern, dogged by his faithful shadow, and in each establishment had ordered brandy and repeated his question.</p><p>\u201cHe must have a rare head, to be drinkin\u2019 that much brandy,\u201d Ian remarked.</p> <p>Young Ian shook his head. \u201cHe didna drink it. He only smelt it.\u201d</p><p>His father clicked his tongue at such a scandalous waste of good spirit, but Jamie\u2019s red brows climbed still higher.</p><p>\u201cDid he taste any of it?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cAye. At the Dog and Gun, and again at the Blue Boar. He had nay more than a wee taste, though, and then left the glass untouched. He didna drink at all at the other places, and we went to five o\u2019 them, before...\u201d He trailed off, and took another drink.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face underwent an astonishing transformation. From an expression of frowning puzzlement, his face went completely blank, and then resolved itself into an expression of revelation.</p><p>\u201cIs that so, now,\u201d he said softly to himself. \u201cIndeed.\u201d His attention came back to his nephew. \u201cAnd then what happened, lad?\u201d</p> <p>Young Ian was beginning to look unhappy again. He gulped, the tremor visible all the way down his skinny neck.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a terrible long way from Kerse to Edinburgh,\u201d he began, \u201cand a terrible dry walk, too...\u201d</p><p>His father and uncle exchanged jaundiced glances.</p><p>\u201cYe drank too much,\u201d Jamie said, resigned.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didna ken he was going to so many taverns, now, did I?\u201d Young Ian cried in self-defense, going pink in the ears.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not, lad,\u201d Jamie said kindly, smothering the beginning of Ian\u2019s more censorious remarks. \u201cHow long did ye last?\u201d</p><p>Until midway down the Royal Mile, it turned out, where Young Ian, overcome by the cumulation of early rising, a five-mile walk, and the effects of something like two quarts of ale, had dozed off in a corner, waking an hour later to find his quarry long gone.</p><p>\u201cSo I came here,\u201d he explained. \u201cI thought as how Uncle Jamie should know about it. But he wasna here.\u201d The boy glanced at me, and his ears grew still pinker.</p> <p>\u201cAnd just why did ye think he should be here?\u201d Ian favored his offspring with a gimlet eye, which then swiveled to his brother-in-law. The simmering anger Ian had been holding in check since the morning suddenly erupted. \u201cThe filthy gall of ye, Jamie Fraser, takin\u2019 my son to a bawdy house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fine one you are to talk, Da!\u201d Young Ian was on his feet, swaying a bit, but with his big, bony hands clenched at his sides.</p><p>\u201cMe? And what d\u2019ye mean by that, ye wee gomerel?\u201d Ian cried, his eyes going wide with outrage.</p><p>\u201cI mean you\u2019re a damned hypocrite!\u201d his son shouted hoarsely. \u201cPreachin\u2019 to me and Michael about purity and keepin\u2019 to one woman, and all the time ye\u2019re slinkin\u2019 about the city, sniffin\u2019 after whores!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ian\u2019s face had gone entirely purple. I looked in some alarm to Jamie, who appeared to be finding something funny in the present situation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a...a...goddamned whited sepulchre!\u201d Young Ian came up with the simile triumphantly, then paused as though trying to think of another to equal it. His mouth opened, though nothing emerged but a soft belch.</p><p>\u201cThat boy is rather drunk,\u201d I said to Jamie.</p><p>He picked up the decanter of porter, eyed the level within, and set it down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI should ha\u2019 noticed sooner, but it\u2019s hard to tell, scorched as he is.\u201d</p><p>The elder Ian wasn\u2019t drunk, but his expression strongly resembled his offspring\u2019s, what with the suffused countenance, popping eyes, and straining neck cords.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody, stinking hell d\u2019ye mean by that, ye whelp?\u201d he shouted. He moved menacingly toward Young Ian, who took an involuntary step backward and sat down quite suddenly as his calves met the edge of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d he said, startled into monosyllables. He pointed at me, to make it clear. \u201cHer! You deceivin\u2019 my Mam wi\u2019 this filthy whore, that\u2019s what I mean!\u201d</p><p>Ian fetched his son a clout over the ear that knocked him sprawling on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cYe great clot!\u201d he said, scandalized. \u201cA fine way to speak o\u2019 your auntie Claire, to say nothing o\u2019 me and your Mam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt?\u201d Young Ian gawped at me from the cushions, looking so like a nestling begging for food that I burst out laughing despite myself.</p><p>\u201cYou left before I could introduce myself this morning,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re dead,\u201d he said stupidly.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I assured him. \u201cUnless I\u2019ve caught pneumonia from sitting here in a damp dress.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had grown perfectly round as he stared at me. Now a fugitive gleam of excitement came into them.</p><p>\u201cSome o\u2019 the auld women at Lallybroch say ye were a wisewoman\u2014a white lady, or maybe even a fairy. When Uncle Jamie came home from Culloden without ye, they said as how ye\u2019d maybe gone back to the fairies, where ye maybe came from. Is that true? D\u2019ye live in a dun?\u201d</p><p>I exchanged a glance with Jamie, who rolled his eyes toward the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI...er, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe escaped to France after Culloden,\u201d Ian broke in suddenly, with great firmness. \u201cShe thought your uncle Jamie was killed in the battle, so she went to her kin in France. She\u2019d been one of Prince Tearlach\u2019s particular friends\u2014she couldna come back to Scotland after the war without puttin\u2019 herself in sore danger. But then she heard of your uncle, and as soon as she kent that her husband wasna deid after all, she took ship at once and came to find him.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s mouth hung open slightly. So did mine.</p><p>\u201cEr, yes,\u201d I said, closing it. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p><p>The lad turned large, shining eyes from me to his uncle.</p><p>\u201cSo ye\u2019ve come back to him,\u201d he said happily. \u201cGod, that\u2019s romantic!\u201d</p><p>The tension of the moment was broken. Ian hesitated, but his eyes softened as he looked from Jamie to me.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, and smiled reluctantly. \u201cAye, I suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didna expect to be doing this for him for a good two or three years yet,\u201d Jamie remarked, holding his nephew\u2019s head with an expert hand as Young Ian retched painfully into the spittoon I was holding.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, he\u2019s always been forward,\u201d Ian answered resignedly. \u201cLearnt to walk before he could stand, and was forever tumblin\u2019 into the fire or the washpot or the pigpen or the cowbyre.\u201d He patted the skinny, heaving back. \u201cThere, lad, let it come.\u201d</p><p>A little more, and the lad was deposited in a wilted heap on the sofa, there to recover from the effects of smoke, emotion, and too much porter under the censoriously mingled gaze of uncle and father.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that damn tea I sent for?\u201d Jamie reached impatiently for the bell, but I stopped him. The brothel\u2019s domestic arrangements were evidently still disarranged from the excitements of the morning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go down and fetch it.\u201d I scooped up the spittoon and carried it out with me at arm\u2019s length, hearing Ian say behind me, in a reasonable tone of voice, \u201cLook, fool\u2014\u201d</p><p>I found my way to the kitchen with no difficulty, and obtained the necessary supplies. I hoped Jamie and Ian would give the boy a few minutes\u2019 respite; not only for his own sake, but so that I would miss nothing of his story.</p><p>I had clearly missed something; when I returned to the small sitting room, an air of constraint hung over the room like a cloud, and Young Ian glanced up and then quickly away to avoid my eye. Jamie was his usual imperturbable self, but the elder Ian looked almost as flushed and uneasy as his son. He hurried forward to take the tray from me, murmuring thanks, but would not meet my eye.</p><p>I raised one eyebrow at Jamie, who gave me a slight smile and a shrug. I shrugged back and picked up one of the bowls on the tray.</p><p>\u201cBread and milk,\u201d I said, handing it to Young Ian, who at once looked happier.</p><p>\u201cHot tea,\u201d I said, handing the pot to his father.</p><p>\u201cWhisky,\u201d I said, handing the bottle to Jamie, \u201cand cold tea for the burns.\u201d I whisked the lid off the last bowl, in which a number of napkins were soaking in cold tea.</p><p>\u201cCold tea?\u201d Jamie\u2019s ruddy brows lifted. \u201cDid the cook have no butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t put butter on burns,\u201d I told him. \u201cAloe juice, or the juice of a plantain or plantago, but the cook didn\u2019t have any of that. Cold tea is the best we could manage.\u201d</p><p>I poulticed Young Ian\u2019s blistered hands and forearms and blotted his scarlet face gently with the tea-soaked napkins while Jamie and Ian did the honors with teapot and whisky bottle, after which we all sat down, somewhat restored, to hear the rest of Ian\u2019s story.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he began, \u201cI walked about the city for a bit, tryin\u2019 to think what best to do. And finally my head cleared a bit, and I reasoned that if the man I\u2019d been following was goin\u2019 from tavern to tavern down the High Street, if I went to the other end and started up the street, I could maybe find him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a bright thought,\u201d Jamie said, and Ian nodded approvingly, the frown lifting a bit from his face. \u201cDid ye find him?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian nodded, slurping a bit. \u201cI did, then.\u201d</p><p>Running down the Royal Mile nearly to the Palace of Holyrood at the foot, he had toiled his way painstakingly up the street, stopping at each tavern to inquire for the man with the pigtail and one eye. There was no word of his quarry anywhere below the Canongate, and he was beginning to despair of his idea, when suddenly he had seen the man himself, sitting in the taproom of the Holyrood Brewery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Presumably this stop was for respite, rather than information, for the seaman was sitting at his ease, drinking beer. Young Ian had darted behind a hogshead in the yard, and remained there, watching, until at length the man rose, paid his score, and made his leisurely way outside.</p><p>\u201cHe didna go to any more taverns,\u201d the boy reported, wiping a stray drop of milk off his chin. \u201cHe went straight to Carfax Close, to the printshop.\u201d</p><p>Jamie said something in Gaelic under his breath. \u201cDid he? And what then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he found the shop shut up, of course. When he saw the door was locked, he looked careful like, up at the windows, as though he was maybe thinking of breaking in. But then I saw him look about, at all the folk coming and going\u2014it was a busy time of day, wi\u2019 all the folk coming to the chocolate shop. So he stood on the stoop a moment, thinking, and then he set off back up the close\u2014I had to duck into the tailor\u2019s shop on the corner so as not to be seen.\u201d</p> <p>The man had paused at the entrance of the close, then, making up his mind, had turned to the right, gone down a few paces, and disappeared into a small alley.</p><p>\u201cI kent as how the alley led up to the court at the back of the close,\u201d Young Ian explained. \u201cSo I saw at once what he meant to be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a wee court at the back of the close,\u201d Jamie explained, seeing my puzzled look. \u201cIt\u2019s for rubbish and deliveries and such\u2014but there\u2019s a back door out of the printshop opens onto it.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian nodded, putting down his empty bowl. \u201cAye. I thought it must be that he meant to get into the place. And I thought of the new pamphlets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jamie said. He looked a little pale.</p> <p>\u201cPamphlets?\u201d Ian raised his brows at Jamie. \u201cWhat kind of pamphlets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new printing for Mr. Gage,\u201d Young Ian explained.</p><p>Ian still looked as blank as I felt.</p><p>\u201cPolitics,\u201d Jamie said bluntly. \u201cAn argument for repeal of the last Stamp Act\u2014with an exhortation to civil opposition\u2014by violence, if necessary. Five thousand of them, fresh-printed, stacked in the back room. Gage was to come round and get them in the morning, tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ian said. He had gone even paler than Jamie, at whom he stared in a sort of mingled horror and awe. \u201cHave ye gone straight out o\u2019 your mind?\u201d he inquired. \u201cYou, wi\u2019 not an inch on your back unscarred? Wi\u2019 the ink scarce dry on your pardon for treason? You\u2019re mixed up wi\u2019 Tom Gage and his seditious society, and got my son involved as well?\u201d</p><p>His voice had been rising throughout, and now he sprang to his feet, fists clenched.</p> <p>\u201cHow could ye do such a thing, Jamie\u2014how? Have we not suffered enough for your actions, Jenny and me? All through the war and after\u2014Christ, I\u2019d think you\u2019d have your fill of prisons and blood and violence!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Jamie said shortly. \u201cI\u2019m no part of Gage\u2019s group. But my business is printing, aye? He paid for those pamphlets.\u201d</p><p>Ian threw up his hands in a gesture of vast irritation. \u201cOh, aye! And that will mean a great deal when the Crown\u2019s agents arrest ye and take ye to London to be hangit! If those things were to be found on your premises\u2014\u201d Struck by a sudden thought, he stopped and turned to his son.</p><p>\u201cOh, that was it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYe kent what those pamphlets were\u2014that\u2019s why ye set them on fire?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian nodded, solemn as a young owl.</p><p>\u201cI couldna move them in time,\u201d he said. \u201cNot five thousand. The man\u2014the seaman\u2014he\u2019d broke out the back window, and he was reachin\u2019 in for the doorlatch.\u201d</p><p>Ian whirled back to face Jamie.</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d he said violently. \u201cDamn ye for a reckless, harebrained fool, Jamie Fraser! First the Jacobites, and now this!\u201d</p> <p>Jamie had flushed up at once at Ian\u2019s words, and his face grew darker at this.</p><p>\u201cAm I to blame for Charles Stuart?\u201d he said. His eyes flashed angrily and he set his teacup down with a thump that sloshed tea and whisky over the polished tabletop. \u201cDid I not try all I could to stop the wee fool? Did I not give up everything in that fight\u2014everything, Ian! My land, my freedom, my wife\u2014to try to save us all?\u201d He glanced at me briefly as he spoke, and I caught one very small quick glimpse of just what the last twenty years had cost him.</p><p>He turned back to Ian, his brows lowering as he went on, voice growing hard.</p><p>\u201cAnd as for what I\u2019ve cost your family\u2014what have ye profited, Ian? Lallybroch belongs to wee James now, no? To your son, not mine!\u201d</p><p>Ian flinched at that. \u201cI never asked\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cNo, ye didn\u2019t. I\u2019m no accusing ye, for God\u2019s sake! But the fact\u2019s there\u2014Lallybroch\u2019s no mine anymore, is it? My father left it to me, and I cared for it as best I could\u2014took care o\u2019 the land and the tenants\u2014and ye helped me, Ian.\u201d His voice softened a bit. \u201cI couldna have managed without you and Jenny. I dinna begrudge deeding it to Young Jamie\u2014it had to be done. But still...\u201d He turned away for a moment, head bowed, broad shoulders knotted tight beneath the linen of his shirt.</p><p>I was afraid to move or speak, but I caught Young Ian\u2019s eye, filled with infinite distress. I put a hand on his skinny shoulder for mutual reassurance, and felt the steady pounding of the pulse in the tender flesh above his collarbone. He set his big, bony paw on my hand and held on tight.</p><p>Jamie turned back to his brother-in-law, struggling to keep his voice and temper under control. \u201cI swear to ye, Ian, I didna let the lad be put in danger. I kept him out of the way so much as I possibly could\u2014didna let the shoremen see him, or let him go out on the boats wi\u2019 Fergus, hard as he begged me.\u201d He glanced at Young Ian and his expression changed, to an odd mixture of affection and irritation.</p><p>\u201cI didna ask him to come to me, Ian, and I told him he must go home again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe didna make him go, though, did you?\u201d The angry color was fading from Ian\u2019s face, but his soft brown eyes were still narrow and bright with fury. \u201cAnd ye didna send word, either. For God\u2019s sake, Jamie, Jenny hasna slept at night anytime this month!\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s lips pressed tight. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, letting the words escape one at a time. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t. I\u2014\u201d He glanced at the boy again, and shrugged uncomfortably, as though his shirt had grown suddenly too tight.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said again. \u201cI meant to take him home myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old enough to travel by himself,\u201d Ian said shortly. \u201cHe got here alone, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. It wasna that.\u201d Jamie turned aside restlessly, picking up a teacup and rolling it to and fro between his palms. \u201cNo, I meant to take him, so that I could ask your permission\u2014yours and Jenny\u2019s\u2014for the lad to come live wi\u2019 me for a time.\u201d</p><p>Ian uttered a short, sarcastic laugh. \u201cOh, aye! Give our permission for him to be hangit or transported alongside you, eh?\u201d</p><p>The anger flashed across Jamie\u2019s features again as he looked up from the cup in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYe know I wouldna let any harm come to him,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Ian, I care for the lad as though he were my own son, and well ye ken it, too!\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s breath was coming fast; I could hear it from my place behind the sofa. \u201cOh, I ken it well enough,\u201d he said, staring hard into Jamie\u2019s face. \u201cBut he\u2019s not your son, aye? He\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared back for a long moment, then reached out and gently set the teacup back on the table. \u201cAye,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>Ian stood for a moment, breathing hard, then wiped a hand carelessly across his forehead, pushing back the thick dark hair.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said. He took one or two deep breaths, and turned to his son.</p><p>\u201cCome along, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve a room at Halliday\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s bony fingers tightened on mine. His throat worked, but he didn\u2019t move to rise from his seat.</p><p>\u201cNo, Da,\u201d he said. His voice quivered, and he blinked hard, not to cry. \u201cI\u2019m no going wi\u2019 ye.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s face went quite pale, with a deep red patch over the angular cheekbones, as though someone had slapped him hard on both cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d he said.</p><p>Young Ian nodded, swallowing. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll go wi\u2019 ye in the morning, Da; I\u2019ll go home wi\u2019 ye. But not now.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked at his son for a long moment without speaking. Then his shoulders slumped, and all the tension went out of his body.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWell, then. Well.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he turned and left, closing the door very carefully behind him. I could hear the awkward thump of his wooden leg on each step, as he made his way down the stair. There was a brief sound of shuffling as he reached the bottom, then Bruno\u2019s voice in farewell, and the thud of the main door shutting. And then there was no sound in the room but the hiss of the hearthfire behind me.</p><p>The boy\u2019s shoulder was shaking under my hand, and he was holding tighter than ever to my fingers, crying without making a sound.</p><p>Jamie came slowly to sit beside him, his face full of troubled helplessness.</p><p>\u201cIan, oh, wee Ian,\u201d he said. \u201cChrist, laddie, ye shouldna have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to.\u201d Ian gasped and gave a sudden snuffle, and I realized that he had been holding his breath. He turned a scorched countenance on his uncle, raw features contorted in anguish.</p><p>\u201cI didna want to hurt Da,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Jamie patted his knee absently. \u201cI know, laddie,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to say such a thing to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldna tell him, though, and I had to tell you, Uncle Jamie!\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced up, suddenly alert at his nephew\u2019s tone.</p><p>\u201cTell me? Tell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man. The man wi\u2019 the pigtail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian licked his lips, steeling himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I kilt him,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Startled, Jamie glanced at me, then back at Young Ian.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell...I lied a bit,\u201d Ian began, voice trembling. The tears were still welling in his eyes, but he brushed them aside. \u201cWhen I went into the printshop\u2014I had the key ye gave me\u2014the man was already inside.\u201d</p><p>The seaman had been in the backmost room of the shop, where the stacks of newly printed orders were kept, along with the stocks of fresh ink, the blotting papers used to clean the press, and the small forge where worn slugs were melted down and recast into fresh type.</p><p>\u201cHe was taking some o\u2019 the pamphlets from the stack, and putting them inside his jacket,\u201d Ian said, gulping. \u201cWhen I saw him, I screeched at him to put them back, and he whirled round at me wi\u2019 a pistol in his hand.\u201d</p><p>The pistol had discharged, scaring Young Ian badly, but the ball had gone wild. Little daunted, the seaman had rushed at the boy, raising the pistol to club him instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere was no time to run, or to think,\u201d he said. He had let go my hand by now, and his fingers twisted together upon his knee. \u201cI reached out for the first thing to hand and threw it.\u201d</p><p>The first thing to hand had been the lead-dipper, the long-handled copper ladle used to pour molten lead from the melting pot into the casting molds. The forge had been still alight, though well-banked, and while the melting pot held no more than a small puddle, the scalding drops of lead had flown from the dipper into the seaman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cGod, how he screamed!\u201d A strong shudder ran through Young Ian\u2019s slender frame, and I came round the end of the sofa to sit next to him and take both his hands.</p><p>The seaman had reeled backward, clawing at his face, and upset the small forge, knocking live coals everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cThat was what started the fire,\u201d the boy said. \u201cI tried to beat it out, but it caught the edge of the fresh paper, and all of a sudden, something went whoosh! in my face, and it was as though the whole room was alight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe barrels of ink, I suppose,\u201d Jamie said, as though to himself. \u201cThe powder\u2019s dissolved in alcohol.\u201d</p><p>The sliding piles of flaming paper fell between Young Ian and the back door, a wall of flame that billowed black smoke and threatened to collapse upon him. The seaman, blinded and screaming like a banshee, had been on his hands and knees between the boy and the door into the front room of the printshop and safety.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I couldna bear to touch him, to push him out o\u2019 the way,\u201d he said, shuddering again.</p><p>Losing his head completely, he had run up the stairs instead, but then found himself trapped as the flames, racing through the back room and drawing up the stair like a chimney, rapidly filled the upper room with blinding smoke.</p> <p>\u201cDid ye not think to climb out the trapdoor onto the roof?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>Young Ian shook his head miserably. \u201cI didna ken it was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was it there?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>Jamie gave me the flicker of a smile. \u201cIn case of need. It\u2019s a foolish fox has but one exit to his bolthole. Though I must say, it wasna fire I was thinking of when I had it made.\u201d He shook his head, ridding himself of the distraction.</p><p>\u201cBut ye think the man didna escape the fire?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI dinna see how he could,\u201d Young Ian answered, beginning to sniffle again. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s dead, then I killed him. I couldna tell Da I was a m-mur\u2014mur\u2014\u201d He was crying again, too hard to get the word out.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re no a murderer, Ian,\u201d Jamie said firmly. He patted his nephew\u2019s shaking shoulder. \u201cStop now, it\u2019s all right\u2014ye havena done wrong, laddie. Ye haven\u2019t, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d</p><p>The boy gulped and nodded, but couldn\u2019t stop crying or shaking. At last I put my arms around him, turned him and pulled his head down onto my shoulder, patting his back and making the sort of small soothing noises one makes to little children.</p><p>He felt very odd in my arms; nearly as big as a full-grown man, but with fine, light bones, and so little flesh on them that it was like holding a skeleton. He was talking into the depths of my bosom, his voice so disjointed by emotion and muffled by fabric that it was difficult to make out the words.</p><p>\u201c...mortal sin...\u201d he seemed to be saying, \u201c...damned to hell...couldna tell Da...afraid...canna go home ever...\u201d</p><p>Jamie raised his brows at me, but I only shrugged helplessly, smoothing the thick, bushy hair on the back of the boy\u2019s head. At last Jamie leaned forward, took him firmly by the shoulders and sat him up.</p><p>\u201cLook ye, Ian,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, look\u2014look at me!\u201d</p><p>By dint of supreme effort, the boy straightened his drooping neck and fixed brimming, red-rimmed eyes on his uncle\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNow then.\u201d Jamie took hold of his nephew\u2019s hands and squeezed them lightly. \u201cFirst\u2014it\u2019s no a sin to kill a man that\u2019s trying to kill you. The Church allows ye to kill if ye must, in defense of yourself, your family, or your country. So ye havena committed mortal sin, and you\u2019re no damned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Young Ian sniffed mightily, and mopped at his face with a sleeve.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Jamie let the hint of a smile show in his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together and call on Father Hayes in the morning, and ye\u2019ll make your confession and be absolved then, but he\u2019ll tell ye the same as I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The syllable held profound relief, and Young Ian\u2019s scrawny shoulders rose perceptibly, as though a burden had rolled off of them.</p><p>Jamie patted his nephew\u2019s knee again. \u201cFor the second thing, ye needna fear telling your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Young Ian had accepted Jamie\u2019s word on the state of his soul without hesitation, but sounded profoundly dubious about this secular opinion.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll not say he\u2019ll no be upset,\u201d Jamie added fairly. \u201cIn fact, I expect it will turn the rest of his hair white on the spot. But he\u2019ll understand. He isna going to cast ye out or disown ye, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re scairt of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll understand?\u201d Young Ian looked at Jamie with eyes in which hope battled with doubt. \u201cI\u2014I didna think he...has my Da ever killed a man?\u201d he asked suddenly.</p><p>Jamie blinked, taken aback by the question. \u201cWell,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI suppose\u2014I mean, he\u2019s fought in battle, but I\u2014to tell ye the truth, Ian, I dinna ken.\u201d He looked a little helplessly at his nephew.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no the sort of thing men talk much about, aye? Except sometimes soldiers, when they\u2019re deep in drink.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian nodded, absorbing this, and sniffed again, with a horrid gurgling noise. Jamie, groping hastily in his sleeve for a handkerchief, looked up suddenly, struck by a thought.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why ye said ye must tell me, but not your Da? Because ye knew I\u2019ve killed men before?\u201d</p><p>His nephew nodded, searching Jamie\u2019s face with troubled, trusting eyes. \u201cAye. I thought...I thought ye\u2019d know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jamie drew a deep breath, and exchanged a glance with me. \u201cWell...\u201d His shoulders braced and broadened, and I could see him accept the burden Young Ian had laid down. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat ye do,\u201d he said, \u201cis first to ask yourself if ye had a choice. You didn\u2019t, so put your mind at ease. Then ye go to confession, if ye can; if not, say a good Act of Contrition\u2014that\u2019s good enough, when it\u2019s no a mortal sin. Ye harbor no fault, mind,\u201d he said earnestly, \u201cbut the contrition is because ye greatly regret the necessity that fell on ye. It does sometimes, and there\u2019s no preventing it.</p><p>\u201cAnd then say a prayer for the soul of the one you\u2019ve killed,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat he may find rest, and not haunt ye. Ye ken the prayer called Soul Peace? Use that one, if ye have leisure to think of it. In a battle, when there is no time, use Soul Leading\u2014\u2018Be this soul on Thine arm, O Christ, Thou King of the City of Heaven, Amen.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe this soul on Thine arm, O Christ, Thou King of the City of Heaven, Amen,\u201d Young Ian repeated under his breath. He nodded slowly. \u201cAye, all right. And then?\u201d</p><p>Jamie reached out and touched his nephew\u2019s cheek with great gentleness. \u201cThen ye live with it, laddie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>28</p><p>VIRTUE\u2019S GUARDIAN</p><p>\u201cYou think the man Young Ian followed has something to do with Sir Percival\u2019s warning?\u201d I lifted a cover on the supper tray that had just been delivered and sniffed appreciatively; it seemed a very long time since Moubray\u2019s stew.</p><p>Jamie nodded, picking up a sort of hot stuffed roll.</p><p>\u201cI should be surprised if he had not,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cWhile there\u2019s likely more than one man willing to do me harm, I canna think it likely that gangs o\u2019 them are roaming about Edinburgh.\u201d He took a bite and chewed industriously, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNay, that\u2019s clear enough, and nothing to be greatly worrit over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d I took a small bite of my own roll, then a bigger one. \u201cThis is delicious. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie lowered the roll he had been about to take a bite of, and squinted at it. \u201cPigeon minced wi\u2019 truffles,\u201d he said, and stuffed it into his mouth whole.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and paused to swallow. \u201cNo,\u201d he said again, more clearly. \u201cThat\u2019s likely just a matter of a rival smuggler. There are two gangs that I\u2019ve had a wee bit of difficulty with now and then.\u201d He waved a hand, scattering crumbs, and reached for another roll.</p><p>\u201cThe way the man behaved\u2014smellin\u2019 the brandy, but seldom tasting it\u2014he may be a d\u00e9gustateur de vin; someone that can tell from a sniff where a wine was made, and from a taste, which year it was bottled. A verra valuable fellow,\u201d he added thoughtfully, \u201cand a choice hound to set on my trail.\u201d</p><p>Wine had come along with the supper. I poured out a glass and passed it under my own nose.</p><p>\u201cHe could track you\u2014you, personally\u2014through the brandy?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cMore or less. You\u2019ll remember my cousin Jared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You mean he\u2019s still alive?\u201d After the slaughter of Culloden and the erosions of its aftermath, it was wonderfully heartening to hear that Jared, a wealthy Scottish \u00e9migr\u00e9 with a prosperous wine business in Paris, was still among the quick, and not the dead.</p><p>\u201cI expect they\u2019ll have to head him up in a cask and toss him into the Seine to get rid of him,\u201d Jamie said, teeth gleaming white in his soot-stained countenance. \u201cAye, he\u2019s not only alive, but enjoying it. Where d\u2019ye think I get the French brandy I bring into Scotland?\u201d</p><p>The obvious answer was \u201cFrance,\u201d but I refrained from saying so. \u201cJared, I suppose?\u201d I said instead.</p><p>Jamie nodded, mouth full of another roll. \u201cHey!\u201d He leaned forward and snatched the plate out from under the tentative reach of Young Ian\u2019s skinny fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re no supposed to be eating rich stuff like that when your wame\u2019s curdled,\u201d he said, frowning and chewing. He swallowed and licked his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll call for more bread and milk for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Uncle,\u201d said Young Ian, looking longingly at the savory rolls. \u201cI\u2019m awfully hungry.\u201d Purged by confession, the boy had recovered his spirits considerably, and evidently, his appetite as well.</p><p>Jamie looked at his nephew and sighed. \u201cAye well. Ye swear you\u2019re no going to vomit on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Uncle,\u201d Young Ian said meekly.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Jamie shoved the plate in the boy\u2019s direction, and returned to his explanation.</p><p>\u201cJared sends me mostly the second-quality bottling from his own vineyards in the Moselle, keepin\u2019 the first quality for sale in France, where they can tell the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the stuff you bring into Scotland is identifiable?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, reaching for the wine. \u201cOnly to a nez, a d\u00e9gustateur, that is. But the fact is, that wee Ian here saw the man taste the wine at the Dog and Gun and at the Blue Boar, and those are the two taverns on the High Street that buy brandy from me exclusively. Several others buy from me, but from others as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn any case, as I say, I\u2019m none so concerned at havin\u2019 someone look for Jamie Roy at a tavern.\u201d He lifted his wineglass and passed it under his own nose by reflex, made a slight, unconscious face, and drank. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, lowering the glass, \u201cwhat worries me is that the man should have found his way to the printshop. For I\u2019ve taken considerable pains to make sure that the folk who see Jamie Roy on the docks at Burntisland are not the same ones who pass the time o\u2019 day in the High Street with Mr. Alec Malcolm, the printer.\u201d</p><p>I knitted my brows, trying to work it out.</p><p>\u201cBut Sir Percival called you Malcolm, and he knows you\u2019re a smuggler,\u201d I protested.</p><p>Jamie nodded patiently. \u201cHalf the men in the ports near Edinburgh are smugglers, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, Sir Percival kens fine I\u2019m a smuggler, but he doesna ken I\u2019m Jamie Roy\u2014let alone James Fraser. He thinks I bring in bolts of undeclared silk and velvet from Holland\u2014because that\u2019s what I pay him in.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cI trade brandy for them, to the tailor on the corner. Sir Percival\u2019s an eye for fine cloth, and his lady even more. But he doesna ken I\u2019ve to do wi\u2019 the liquor\u2014let alone how much\u2014or he\u2019d be wanting a great deal more than the odd bit of lace and yardage, I\u2019ll tell ye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould one of the tavern owners have told the seaman about you? Surely they\u2019ve seen you.\u201d</p><p>He ruffled a hand through his hair, as he did when thinking, making a few short hairs on the crown stand up in a whorl of tiny spikes.</p><p>\u201cAye, they\u2019ve seen me,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cbut only as a customer. Fergus handles the business dealings wi\u2019 the taverns\u2014and Fergus is careful never to go near the printshop. He always meets me here, in private.\u201d He gave me a crooked grin. \u201cNo one questions a man\u2019s reasons for visiting a brothel, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould that be it?\u201d I asked, struck by a sudden thought. \u201cAny man can come here without question. Could the seaman Young Ian followed have seen you here\u2014you and Fergus? Or heard your description from one of the girls? After all, you\u2019re not the most inconspicuous man I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He wasn\u2019t, either. While there might be any number of redheaded men in Edinburgh, few of them towered to Jamie\u2019s height, and fewer still strode the streets with the unconscious arrogance of a disarmed warrior.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a verra useful thought, Sassenach,\u201d he said, giving me a nod. \u201cIt will be easy enough to find out whether a pigtailed seaman with one eye has been here recently; I\u2019ll have Jeanne ask among her lassies.\u201d</p> <p>He stood up, and stretched rackingly, his hands nearly touching the wooden rafters.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, Sassenach, perhaps we\u2019ll go to bed, aye?\u201d He lowered his arms and blinked at me with a smile. \u201cWhat wi\u2019 one thing and another, it\u2019s been the bloody hell of a day, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has, rather,\u201d I said, smiling back.</p><p>Jeanne, summoned for instructions, arrived together with Fergus, who opened the door for the madam with the easy familiarity of a brother or cousin. Little wonder if he felt at home, I supposed; he had been born in a Paris brothel, and spent the first ten years of his life there, sleeping in a cupboard beneath the stairs, when not making a living by picking pockets on the street.</p><p>\u201cThe brandy is gone,\u201d he reported to Jamie. \u201cI have sold it to MacAlpine\u2014at a small sacrifice in price, I regret, milord. I thought a quick sale the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to have it off the premises,\u201d Jamie said, nodding. \u201cWhat have ye done wi\u2019 the body?\u201d</p> <p>Fergus smiled briefly, his lean face and dark forelock lending him a distinctly piratical air.</p><p>\u201cOur intruder also has gone to MacAlpine\u2019s tavern, milord\u2014suitably disguised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs what?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>The pirate\u2019s grin turned on me; Fergus had turned out a very handsome man, the disfigurement of his hook notwithstanding.</p><p>\u201cAs a cask of cr\u00e8me de menthe, milady,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI do not suppose anyone has drunk cr\u00e8me de menthe in Edinburgh any time in the last hundred years,\u201d observed Madame Jeanne. \u201cThe heathen Scots are not accustomed to the use of civilized liqueurs; I have never seen a customer here take anything beyond whisky, beer, or brandywine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, Madame,\u201d Fergus said, nodding. \u201cWe do not want Mr. MacAlpine\u2019s tapmen broaching the cask, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely somebody\u2019s going to look in that cask sooner or later,\u201d I said. \u201cNot to be indelicate, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly, milady,\u201d Fergus said, with a respectful bow to me. \u201cThough cr\u00e8me de menthe has a very high content of alcohol. The tavern\u2019s cellar is but a temporary resting place on our unknown friend\u2019s journey to his eternal rest. He goes to the docks tomorrow, and thence to somewhere quite far away. It is only that I did not want him cluttering up Madame Jeanne\u2019s premises in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne addressed a remark in French to St. Agnes that I didn\u2019t quite catch, but then shrugged and turned to go.</p><p>\u201cI will make inquiries of les filles concerning this seaman tomorrow, Monsieur, when they are at leisure. For now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, speaking of leisure,\u201d Fergus interrupted, \u201cmight Mademoiselle Sophie find herself unemployed this evening?\u201d</p><p>The madam favored him with a look of ironic amusement. \u201cSince she saw you come in, mon petit saucisse, I expect that she has kept herself available.\u201d She glanced at Young Ian, slouched against the cushions like a scarecrow from which all the straw stuffing has been removed. \u201cAnd will I find a place for the young gentleman to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Jamie looked consideringly at his nephew. \u201cI suppose ye can lay a pallet in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Young Ian blurted. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to be alone wi\u2019 your wife, will ye not, Uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jamie stared at him uncomprehendingly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I mean...\u201d Young Ian hesitated, glancing at me, and then hastily away. \u201cI mean, nay doubt you\u2019ll be wanting to...er...mmphm?\u201d A Highlander born, he managed to infuse this last noise with an amazing wealth of implied indelicacy.</p><p>Jamie rubbed his knuckles hard across his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s verra thoughtful of ye, Ian,\u201d he said. His voice quivered slightly with the effort of not laughing. \u201cAnd I\u2019m flattered that ye have such a high opinion of my virility as to think I\u2019m capable of anything but sleeping in bed after a day like this. But I think perhaps I can forgo the satisfaction of my carnal desires for one night\u2014fond as I am of your auntie,\u201d he added, giving me a faint grin.</p><p>\u201cBut Bruno tells me the establishment is not busy tonight,\u201d Fergus put in, glancing round in some bewilderment. \u201cWhy does the boy not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s no but fourteen, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Jamie said, scandalized.</p><p>\u201cAlmost fifteen!\u201d Young Ian corrected, sitting up and looking interested.</p><p>\u201cWell, that is certainly sufficient,\u201d Fergus said, with a glance at Madame Jeanne for confirmation. \u201cYour brothers were no older when I first brought them here, and they acquitted themselves honorably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d Jamie goggled at his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cWell, someone had to,\u201d Fergus said, with slight impatience. \u201cNormally, a boy\u2019s father\u2014but of course, le Monsieur is not\u2014meaning no disrespect to your esteemed father, of course,\u201d he added, with a nod to Young Ian, who nodded back like a mechanical toy, \u201cbut it is a matter for experienced judgment, you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u201d\u2014he turned to Madame Jeanne, with the air of a gourmand consulting the wine steward\u2014\u201cDorcas, do you think, or Penelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said, shaking her head decidedly, \u201cit should be the second Mary, absolutely. The small one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, with the yellow hair? Yes, I think you are right,\u201d Fergus said approvingly. \u201cFetch her, then.\u201d</p><p>Jeanne was off before Jamie could manage more than a strangled croak in protest.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014the lad canna\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Young Ian said. \u201cAt least, I think I can.\u201d It wasn\u2019t possible for his face to grow any redder, but his ears were crimson with excitement, the traumatic events of the day completely forgotten.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s\u2014that is to say\u2014I canna be letting ye\u2014\u201d Jamie broke off and stood glaring at his nephew for a long moment. Finally, he threw his hands up in the air in exasperated defeat.</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I to say to your mother?\u201d he demanded, as the door opened behind him.</p><p>Framed in the door stood a very short young girl, plump and soft as a partridge in her blue silk chemise, her round sweet face beaming beneath a loose cloud of yellow hair. At the sight of her, Young Ian froze, scarcely breathing.</p><p>When at last he must draw breath or die, he drew it, and turned to Jamie. With a smile of surpassing sweetness, he said, \u201cWell, Uncle Jamie, if I were you\u201d\u2014his voice soared up in a sudden alarming soprano, and he stopped, clearing his throat before resuming in a respectable baritone\u2014\u201cI wouldna tell her. Good night to ye, Auntie,\u201d he said, and walked purposefully forward.</p><p>\u201cI canna decide whether I must kill Fergus or thank him.\u201d Jamie was sitting on the bed in our attic room, slowly unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>I laid the damp dress over the stool and knelt down in front of him to unbuckle the knee buckles of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he was trying to do his best for Young Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye\u2014in his bloody immoral French way.\u201d Jamie reached back to untie the lace that held his hair back. He had not plaited it again when we left Moubray\u2019s, and it fell soft and loose on his shoulders, framing the broad cheekbones and long straight nose, so that he looked like one of the fiercer Italian angels of the Renaissance.</p><p>\u201cWas it the Archangel Michael who drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden?\u201d I asked, stripping off his stockings.</p><p>He gave a slight chuckle. \u201cDo I strike ye so\u2014as the guardian o\u2019 virtue? And Fergus as the wicked serpent?\u201d His hands came under my elbows as he bent to lift me up. \u201cGet up, Sassenach; ye shouldna be on your knees, serving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had rather a time of it today yourself,\u201d I answered, making him stand up with me. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t have to kill anyone.\u201d There were large blisters on his hands, and while he had wiped away most of the soot, there was still a streak down the side of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d My hands went around his waist to help with the waistband of his breeches, but he held them there, resting his cheek for a moment against the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI wasna quite honest wi\u2019 the lad, ye ken,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo? I thought you did wonderfully with him. He felt better after he talked to you, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I hope so. And may be the prayers and such will help\u2014they canna hurt him, at least. But I didna tell him everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d I tilted up my face to his, touching his lips softly with my own. He smelled of smoke and sweat.</p><p>\u201cWhat a man most often does, when he\u2019s soul-sick wi\u2019 killing, is to find a woman, Sassenach,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cHis own, if he can; another, if he must. For she can do what he cannot\u2014and heal him.\u201d</p><p>My fingers found the lacing of his fly; it came loose with a tug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you let him go with the second Mary?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged, and stepping back a pace, pushed the breeches down and off. \u201cI couldna stop him.

And what about you?\u201d I pulled the chemise off over my head.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He stared down at me, eyebrows raised, the grimy linen shirt hanging loose upon his shoulders.</p><p>I glanced behind him at the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes. You haven\u2019t killed anyone, but do you want to...mmphm?\u201d I met his gaze, raising my own brows in question.</p> <p>The smile broadened across his face, and any resemblance to Michael, stern guardian of virtue, vanished. He lifted one shoulder, then the other, and let them fall, and the shirt slid down his arms to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI expect I do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be gentle wi\u2019 me, aye?\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>CULLODEN\u2019S LAST VICTIM</p><p>In the morning, I saw Jamie and Ian off on their pious errand, and then set off myself, stopping to purchase a large wicker basket from a vendor in the street. It was time I began to equip myself again, with whatever I could find in the way of medical supplies. After the events of the preceding day, I was beginning to fear I would have need of them before long.</p><p>Haugh\u2019s apothecary shop hadn\u2019t changed at all, through English occupation, Scottish Rising, and the Stuart\u2019s fall, and my heart rose in delight as I stepped through the door into the rich, familiar smells of hartshorn, peppermint, almond oil, and anise.</p> <p>The man behind the counter was Haugh, but a much younger Haugh than the middle-aged man I had dealt with twenty years before, when I had patronized this shop for tidbits of military intelligence, as well as for nostrums and herbs.</p><p>The younger Haugh did not know me, of course, but went courteously about the business of finding the herbs I wanted, among the neatly ranged jars on his shelves. A good many were common\u2014rosemary, tansy, marigold\u2014but a few on my list made the young Haugh\u2019s ginger eyebrows rise, and his lips purse in thoughtfulness as he looked over the jars.</p><p>There was another customer in the shop, hovering near the counter, where tonics were dispensed and compounds ground to order. He strode back and forth, hands clasped behind his back, obviously impatient. After a moment, he came up to the counter.</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he snapped at Mr. Haugh\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI canna just say, Reverend,\u201d the apothecary\u2019s voice was apologetic. \u201cLouisa did say as \u2019twould need to be boiled.\u201d</p><p>The only reply to this was a snort, and the man, tall and narrow-shouldered in black, resumed his pacing, glancing from time to time at the doorway to the back room, where the invisible Louisa was presumably at work. The man looked slightly familiar, but I had no time to think where I had seen him before.</p><p>Mr. Haugh was squinting dubiously at the list I had given him. \u201cAconite, now,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAconite. And what might that be, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s poison, for one thing,\u201d I said. Mr. Haugh\u2019s mouth dropped open momentarily.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a medicine, too,\u201d I assured him. \u201cBut you have to be careful in the use of it. Externally, it\u2019s good for rheumatism, but a very tiny amount taken by mouth will lower the rate of the pulse. Good for some kinds of heart trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Mr. Haugh said, blinking. He turned to his shelves, looking rather helpless. \u201cEr, do ye ken what it smells like, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Taking this for invitation, I came round the counter and began to sort through the jars. They were all carefully labeled, but the labels of some were clearly old, the ink faded, and the paper peeling at the edges.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m none so canny wi\u2019 the medicines as my Da yet,\u201d young Mr. Haugh was saying at my elbow. \u201cHe\u2019d taught me a good bit, but then he passed on a year ago, and there\u2019s things here as I dinna ken the use of, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that one\u2019s good for cough,\u201d I said, taking down a jar of elecampane with a glance at the impatient Reverend, who had taken out a handkerchief and was wheezing asthmatically into it. \u201cParticularly sticky-sounding coughs.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at the crowded shelves. Everything was dusted and immaculate, but evidently not filed according either to alphabetical or botanical order. Had old Mr. Haugh merely remembered where things were, or had he a system of some kind? I closed my eyes and tried to remember the last time I had been in the shop.</p><p>To my surprise, the image came back easily. I had come for foxglove then, to make the infusions for Alex Randall, younger brother of Black Jack Randall\u2014and Frank\u2019s six-times great-grandfather. Poor boy, he had been dead now twenty years, though he had lived long enough to sire a son. I felt a twinge of curiosity at the thought of that son, and of his mother, who had been my friend, but I forced my mind away from them, back to the image of Mr. Haugh, standing on tiptoe to reach up to his shelves, over near the right-hand side...</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Sure enough, my hand rested near the jar labeled FOXGLOVE. To one side of it was a jar labeled HORSETAIL, to the other, LILY OF THE VALLEY ROOT. I hesitated, looking at them, running over in my mind the possible uses of those herbs. Cardiac herbs, all of them. If aconite was to be found, it would be close by, then.</p><p>It was. I found it quickly, in a jar labeled AULD WIVES HUID.</p><p>\u201cBe careful with it.\u201d I handed the jar gingerly to Mr. Haugh. \u201cEven a bit of it will make your skin go numb. Perhaps I\u2019d better have a glass bottle for it.\u201d Most of the herbs I\u2019d bought had been wrapped up in squares of gauze or twisted in screws of paper, but the young Mr. Haugh nodded and carried the jar of aconite into the back room, held at arm\u2019s length, as though he expected it to explode in his face.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d seem to know a good deal more about the medicines than the lad,\u201d said a deep, hoarse voice behind me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve somewhat more experience than he has, likely.\u201d I turned to find the minister leaning on the counter, watching me under thick brows with pale blue eyes. I realized with a start where I had seen him; in Moubray\u2019s, the day before. He gave no sign of recognizing me; perhaps because my cloak covered Daphne\u2019s dress. I had noticed that many men took relatively little notice of the face of a woman en d\u00e9colletage, though it seemed a regrettable habit in a clergyman. He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. And d\u2019ye ken what to do for a nervous complaint, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of nervous complaint?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips and frowned, as though unsure whether to trust me. The upper lip came to a slight point, like an owl\u2019s beak, but the lower was thick and pendulous.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u2019tis a complicated case. But to speak generally, now\u201d\u2014he eyed me carefully\u2014\u201cwhat would ye give for a sort of...fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEpileptic seizure? Where the person falls down and twitches?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, showing a reddened band about his neck, where the high white stock had chafed it.</p><p>\u201cNo, a different kind of fit. Screaming and staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScreaming and staring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at once, ye ken,\u201d he added hastily. \u201cFirst the one, and then the other\u2014or rather, roundabout. First she\u2019ll do naught but stare for days on end, not speaking, and then of a sudden, she\u2019ll scream fit to wake the deid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds very trying.\u201d It did; if he had a wife so afflicted, it could easily explain the deep lines of strain that bracketed his mouth and eyes, and the blue circles of exhaustion beneath his eyes.</p><p>I tapped a finger on the counter, considering. \u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2019d have to see the patient.\u201d</p><p>The minister\u2019s tongue touched his lower lip. \u201cPerhaps...would ye be willing maybe, to come and see her? It isn\u2019t far,\u201d he added, rather stiffly. Pleading didn\u2019t come naturally to him, but the urgency of his request communicated itself despite the stiffness of his figure.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, just now,\u201d I told him. \u201cI have to meet my husband. But perhaps this afternoon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo o\u2019clock,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cHenderson\u2019s, in Carrubber\u2019s Close. Campbell is the name, the Reverend Archibald Campbell.\u201d</p><p>Before I could say yes or no, the curtain between the front room and the back twitched aside, and Mr. Haugh appeared with two bottles, one of which he handed to each of us.</p><p>The Reverend eyed his with suspicion, as he groped in his pocket for a coin.</p><p>\u201cWeel, and there\u2019s your price,\u201d he said ungraciously, slapping it on the counter. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll hope as you\u2019ve given me the right one, and no the lady\u2019s poison.\u201d</p><p>The curtain rustled again and a woman looked out after the departing form of the minister.</p><p>\u201cGood riddance,\u201d she remarked. \u201cHappence for an hour\u2019s work, and insult on the top of it! The Lord might ha\u2019 chosen better, is all I can say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d I asked, curious whether Louisa might have any helpful information about the afflicted wife.</p><p>\u201cNot to say I ken him weel, no,\u201d Louisa said, staring at me in frank curiosity. \u201cHe\u2019s one o\u2019 they Free Church meenisters, as is always rantin\u2019 on the corner by the Market Cross, tellin\u2019 folk as their behavior\u2019s of nay consequence at all, and all that\u2019s needful for salvation is that they shall \u2018come to grips wi\u2019 Jesus\u2019\u2014like as if Our Lord was to be a fair-day wrestler!\u201d She sniffed disdainfully at this heretical viewpoint, crossing herself against contamination.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised the likes of the Reverend Campbell should come in our shop, hearin\u2019 what he thinks o\u2019 Papists by and large.\u201d Her eyes sharpened at me.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll maybe be Free Church yoursel\u2019, ma\u2019am; meanin\u2019 no offense to ye, if so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m a Catholic\u2014er, a Papist, too,\u201d I assured her. \u201cI was only wondering whether you knew anything about the Reverend\u2019s wife, and her condition.\u201d</p><p>Louisa shook her head, turning to deal with a new customer.</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019ve ne\u2019er seen the lady. But whatever\u2019s the matter with her,\u201d she added, frowning after the departed Reverend, \u201cI\u2019m sure that livin\u2019 wi\u2019 him doesna improve it any!\u201d</p><p>The weather was chill but clear, and only a faint hint of smoke lingered in the Rectory garden as a reminder of the fire. Jamie and I sat on a bench against the wall, absorbing the pale winter sunshine as we waited for Young Ian to finish his confession.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Ian that load of rubbish he gave Young Ian yesterday? About where I\u2019d been all this time?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said. \u201cIan\u2019s a good deal too canny to believe it, but it\u2019s a likely enough story, and he\u2019s too good a friend to insist on the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it will do, for general consumption,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut shouldn\u2019t you have told it to Sir Percival, instead of letting him think we were newlyweds?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head decidedly. \u201cOch, no. For the one thing, Sir Percival has no notion of my real name, though I\u2019ll lay a year\u2019s takings he knows it isna Malcolm. I dinna want him to be thinking of me and Culloden together, by any means. And for another, a story like the one I gave Ian would cause the devil of a lot more talk than the news that the printer\u2019s taken a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Oh, what a tangled web we weave,\u2019\u201d I intoned, \u201c\u2018when first we practice to deceive.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a quick blue glance, and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt gets a bit easier with practice, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cTry living wi\u2019 me for a time, and ye\u2019ll find yourself spinning silk out of your arse easy as sh\u2014, er, easy as kiss-my-hand.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you do that,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou already have.\u201d He stood up and craned his neck, trying to see over the wall into the Rectory garden.</p> <p>\u201cYoung Ian\u2019s being the devil of a time,\u201d he remarked, sitting down again. \u201cHow can a lad not yet fifteen have that much to confess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the day and night he had yesterday? I suppose it depends how much detail Father Hayes wants to hear,\u201d I said, with a vivid recollection of my breakfast with the prostitutes. \u201cHas he been in there all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, no.\u201d The tips of Jamie\u2019s ears grew slightly pinker in the morning light. \u201cI, er, I had to go first. As an example, ye ken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder it took some time,\u201d I said, teasing. \u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve been to confession?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Father Hayes it was six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but I supposed if he was going to shrive me for thieving, assault, and profane language, he might as well shrive me for lying, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, no fornication or impure thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d he said austerely. \u201cYe can think any manner of horrible things without sin, and it\u2019s to do wi\u2019 your wife. It\u2019s only if you\u2019re thinking it about other ladies, it\u2019s impure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea I was coming back to save your soul,\u201d I said primly, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice to be useful.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, bent and kissed me thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if that counts as an indulgence,\u201d he said, pausing for breath. \u201cIt ought to, no? It does a great deal more to keep a man from the fires of hell than saying the rosary does. Speaking of which,\u201d he added, digging into his pocket and coming out with a rather chewed-looking wooden rosary, \u201cremind me that I must say my penance sometime today. I was about to start on it, when ye came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many Hail Marys are you supposed to say?\u201d I asked, fingering the beads. The chewed appearance wasn\u2019t illusion; there were definite small toothmarks on most of the beads.</p><p>\u201cI met a Jew last year,\u201d he said, ignoring the question. \u201cA natural philosopher, who\u2019d sailed round the world six times. He told me that in both the Musselman faith and the Jewish teachings, it was considered an act of virtue for a man and his wife to lie wi\u2019 each other.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if that has anything to do wi\u2019 both Jews and Musselmen being circumcised?\u201d he added thoughtfully. \u201cI never thought to ask him that\u2014though perhaps he would ha\u2019 found it indelicate to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think a foreskin more or less would impair the virtue,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d he said, and kissed me once more.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your rosary?\u201d I asked, picking up the string where it had fallen on the grass. \u201cIt looks like the rats have been at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot rats,\u201d he said. \u201cBairns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bairns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, any that might be about.\u201d He shrugged, tucking the beads back in his pocket. \u201cYoung Jamie has three now, and Maggie and Kitty two each. Wee Michael\u2019s just married, but his wife\u2019s breeding.\u201d The sun was behind him, darkening his face, so that his teeth flashed suddenly white when he smiled. \u201cYe didna ken ye were a great-aunt seven times over, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great-aunt?\u201d I said, staggered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a great-uncle,\u201d he said cheerfully, \u201cand I havena found it a terrible trial, except for having my beads gnawed when the weans are cutting teeth\u2014that, and bein\u2019 expected to answer to \u2018Nunkie\u2019 a lot.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes twenty years seemed like an instant, and sometimes it seemed like a very long time indeed.</p><p>\u201cEr...there isn\u2019t a feminine equivalent of \u2018Nunkie,\u2019 I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d he assured me. \u201cThey\u2019ll all call ye Great-Auntie Claire, and treat ye wi\u2019 the utmost respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I muttered, with visions of the hospital\u2019s geriatric wing fresh in my mind.</p><p>Jamie laughed, and with a lightness of heart no doubt engendered by being newly freed from sin, grasped me around the waist and lifted me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never before seen a great-auntie wi\u2019 a lovely plump arse like that,\u201d he said with approval, bouncing me slightly on his knees. His breath tickled the back of my neck as he leaned forward. I let out a small shriek as his teeth closed lightly on my ear.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Auntie?\u201d said Young Ian\u2019s voice just behind us, full of concern.</p><p>Jamie started convulsively, nearly unshipping me from his lap, then tightened his hold on my waist.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just your auntie saw a spider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d said Young Ian, peering interestedly over the bench.</p><p>\u201cUp there.\u201d Jamie rose, standing me on my feet, and pointed to the lime tree, where\u2014sure enough\u2014the web of an orb weaver stretched across the crook of two branches, sparkling with damp. The weaver herself sat in the center, round as a cherry, wearing a gaudy pattern of green and yellow on her back.</p><p>\u201cI was telling your auntie,\u201d Jamie said, as Young Ian examined the web in lashless fascination, \u201cabout a Jew I met, a natural philosopher. He\u2019d made a study of spiders, it seems; in fact, he was in Edinburgh to deliver a learned paper to the Royal Society, in spite of being a Jew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Did he tell ye a lot about spiders?\u201d Young Ian asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cA lot more than I cared to know,\u201d Jamie informed his nephew. \u201cThere are times and places for talkin\u2019 of spiders that lay eggs in caterpillars so the young hatch out and devour the poor beast while it\u2019s still alive, but during supper isna one of them. He did say one thing I thought verra interesting, though,\u201d he added, squinting at the web. He blew gently on it, and the spider scuttled briskly into hiding.</p><p>\u201cHe said that spiders spin two kinds of silk, and if ye have a lens\u2014and can make the spider sit still for it, I suppose\u2014ye can see the two places where the silk comes out; spinnerets, he called them. In any case, the one kind of silk is sticky, and if a wee bug touches it, he\u2019s done for. But the other kind is dry silk, like the sort ye\u2019d embroider with, but finer.\u201d</p><p>The orb weaver was advancing cautiously toward the center of her web again.</p><p>\u201cSee where she walks?\u201d Jamie pointed to the web, anchored by a number of spokes, supporting the intricate netlike whorl. \u201cThe spokes there, those are spun of the dry silk, so the spider can walk over it herself wi\u2019 no trouble. But the rest o\u2019 the web is the sticky kind of silk\u2014or mostly so\u2014and if ye watch a spider careful for quite a long time, you\u2019ll see that she goes only on the dry strands, for if she walked on the sticky stuff, she\u2019d be stuck herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ian breathed reverently on the web, watching intently as the spider moved away along her nonskid road to safety.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there\u2019s a moral there for web weavers,\u201d Jamie observed to me, sotto voce. \u201cBe sure ye know which of your strands are sticky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it helps even more if you have the kind of luck that will conjure up a handy spider when you need one,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>He laughed and took my arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not luck, Sassenach,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s watchfulness. Ian, are ye coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Young Ian abandoned the web with obvious reluctance and followed us to the kirkyard gate.</p><p>\u201cOh, Uncle Jamie, I meant to ask, can I borrow your rosary?\u201d he said, as we emerged onto the cobbles of the Royal Mile. \u201cThe priest told me I must say five decades for my penance, and that\u2019s too many to keep count of on my fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely.\u201d Jamie stopped and fished in his pocket for the rosary. \u201cBe sure to give it back, though.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian grinned. \u201cAye, I reckon you\u2019ll be needing it yourself, Uncle Jamie. The priest told me he was verra wicked,\u201d Young Ian confided to me, with a lashless wink, \u201cand told me not to be like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jamie glanced up and down the road, gauging the speed of an approaching handcart, edging its way down the steep incline. Freshly shaved that morning, his cheeks had a rosy glow about them.</p><p>\u201cHow many decades of the rosary are you supposed to say as penance?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cEighty-five,\u201d he muttered. The rosiness of his freshly shaved cheeks deepened.</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s mouth dropped open in awe.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since ye went to confession, Uncle?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA long time,\u201d Jamie said tersely. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>Jamie had an appointment after dinner to meet with a Mr. Harding, representative of the Hand in Hand Assurance Society, which had insured the premises of the printshop, to inspect the ashy remains with him and verify the loss.</p><p>\u201cI willna need ye, laddie,\u201d he said reassuringly to Young Ian, who looked less than enthusiastic about the notion of revisiting the scene of his adventures. \u201cYou go wi\u2019 your auntie to see this madwoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI canna tell how ye do it,\u201d he added to me, raising one brow. \u201cYou\u2019re in the city less than two days, and all the afflicted folk for miles about are clutching at your hems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly all of them,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s only one woman, after all, and I haven\u2019t even seen her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. At least madness isna catching\u2014I hope.\u201d He kissed me briefly, then turned to go, clapping Young Ian companionably on the shoulder. \u201cLook after your auntie, Ian.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian paused for a moment, looking after the tall form of his departing uncle.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go with him, Ian?\u201d I asked. \u201cI can manage alone, if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Auntie!\u201d He turned back to me, looking rather abashed. \u201cI dinna want to go, at all. It\u2019s only\u2014I was wondering\u2014well, what if they...find anything? In the ashes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA body, you mean,\u201d I said bluntly. I had realized, of course, that the distinct possibility that Jamie and Mr. Harding would find the body of the one-eyed seaman was the reason Jamie had told Ian to accompany me.</p><p>The boy nodded, looking ill at ease. His skin had faded to a sort of rosy tan, but was still too dark to show any paleness due to emotion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIf the fire was a very hot one, there may be nothing much left to find. But don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I touched his arm in reassurance. \u201cYour uncle will know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so.\u201d His face brightened, full of faith in his uncle\u2019s ability to handle any situation whatever. I smiled when I saw his expression, then realized with a small start of surprise that I had that faith, too. Be it drunken Chinese, corrupt Customs agents, or Mr. Harding of the Hand in Hand Assurance Society, I hadn\u2019t any doubt that Jamie would manage.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d I said, as the bell in the Canongate Kirk began to ring. \u201cIt\u2019s just on two now.\u201d</p><p>Despite his visit to Father Hayes, Ian had retained a certain air of dreamy bliss, which returned to him now, and there was little conversation as we made our way up the slope of the Royal Mile to Henderson\u2019s lodging house, in Carrubber\u2019s Close.</p><p>It was a quiet hotel, but luxurious by Edinburgh standards, with a patterned carpet on the stairs and colored glass in the street window. It seemed rather rich surroundings for a Free Church minister, but then I knew little about Free Churchmen; perhaps they took no vow of poverty as the Catholic clergy did.</p><p>Showed up to the third floor by a young boy, we found the door opened to us at once by a heavyset woman wearing an apron and a worried expression. I thought she might be in her mid-twenties, though she had already lost several of her front teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the lady as the Reverend said would call?\u201d she asked. Her expression lightened a bit at my nod, and she swung the door wider.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Campbell\u2019s had to go oot the noo,\u201d she said in a broad Lowland accent, \u201cbut he said as how he\u2019d be most obliged to hae yer advice regardin\u2019 his sister, mum.\u201d</p><p>Sister, not wife. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I said. \u201cMay I see Miss Campbell?\u201d</p><p>Leaving Ian to his memories in the sitting room, I accompanied the woman, who introduced herself as Nellie Cowden, to the back bedroom.</p><p>Miss Campbell was, as advertised, staring. Her pale blue eyes were wide open, but didn\u2019t seem to be looking at anything\u2014certainly not at me.</p><p>She sat in the sort of wide, low chair called a nursing chair, with her back to the fire. The room was dim, and the backlighting made her features indistinct, except for the unblinking eyes. Seen closer to, her features were still indistinct; she had a soft, round face, undistinguished by any apparent bone structure, and baby-fine brown hair, neatly brushed. Her nose was small and snub, her chin double, and her mouth hung pinkly open, so slack as to obscure its natural lines.</p><p>\u201cMiss Campbell?\u201d I said cautiously. There was no response from the plump figure in the chair. Her eyes did blink, I saw, though much less frequently than normal.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019ll nae answer ye, whilst she\u2019s in this state,\u201d Nellie Cowden said behind me. She shook her head, wiping her hands upon her apron. \u201cNay, not a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been like this?\u201d I picked up a limp, pudgy hand and felt for the pulse. It was there, slow and quite strong.</p><p>\u201cOh, for twa days so far, this time.\u201d Becoming interested, Miss Cowden leaned forward, peering into her charge\u2019s face. \u201cUsually she stays like that for a week or more\u2014thirteen days is the longest she\u2019s done it.\u201d</p><p>Moving slowly\u2014though Miss Campbell seemed unlikely to be alarmed\u2014I began to examine the unresisting figure, meanwhile asking questions of her attendant. Miss Margaret Campbell was thirty-seven, Miss Cowden told me, the only relative of the Reverend Archibald Campbell, with whom she had lived for the past twenty years, since the death of their parents.</p><p>\u201cWhat starts her doing this? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>Miss Cowden shook her head. \u201cNo tellin\u2019, Mum. Nothin\u2019 seems to start it. One minute she\u2019ll be lookin\u2019 aboot, talkin\u2019 and laughin\u2019, eatin\u2019 her dinner like the sweet child she is, and the next\u2014wheesht!\u201d She snapped her fingers, then, for effect, leaned forward and snapped them again, deliberately, just under Miss Campbell\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cI could hae six men wi\u2019 trumpets pass through the room, and she\u2019d pay it nay more mind.\u201d</p><p>I was reasonably sure that Miss Campbell\u2019s trouble was mental, not physical, but I made a complete examination, anyway\u2014or as complete as could be managed without undressing that clumsy, inert form.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s when she comes oot of it that\u2019s the worst, though,\u201d Miss Cowden assured me, squatting next to me as I knelt on the floor to check Miss Campbell\u2019s plantar reflexes. Her feet, loosed from shoes and stockings, were damp and smelled musty.</p><p>I drew a fingernail firmly down the sole of each foot in turn, checking for a Babinski reflex that might indicate the presence of a brain lesion. Nothing, though; her toes curled under, in normal startlement.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens then? Is that the screaming the Reverend mentioned?\u201d I rose to my feet. \u201cWill you bring me a lighted candle, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, the screamin\u2019.\u201d Miss Cowden hastened to oblige, lighting a wax taper from the fire. \u201cShe do shriek somethin\u2019 awful then, on and on \u2019til she\u2019s worn herself oot. Then she\u2019ll fall asleep\u2014sleep the clock around, she will\u2014and wake as though nothin\u2019 had happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s quite all right when she wakes?\u201d I asked. I moved the candle flame slowly back and forth, a few inches before the patient\u2019s eyes. The pupils shrank in automatic response to the light, but the irises stayed fixed, not following the flame. My hand itched for the solid handle of an ophthalmoscope, to examine the retinas, but no such luck.</p><p>\u201cWell, not to say all right,\u201d Miss Cowden said slowly. I turned from the patient to look at her and she shrugged, massive shoulders powerful under the linen of her blouse.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s saft in the heid, puir dear,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly. \u201cHas been for nigh on twenty year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking care of her all that time, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Mr. Campbell had a woman as cared for her where they lived, in Burntisland, but the woman was none so young, and didna wish to leave her home. So when the Reverend made up his mind to take up the Missionary Society\u2019s offer, and to take his sister wi\u2019 him to the West Indies\u2014why, he advertised for a strong woman o\u2019 good character who wouldna mind travel to be an abigail for her...and here I am.\u201d Miss Cowden gave me a gap-toothed smile in testimony to her own virtues.</p><p>\u201cThe West Indies? He\u2019s planning to take Miss Campbell on a ship to the West Indies?\u201d I was staggered; I knew just enough of sailing conditions to think that any such trip would be a major ordeal to a woman in good health. This woman\u2014but then I reconsidered. All things concerned, Margaret Campbell might endure such a trip better than a normal woman\u2014at least if she remained in her trance.</p><p>\u201cHe thought as the change of climate might be good for her,\u201d Miss Cowden was explaining. \u201cGet her away from Scotland, and all the dreadful memories. Ought to ha\u2019 done it long since, is what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of dreadful memories?\u201d I asked. I could see by the gleam in Miss Cowden\u2019s eye that she was only too ready to tell me. I had finished the examination by this time, and concluded that there was little physically wrong with Miss Campbell save inactivity and poor diet, but there was the chance that something in her history might suggest some treatment.</p><p>\u201cWeel,\u201d she began, sidling toward the table, where a decanter and several glasses stood on a tray, \u201cit\u2019s only what Tilly Lawson told me, her as looked after Miss Campbell for sae long, but she did swear it was the truth, and her a godly woman. If ye\u2019d care to take a drop of cordial, mum, for the sake o\u2019 the Reverend\u2019s hospitality?\u201d</p><p>The chair Miss Campbell sat on was the only one in the room, so Miss Cowden and I perched inelegantly on the bed, side by side, and watched the silent figure before us, as we sipped our blackberry cordial, and she told me Margaret Campbell\u2019s story.</p><p>Margaret Campbell had been born in Burntisland, no more than five miles from Edinburgh, across the Firth of Forth. At the time of the \u201945, when Charles Stuart had marched into Edinburgh to reclaim his father\u2019s throne, she had been seventeen.</p><p>\u201cHer father was a Royalist, o\u2019 course, and her brother in a government regiment, marching north to put down the wicked rebels,\u201d said Miss Cowden, taking a tiny sip of the cordial to make it last. \u201cBut not Miss Margaret. Nay, she was for the Bonnie Prince, and the Hielan\u2019 men that followed him.\u201d</p><p>One, in particular, though Miss Cowden did not know his name. But a fine man he must have been, for Miss Margaret stole away from her home to meet him, and told him all the bits of information that she gleaned from listening to her father and his friends, and from her brother\u2019s letters home.</p><p>But then had come Falkirk; a victory, but a costly one, followed by retreat. Rumor had attended the flight of the Prince\u2019s army to the north, and not a soul doubted but that their flight led to destruction. Miss Margaret, desperate at the rumors, left her home at dead of night in the cold March spring, and went to find the man she loved.</p><p>Now here the account had been uncertain\u2014whether it was that she had found the man and he had spurned her, or that she had not found him in time, and been forced to turn back from Culloden Moor\u2014but in any case, turn back she did, and the day after the battle, she had fallen into the hands of a band of English soldiers.</p><p>\u201cDreadful, what they did to her,\u201d Miss Cowden said, lowering her voice as though the figure in the chair could hear. \u201cDreadful!\u201d The English soldiers, blind with the lust of the hunt and the kill, pursuing the fugitives of Culloden, had not stopped to ask her name or the sympathies of her family. They had known by her speech that she was a Scot, and that knowledge had been enough.</p><p>They had left her for dead in a ditch half full of freezing water, and only the fortuitous presence of a family of tinkers, hiding in the nearby brambles for fear of the soldiers, had saved her.</p><p>\u201cI canna help but think it a pity they did save her, un-Christian thing it is to say,\u201d Miss Cowden whispered. \u201cIf not, the puir lamb might ha\u2019 slippit her earthly bonds and gone happy to God. But as it is\u2014\u201d She gestured clumsily at the silent figure, and drank down the last drops of her cordial.</p><p>Margaret had lived, but did not speak. Somewhat recovered, but silent, she traveled with the tinkers, moving south with them to avoid the pillaging of the Highlands that took place in the wake of Culloden. And then one day, sitting in the yard of a pothouse, holding the tin to collect coppers as the tinkers busked and sang, she had been found by her brother, who had stopped with his Campbell regiment to refresh themselves on the way back to their quarters at Edinburgh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe kent him, and him her, and the shock o\u2019 their meeting gave her back her voice, but not her mind, puir thing. He took her home, o\u2019 course, but she was always as though she was in the past\u2014sometime before she met the Hielan\u2019 man. Her father was dead then, from the influenza, and Tilly Lawson said as the shock o\u2019 seeing her like that kilt her mother, but could be as that were the influenza, too, for there was a great deal of it about that year.\u201d</p><p>The whole affair had left Archibald Campbell deeply embittered against both Highland Scots and the English army, and he had resigned his commission. With his parents dead, he found himself middling well-to-do, but the sole support of his damaged sister.</p><p>\u201cHe couldna marry,\u201d Miss Cowden explained, \u201cfor what woman would have him, and she\u201d\u2014with a nod toward the fire\u2014\u201cwas thrown into the bargain?\u201d</p><p>In his difficulties, he had turned to God, and become a minister. Unable to leave his sister, or to bear the confinement of the family house at Burntisland with her, he had purchased a coach, hired a woman to look after Margaret, and begun to make brief journeys into the surrounding countryside to preach, often taking her with him.</p> <p>In his preaching he had found success, and this year had been asked by the Society of Presbyterian Missionaries if he would undertake his longest journey yet, to the West Indies, there to organize churches and appoint elders on the colonies of Barbados and Jamaica. Prayer had given him his answer, and he had sold the family property in Burntisland and moved his sister to Edinburgh while he made preparations for the journey.</p><p>I glanced once more at the figure by the fire. The heated air from the hearth stirred the skirts about her feet, but beyond that small movement, she might have been a statue.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said with a sigh, \u201cthere\u2019s not a great deal I can do for her, I\u2019m afraid. But I\u2019ll give you some prescriptions\u2014receipts, I mean\u2014to have made up at the apothecary\u2019s before you go.\u201d</p><p>If they didn\u2019t help, they couldn\u2019t hurt, I reflected, as I copied down the short lists of ingredients. Chamomile, hops, rue, tansy, and verbena, with a strong pinch of peppermint, for a soothing tonic. Tea of rose hips, to help correct the slight nutritional deficiency I had noted\u2014spongy, bleeding gums, and a pale, bloated look about the face.</p><p>\u201cOnce you reach the Indies,\u201d I said, handing Miss Cowden the paper, \u201cyou must see that she eats a great deal of fruit\u2014oranges, grapefruit, and lemons, particularly. You should do the same,\u201d I added, causing a look of profound suspicion to flit across the maid\u2019s wide face. I doubted she ate any vegetable matter beyond the occasional onion or potato, save her daily parritch.</p> <p>The Reverend Campbell had not returned, and I saw no real reason to wait for him. Bidding Miss Campbell adieu, I pulled open the door of the bedroom, to find Young Ian standing on the other side of it.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d he said, startled. \u201cI was just comin\u2019 to find ye, Auntie. It\u2019s nearly half-past three, and Uncle Jamie said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d The voice came from behind me, from the chair beside the fire.</p><p>Miss Cowden and I whirled to find Miss Campbell sitting bolt upright, eyes still wide but focused now. They were focused on the doorway, and as Young Ian stepped inside, Miss Campbell began to scream.</p><p>Rather unsettled by the encounter with Miss Campbell, Young Ian and I made our way thankfully back to the refuge of the brothel, where we were greeted matter-of-factly by Bruno and taken to the rear parlor. There we found Jamie and Fergus deep in conversation.</p><p>\u201cTrue, we do not trust Sir Percival,\u201d Fergus was saying, \u201cbut in this case, what point is there to his telling you of an ambush, save that such an ambush is in fact to occur?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamned if I ken why,\u201d Jamie said frankly, leaning back and stretching in his chair. \u201cAnd that being so, we do, as ye say, conclude that there\u2019s meant to be an ambush by the excisemen. Two days, he said. That would be Mullen\u2019s Cove.\u201d Then, catching sight of me and Ian, he half-rose, motioning us to take seats.</p><p>\u201cWill it be the rocks below Balcarres, then?\u201d Fergus asked.</p><p>Jamie frowned in thought, the two stiff fingers of his right hand drumming slowly on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said at last. \u201cLet it be Arbroath; the wee cove under the abbey there. Just to be sure, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Fergus pushed back the half-empty plate of oatcakes from which he had been refreshing himself, and rose. \u201cI shall spread the word, milord. Arbroath, in four days.\u201d With a nod to me, he swirled his cloak about his shoulders and went out.</p><p>\u201cIs it the smuggling, Uncle?\u201d Young Ian asked eagerly. \u201cIs there a French lugger coming?\u201d He picked up an oatcake and bit into it, scattering crumbs over the table.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes were still abstracted, thinking, but they cleared as he glanced sharply at his nephew. \u201cAye, it is. And you, Young Ian, are having nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I could help!\u201d the boy protested. \u201cYou\u2019ll need someone to hold the mules, at least!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all your Da said to you and me yesterday, wee Ian?\u201d Jamie raised his brows. \u201cChrist, ye\u2019ve a short memory, lad!\u201d</p><p>Ian looked mildly abashed at this, and took another oatcake to cover his confusion. Seeing him momentarily silent, I took the opportunity to ask my own questions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to Arbroath to meet a French ship that\u2019s bringing in smuggled liquor?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019s dangerous, after Sir Percival\u2019s warning?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at me with one brow still raised, but answered patiently enough.</p><p>\u201cNo; Sir Percival was warning me that the rendezvous in two days\u2019 time is known. That was to take place at Mullen\u2019s Cove. I\u2019ve an arrangement wi\u2019 Jared and his captains, though. If a rendezvous canna be kept for some reason, the lugger will stand offshore and come in again the next night\u2014but to a different place. And there\u2019s a third fallback as well, should the second meeting not come off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Sir Percival knows the first rendezvous, won\u2019t he know the others, too?\u201d I persisted.</p><p>Jamie shook his head and poured out a cup of wine. He quirked a brow at me to ask whether I wanted any, and upon my shaking my head, sipped it himself.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rendezvous points are arranged in sets of three, between me and Jared, sent by sealed letter inside a packet addressed to Jeanne, here. Once I\u2019ve read the letter, I burn it. The men who\u2019ll help meet the lugger will all know the first point, of course\u2014I suppose one o\u2019 them will have let something slip,\u201d he added, frowning into his cup. \u201cBut no one\u2014not even Fergus\u2014kens the other two points unless we need to make use of one. And when we do, all the men ken well enough to guard their tongues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then it\u2019s bound to be safe, Uncle!\u201d Young Ian burst out. \u201cPlease let me come! I\u2019ll keep well back out o\u2019 the way,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Jamie gave his nephew a slightly jaundiced look.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye will,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll come wi\u2019 me to Arbroath, but you and your auntie will stay at the inn on the road above the abbey until we\u2019ve finished. I\u2019ve got to take the laddie home to Lallybroch, Claire,\u201d he explained, turning to me. \u201cAnd mend things as best I can with his parents.\u201d The elder Ian had left Halliday\u2019s that morning before Jamie and Young Ian arrived, leaving no message, but presumably bound for home. \u201cYe willna mind the journey? I wouldna ask it, and you just over your travel from Inverness\u201d\u2014his eyes met mine with a small, conspiratorial smile\u2014\u201cbut I must take him back as soon as may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all,\u201d I assured him. \u201cIt will be good to see Jenny and the rest of your family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Uncle\u2014\u201d Young Ian blurted. \u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still!\u201d Jamie snapped. \u201cThat will be all from you, laddie. Not another word, aye?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian looked wounded, but took another oatcake and inserted it into his mouth in a marked manner, signifying his intention to remain completely silent.</p><p>Jamie relaxed then, and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, and how was your visit to the madwoman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cJamie, do you know any people named Campbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot above three or four hundred of them,\u201d he said, a smile twitching his long mouth. \u201cHad ye a particular Campbell in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of them.\u201d I told him the story of Archibald Campbell and his sister, Margaret, as related to me by Nellie Cowden.</p><p>He shook his head at the tale, and sighed. For the first time, he looked truly older, his face tightened and lined by memory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no the worst tale I\u2019ve heard, of the things that happened after Culloden,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I dinna think\u2014wait.\u201d He stopped, and looked at me, eyes narrowed in thought. \u201cMargaret Campbell. Margaret. Would she be a bonny wee lass\u2014perhaps the size o\u2019 the second Mary? And wi\u2019 soft brown hair like a wren\u2019s feather, and a verra sweet face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably was, twenty years ago,\u201d I said, thinking of that still, plump figure sitting by the fire. \u201cWhy, do you know her after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I think I do.\u201d His brow was furrowed in thought, and he looked down at the table, drawing a random line through the spilled crumbs. \u201cAye, if I\u2019m right, she was Ewan Cameron\u2019s sweetheart. You\u2019ll mind Ewan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Ewan had been a tall, handsome joker of a man, who had worked with Jamie at Holyrood, gathering bits of intelligence that filtered through from England. \u201cWhat\u2019s become of Ewan? Or should I not ask?\u201d I said, seeing the shadow come over Jamie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThe English shot him,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTwo days after Culloden.\u201d He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them and smiled tiredly at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, may God bless the Reverend Archie Campbell. I\u2019d heard of him, a time or two, during the Rising. He was a bold soldier, folk said, and a brave one\u2014and I suppose he\u2019ll need to be now, poor man.\u201d He sat a moment longer, then stood up with decision.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, there\u2019s a great deal to be done before we leave Edinburgh. Ian, you\u2019ll find the list of the printshop customers upstairs on the table; fetch it down to me and I\u2019ll mark off for ye the ones with orders outstanding. Ye must go to see each one and offer back their money. Unless they choose to wait until I\u2019ve found new premises and laid in new stock\u2014that might take as much as two months, though, tell them.\u201d</p><p>He patted his coat, where something made a small jingling sound.</p><p>\u201cLuckily the assurance money will pay back the customers, and have a bit left over. Speaking of which\u201d\u2014he turned and smiled at me\u2014\u201cyour job, Sassenach, is to find a dressmaker who will manage ye a decent gown in two days\u2019 time. For I expect Daphne would like her dress back, and I canna take ye home to Lallybroch naked.\u201d</p><p>30</p><p>RENDEZVOUS </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The chief entertainment of the ride north to Arbroath was watching the conflict of wills between Jamie and Young Ian. I knew from long experience that stubbornness was one of the major components of a Fraser\u2019s character. Ian seemed not unduly handicapped in that respect, though only half a Fraser; either the Murrays were no slouches with regard to stubbornness, or the Fraser genes were strong ones.</p><p>Having had the opportunity to observe Brianna at close range for many years, I had my own opinion about that, but kept quiet, merely enjoying the spectacle of Jamie having for once met his match. By the time we passed Balfour, he was wearing a distinctly hunted look.</p><p>This contest between immovable object and irresistible force continued until early evening of the fourth day, when we reached Arbroath to find that the inn where Jamie had intended to leave Ian and myself no longer existed. No more than a tumbled-down stone wall and one or two charred roof-beams remained to mark the spot; otherwise, the road was deserted for miles in either direction.</p><p>Jamie looked at the heap of stones in silence for some time. It was reasonably obvious that he could not just leave us in the middle of a desolate, muddy road. Ian, wise enough not to press the advantage, kept also silent, though his skinny frame fairly vibrated with eagerness.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Jamie said at last, resigned. \u201cYe\u2019ll come. But only so far as the cliff\u2019s edge, Ian\u2014d\u2019ye hear? You\u2019ll take care of your auntie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear, Uncle Jamie,\u201d Young Ian replied, with deceptive meekness. I caught Jamie\u2019s wry glance, though, and understood that if Ian was to take care of auntie, auntie was also to take care of Ian. I hid a smile, nodding obediently.</p><p>The rest of the men were timely, arriving at the rendezvous point on the cliffside just after dark. A couple of the men seemed vaguely familiar, but most were just muffled shapes; it was two days past the dark of the moon, but the tiny sliver rising over the horizon made conditions here little more illuminating than those obtaining in the brothel\u2019s cellars. No introductions were made, the men greeting Jamie with unintelligible mutters and grunts.</p><p>There was one unmistakable figure, though. A large mule-drawn wagon appeared, rattling its way down the road, driven by Fergus and a diminutive object that could only be Mr. Willoughby, whom I had not seen since he had shot the mysterious man on the stairs of the brothel.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t a pistol with him tonight, I hope,\u201d I murmured to Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d he said, squinting into the gathering gloom. \u201cOh, the Chinee? No, none of them have.\u201d Before I could ask why not, he had gone forward, to help back the wagon around, ready to make a getaway toward Edinburgh, so soon as the contraband should be loaded. Young Ian pressed his way forward, and I, mindful of my job as custodian, followed him.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby stood on tiptoe to reach into the back of the wagon, emerging with an odd-looking lantern, fitted with a pierced metal top and sliding metal sides.</p><p>\u201cIs that a dark lantern?\u201d I asked, fascinated.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is,\u201d said Young Ian, importantly. \u201cYe keep the slides shut until we see the signal out at sea.\u201d He reached for the lantern. \u201cHere, give it me; I\u2019ll take it\u2014I ken the signal.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby merely shook his head, pulling the lantern out of Young Ian\u2019s grasp. \u201cToo tall, too young,\u201d he said. \u201cTsei-mi say so,\u201d he added, as though that settled the matter once and for all.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Young Ian was indignant. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean too tall and too young, ye wee\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe means,\u201d said a level voice behind us, \u201cthat whoever\u2019s holding the lantern is a bonny target, should we have visitors. Mr. Willoughby kindly takes the risk of it, because he\u2019s the smallest man among us. You\u2019re tall enough to see against the sky, wee Ian, and young enough to have nay sense yet. Stay out o\u2019 the way, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave his nephew a light cuff over the ear, and passed by to kneel on the rocks by Mr. Willoughby. He said something low-voiced in Chinese, and there was the ghost of a laugh from the Chinaman. Mr. Willoughby opened the side of the lantern, holding it conveniently to Jamie\u2019s cupped hands. A sharp click, repeated twice, and I caught the flicker of sparks struck from a flint.</p><p>It was a wild piece of coast\u2014not surprising, most of Scotland\u2019s coast was wild and rocky\u2014and I wondered how and where the French ship would anchor. There was no natural bay, only a curving of the coastline behind a jutting cliff that sheltered this spot from observation from the road.</p><p>Dark as it was, I could see the white lines of the surf purling in across the small half-moon beach. No smooth tourist beach this\u2014small pockets of sand lay ruffled and churned between heaps of seaweed and pebbles and juts of rock. Not an easy footing for men carrying casks, but convenient to the crevices in the surrounding rocks, where the casks could be hidden.</p><p>Another black figure loomed up suddenly beside me.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s settled, sir,\u201d it said softly. \u201cUp in the rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, Joey.\u201d A sudden flare lit Jamie\u2019s profile, intent on the newly caught wick. He held his breath as the flame steadied and grew, taking up oil from the lantern\u2019s reservoir, then let it out with a sigh as he gently closed the metal slide.</p><p>\u201cFine, then,\u201d he said, standing up. He glanced up at the cliff to the south, observing the stars over it, and said, \u201cNearly nine o\u2019clock. They\u2019ll be in soon. Mind ye, Joey\u2014no one\u2019s to move \u2019til I call out, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d The casual tone of the answer made it apparent that this was a customary exchange, and Joey was plainly surprised when Jamie gripped his arm.</p><p>\u201cBe sure of it,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cTell them all again\u2014no one moves \u2019til I give the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d Joey said again, but this time with more respect. He faded back into the night, making no sound on the rocks.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d I asked, pitching my voice barely loud enough to be heard over the breakers. Though the beach and cliffs were evidently deserted, the dark setting and the secretive conduct of my companions compelled caution.</p><p>Jamie shook his head briefly; he\u2019d been right about Young Ian, I thought\u2014his own dark silhouette was clear against the paler black of the sky behind him.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken.\u201d He hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cTell me, Sassenach\u2014d\u2019ye smell anything?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, I obligingly took a deep sniff, held it for a moment, and let it out. I smelled any number of things, including rotted seaweed, the thick smell of burning oil from the dark lantern, and the pungent body odor of Young Ian, standing close beside me, sweating with a mix of excitement and fear.</p><p>\u201cNothing odd, I don\u2019t think,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>The silhouette\u2019s shoulders rose and dropped in a shrug. \u201cNot now. A moment ago, I could ha\u2019 sworn I smelt gunpowder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna smell anything,\u201d Young Ian said. His voice broke from excitement, and he hastily cleared his throat, embarrassed. \u201cWillie MacLeod and Alec Hays searched the rocks. They didna find any sign of excisemen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice sounded uneasy. He turned to Young Ian, grasping him by the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIan, you\u2019re to take charge of your auntie, now. The two of ye get back of the gorse bushes there. Keep well away from the wagon. If anything should happen\u2014\u201d</p><p>The beginnings of Young Ian\u2019s protest were cut off, apparently by a tightening of Jamie\u2019s hand, for the boy jerked back with a small grunt, rubbing his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIf anything should happen,\u201d Jamie continued, with emphasis, \u201cyou\u2019re to take your auntie and go straight home to Lallybroch. Dinna linger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cUncle!\u201d Young Ian said.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d said Jamie, in tones of steel, and turned aside, the discussion concluded.</p><p>Young Ian was grim on the trip up the cliff trail, but did as he was told, dutifully escorting me some distance past the gorse bushes and finding a small promontory where we might see out some way over the water.</p><p>\u201cWe can see from here,\u201d he whispered unnecessarily.</p><p>We could indeed. The rocks fell away in a shallow bowl beneath us, a broken cup filled with darkness, the light of the water spilling from the broken edge where the sea hissed in. Once I caught a tiny movement, as a metal buckle caught the faint light, but for the most part, the ten men below were completely invisible.</p><p>I squinted, trying to pick out the location of Mr. Willoughby with his lantern, but saw no sign of light, and concluded that he must be standing behind the lantern, shielding it from sight from the cliff.</p><p>Young Ian stiffened suddenly next to me.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming!\u201d he whispered. \u201cQuick, get behind me!\u201d Stepping courageously out in front of me, he plunged a hand under his shirt, into the band of his breeches, and withdrew a pistol; dark as it was, I could see the faint gleam of starlight along the barrel.</p><p>He braced himself, peering into the dark, slightly hunched over the gun with both hands clamped on the weapon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d I hissed in his ear. I didn\u2019t dare grab his arm for fear of setting off the pistol, but was terrified lest he make any noise that might attract attention to the men below.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be obliged if ye\u2019d heed your auntie, Ian,\u201d came Jamie\u2019s soft, ironic tones from the blackness below the cliff edge. \u201cI\u2019d as soon not have ye blow my head off, aye?\u201d</p><p>Ian lowered the pistol, shoulders slumping with what might have been a sigh either of relief or disappointment. The gorse bushes quivered, and then Jamie was before us, brushing gorse prickles from the sleeve of his coat.</p><p>\u201cDid no one tell ye not to come armed?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was mild, with no more than a note of academic interest. \u201cIt\u2019s a hanging offense to draw a weapon against an officer of the King\u2019s Customs,\u201d he explained, turning to me. \u201cNone o\u2019 the men are armed, even wi\u2019 so much as a fish knife, in case they\u2019re taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, Fergus said they wouldna hang me, because my beard\u2019s not grown yet,\u201d Ian said awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019d only be transported, he said.\u201d</p><p>There was a soft hiss as Jamie drew in his breath through his teeth in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, and I\u2019m sure your mother will be verra pleased to hear ye\u2019ve been shipped off to the Colonies, even if Fergus was right!\u201d He put out his hand. \u201cGive me that, fool.</p><p>\u201cWhere did ye get it, anyway?\u201d he asked, turning the pistol over in his hand. \u201cAlready primed, too. I knew I smelt gunpowder. Lucky ye didna blow your c**k off, carrying it in your breeches.\u201d</p><p>Before Young Ian could answer, I interrupted, pointing out to sea.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>The French ship was little more than a blot on the face of the sea, but its sails shone pale in the glimmer of starlight. A two-masted ketch, it glided slowly past the cliff and stood off, silent as one of the scattered clouds behind it.</p><p>Jamie was not watching the ship, but looking downward, toward a point where the rock face broke in a tumble of boulders, just above the sand. Looking where he was looking, I could just make out a tiny prickle of light. Mr. Willoughby, with the lantern. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a brief flash of light that glistened across the wet rocks and was gone. Young Ian\u2019s hand was tense on my arm. We waited, breaths held, to the count of thirty. Ian\u2019s hand squeezed my arm, just as another flash lit the foam on the sand.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jamie wasn\u2019t looking at me, but out at the ship.</p><p>\u201cOn the shore; when the light flashed, I thought I saw something half-buried in the sand. It looked like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The third flash came, and a moment later, an answering light shone from the ship\u2014a blue lantern, an eerie dot that hung from the mast, doubling itself in reflection in the dark water below.</p><p>I forgot the glimpse of what appeared to be a rumpled heap of clothing, carelessly buried in the sand, in the excitement of watching the ship. Some movement was evident now, and a faint splash reached our ears as something was thrown over the side.</p><p>\u201cThe tide\u2019s coming in,\u201d Jamie muttered in my ear. \u201cThe ankers float; the current will carry them ashore in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>That solved the problem of the ship\u2019s anchorage\u2014it didn\u2019t need one. But how then was the payment made? I was about to ask when there was a sudden shout, and all hell broke loose below.</p><p>Jamie thrust his way at once through the gorse bushes, followed in short order by me and Young Ian. Little could be seen distinctly, but there was a considerable turmoil taking place on the sandy beach. Dark shapes were stumbling and rolling over the sand, to the accompaniment of shouting. I caught the words \u201cHalt, in the King\u2019s name!\u201d and my blood froze.</p> <p>\u201cExcisemen!\u201d Young Ian had caught it, too.</p><p>Jamie said something crude in Gaelic, then threw back his head and shouted himself, his voice carrying easily across the beach below.</p><p>\u201c\u00c9irich \u2019illean!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cSuas am bearrach is teich!\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to Young Ian and me. \u201cGo!\u201d he said.</p><p>The noise suddenly increased as the clatter of falling rocks joined the shouting. Suddenly a dark figure shot out of the gorse by my feet and made off through the dark at high speed. Another followed, a few feet away.</p><p>A high-pitched scream came from the dark below, high enough to be heard over the other noises.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Willoughby!\u201d Young Ian exclaimed. \u201cThey\u2019ve got him!\u201d</p><p>Ignoring Jamie\u2019s order to go, we both crowded forward to peer through the screen of gorse. The dark-lantern had fallen atilt and the slide had come open, shooting a beam of light like a spotlight over the beach, where the shallow graves in which the Customs men had buried themselves gaped in the sand. Black figures swayed and struggled and shouted through the wet heaps of seaweed. A dim glow of light around the lantern was sufficient to show two figures clasped together, the smaller kicking wildly as it was lifted off its feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him!\u201d Young Ian sprang forward, only to be pulled up with a jerk as Jamie caught him by the collar.</p><p>\u201cDo as you\u2019re told and see my wife safe!\u201d</p><p>Gasping for breath, Young Ian turned to me, but I wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and set my feet firmly in the dirt, resisting his tug on my arm.</p><p>Ignoring us both, Jamie turned and ran along the clifftop, stopping several yards away. I could see him clearly in silhouette against the sky, as he dropped to one knee and readied the pistol, bracing it on his forearm to sight downward.</p><p>The sound of the shot was no more than a small cracking noise, lost amid the tumult. The result of it, though, was spectacular. The lantern exploded in a shower of burning oil, abruptly darkening the beach and silencing the shouting.</p><p>The silence was broken within seconds by a howl of mingled pain and indignation. My eyes, momentarily blinded by the flash of the lantern, adapted quickly, and I saw another glow\u2014the light of several small flames, which seemed to be moving erratically up and down. As my night vision cleared, I saw that the flames rose from the coat sleeve of a man, who was dancing up and down as he howled, beating ineffectually at the fire started by the burning oil that had splashed him.</p> <p>The gorse bushes quivered violently as Jamie plunged over the cliffside and was lost to view below.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d</p><p>Roused by my cry, Young Ian yanked harder, pulling me half off my feet and forcibly dragging me away from the cliff.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Auntie! They\u2019ll be up here, next thing!\u201d</p><p>This was undeniably true; I could hear the shouts on the beach coming closer, as the men swarmed up the rocks. I picked up my skirts and went, following the boy as fast as we could go through the rough marrow-grass of the clifftop.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know where we were going, but Young Ian seemed to. He had taken off his coat and the white of his shirt was easily visible before me, floating like a ghost through the thickets of alder and birch that grew farther inland.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I panted, coming up alongside him when he slowed at the bank of a tiny stream.</p><p>\u201cThe road to Arbroath\u2019s just ahead,\u201d he said. He was breathing heavily, and a dark smudge of mud showed down the side of his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019ll be easier going in a moment. Are ye all right, Auntie? Shall I carry ye across?\u201d</p><p>I politely declined this gallant offer, privately noting that I undoubtedly weighed as much as he did. I took off my shoes and stockings, and splashed my way knee-deep across the streamlet, feeling icy mud well up between my toes.</p><p>I was shivering violently when I emerged, and did accept Ian\u2019s offer of his coat\u2014excited as he was, and heated by the exercise, he was clearly in no need of it. I was chilled not only by the water and the cold November wind, but by fear of what might be happening behind us.</p><p>We emerged panting onto the road, the wind blowing cold in our faces. My nose and lips were numb in no time, and my hair blew loose behind me, heavy on my neck. It\u2019s an ill wind that blows nobody good, though; it carried the sound of voices to us, moments before we would have walked into them.</p><p>\u201cAny signal from the cliff?\u201d a deep male voice asked. Ian stopped so abruptly in his tracks that I bumped into him.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d came the reply. \u201cI thought I heard a bit of shouting that way, but then the wind turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get up that tree again then, heavy-arse,\u201d the first voice said impatiently. \u201cIf any o\u2019 the whoresons get past the beach, we\u2019ll nibble \u2019em here. Better us get the headmoney than the buggers on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d grumbled the second voice. \u201cOut in the open where the wind gnaws your bones. Wish we\u2019d drawn the watch at the abbey\u2014at least it would be warm there.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s hand was clutching my upper arm tight enough to leave bruises. I pulled, trying to loosen his grip, but he paid no attention.</p><p>\u201cAye, but less chance o\u2019 catching the big fish,\u201d the first voice said. \u201cAh, and what I might do with fifty pound!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwright,\u201d said the second voice, resigned. \u201cThough how we\u2019re to see red hair in the dark, I\u2019ve no notion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust lay \u2019em by the heels, Oakie; we\u2019ll look at their heads later.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian was finally roused from his trance by my tugging, and stumbled after me off the road and into the bushes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they mean by the watch at the abbey?\u201d I demanded, as soon as I thought we were out of earshot of the watchers on the road. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s dark thatch bobbed up and down. \u201cI think so, Auntie. It must be Arbroath abbey. That\u2019s the meeting point, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf something should go wrong,\u201d he explained. \u201cThen it\u2019s every man for himself, all to meet at the abbey as soon as they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it couldn\u2019t go more wrong,\u201d I observed. \u201cWhat was it your uncle shouted when the Customs men popped up?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian had half-turned to listen for pursuit from the road;now the pale oval of his face turned back to me. \u201cOh\u2014he said, \u2018Up, lads! Over the cliff and run!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound advice,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cSo if they followed it, most of the men may have gotten away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Uncle Jamie and Mr. Willoughby.\u201d Young Ian was running one hand nervously through his hair; it reminded me forcibly of Jamie, and I wished he would stop.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing we can do about them just now. The other men, though\u2014if they\u2019re headed for the abbey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he broke in, \u201cthat\u2019s what I was tryin\u2019 to decide; ought I do as Uncle Jamie said, and take ye to Lallybroch, or had I best try to get to the abbey quick and warn the others as they come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the abbey,\u201d I said, \u201cas fast as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, but\u2014I shouldna like to leave ye out here by yourself, Auntie, and Uncle Jamie said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a time to follow orders, Young Ian, and a time to think for yourself,\u201d I said firmly, tactfully ignoring the fact that I was in fact doing the thinking for him. \u201cDoes this road lead to the abbey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it does. No more than a mile and a quarter.\u201d Already he was shifting to and fro on the balls of his feet, eager to be gone.</p><p>\u201cGood. You cut round the road and head for the abbey. I\u2019ll walk straight along the road, and see if I can distract the excisemen until you\u2019re safely past. I\u2019ll meet you at the abbey. Oh, wait\u2014you\u2019d best take your coat.\u201d</p><p>I surrendered the coat reluctantly; besides being loath to part with its warmth, it felt like giving up my last link with a friendly human presence. Once Young Ian was away, I would be completely alone in the cold dark of the Scottish night.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d I held his arm, to keep him a moment longer.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful, won\u2019t you?\u201d On impulse, I stood on tiptoe and kissed his cold cheek. I was near enough to see his brows arch in surprise. He smiled, and then he was gone, an alder branch snapping back into place behind him.</p><p>It was very cold. The only sounds were the whish of the wind through the bushes and the distant murmur of the surf. I pulled the woolen shawl tightly round my shoulders, shivering, and headed back toward the road.</p><p>Ought I to make a noise? I wondered. If not, I might be attacked without warning, since the waiting men might hear my footsteps but couldn\u2019t see that I wasn\u2019t an escaping smuggler. On the other hand, if I strolled through singing a jaunty tune to indicate that I was a harmless woman, they might just lie hidden in silence, not wanting to give away their presence\u2014and giving away their presence was exactly what I had in mind. I bent and picked up a rock from the side of the road. Then, feeling even colder than before, I stepped out onto the road and walked straight on, without a word.</p><p>31</p><p>SMUGGLERS\u2019 MOON</p><p>The wind was high enough to keep the trees and bushes in a constant stir, masking the sound of my footsteps on the road\u2014and those of anyone who might be stalking me, too. Less than a fortnight past the feast of Samhain, it was the sort of wild night that made one easily believe that spirits and evil might well be abroad.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a spirit that grabbed me suddenly from behind, hand clamped tight across my mouth. Had I not been prepared for just such an eventuality, I would have been startled senseless. As it was, my heart gave a great leap and I jerked convulsively in my captor\u2019s grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had grabbed me from the left, pinning my left arm tight against my side, his right hand over my mouth. My right arm was free, though. I drove the heel of my shoe into his kneecap, buckling his leg, and then, taking advantage of his momentary stagger, leaned forward and smashed backward at his head with the rock in my hand.</p><p>It was of necessity a glancing blow, but it struck hard enough that he grunted with surprise, and his grip loosened. I kicked and squirmed, and as his hand slipped across my mouth, I got my teeth onto a finger and bit down as hard as I could.</p><p>\u201cThe maxillary muscles run from the sagittal crest at the top of the skull to an insertion on the mandible,\u201d I thought, dimly recalling the description from Grey\u2019s Anatomy. \u201cThis gives the jaw and teeth considerable crushing power; in fact, the average human jaw is capable of exerting over three hundred pounds of force.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether I was bettering the average, but I was undeniably having an effect. My assailant was thrashing frantically to and fro in a futile effort to dislodge the death grip I had on his finger.</p> <p>His hold on my arm had loosened in the struggle, and he was forced to lower me. As soon as my feet touched the dirt once more, I let go of his hand, whirled about, and gave him as hearty a root in the stones with my knee as I could manage, given my skirts.</p><p>Kicking men in the testicles is vastly overrated as a means of defense. That is to say, it does work\u2014and spectacularly well\u2014but it\u2019s a more difficult maneuver to carry out than one might think, particularly when one is wearing heavy skirts. Men are extremely careful of those particular appendages, and thoroughly wary of any attempt on them.</p><p>In this case, though, my attacker was off guard, his legs wide apart to keep his balance, and I caught him fairly. He made a hideous wheezing noise like a strangled rabbit and doubled up in the roadway.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Sassenach?\u201d The words were hissed out of the darkness to my left. I leaped like a startled gazelle, and uttered an involuntary scream.</p><p>For the second time within as many minutes, a hand clapped itself over my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Sassenach!\u201d Jamie muttered in my ear. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d I didn\u2019t bite him, though I was strongly tempted to.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, through my teeth, when he released me. \u201cWho\u2019s the other fellow that grabbed me, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus, I expect.\u201d The amorphous dark shape moved away a few feet and seemed to be prodding another shape that lay on the road, moaning faintly. \u201cIs it you, Fergus?\u201d he whispered. Receiving a sort of choked noise in response, he bent and hauled the second shape to its feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk!\u201d I urged them in a whisper. \u201cThere are excisemen just ahead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d said Jamie, in a normal voice. \u201cThey\u2019re no verra curious about the noise we\u2019re making, are they?\u201d</p><p>He paused, as though waiting for an answer, but no sound came but the low keening of the wind through the alders. He laid a hand on my arm and shouted into the night.</p> <p>\u201cMacLeod! Raeburn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Roy,\u201d said a mildly testy voice in the shrubbery. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Innes, too, and Meldrum, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Shuffling and talking in low voices, more shapes emerged from the bushes and trees.</p><p>\u201c...four, five, six,\u201d Jamie counted. \u201cWhere are Hays and the Gordons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Hays go intae the water,\u201d one of the shapes volunteered. \u201cHe\u2019ll ha\u2019 gone awa\u2019 round the point. Likely the Gordons and Kennedy did, too. I didna hear anything as though they\u2019d been taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cNow, then, Sassenach. What\u2019s this about excisemen?\u201d</p><p>Given the nonappearance of Oakie and his companion, I was beginning to feel rather foolish, but I recounted what Ian and I had heard.</p> <p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie sounded interested. \u201cCan ye stand yet, Fergus? Ye can? Good lad. Well, then, perhaps we\u2019ll have a look. Meldrum, have ye a flint about ye?\u201d</p><p>A few moments later, a small torch struggling to stay alight in his hand, he strode down the road, and around the bend. The smugglers and I waited in tense silence, ready either to run or to rush to his assistance, but there were no noises of ambush. After what seemed like an eternity, Jamie\u2019s voice floated back along the road.</p><p>\u201cCome along, then,\u201d he said, sounding calm and collected.</p><p>He was standing in the middle of the road, near a large alder. The torchlight fell round him in a flickering circle, and at first I saw nothing but Jamie. Then there was a gasp from the man beside me, and a choked sound of horror from another.</p><p>Another face appeared, dimly lit, hanging in the air just behind Jamie\u2019s left shoulder. A horrible, congested face, black in the torchlight that robbed everything of color, with bulging eyes and tongue protruding. The hair, fair as dry straw, rose stirring in the wind. I felt a fresh scream rise in my throat, and choked it off.</p><p>\u201cYe were right, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cThere was an exciseman.\u201d He tossed something to the ground, where it landed with a small plop! \u201cA warrant,\u201d he said, nodding toward the object. \u201cHis name was Thomas Oakie. Will any of ye ken him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like he is now,\u201d a voice muttered behind me. \u201cChrist, his mither wouldna ken him!\u201d There was a general mutter of negation, with a nervous shuffling of feet. Clearly, everyone was as anxious to get away from the place as I was.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Jamie stopped the retreat with a jerk of his head. \u201cThe cargo\u2019s lost, so there\u2019ll be no shares, aye? Will anyone need money for the present?\u201d He reached for his pocket. \u201cI can provide enough to live on for a bit\u2014for I doubt we\u2019ll be workin\u2019 the coast for a time.\u201d</p><p>One or two of the men reluctantly advanced within clear sight of the thing hanging from the tree to receive their money, but the rest of the smugglers melted quietly away into the night. Within a few minutes, only Fergus\u2014still white, but standing on his own\u2014Jamie, and I were left.</p><p>\u201cJesu!\u201d Fergus whispered, looking up at the hanged man. \u201cWho will have done it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did\u2014or so I expect the tale will be told, aye?\u201d Jamie gazed upward, his face harsh in the sputtering torchlight. \u201cWe\u2019ll no tarry longer, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ian?\u201d I said, suddenly remembering the boy. \u201cHe went to the abbey, to warn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice sharpened. \u201cI came from that direction, and didna meet him. Which way did he go, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d I said, pointing.</p><p>Fergus made a small sound that might have been laughter.</p><p>\u201cThe abbey\u2019s the other way,\u201d Jamie said, sounding amused. \u201cCome on, then; we\u2019ll catch him up when he realizes his mistake and comes back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d said Fergus, holding up a hand. There was a cautious rustling in the shrubbery, and Young Ian\u2019s voice said, \u201cUncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Ian,\u201d his uncle said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The boy emerged from the bushes, leaves stuck in his hair, eyes wide with excitement.</p><p>\u201cI saw the light, and thought I must come back to see that Auntie Claire was all right,\u201d he explained. \u201cUncle Jamie, ye mustna linger about wi\u2019 a torch\u2014there are excisemen about!\u201d</p><p>Jamie put an arm about his nephew\u2019s shoulders and turned him, before he should notice the thing hanging from the alder tree.</p><p>\u201cDinna trouble yourself, Ian,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone.\u201d</p><p>Swinging the torch through the wet shrubbery, he extinguished it with a hiss.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, his voice calm in the dark. \u201cMr. Willoughby\u2019s down the road wi\u2019 the horses; we\u2019ll be in the Highlands by dawn.\u201d</p><p>PART SEVEN</p><p>Home Again</p><p>32</p><p>THE PRODIGAL\u2019S RETURN</p><p>It was a four-day journey on horseback to Lallybroch from Arbroath, and there was little conversation for most of it. Both Young Ian and Jamie were preoccupied, presumably for different reasons. For myself, I was kept busy wondering, not only about the recent past, but about the immediate future.</p><p>Ian must have told Jamie\u2019s sister, Jenny, about me. How would she take my reappearance?</p><p>Jenny Murray had been the nearest thing I had ever had to a sister, and by far the closest woman friend of my life. Owing to circumstance, most of my close friends in the last fifteen years had been men; there were no other female doctors, and the natural gulf between nursing staff and medical staff prevented more than casual acquaintance with other women working at the hospital. As for the women in Frank\u2019s circle, the departmental secretaries and university wives...</p><p>More than any of that, though, was the knowledge that of all the people in the world, Jenny was the one who might love Jamie Fraser as much\u2014if not more\u2014than I did. I was eager to see Jenny again, but could not help wondering how she would take the story of my supposed escape to France, and my apparent desertion of her brother.</p><p>The horses had to follow each other in single file down the narrow track. My own bay slowed obligingly as Jamie\u2019s chestnut paused, then turned aside at his urging into a clearing, half-hidden by an overhang of alder branches.</p><p>A gray stone cliff rose up at the edge of the clearing, its cracks and bumps and ridges so furred with moss and lichen that it looked like the face of an ancient man, all spotted with whiskers and freckled with warts. Young Ian slid down from his pony with a sigh of relief; we had been in the saddle since dawn.</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d he said, frankly rubbing his backside. \u201cI\u2019ve gone all numb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I,\u201d I said, doing the same. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s better than being saddlesore, though.\u201d Unaccustomed to riding for long stretches, both Young Ian and I had suffered considerably during the first two days of the journey; in fact, too stiff to dismount by myself the first night, I had had to be ignominiously hoisted off my horse and carried into the inn by Jamie, much to his amusement.</p><p>\u201cHow does Uncle Jamie do it?\u201d Ian asked me. \u201cHis arse must be made of leather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to look at,\u201d I replied absently. \u201cWhere\u2019s he gone, though?\u201d The chestnut, already hobbled, was nibbling at the grass under an oak to one side of the clearing, but of Jamie himself, there was no sign.</p><p>Young Ian and I looked blankly at each other; I shrugged, and went over to the cliff face, where a trickle of water ran down the rock. I cupped my hands beneath it and drank, grateful for the cold liquid sliding down my dry throat, in spite of the autumn air that reddened my cheeks and numbed my nose.</p><p>This tiny glen clearing, invisible from the road, was characteristic of most of the Highland scenery, I thought. Deceptively barren and severe, the crags and moors were full of secrets. If you didn\u2019t know where you were going, you could walk within inches of a deer, a grouse, or a hiding man, and never know it. Small wonder that many of those who had taken to the heather after Culloden had managed to escape, their knowledge of the hidden places making them invisible to the blind eyes and clumsy feet of the pursuing English. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thirst slaked, I turned from the cliff face and nearly ran into Jamie, who had appeared as though sprung out of the earth by magic. He was putting his tinderbox back into the pocket of his coat, and the faint smell of smoke clung to his coat. He dropped a small burnt stick to the grass and ground it to dust with his foot.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d I said, blinking at this apparition. \u201cAnd where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a wee cave just there,\u201d he explained, jerking a thumb behind him. \u201cI only wanted to see whether anyone\u2019s been in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they?\u201d Looking closely, I could see the edge of the outcrop that concealed the cave\u2019s entrance. Blending as it did with the other deep cracks in the rock face, it wouldn\u2019t be visible unless you were deliberately looking for it.</p> <p>\u201cAye, they have,\u201d he said. His brows were slightly furrowed, not in worry, but as though he were thinking about something. \u201cThere\u2019s charcoal mixed wi\u2019 the earth; someone\u2019s had a fire there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you think it was?\u201d I asked. I stuck my head around the outcrop, but saw nothing but a narrow bar of darkness, a small rift in the face of the mountain. It looked thoroughly uninviting.</p><p>I wondered whether any of his smuggling connections might have traced him all the way from the coast to Lallybroch. Was he worried about pursuit, or an ambush? Despite myself, I looked over my shoulder, but saw nothing but the alders, dry leaves rustling in the autumn breeze.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he said absently. \u201cA hunter, I suppose; there are grouse bones scattered about, too.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t seem perturbed by the unknown person\u2019s possible identity, and I relaxed, the feeling of security engendered by the Highlands wrapping itself about me once more. Both Edinburgh and the smugglers\u2019 cove seemed a long way away.</p> <p>Young Ian, fascinated by the revelation of the invisible cave, had disappeared through the crevice. Now he reappeared, brushing a cobweb out of his hair.</p><p>\u201cIs this like Cluny\u2019s Cage, Uncle?\u201d he asked, eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cNone so big, Ian,\u201d Jamie answered with a smile. \u201cPoor Cluny would scarce fit through the entrance o\u2019 this one; he was a stout big fellow, forbye, near twice my girth.\u201d He touched his chest ruefully, where a button had been torn loose by squeezing through the narrow entrance.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Cluny\u2019s Cage?\u201d I asked, shaking the last drops of icy water from my hands and thrusting them under my armpits to thaw out.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s Cluny MacPherson,\u201d Jamie replied. He bent his head, and splashed the chilly water up into his face. Lifting his head, he blinked the sparkling drops from his lashes and smiled at me. \u201cA verra ingenious man, Cluny. The English burnt his house, and pulled down the foundation, but Cluny himself escaped. He built himself a wee snuggery in a nearby cavern, and sealed over the entrance wi\u2019 willow branches all woven together and chinked wi\u2019 mud. Folk said ye could stand three feet away, and no notion that the cave was there, save the smell of the smoke from Cluny\u2019s pipe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Charles stayed there too, for a bit, when he was hunted by the English,\u201d Young Ian informed me. \u201cCluny hid him for days. The English bastards hunted high and low, but never found His Highness\u2014or Cluny, either!\u201d he concluded, with considerable satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cCome here and wash yourself, Ian,\u201d Jamie said, with a hint of sharpness that made Young Ian blink. \u201cYe canna face your parents covered wi\u2019 filth.\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed, but obediently bent his head over the trickle of water, sputtering and gasping as he splashed his face, which while not strictly speaking filthy, undeniably bore one or two small stains of travel.</p><p>I turned to Jamie, who stood watching his nephew\u2019s ablutions with an air of abstraction. Did he look ahead, I wondered, to what promised to be an awkward meeting at Lallybroch, or back to Edinburgh, with the smoldering remains of his printshop and the dead man in the basement of the brothel? Or back further still, to Charles Edward Stuart, and the days of the Rising?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you tell your nieces and nephews about him?\u201d I asked quietly, under the noise of Ian\u2019s snorting. \u201cAbout Charles?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s gaze sharpened and focused on me; I had been right, then. His eyes warmed slightly, and the hint of a smile acknowledged the success of my mind-reading, but then both warmth and smile disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI never speak of him,\u201d he said, just as quietly, and turned away to catch the horses.</p><p>Three hours later, we came through the last of the windswept passes, and out onto the final slope that led down to Lallybroch. Jamie, in the lead, drew up his horse and waited for me and Young Ian to come up beside him.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d he said. He glanced at me, smiling, one eyebrow raised. \u201cMuch changed, is it?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, rapt. From this distance, the house seemed completely unchanged. Built of white harled stone, its three stories gleamed immaculately amid its cluster of shabby outbuildings and the spread of stone-dyked brown fields. On the small rise behind the house stood the remains of the ancient broch, the circular stone tower that gave the place its name.</p><p>On closer inspection, I could see that the outbuildings had changed a bit; Jamie had told me that the English soldiery had burned the dovecote and the chapel the year after Culloden, and I could see the gaps where they had been. A space where the wall of the kailyard had been broken through had been repaired with stone of a different color, and a new shed built of stone and scrap lumber was evidently serving as a dovecote, judging from the row of plump feathered bodies lined up on the rooftree, enjoying the late autumn sun.</p><p>The rose brier planted by Jamie\u2019s mother, Ellen, had grown up into a great, sprawling tangle latticed to the wall of the house, only now losing the last of its leaves.</p><p>A plume of smoke rose from the western chimney, carrying away toward the south on a wind from the sea. I had a sudden vision of the fire in the hearth of the sitting room, its light rosy on Jenny\u2019s clear-cut face in the evening as she sat in her chair, reading aloud from a novel or book of poems while Jamie and Ian sat absorbed in a game of chess, listening with half an ear. How many evenings had we spent that way, the children upstairs in their beds, and me sitting at the rosewood secretary, writing down receipts for medicines or doing some of the interminable domestic mending?</p><p>\u201cWill we live here again, do you think?\u201d I asked Jamie, careful to keep any trace of longing from my voice. More than any other place, the house at Lallybroch had been home to me, but that had been a long time ago\u2014and any number of things had changed since then.</p><p>He paused for a long minute, considering. Finally he shook his head, gathering up the reins in his hand. \u201cI canna say, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be pleasant, but\u2014I dinna ken how things may be, aye?\u201d There was a small frown on his face, as he looked down at the house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. If we live in Edinburgh\u2014or even in France\u2014it\u2019s all right, Jamie.\u201d I looked up into his face and touched his hand in reassurance. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>The faint look of worry lifted momentarily, lightening his features. He took my hand, raised it to his lips, and kissed it gently.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mind much else myself, Sassenach, so long as ye\u2019ll stay by me.\u201d</p><p>We sat gazing into each other\u2019s eyes, until a loud, self-conscious cough from behind alerted us to Young Ian\u2019s presence. Scrupulously careful of our privacy, he had been embarrassingly circumspect on the trip from Edinburgh, crashing off through the heather to a great distance when we camped, and taking remarkable pains so as not inadvertently to surprise us in an indiscreet embrace.</p><p>Jamie grinned and squeezed my hand before letting it go and turning to his nephew.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there, Ian,\u201d he said, as the boy negotiated his pony up beside us. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there well before supper if it doesna rain,\u201d he added, squinting under his hand to gauge the possibilities of the clouds drifting slowly over the Monadhliath Mountains.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Young Ian didn\u2019t sound thrilled at the prospect, and I glanced at him sympathetically.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Home is the place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in,\u2019\u201d I quoted.</p><p>Young Ian gave me a wry look. \u201cAye, that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of, Auntie.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, hearing this exchange, glanced back at Young Ian, and blinked solemnly\u2014his own version of an encouraging wink.</p><p>\u201cDinna be downhearted, Ian. Remember the story o\u2019 the Prodigal Son, aye? Your Mam will be glad to see ye safe back.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian cast him a glance of profound disillusion.</p><p>\u201cIf ye expect it\u2019s the fatted calf that\u2019s like to be kilt, Uncle Jamie, ye dinna ken my mother so well as ye think.\u201d</p><p>The lad sat gnawing his lower lip for a moment, then drew himself up in the saddle with a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cBest get it over, aye?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWill his parents really be hard on him?\u201d I asked, watching Young Ian pick his way carefully down the rocky slope.</p><p>Jamie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019ll forgive him, of course, but he\u2019s like to get a rare ballocking and his backside tanned before that. I\u2019ll be lucky to get off wi\u2019 the same,\u201d he added wryly. \u201cJenny and Ian are no going to be verra pleased wi\u2019 me, either, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He kicked up his mount, and started down the slope.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Sassenach. Best get it over, aye?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect in terms of a reception at Lallybroch, but in the event, it was reassuring. As on all previous arrivals, our presence was heralded by the barking of a miscellaneous swarm of dogs, who galloped out of hedge and field and kailyard, yapping first with alarm, and then with joy.</p><p>Young Ian dropped his reins and slid down into the furry sea of welcome, dropping into a crouch to greet the dogs who leapt on him and licked his face. He stood up smiling with a half-grown puppy in his arms, which he brought over to show me.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jocky,\u201d he said, holding up the squirming brown and white body. \u201cHe\u2019s mine; Da gave him to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice doggie,\u201d I told Jocky, scratching his floppy ears. The dog barked and squirmed ecstatically, trying to lick me and Ian simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting covered wi\u2019 dog hairs, Ian,\u201d said a clear, high voice, in tones of marked disapproval. Looking up from the dog, I saw a tall, slim girl of seventeen or so, rising from her seat by the side of the road.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re covered wi\u2019 foxtails, so there!\u201d Young Ian retorted, swinging about to address the speaker.</p><p>The girl tossed a headful of dark brown curls and bent to brush at her skirt, which did indeed sport a number of the bushy grass-heads, stuck to the homespun fabric.</p><p>\u201cDa says ye dinna deserve to have a dog,\u201d she remarked. \u201cRunning off and leaving him like ye did.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s face tightened defensively. \u201cI did think o\u2019 taking him,\u201d he said, voice cracking slightly. \u201cBut I didna think he\u2019d be safe in the city.\u201d He hugged the dog tighter, chin resting between the furry ears. \u201cHe\u2019s grown a bit; I suppose he\u2019s been eating all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome to greet us, have ye, wee Janet? That\u2019s kind.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice spoke pleasantly from behind me, but with a cynical note that made the girl glance up sharply and blush at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie! Oh, and...\u201d Her gaze shifted to me, and she ducked her head, blushing more furiously.</p><p>\u201cAye, this is your auntie Claire.\u201d Jamie\u2019s hand was firm under my elbow as he nodded toward the girl. \u201cWee Janet wasna born yet, last ye were here, Sassenach. Your mother will be to home, I expect?\u201d he said, addressing Janet.</p><p>The girl nodded, wide-eyed, not taking her fascinated gaze from my face. I leaned down from my horse and extended a hand, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you,\u201d I said.</p><p>She stared for a long moment, then suddenly remembered her manners, and dropped into a curtsy. She rose and took my hand gingerly, as though afraid it might come off in her grasp. I squeezed hers, and she looked faintly reassured at finding me merely flesh and blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...pleased, mum,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre Mam and Da verra angry, Jen?\u201d Young Ian gently put the puppy on the ground near her feet, breaking her trance. She glanced at her younger brother, her expression of impatience tinged with some sympathy.</p><p>\u201cWell, and why wouldn\u2019t they be, clot-heid?\u201d she said. \u201cMam thought ye\u2019d maybe met a boar in the wood, or been taken by gypsies. She scarcely slept until they found out where ye\u2019d gone,\u201d she added, frowning at her brother.</p> <p>Ian pressed his lips tight together, looking down at the ground, but didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>She moved closer, and picked disapprovingly at the damp yellow leaves adhering to the sleeves of his coat. Tall as she was, he topped her by a good six inches, gangly and rawboned next to her trim competence, the resemblance between them limited to the rich darkness of their hair and a fugitive similarity of expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sight, Ian. Have ye been sleepin\u2019 in your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I have,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye think, I ran away wi\u2019 a nightshirt and changed into it every night on the moor?\u201d</p><p>She gave a brief snort of laughter at this picture, and his expression of annoyance faded a bit.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, then, gowk,\u201d she said, taking pity on him. \u201cCome into the scullery wi\u2019 me, and we\u2019ll get ye brushed and combed before Mam and Da see ye.\u201d</p> <p>He glared at her, then turned to look up at me, with an expression of mingled bewilderment and annoyance. \u201cWhy in the name o\u2019 heaven,\u201d he demanded, his voice cracking with strain, \u201cdoes everyone think bein\u2019 clean will help?\u201d</p><p>Jamie grinned at him, and dismounting, clapped him on the shoulder, raising a small cloud of dust.</p><p>\u201cIt canna hurt anything, Ian. Go along wi\u2019 ye; I think perhaps it\u2019s as well if your parents havena got so many things to deal with all at once\u2014and they\u2019ll be wanting to see your auntie first of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d With a morose nod of assent, Young Ian moved reluctantly off toward the back of the house, towed by his determined sister.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye been eating?\u201d I heard her say, squinting up at him as they went. \u201cYou\u2019ve a great smudge of filth all round your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isna filth, it\u2019s whiskers!\u201d he hissed furiously under his breath, with a quick backward glance to see whether Jamie and I had heard this exchange. His sister stopped dead, peering up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhiskers?\u201d she said loudly and incredulously. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Grabbing her by the elbow, he hustled her off through the kailyard gate, his shoulders hunched in self-consciousness.</p> <p>Jamie lowered his head against my thigh, face buried in my skirts. To the casual observer, he might have been occupied in loosening the saddlebags, but the casual observer couldn\u2019t have seen his shoulders shaking or felt the vibration of his soundless laughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, they\u2019re gone,\u201d I said, a moment later, gasping for breath myself from the strain of silent mirth.</p><p>Jamie raised his face, red and breathless, from my skirts, and used a fold of the cloth to dab his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhiskers? You?\u201d he croaked in imitation of his niece, setting us both off again. He shook his head, gulping for air. \u201cChrist, she\u2019s like her mother! That\u2019s just what Jenny said to me, in just that voice, when she caught me shavin\u2019 for the first time. I nearly cut my throat.\u201d He wiped his eyes again on the back of his hand, and rubbed a palm tenderly across the thick, soft stubble that coated his own jaws and throat with an auburn haze.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go and shave yourself before we meet Jenny and Ian?\u201d I asked, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smoothing back the hair that had escaped from its lacing. \u201cYoung Ian\u2019s right; bein\u2019 clean won\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>They must have heard the dogs outside; both Ian and Jenny were in the sitting room when we came in, she on the sofa knitting woolen stockings, while he stood before the fire in plain brown coat and breeks, warming the backs of his legs. A tray of small cakes with a bottle of home-brewed ale was set out, plainly in readiness for our arrival.</p><p>It was a very cozy, welcoming scene, and I felt the tiredness of the journey drop away as we entered the room. Ian turned at once as we came in, self-conscious but smiling, but it was Jenny that I looked for.</p><p>She was looking for me, too. She sat still on the couch, her eyes wide, turned to the door. My first impression was that she was quite different, the second, that she had not changed at all. The black curls were still there, thick and lively, but blanched and streaked with a deep, rich silver. The bones, too, were the same\u2014the broad, high cheekbones, strong jaw, and long nose that she shared with Jamie. It was the flickering firelight and the shadows of the gathering afternoon that gave the strange impression of change, one moment deepening the lines beside her eyes and mouth \u2019til she looked like a crone; the next erasing them with the ruddy glow of girlhood, like a 3-D picture in a box of Cracker Jack.</p><p>On our first meeting in the brothel, Ian had acted as if I were a ghost. Jenny did much the same now, blinking slightly, her mouth slightly open, but not otherwise changing expression as I crossed the room toward her.</p><p>Jamie was just behind me, his hand at my elbow. He squeezed it lightly as we reached the sofa, then let go. I felt rather as though I were being presented at Court, and resisted the impulse to curtsy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home, Jenny,\u201d he said. His hand rested reassuringly on my back.</p><p>She glanced quickly at her brother, then stared at me again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you, then, Claire?\u201d Her voice was soft and tentative, familiar, but not the strong voice of the woman I remembered.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me,\u201d I said. I smiled and reached out my hands to her. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Jenny.\u201d</p><p>She took my hands, lightly. Then her grip strengthened and she rose to her feet. \u201cChrist, it is you!\u201d she said, a little breathless, and suddenly the woman I had known was back, dark blue eyes alive and dancing, searching my face with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course it is,\u201d Jamie said gruffly. \u201cSurely Ian told ye; did ye think he was lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll scarce have changed,\u201d she said, ignoring her brother as she touched my face wonderingly. \u201cYour hair\u2019s a bit lighter, but my God, ye look the same!\u201d Her fingers were cool; her hands smelled of herbs and red-currant jam, and the faint hint of ammonia and lanolin from the dyed wool she was knitting.</p><p>The long-forgotten smell of the wool brought everything back at once\u2014so many memories of the place, and the happiness of the time I had lived here\u2014and my eyes blurred with tears.</p><p>She saw it, and hugged me hard, her hair smooth and soft against my face. She was much shorter than I, fine-boned and delicate to look at, but still I had the feeling of being enveloped, warmly supported and strongly held, as though by someone larger than myself.</p><p>She released me after a moment, and stood back, half-laughing. \u201cGod, ye even smell the same!\u201d she exclaimed, and I burst out laughing, too.</p><p>Ian had come up; he leaned down and embraced me gently, brushing his lips against my cheek. He smelled faintly of dried hay and cabbage leaves, with the ghost of peat smoke laid over his own deep, musky scent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see ye back again, Claire,\u201d he said. His soft brown eyes smiled at me, and the sense of homecoming deepened. He stood back a little awkwardly, smiling. \u201cWill ye eat something, maybe?\u201d He gestured toward the tray on the table.</p><p>I hesitated a moment, but Jamie moved toward it with alacrity.</p><p>\u201cA drop wouldna come amiss, Ian, thank ye kindly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have some, Claire?\u201d</p><p>Glasses were filled, the biscuits passed, and small spoken pleasantries murmured through mouthfuls as we sat down around the fire. Despite the outward cordiality, I was strongly aware of an underlying tension, not all of it to do with my sudden reappearance.</p><p>Jamie, seated beside me on the oak settle, took no more than a sip of his ale, and the oatcake sat untasted on his knee. I knew he hadn\u2019t accepted the refreshments out of hunger, but in order to mask the fact that neither his sister nor his brother-in-law had offered him a welcoming embrace.</p><p>I caught a quick glance passing between Ian and Jenny; and a longer stare, unreadable, exchanged between Jenny and Jamie. A stranger here in more ways than one, I kept my own eyes cast down, observing under the shelter of my lashes. Jamie sat to my left; I could feel the tiny movement between us as the two stiff fingers of his right hand drummed their small tattoo against his thigh.</p><p>The conversation, what there was of it, petered out, and the room fell into an uncomfortable silence. Through the faint hissing of the peat fire, I could hear a few distant thumps in the direction of the kitchen, but nothing like the sounds I remembered in this house, of constant activity and bustling movement, feet always pounding on the stair, and the shouts of children and squalling of babies splitting the air in the nursery overhead.</p><p>\u201cHow are all of your children?\u201d I asked Jenny, to break the silence. She started, and I realized that I had inadvertently asked the wrong question.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re well enough,\u201d she replied hesitantly. \u201cAll verra bonny. And the grandchildren, too,\u201d she added, breaking into a sudden smile at the thought of them.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve mostly gone to Young Jamie\u2019s house,\u201d Ian put in, answering my real question. \u201cHis wife\u2019s had a new babe just the week past, so the three girls have gone to help a bit. And Michael\u2019s up in Inverness just now, to fetch down some things come in from France.\u201d</p><p>Another glance flicked across the room, this one between Ian and Jamie. I felt the small tilt of Jamie\u2019s head, and saw Ian\u2019s not-quite-nod in response. And what in hell was that about? I wondered. There were so many invisible cross-currents of emotion in the room that I had a sudden impulse to stand up and call the meeting to order, just to break the tension.</p><p>Apparently Jamie felt the same. He cleared his throat, looking directly at Ian, and addressed the main point on the agenda, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve brought the lad home with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian took a deep breath, his long, homely face hardening slightly. \u201cHave ye, then?\u201d The thin layer of pleasantry spread over the occasion vanished suddenly, like morning dew.</p><p>I could feel Jamie beside me, tensing slightly as he prepared to defend his nephew as best he might.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good lad, Ian,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs he, so?\u201d It was Jenny who answered, her fine black brows drawn down in a frown. \u201cYe couldna tell, the way he acts at home. But perhaps he\u2019s different wi\u2019 you, Jamie.\u201d There was a strong note of accusation in her words, and I felt Jamie tense at my side.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of ye to speak up for the lad, Jamie,\u201d Ian put in, with a cool nod in his brother-in-law\u2019s direction. \u201cBut I think we\u2019d best hear from Young Ian himself, if ye please. Will he be upstairs?\u201d</p><p>A muscle near Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched, but he answered noncommittally. \u201cIn the scullery, I expect; he wanted to tidy himself a bit before seein\u2019 ye.\u201d His right hand slid down and pressed against my leg in warning. He hadn\u2019t mentioned meeting Janet, and I understood; she had been sent away with her siblings, so that Jenny and Ian could deal with the matters of my appearance and their prodigal son in some privacy, but had crept back unbeknownst to her parents, wanting either to catch a glimpse of her notorious aunt Claire, or to offer succor to her brother.</p><p>I lowered my eyelids, indicating that I understood. No point in mentioning the girl\u2019s presence, in a situation already so fraught with tension.</p><p>The sound of feet and the regular thump of Ian\u2019s wooden leg sounded in the uncarpeted passage. Ian had left the room in the direction of the scullery; now he returned, grimly ushering Young Ian before him.</p><p>The prodigal was as presentable as soap, water, and razor could make him. His bony jaws were reddened with scraping and the hair on his neck was clotted in wet spikes, most of the dust beaten from his coat, and the round neck of his shirt neatly buttoned to the collarbone. There was little to be done about the singed half of his head, but the other side was neatly combed. He had no stock, and there was a large rip in the leg of his breeks, but all things considered, he looked as well as someone could who expects momentarily to be shot.</p> <p>\u201cMam,\u201d he said, ducking his head awkwardly in his mother\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d she said softly, and he looked up at her, clearly startled at the gentleness of her tone. A slight smile curved her lips as she saw his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe home, mo chridhe,\u201d she said.</p><p>The boy\u2019s face cleared abruptly, as though he had just heard the reprieve read to the firing squad. Then he caught a glimpse of his father\u2019s face, and stiffened. He swallowed hard, and bent his head again, staring hard at the floorboards.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Ian said. He sounded sternly Scotch; much more like the Reverend Campbell than the easygoing man I had known before. \u201cNow then, I want to hear what ye\u2019ve got to say for yourself, laddie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well...I...\u201d Young Ian trailed off miserably, then cleared his throat and had another try. \u201cWell...nothing, really, Father,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d Ian said sharply. His son reluctantly raised his head and looked at his father, but his gaze kept flicking away, as though afraid to rest very long on the stern countenance before him.</p> <p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken what ye did to your mother?\u201d Ian demanded. \u201cDisappeared and left her thinkin\u2019 ye dead or hurt? Gone off without a word, and not a smell of ye for three days, until Joe Fraser brought down the letter ye left? Can ye even think what those three days were like for her?\u201d</p><p>Either Ian\u2019s expression or his words seemed to have a strong effect on his errant offspring; Young Ian bowed his head again, eyes fixed on the floor.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I thought Joe would bring the letter sooner,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cAye, that letter!\u201d Ian\u2019s face was growing more flushed as he talked.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Gone to Edinburgh,\u2019 it said, cool as dammit.\u201d He slapped a hand flat on the table, with a smack that made everyone jump. \u201cGone to Edinburgh! Not a \u2018by your leave,\u2019 not an \u2018I\u2019ll send word,\u2019 not a thing but \u2018Dear Mother, I have gone to Edinburgh. Ian\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Young Ian\u2019s head snapped up, eyes bright with anger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true! I said \u2018Don\u2019t worry for me,\u2019 and I said \u2018Love, Ian\u2019! I did! Did I no, Mother?\u201d For the first time, he looked at Jenny, appealing.</p><p>She had been still as a stone since her husband began to talk, her face smooth and blank. Now her eyes softened, and the hint of a curve touched her wide, full mouth again.</p> <p>\u201cYe did, Ian,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt was kind to say\u2014but I did worry, aye?\u201d</p><p>His eyes fell, and I could see the oversized Adam\u2019s apple bobble in his lean throat as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mam,\u201d he said, so low I could scarcely hear him. \u201cI\u2014I didna mean...\u201d his words trailed off, ending in a small shrug.</p><p>Jenny made an impulsive movement, as though to extend a hand to him, but Ian caught her eye, and she let the hand fall to her lap.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Ian said, speaking slowly and precisely, \u201cit\u2019s no the first time, is it, Ian?\u201d</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t answer, but made a small twitching movement that might have been assent. Ian took a step closer to his son. Close as they were in height, the differences between them were obvious. Ian was tall and lanky, but firmly muscled for all that, and a powerful man, wooden leg or no. By comparison, his son seemed almost frail, fledgling-boned and gawky.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not as though ye had no idea what ye were doing; not like we\u2019d never told ye the dangers, not like we\u2019d no forbidden ye to go past Broch Mordha\u2014not like ye didna ken we\u2019d worry, aye? Ye kent all that\u2014and ye did it anyway.\u201d</p><p>This merciless analysis of his behavior caused a sort of indefinite quiver, like an internal squirm, to go through Young Ian, but he kept up a stubborn silence.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, laddie, when I\u2019m speakin\u2019 to ye!\u201d The boy\u2019s head rose slowly. He looked sullen now, but resigned; evidently he had been through scenes like this before, and knew where they were heading.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask your uncle what ye\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI can only hope ye weren\u2019t such a fool in Edinburgh as ye\u2019ve been here. But ye\u2019ve disobeyed me outright, and broken your mother\u2019s heart, whatever else ye\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Jenny moved again, as though to speak, but a brusque movement of Ian\u2019s hand stopped her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did I tell ye the last time, wee Ian? What did I say when I gave ye your whipping? You tell me that, Ian!\u201d</p><p>The bones in Young Ian\u2019s face stood out, but he kept his mouth shut, sealed in a stubborn line.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d Ian roared, slamming his hand on the table again.</p><p>Young Ian blinked in reflex, and his shoulder blades drew together, then apart, as though he were trying to alter his size, and unsure whether to grow larger or try to be smaller. He swallowed hard, and blinked once more.</p><p>\u201cYe said\u2014ye said ye\u2019d skin me. Next time.\u201d His voice broke in a ridiculous squeak on the last word, and he clamped his mouth hard shut on it.</p><p>Ian shook his head in heavy disapproval. \u201cAye. And I thought ye\u2019d have enough sense to see there was no next time, but I was wrong about that, hm?\u201d He breathed in heavily and let it out with a snort.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fair disgusted wi\u2019 ye, Ian, and that\u2019s the truth.\u201d He jerked his head toward the doorway. \u201cGo outside. I\u2019ll see ye by the gate, presently.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense silence in the sitting room, as the sound of the miscreant\u2019s dragging footsteps disappeared down the passage. I kept my own eyes carefully on my hands, folded in my lap. Beside me, Jamie drew a slow, deep breath and sat up straighter, steeling himself.</p><p>\u201cIan.\u201d Jamie spoke mildly to his brother-in-law. \u201cI wish ye wouldna do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ian\u2019s brow was still furrowed with anger as he turned toward Jamie. \u201cThrash the lad? And what have you to say about it, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s jaw tensed, but his voice stayed calm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve nothing to say about it, Ian\u2014he\u2019s your son; you\u2019ll do as ye like. But maybe you\u2019ll let me speak for the way he\u2019s acted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow he\u2019s acted?\u201d Jenny cried, starting suddenly to life. She might leave dealing with her son to Ian, but when it came to her brother, no one was likely to speak for her. \u201cSneakin\u2019 away in the night like a thief, ye mean? Or perhaps ye\u2019ll mean consorting wi\u2019 criminals, and risking his neck for a cask of brandy!\u201d</p><p>Ian silenced her with a quick gesture. He hesitated, still frowning, but then nodded abruptly at Jamie, giving permission.</p><p>\u201cConsorting wi\u2019 criminals like me?\u201d Jamie asked his sister, a definite edge to his voice. His eyes met hers straight on, matching slits of blue.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken where the money comes from, Jenny, that keeps you and your bairns and everyone here in food, and the roof from fallin\u2019 in over your head? It\u2019s not from me printing up copies o\u2019 the Psalms in Edinburgh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did I think it was?\u201d she flared at him. \u201cDid I ask ye what ye did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ye didn\u2019t,\u201d he flashed back. \u201cI think ye\u2019d rather not know\u2014but ye do know, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will ye blame me for what ye do? It\u2019s my fault that I\u2019ve children, and that they must eat?\u201d She didn\u2019t flush red like Jamie did; when Jenny lost her temper, she went dead white with fury.</p><p>I could see him struggling to keep his own temper. \u201cBlame ye? No, of course I dinna blame ye\u2014but is it right for you to blame me, that Ian and I canna keep ye all just working the land?\u201d</p><p>Jenny too was making an effort to subdue her rising temper. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYe do what ye must, Jamie. Ye ken verra well I didna mean you when I said \u2018criminals,\u2019 but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ye mean the men who work for me? I do the same things, Jenny. If they\u2019re criminals, what am I, then?\u201d He glared at her, eyes hot with resentment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my brother,\u201d she said shortly, \u201clittle pleased as I am to say so, sometimes. Damn your eyes, Jamie Fraser! Ye ken quite well I dinna mean to quarrel wi\u2019 whatever ye see fit to do! If ye robbed folk on the highway, or kept a whorehouse in Edinburgh, \u2019twould be because there was no help for it. That doesna mean I want ye takin\u2019 my son to be part of it!\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes tightened slightly at the corners at the mention of whorehouses in Edinburgh, and he darted a quick glance of accusation at Ian, who shook his head. He looked mildly stunned at his wife\u2019s ferocity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said not a word,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cYe ken how she is.\u201d</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath and turned back to Jenny, obviously determined to be reasonable.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see that. But ye canna think I would take Young Ian into danger\u2014God, Jenny, I care for him as though he were my own son!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye?\u201d Her skepticism was pronounced. \u201cSo that\u2019s why ye encouraged him to run off from his home, and kept him with ye, wi\u2019 no word to ease our minds about where he was?\u201d</p><p>Jamie had the grace to look abashed at this.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI meant to\u2014\u201d He broke off with an impatient gesture. \u201cWell, it doesna matter what I meant; I should have sent word, and I didna. But as for encouraging him to run off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna suppose ye did,\u201d Ian interrupted. \u201cNot directly, anyway.\u201d The anger had faded from his long face. He looked tired now, and a little sad. The bones in his face were more pronounced, leaving him hollow-cheeked in the waning afternoon light.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only that the lad loves ye, Jamie,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI see him listen when ye visit, and talk of what ye do; I can see his face. He thinks it\u2019s all excitement and adventure, how ye live, and a good long way from shoveling goat-shit for his mother\u2019s garden.\u201d He smiled briefly, despite himself.</p><p>Jamie gave his brother-in-law a quick smile in return, and a lifted shoulder. \u201cWell, but it\u2019s usual for a lad of that age to want a bit of adventure, no? You and I were the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether he wants it or no, he shouldna be having the sort of adventures he\u2019ll get with you,\u201d Jenny interrupted sharply. She shook her head, the line between her brows growing deeper as she looked disapprovingly at her brother. \u201cThe good Lord kens as there\u2019s a charm on your life, Jamie, or ye\u2019d ha\u2019 been dead a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I suppose He had something in mind to preserve me for.\u201d Jamie glanced at me with a brief smile, and his hand sought mine. Jenny darted a glance at me, too, her face unreadable, then returned to the subject at hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s as may be,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I canna say as the same\u2019s true for Young Ian.\u201d Her expression softened slightly as she looked at Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna ken everything about the way ye live, Jamie\u2014but I ken you well enough to say it\u2019s likely not the way a wee laddie should live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jamie rubbed a hand over his stubbled jaw, and tried again. \u201cAye, well, that\u2019s what I mean about Young Ian. He\u2019s carried himself like a man this last week. I dinna think it right for ye to thrash him like a wee laddie, Ian.\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s eyebrows rose, graceful wings of scorn.</p><p>\u201cA man, now, is he? Why, he\u2019s but a baby, Jamie\u2014he\u2019s not but fourteen!\u201d</p><p>Despite his annoyance, one side of Jamie\u2019s mouth curled slightly.</p><p>\u201cI was a man at fourteen, Jenny,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>She snorted, but a film of moisture shone suddenly over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYe thought ye were.\u201d She stood and turned away abruptly, blinking. \u201cAye, I mind ye then,\u201d she said, face turned to the bookshelf. She reached out a hand as though to support herself, grasping the edge.</p><p>\u201cYe were a bonny lad, Jamie, riding off wi\u2019 Dougal to your first raid, and your dirk all bright on your thigh. I was sixteen, and I thought I\u2019d never seen a sight so fair as you on your pony, so straight and tall. And I mind ye coming back, too, all covered in mud, and a scratch down the side of your face from falling in brambles, and Dougal boasting to Da how brawly ye\u2019d done\u2014driven off six kine by yourself, and had a dunt on the head from the flat of a broadsword, and not made a squeak about it.\u201d Her face once more under control, she turned back from her contemplation of the books to face her brother. \u201cThat\u2019s what a man is, aye?\u201d</p><p>A hint of humor stole back into Jamie\u2019s face as he met her gaze.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, there\u2019s maybe a bit more to it than that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIs there,\u201d she said, more dryly still. \u201cAnd what will that be? To be able to bed a girl? Or to kill a man?\u201d</p><p>I had always thought Janet Fraser had something of the Sight, particularly where her brother was concerned. Evidently the talent extended to her son, as well. The flush over Jamie\u2019s cheekbones deepened, but his expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>She shook her head slowly, looking steadily at her brother. \u201cNay, Young Ian\u2019s not a man yet\u2014but you are, Jamie; and ye ken the difference verra well.\u201d</p> <p>Ian, who had been watching the fireworks between the two Frasers with the same fascination as I had, now coughed briefly.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cYoung Ian\u2019s been waiting for his whipping for the last quarter-hour. Whether or not it\u2019s suitable to beat him, to make him wait any longer for it is a bit cruel, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave ye really got to do it, Ian?\u201d Jamie made one last effort, turning to appeal to his brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Ian slowly, \u201cas I\u2019ve told the lad he\u2019s going to be thrashed, and he kens verra well he\u2019s earned it, I canna just go back on my word. But as for me doing it\u2014no, I dinna think I will.\u201d A faint gleam of humor showed in the soft brown eyes. He reached into a drawer of the sideboard, drew out a thick leather strap, and thrust it into Jamie\u2019s hand. \u201cYou do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jamie was horror-struck. He made a futile attempt to shove the strap back into Ian\u2019s hand, but his brother-in-law ignored it. \u201cI canna thrash the lad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think ye can,\u201d Ian said calmly, folding his arms. \u201cYe\u2019ve said often enough ye care for him as though he were your son.\u201d He tilted his head to one side, and while his expression stayed mild, the brown eyes were implacable. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell ye, Jamie\u2014it\u2019s no that easy to be his Da; best ye go and find that out now, aye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared at Ian for a long moment, then looked to his sister. She raised one eyebrow, staring him down.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it as much as he does, Jamie. Get ye gone.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s lips pressed tight together and his nostrils flared white. Then he whirled on his heel and was gone without speaking. Rapid steps sounded on the boards, and a muffled slam came from the far end of the passage.</p><p>Jenny cast a quick glance at Ian, a quicker one at me, and then turned to the window. Ian and I, both a good deal taller, came to stand behind her. The light outside was failing rapidly, but there was still enough to see the wilting figure of Young Ian, leaning dispiritedly against a wooden gate, some twenty yards from the house.</p><p>Looking around in trepidation at the sound of footsteps, he saw his uncle approaching and straightened up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie!\u201d His eye fell on the strap then, and he straightened a bit more. \u201cAre...are you goin\u2019 to whip me?\u201d</p><p>It was a still evening, and I could hear the sharp hiss of air through Jamie\u2019s teeth.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said frankly. \u201cBut first I must apologize to ye, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me?\u201d Young Ian sounded mildly dazed. Clearly he wasn\u2019t used to having his elders think they owed him an apology, especially before beating him. \u201cYe dinna need to do that, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>The taller figure leaned against the gate, facing the smaller one, head bent.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do. It was wrong of me, Ian, to let ye stay in Edinburgh, and it was maybe wrong, too, to tell ye stories and make ye think of running away to start with. I took ye to places I shouldna, and might have put ye in danger, and I\u2019ve caused more of a moil wi\u2019 your parents than maybe ye should be in by yourself. I\u2019m sorry for it, Ian, and I\u2019ll ask ye to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The smaller figure rubbed a hand through his hair, plainly at a loss for words. \u201cWell...aye. Of course I do, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank ye, Ian.\u201d</p><p>They stood in silence for a moment, then Young Ian heaved a sigh and straightened his drooping shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019d best do it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect so.\u201d Jamie sounded at least as reluctant as his nephew, and I heard Ian, next to me, snort slightly, whether with indignation or amusement, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Resigned, Young Ian turned and faced the gate without hesitation. Jamie followed more slowly. The light was nearly gone and we could see no more than the outlines of figures at this distance, but we could hear clearly from our position at the window. Jamie was standing behind his nephew, shifting uncertainly, as though unsure what to do next.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Ah, what does your father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually ten, Uncle.\u201d Young Ian had shed his coat, and tugged at his waist now, speaking over his shoulder. \u201cTwelve if it\u2019s pretty bad, and fifteen if it\u2019s really awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas this only bad, would ye say, or pretty bad?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief, unwilling laugh from the boy.</p><p>\u201cIf Father\u2019s makin\u2019 you do it, Uncle Jamie, it\u2019s really awful, but I\u2019ll settle for pretty bad. Ye\u2019d better give me twelve.\u201d</p><p>There was another snort from Ian at my elbow. This time, it was definitely amusement. \u201cHonest lad,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Jamie drew in his breath and pulled his arm back, but was interrupted by Young Ian.</p><p>\u201cWait, Uncle, I\u2019m no quite ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, ye\u2019ve got to do that?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice sounded a bit strangled.</p><p>\u201cAye. Father says only girls are whipped wi\u2019 their skirts down,\u201d Young Ian explained. \u201cMen must take it bare-arsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s damn well right about that one,\u201d Jamie muttered, his quarrel with Jenny obviously still rankling. \u201cReady now?\u201d</p><p>The necessary adjustments made, the larger figure stepped back and swung. There was a loud crack, and Jenny winced in sympathy with her son. Beyond a sudden intake of breath, though, the lad was silent, and stayed so through the rest of the ordeal, though I blanched a bit myself.</p><p>Finally Jamie dropped his arm, and wiped his brow. He held out a hand to Ian, slumped over the fence. \u201cAll right, lad?\u201d Young Ian straightened up, with a little difficulty this time, and pulled up his breeks. \u201cAye, Uncle. Thank ye.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice was a little thick, but calm and steady. He took Jamie\u2019s outstretched hand. To my surprise, though, instead of leading the boy back to the house, Jamie thrust the strap into Ian\u2019s other hand.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he announced, striding over to the gate and bending over. Young Ian was as shocked as those of us in the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d he said, stunned.</p><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s your turn,\u201d his uncle said in a firm voice. \u201cI punished you; now you\u2019ve got to punish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI canna do that, Uncle!\u201d Young Ian was as scandalized as though his uncle had suggested he commit some public indecency.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye can,\u201d said Jamie, straightening up to look his nephew in the eye. \u201cYe heard what I said when I apologized to ye, did ye no?\u201d Ian nodded in a dazed fashion. \u201cWeel, then. I\u2019ve done wrong just as much as you, and I\u2019ve to pay for it, too. I didna like whipping you, and ye\u2019re no goin\u2019 to like whipping me, but we\u2019re both goin\u2019 through wi\u2019 it. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Aye, Uncle,\u201d the boy stammered.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d Jamie tugged down his breeches, tucked up his shirttail, and bent over once more, clutching the top rail. He waited a second, then spoke again, as Ian stood paralyzed, strap dangling from his nerveless hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo on.\u201d His voice was steel; the one he used with the whisky smugglers; not to obey was unthinkable. Ian moved timidly to do as he was ordered. Standing back, he took a halfhearted swing. There was a dull thwacking sound.</p><p>\u201cThat one didna count,\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cLook, man, it was just as hard for me to do it to you. Make a proper job of it, now.\u201d</p><p>The thin figure squared its shoulders with sudden determination and the leather whistled through the air. It landed with a crack like lightning. There was a startled yelp from the figure on the fence, and a suppressed giggle, at least half shock, from Jenny.</p><p>Jamie cleared his throat. \u201cAye, that\u2019ll do. Finish it, then.\u201d</p> <p>We could hear Young Ian counting carefully to himself under his breath between strokes of the leather, but aside from a smothered \u201cChrist!\u201d at number nine, there was no further sound from his uncle.</p><p>With a general sigh of relief from inside the house, Jamie rose off the fence after the last stroke, and tucked his shirt into his breeks. He inclined his head formally to his nephew. \u201cThank ye, Ian.\u201d Dropping the formality, he then rubbed his backside, saying in a tone of rueful admiration, \u201cChrist, man, ye\u2019ve an arm on ye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019ve you, Uncle,\u201d said Ian, matching his uncle\u2019s wry tones. The two figures, barely visible now, stood laughing and rubbing themselves for a moment. Jamie flung an arm about his nephew\u2019s shoulders and turned him toward the house. \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, Ian, I dinna want to have to do that again, aye?\u201d he said, confidentially.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bargain, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, the door opened at the end of the passage, and with a look at each other, Jenny and Ian turned as one to greet the returning prodigals.</p> <p>33</p><p>BURIED TREASURE</p><p>\u201cYou look rather like a baboon,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? And what\u2019s one of those?\u201d In spite of the freezing November air pouring in through the half-open window, Jamie showed no signs of discomfort as he dropped his shirt onto the small pile of clothing.</p><p>He stretched luxuriously, completely naked. His joints made little popping noises as he arched his back and stretched upward, fists resting easily on the smoke-dark beams overhead.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, it feels good not to be on a horse!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMm. To say nothing of having a real bed to sleep in, instead of wet heather.\u201d I rolled over, luxuriating in the warmth of the heavy quilts, and the relaxation of sore muscles into the ineffable softness of the goose-down mattress.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye mean to tell me what\u2019s a baboon, then?\u201d Jamie inquired, \u201cOr are ye just makin\u2019 observations for the pleasure of it?\u201d He turned to pick up a frayed willow twig from the washstand, and began to clean his teeth. I smiled at the sight; if I had had no other impact during my earlier sojourn in the past, I had at least been instrumental in seeing that virtually all of the Frasers and Murrays of Lallybroch retained their teeth, unlike most Highlanders\u2014unlike most Englishmen, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cA baboon,\u201d I said, enjoying the sight of his muscular back flexing as he scrubbed, \u201cis a sort of very large monkey with a red behind.\u201d</p><p>He snorted with laughter and choked on the willow twig. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, removing it from his mouth, \u201cI canna fault your observations, Sassenach.\u201d He grinned at me, showing brilliant white teeth, and tossed the twig aside. \u201cIt\u2019s been thirty years since anyone took a tawse to me,\u201d he added, passing his hands tenderly over the still-glowing surfaces of his rear. \u201cI\u2019d forgot how much it stings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here Young Ian was speculating that your arse was tough as saddle leather,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cWas it worth it, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly, sliding into bed beside me. His body was hard and cold as marble, and I squeaked but didn\u2019t protest as he gathered me firmly against his chest. \u201cChrist, you\u2019re warm,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCome closer, hm?\u201d His legs insinuated themselves between mine, and he cupped my bottom, drawing me in.</p><p>He gave a sigh of pure content, and I relaxed against him, feeling our temperatures start to equalize through the thin cotton of the nightdress Jenny had lent me. The peat fire in the hearth had been lit, but hadn\u2019t been able to do much yet toward dispelling the chill. Body heat was much more effective.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, it was worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have beaten Young Ian half-senseless\u2014his father has, once or twice\u2014and it would ha\u2019 done nothing but make him more determined to run off, once he got the chance. But he\u2019ll walk through hot coals before he risks havin\u2019 to do something like that again.\u201d</p> <p>He spoke with certainty, and I thought he was undoubtedly right. Young Ian, looking bemused, had received absolution from his parents, in the form of a kiss from his mother and a swift hug from his father, and then retired to his bed with a handful of cakes, there no doubt to ponder the curious consequences of disobedience.</p><p>Jamie too had been absolved with kisses, and I suspected that this was more important to him than the effects of his performance on Young Ian.</p><p>\u201cAt least Jenny and Ian aren\u2019t angry with you any longer,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s no really that they were angry so much, I think; it\u2019s only that they dinna ken what to do wi\u2019 the lad,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve raised two sons already, and Young Jamie and Michael are fine lads both; but both of them are more like Ian\u2014soft-spoke, and easy in their manner. Young Ian\u2019s quiet enough, but he\u2019s a great deal more like his mother\u2014and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrasers are stubborn, eh?\u201d I said, smiling. This bit of clan doctrine was one of the first things I had learned when I met Jamie, and nothing in my subsequent experience had suggested that it might be in error.</p><p>He chuckled, soft and deep in his chest.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so. Young Ian may look like a Murray, but he\u2019s a Fraser born, all right. And it\u2019s no use to shout at a stubborn man, or beat him, either; it only makes him more set on having his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bear that in mind,\u201d I said dryly. One hand was stroking my thigh, gradually inching the cotton nightdress upward. Jamie\u2019s internal furnace had resumed its operations, and his bare legs were warm and hard against mine. One knee nudged gently, seeking an entrance between my thighs. I cupped his bu**ocks and squeezed gently.</p><p>\u201cDorcas told me that a number of gentlemen pay very well for the privilege of being smacked at the brothel. She says they find it...arousing.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly, tensing his bu**ocks, then relaxing as I stroked them lightly.</p><p>\u201cDo they, then? I suppose it\u2019s true, if Dorcas says so, but I canna see it, myself. There are a great many more pleasant ways to get a cockstand, if ye ask me. On the other hand,\u201d he added fairly, \u201cperhaps it makes a difference if it\u2019s a bonny wee lassie in her shift on the other end o\u2019 the strap, and not your father\u2014or your nephew, come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it does. Shall I try sometime?\u201d The hollow of his throat lay just by my face, sunburned and delicate, showing the faint white triangle of a scar just above the wide arch of his collarbone. I set my lips on the pulsebeat there, and he shivered, though neither of us was cold any longer.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, a little breathless. His hand fumbled at the neck of my shift, pulling loose the ribbons. He rolled onto his back then, lifting me suddenly above him as though I weighed nothing at all. A flick of his finger brought the loosened chemise down over my shoulders, and my ni**les rose at once as the cold air struck them.</p><p>His eyes were more slanted than usual as he smiled up at me, half-lidded as a drowsing cat, and the warmth of his palms encircled both br**sts.</p><p>\u201cI said I could think of more pleasant ways, aye?\u201d</p><p>The candle had guttered and gone out, the fire on the hearth burned low, and a pale November starlight shone through the misted window. Dim as it was, my eyes were so adapted to the dark that I could pick out all the details of the room; the thick white porcelain jug and basin, its blue band black in the starlight, the small embroidered sampler on the wall, and the rumpled heap of Jamie\u2019s clothes on the stool by the bed.</p><p>Jamie was clearly visible, too; covers thrown back, chest gleaming faintly from exertion. I admired the long slope of his belly, where small whorls of dark auburn hair spiraled up across the pale, fresh skin. I couldn\u2019t keep my fingers from touching him, tracing the lines of the powerfully sprung ribs that shaped his torso.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good,\u201d I said dreamily. \u201cSo good to have a man\u2019s body to touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye like it still, then?\u201d He sounded half-shy, half-pleased, as I fondled him. His own arm came around my shoulder, stroking my hair.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a thing I had consciously missed, but having it now reminded me of the joy of it; that drowsy intimacy in which a man\u2019s body is as accessible to you as your own, the strange shapes and textures of it like a sudden extension of your own limbs.</p><p>I ran my hand down the flat slope of his belly, over the smooth jut of hipbone and the swell of muscled thigh. The remnants of firelight caught the red-gold fuzz on arms and legs, and glowed in the auburn thicket nested between his thighs.</p><p>\u201cGod, you are a wonderful hairy creature,\u201d I said. \u201cEven there.\u201d I slid my hand down the smooth crease of his thigh and he spread his legs obligingly, letting me touch the thick, springy curls in the crease of his bu**ocks.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, no one\u2019s hunted me yet for my pelt,\u201d he said comfortably. His hand cupped my own rear firmly, and a large thumb passed gently over the rounded surface. He propped one arm behind his head, and looked lazily down the length of my body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re even less worth the skinning than I am, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d I moved slightly to accommodate his touch as he extended his explorations, enjoying the warmth of his hand on my naked back.</p><p>\u201cEver seen a smooth branch that\u2019s been in still water a long time?\u201d he asked. A finger passed lightly up my spine, raising a ripple of gooseflesh in its wake. \u201cThere are tiny wee bubbles on it, hundreds and thousands and millions of them, so it looks as though it\u2019s furred all about wi\u2019 a silver frost.\u201d His fingers brushed my ribs, my arms, my back, and the tiny down-hairs rose everywhere in the wake of his touch, tingling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what ye look like, my Sassenach,\u201d he said, almost whispering. \u201cAll smooth and naked, dipped in silver.\u201d</p><p>Then we lay quiet for a time, listening to the drip of rain outside. A cold autumn air drifted through the room, mingling with the fire\u2019s smoky warmth. He rolled onto his side, facing away from me, and drew the quilts up to cover us.</p><p>I curled up behind him, knees fitting neatly behind his own. The firelight shone dully from behind me now, gleaming over the smooth round of his shoulder and dimly illuminating his back. I could see the faint lines of the scars that webbed his shoulders, thin streaks of silver on his flesh. At one time, I had known those scars so intimately, I could have traced them with my fingers, blindfolded. Now there was a thin half-moon curve I didn\u2019t know; a diagonal slash that hadn\u2019t been there before, the remnants of a violent past I hadn\u2019t shared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I touched the half-moon, tracing its length.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s hunted you for your pelt,\u201d I said softly, \u201cbut they\u2019ve hunted you, haven\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>His shoulder moved slightly, not quite a shrug. \u201cNow and then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>He breathed slowly for a moment or two before answering.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>My fingers moved down to the diagonal slash. It had been a deep cut; old and well-healed as the damage was, the line was sharp and clear beneath my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was quiet for a moment; then his hand closed over my own, where it lay across his stomach. \u201cBut I maybe ken why.\u201d</p> <p>The house was very quiet. With most of the children and grandchildren gone, there were only the far-off servants in their quarters behind the kitchen, Ian and Jenny in their room at the far end of the hall, and Young Ian somewhere upstairs\u2014all asleep. We could have been alone at the end of the world; both Edinburgh and the smugglers\u2019 cove seemed very far away.</p><p>\u201cDo ye recall, after the fall of Stirling, not so long before Culloden, when all of a sudden there was gossip from everywhere, about gold being sent from France?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Louis? Yes\u2014but he never sent it.\u201d Jamie\u2019s words summoned up those brief frantic days of Charles Stuart\u2019s reckless rise and precipitous fall, when rumor had been the common currency of conversation. \u201cThere was always gossip\u2014about gold from France, ships from Spain, weapons from Holland\u2014but nothing came of most of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, something came\u2014though not from Louis\u2014but no one kent it, then.\u201d</p><p>He told me then of his meeting with the dying Duncan Kerr, and the wanderer\u2019s whispered words, heard in the inn\u2019s attic under the watchful eye of an English officer.</p><p>\u201cHe was fevered, Duncan, but not crazed wi\u2019 it. He kent he was dying, and he kent me, too. It was his only chance to tell someone he thought he could trust\u2014so he told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhite witches and seals?\u201d I repeated. \u201cI must say, it sounds like gibberish. But you understood it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not all of it,\u201d Jamie admitted. He rolled over to face me, frowning slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve no notion who the white witch might be. At the first, I thought he meant you, Sassenach, and my heart nearly stopped when he said it.\u201d He smiled ruefully, and his hand tightened on mine, clasped between us.</p><p>\u201cI thought all at once that perhaps something had gone wrong\u2014maybe ye\u2019d not been able to go back to Frank and the place ye came from\u2014maybe ye\u2019d somehow ended in France, maybe ye were there right then\u2014all kinds o\u2019 fancies went through my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it had been true,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He gave me a lopsided smile, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAnd me in prison? And Brianna would be what\u2014just ten or so? No, dinna waste your time in regretting, Sassenach. You\u2019re here now, and ye\u2019ll never leave me again.\u201d He kissed me gently on the forehead, then resumed his tale.</p><p>\u201cI didna have any idea where the gold had come from, but I kent his telling me where it was, and why it was there. It was Prince Tearlach\u2019s, sent for him. And the bit about the silkies\u2014\u201d He raised his head a little and nodded toward the window, where the rose brier cast its shadows on the glass.</p><p>\u201cFolk said when my mother ran away from Leoch that she\u2019d gone to live wi\u2019 the silkies; only because the maid that saw my father when he took her said as he looked like a great silkie who\u2019d shed his skin and come to walk on the land like a man. And he did.\u201d Jamie smiled and passed a hand through his own thick hair, remembering. \u201cHe had hair thick as mine, but a black like jet. It would shine in some lights, as though it was wet, and he moved quick and sleekit, like a seal through the water.\u201d He shrugged suddenly, shaking off the recollection of his father.</p> <p>\u201cWell, so. When Duncan Kerr said the name Ellen, I kent it was my mother he meant\u2014as a sign that he knew my name and my family, kent who I was; that he wasna raving, no matter how it sounded. And knowin\u2019 that\u2014\u201d He shrugged again. \u201cThe Englishman had told me where they found Duncan, near the coast. There are hundreds of bittie isles and rocks all down that coast, but only one place where the silkies live, at the ends of the MacKenzie lands, off Coigach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did.\u201d He sighed deeply, his free hand drifting to the hollow of my waist. \u201cI wouldna have done it\u2014left the prison, I mean\u2014had I not still thought it maybe had something to do wi\u2019 you, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Escape had been an enterprise of no great difficulty; prisoners were often taken outside in small gangs, to cut the peats that burned on the prison\u2019s hearths, or to cut and haul stone for the ongoing work of repairing the walls.</p><p>For a man to whom the heather was home, disappearing had been easy. He had risen from his work and turned aside by a hummock of grass, unfastening his breeches as though to relieve himself. The guard had looked politely away, and looking back a moment later, beheld nothing but an empty moor, holding no trace of Jamie Fraser.</p><p>\u201cSee, it was little trouble to slip off, but men seldom did,\u201d he explained. \u201cNone of us were from near Ardsmuir\u2014and had we been, there was little left for most o\u2019 the men to gang to.\u201d</p><p>The Duke of Cumberland\u2019s men had done their work well. As one contemporary had put it, evaluating the Duke\u2019s achievement later, \u201cHe created a desert and called it peace.\u201d This modern approach to diplomacy had left some parts of the Highlands all but deserted; the men killed, imprisoned, or transported, crops and houses burned, the women and children turned out to starve or seek refuge elsewhere as best they might. No, a prisoner escaping from Ardsmuir would have been truly alone, without kin or clan to turn to for succor.</p><p>Jamie had known there would be little time before the English commander realized where he must be heading and organized a party of pursuit. On the other hand, there were no real roads in this remote part of the kingdom, and a man who knew the country was at a greater advantage on foot than were the pursuing outlanders on horseback.</p><p>He had made his escape in midafternoon. Taking his bearings by the stars, he had walked through the night, arriving at the coast near dawn the next day.</p><p>\u201cSee, I kent the silkies\u2019 place; it\u2019s well known amongst the MacKenzies, and I\u2019d been there once before, wi\u2019 Dougal.\u201d</p><p>The tide had been high, and the seals mostly out in the water, hunting crabs and fish among the fronds of floating kelp, but the dark streaks of their droppings and the indolent forms of a few idlers marked the seals\u2019 three islands, ranged in a line just inside the lip of a small bay, guarded by a clifflike headland.</p><p>By Jamie\u2019s interpretation of Duncan\u2019s instructions, the treasure lay on the third island, the farthest away from the shore. It was nearly a mile out, a long swim even for a strong man, and his own strength was sapped from the hard prison labor and the long walk without food. He had stood on the clifftop, wondering whether this was a wild-goose chase, and whether the treasure\u2014if there was one\u2014was worth the risk of his life.</p><p>\u201cThe rock was all split and broken there; when I came too close to the edge, chunks would fall awa\u2019 from my feet and plummet down the cliff. I didna see how I\u2019d ever reach the water, let alone the seals\u2019 isle. But then I was minded what Duncan said about Ellen\u2019s tower,\u201d Jamie said. His eyes were open, fixed not on me, but on that distant shore where the crash of falling rock was lost in the smashing of the waves.</p><p>The \u201ctower\u201d was there; a small spike of granite that stuck up no more than five feet from the tip of the headland. But below that spike, hidden by the rocks, was a narrow crack, a small chimney that ran from top to bottom of the eighty-foot cliff, providing a possible passage, if not an easy one, for a determined man.</p><p>From the base of Ellen\u2019s tower to the third island was still over a quarter-mile of heaving green water. Undressing, he had crossed himself, and commending his soul to the keeping of his mother, he had dived naked into the waves.</p><p>He made his way slowly out from the cliff, floundering and choking as the waves broke over his head. No place in Scotland is that far from the sea, but Jamie had been raised inland, his experience of swimming limited to the placid depths of lochs and the pools of trout streams.</p><p>Blinded by salt and deafened by the roaring surf, he had fought the waves for what seemed hours, then thrust his head and shoulders free, gasping for breath, only to see the headland looming\u2014not behind, as he had thought, but to his right.</p><p>\u201cThe tide was goin\u2019 out, and I was goin\u2019 with it,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cI thought, well, that\u2019s it, then, I\u2019m gone, for I knew I could never make my way back. I hadna eaten anything in two days, and hadn\u2019t much strength left.\u201d</p><p>He ceased swimming then, and simply spread himself on his back, giving himself to the embrace of the sea. Light-headed from hunger and effort, he had closed his eyes against the light and searched his mind for the words of the old Celtic prayer against drowning.</p><p>He paused for a moment then, and was quiet for so long that I wondered whether something was wrong. But at last he drew breath and said shyly, \u201cI expect ye\u2019ll think I\u2019m daft, Sassenach. I havena told anyone about it\u2014not even Jenny. But\u2014I heard my mother call me, then, right in the middle of praying.\u201d He shrugged, uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cIt was maybe only that I\u2019d been thinking of her when I left the shore,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet\u2014\u201d He fell silent, until I touched his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d I asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cShe said, \u2018Come here to me, Jamie\u2014come to me, laddie!\u2019\u201d He drew a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cI could hear her plain as day, but I couldna see anything; there was no one there, not even a silkie. I thought perhaps she was callin\u2019 me from Heaven\u2014and I was so tired I really would not ha\u2019 minded dying then, but I rolled myself over and struck out toward where I\u2019d heard her voice. I thought I would swim ten strokes and then stop again to rest\u2014or to sink.\u201d</p><p>But on the eighth stroke, the current had taken him.</p><p>\u201cIt was just as though someone had picked me up,\u201d he said, sounding still surprised at the memory of it. \u201cI could feel it under me and all around; the water was a bit warmer than it had been, and it carried me with it. I didna have to do anything but paddle a bit, to keep my head above water.\u201d</p><p>A strong, curling current, eddying between headland and islands, it had taken him to the edge of the third islet, where no more than a few strokes brought him within reach of its rocks.</p><p>It was a small lump of granite, fissured and creviced like all the ancient rocks of Scotland, and slimed with seaweed and seal droppings to boot, but he crawled on shore with all the thankfulness of a shipwrecked sailor for a land of palm trees and white-sand beaches. He fell down upon his face on the rocky shelf and lay there, grateful for breath, half-dozing with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cThen I felt something looming over me, and there was a terrible stink o\u2019 dead fish,\u201d he said. \u201cI got up onto my knees at once, and there he was\u2014a great bull seal, all sleek and wet, and his black eyes starin\u2019 at me, no more than a yard away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neither fisher nor seaman himself, Jamie had heard enough stories to know that bull seals were dangerous, particularly when threatened by intrusions upon their territory. Looking at the open mouth, with its fine display of sharp, peglike teeth, and the burly rolls of hard fat that girdled the enormous body, he was not disposed to doubt it.</p><p>\u201cHe weighed more than twenty stone, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he wasna inclined to rip the flesh off my bones, still he could ha\u2019 knocked me into the sea wi\u2019 one swipe, or dragged me under to drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously he didn\u2019t, though,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI think I was too mazed from tiredness to do anything sensible,\u201d he said. \u201cI just looked at him for a moment, and then I said, \u2018It\u2019s all right; it\u2019s only me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what did the seal do?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shrugged slightly. \u201cHe looked me over for a bit longer\u2014silkies dinna blink much, did ye know that? It\u2019s verra unnerving to have one look at ye for long\u2014then he gave a sort of a grunt and slid off the rock into the water.\u201d</p><p>Left in sole possession of the tiny islet, Jamie had sat blankly for a time, recovering his strength, and then at last began a methodical search of the crevices. Small as the area was, it took little time to find a deep split in the rock that led down to a wide hollow space, a foot below the rocky surface. Floored with dry sand and located in the center of the island, the hollow would be safe from flooding in all but the worst storms.</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t keep me in suspense,\u201d I said, poking him in the stomach. \u201cWas the French gold there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was and it wasn\u2019t, Sassenach,\u201d he answered, neatly sucking in his stomach. \u201cI\u2019d been expecting gold bullion; that\u2019s what the rumor said that Louis would send. And thirty thousand pounds\u2019 worth of gold bullion would make a good-sized hoard. But all there was in the hollow was a box, less than a foot long, and a small leather pouch. The box did have gold in it, though\u2014and silver, too.\u201d</p> <p>Gold and silver indeed. The wooden box had contained two hundred and five coins, gold ones and silver ones, some as sharply cut as though new-minted, some with their markings worn nearly to blankness.</p><p>\u201cAncient coins, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAncient? What, you mean very old\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreek, Sassenach, and Roman. Verra old indeed.\u201d</p><p>We lay staring at each other in the dim light for a moment, not speaking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s incredible,\u201d I said at last. \u201cIt\u2019s treasure, all right, but not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot what Louis would send, to help feed an army, no,\u201d he finished for me. \u201cNo, whoever put this treasure there, it wasna Louis or any of his ministers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bag?\u201d I said, suddenly remembering. \u201cWhat was in the pouch you found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStones, Sassenach. Gemstones. Diamonds and pearls and emeralds and sapphires. Not many, but nicely cut and big enough.\u201d He smiled, a little grimly. \u201cAye, big enough.\u201d</p><p>He had sat on a rock under the dim gray sky, turning the coins and the jewels over and over between his fingers, stunned into bewilderment. At last, roused by a sensation of being watched, he had looked up to find himself surrounded by a circle of curious seals. The tide was out, the females had come back from their fishing, and twenty pairs of round black eyes surveyed him cautiously.</p><p>The huge black male, emboldened by the presence of his harem, had come back too. He barked loudly, darting his head threateningly from side to side, and advanced on Jamie, sliding his three-hundred-pound bulk a few feet closer with each booming exclamation, propelling himself with his flippers across the slick rock.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d best leave, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d found what I came to find, after all. So I put the box and the pouch back where I\u2019d found them\u2014I couldna carry them ashore, after all, and if I did\u2014what then? So I put them back, and crawled down into the water, half-frozen wi\u2019 cold.\u201d</p><p>A few strokes from the island had taken him again into the current heading landward; it was a circular current, like most eddies, and the gyre had carried him to the foot of the headland within half an hour, where he crawled ashore, dressed, and fell asleep in a nest of marrow grass.</p><p>He paused then, and I could see that while his eyes were open and fixed on me, it wasn\u2019t me they saw.</p> <p>\u201cI woke at dawn,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have seen a great many dawns, Sassenach, but never one like that one.</p><p>\u201cI could feel the earth turn beneath me, and my own breath coming wi\u2019 the breathing of the wind. It was as though I had no skin nor bone, but only the light of the rising sun inside me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened, as he left the moor and came back to me.</p><p>\u201cSo then the sun came up higher,\u201d he said, matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd when it warmed me enough to stand, I got up and went inland toward the road, to meet the English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did you go back?\u201d I demanded. \u201cYou were free! You had money! And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where would I spend such money as that, Sassenach?\u201d he asked. \u201cWalk into a cottar\u2019s hearth and offer him a gold denarius, or a wee emerald?\u201d He smiled at my indignation and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he said gently, \u201cI had to go back. Aye, I could ha\u2019 lived on the moor for a time\u2014half-starved and naked, but I might have managed. But they were hunting me, Sassenach, and hunting hard, for thinking that I might know where the gold was hid. No cot near Ardsmuir would be safe from the English, so long as I was free, and might be thought to seek refuge there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the English hunting, ye ken,\u201d he added, a harder note creeping into his voice. \u201cYe\u2019ll have seen the panel in the entry hall?\u201d</p><p>I had; one panel of the glowing oak that lined the hall below had been smashed in, perhaps by a heavy boot, and the crisscross scars of saber slashes marred the paneling from door to stairs.</p><p>\u201cWe keep it so to remember,\u201d he said. \u201cTo show to the weans, and tell them when they ask\u2014this is what the English are.\u201d</p><p>The suppressed hate in his voice struck me low in the pit of the stomach. Knowing what I knew of what the English army had done in the Highlands, there was bloody little I could say in argument. I said nothing, and he continued after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna expose the folk near Ardsmuir to that kind of attention, Sassenach.\u201d At the word \u201cSassenach,\u201d his hand squeezed mine and a small smile curved the corner of his mouth. Sassenach I might be to him, but not English.</p><p>\u201cFor that matter,\u201d he went on, \u201cwere I not taken, the hunt would likely come here again\u2014to Lallybroch. If I would risk the folk near Ardsmuir, I would not risk my own. And even without that\u2014\u201d He stopped, seeming to struggle to find words.</p><p>\u201cI had to go back,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cFor the sake of the men there, if for nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men in the prison?\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cWere some of the Lallybroch men arrested with you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. The small vertical line that appeared between his brows when he thought hard was visible, even by starlight.</p><p>\u201cNo. There were men there from all over the Highlands\u2014from every clan, almost. Only a few men from each clan\u2014remnants and ragtag. But the more in need of a chief, for all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you were to them?\u201d I spoke gently, restraining the urge to smooth the line away with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cFor lack of any better,\u201d he said, with the flicker of a smile.</p><p>He had come from the bosom of family and tenants, from a strength that had sustained him for seven years, to find a lack of hope and a loneliness that would kill a man faster than the damp and the filth and the quaking ague of the prison.</p><p>And so, quite simply, he had taken the ragtag and remnants, the castoff survivors of the field of Culloden, and made them his own, that they and he might survive the stones of Ardsmuir as well. Reasoning, charming, and cajoling where he could, fighting where he must, he had forced them to band together, to face their captors as one, to put aside ancient clan rivalries and allegiances, and take him as their chieftain.</p><p>\u201cThey were mine,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd the having of them kept me alive.\u201d But then they had been taken from him and from each other\u2014wrenched apart and sent into indenture in a foreign land. And he had not been able to save them.</p><p>\u201cYou did your best for them. But it\u2019s over now,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>We lay in each other\u2019s arms in silence for a long time, letting the small noises of the house wash over us. Different from the comfortable commercial bustle of the brothel, the tiny creaks and sighing spoke of quiet, and home, and safety. For the first time, we were truly alone together, removed from danger and distraction.</p><p>There was time, now. Time to hear the rest of the story of the gold, to hear what he had done with it, to find out what had happened to the men of Ardsmuir, to speculate about the burning of the printshop, Young Ian\u2019s one-eyed seaman, the encounter with His Majesty\u2019s Customs on the shore by Arbroath, to decide what to do next. And since there was time, there was no need to speak of any of that, now.</p><p>The last peat broke and fell apart on the hearth, its glowing interior hissing red in the cold. I snuggled closer to Jamie, burying my face in the side of his neck. He tasted faintly of grass and sweat, with a whiff of brandy.</p><p>He shifted his body in response, bringing us together all down our naked lengths.</p><p>\u201cWhat, again?\u201d I murmured, amused. \u201cMen your age aren\u2019t supposed to do it again so soon.\u201d</p><p>His teeth nibbled gently on my earlobe. \u201cWell, you\u2019re doing it too, Sassenach,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd you\u2019re older than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d I said, gasping a little as he moved suddenly over me, his shoulders blotting out the starlit window. \u201cI\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if ye weren\u2019t a woman, Sassenach,\u201d he assured me, settling to his work, \u201cI wouldna be doing it either. Hush, now.\u201d</p><p>I woke just past dawn to the scratching of the rose brier against the window, and the muffled thump and clang of breakfast fixing in the kitchen below. Peering over Jamie\u2019s sleeping form, I saw that the fire was dead out. I slid out of bed, quietly so as not to wake him. The floorboards were icy under my feet and I reached, shivering, for the first available garment.</p><p>Swathed in the folds of Jamie\u2019s shirt, I knelt on the hearth and went about the laborious business of rekindling the fire, thinking rather wistfully that I might have included a box of safety matches in the short list of items I had thought worthwhile to bring. Striking sparks from a flint to catch kindling does work, but not usually on the first try. Or the second. Or...</p><p>Somewhere around the dozenth attempt, I was rewarded by a tiny black spot on the twist of tow I was using for kindling. It grew at once and blossomed into a tiny flame. I thrust it hastily but carefully beneath the little tent of twigs I had prepared, to shelter the blooming flame from the cold breeze.</p><p>I had left the window ajar the night before, to insure not being suffocated by the smoke\u2014peat fires burned hot, but dully, with a lot of smoke, as the blackened beams overhead attested. Just now, though, I thought we could dispense with fresh air\u2014at least until I got the fire thoroughly under way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pane was rimed at the bottom with a light frost; winter was not far off. The air was so crisp and fresh that I paused before shutting the window, breathing in great gulps of dead leaf, dried apples, cold earth, and damp, sweet grass. The scene outside was perfect in its still clarity, stone walls and dark pines drawn sharp as black quillstrokes against the gray overcast of the morning.</p><p>A movement drew my eye to the top of the hill, where the rough track led to the village of Broch Mordha, ten miles distant. One by one, three small Highland ponies came up over the rise, and started down the hill toward the farmhouse.</p><p>They were too far away for me to make out the faces, but I could see by the billowing skirts that all three riders were women. Perhaps it was the girls\u2014Maggie, Kitty, and Janet\u2014coming back from Young Jamie\u2019s house. My own Jamie would be glad to see them.</p><p>I pulled the shirt, redolent of Jamie, around me against the chill, deciding to take advantage of what privacy might remain to us this morning by thawing out in bed. I shut the window, and paused to lift several of the light peat bricks from the basket by the hearth and feed them carefully to my fledgling fire, before shedding the shirt and crawling under the covers, numb toes tingling with delight at the luxurious warmth.</p> <p>Jamie felt the chill of my return, and rolled instinctively toward me, gathering me neatly in and curling round me spoon-fashion. He sleepily rubbed his face against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSleep well, Sassenach?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNever better,\u201d I assured him, snuggling my cold bottom into the warm hollow of his thighs. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmm.\u201d He responded with a blissful groan, wrapping his arms about me. \u201cDreamed like a fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaked women, mostly,\u201d he said, and set his teeth gently in the flesh of my shoulder. \u201cThat, and food.\u201d His stomach rumbled softly. The scent of biscuits and fried bacon in the air was faint but unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cSo long as you don\u2019t confuse the two,\u201d I said, twitching my shoulder out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cI can tell a hawk from a handsaw, when the wind sets north by nor\u2019west,\u201d he assured me, \u201cand a sweet, plump lassie from a salt-cured ham, too, appearances notwithstanding.\u201d He grabbed my bu**ocks with both hands and squeezed, making me yelp and kick him in the shins.</p><p>\u201cBeast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a beast, is it?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWell, then...\u201d Growling deep in his throat, he dived under the quilt and proceeded to nip and nibble his way up the insides of my thighs, blithely ignoring my squeaks and the hail of kicks on his back and shoulders. Dislodged by our struggles, the quilt slid off onto the floor, revealing the tousled mass of his hair, flying wild over my thighs.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s less difference than I thought,\u201d he said, his head popping up between my legs as he paused for breath. He pressed my thighs flat against the mattress and grinned up at me, spikes of red hair standing on end like a porcupine\u2019s quills. \u201cYe do taste a bit salty, come to try it. What do ye\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He was interrupted by a sudden bang as the door flew open and rebounded from the wall. Startled, we turned to look. In the doorway stood a young girl I had never seen before. She was perhaps fifteen or sixteen, with long flaxen hair and big blue eyes. The eyes were somewhat bigger than normal, and filled with an expression of horrified shock as she stared at me. Her gaze moved slowly from my tangled hair to my bare br**sts, and down the slopes of my naked body, until it encountered Jamie, lying prone between my thighs, white-faced with a shock equal to hers.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d she said, in tones of total outrage. \u201cWho is that woman?\u201d</p><p>34</p><p>DADDY</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>Jamie had turned to stone when the door opened. Now he shot bolt upright, snatching at the fallen quilt. He shoved the disheveled hair out of his face, and glared at the girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of bloody hell are you doing here?\u201d he demanded. Red-bearded, naked, and hoarse with fury, he was a formidable sight, and the girl took a step backward, looking uncertain. Then her chin firmed and she glared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI came with Mother!\u201d</p> <p>The effect on Jamie could not have been greater had she shot him through the heart. He jerked violently, and all the color went out of his face.</p><p>It came flooding back, as the sound of rapid footsteps sounded on the wooden staircase. He leapt out of bed, tossing the quilt hastily in my direction, and grabbed his breeks.</p><p>He had barely pulled them on when another female figure burst into the room, skidded to a halt, and stood staring, bug-eyed, at the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d She whirled toward Jamie, fists clenched against the cloak she still wore. \u201cIt\u2019s true! It\u2019s the Sassenach witch! How could ye do such a thing to me, Jamie Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still, Laoghaire!\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing to ye!\u201d</p><p>I sat up against the wall, clutching the quilt to my bosom and staring. It was only when he spoke her name that I recognized her. Twenty-odd years ago, Laoghaire MacKenzie had been a slender sixteen-year-old, with rose-petal skin, moonbeam hair, and a violent\u2014and unrequited\u2014passion for Jamie Fraser. Evidently, a few things had changed.</p><p>She was nearing forty and no longer slender, having thickened considerably. The skin was still fair, but weathered, and stretched plumply over cheeks flushed with anger. Strands of ashy hair straggled out from under her respectable white kertch. The pale blue eyes were the same, though\u2014they turned on me again, with the same expression of hatred I had seen in them long ago.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine!\u201d she hissed. She stamped her foot. \u201cGet ye back to the hell that ye came from, and leave him to me! Go, I say!\u201d</p><p>As I made no move to obey, she glanced wildly about in search of a weapon. Catching sight of the blue-banded ewer, she seized it and drew back her arm to fling it at me. Jamie plucked it neatly from her hand, set it back on the bureau, and grasped her by the upper arm, hard enough to make her squeal.</p><p>He turned her and shoved her roughly toward the door. \u201cGet ye downstairs,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll speak wi\u2019 ye presently, Laoghaire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll speak wi\u2019 me? Speak wi\u2019 me, is it!\u201d she cried. Face contorted, she swung her free hand at him, raking his face from eye to chin with her nails.</p><p>He grunted, grabbed her other wrist, and dragging her to the door, pushed her out into the passage and slammed the door to and turned the key.</p><p>By the time he turned around again, I was sitting on the edge of the bed, fumbling with shaking hands as I tried to pull my stockings on.</p><p>\u201cI can explain it to ye, Claire,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI d-don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. My lips were numb, along with the rest of me, and it was hard to form words. I kept my eyes fixed on my feet as I tried\u2014and failed\u2014to tie my garters.</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d he said violently, bringing his fist down on the table with a crash that made me jump. I jerked my head up, and caught a glimpse of him towering over me. With his red hair tumbled loose about his shoulders, his face unshaven, bare-chested, and the raw marks of Laoghaire\u2019s nails down his cheek, he looked like a Viking raider, bent on mayhem. I turned away to look for my shift.</p><p>It was lost in the bedclothes; I scrabbled about among the sheets. A considerable pounding had started up on the other side of the door, accompanied by shouts and shrieks, as the commotion attracted the other inhabitants of the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go and explain things to your daughter,\u201d I said, pulling the crumpled cotton over my head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my daughter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d My head popped out of the neck of the shift, and I lifted my chin to stare up at him. \u201cAnd I suppose you aren\u2019t married to Laoghaire, either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married to you, damn it!\u201d he bellowed, striking his fist on the table again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I felt very cold. My stiff fingers couldn\u2019t manage the lacing of the stays; I threw them aside, and stood up to look for my gown, which was somewhere on the other side of the room\u2014behind Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI need my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no going anywhere, Sassenach. Not until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d I shrieked it, surprising both of us. He stared at me for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said quietly. He glanced at the door, now reverberating under the force of the pounding. He drew a deep breath and straightened, squaring his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and settle things. Then we\u2019ll talk, the two of us. Stay here, Sass\u2014Claire.\u201d He picked up his shirt and yanked it over his head. Unlocking the door, he stepped out into the suddenly silent corridor and closed it behind him.</p><p>I managed to pick up the dress, then collapsed on the bed and sat shaking all over, the green wool crumpled across my knees.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think in a straight line. My mind spun in small circles around the central fact; he was married. Married to Laoghaire! And he had a family. And yet he had wept for Brianna.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bree!\u201d I said aloud. \u201cOh, God, Bree!\u201d and began to cry\u2014partly from shock, partly at the thought of Brianna. It wasn\u2019t logical, but this discovery seemed a betrayal of her, as much as of me\u2014or of Laoghaire.</p><p>The thought of Laoghaire turned shock and sorrow to rage in a moment. I rubbed a fold of green wool savagely across my face, leaving the skin red and prickly.</p><p>Damn him! How dare he? If he had married again, thinking me dead, that was one thing. I had half-expected, half-feared it. But to marry that woman\u2014that spiteful, sneaking little bitch who had tried to murder me at Castle Leoch...but he likely didn\u2019t know that, a small voice of reason in my head pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWell, he should have known!\u201d I said. \u201cDamn him to hell, how could he take her, anyway?\u201d The tears were rolling heedlessly down my face, hot spurts of loss and fury, and my nose was running. I groped for a handkerchief, found none, and in desperation, blew my nose at last on a corner of the sheet.</p><p>It smelled of Jamie. Worse, it smelled of the two of us, and the faint, musky lingerings of our pleasure. There was a small tingling spot on the inside of my thigh, where Jamie had nipped me, a few minutes before. I brought the flat of my hand down hard on the spot in a vicious slap, to kill the feeling.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d I screamed. I grabbed the pitcher Laoghaire had tried to throw at me, and hurled it myself. It crashed against the door in an explosion of splinters.</p><p>I stood in the middle of the room, listening. It was quiet. There was no sound from below; no one was coming to see what had made the crash. I imagined they were all much too concerned with soothing Laoghaire to worry about me.</p><p>Did they live here, at Lallybroch? I recalled Jamie, taking Fergus aside, sending him ahead, ostensibly to tell Ian and Jenny we were coming. And, presumably, to warn them about me, and get Laoghaire out of the way before I arrived.</p><p>What in the name of God did Jenny and Ian think about this? Clearly they must know about Laoghaire\u2014and yet they had received me last night, with no sign of it on their faces. But if Laoghaire had been sent away\u2014why did she come back? Even trying to think about it made my temples throb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The act of violence had drained enough rage for me to be able once more to control my shaking fingers. I kicked the stays into a corner and pulled the green gown over my head.</p><p>I had to get out of there. That was the only half-coherent thought in my head, and I clung to it. I had to leave. I couldn\u2019t stay, not with Laoghaire and her daughters in the house. They belonged there\u2014I didn\u2019t.</p><p>I managed to tie up the garters this time, do up the laces of the dress, fasten the multiple hooks of the overskirt, and find my shoes. One was under the washstand, the other by the massive oak armoire, where I had kicked them the night before, dropping my clothes carelessly anywhere in my eagerness to crawl into the welcoming bed and nestle warmly in Jamie\u2019s arms.</p><p>I shivered. The fire had gone out again, and there was an icy draft from the window. I felt chilled to the bone, despite my clothes.</p> <p>I wasted some time in searching for my cloak before realizing that it was downstairs; I had left it in the parlor the day before. I pushed my fingers through my hair, but was too upset to look for a comb. The strands crackled with electricity from having the woolen dress pulled over my head, and I slapped irritably at the floating hairs that stuck to my face.</p><p>Ready. Ready as I\u2019d be, at least. I paused for one last look around, then heard footsteps coming up the stair.</p><p>Not fast and light, like the last ones. These were heavier, and slow, deliberate. I knew without seeing him that it was Jamie coming\u2014and that he wasn\u2019t anxious to see me.</p><p>Fine. I didn\u2019t want to see him, either. Better just to leave at once, without speaking. What was there to say?</p><p>I backed away as the door opened, unaware that I was moving, until my legs hit the edge of the bed. I lost my balance and sat down. Jamie paused in the doorway, looking down at me.</p> <p>He had shaved. That was the first thing I noticed. In echo of Young Ian the day before, he had hastily shaved, brushed his hair back and tidied himself before facing trouble. He seemed to know what I was thinking; the ghost of a smile passed over his face, as he rubbed his freshly scraped chin.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think it will help?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I swallowed, and licked dry lips, but didn\u2019t answer. He sighed, and answered himself.</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d He stepped into the room and closed the door. He stood awkwardly for a moment, then moved toward the bed, one hand extended toward me. \u201cClaire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d I leapt to my feet and backed away, circling toward the door. His hand fell to his side, but he stepped in front of me, blocking the way.</p><p>\u201cWill ye no let me explain, Claire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to be a little late for that,\u201d I said, in what I meant to be a cold, disdainful tone. Unfortunately, my voice shook.</p><p>He pushed the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cYe never used to be unreasonable,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me what I used to be!\u201d The tears were much too near the surface, and I bit my lip to hold them back.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d His face was very pale; the scratches Laoghaire had given him showed as three red lines, livid down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI dinna live with her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe and the girls live at Balriggan, over near Broch Mordha.\u201d He watched me closely, but I said nothing. He shrugged a little, settling the shirt on his shoulders, and went on.</p><p>\u201cIt was a great mistake\u2014the marriage between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith two children? Took you a while to realize, didn\u2019t it?\u201d I burst out. His lips pressed tight together.</p> <p>\u201cThe lassies aren\u2019t mine; Laoghaire was a widow wi\u2019 the two bairns when I wed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any real difference, but still, I felt a small wave of something like relief, on Brianna\u2019s behalf. She was the sole child of Jamie\u2019s heart, at least, even if I\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not lived wi\u2019 them for some time; I live in Edinburgh, and send money to them, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference. Let me by, please\u2014I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>The thick, ruddy brows drew sharply together.</p><p>\u201cGoing where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack. Away. I don\u2019t know\u2014let me by!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d he said definitely.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop me!\u201d</p><p>He reached out and grabbed me by both arms.</p><p>\u201cAye, I can,\u201d he said. He could; I jerked furiously, but couldn\u2019t budge the iron grip on my biceps.</p><p>\u201cLet go of me this minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t!\u201d He glared at me, eyes narrowed, and I suddenly realized that calm as he might seem outwardly, he was very nearly as upset as I was. I saw the muscles of his throat move as he swallowed, controlling himself enough to speak again.</p><p>\u201cI willna let ye go until I\u2019ve explained to ye, why...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is there to explain?\u201d I demanded furiously. \u201cYou married again! What else is there?\u201d</p><p>The color was rising in his face; the tips of his ears were already red, a sure sign of impending fury.</p><p>\u201cAnd have you lived a nun for twenty years?\u201d he demanded, shaking me slightly. \u201cHave ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I flung the word at his face, and he flinched slightly. \u201cNo, I bloody haven\u2019t! And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been a monk, either\u2014I never did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d he began, but I was much too furious to listen anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me, damn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did!\u201d The skin was stretched tight over his cheekbones, as it was when he was very angry indeed.</p><p>\u201cYou did, you bastard! You know you did! Let go!\u201d I kicked him sharply in the shin, hard enough to numb my toes. He exclaimed in pain, but didn\u2019t let go. Instead, he squeezed harder, making me yelp.</p><p>\u201cI never said a thing to ye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t! But you lied, anyway! You let me think you weren\u2019t married, that there wasn\u2019t anyone, that you\u2014that you\u2014\u201d I was half-sobbing with rage, gasping between words. \u201cYou should have told me, the minute I came! Why in hell didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d His grip on my arms slackened, and I managed to wrench myself free. He took a step toward me, eyes glittering with fury. I wasn\u2019t afraid of him; I drew back my fist and hit him in the chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I shrieked, hitting him again and again and again, the sound of the blows thudding against his chest. \u201cWhy, why, why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was afraid!\u201d He got hold of my wrists and threw me backward, so I fell across the bed. He stood over me, fists clenched, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cI am a coward, damn you! I couldna tell ye, for fear ye would leave me, and unmanly thing that I am, I thought I couldna bear that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnmanly? With two wives? Ha!\u201d</p><p>I really thought he would slap me; he raised his arm, but then his open palm clenched into a fist.</p><p>\u201cAm I a man? To want you so badly that nothing else matters? To see you, and know I would sacrifice honor or family or life itself to lie wi\u2019 you, even though ye\u2019d left me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the filthy, unmitigated, bleeding gall to say such a thing to me?\u201d My voice was so high, it came out as a thin and vicious whisper. \u201cYou\u2019ll blame me?\u201d</p><p>He stopped then, chest heaving as he caught his breath.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I canna blame you.\u201d He turned aside, blindly. \u201cHow could it have been your fault? Ye wanted to stay wi\u2019 me, to die with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, the more fool I,\u201d I said. \u201cYou sent me back, you made me go! And now you want to blame me for going?\u201d</p><p>He turned back to me, eyes dark with desperation.</p><p>\u201cI had to send ye away! I had to, for the bairn\u2019s sake!\u201d His eyes went involuntarily to the hook where his coat hung, the pictures of Brianna in its pocket. He took one deep, quivering breath, and calmed himself with a visible effort.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, much more quietly. \u201cI canna regret that, whatever the cost. I would have given my life, for her and for you. If it took my heart and soul, too...\u201d</p><p>He drew a long, quivering breath, mastering the passion that shook him.</p><p>\u201cI canna blame ye for going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blame me for coming back, though.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as though to clear it.</p><p>\u201cNo, God no!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hands tight between his own, the strength of his grip grinding the bones together.</p><p>\u201cDo ye know what it is to live twenty years without a heart? To live half a man, and accustom yourself to living in the bit that\u2019s left, filling in the cracks wi\u2019 what mortar comes handy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know?\u201d I echoed. I struggled to loose myself, to little effect. \u201cYes, you bloody bastard, I know that! What did you think, I\u2019d gone straight back to Frank and lived happy ever after?\u201d I kicked at him as hard as I could. He flinched, but didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I hoped ye did,\u201d he said, speaking through clenched teeth. \u201cAnd then sometimes I could see it\u2014him with you, day and night, lyin\u2019 with ye, taking your body, holding my child! And God, I could kill ye for it!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he dropped my hands, whirled, and smashed his fist through the side of the oak armoire. It was an impressive blow; the armoire was a sturdy piece of furniture. It must have bruised his knuckles considerably, but without hesitation, he drove the other fist into the oak boards as well, as though the shining wood were Frank\u2019s face\u2014or mine.</p><p>\u201cFeel like that about it, do you?\u201d I said coldly, as he stepped back, panting. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to imagine you with Laoghaire\u2014I\u2019ve bloody seen her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna care a fig for Laoghaire, and never have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d I said again. \u201cYou\u2019d marry a woman without wanting her, and then throw her aside the minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he roared. \u201cHold your tongue, ye wicked wee bitch!\u201d He slammed a fist down on the washstand, glaring at me. \u201cI\u2019m damned the one way or the other, no? If I felt anything for her, I\u2019m a faithless womanizer, and if I didn\u2019t, I\u2019m a heartless beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I had?\u201d He grabbed my hand and jerked me to my feet, holding me eye to eye with him. \u201cYou\u2019d have turned on your heel and gone without a word. And having seen ye again\u2014I tell ye, I would ha\u2019 done far worse than lie to keep you!\u201d</p><p>He pressed me tight against his body and kissed me, long and hard. My knees turned to water, and I fought to keep my feet, buttressed by the vision of Laoghaire\u2019s angry eyes, and her voice, echoing shrill in my ears. He\u2019s mine!</p><p>\u201cThis is senseless,\u201d I said, pulling away. Fury had its own intoxication, but the hangover was setting in fast, a black dizzy vortex. My head swam so that I could hardly keep my balance. \u201cI can\u2019t think straight. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>I lurched toward the door, but he caught me by the waist, yanking me back.</p><p>He whirled me toward himself and kissed me again, hard enough to leave a quicksilver taste of blood in my mouth. It was neither affection nor desire, but a blind passion, a determination to possess me. He was through talking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So was I. I pulled my mouth away and slapped him hard across the face, fingers curved to rake his flesh.</p><p>He jerked back, cheek scraped raw, then twisted his fingers tight in my hair, bent and took my mouth again, deliberate and savage, ignoring the kicks and blows I rained on him.</p><p>He bit my lower lip, hard, and when I opened my lips, gasping, thrust his tongue into my mouth, stealing breath and words together.</p><p>He threw me bodily onto the bed where we had lain laughing an hour before, and pinned me there at once with the weight of his body.</p> <p>He was most mightily roused.</p><p>So was I.</p><p>Mine, he said, without uttering a word. Mine!</p><p>I fought him with boundless fury and no little skill, and Yours, my body echoed back. Yours, and may you be damned for it!</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel him rip my gown, but I felt the heat of his body on my bare br**sts, through the thin linen of his shirt, the long, hard muscle of his thigh straining against my own. He took his hand off my arm to tear at his breeches, and I clawed him from ear to breast, striping his skin with pale red.</p> <p>We were doing our level best to kill each other, fueled by the rage of years apart\u2014mine for his sending me away, his for my going, mine for Laoghaire, his for Frank.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d he panted. \u201cWhore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d I got a hand in his own long hair, and yanked, pulling his face down to me again. We rolled off the bed and landed on the floor in a tangled heap, rolling to and fro in a welter of half-uttered curses and broken words.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hear the door open. I didn\u2019t hear anything, though she must have called out, more than once. Blind and deaf, I knew nothing but Jamie until the shower of cold water struck us, sudden as an electric shock. Jamie froze. All the color left his face, leaving the bones jutting stark beneath the skin.</p><p>I lay dazed, drops of water dripping from the ends of his hair onto my br**sts. Just behind him, I could see Jenny, her face as white as his, holding an empty pan in her hands.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d she said. Her eyes were slanted with a horrified anger. \u201cHow could ye, Jamie? Rutting like a wild beast, and not carin\u2019 if all the house hears ye!\u201d</p> <p>He moved off me, slowly, clumsy as a bear. Jenny snatched a quilt from the bed and flung it over my body.</p><p>On all fours, he shook his head like a dog, sending droplets of water flying. Then, very slowly, he got to his feet, and pulled his ripped breeches back into place.</p><p>\u201cAre ye no ashamed?\u201d she cried, scandalized.</p><p>Jamie stood looking down at her as though he had never seen any creature quite like her, and was making up his mind what she might be. The wet ends of his hair dripped over his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said at last, quite mildly. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He seemed dazed. He closed his eyes and a brief, deep shudder went over him. Without a word, he turned and went out.</p><p>35</p><p>FLIGHT FROM EDEN</p> <p>Jenny helped me to the bed, making small clucking noises; whether of shock or concern, I couldn\u2019t tell. I was vaguely conscious of hovering figures in the doorway\u2014servants, I supposed\u2014but wasn\u2019t disposed to pay much attention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find ye something to put on,\u201d she murmured, fluffing a pillow and pushing me back onto it. \u201cAnd perhaps a bit of a drink. You\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jamie?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me quickly, sympathy mixed with a gleam of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cDinna be afraid; I\u2019ll no let him at ye again.\u201d She spoke firmly, then pressed her lips tight together, frowning as she tucked the quilt around me. \u201cHow he could do such a thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault\u2014not this.\u201d I ran a hand through my tangled hair, indicating my general dishevelment. \u201cI mean\u2014I did it, as much as he did. It was both of us. He\u2014I\u2014\u201d I let my hand fall, helpless to explain. I was bruised and shaken, and my lips were swollen.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d was all Jenny said, but she gave me a long, assessing look, and I thought it quite possible that she did see.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to talk about the recent happenings, and she seemed to sense this, for she kept quiet for a bit, giving a soft-voiced order to someone in the hall, then moving about the room, straightening furniture and tidying things. I saw her pause for a moment as she saw the holes in the armoire, then she stooped to pick up the larger pieces of the shattered ewer.</p><p>As she dumped them into the basin, there was a faint thud from the house below; the slam of the big main door. She stepped to the window and pushed the curtain aside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jamie,\u201d she said. She glanced at me, and let the curtain fall. \u201cHe\u2019ll be going up to the hill; he goes there, if he\u2019s troubled. That, or he gets drunk wi\u2019 Ian. The hill\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>I gave a small snort.</p><p>\u201cYes, I expect he\u2019s troubled, all right.\u201d</p><p>There was a light step in the hallway, and the younger Janet appeared, carefully balancing a tray of biscuits, whisky, and water. She looked pale and scared.</p><p>\u201cAre ye...well, Aunt?\u201d she asked tentatively, setting down the tray.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assured her, pushing myself upright and reaching for the whisky decanter.</p><p>A sharp glance having assured Jenny of the same, she patted her daughter\u2019s arm and turned toward the door.</p><p>\u201cStay wi\u2019 your auntie,\u201d she ordered. \u201cI\u2019ll go and find a dress.\u201d Janet nodded obediently, and sat down by the bed on a stool, watching me as I ate and drank.</p><p>I began to feel physically much stronger with a little food inside me. Internally, I felt quite numb; the recent events seemed at once dreamlike and yet completely clear in my mind. I could recall the smallest details; the blue calico bows on the dress of Laoghaire\u2019s daughter, the tiny broken veins in Laoghaire\u2019s cheeks, a rough-torn fingernail on Jamie\u2019s fourth finger.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Laoghaire is?\u201d I asked Janet. The girl had her head down, apparently studying her own hands. At my question, she jerked upright, blinking.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she said. \u201cOh. Aye, she and Marsali and Joan went back to Balriggan, where they live. Uncle Jamie made them go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he,\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>Janet bit her lip, twisting her hands in her apron. Suddenly she looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cAunt\u2014I\u2019m so awfully sorry!\u201d Her eyes were a warm brown, like her father\u2019s, but swimming now with tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said, having no idea what she meant, but trying to be soothing.</p><p>\u201cBut it was me!\u201d she burst out. She looked thoroughly miserable, but determined to confess. \u201cI\u2014I told Laoghaire ye were here. That\u2019s why she came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Well, that explained that, I supposed. I finished the whisky and set the glass carefully back on the tray.</p><p>\u201cI didna think\u2014I mean, I didna have it in mind to cause a kebbie-lebbie, truly not. I didna ken that you\u2014that she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said again. \u201cOne of us would have found out sooner or later.\u201d It made no difference, but I glanced at her with some curiosity. \u201cWhy did you tell her, though?\u201d</p><p>The girl glanced cautiously over her shoulder, hearing steps start up from below. She leaned close to me.</p><p>\u201cMother told me to,\u201d she whispered. And with that, she rose and hastily left the room, brushing past her mother in the doorway.</p><p>I didn\u2019t ask. Jenny had found a dress for me\u2014one of the elder girls\u2019\u2014and there was no conversation beyond the necessary as she helped me into it.</p><p>When I was dressed and shod, my hair combed and put up, I turned to her.</p><p>\u201cI want to go,\u201d I said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue, but only looked me over, to see that I was strong enough. She nodded then, dark lashes covering the slanted blue eyes so like her brother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s best,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>It was late morning when I left Lallybroch for what I knew would be the last time. I had a dagger at my waist, for protection, though it was unlikely I would need it. My horse\u2019s saddlebags held food and several bottles of ale; enough to see me back to the stone circle. I had thought of taking back the pictures of Brianna from Jamie\u2019s coat, but after a moment\u2019s hesitation, had left them. She belonged to him forever, even if I didn\u2019t.</p><p>It was a cold autumn day, the morning\u2019s gray promise fulfilled with a mourning drizzle. No one was in sight near the house, as Jenny led the horse out of the stable, and held the bridle for me to mount.</p><p>I pulled the hood of my cloak farther forward, and nodded to her. Last time, we had parted with tears and embraces, as sisters. She let go the reins, and stood back, as I turned the horse\u2019s head toward the road.</p><p>\u201cGodspeed!\u201d I heard her call behind me. I didn\u2019t answer, nor did I look back.</p><p>I rode most of the day, without really noticing where I was going; taking heed only for the general direction, and letting the gelding pick his own way through the mountain passes.</p><p>I stopped when the light began to go; hobbled the horse to graze, lay down wrapped in my cloak, and dropped straight asleep, unwilling to stay awake for fear I might think, and remember. Numbness was my only refuge. I knew it would go, but I clung to its gray comfort so long as I might.</p><p>It was hunger that brought me unwillingly back to life the next day. I had not paused to eat through all the day before, nor when rising in the morning, but by noon my stomach had begun to register loud protests, and I stopped in a small glen beside a sparkling burn, and unwrapped the food that Jenny had slipped into my saddlebag.</p><p>There were oatcakes and ale, and several small loaves of fresh-baked bread, slit down the middle, stuffed with sheepmilk cheese and homemade pickle. Highland sandwiches, the hearty fare of shepherds and warriors, as characteristic of Lallybroch as peanut butter had been of Boston. Very suitable, that my quest should end with one of these.</p><p>I ate a sandwich, drank one of the stone bottles of ale, and swung back into the saddle, turning the horse\u2019s head to the northeast once more. Unfortunately, while the food had brought fresh strength to my body, it had given fresh life to my feelings as well. As we climbed higher and higher into the clouds, my spirits fell lower\u2014and they hadn\u2019t been high to begin with.</p><p>The horse was willing enough, but I wasn\u2019t. Near midafternoon, I felt that I simply couldn\u2019t go on. Leading the horse far enough into a small thicket that it wouldn\u2019t be noticeable from the road, I hobbled it loosely, and walked farther under the trees myself, \u2019til I came to the trunk of a fallen aspen, smooth-skinned, stained green with moss.</p><p>I sat slumped over, elbows on my knees and head on my hands. I ached in every joint. Not really from the encounter of the day before, or from the rigors of riding; from grief.</p><p>Constraint and judgment had been a great deal of my life. I had learned at some pains the art of healing; to give and to care, but always stopping short of that danger point where too much was given to make me effective. I had learned detachment and disengagement, to my cost.</p><p>With Frank, too, I had learned the balancing act of civility; kindness and respect that did not pass those unseen boundaries into passion. And Brianna? Love for a child cannot be free; from the first signs of movement in the womb, a devotion springs up as powerful as it is mindless, irresistible as the process of birth itself. But powerful as it is, it is a love always of control; one is in charge, the protector, the watcher, the guardian\u2014there is great passion in it, to be sure, but never abandon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Always, always, I had had to balance compassion with wisdom, love with judgment, humanity with ruthlessness.</p><p>Only with Jamie had I given everything I had, risked it all. I had thrown away caution and judgment and wisdom, along with the comforts and constraints of a hard-won career. I had brought him nothing but myself, been nothing but myself with him, given him soul as well as body, let him see me naked, trusted him to see me whole and cherish my frailties\u2014because he once had.</p><p>I had feared he couldn\u2019t, again. Or wouldn\u2019t. And then had known those few days of perfect joy, thinking that what had once been true was true once more; I was free to love him, with everything I had and was, and be loved with an honesty that matched my own.</p><p>The tears slid hot and wet between my fingers. I mourned for Jamie, and for what I had been, with him.</p> <p>Do you know, his voice said, whispering, what it means, to say again \u201cI love you,\u201d and to mean it?</p><p>I knew. And with my head in my hands beneath the pine trees, I knew I would never mean it again.</p><p>Sunk as I was in miserable contemplation, I didn\u2019t hear the footsteps until he was nearly upon me. Startled by the crack of a branch nearby, I rocketed off the fallen tree like a rising pheasant and whirled to face the attacker, heart in my mouth and dagger in hand.</p><p>\u201cChrist!\u201d My stalker shied back from the open blade, clearly as startled as I was.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d I demanded. I pressed my free hand to my chest. My heart was pounding like a kettledrum and I was sure I was as white as he was.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Auntie Claire! Where\u2019d ye learn to pull a knife like that? Ye scairt hell out of me.\u201d Young Ian passed a hand over his brow, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is mutual,\u201d I assured him. I tried to sheathe the dagger, but my hand was shaking too much with reaction to manage it. Knees wobbling, I sank back on the aspen trunk and laid the knife on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cI repeat,\u201d I said, trying to gain mastery of myself, \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d I had a bloody good idea what he was doing there, and I wasn\u2019t having any. On the other hand, I needed a moment\u2019s recovery from the fright before I could reliably stand up.</p><p>Young Ian bit his lip, glanced around, and at my nod of permission, sat down awkwardly on the trunk beside me.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie sent me\u2014\u201d he began. I didn\u2019t pause to hear more, but got up at once, knees or no knees, thrusting the dagger into my belt as I turned away.</p><p>\u201cWait, Aunt! Please!\u201d He grabbed at my arm, but I jerked loose, pulling away from him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d I said, kicking the fronds of bracken aside. \u201cGo home, wee Ian. I\u2019ve places to go.\u201d I hoped I had, at least.</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t what you think!\u201d Unable to stop me leaving the clearing, he was following me, arguing as he ducked low branches. \u201cHe needs you, Aunt, really he does! Ye must come back wi\u2019 me!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer him; I had reached my horse, and bent to undo the hobbles.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Claire! Will ye no listen to me?\u201d He loomed up on the far side of the horse, gawky height peering at me over the saddle. He looked very much like his father, his good-natured, half-homely face creased with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said briefly. I stuffed the hobbles into the saddlebag, and put my foot into the stirrup, swinging up with a satisfyingly majestic swish of skirts and petticoats. My dignified departure was hampered at this point by the fact that Young Ian had the horse\u2019s reins in a death grip.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d I said peremptorily.</p><p>\u201cNot until ye hear me out,\u201d he said. He glared up at me, jaw clenched with stubbornness, soft brown eyes ablaze. I glared back at him. Gangling as he was, he had Ian\u2019s skinny muscularity; unless I was prepared to ride him down, there seemed little choice but to listen to him.</p><p>All right, I decided. Fat lot of good it would do, to him or his double-dealing uncle, but I\u2019d listen.</p> <p>\u201cTalk,\u201d I said, mustering what patience I could.</p><p>He drew a deep breath, eyeing me warily to see whether I meant it. Deciding that I did, he blew his breath out, making the soft brown hair over his brow flutter, and squared his shoulders to begin.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he started, seeming suddenly unsure. \u201cIt...I...he...\u201d</p><p>I made a low sound of exasperation in my throat. \u201cStart at the beginning,\u201d I said. \u201cBut don\u2019t make a song and dance of it, hm?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, teeth set in his upper lip as he concentrated.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was the hell of a stramash broke out at the house, after ye left, when Uncle Jamie came back,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet there was,\u201d I said. Despite myself, I was conscious of a small stirring of curiosity, but fought it down, assuming an expression of complete indifference.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Uncle Jamie sae furious,\u201d he said, watching my face carefully. \u201cNor Mother, either. They went at it hammer and tongs, the two o\u2019 them. Father tried to quiet them, but it was like they didna even hear him. Uncle Jamie called Mother a meddling besom, and a lang-nebbit...and...and a lot of worse names,\u201d he added, flushing.</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been angry with Jenny,\u201d I said. \u201cShe was only trying to help\u2014I think.\u201d I felt sick with the knowledge that I had caused this rift, too. Jenny had been Jamie\u2019s mainstay since the death of their mother when both were children. Was there no end to the damage I had caused by coming back?</p><p>To my surprise, Jenny\u2019s son smiled briefly. \u201cWell, it wasna all one-sided,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cMy mother\u2019s no the person to be taking abuse lying down, ye ken. Uncle Jamie had a few toothmarks on him before the end of it.\u201d He swallowed, remembering.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I thought they\u2019d damage each other, surely; Mother went for Uncle Jamie wi\u2019 an iron girdle, and he snatched it from her and threw it through the kitchen window. Scairt the chickens out o\u2019 the yard,\u201d he added, with a feeble grin.</p><p>\u201cLess about chickens, Young Ian,\u201d I said, looking down at him coldly. \u201cGet on with it; I want to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then Uncle Jamie knocked over the bookshelf in the parlor\u2014I dinna think he did it on purpose,\u201d the lad added hastily, \u201che was just too fashed to see straight\u2014and went out the door. Father stuck his head out the window and shouted at him where was he going, and he said he was going to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here, and not him?\u201d I was leaning forward slightly, watching his hand on the reins; if his fingers showed signs of relaxation, perhaps I could twitch the rein out of his grasp.</p><p>Young Ian sighed. \u201cWell, just as Uncle Jamie was setting out on his horse, Aunt...er...I mean his wi\u2014\u201d He blushed miserably. \u201cLaoghaire. She...she came down the hill and into the dooryard.\u201d</p><p>At this point, I gave up pretending indifference.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened then?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThere was an awful collieshangie, but I couldna hear much. Auntie...I mean Laoghaire\u2014she doesna seem to know how to fight properly, like my Mam and Uncle Jamie. She just weeps and wails a lot. Mam says she snivels,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd so?\u201d</p><p>Laoghaire had slid off her own mount, clutched Jamie by the leg, and more or less dragged him off as well, according to Young Ian. She had then subsided into a puddle in the dooryard, clutching Jamie about the knees, weeping and wailing as was her usual habit.</p><p>Unable to escape, Jamie had at last hauled Laoghaire to her feet, flung her bodily over his shoulder, and carried her into the house and up the stairs, ignoring the fascinated gazes of his family and servants.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said. I realized that I had been clenching my jaw, and consciously unclenched it. \u201cSo he sent you after me because he was too occupied with his wife. Bastard! The gall of him! He thinks he can just send someone to fetch me back, like a hired girl, because it doesn\u2019t suit his convenience to come himself? He thinks he can have his cake and eat it, does he? Bloody arrogant, selfish, overbearing...Scot!\u201d Distracted as I was by the picture of Jamie carrying Laoghaire upstairs, \u201cScot\u201d was the worst epithet I could come up with on short notice.</p><p>My knuckles were white where my hand clutched the edge of the saddle. Not caring about subtlety any more, I leaned down, snatching for the reins.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Auntie Claire, it\u2019s not that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not that?\u201d Caught by his tone of desperation, I glanced up. His long, narrow face was tight with the anguished need to make me understand.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie didna stay to tend Laoghaire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did he send you?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, renewing his grip on my reins.</p><p>\u201cShe shot him. He sent me to find ye, because he\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lying to me, Ian Murray,\u201d I said, for the dozenth time, \u201cyou\u2019ll regret it to the end of your life\u2014which will be short!\u201d</p><p>I had to raise my voice to be heard. The rising wind came whooshing past me, lifting my hair in streamers off my shoulders, whipping my skirts tight around my legs. The weather was suitably dramatic; great black clouds choked the mountain passes, boiling over the crags like seafoam, with a faint distant rumble of thunder, like far-off surf on packed sand.</p><p>Lacking breath, Young Ian merely shook his bowed head as he leaned into the wind. He was afoot, leading both ponies across a treacherously boggy stretch of ground near the edge of a tiny loch. I glanced instinctively at my wrist, missing my Rolex.</p><p>It was difficult to tell where the sun was, with the in-rolling storm filling half the western sky, but the upper edge of the dark-tinged clouds glowed a brilliant white that was almost gold. I had lost the knack of telling time by sun and sky, but thought it was no more than midafternoon.</p><p>Lallybroch lay several hours ahead; I doubted we would reach it by dark. Meaching my way reluctantly toward Craigh na Dun, I had taken nearly two days to reach the small wood where Young Ian had caught up with me. He had, he said, spent only one day in the pursuit; he had known roughly where I was headed, and he himself had shod the pony I rode; my tracks had been plain to him, where they showed in the mud-patches among the heather on the open moor.</p><p>Two days since I had left, and one\u2014or more\u2014on the journey back. Three days, then, since Jamie had been shot.</p><p>I could get few useful details from Young Ian; having succeeded in his mission, he wanted only to return to Lallybroch as fast as possible, and saw no point in further conversation. Jamie\u2019s gunshot wound was in the left arm, he said. That was good, so far as it went. The ball had penetrated into Jamie\u2019s side, as well. That wasn\u2019t good. Jamie was conscious when last seen\u2014that was good\u2014but was starting a fever. Not good at all. As to the possible effects of shock, the type or severity of the fever, or what treatment had so far been administered, Young Ian merely shrugged.</p><p>So perhaps Jamie was dying; perhaps he wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a chance I could take, as Jamie himself would know perfectly well. I wondered momentarily whether he might conceivably have shot himself, as a means of forcing me to return. Our last interview could have left him in little doubt as to my response had he come after me, or used force to make me return. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was beginning to rain, in soft spatters that caught in my hair and lashes, blurring my sight like tears. Past the boggy spot, Young Ian had mounted again, leading the way upward to the final pass that led to Lallybroch.</p><p>Jamie was devious enough to have thought of such a plan, all right, and certainly courageous enough to have carried it out. On the other hand, I had never known him to be reckless. He had taken plenty of bold risks\u2014marrying me being one of them, I thought ruefully\u2014but never without an estimation of the cost, and a willingness to pay it. Would he have thought drawing me back to Lallybroch worth the chance of actually dying? That hardly seemed logical, and Jamie Fraser was a very logical man.</p><p>I pulled the hood of my cloak further over my head, to keep the increasing downpour out of my face. Young Ian\u2019s shoulders and thighs were dark with wet, and the rain dripped from the brim of his slouch hat, but he sat straight in the saddle, ignoring the weather with the stoic nonchalance of a trueborn Scot.</p><p>Very well. Given that Jamie likely hadn\u2019t shot himself, was he shot at all? He might have made up the story, and sent his nephew to tell it. On consideration, though, I thought it highly unlikely that Young Ian could have delivered the news so convincingly, were it false.</p> <p>I shrugged, the movement sending a cold rivulet down inside the front of my cloak, and set myself to wait with what patience I could for the journey to be ended. Years in the practice of medicine had taught me not to anticipate; the reality of each case was bound to be unique, and so must be my response to it. My emotions, however, were much harder to control than my professional reactions.</p><p>Each time I had left Lallybroch, I had thought I would never return. Now here I was, going back once more. Twice now, I had left Jamie, knowing with certainty that I would never see him again. And yet here I was, going back to him like a bloody homing pigeon to its loft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, Jamie Fraser,\u201d I muttered under my breath. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t at death\u2019s door when I get there, you\u2019ll live to regret it!\u201d</p><p>36</p><p>PRACTICAL AND APPLIED WITCHCRAFT</p> <p>It was several hours past dark when we arrived at last, soaked to the skin. The house was silent, and dark, save for two dimly lighted windows downstairs in the parlor. There was a single warning bark from one of the dogs, but Young Ian shushed the animal, and after a quick, curious nosing at my stirrup, the black-and-white shape faded back into the darkness of the dooryard.</p><p>The warning had been enough to alert someone; as Young Ian led me into the hall, the door to the parlor opened. Jenny poked her head out, her face drawn with worry.</p><p>At the sight of Young Ian, she popped out into the hallway, her expression transformed to one of joyous relief, at once superseded by the righteous anger of a mother confronted by an errant offspring.</p><p>\u201cIan, ye wee wretch!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere have ye been all this time? Your Da and I ha\u2019 been worrit sick for ye!\u201d She paused long enough to look him over anxiously. \u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>At his nod, her lips grew tight again. \u201cAye, well. You\u2019re for it now, laddie, I\u2019ll tell ye! And just where the devil have ye been, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Gangling, knob-jointed, and dripping wet, Young Ian looked like nothing so much as a drowned scarecrow, but he was still large enough to block me from his mother\u2019s view. He didn\u2019t answer Jenny\u2019s scolding, but shrugged awkwardly and stepped aside, exposing me to his mother\u2019s startled gaze.</p> <p>If my resurrection from the dead had disconcerted her, this second reappearance stunned her. Her deep blue eyes, normally as slanted as her brother\u2019s, opened so wide, they looked round. She stared at me for a long moment, without saying anything, then her gaze swiveled once more to her son.</p><p>\u201cA cuckoo,\u201d she said, almost conversationally. \u201cThat\u2019s what ye are, laddie\u2014a great cuckoo in the nest. God knows whose son ye were meant to be; it wasna mine.\u201d</p><p>Young Ian flushed hotly, dropping his eyes as the red burned in his cheeks. He pushed the feathery damp hair out of his eyes with the back of one hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014well, I just...\u201d he began, eyes on his boots, \u201cI couldna just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, never mind about it now!\u201d his mother snapped. \u201cGet ye upstairs to your bed; your Da will deal wi\u2019 ye in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced helplessly at the parlor door, then at me. He shrugged once more, looked at the sodden hat in his hands as though wondering how it had got there, and shuffled slowly down the hall.</p><p>Jenny stood quite still, eyes fixed on me, until the padded door at the end of the hallway closed with a soft thump behind Young Ian. Her face showed lines of strain, and the shadows of sleeplessness smudged her eyes. Still fineboned and erect, for once she looked her age, and more.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re back,\u201d she said flatly.</p> <p>Seeing no point in answering the obvious, I nodded briefly. The house was quiet around us, and full of shadows, the hallway lighted only by a three-pronged candlestick set on the table.</p><p>\u201cNever mind about it now,\u201d I said, softly, so as not to disturb the house\u2019s slumber. There was, after all, only one thing of importance at the moment. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jamie?\u201d</p><p>After a small hesitation, she nodded as well, accepting my presence for the moment. \u201cIn there,\u201d she said, waving toward the parlor door.</p><p>I started toward the door, then paused. There was the one thing more. \u201cWhere\u2019s Laoghaire?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGone,\u201d she said. Her eyes were flat and dark in the candlelight, unreadable.</p><p>I nodded in response, and stepped through the door, closing it gently but firmly behind me.</p><p>Too long to be laid on the sofa, Jamie lay on a camp bed set up before the fire. Asleep or unconscious, his profile rose dark and sharp-edged against the light of the glowing coals, unmoving.</p><p>Whatever he was, he wasn\u2019t dead\u2014at least not yet. My eyes growing accustomed to the dim light of the fire, I could see the slow rise and fall of his chest beneath nightshirt and quilt. A flask of water and a brandy bottle sat on the small table by the bed. The padded chair by the fire had a shawl thrown over its back; Jenny had been sitting there, watching over her brother.</p><p>There seemed no need now for haste. I untied the strings at the neck of my cloak, and spread the soggy garment over the chairback, taking the shawl in substitute. My hands were cold; I put them under my arms, hugging myself, to bring them to something like a normal temperature before I touched him.</p><p>When I did venture to place a thawed hand on his forehead, I nearly jerked it back. He was hot as a just-fired pistol, and he twitched and moaned at my touch. Fever, indeed. I stood looking down at him for a moment, then carefully moved to the side of the bed and sat down in Jenny\u2019s chair. I didn\u2019t think he would sleep long, with a temperature like that, and it seemed a shame to wake him needlessly soon, merely to examine him.</p><p>The cloak behind me dripped water on the floor, a slow, arrhythmic patting. It reminded me unpleasantly of an old Highland superstition\u2014the \u201cdeath-drop.\u201d Just before a death occurs, the story goes, the sound of water dripping is heard in the house, by those sensitive to such things.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t, thank heaven, subject to noticing supernatural phenomena of that sort. No, I thought wryly, it takes something like a crack through time to get your attention. The thought made me smile, if only briefly, and dispelled the frisson I had felt at the thought of the death-drop.</p><p>As the rain chill left me, though, I still felt uneasy, and for obvious reasons. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that I had stood by another makeshift bed, deep in the night-watches, and contemplated death, and the waste of a marriage. The thoughts I had begun in the wood hadn\u2019t stopped on the hasty journey back to Lallybroch, and they continued now, without my conscious volition.</p><p>Honor had led Frank to his decision\u2014to keep me as his wife, and raise Brianna as his own. Honor, and an unwillingness to decline a responsibility he felt was his. Well, here before me lay another honorable man.</p><p>Laoghaire and her daughters, Jenny and her family, the Scots prisoners, the smugglers, Mr. Willoughby and Geordie, Fergus and the tenants\u2014how many other responsibilities had Jamie shouldered, through our years apart?</p><p>Frank\u2019s death had absolved me of one of my own obligations; Brianna herself of another. The Hospital Board, in their eternal wisdom, had severed the single great remaining tie that bound me to that life. I had had time, with Joe Abernathy\u2019s help, to relieve myself of the smaller responsibilities, to depute and delegate, divest and resolve.</p><p>Jamie had had neither warning nor choice about my reappearance in his life; no time to make decisions or resolve conflicts. And he was not one to abandon his responsibilities, even for the sake of love.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d lied to me. Hadn\u2019t trusted me to recognize his responsibilities, to stand by him\u2014or to leave him\u2014as his circumstances demanded. He\u2019d been afraid. So had I; afraid that he wouldn\u2019t choose me, confronted with the struggle between a twenty-year-old love and a present-day family. So I\u2019d run away.</p><p>\u201cWho you jiving, L.J.?\u201d I heard Joe Abernathy\u2019s voice say, derisive and affectionate. I had fled toward Craigh na Dun with all the speed and decision of a condemned felon approaching the steps of the gallows. Nothing had slowed my journey but the hope that Jamie would come after me.</p><p>True, the pangs of conscience and wounded pride had spurred me on, but the one moment when Young Ian had said, \u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d had shown those up for the flimsy things they were.</p><p>My marriage to Jamie had been for me like the turning of a great key, each small turn setting in play the intricate fall of tumblers within me. Bree had been able to turn that key as well, edging closer to the unlocking of the door of myself. But the final turn of the lock was frozen\u2014until I had walked into the printshop in Edinburgh, and the mechanism had sprung free with a final, decisive click. The door now was ajar, the light of an unknown future shining through its crack. But it would take more strength than I had alone to push it open.</p><p>I watched the rise and fall of his breath, and the play of light and shadow on the strong, clean lines of his face, and knew that nothing truly mattered between us but the fact that we both still lived. So here I was. Again. And whatever the cost of it might be to him or me, here I stayed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize that his eyes had opened until he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYe came back, then,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI knew ye would.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply, but he was still talking, eyes fixed on my face, pupils dilated to pools of darkness.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he said, almost whispering. \u201cGod, ye do look so lovely, wi\u2019 your great eyes all gold, and your hair so soft round your face.\u201d He brushed his tongue across dry lips. \u201cI knew ye must forgive me, Sassenach, once ye knew.\u201d</p><p>Once I knew? My brows shot up, but I didn\u2019t speak; he had more to say.</p><p>\u201cI was so afraid to lose ye again, mo chridhe,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSo afraid. I havena loved anyone but you, my Sassenach, never since the day I saw ye\u2014but I couldna...I couldna bear...\u201d His voice drifted off in an unintelligible mumble, and his eyes closed again, lashes lying dark against the high curve of his cheek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat still, wondering what I should do. As I watched, his eyes opened suddenly once again. Heavy and drowsy with fever, they sought my face.</p><p>\u201cIt willna be long, Sassenach,\u201d he said, as though reassuring me. One corner of his mouth twitched in an attempt at a smile. \u201cNot long. Then I shall touch ye once more. I do long to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jamie,\u201d I said. Moved by tenderness, I reached out and laid my hand along his burning cheek.</p><p>His eyes snapped wide with shock, and he jerked bolt upright in bed, letting out a bloodcurdling yell of anguish as the movement jarred his wounded arm.</p> <p>\u201cOh God, oh Christ, oh Jesus Lord God Almighty!\u201d he said, bent half-breathless and clutching at his left arm. \u201cYou\u2019re real! Bloody stinking filthy pig-swiving hell! Oh, Christ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I said, rather inanely. I could hear startled exclamations from the floor above, muffled by the thick planks, and the thump of feet as one after another of Lallybroch\u2019s inhabitants leapt from their beds to investigate the uproar.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s head, eyes even wider than before, poked through the parlor door. Jamie saw her, and somehow found sufficient breath to roar \u201cGet out!\u201d before doubling up again with an agonized groan.</p><p>\u201cJe-sus,\u201d he said between clenched teeth. \u201cWhat in God\u2019s holy name are ye doing here, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what am I doing here?\u201d I said. \u201cYou sent for me. And what do you mean, I\u2019m real?\u201d</p> <p>He unclenched his jaw and tentatively loosened his grip on his left arm. The resultant sensation proving unsatisfactory, he promptly grabbed it again and said several things in French involving the reproductive organs of assorted saints and animals.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, lie down!\u201d I said. I took him by the shoulders and eased him back onto the pillows, noting with some alarm how close his bones were to the surface of his heated skin.</p><p>\u201cI thought ye were a fever dream, \u2019til you touched me,\u201d he said, gasping. \u201cWhat the hell d\u2019ye mean, popping up by my bed and scarin\u2019 me to death?\u201d He grimaced in pain. \u201cChrist, it feels like my damn arm\u2019s come off at the shoulder. Och, bugger it!\u201d he exclaimed, as I firmly detached the fingers of his right hand from his left arm.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you send Young Ian to tell me you were dying?\u201d I said, deftly rolling back the sleeve of his nightshirt. The arm was wound in a huge bandage above the elbow, and I groped for the end of the linen strip.</p><p>\u201cMe? No! Ow, that hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt worse before I\u2019m through with you,\u201d I said, carefully unwrapping. \u201cYou mean the little bastard came after me on his own? You didn\u2019t want me to come back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant ye back? No! Want ye to come back to me for nothing but pity, the same as ye might show for a dog in a ditch? Bloody hell! No! I forbade the little bugger to go after ye!\u201d He scowled furiously at me, ruddy brows knitting together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor,\u201d I said coldly, \u201cnot a veterinarian. And if you didn\u2019t want me back, what was all that you were saying before you realized I was real, hm? Bite the blanket or something; the end\u2019s stuck, and I\u2019m going to pull it loose.\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip instead, and made no noise but a swift intake of air through his nose. It was impossible to judge his color in the firelight, but his eyes closed briefly, and small beads of sweat popped out on his forehead.</p><p>I turned away for a moment, groping in the drawer of Jenny\u2019s desk where the extra candles were kept. I needed more light before I did anything.</p><p>\u201cI suppose Young Ian told me you were dying just to get me back here. He must have thought I wouldn\u2019t come otherwise.\u201d The candles were there; fine beeswax, from the Lallybroch hives.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I am dying.\u201d His voice came from behind me, dry and blunt, despite his breathlessness.</p><p>I turned back to him in some surprise. His eyes rested on my face quite calmly, now that the pain in his arm had lessened a bit, but his breath was still coming unevenly, and his eyes were heavy and bright with fever. I didn\u2019t respond at once, but lit the candles I had found, placing them in the big candelabra that usually decorated the sideboard, unused save for great occasions. The flames of five additional candles brightened the room as though in preparation for a party. I bent over the bed, noncommital.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look at it.\u201d</p> <p>The wound itself was a ragged dark hole, scabbed at the edges and faintly blue-tinged. I pressed the flesh on either side of the wound; it was red and angry-looking, and there was a considerable seepage of pus. Jamie stirred uneasily as I drew my fingertips gently but firmly down the length of the muscle.</p><p>\u201cYou have the makings of a very fine little infection there, my lad,\u201d I said. \u201cYoung Ian said it went into your side; a second shot, or did it go through your arm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went through. Jenny dug the ball out of my side. That wasna so bad, though. Just an inch or so in.\u201d He spoke in brief spurts, lips tightening involuntarily between sentences.</p><p>\u201cLet me see where it went through.\u201d</p><p>Moving very slowly, he turned his hand to the outside, letting the arm fall away from his side. I could see that even that small movement was intensely painful. The exit wound was just above the elbow joint, on the inside of the upper arm. Not directly opposite the entrance wound, though; the ball had been deflected in its passage.</p><p>\u201cHit the bone,\u201d I said, trying not to imagine what that must have felt like. \u201cDo you know if the bone\u2019s broken? I don\u2019t want to poke you more than I need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for small mercies,\u201d he said, with an attempt at a smile. The muscles of his face trembled, though, and went slack with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s not broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve broken my collarbone and my hand before, and it\u2019s not like that, though it hurts a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect it does.\u201d I felt my way carefully up the swell of his biceps, testing for tenderness. \u201cHow far up does the pain go?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his wounded arm, almost casually. \u201cFeels like I\u2019ve a hot poker in my arm, not a bone. But it\u2019s no just the arm pains me now; my whole side\u2019s gone stiff and sore.\u201d He swallowed, licking his lips again. \u201cWill ye give me a taste of the brandy?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt hurts to feel my heart beating,\u201d he added apologetically.</p><p>Without comment, I poured a cup of water from the flask on the table, and held it to his lips. He raised one brow, but drank thirstily, then let his head fall back against the pillow. He breathed deeply for a moment, eyes closed, then opened them and looked directly at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had two fevers in my life that near killed me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this one likely will. I wouldna send for ye, but...I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He swallowed once, then went on. \u201cI...wanted to say to ye that I\u2019m sorry. And to bid ye a proper farewell. I wouldna ask ye to stay \u2019til the end, but...would ye...would ye stay wi\u2019 me\u2014just for a bit?\u201d</p><p>His right hand was pressed flat against the mattress, steadying him. I could see that he was fighting hard to keep any note of pleading from his voice or eyes, to make it a simple request, one that could be refused.</p><p>I sat down on the bed beside him, careful not to jar him. The firelight glowed on one side of his face, sparking the red-gold stubble of his beard, picking up the small flickers of silver here and there, leaving the other side masked in shadow. He met my eyes, not blinking. I hoped the yearning that showed in his face was not quite so apparent on my own.</p><p>I reached out and ran a hand gently down the side of his face, feeling the soft scratchiness of beard stubble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay for a bit,\u201d I said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to die.\u201d</p><p>He raised one eyebrow. \u201cYou brought me through one bad fever, using what I still think was witchcraft. And Jenny got me through the next, wi\u2019 naught but plain stubbornness. I suppose wi\u2019 the both of ye here, ye might just manage it, but I\u2019m no at all sure I want to go through such an ordeal again. I think I\u2019d rather just die and ha\u2019 done with it, if it\u2019s all the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIngrate,\u201d I said. \u201cCoward.\u201d Torn between exasperation and tenderness, I patted his cheek and stood up, groping in the deep pocket of my skirt. There was one item I had carried on my person at all times, not trusting it to the vagaries of travel.</p><p>I laid the small, flat case on the table and flipped the latch. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you die this time either,\u201d I informed him, \u201cgreatly as I may be tempted.\u201d I carefully extracted the roll of gray flannel and laid it on the table with a soft clinking noise. I unrolled the flannel, displaying the gleaming row of syringes, and rummaged in the box for the small bottle of penicillin tablets.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are those?\u201d Jamie asked, eyeing the syringes with interest. \u201cThey look wicked sharp.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, occupied in dissolving the penicillin tablets in the vial of sterile water. I selected a glass barrel, fitted a needle, and pressed the tip through the rubber covering the mouth of the bottle. Holding it up to the light, I pulled back slowly on the plunger, watching the thick white liquid fill the barrel, checking for bubbles. Then pulling the needle free, I depressed the plunger slightly until a drop of liquid pearled from the point and rolled slowly down the length of the spike.</p><p>\u201cRoll onto your good side,\u201d I said, turning to Jamie, \u201cand pull up your shirt.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the needle in my hand with keen suspicion, but reluctantly obeyed. I surveyed the terrain with approval.</p><p>\u201cYour bottom hasn\u2019t changed a bit in twenty years,\u201d I remarked, admiring the muscular curves.</p><p>\u201cNeither has yours,\u201d he replied courteously, \u201cbut I\u2019m no insisting you expose it. Are ye suffering a sudden attack of lustfulness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just at present,\u201d I said evenly, swabbing a patch of skin with a cloth soaked in brandy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a verra nice make of brandy,\u201d he said, peering back over his shoulder, \u201cbut I\u2019m more accustomed to apply it at the other end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also the best source of alcohol available. Hold still now, and relax.\u201d I jabbed deftly and pressed the plunger slowly in.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Jamie rubbed his posterior resentfully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll stop stinging in a minute.\u201d I poured an inch of brandy into the cup. \u201cNow you can have a bit to drink\u2014a very little bit.\u201d</p><p>He drained the cup without comment, watching me roll up the collection of syringes. Finally he said, \u201cI thought ye stuck pins in ill-wish dolls when ye meant to witch someone; not in the people themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a pin, it\u2019s a hypodermic syringe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna care what ye call it; it felt like a bloody horseshoe nail. Would ye care to tell me why jabbing pins in my arse is going to help my arm?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cWell, do you remember my once telling you about germs?\u201d</p><p>He looked quite blank.</p><p>\u201cLittle beasts too small to see,\u201d I elaborated. \u201cThey can get into your body through bad food or water, or through open wounds, and if they do, they can make you ill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at his arm with interest. \u201cI\u2019ve germs in my arm, have I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou very definitely have.\u201d I tapped a finger on the small flat box. \u201cThe medicine I just shot into your backside kills germs, though. You get another shot every four hours \u2019til this time tomorrow, and then we\u2019ll see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>I paused. Jamie was staring at me, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d I asked. He nodded slowly.</p> <p>\u201cAye, I do. I should ha\u2019 let them burn ye, twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>37</p><p>WHAT\u2019S IN A NAME</p><p>After giving him a shot and settling him comfortably, I sat watching until he fell asleep again, allowing him to hold my hand until his own grip relaxed in sleep and the big hand dropped slack by his side.</p><p>I sat by his bed for the rest of the night, dozing sometimes, and rousing myself by means of the internal clock all doctors have, geared to the rhythms of a hospital\u2019s shift changes. Two more shots, the last at daybreak, and by then the fever had loosed its hold perceptibly. He was still very warm to the touch, but his flesh no longer burned, and he rested easier, falling asleep after the last shot with no more than a few grumbles and a faint moan as his arm twinged.</p> <p>\u201cBloody eighteenth-century germs are no match for penicillin,\u201d I told his sleeping form. \u201cNo resistance. Even if you had syphilis, I\u2019d have it cleaned up in no time.\u201d</p><p>And what then? I wondered, as I staggered off to the kitchen in search of hot tea and food. A strange woman, presumably the cook or the housemaid, was firing up the brick oven, ready to receive the daily loaves that lay rising in their pans on the table. She didn\u2019t seem surprised to see me, but cleared away a small space for me to sit down, and brought me tea and fresh girdle-cakes with no more than a quick \u201cGood mornin\u2019 to ye, mum\u201d before returning to her work.</p><p>Evidently, Jenny had informed the household of my presence. Did that mean she accepted it herself? I doubted it. Clearly, she had wanted me to go, and wasn\u2019t best pleased to have me back. If I was going to stay, there was plainly going to be a certain amount of explanation about Laoghaire, from both Jenny and Jamie. And I was going to stay.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said politely to the cook, and taking a fresh cup of tea with me, went back to the parlor to wait until Jamie saw fit to wake up again.</p><p>People passed by the door during the morning, pausing now and then to peep through, but always went on hurriedly when I looked up. At last, Jamie showed signs of waking, just before noon; he stirred, sighed, groaned as the movement jarred his arm, and subsided once more.</p><p>I gave him a few moments to realize that I was there, but his eyes stayed shut. He wasn\u2019t asleep, though; the lines of his body were slightly tensed, not relaxed in slumber. I had watched him sleep all night; I knew the difference.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I leaned back in the chair, settling myself comfortably, well out of his reach. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it, then.\u201d</p><p>A small slit of blue showed under the long auburn lashes, then disappeared again.</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d he said, pretending to wake slowly. The lashes fluttered against his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stall,\u201d I said crisply. \u201cI know perfectly well you\u2019re awake. Open your eyes and tell me about Laoghaire.\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes opened and rested on me with an expression of some disfavor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no afraid of giving me a relapse?\u201d he inquired. \u201cI\u2019ve always heard sick folk shouldna be troubled owermuch. It sets them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a doctor right here,\u201d I assured him. \u201cIf you pass out from the strain, I\u2019ll know what to do about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d His narrowed gaze flicked to the little case of drugs and hypodermics on the table, then back to me. \u201cMy arse feels like I\u2019ve sat in a gorse bush wi\u2019 no breeks on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said pleasantly. \u201cYou\u2019ll get another one in an hour. Right now, you\u2019re going to talk.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed tight together, but then relaxed as he sighed. He pushed himself laboriously upright against the pillows, one-handed. I didn\u2019t help him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said at last. He didn\u2019t look at me, but down at the quilt, where his finger traced the edge of the starred design.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was when I\u2019d come back from England.\u201d</p><p>He had come up from the Lake District and over the Carter\u2019s Bar, that great ridge of high ground that divides England from Scotland, on whose broad back the ancient courts and markets of the Borders had been held.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stone there to mark the border, maybe you\u2019ll know; it looks the sort of stone to last a while.\u201d He glanced at me, questioning, and I nodded. I did know it; a huge menhir, some ten feet tall. In my time, someone had carved on its one face ENGLAND, and on the other, SCOTLAND.</p><p>There he stopped to rest, as thousands of travelers had stopped over the years, his exiled past behind him, the future\u2014and home\u2014below and beyond, past the hazy green hollows of the Lowlands, up into the gray crags of the Highlands, hidden by fog.</p><p>His good hand ran back and forth through his hair, as it always did when he thought, leaving the cowlicks on top standing up in small, bright whorls.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not know how it is, to live among strangers for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t I?\u201d I said, with some sharpness. He glanced up at me, startled, then smiled faintly, looking down at the coverlet.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe ye will,\u201d he said. \u201cYe change, no? Much as ye want to keep the memories of home, and who ye are\u2014you\u2019re changed. Not one of the strangers; ye could never be that, even if ye wanted to. But different from who ye were, too.\u201d</p><p>I thought of myself, standing silent beside Frank, a bit of flotsam in the eddies of university parties, pushing a pram through the chilly parks of Boston, playing bridge and talking with other wives and mothers, speaking the foreign language of middle-class domesticity. Strangers indeed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI know. Get on.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, rubbing his nose with a forefinger. \u201cSo I came back,\u201d he said. He looked up, a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth. \u201cWhat is it ye told wee Ian? \u2018Home is the place where, when ye have to go there, they have to take ye in\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a quotation from a poet called Frost. But what do you mean? Surely your family was glad to see you!\u201d</p><p>He frowned, fingering the quilt. \u201cAye, they were,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that\u2014I dinna mean they made me feel unwelcome, not at all. But I had been away so long\u2014Michael and wee Janet and Ian didna even remember me.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cThey\u2019d heard about me, though. When I came into the kitchen, they\u2019d squash back against the walls and stare at me, wi\u2019 their eyes gone round.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward a little, intent on making me understand.</p><p>\u201cSee, it was different, when I hid in the cave. I wasna in the house, and they seldom saw me, but I was always here, I was always part of them. I hunted for them; I kent when they were hungry, or cold, or when the goats were ill or the kail crop poor, or a new draft under the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cThen I went to prison,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cAnd to England. I wrote to them\u2014and they to me\u2014but it canna be the same, to see a few black words on the paper, telling things that happened months before.</p><p>\u201cAnd when I came back\u2014\u201d He shrugged, wincing as the movement jarred his arm. \u201cIt was different. Ian would ask me what I thought of fencing in auld Kirby\u2019s pasture, but I\u2019d know he\u2019d already set Young Jamie to do it. I\u2019d walk through the fields, and folk would squint at me, suspicious, thinking me a stranger. Then their eyes would go big as they\u2019d seen a ghost, when they knew me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, looking out at the window, where the brambles of his mother\u2019s rose beat against the glass as the wind changed. \u201cI was a ghost, I think.\u201d He glanced at me shyly. \u201cIf ye ken what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. Rain was streaking the glass, with drops the same gray as the sky outside.</p><p>\u201cYou feel like your ties to the earth are broken,\u201d I said softly. \u201cFloating through rooms without feeling your footsteps. Hearing people speak to you, and not making sense of it. I remember that\u2014before Bree was born.\u201d But I had had one tie then; I had her, to anchor me to life.</p><p>He nodded, not looking at me, and then was quiet for a minute. The peat fire hissed on the hearth behind me, smelling of the Highlands, and the rich scent of cock-a-leekie and baking bread spread through the house, warm and comforting as a blanket.</p><p>\u201cI was here,\u201d he said softly, \u201cbut not home.\u201d</p><p>I could feel the pull of it around me\u2014the house, the family, the place itself. I, who couldn\u2019t remember a childhood home, felt the urge to sit down here and stay forever, enmeshed in the thousand strands of daily life, bound securely to this bit of earth. What would it have meant to him, who had lived all his life in the strength of that bond, endured his exile in the hope of coming back to it, and then arrived to find himself still rootless?</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose I was lonely,\u201d he said quietly. He lay still on the pillow, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you were,\u201d I said, careful to let no tone either of sympathy or condemnation show. I knew something of loneliness, too.</p><p>He opened his eyes then, and met my gaze with a naked honesty. \u201cAye, there was that too,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the main thing, no\u2014but aye, that too.\u201d</p><p>Jenny had tried, with varying degrees of gentleness and insistence, to persuade him to marry again. She had tried intermittently since the days after Culloden, presenting first one and then another personable young widow, this and that sweet-tempered virgin, all to no avail. Now, bereft of the feelings that had sustained him so far, desperately seeking some sense of connection\u2014he had listened.</p><p>\u201cLaoghaire was married to Hugh MacKenzie, one of Colum\u2019s tacksmen,\u201d he said, eyes closed once more. \u201cHugh was killed at Culloden, though, and two years later, Laoghaire married Simon MacKimmie of clan Fraser. The two lassies\u2014Marsali and Joan\u2014they\u2019re his. The English arrested him a few years later, and took him to prison in Edinburgh.\u201d He opened his eyes, looking up at the dark ceiling beams overhead. \u201cHe had a good house, and property worth seizing. That was enough to make a Highland man a traitor, then, whether he\u2019d fought for the Stuarts openly or not.\u201d His voice was growing hoarse, and he stopped to clear his throat.</p><p>\u201cSimon wasn\u2019t as lucky as I was. He died in prison, before they could bring him to trial. The Crown tried for some time to take the estate, but Ned Gowan went to Edinburgh, and spoke for Laoghaire, and he managed to save the main house and a little money, claiming it was her dower right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNed Gowan?\u201d I spoke with mingled surprise and pleasure. \u201cHe can\u2019t still be alive, surely?\u201d It was Ned Gowan, a small and elderly solicitor who advised the MacKenzie clan on legal matters, who had saved me from being burned as a witch, twenty years before. I had thought him quite ancient then. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie smiled, seeing my pleasure. \u201cOh, aye. I expect they\u2019ll have to knock him on the head wi\u2019 an ax to kill him. He looks just the same as he always did, though he must be past seventy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he still live at Castle Leoch?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, reaching to the table for the tumbler of water. He drank awkwardly, right-handed, and set it back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left of it. Aye, though he\u2019s traveled a great deal these last years, appealing treason cases and filing lawsuits to recover property.\u201d Jamie\u2019s smile had a bitter edge. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying, aye? \u2018After a war, first come the corbies to eat the flesh; and then the lawyers, to pick the bones.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His right hand went to his left shoulder, massaging it unconsciously.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s a good man, is Ned, in spite of his profession. He goes back and forth to Inverness, to Edinburgh\u2014sometimes even to London or Paris. And he stops here from time to time, to break his journey.\u201d</p><p>It was Ned Gowan who had mentioned Laoghaire to Jenny, returning from Balriggan to Edinburgh. Pricking up her ears, Jenny had inquired for further details, and finding these satisfactory, had at once sent an invitation to Balriggan, for Laoghaire and her two daughters to come to Lallybroch for Hogmanay, which was near.</p><p>The house was bright that night, with candles lit in the windows, and bunches of holly and ivy fixed to the staircase and the doorposts. There were not so many pipers in the Highlands as there had been before Culloden, but one had been found, and a fiddler as well, and music floated up the stairwell, mixed with the heady scent of rum punch, plum cake, almond squirts, and Savoy biscuits.</p><p>Jamie had come down late and hesitant. Many people here he had not seen in nearly ten years, and he was not eager to see them now, feeling changed and distant as he did. But Jenny had made him a new shirt, brushed and mended his coat, and combed his hair smooth and plaited it for him before going downstairs to see to the cooking. He had no excuse to linger, and at last had come down, into the noise and swirl of the gathering.</p> <p>\u201cMister Fraser!\u201d Peggy Gibbons was the first to see him; she hurried across the room, face glowing, and threw her arms about him, quite unabashed. Taken by surprise, he hugged her back, and within moments was surrounded by a small crowd of women, exclaiming over him, holding up small children born since his departure, kissing his cheeks and patting his hands.</p><p>The men were shyer, greeting him with a gruff word of welcome or a slap on the back as he made his way slowly through the rooms, until, quite overwhelmed, he had escaped temporarily into the laird\u2019s study.</p><p>Once his father\u2019s room, and then his own, it now belonged to his brother-in-law, who had run Lallybroch through the years of his absence. The ledgers and stockbooks and accounts were all lined up neatly on the edge of the battered desk; he ran a finger along the leather spines, feeling a sense of comfort at the touch. It was all in here; the planting and the harvests, the careful purchases and acquisitions, the slow accumulations and dispersals that were the rhythm of life to the tenants of Lallybroch.</p><p>On the small bookshelf, he found his wooden snake. Along with everything else of value, he had left it behind when he went to prison. A small icon carved of cherrywood, it had been the gift of his elder brother, dead in childhood. He was sitting in the chair behind the desk, stroking the snake\u2019s well-worn curves, when the door of the study opened.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d she had said, hanging shyly back. He had not bothered to light a lamp in the study; she was silhouetted by the candles burning in the hall. She wore her pale hair loose, like a maid, and the light shone through it, haloing her unseen face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll remember me, maybe?\u201d she had said, tentative, reluctant to come into the room without invitation.</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, after a pause. \u201cAye, of course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe music\u2019s starting,\u201d she said. It was; he could hear the whine of the fiddle and the stamp of feet from the front parlor, along with an occasional shout of merriment. It showed signs of being a good party already; most of the guests would be asleep on the floor come morning.</p><p>\u201cYour sister says you\u2019re a bonny dancer,\u201d she said, still shy, but determined.</p><p>\u201cIt will ha\u2019 been some time since I tried,\u201d he said, feeling shy himself, and painfully awkward, though the fiddle music ached in his bones and his feet twitched at the sound of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Tha mo Leabaidh \u2019san Fhraoch\u2019\u2014\u2018In the Heather\u2019s my Bed\u2019\u2014you\u2019ll ken that one. Will ye come and try wi\u2019 me?\u201d She had held out a hand to him, small and graceful in the half-dark. And he had risen, clasped her outstretched hand in his own, and taken his first steps in pursuit of himself.</p><p>\u201cIt was in here,\u201d he said, waving his good hand at the room where we sat. \u201cJenny had had the furniture cleared away, all but one table wi\u2019 the food and the whisky, and the fiddler stood by the window there, wi\u2019 a new moon over his shoulder.\u201d He nodded at the window, where the rose vine trembled. Something of the light of that Hogmanay feast lingered on his face, and I felt a small pang, seeing it.</p><p>\u201cWe danced all that night, sometimes wi\u2019 others, but mostly with each other. And at the dawn, when those still awake went to the end o\u2019 the house to see what omens the New Year might bring, the two of us went, too. The single women took it in turns to spin about, and walk through the door wi\u2019 their eyes closed, then spin again and open their eyes to see what the first thing they might see would be\u2014for that tells them about the man they\u2019ll marry, ye ken.\u201d</p><p>There had been a lot of laughter, as the guests, heated by whisky and dancing, pushed and shoved at the door. Laoghaire had held back, flushed and laughing, saying it was a game for young girls, and not for a matron of thirty-four, but the others had insisted, and try she had. Spun three times clockwise and opened the door, stepped out into the cold dawnlight and spun again. And when she opened her eyes, they had rested on Jamie\u2019s face, wide with expectation.</p> <p>\u201cSo...there she was, a widow wi\u2019 two bairns. She needed a man, that was plain enough. I needed...something.\u201d He gazed into the fire, where the low flame glimmered through the red mass of the peat; heat without much light. \u201cI supposed that we might help each other.\u201d</p><p>They had married quietly at Balriggan, and he had moved his few possessions there. Less than a year later, he had moved out again, and gone to Edinburgh.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth happened?\u201d I asked, more than curious.</p><p>He looked up at me, helpless.</p><p>\u201cI canna say. It wasna that anything was wrong, exactly\u2014only that nothing was right.\u201d He rubbed a hand tiredly between his brows. \u201cIt was me, I think; my fault. I always disappointed her somehow. We\u2019d sit down to supper and all of a sudden the tears would well up in her eyes, and she\u2019d leave the table sobbing, and me sitting there wi\u2019 not a notion what I\u2019d done or said wrong.\u201d</p><p>His fist clenched on the coverlet, then relaxed. \u201cGod, I never knew what to do for her, or what to say! Anything I said just made it worse, and there would be days\u2014nay, weeks!\u2014when she\u2019d not speak to me, but only turn away when I came near her, and stand staring out the window until I went away again.\u201d</p><p>His fingers went to the parallel scratches down the side of his neck. They were nearly healed now, but the marks of my nails still showed on his fair skin. He looked at me wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou never did that to me, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my style,\u201d I agreed, smiling faintly. \u201cIf I\u2019m mad at you, you\u2019ll bloody know why, at least.\u201d</p><p>He snorted briefly and lay back on his pillows. Neither of us spoke for a bit. Then he said, staring up at the ceiling, \u201cI thought I didna want to hear anything about what it was like\u2014wi\u2019 Frank, I mean. I was maybe wrong about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not just now. It\u2019s still your turn.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe was afraid of me,\u201d he said softly, a minute later. \u201cI tried to be gentle wi\u2019 her\u2014God, I tried again and again, everything I knew to please a woman. But it was no use.\u201d</p><p>His head turned restlessly, making a hollow in the feather pillow.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was Hugh, or maybe Simon. I kent them both, and they were good men, but there\u2019s no telling what goes on in a marriage bed. Maybe it was bearing the children; not all women can stand it. But something hurt her, sometime, and I couldna heal it for all my trying. She shrank away when I touched her, and I could see the sickness and the fear in her eyes.\u201d There were lines of sorrow around his own closed eyes, and I reached impulsively for his hand.</p><p>He squeezed it gently and opened his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I left, finally,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI couldna bear it anymore.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, but went on holding his hand, putting a finger on his pulse to check it. His heartbeat was reassuringly slow and steady.</p><p>He shifted slightly in the bed, moving his shoulders and making a grimace of discomfort as he did so.</p><p>\u201cArm hurt a lot?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><p>I bent over him, feeling his brow. He was very warm, but not feverish. There was a line between the thick ruddy brows, and I smoothed it with a knuckle.</p><p>\u201cHead ache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and make you some willow-bark tea.\u201d I made to rise, but his hand on my arm stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI dinna need tea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would ease me, though, if maybe I could lay my head in your lap, and have ye rub my temples a bit?\u201d Blue eyes looked up at me, limpid as a spring sky.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fool me a bit, Jamie Fraser,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to forget about your next shot.\u201d Nonetheless, I was already moving the chair out of the way, and sitting down beside him on the bed.</p><p>He made a small grunting sound of content as I moved his head into my lap and began to stroke it, rubbing his temples, smoothing back the thick wavy mass of his hair. The back of his neck was damp; I lifted the hair away and blew softly on it, seeing the smooth fair skin prickle into gooseflesh at the nape of his neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, that feels good,\u201d he murmured. Despite my resolve not to touch him beyond the demands of caretaking until everything between us was resolved, I found my hands molding themselves to the clean, bold lines of his neck and shoulders, seeking the hard knobs of his vertebrae and the broad, flat planes of his shoulder blades.</p><p>He was firm and solid under my hands, his breath a warm caress on my thigh, and it was with some reluctance that I at last eased him back onto the pillow and reached for the ampule of penicillin.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, turning back the sheet and reaching for the hem of his shirt. \u201cA quick stick, and you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d My hand brushed over the front of his nightshirt, and I broke off, startled.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I said, amused. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna suppose I can,\u201d he agreed comfortably. He curled up on his side like a shrimp, his lashes dark against his cheek. \u201cBut a man can dream, no?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t go upstairs to bed that night, either. We didn\u2019t talk much, just lay close together in the narrow bed, scarcely moving, so as not to jar his injured arm. The rest of the house was quiet, everyone safely in bed, and there was no sound but the hissing of the fire, the sigh of the wind, and the scratch of Ellen\u2019s rosebush at the window, insistent as the demands of love.</p><p>\u201cDo ye know?\u201d he said softly, somewhere in the black, small hours of the night. \u201cDo ye know what it\u2019s like to be with someone that way? To try all ye can, and seem never to have the secret of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, thinking of Frank. \u201cYes, I do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought perhaps ye did.\u201d He was quiet for a moment, and then his hand touched my hair lightly, a shadowy blur in the firelight.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then...\u201d he whispered, \u201cthen to have it back again, that knowing. To be free in all ye say or do, and know that it is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say \u2018I love you,\u2019 and mean it with all your heart,\u201d I said softly to the dark.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he answered, barely audible. \u201cTo say that.\u201d</p><p>His hand rested on my hair, and without knowing quite how it happened, I found myself curled against him, my head just fitting in the hollow of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cFor so many years,\u201d he said, \u201cfor so long, I have been so many things, so many different men.\u201d I felt him swallow, and he shifted slightly, the linen of his nightshirt rustling with starch.</p> <p>\u201cI was Uncle to Jenny\u2019s children, and Brother to her and Ian. \u2018Milord\u2019 to Fergus, and \u2018Sir\u2019 to my tenants. \u2018Mac Dubh\u2019 to the men of Ardsmuir and \u2018MacKenzie\u2019 to the other servants at Helwater. \u2018Malcolm the printer,\u2019 then, and \u2018Jamie Roy\u2019 at the docks.\u201d The hand stroked my hair, slowly, with a whispering sound like the wind outside. \u201cBut here,\u201d he said, so softly I could barely hear him, \u201chere in the dark, with you...I have no name.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my face toward his, and took the warm breath of him between my own lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said, and did not need to tell him how I meant it.</p><p>38</p><p>I MEET A LAWYER</p><p>As I had predicted, eighteenth-century germs were no match for a modern antibiotic. Jamie\u2019s fever had virtually disappeared within twenty-four hours, and within the next two days the inflammation in his arm began to subside as well, leaving no more than a reddening about the wound itself and a very slight oozing of pus when pressed.</p> <p>On the fourth day, after satisfying myself that he was mending nicely, I dressed the wound lightly with coneflower salve, bandaged it again, and left to dress and make my own toilet upstairs.</p><p>Ian, Janet, Young Ian, and the servants had all put their heads in at intervals over the last few days, to see how Jamie progressed. Jenny had been conspicuously absent from these inquiries, but I knew that she was still entirely aware of everything that happened in her house. I hadn\u2019t announced my intention of coming upstairs, yet when I opened the door to my bedroom, there was a large pitcher of hot water standing by the ewer, gently steaming, and a fresh cake of soap laid alongside it.</p><p>I picked it up and sniffed. Fine-milled French soap, perfumed with lily of the valley, it was a delicate comment on my status in the household\u2014honored guest, to be sure; but not one of the family, who would all make do as a matter of course with the usual coarse soap made of tallow and lye.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d and lathered the cloth for washing.</p><p>As I was arranging my hair in the glass a half-hour later, I heard the sounds below of someone arriving. Several someones, in fact, from the sounds of it. I came down the stairs to find a small mob of children in residence, streaming in and out of the kitchen and front parlor, with here and there a strange adult visible in the midst of them, who stared curiously at me as I came down the stairs.</p><p>Entering the parlor, I found the camp bed put away and Jamie, shaved and in a fresh nightshirt, neatly propped up on the sofa under a quilt with his left arm in a sling, surrounded by four or five children. These were shepherded by Janet, Young Ian, and a smiling young man who was a Fraser of sorts by the shape of his nose, but otherwise bore only the faintest resemblances to the tiny boy I had seen last at Lallybroch twenty years before.</p><p>\u201cThere she is!\u201d Jamie exclaimed with pleasure at my appearance, and the entire roomful of people turned to look at me, with expressions ranging from pleasant greeting to gape-mouthed awe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll remember Young Jamie?\u201d the elder Jamie said, nodding to the tall, broad-shouldered young man with curly black hair and a squirming bundle in his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the curls,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cThe rest has changed a bit.\u201d</p><p>Young Jamie grinned down at me. \u201cI remember ye well, Auntie,\u201d he said, in a deep-brown voice like well-aged ale. \u201cYe held me on your knee and played Ten Wee Piggies wi\u2019 my toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t possibly have,\u201d I said, looking up at him in some dismay. While it seemed to be true that people really didn\u2019t change markedly in appearance between their twenties and their forties, they most assuredly did so between four and twenty-four.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps ye can have a go wi\u2019 wee Benjamin here,\u201d Young Jamie suggested with a smile. \u201cMaybe the knack of it will come back to ye.\u201d He bent and carefully laid his bundle in my arms.</p><p>A very round face looked up at me with that air of befuddlement so common to new babies. Benjamin appeared mildly confused at having me suddenly exchanged for his father, but didn\u2019t object. Instead, he opened his small pink mouth very wide, inserted his fist and began to gnaw on it in a thoughtful manner.</p><p>A small blond boy in homespun breeks leaned on Jamie\u2019s knee, staring up at me in wonder. \u201cWho\u2019s that, Nunkie?\u201d he asked in a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your great-auntie Claire,\u201d Jamie said gravely. \u201cYe\u2019ll have heard about her, I expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d the little boy said, nodding madly. \u201cIs she as old as Grannie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven older,\u201d Jamie said, nodding back solemnly. The lad gawked up at me for a moment, then turned back to Jamie, face screwed up in scorn.</p><p>\u201cGet on wi\u2019 ye, Nunkie! She doesna look anything like as old as Grannie! Why, there\u2019s scarce a bit o\u2019 silver in her hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, child,\u201d I said, beaming at him.</p><p>\u201cAre ye sure that\u2019s our great-auntie Claire?\u201d the boy went on, looking doubtfully at me. \u201cMam says Great-Auntie Claire was maybe a witch, but this lady doesna look much like it. She hasna got a single wart on her nose that I can see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said again, a little more dryly. \u201cAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>He turned suddenly shy at being thus directly addressed, and buried his head in Jamie\u2019s sleeve, refusing to speak.</p><p>\u201cThis is Angus Walter Edwin Murray Carmichael,\u201d Jamie answered for him, ruffling the silky blond hair. \u201cMaggie\u2019s eldest son, and most commonly known as Wally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe call him Snot-rag,\u201d a small red-haired girl standing by my knee informed me. \u201c\u2019Cause his neb is always clotted wi\u2019 gook.\u201d</p><p>Angus Walter jerked his face out of his uncle\u2019s shirt and glared at his female relation, his features beet-red with fury.</p><p>\u201cIs not!\u201d he shouted. \u201cTake it back!\u201d Not waiting to see whether she would or not, he flung himself at her, fists clenched, but was jerked off his feet by his great-uncle\u2019s hand, attached to his collar.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna hit girls,\u201d Jamie informed him firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not manly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she said I was snotty!\u201d Angus Walter wailed. \u201cI must hit her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s no verra civil to pass remarks about someone\u2019s personal appearance, Mistress Abigail,\u201d Jamie said severely to the little girl. \u201cYe should apologize to your cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, but he is...\u201d Abigail persisted, but then caught Jamie\u2019s stern eyes and dropped her own, flushing scarlet. \u201cSorry, Wally,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Wally seemed at first indisposed to consider this adequate compensation for the insult he had suffered, but was at last prevailed upon to cease trying to hit his cousin by his uncle promising him a story.</p><p>\u201cTell the one about the kelpie and the horseman!\u201d my red-haired acquaintance exclaimed, pushing forward to be in on it.</p><p>\u201cNo, the one about the Devil\u2019s chess game!\u201d chimed in one of the other children. Jamie seemed to be a sort of magnet for them; two boys were plucking at his coverlet, while a tiny brown-haired girl had climbed up onto the sofa back by his head, and begun intently plaiting strands of his hair.</p><p>\u201cPretty, Nunkie,\u201d she murmured, taking no part in the hail of suggestions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Wally\u2019s story,\u201d Jamie said firmly, quelling the incipient riot with a gesture. \u201cHe can choose as he likes.\u201d He drew a clean handkerchief out from under the pillow and held it to Wally\u2019s nose, which was in fact rather unsightly.</p><p>\u201cBlow,\u201d he said in an undertone, and then, louder, \u201cand then tell me which you\u2019ll have, Wally.\u201d</p><p>Wally snuffled obligingly, then said, \u201cSt. Bride and the geese, please, Nunkie.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes sought me, resting on my face with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, after a pause. \u201cWell, then. Ye\u2019ll ken that the greylag mate for life? If ye kill a grown goose, hunting, ye must always wait, for the mate will come to mourn. Then ye must try to kill the second, too, for otherwise it will grieve itself to death, calling through the skies for the lost one.\u201d</p><p>Little Benjamin shifted in his wrappings, squirming in my arms. Jamie smiled and shifted his attention back to Wally, hanging open-mouthed on his great-uncle\u2019s knee.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cit was a time, more hundreds of years past than you could ken or dream of, that Bride first set foot on the stone of the Highlands, along with Michael the Blessed...\u201d</p><p>Benjamin let out a small squawk at this point, and began to rootle at the front of my dress. Young Jamie and his siblings seemed to have disappeared, and after a moment\u2019s patting and joggling had proved vain, I left the room in search of Benjamin\u2019s mother, leaving the story in progress behind me.</p><p>I found the lady in question in the kitchen, embedded in a large company of girls and women, and after turning Benjamin over to her, spent some time in introductions, greeting, and the sort of ritual by which women appraise each other, openly and otherwise.</p><p>The women were all very friendly; evidently everyone knew or had been told who I was, for while they introduced me from one to another, there was no apparent surprise at the return of Jamie\u2019s first wife\u2014either from the dead or from France, depending on what they\u2019d been told.</p><p>Still, there were very odd undercurrents passing through the gathering. They scrupulously avoided asking me questions; in another place, this might be mere politeness, but not in the Highlands, where any stranger\u2019s life history was customarily extracted in the course of a casual visit.</p><p>And while they treated me with great courtesy and kindness, there were small looks from the corner of the eye, the passing of glances exchanged behind my back, and casual remarks made quietly in Gaelic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But strangest of all was Jenny\u2019s absence. She was the hearthfire of Lallybroch; I had never been in the house when it was not suffused with her presence, all the inhabitants in orbit about her like planets about the sun. I could think of nothing less like her than that she should leave her kitchen with such a mob of company in the house.</p><p>Her presence was as strong now as the perfume of the fresh pine boughs that lay in a large pile in the back pantry, their presence beginning to scent the house; but of Jenny herself, not a hair was to be seen.</p><p>She had avoided me since the night of my return with Young Ian\u2014natural enough, I supposed, under the circumstances. Neither had I sought an interview with her. Both of us knew there was a reckoning to be made, but neither of us would seek it then.</p><p>It was warm and cozy in the kitchen\u2014too warm. The intermingled scents of drying cloth, hot starch, wet diapers, sweating bodies, oatcake frying in lard, and bread baking were becoming a bit too heady, and when Katherine mentioned the need of a pitcher of cream for the scones, I seized the opportunity to escape, volunteering to fetch it down from the dairy shed.</p> <p>After the press of heated bodies in the kitchen, the cold, damp air outside was so refreshing that I stood still for a minute, shaking the kitchen smells out of my petticoats and hair before making my way to the dairy shed. This shed was some distance away from the main house, convenient to the milking shed, which in turn was built to adjoin the two small paddocks in which sheep and goats were kept. Cattle were kept in the Highlands, but normally for beef, rather than milk, cow\u2019s milk being thought suitable only for invalids.</p><p>To my surprise, as I came out of the dairy shed, I saw Fergus leaning on the paddock fence, staring moodily at the mass of milling wooly backs below. I had not expected to see him here, and wondered whether Jamie knew he had returned.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s prized Merino sheep\u2014imported, hand-fed and a great deal more spoilt than any of her grandchildren\u2014spotted me as I passed, and rushed en masse for the side of their pen, blatting frenziedly in hope of tidbits. Fergus looked up, startled at the racket, then waved halfheartedly. He called something, but it was impossible to hear him over the uproar.</p><p>There was a large bin of frost-blasted cabbage heads near the pen; I pulled out a large, limp green head, and doled out leaves to a dozen or so pairs of eagerly grasping lips, in hopes of shutting them up.</p><p>The ram, a huge wooly creature named Hughie, with testicles that hung nearly to the ground like wool-covered footballs, shouldered his massive way into the front rank with a loud and autocratic Bahh! Fergus, who had reached my side by this time, picked up a whole cabbage and hurled it at Hughie with considerable force and fair accuracy.</p> <p>\u201cTais-toi!\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>Hughie shied and let out an astonished, high-pitched Beh! as the cabbage bounced off his padded back. Then, shaking himself back into some semblance of dignity, he trotted off, testes swinging with offended majesty. His flock, sheeplike, trailed after him, uttering a low chorus of discontented bahs in his wake.</p><p>Fergus glowered malevolently after them.</p><p>\u201cUseless, noisy, smelly beasts,\u201d he said. Rather ungratefully, I thought, given that the scarf and stockings he was wearing had almost certainly been woven from their wool.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Fergus,\u201d I said, ignoring his mood. \u201cDoes Jamie know you\u2019re back yet?\u201d I wondered just how much Fergus knew of recent events, if he had just arrived at Lallybroch.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rather listlessly. \u201cI suppose I should tell him I am here.\u201d In spite of this, he made no move toward the house, but continued staring into the churned mud of the paddock. Something was obviously eating at him; I hoped nothing had gone wrong with his errand.</p> <p>\u201cDid you find Mr. Gage all right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked blank for a moment, then a spark of animation came back into his lean face.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Milord was right; I went with Gage to warn the other members of the Society, and then we went together to the tavern where they were to meet. Sure enough, there was a nest of Customs men there waiting, disguised. And may they be waiting as long as their fellow in the cask, ha ha!\u201d</p><p>The gleam of savage amusement died out of his eyes then, and he sighed.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot expect to be paid for the pamphlets, of course. And even though the press was saved, God knows how long it may be until milord\u2019s business is reestablished.\u201d</p><p>He spoke with such mournfulness that I was surprised.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t help with the printing business, do you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He raised one shoulder and let it fall. \u201cNot to say help, milady. But milord was kind enough to allow me to invest a part of my share of the profits from the brandy in the printing business. In time, I should have become a full partner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said sympathetically. \u201cDo you need money? Perhaps I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shot me a glance of surprise, and then a smile that displayed his perfect, square white teeth.</p><p>\u201cThank you, milady, but no. I myself need very little, and I have enough.\u201d He patted the side pocket of his coat, which jingled reassuringly.</p><p>He paused, frowning, and thrust both wrists deep into the pockets of his coat.</p><p>\u201cNoo...\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIt is only\u2014well, the printing business is most respectable, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d I said, slightly puzzled. He caught my tone and smiled, rather grimly.</p><p>\u201cThe difficulty, milady, is that while a smuggler may be in possession of an income more than sufficient for the support of a wife, smuggling as a sole profession is not likely to appeal to the parents of a respectable young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOho,\u201d I said, everything becoming clear. \u201cYou want to get married? To a respectable young lady?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, a little shyly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Madame. But her mother does not favor me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say I blamed the young lady\u2019s mother, all things considered. While Fergus was possessed of dark good looks and a dashing manner that might well win a young girl\u2019s heart, he lacked a few of the things that might appeal somewhat more to conservative Scottish parents, such as property, income, a left hand, and a last name.</p><p>Likewise, while smuggling, cattle-lifting, and other forms of practical communism had a long and illustrious history in the Highlands, the French did not. And no matter how long Fergus himself had lived at Lallybroch, he remained as French as Notre Dame. He would, like me, always be an outlander.</p><p>\u201cIf I were a partner in a profitable printing firm, you see, perhaps the good lady might be induced to consider my suit,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut as it is...\u201d He shook his head disconsolately.</p><p>I patted his arm sympathetically. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll think of something. Does Jamie know about this girl? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be willing to speak to her mother for you.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, he looked quite alarmed.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, milady! Please, say nothing to him\u2014he has a great many things of more importance to think of just now.\u201d</p><p>On the whole, I thought this was probably true, but I was surprised at his vehemence. Still, I agreed to say nothing to Jamie. My feet were growing chilly from standing in the frozen mud, and I suggested that we go inside.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a little later, milady,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now, I believe I am not suitable company even for sheep.\u201d With a heavy sigh, he turned and trudged off toward the dovecote, shoulders slumped.</p><p>To my surprise, Jenny was in the parlor with Jamie. She had been outside; her cheeks and the end of her long, straight nose were pink with the cold, and the scent of winter mist lingered in her clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent Young Ian to saddle Donas,\u201d she said. She frowned at her brother. \u201cCan ye stand to walk to the barn, Jamie, or had he best bring the beast round for ye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared up at her, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cI can walk wherever it\u2019s needful to go, but I\u2019m no going anywhere just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I not tell ye he\u2019d be coming?\u201d Jenny said impatiently. \u201cAmyas Kettrick stopped by here late last night, and said he\u2019d just come from Kinwallis. Hobart\u2019s meaning to come today, he said.\u201d She glanced at the pretty enameled clock on the mantel. \u201cIf he left after breakfast, he\u2019ll be here within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned at his sister, tilting his head back against the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI told ye, Jenny, I\u2019m no afraid of Hobart MacKenzie,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cDamned if I\u2019ll run from him!\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s brows rose as she looked coldly at her brother.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d she said. \u201cYe weren\u2019t afraid of Laoghaire, either, and look where that got ye!\u201d She jerked her head at the sling on his arm.</p><p>Despite himself, Jamie\u2019s mouth curled up on one side.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s a point,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, Jenny, ye ken guns are scarcer than hen\u2019s teeth in the Highlands. I dinna think Hobart\u2019s going to come and ask to borrow my own pistol to shoot me with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think he\u2019d bother; he\u2019ll just walk in and spit ye through the gizzard like the silly gander ye are!\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Jamie laughed, and she glared at him. I seized the moment to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cWho,\u201d I inquired, \u201cis Hobart MacKenzie, and why exactly does he want to spit you like a gander?\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned his head to me, the light of amusement still in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHobart is Laoghaire\u2019s brother, Sassenach,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs for spitting me or otherwise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaoghaire\u2019s sent for him from Kinwallis, where he lives,\u201d Jenny interrupted, \u201cand told him about...all this.\u201d A slight, impatient gesture encompassed me, Jamie, and the awkward situation in general.</p><p>\u201cThe notion being that Hobart\u2019s meant to come round and expunge the slight upon his sister\u2019s honor by expunging me,\u201d Jamie explained. He seemed to find the idea entertaining. I wasn\u2019t so sure about it, and neither was Jenny.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried about this Hobart?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, a little irritably. He turned to his sister. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jenny, ye ken Hobart MacKenzie! The man couldna stick a pig without cutting off his own foot!\u201d</p><p>She looked him up and down, evidently gauging his ability to defend himself against an incompetent pigsticker, and reluctantly concluding that he might manage, even one-handed.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, and what if he comes for ye and ye kill him, aye? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll be dead, I expect,\u201d Jamie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye\u2019ll be hangit for murder,\u201d she shot back, \u201cor on the run, wi\u2019 all the rest of Laoghaire\u2019s kin after ye. Want to start a blood feud, do ye?\u201d</p><p>Jamie narrowed his eyes at his sister, emphasizing the already marked resemblance between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want,\u201d he said, with exaggerated patience, \u201cis my breakfast. D\u2019ye mean to feed me, or d\u2019ye mean to wait until I faint from hunger, and then hide me in the priest hole \u2019til Hobart leaves?\u201d</p><p>Annoyance struggled with humor on Jenny\u2019s fine-boned face as she glared at her brother. As usual with both Frasers, humor won out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thought,\u201d she said, teeth flashing in a brief, reluctant smile. \u201cIf I could drag your stubborn carcass that far, I\u2019d club ye myself.\u201d She shook her head and sighed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Jamie, ye\u2019ll have it your way. But ye\u2019ll try not to make a mess on my good Turkey carpet, aye?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, long mouth curling up on one side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise, Jenny,\u201d he said. \u201cNay bloodshed in the parlor.\u201d</p> <p>She snorted. \u201cClot,\u201d she said, but without rancor. \u201cI\u2019ll send Janet wi\u2019 your parritch.\u201d And she was gone, in a swirl of skirts and petticoats.</p><p>\u201cDid she say Donas?\u201d I asked, looking after her in bemusement. \u201cSurely it isn\u2019t the same horse you took from Leoch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no.\u201d Jamie tilted his head back, smiling up at me. \u201cThis is Donas\u2019s grandson\u2014or one of them. We give the name to the sorrel colts in his honor.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over the back of the sofa, gently feeling down the length of the injured arm from the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSore?\u201d I asked, seeing him wince as I pressed a few inches above the wound. It was better; the day before, the area of soreness had started higher.</p> <p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he said. He removed the sling and tried gingerly extending the arm, grimacing. \u201cI dinna think I\u2019ll turn handsprings awhile yet, though.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose so.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cJamie\u2014this Hobart. You really don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cAnd if I did, I\u2019d still want my breakfast first. I dinna mean to be killed on an empty stomach.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, somewhat reassured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get it for you,\u201d I promised.</p> <p>As I stepped out into the hall, though, I caught sight of a flutter through one of the windows, and stopped to look. It was Jenny, cloaked and hooded against the cold, headed up the slope to the barn. Seized by a sudden impulse, I snatched a cloak from the hall tree and darted out after her. I had things to say to Jenny Murray, and this might be the best chance of catching her alone.</p><p>I caught up with her just outside the barn; she heard my step behind her and turned, startled. She glanced about quickly, but saw we were alone. Realizing that there was no way of putting off a confrontation, she squared her shoulders under the woolen cloak and lifted her head, meeting my eyes straight on.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d best tell Young Ian to unsaddle the horse,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to the root cellar to fetch up some onions for a tart. Will ye come with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Pulling my cloak tight around me against the winter wind, I followed her into the barn.</p><p>It was warm inside, at least by contrast with the chill outdoors, dark, and filled with the pleasant scent of horses, hay, and manure. I paused a moment to let my eyes adapt to the dimness, but Jenny walked directly down the central aisle, footsteps light on the stone floor.</p><p>Young Ian was sprawled at length on a pile of fresh straw; he sat up, blinking at the sound.</p><p>Jenny glanced from her son to the stall, where a soft-eyed sorrel was peacefully munching hay from its manger, unburdened by saddle or bridle.</p><p>\u201cDid I not tell ye to ready Donas?\u201d she asked the boy, her voice sharp.</p> <p>Young Ian scratched his head, looking a little sheepish, and stood up.</p><p>\u201cAye, mam, ye did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didna think it worth the time to saddle him, only to have to unsaddle him again.\u201d</p><p>Jenny stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what made ye so certain he wouldna be needed?\u201d</p><p>Young Ian shrugged, and smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cMam, ye ken as well as I do that Uncle Jamie wouldna run away from anything, let alone Uncle Hobart. Don\u2019t ye?\u201d he added, gently.</p><p>Jenny looked up at her son and sighed. Then a reluctant smile lighted her face and she reached up, smoothing the thick, untidy hair away from his face.</p><p>\u201cAye, wee Ian. I do.\u201d Her hand lingered along his ruddy cheek, then dropped away.</p><p>\u201cGo along to the house, then, and have second breakfast wi\u2019 your uncle,\u201d she said. \u201cYour auntie and I are goin\u2019 to the root cellar. But ye come and fetch me smartly, if Mr. Hobart MacKenzie should come, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, Mam,\u201d he promised, and shot for the house, impelled by the thought of food.</p><p>Jenny watched him go, moving with the clumsy grace of a young whooping crane, and shook her head, the smile still on her lips.</p><p>\u201cSweet laddie,\u201d she murmured. Then, recalled to the present circumstances, she turned to me with decision.</p><p>\u201cCome along, then,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect ye want to talk to me, aye?\u201d</p><p>Neither of us said anything until we reached the quiet sanctuary of the root cellar. It was a small room dug under the house, pungent with the scent of the long braided strings of onions and garlic that hung from the rafters, the sweet, spicy scent of dried apples, and the moist, earthy smell of potatoes, spread in lumpy brown blankets over the shelves that lined the cellar.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye remember telling me to plant potatoes?\u201d Jenny asked, passing a hand lightly over the clustered tubers. \u201cThat was a lucky thing; \u2019twas the potato crop kept us alive, more than one winter after Culloden.\u201d</p><p>I remembered, all right. I had told her as we stood together on a cold autumn night, about to part\u2014she to return to a newborn baby, I to hunt for Jamie, an outlaw in the Highlands, under sentence of death. I had found him, and saved him\u2014and Lallybroch, evidently. And she had tried to give them both to Laoghaire.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said softly, at last. I spoke to the top of her head, bent over her task. Her hand went out with the regularity of clockwork, pulling an onion from the long hanging braid, breaking the tough, withered stems from the plait and tossing it into the basket she carried.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d I said. I broke off an onion from another braid, but instead of putting it in the basket, held it in my hands, rolling it back and forth like a baseball, hearing the papery skin rustle between my palms.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I do what?\u201d Her voice was perfectly controlled again; only someone who knew her well could have heard the note of strain in it. I knew her well\u2014or had, at one time.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I make the match between my brother and Laoghaire, d\u2019ye mean?\u201d She glanced up quickly, smooth black brows raised in question, but then bent back to the braid of onions. \u201cYou\u2019re right; he wouldna have done it, without I made him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did make him do it,\u201d I said. The wind rattled the door of the root cellar, sending a small sifting of dirt down upon the cut-stone steps.</p><p>\u201cHe was lonely,\u201d she said, softly. \u201cSo lonely. I couldna bear to see him so. He was wretched for so long, ye ken, mourning for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he was dead,\u201d I said quietly, answering the unspoken accusation.</p><p>\u201cHe might as well have been,\u201d she said, sharply, then raised her head and sighed, pushing back a lock of dark hair.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe ye truly didna ken he\u2019d lived; there were a great many who didn\u2019t, after Culloden\u2014and it\u2019s sure he thought you were dead and gone then. But he was sair wounded, and not only his leg. And when he came home from England\u2014\u201d She shook her head, and reached for another onion. \u201cHe was whole enough to look at, but not\u2014\u201d She gave me a look, straight on, with those slanted blue eyes, so disturbingly like her brother\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s no the sort of man should sleep alone, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranted,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cBut we did live, the both of us. Why did you send for Laoghaire when we came back with Young Ian?\u201d</p><p>Jenny didn\u2019t answer at first, but only went on reaching for onions, breaking, reaching, breaking, reaching.</p><p>\u201cI liked you,\u201d she said at last, so low I could barely hear her. \u201cLoved ye, maybe, when ye lived here with Jamie, before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you, too,\u201d I said, just as softly. \u201cThen why?\u201d</p><p>Her hands stilled at last and she looked up at me, fists balled at her sides.</p><p>\u201cWhen Ian told me ye\u2019d come back,\u201d she said slowly, eyes fastened on the onions, \u201cye could have knocked me flat wi\u2019 a down-feather. At first, I was excited, wanting to see ye\u2014wanting to know where ye\u2019d been\u2014\u201d she added, arching her brows slightly in inquiry. I didn\u2019t answer, and she went on.</p><p>\u201cBut then I was afraid,\u201d she said softly. Her eyes slid away, shadowed by their thick fringe of black lashes.</p><p>\u201cI saw ye, ye ken,\u201d she said, still looking off into some unseeable distance. \u201cWhen he wed Laoghaire, and them standing by the altar\u2014ye were there wi\u2019 them, standing at his left hand, betwixt him and Laoghaire. And I kent that meant ye would take him back.\u201d</p><p>The hair prickled slightly on the nape of my neck. She shook her head slowly, and I saw she had gone pale with the memory. She sat down on a barrel, the cloak spreading out around her like a flower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of those born wi\u2019 the Sight, nor one who has it regular. I\u2019ve never had it before, and hope never to have it again. But I saw ye there, as clear as I see ye now, and it scairt me so that I had to leave the room, right in the midst o\u2019 the vows.\u201d She swallowed, looking at me directly.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken who ye are,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOr...or...what. We didna ken your people, or your place. I never asked ye, did I? Jamie chose ye, that was enough. But then ye were gone, and after so long\u2014I thought he might have forgot ye enough to wed again, and be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t, though,\u201d I said, hoping for confirmation from Jenny.</p><p>She gave it, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut Jamie\u2019s a faithful man, aye? No matter how it was between the two of them, him and Laoghaire, if he\u2019d sworn to be her man, he wouldna leave her altogether. It didna matter that he spent most of his time in Edinburgh; I kent he\u2019d always come back here\u2014he\u2019d be bound here, to the Highlands. But then you came back.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lay still in her lap, a rare sight. They were still finely shaped, long-fingered and deft, but the knuckles were red and rough with years of work, and the veins stood out blue beneath the thin white skin.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken,\u201d she said, looking into her lap, \u201cI have never been further than ten miles from Lallybroch, in all my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, slightly startled. She shook her head slowly, then looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou have, though,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve traveled a great deal, I expect.\u201d Her gaze searched my face, looking for clues.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, as though thinking to herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go again,\u201d she said, nearly whispering. \u201cI kent ye would go again. You\u2019re not bound here, not like Laoghaire\u2014not like me. And he would go with ye. And I should never see him again.\u201d She closed her eyes briefly, then opened them, looking at me under her fine dark brows.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought if ye kent about Laoghaire, ye\u2019d go again at once\u2014you did\u2014\u201d she added, with a faint grimace, \u201cand Jamie would stay. But ye came back.\u201d Her shoulders rose in a faint, helpless shrug. \u201cAnd I see it\u2019s no good; he\u2019s bound to ye, for good or ill. It\u2019s you that\u2019s his wife. And if ye leave again, he will go with ye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I searched helplessly for words to reassure her. \u201cBut I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t go again. I only want to stay here with him\u2014always.\u201d</p><p>I laid a hand on her arm and she stiffened slightly. After a moment, she laid her own hand over mine. It was chilled, and the tip of her long, straight nose was red with cold.</p><p>\u201cFolk say different things of the Sight, aye?\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cSome say it\u2019s doomed; whatever ye see that way must come to pass. But others say nay, it\u2019s no but a warning; take heed and ye can change things. What d\u2019ye think, yourself?\u201d She looked sideways at me, curiously.</p> <p>I took a deep breath, the smell of onions stinging the back of my nose. This was hitting home in no uncertain terms.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, and my voice shook slightly. \u201cI\u2019d always thought that of course you could change things if you knew about them. But now...I don\u2019t know,\u201d I ended softly, thinking of Culloden.</p><p>Jenny watched me, her eyes so deep a blue as almost to be black in the dim light. I wondered again just how much Jamie had told her\u2014and how much she knew without the telling.</p><p>\u201cBut ye must try, even so,\u201d she said, with certainty. \u201cYe couldna just leave it, could ye?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether she meant this personally, but I shook my head.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t. You\u2019re right; you have to try.\u201d</p><p>We smiled at each other, a little shyly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take good care of him?\u201d Jenny said suddenly. \u201cEven if ye go? Ye will, aye?\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her cold fingers, feeling the bones of her hand light and fragile-seeming in my grasp.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s all right,\u201d she said softly, and squeezed back.</p> <p>We sat for a moment, holding each other\u2019s hands, until the door of the root cellar swung open, admitting a blast of rain and wind down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMam?\u201d Young Ian\u2019s head poked in, eyes bright with excitement. \u201cHobart MacKenzie\u2019s come! Da says to come quick!\u201d</p><p>Jenny sprang to her feet, barely remembering to snatch up the basket of onions.</p><p>\u201cHas he come armed, then?\u201d she asked anxiously. \u201cHas he brought a pistol or a sword?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head, his dark hair lifting wildly in the wind.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Mam!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse. He\u2019s brought a lawyer!\u201d</p><p>Anything less resembling vengeance incarnate than Hobart MacKenzie could scarcely be imagined. A small, light-boned man of about thirty, he had pale blue, pale-lashed eyes with a tendency to water, and indeterminate features that began with a receding hairline and dwindled down into a similarly receding chin that seemed to be trying to escape into the folds of his stock.</p><p>He was smoothing his hair at the mirror in the hall when we came in the front door, a neatly curled bob wig sitting on the table beside him. He blinked at us in alarm, then snatched up the wig and crammed it on his head, bowing in the same motion.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Jenny,\u201d he said. His small, rabbity eyes flicked in my direction, away, then back again, as though he hoped I really wasn\u2019t there, but was very much afraid I was.</p><p>Jenny glanced from him to me, sighed deeply, and took the bull by the horns.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie,\u201d she said, dropping him a formal curtsy. \u201cMight I present my good-sister, Claire? Claire, Mr. Hobart MacKenzie of Kinwallis.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open and he simply gawked at me. I started to extend a hand to him, but thought better of it. I would have liked to know what Emily Post had to recommend in a situation like this, but as Miss Post wasn\u2019t present, I was forced to improvise.</p><p>\u201cHow nice to meet you,\u201d I said, smiling as cordially as possible.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d he said. He bobbed his head tentatively at me. \u201cUm...your...servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, at this point in the proceedings, the door to the parlor opened. I looked at the small, neat figure framed in the doorway, and let out a cry of delighted recognition.</p><p>\u201cNed! Ned Gowan!\u201d</p><p>It was indeed Ned Gowan, the elderly Edinburgh lawyer who had once saved me from burning as a witch. He was noticeably more elderly now, shrunken with age and so heavily wrinkled as to look like one of the dried apples I had seen in the root cellar.</p><p>The bright black eyes were the same, though, and they fastened on me at once with an expression of joy.</p><p>\u201cMy dear!\u201d he exclaimed, hastening forward at a rapid hobble. He seized my hand, beaming, and pressed it to his withered lips in fervent gallantry.</p><p>\u201cI had heard that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you come to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014so delightful to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014so happy to see you again, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>A cough from Hobart MacKenzie interrupted this rapturous exchange, and Mr. Gowan looked up, startled, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, of course. Business first, my dear,\u201d he said, with a gallant bow to me, \u201cand then if ye will, I should be most charmed to hear the tale of your adventures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I said, wondering just how much he would insist on hearing.</p><p>\u201cSplendid, splendid.\u201d He glanced about the hall, bright little eyes taking in Hobart and Jenny, who had hung up her cloak and was smoothing her hair. \u201cMr. Fraser and Mr. Murray are already in the parlor. Mr. MacKenzie, if you and the ladies would consent to join us, perhaps we can settle your affairs expeditiously, and proceed to more congenial matters. If you will allow me, my dear?\u201d He crooked a bony arm to me invitingly.</p><p>Jamie was still on the sofa where I had left him, and in approximately the same condition\u2014that is, alive. The children were gone, with the exception of one chubby youngster who was curled up on Jamie\u2019s lap, fast asleep. Jamie\u2019s hair now sported several small plaits on either side, with silk ribbons woven gaily through them, which gave him an incongruously festive air.</p><p>\u201cYou look like the Cowardly Lion of Oz,\u201d I told him in an undertone, sitting down on a hassock behind his sofa. I didn\u2019t think it likely that Hobart MacKenzie intended any outright mischief, but if anything happened, I meant to be in close reach of Jamie.</p><p>He looked startled, and put a hand to his head.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><p>The other participants had now arranged themselves around the parlor, Jenny sitting down by Ian on the other love seat, and Hobart and Mr. Gowan taking two velvet chairs.</p><p>\u201cWe are assembled?\u201d Mr. Gowan inquired, glancing around the room. \u201cAll interested parties are present? Excellent. Well, to begin with, I must declare my own interest. I am here in the capacity of solicitor to Mr. Hobart MacKenzie, representing the interests of Mrs. James Fraser\u201d\u2014 he saw me start, and added, with precision\u2014\u201cthat is, the second Mrs. James Fraser, n\u00e9e Laoghaire MacKenzie. That is understood?\u201d</p><p>He glanced inquiringly at Jamie, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Mr. Gowan picked up a glass from the table next to him and took a tiny sip. \u201cMy clients, the MacKenzies, have accepted my proposal to seek a legal solution to the imbroglio which I understand has resulted from the sudden and unexpected\u2014though of course altogether happy and fortuitous\u2014\u201d he added, with a bow to me, \u201creturn of the first Mrs. Fraser.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head reprovingly at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou, my dear young man, have contrived to entangle yourself in considerable legal difficulties, I am sorry to say.\u201d</p><p>Jamie raised one eyebrow and looked at his sister.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I had help,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cJust what difficulties are we speakin\u2019 of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to begin with,\u201d Ned Gowan said cheerily, his sparkling black eyes sinking into nets of wrinkles as he smiled at me, \u201cthe first Mrs. Fraser would be well within her rights to bring a civil suit against ye for adultery, and criminal fornication, forbye. Penalties for which include\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced back at me, with a quick blue gleam.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m no so worrit by that possibility,\u201d he told the lawyer. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>Ned Gowan nodded obligingly and held up one withered hand, folding down the fingers as he ticked off his points.</p><p>\u201cWith respect to the second Mrs. Fraser\u2014n\u00e9e Laoghaire MacKenzie\u2014ye could, of course, be charged wi\u2019 bigamous misconduct, intent to defraud, actual fraud committed\u2014whether wi\u2019 intent or no, which is a separate question\u2014felonious misrepresentation\u201d\u2014he happily folded down his fourth finger and drew breath for more\u2014\u201cand...\u201d</p><p>Jamie had been listening patiently to this catalogue. Now he interrupted, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cNed,\u201d he said gently, \u201cwhat the hell does the bloody woman want?\u201d</p><p>The small lawyer blinked behind his spectacles, lowered his hand, and cast up his eyes to the beams overhead.</p><p>\u201cWeel, the lady\u2019s chief desire as stated,\u201d he said circumspectly, \u201cis to see ye castrated and disemboweled in the market square at Broch Mordha, and your head mounted on a stake over her gate.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s shoulders vibrated briefly, and he winced as the movement jarred his arm.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, his mouth twitching.</p><p>A smile gathered up the wrinkles by Ned\u2019s ancient mouth.</p><p>\u201cI was obliged to inform Mrs.\u2014that is, the lady\u2014\u201d he amended, with a glance at me and a slight cough, \u201cthat her remedies under the law were somewhat more limited than would accommodate her desires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cBut I assume the general idea is that she doesna particularly want me back as a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hobart put in unexpectedly. \u201cCrow\u2019s bait, maybe, but not a husband.\u201d</p><p>Ned cast a cold glance at his client.</p><p>\u201cYe willna compromise your case by admitting things in advance of settlement, aye?\u201d he said reprovingly. \u201cOr what are ye payin\u2019 me for?\u201d He turned back to Jamie, professional dignity unimpaired.</p><p>\u201cWhile Miss MacKenzie does not wish to resume a marital position wi\u2019 regard to you\u2014an action which would be impossible in any case,\u201d he added fairly, \u201cunless ye should wish to divorce the present Mrs. Fraser, and remarry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna want to do that,\u201d Jamie assured him hurriedly, with another glance at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, in such case,\u201d Ned went on, unruffled, \u201cI should advise my clients that it is more desirable where possible to avoid the cost\u2014and the publicity\u2014\u201d he added, cocking an invisible eyebrow in admonition to Hobart, who nodded hastily, \u201cof a suit at law, with a public trial and its consequent exposure of facts. That being the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Jamie interrupted.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d Ned Gowan looked shocked. \u201cI havena mentioned anything in the nature of a pecuniary settlement as yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because ye\u2019re too busy enjoying yourself, ye wicked auld rascal,\u201d Jamie said. He was irritated\u2014a red patch burned over each cheekbone\u2014but amused, too. \u201cGet to it, aye?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ned Gowan inclined his head ceremoniously.</p><p>\u201cWeel, ye must understand,\u201d he began, \u201cthat a successful suit brought under the charges as described might result in Miss MacKenzie and her brother mulcting ye in substantial damages\u2014verra substantial indeed,\u201d he added, with a faint lawyerly gloating at the prospect.</p><p>\u201cAfter all, Miss MacKenzie has not only been subject to public humiliation and ridicule leading to acute distress of mind, but is also threatened with loss of her chief means of support\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isna threatened wi\u2019 any such thing,\u201d Jamie interrupted heatedly. \u201cI told her I should go on supporting her and the two lassies! What does she think I am?\u201d</p> <p>Ned exchanged a glance with Hobart, who shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna want to know what she thinks ye are,\u201d Hobart assured Jamie. \u201cI wouldna have thought she kent such words, myself. But ye do mean to pay?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded impatiently, rubbing his good hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cAye, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly until she\u2019s marrit again, though.\u201d Everyone\u2019s head turned in surprise toward Jenny, who nodded firmly to Ned Gowan.</p> <p>\u201cIf Jamie\u2019s married to Claire, the marriage between him and Laoghaire wasna valid, aye?\u201d</p><p>The lawyer bowed.</p><p>\u201cThat is true, Mrs. Murray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Jenny said, in a decided manner. \u201cShe\u2019s free to marry again at once, is she no? And once she does, my brother shouldna be providing for her household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent point, Mrs. Murray.\u201d Ned Gowan took up his quill and scratched industriously. \u201cWell, we make progress,\u201d he declared, laying it down again and beaming at the company. \u201cNow, the next point to be covered...\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the decanter of whisky was empty, the sheets of foolscap on the table were filled with Ned Gowan\u2019s chicken-scratchings, and everyone lay limp and exhausted\u2014except Ned himself, spry and bright-eyed as ever.</p> <p>\u201cExcellent, excellent,\u201d he declared again, gathering up the sheets and tapping them neatly into order. \u201cSo\u2014the main provisions of the settlement are as follows: Mr. Fraser agrees to pay to Miss MacKenzie the sum of five hundred pounds in compensation for distress, inconvenience, and the loss of his conjugal services\u201d\u2014Jamie snorted slightly at this, but Ned affected not to hear him, continuing his synopsis\u2014\u201cand in addition, agrees to maintain her household at the rate of one hundred pounds per annum, until such time as the aforesaid Miss MacKenzie may marry again, at which time such payment shall cease. Mr. Fraser agrees also to provide a bride-portion for each of Miss MacKenzie\u2019s daughters, of an additional three hundred pounds, and as a final provision, agrees not to pursue a prosecution against Miss MacKenzie for assault with intent to commit murder. In return, Miss MacKenzie acquits Mr. Fraser of any and all other claims. This is in accordance with your understanding and consent, Mr. Fraser?\u201d He quirked a brow at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is,\u201d Jamie said. He was pale from sitting up too long, and there was a fine dew of sweat at his hairline, but he sat straight and tall, the child still asleep in his lap, thumb firmly embedded in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Ned said again. He rose, beaming, and bowed to the company. \u201cAs our friend Dr. John Arbuthnot says, \u2018Law is a bottomless pit.\u2019 But not more so at the moment than my stomach. Is that delectable aroma indicative of a saddle of mutton in our vicinity, Mrs. Jenny?\u201d</p><p>At table, I sat to one side of Jamie, Hobart MacKenzie to the other, now looking pink and relaxed. Mary MacNab brought in the joint, and by ancient custom, set it down in front of Jamie. Her gaze lingered on him a moment too long. He picked up the long, wicked carving knife with his good hand and offered it politely to Hobart.</p><p>\u201cWill ye have a go at it, Hobart?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOch, no,\u201d Hobart said, waving it away. \u201cBetter let your wife carve it. I\u2019m no hand wi\u2019 a knife\u2014likely cut my finger off instead. You know me, Jamie,\u201d he said comfortably.</p><p>Jamie gave his erstwhile brother-in-law a long look over the saltcellar.</p><p>\u201cOnce I would ha\u2019 thought, so, Hobart,\u201d he said. \u201cPass me the whisky, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe thing to do is to get her married at once,\u201d Jenny declared. The children and grandchildren had all retired, and Ned and Hobart had departed for Kinwallis, leaving the four of us to take stock over brandy and cream cakes in the laird\u2019s study.</p><p>Jamie turned to his sister. \u201cThe matchmaking\u2019s more in your line, aye?\u201d he said, with a noticeable edge to his voice. \u201cI expect you can think of a suitable man or two for the job, if ye put your mind to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect I can,\u201d she said, matching his edge with one of her own. She was embroidering; the needle stabbed through the linen fabric, flashing in the lamplight. It had begun to sleet heavily outside, but the study was cozy, with a small fire on the hearth and the pool of lamplight spilling warmth over the battered desk and its burden of books and ledgers.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the one thing about it,\u201d she said, eyes on her work. \u201cWhere d\u2019ye mean to get twelve hundred pounds, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>I had been wondering that myself. The insurance settlement on the printshop had fallen far short of that amount, and I doubted that Jamie\u2019s share of the smuggling proceeds amounted to anything near that magnitude. Certainly Lallybroch itself could not supply the money; survival in the Highlands was a chancy business, and even several good years in a row would provide only the barest surplus.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s only the one place, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Ian looked from his sister to his brother-in-law and back. After a short silence, Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d he said reluctantly. He glanced at the window, where the rain was slashing across the glass in slanting streaks. \u201cA vicious time of year for it, though.\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged, and sat forward a bit in his chair. \u201cThe spring tide will be in a week.\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned, looking troubled.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one has a better right to it, Jamie,\u201d Ian said. He reached out and squeezed his friend\u2019s good arm, smiling. \u201cIt was meant for Prince Charles\u2019 followers, aye? And ye were one of those, whether ye wanted to be or no.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave him back a rueful half-smile.</p><p>\u201cAye, I suppose that\u2019s true.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIn any case, it\u2019s the only thing I can see to do.\u201d He glanced back and forth between Ian and Jenny, evidently debating whether to add something else. His sister knew him even better than I did. She lifted her head from her work and looked at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jamie?\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI want to take Young Ian,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said instantly. The needle had stopped, stuck halfway through a brilliant red bud in the pattern, the color of blood against the white smock.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old enough, Jenny,\u201d Jamie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not!\u201d she objected. \u201cHe\u2019s but barely fifteen; Michael and Jamie were both sixteen at least, and better grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but wee Ian\u2019s a better swimmer than either of his brothers,\u201d Ian said judiciously. His forehead was furrowed with thought. \u201cIt will have to be one of the lads, after all,\u201d he pointed out to Jenny. He jerked his head toward Jamie, cradling his arm in its sling. \u201cJamie canna very well be swimming himself, in his present condition. Or Claire, for that matter,\u201d he added, with a smile at me.</p><p>\u201cSwim?\u201d I said, utterly bewildered. \u201cSwim where?\u201d</p><p>Ian looked taken aback for a moment; then he glanced at Jamie, brows lifted.</p><p>\u201cOh. Ye hadna told her?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head. \u201cI had, but not all of it.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cIt\u2019s the treasure, Sassenach\u2014the seals\u2019 gold.\u201d</p><p>Unable to take the treasure with him, he had concealed it in its place and returned to Ardsmuir.</p><p>\u201cI didna ken what best to do about it,\u201d he explained. \u201cDuncan Kerr gave the care of it to me, but I had no notion who it belonged to, or who put it there, or what I was to do with it. \u2018The white witch\u2019 was all Duncan said, and that meant nothing to me but you, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Reluctant to make use of the treasure himself, and yet feeling that someone should know about it, lest he die in prison, he had sent a carefully coded letter to Jenny and Ian at Lallybroch, giving the location of the cache, and the use for which it had\u2014presumably\u2014been meant.</p><p>Times had been hard for Jacobites then, sometimes even more so for those who had escaped to France\u2014leaving lands and fortunes behind\u2014than for those who remained to face English persecution in the Highlands. At about the same time, Lallybroch had experienced two bad crops in a row, and letters had reached them from France, asking for any help possible to succor erstwhile companions there, in danger of starvation.</p><p>\u201cWe had nothing to send; in fact, we were damn close to starving here,\u201d Ian explained. \u201cI sent word to Jamie, and he said as he thought perhaps it wouldna be wrong to use a small bit of the treasure to help feed Prince Tearlach\u2019s followers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed likely it was put there by one of the Stuarts\u2019 supporters,\u201d Jamie chimed in. He cocked a ruddy brow at me, and his mouth quirked up at one corner. \u201cI thought I wouldna send it to Prince Charles, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thinking,\u201d I said dryly. Any money given to Charles Stuart would have been wasted, squandered within weeks, and anyone who had known Charles intimately, as Jamie had, would know that very well.</p><p>Ian had taken his eldest son, Jamie, and made his way across Scotland to the seals\u2019 cove near Coigach. Fearful of any word of the treasure getting out, they had not sought a fisherman\u2019s boat, but instead Young Jamie had swum to the seals\u2019 rock as his uncle had several years before. He had found the treasure in its place, abstracted two gold coins and three of the smaller gemstones, and secreting these in a bag tied securely round his neck, had replaced the rest of the treasure and made his way back through the surf, arriving exhausted.</p><p>They had made their way to Inverness then, and taken ship to France, where their cousin Jared Fraser, a successful expatriate wine merchant, had helped them to change the coins and jewels discreetly into cash, and taken the responsibility of distributing it among the Jacobites in need.</p><p>Three times since, Ian had made the laborious trip to the coast with one of his sons, each time to abstract a small part of the hidden fortune to supply a need. Twice the money had gone to friends in need in France; once it had been needed to purchase fresh planting-stock for Lallybroch and provide the food to see its tenants through a long winter when the potato crop failed.</p><p>Only Jenny, Ian, and the two elder boys, Jamie and Michael, knew of the treasure. Ian\u2019s wooden leg prevented his swimming to the seals\u2019 island, so one of his sons must always make the trip with him. I gathered that it had been something of a rite of passage for both Young Jamie and Michael, entrusted with such a great secret. Now it might be Young Ian\u2019s turn.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jenny said again, but I thought her heart wasn\u2019t in it. Ian was already nodding thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWould ye take him with ye to France, too, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s the thing. I shall have to leave Lallybroch, and stay away for a good bit, for Laoghaire\u2019s sake\u2014I canna be living here with you, under her nose,\u201d he said apologetically to me, \u201cat least not until she\u2019s suitably wed to someone else.\u201d He switched his attention back to Ian.</p> <p>\u201cI havena told ye everything that\u2019s happened in Edinburgh, Ian, but all things considered, I think it likely best I stay away from there for a time, too.\u201d</p><p>I sat quiet, trying to digest this news. I hadn\u2019t realized that Jamie meant to leave Lallybroch\u2014leave Scotland altogether, it sounded like.</p><p>\u201cSo what d\u2019ye mean to do, Jamie?\u201d Jenny had given up any pretense of sewing, and sat with her hands in her lap.</p><p>He rubbed his nose, looking tired. This was the first day he had been up; I privately thought he should have been back in bed hours ago, but he had insisted upon staying up to preside over dinner and visit with everyone.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cJared\u2019s offered more than once to take me into his firm. Perhaps I shall stay in France, at least for a year. I was thinking Young Ian could go with us, and be schooled in Paris.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny and Ian exchanged a long look, one of those in which long-married couples are capable of carrying out complete conversations in the space of a few heartbeats. At last, Jenny tilted her head a bit to one side. Ian smiled and took her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, mo nighean dubh,\u201d he said to her in a low, tender voice. Then he turned to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cAye, take him. It\u2019ll be a great chance for the lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Jamie hesitated, speaking to his sister, rather than Ian. Jenny nodded. Her blue eyes glistened in the lamplight, and the end of her nose was slightly red.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s best we give him his freedom while he still thinks it\u2019s ours to give,\u201d she said. She looked at Jamie, then at me, straight and steady. \u201cBut you\u2019ll take good care of him, aye?\u201d</p><p>39</p> <p>LOST, AND BY THE WIND GRIEVED</p><p>This part of Scotland was as unlike the leafy glens and lochs near Lallybroch as the North Yorkshire moors. Here there were virtually no trees; only long sweeps of rock-strewn heather, rising into crags that touched the lowering sky and disappeared abruptly into curtains of mist.</p><p>As we got nearer to the seacoast, the mist became heavier, setting in earlier in the afternoon, lingering longer in the morning, so that only for a couple of hours in the middle of the day did we have anything like clear riding. The going was consequently slow, but none of us minded greatly, except Young Ian, who was beside himself with excitement, impatient to arrive.</p><p>\u201cHow far is it from the shore to the seals\u2019 island?\u201d he asked Jamie for the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cA quarter mile, I make it,\u201d his uncle replied.</p><p>\u201cI can swim that far,\u201d Young Ian repeated, for the tenth time. His hands were clenched tightly on the reins, and his bony jaw set with determination.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know ye can,\u201d Jamie assured him patiently. He glanced at me, the hint of a smile hidden in the corner of his mouth. \u201cYe willna need to, though; just swim straight for the island, and the current will carry ye.\u201d</p><p>The boy nodded, and lapsed into silence, but his eyes were bright with anticipation.</p> <p>The headland above the cove was mist-shrouded and deserted. Our voices echoed oddly in the fog, and we soon stopped talking, out of an abiding sense of eeriness. I could hear the seals barking far below, the sound wavering and mixing with the crash of the surf, so that now and then it sounded like sailors hallooing to one another over the sound of the sea.</p><p>Jamie pointed out the rock chimney of Ellen\u2019s tower to Young Ian, and taking a coil of rope from his saddle, picked his way over the broken rock of the headland to the entrance.</p><p>\u201cKeep your shirt on \u2019til you\u2019re down,\u201d he told the lad, shouting to be heard above the wave. \u201cElse the rock will tear your back to shreds.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded understanding, then, the rope tied securely round his middle, gave me a nervous grin, took two jerky steps, and disappeared into the earth.</p><p>Jamie had the other end of the rope wrapped round his own waist, paying out the length of it carefully with his sound hand as the boy descended. Crawling on hands and knees, I made my way over the short turf and pebbles to the crumbling edge of the cliff, where I could look over to the half-moon beach below.</p><p>It seemed a very long time, but finally I saw Ian emerge from the bottom of the chimney, a small, antlike figure. He untied his rope, peered around, spotted us at the top of the cliff, and waved enthusiastically. I waved back, but Jamie merely muttered, \u201cAll right, get on, then,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>I could feel him tense beside me as the boy stripped off to his breeks and scrambled down the rocks to the water, and I felt his flinch as the small figure dived headlong into the gray-blue waves.</p><p>\u201cBrrr!\u201d I said, watching. \u201cThe water must be freezing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Jamie said with feeling. \u201cIan\u2019s right; it\u2019s a vicious time of year to be swimming.\u201d</p><p>His face was pale and set. I didn\u2019t think it was the result of discomfort from his wounded arm, though the long ride and the exercise with the rope couldn\u2019t have done it any good. While he had shown nothing but encouraging confidence while Ian was making his descent, he wasn\u2019t making any effort to hide his worry now. The fact was that there was no way for us to reach Ian, should anything go wrong.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have waited for the mist to lift,\u201d I said, more to distract him than because I thought so.</p><p>\u201cIf we had \u2019til next Easter, we might,\u201d he agreed ironically. \u201cThough I\u2019ll grant ye, I\u2019ve seen it clearer than this,\u201d he added, squinting into the swirling murk below.</p><p>The three islands were only intermittently visible from the cliff as the fog swept across them. I had been able to see the bobbing dot of Ian\u2019s head for the first twenty yards as he left the shore, but now he had disappeared into the mist.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s all right?\u201d Jamie bent to help me scramble upright. The cloth of his coat was damp and rough under my fingers, soaked with mist and the fine droplets of ocean spray.</p><p>\u201cAye, he\u2019ll do. He\u2019s a bonny swimmer; and it\u2019s none so difficult a swim, either, once he\u2019s into the current.\u201d Still, he stared into the mist as though sheer effort could pierce its veils.</p><p>On Jamie\u2019s advice, Young Ian had timed his descent to begin when the tide began to go out, so as to have as much assistance as possible from the tide-race. Looking over the edge, I could see a floating mass of bladder wrack, half-stranded on the widening strip of beach.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps two hours before he comes back.\u201d Jamie answered my unspoken question. He turned reluctantly from his vain perusal of the mist-hidden cove. \u201cDamn, I wish I\u2019d gone myself, arm or no arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth Young Jamie and Michael have done it,\u201d I reminded him. He gave me a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. Ian will do fine. It\u2019s only that it\u2019s a good deal easier to do something that\u2019s a bit dangerous than it is to wait and worry while someone else does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo now you know what\u2019s it like being married to you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I suppose so. Besides, it would be a shame to cheat Young Ian of his adventure. Come on, then, let\u2019s get out of the wind.\u201d</p><p>We moved inland a bit, away from the crumbling edge of the cliff, and sat down to wait, using the horses\u2019 bodies as shelter. Rough, shaggy Highland ponies, they appeared unmoved by the unpleasant weather, merely standing together, heads down, tails turned against the wind.</p><p>The wind was too high for easy conversation. We sat quietly, leaning together like the horses, with our backs to the windy shore.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Jamie raised his head, listening.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard shouting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect it\u2019s the seals,\u201d I said, but before the words were out of my mouth, he was up and striding toward the cliff\u2019s edge.</p><p>The cove was still full of curling mist, but the wind had uncovered the seals\u2019 island, and it was clearly visible, at least for the moment. There were no seals on it now, though.</p><p>A small boat was drawn up on a sloping rock shelf at one side of the island. Not a fisherman\u2019s boat; this one was longer and more pointed at the prow, with one set of oars.</p><p>As I stared, a man appeared from the center of the island. He carried something under one arm, the size and shape of the box Jamie had described. I didn\u2019t have long to speculate as to the nature of this object, though, for just then a second man came up the far slope of the island and into sight.</p><p>This one was carrying Young Ian. He had the boy\u2019s half-naked body slung carelessly over one shoulder. It swung head down, arms dangling with a limpness that made it clear the boy was unconscious or dead.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d Jamie\u2019s hand clamped over my mouth before I could shout again.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d He dragged me to my knees to keep me out of sight. We watched, helpless, as the second man heaved Ian carelessly into the boat, then took hold of the gunwales to run it back into the water. There wasn\u2019t a chance of making the descent down the chimney and the swim to the island before they succeeded in making their escape. But escape to where?</p><p>\u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d I gasped. Nothing else stirred in the cove below, save the mist and the shifting kelp-beds, turning in the tide.</p><p>\u201cA ship. It\u2019s a ship\u2019s boat.\u201d Jamie added something low and heartfelt in Gaelic, and then was gone. I turned to see him fling himself on one of the horses and wrench its head around. Then he was off, riding hell-for-leather across the headland, away from the cove.</p><p>Rough as the footing across the headland was, the horses were shod for it better than I was. I hastily mounted and followed Jamie, a high-pitched whinny of protest from Ian\u2019s hobbled mount ringing in my ears.</p><p>It was less than a quarter of a mile to the ocean side of the headland, but it seemed to take forever to reach it. I saw Jamie ahead of me, his hair flying loose in the wind, and beyond him, the ship, lying to offshore.</p><p>The ground broke away in a tumble of rock that fell down to the ocean, not so steep as the cliffs of the cove, but much too rough to take a horse down. By the time I had reined up, Jamie was off his horse, and picking his way down the rubble toward the water.</p><p>To the left, I could see the longboat from the island, pulling round the curve of the headland. Someone on the ship must have been looking out for them, for I heard a faint hail from the direction of the ship, and saw small figures suddenly appear in the rigging.</p><p>One of these must also have seen us, for there was a sudden agitation aboard, with heads popping up above the rail and more yelling. The ship was blue, with a broad black band painted all around it. There was a line of gunports set in this band, and as I watched, the forward one opened, and the round black eye of the gun peeked out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I shrieked, as loudly as I could. He looked up from the rocks at his feet, saw where I was pointing, and hurled himself flat in the rubble as the gun went off.</p><p>The report wasn\u2019t terribly loud, but there was a sort of whistling noise past my head that made me duck instinctively. Several of the rocks around me exploded in puffs of flying rock chips, and it occurred to me, rather belatedly, that the horses and I were a great deal more visible there at the top of the headland than Jamie was on the cliff below.</p><p>The horses, having grasped this essential fact long before I did, were on their way back to where we had left their hobbled fellow well before the dust had settled. I flung myself bodily over the edge of the headland, slid several feet in a shower of gravel, and wedged myself into a deep crevice in the cliff.</p><p>There was another explosion somewhere above my head, and I pressed myself even closer into the rock. Evidently the people on board the ship were satisfied with the effect of their last shot, for relative silence now descended.</p> <p>My heart was hammering against my ribs, and the air around my face was full of a fine gray dust that gave me an irresistible urge to cough. I risked a look over my shoulder, and was in time to see the longboat being hoisted aboard ship. Of Ian and his two captors, there was no sign.</p><p>The gunport closed silently as I watched, and the rope that held the anchor slithered up, streaming water. The ship turned slowly, seeking wind. The air was light and the sails barely puffed, but even that was enough. Slowly, then faster, she was moving toward the open sea. By the time Jamie had reached my roosting place, the ship had all but vanished in the thick cloudbank that obscured the horizon.</p><p>\u201cJesus\u201d was all he said when he reached me, but he clutched me hard for a moment. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>He let go then, and turned to look out over the sea. Nothing moved save a few tendrils of slow-floating mist. The whole world seemed stricken with silence; even the occasional cries of the murres and shearwaters had been cut off by the cannon\u2019s boom.</p><p>The gray rock near my foot showed a fresh patch of lighter gray, where shot had struck off a wide flake of stone. It was no more than three feet above the crevice where I had taken refuge.</p> <p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d I felt numbed, both by the shock of the afternoon, and by the sheer enormity of what had happened. Impossible to believe that in less than an hour, Ian had disappeared from us as completely as though he had been wiped off the face of the earth. The fogbank loomed thick and impenetrable, a little way off the coast before us, a barrier as impassible as the curtain between earth and the underworld.</p><p>My mind kept replaying images: the mist, drifting over the outlines of the silkies\u2019 island, the sudden appearance of the boat, the men coming over the rocks, Ian\u2019s lanky, teenaged body, white-skinned as the mist, skinny limbs dangling like a disjointed doll\u2019s. I had seen everything with that clarity that attends tragedy; every detail fixed in my mind\u2019s eye, to be shown again and again, always with that half-conscious feeling that this time, I should be able to alter it.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face was set in rigid lines, the furrows cut deep from nose to mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cDamn me to hell, I don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d His hands flexed suddenly into fists at his sides. He shut his eyes, breathing heavily.</p><p>I felt even more frightened at this admission. In the brief time I had been back with him, I had grown once more accustomed to having Jamie always know what to do, even in the direst circumstances. This confession seemed more upsetting than anything that had yet happened.</p><p>A sense of helplessness swirled round me like the mist. Every nerve cried out to do something. But what?</p> <p>I saw the streak of blood on his cuff, then; he had gashed his hand, climbing down the rocks. That, I could help, and I felt a sense of thankfulness that there was, after all, one thing I could do, however small.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve cut yourself,\u201d I said. I touched his injured hand. \u201cLet me see; I\u2019ll wrap it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He turned away, face strained, still looking desperately out into the fog. When I reached for him again, he jerked away.</p><p>\u201cNo, I said! Leave it be!\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and wrapped my arms about myself under my cloak. There was little wind now, even on the headland, but it was cold and clammy nonetheless.</p><p>He rubbed his hand carelessly against the front of his coat, leaving a rusty smear. He was still staring out to sea, toward the spot where the ship had vanished. He closed his eyes, and pressed his lips tight together. Then he opened them, made a small gesture of apology toward me, and turned toward the headland.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we must catch the horses,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>We walked back across the thick, short turf and strewn rocks without speaking, silent with shock and grief. I could see the horses, small stick-legged figures in the distance, clustered together with their hobbled companion. It seemed to have taken hours to run from the headland to the outer shore; going back seemed much longer.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he was dead,\u201d I said, after what seemed like a year. I laid a hand tentatively on Jamie\u2019s arm, meaning to be comforting, but he wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I had struck him with a blackjack. He walked on slowly, head down.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and I saw him swallow hard. \u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t dead, or they\u2019d not have taken him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they take him aboard the ship?\u201d I pressed. \u201cDid you see them?\u201d I thought it might be better for him if he would talk.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAye, they passed him aboard; I saw it clear. I suppose that\u2019s some hope,\u201d he muttered, as though to himself. \u201cIf they didna knock him on the head at once, maybe they won\u2019t.\u201d Suddenly remembering that I was there, he turned and looked at me, eyes searching my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I was scraped raw in several places, covered with filth, and shaky-kneed with fright, but basically sound.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I put my hand on his arm again. This time he let it stay.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said softly, after a moment. He tucked my hand into the crook of his elbow, and we went on.</p><p>\u201cHave you any idea who they were?\u201d I had to raise my voice slightly to be heard above the wash of the surf behind us, but I wanted to keep him talking if I could.</p><p>He shook his head, frowning. The effort of talking seemed to be bringing him slowly out of his own shock.</p><p>\u201cI heard one of the sailors shout to the men in the boat, and he spoke in French. But that proves nothing\u2014sailors come from everywhere. Still, I have seen enough of ships at the docks to think that this one didna have quite the look of a merchant\u2014nor the look of an English ship at all,\u201d he added, \u201cthough I couldna say why, exactly. The way the sails were rigged, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was blue, with a black line painted round it,\u201d I said. \u201cThat was all I had time to see, before the guns started firing.\u201d</p><p>Was it possible to trace a ship? The germ of the idea gave me hope; perhaps the situation was not so hopeless as I had first thought. If Ian was not dead, and we could find out where the ship was going...</p><p>\u201cDid you see a name on it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA name?\u201d He looked faintly surprised at the notion. \u201cWhat, on the ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ships not usually have their names painted on the sides?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, what for?\u201d He sounded honestly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cSo you could bloody tell who they are!\u201d I said, exasperated. Taken by surprise by my tone, he actually smiled a little.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I should expect that perhaps they dinna much want anyone telling who they are, given their business,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>We paced on together for a few moments, thinking. Then I said curiously, \u201cWell, but how do legitimate ships tell who each other is, if they haven\u2019t got names painted on?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cI should know you from another woman,\u201d he pointed out, \u201cand ye havena got your name stitched upon your bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much as a letter \u2018A,\u2019\u201d I said, flippantly, but seeing his blank look, added, \u201cYou mean ships look different enough\u2014and there are few enough of them\u2014that you can tell one from another just by looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cI know a few; ships where I ken the captain, and have been aboard to do business, or a few like the packet boats, that go back and forth so often that I\u2019ve seen them in port dozens of times. But a sailing man would ken a great deal more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it might be possible to find out what the ship that took Ian is called?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking at me curiously. \u201cAye, I think so. I have been trying to call to mind everything about it as we walked, so as to tell Jared. He\u2019ll know a great many ships, and a great many more captains\u2014and perhaps one of them will know a blue ship, wide in the beam, with three masts, twelve guns, and a scowling figurehead.\u201d</p><p>My heart bounded upward. \u201cSo you do have a plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna call it so much a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only I canna think of anything else to do.\u201d He shrugged, and wiped a hand over his face. Tiny droplets of moisture were condensing on us as we walked, glistening in the ruddy hairs of his eyebrows and coating his cheeks with a wetness like tears. He sighed.</p><p>\u201cThe passage is arranged from Inverness. The best I can see to do is to go; Jared will be expecting us in Le Havre. When we see him, perhaps he can help us to find out what the blue ship is called, and maybe where it\u2019s bound. Aye,\u201d he said dryly, anticipating my question, \u201cships have home ports, and if they dinna belong to the navy, they have runs they commonly make, and papers for the harbormaster, too, showing where they\u2019re bound.\u201d</p><p>I began to feel better than I had since Ian had descended Ellen\u2019s tower.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re not pirates or privateers, that is,\u201d he added, with a warning look which put an immediate damper on my rising spirits.</p><p>\u201cAnd if they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen God knows, but I don\u2019t,\u201d he said briefly, and would not say any more until we reached the horses.</p><p>They were grazing on the headland near the tower where we had left Ian\u2019s mount, behaving as though nothing had happened, pretending to find the tough sea grass delicious.</p><p>\u201cTcha!\u201d Jamie viewed them disapprovingly. \u201cSilly beasts.\u201d He grabbed the coil of rope and wrapped it twice round a projecting stone. Handing me the end, with a terse instruction to hold it, he dropped the free end down the chimney, shed his coat and shoes, and disappeared down the rope himself without further remark.</p><p>Sometime later, he came back up, sweating profusely, with a small bundle tucked under his arm. Young Ian\u2019s shirt, coat, shoes and stockings, with his knife and the small leather pouch in which the lad kept such valuables as he had.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to take them home to Jenny?\u201d I asked. I tried to imagine what Jenny might think, say, or do at the news, and succeeded all too well. I felt a little sick, knowing that the hollow, aching sense of loss I felt was as nothing to what hers would be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie\u2019s face was flushed from the climb, but at my words, the blood drained from his cheeks. His hands tightened on the bundle.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said, very softly, with great bitterness. \u201cAye, I shall go home and tell my sister that I have lost her youngest son? She didna want him to come wi\u2019 me, but I insisted. I\u2019ll take care of him, I said. And now he is hurt and maybe dead\u2014but here are his clothes, to remember him by?\u201d His jaw clenched, and he swallowed convulsively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be dead myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>He knelt on the ground then, shaking out the articles of clothing, folding them carefully, and laying them together in a pile. He folded the coat carefully around the other things, stood up, and stuffed the bundle into his saddlebag.</p> <p>\u201cIan will be needing them, I expect, when we find him,\u201d I said, trying to sound convinced.</p><p>Jamie looked at me, but after a moment, he nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI expect he will.\u201d</p><p>It was too late in the day to begin the ride to Inverness. The sun was setting, announcing the fact with a dull reddish glow that barely penetrated the gathering mist. Without speaking, we began to make camp. There was cold food in the saddlebags, but neither of us had the heart to eat. Instead, we rolled ourselves up in cloaks and blankets and lay down to sleep, cradled in small hollows that Jamie had scooped in the earth.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sleep. The ground was hard and stony beneath my hips and shoulders, and the thunder of the surf below would have been sufficient to keep me awake, even had my mind not been filled with thoughts of Ian.</p> <p>Was he badly hurt? The limpness of his body had bespoken some damage, but I had seen no blood. Presumably, he had merely been hit on the head. If so, what would he feel when he woke, to find himself abducted, and being carried farther from home and family with each passing minute?</p><p>And how were we ever to find him? When Jamie had first mentioned Jared, I had felt hopeful, but the more I thought of it, the slimmer seemed the prospects of actually finding a single ship, which might now be sailing in any direction at all, to anyplace in the world. And would his captors bother to keep Ian, or would they, on second thoughts, conclude that he was a dangerous nuisance, and pitch him overboard?</p><p>I didn\u2019t think I slept, but I must have dozed, my dreams full of trouble. I woke shivering with cold, and edged out a hand, reaching for Jamie. He wasn\u2019t there. When I sat up, I found that he had spread his blanket over me while I dozed, but it was a poor substitute for the heat of his body.</p><p>He was sitting some distance away, with his back to me. The offshore wind had risen with the setting of the sun, and blown some of the mist away; a half-moon shed enough light through the clouds to show me his hunched figure clearly.</p><p>I got up and walked over to him, folding my cloak tight about me against the chill. My steps made a light crunching sound on the crumbled granite, but the sound was drowned in the sighing rumble of the sea below. Still, he must have heard me; he didn\u2019t turn around, but gave no sign of surprise when I sank down beside him.</p><p>He sat with his chin in his hands, his elbows on his knees, eyes wide and sightless as he gazed out into the dark water of the cove. If the seals were awake, they were quiet tonight.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s beastly cold.\u201d He was wearing nothing but his coat, and in the small, chilled hours of the night, in the wet, cold air above the sea, that was far from enough. I could feel the tiny, constant shiver that ran through him when I set my hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, with a marked lack of conviction.</p><p>I merely snorted at this piece of prevarication, and sat down next to him on another chunk of granite.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d I said, after we had sat in silence for some time, listening to the sea.</p><p>\u201cYe should go and sleep, Sassenach.\u201d His voice was even, but with an undertone of hopelessness that made me move closer to him, trying to embrace him. He was clearly reluctant to touch me, but I was shivering very obviously myself by this time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply and pulled me closer, settling me upon his knee, so that his arms came inside my cloak, holding tight. Little by little, the shivering eased.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d I asked at last.</p> <p>\u201cPraying,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOr trying to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have interrupted you.\u201d I made as though to move away, but his hold on me tightened.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay,\u201d he said. We stayed clasped close; I could feel the warmth of his breathing in my ear. He drew in his breath as though about to speak, but then let it out without saying anything. I turned and touched his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong for me to have ye?\u201d he whispered. His face was bone-white, his eyes no more than dark pits in the dim light. \u201cI keep thinking\u2014is it my fault? Have I sinned so greatly, wanting you so much, needing ye more than life itself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d I took his face between my hands, feeling the wide bones cold under my palms. \u201cAnd if you do\u2014how can that be wrong? I\u2019m your wife.\u201d In spite of everything, the simple word \u201cwife\u201d made my heart lighten.</p><p>He turned his face slightly, so his lips lay against my palm, and his hand came up, groping for mine. His fingers were cold, too, and hard as driftwood soaked in seawater.</p><p>\u201cI tell myself so. God has given ye to me; how can I not love you? And yet\u2014I keep thinking, and canna stop.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me then, brow furrowed with trouble.</p><p>\u201cThe treasure\u2014it was all right to use it when there was need, to feed the hungry, or to rescue folk from prison. But to try to buy my freedom from guilt\u2014to use it only so that I might live free at Lallybroch with you, and not trouble myself over Laoghaire\u2014I think maybe that was wrong to do.\u201d</p><p>I drew his hand down around my waist, and pulled him close. He came, eager for comfort, and laid his head on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d I said to him, though he hadn\u2019t spoken again. \u201cBe still. Jamie, have you ever done something for yourself alone\u2014not with any thought of anyone else?\u201d</p><p>His hand rested gently on my back, tracing the seam of my bodice, and his breathing held the hint of a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, many and many a time,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWhen I saw you. When I took ye, not caring did ye want me or no, did ye have somewhere else to be, someone else to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody man,\u201d I whispered in his ear, rocking him as best I could. \u201cYou\u2019re an awful fool, Jamie Fraser. And what about Brianna? That wasn\u2019t wrong, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He swallowed; I could hear the sound of it clearly, and feel the pulse beat in his neck where I held him. \u201cBut now I have taken ye back from her, as well. I love you\u2014and I love Ian, like he was my own. And I am thinking maybe I cannot have ye both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie Fraser,\u201d I said again, with as much conviction as I could put into my voice, \u201cyou\u2019re a terrible fool.\u201d I smoothed the hair back from his forehead and twisted my fist in the thick tail at his nape, pulling his head back to make him look at me.</p><p>I thought my face must look to him as his did to me; the bleached bones of a skull, with the lips and eyes dark as blood.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t force me to come to you, or snatch me away from Brianna. I came, because I wanted to\u2014because I wanted you, as much as you did me\u2014and my being here has nothing to do with what\u2019s happened. We\u2019re married, blast you, by any standard you care to name\u2014before God, man, Neptune, or what-have-you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeptune?\u201d he said, sounding a little stunned.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re married, I say, and it isn\u2019t wicked for you to want me, or to have me, and no God worth his salt would take your nephew away from you because you wanted to be happy. So there!</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d I added, pulling back and looking up at him a moment later, \u201cI\u2019m not bloody going back, so what could you do about it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>The small vibration in his chest this time was laughter, not cold.</p><p>\u201cTake ye and be damned for it, I expect,\u201d he said. He kissed my forehead gently. \u201cLoving you has put me through hell more than once, Sassenach; I\u2019ll risk it again, if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBah,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you think loving you\u2019s been a bed of roses, do you?\u201d</p><p>This time he laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019ll maybe keep doing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will, at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a verra stubborn woman,\u201d he said, the smile clear in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt bloody takes one to know one,\u201d I said, and then we were both quiet for quite some time.</p><p>It was very late\u2014perhaps four o\u2019clock in the morning. The half-moon was low in the sky, seen only now and then through the moving clouds. The clouds themselves were moving faster; the wind was shifting and the mist breaking up, in the turning hour between dark and dawn. Somewhere below, one of the seals barked loudly, once.</p><p>\u201cDo ye think perhaps ye could stand to go now?\u201d Jamie said suddenly. \u201cNot wait for the daylight? Once off the headland, the going\u2019s none so bad that the horses canna manage in the dark.\u201d</p><p>My whole body ached from weariness, and I was starving, but I stood up at once, and brushed the hair out of my face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said.</p><p>PART EIGHT</p><p>On the Water</p><p>40</p><p>I SHALL GO DOWN TO THE SEA</p><p>\u201cIt will have to be the Artemis.\u201d Jared flipped shut the cover of his portable writing desk and rubbed his brow, frowning. Jamie\u2019s cousin had been in his fifties when I knew him before, and was now well past seventy, but the snub-nosed hatchet face, the spare, narrow frame, and the tireless capacity for work were just the same. Only his hair marked his age, gone from lank darkness to a scanty, pure and gleaming white, jauntily tied with a red silk ribbon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no more than a midsized sloop, with a crew of forty or so,\u201d he remarked. \u201cBut it\u2019s late in the season, and we\u2019ll not likely do better\u2014all of the Indiamen will have gone a month since. Artemis would have gone with the convoy to Jamaica, was she not laid up for repair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sooner have a ship of yours\u2014and one of your captains,\u201d Jamie assured him. \u201cThe size doesna matter.\u201d</p><p>Jared cocked a skeptical eyebrow at his cousin. \u201cOh? Well, and ye may find it matter more than ye think, out at sea. It\u2019s like to be squally, this late in the season, and a sloop will be bobbin\u2019 like a cork. Might I ask how ye weathered the Channel crossing in the packet boat, cousin?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face, already drawn and grim, grew somewhat grimmer at this question. The completest of landlubbers, he was not just prone to seasickness, but prostrated by it. He had been violently ill all the way from Inverness to Le Havre, though sea and weather had been quite calm. Now, some six hours later, safe ashore in Jared\u2019s warehouse by the quay, there was still a pale tinge to his lips and dark circles beneath his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d he said shortly.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared eyed him dubiously, well aware of his response to seagoing craft of any kind. Jamie could scarcely set foot on a ship at anchor without going green; the prospect of his crossing the Atlantic, sealed inescapably in a small and constantly tossing ship for two or three months, was enough to boggle the stoutest mind. It had been troubling mine for some time.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose there\u2019s no help for it,\u201d Jared said with a sigh, echoing my thought. \u201cAnd at least you\u2019ll have a physician to hand,\u201d he added, with a smile at me. \u201cThat is, I suppose you intend accompanying him, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes indeed,\u201d I assured him. \u201cHow long will it be before the ship is ready? I\u2019d like to find a good apothecary\u2019s, to stock my medicine chest before the voyage.\u201d</p><p>Jared pursed his lips in concentration. \u201cA week, God willing,\u201d he said. \u201cArtemis is in Bilbao at the moment; she\u2019s to carry a cargo of tanned Spanish hides, with a load of copper from Italy\u2014she\u2019ll ship that here, once she arrives, which should be day after tomorrow, with a fair wind. I\u2019ve no captain signed on for the voyage yet, but a good man in mind; I may have to go to Paris to fetch him, though, and that will be two days there and two back. Add a day to complete stores, fill the water casks, add all the bits and pieces, and she should be ready to leave at dawn tomorrow week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long to the West Indies?\u201d Jamie asked. The tension in him showed in the lines of his body, little affected either by our journey or by the brief rest. He was strung taut as a bow, and likely to remain so until we had found Young Ian.</p><p>\u201cTwo months, in the season,\u201d Jared replied, the small frown still lining his forehead. \u201cBut you\u2019re a month past the season now; hit the winter gales and it could be three. Or more.\u201d</p><p>Or never, but Jared, ex-seaman that he was, was too superstitious\u2014or too tactful\u2014to voice this possibility. Still, I saw him touch the wood of his desk surreptitiously for luck.</p><p>Neither would he voice the other thought that occupied my mind; we had no positive proof that the blue ship was headed for the West Indies. We had only the records Jared had obtained for us from the Le Havre harbormaster, showing two visits by the ship\u2014aptly named Bruja\u2014within the last five years, each time giving her home port as Bridgetown, on the island of Barbados.</p><p>\u201cTell me about her again\u2014the ship that took Young Ian,\u201d Jared said. \u201cHow did she ride? High in the water, or sunk low, as if she were loaded heavy for a voyage?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie closed his eyes for a moment, concentrating, then opened them with a nod. \u201cHeavy-laden, I could swear it. Her gunports were no more than six feet from the water.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded, satisfied. \u201cThen she was leaving port, not coming in. I\u2019ve messengers out to all the major ports in France, Portugal and Spain. With luck, they\u2019ll find the port she shipped from, and then we\u2019ll know her destination for sure from her papers.\u201d His thin lips quirked suddenly downward. \u201cUnless she\u2019s turned pirate, and sailing under false papers, that is.\u201d</p><p>The old wine merchant carefully set aside the lap desk, its carved mahogany richly darkened by years of use, and rose to his feet, moving stiffly.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the most that can be done for the moment. Let\u2019s go to the house, now; Mathilde will have supper waiting. Tomorrow I\u2019ll take ye over the manifests and orders, and your wife can find her bits of herbs.\u201d</p><p>It was nearly five o\u2019clock, and full dark at this time of year, but Jared had two linksmen waiting to escort us the short distance to his house, equipped with torches to light the way and armed with stout clubs. Le Havre was a thriving port city, and the quay district was no place to walk alone after dark, particularly if one was known as a prosperous wine merchant.</p><p>Despite the exhaustion of the Channel crossing, the oppressive clamminess and pervasive fish-smell of Le Havre, and a gnawing hunger, I felt my spirits rise as we followed the torches through the dark, narrow streets. Thanks to Jared, we had at least a chance of finding Young Ian.</p> <p>Jared had concurred with Jamie\u2019s opinion that if the pirates of the Bruja\u2014for so I thought of them\u2014had not killed Young Ian on the spot, they were likely to keep him unharmed. A healthy young male of any race could be sold as a slave or indentured servant in the West Indies for upward of two hundred pounds; a respectable sum by current standards.</p><p>If they did intend so to dispose of Young Ian profitably, and if we knew the port to which they were sailing, it should be a reasonably easy matter to find and recover the boy. A gust of wind and a few chilly drops from the hovering clouds dampened my optimism slightly, reminding me that while it might be no great matter to find Ian once we had reached the West Indies, both the Bruja and the Artemis had to reach the islands first. And the winter storms were beginning.</p><p>The rain increased through the night, drumming insistently on the slate roof above our heads. I would normally have found the sound soothing and soporific; under the circumstances, the low thrum seemed threatening, not peaceful.</p><p>Despite Jared\u2019s substantial dinner and the excellent wines that accompanied it, I found myself unable to sleep, my mind summoning images of rain-soaked canvas and the swell of heavy seas. At least my morbid imaginings were keeping only myself awake; Jamie had not come up with me but had stayed to talk with Jared about the arrangements for the upcoming voyage.</p><p>Jared was willing to risk a ship and a captain to help in the search. In return, Jamie would sail as supercargo.</p><p>\u201cAs what?\u201d I had said, hearing this proposal.</p><p>\u201cThe supercargo,\u201d Jared had explained patiently. \u201cThat\u2019s the man whose duty it is to oversee the loading, the unloading, and the sale and disposition of the cargo. The captain and the crew merely sail the ship; someone\u2019s got to look after the contents. In a case where the welfare of the cargo will be affected, the supercargo\u2019s orders may override even the captain\u2019s authority.\u201d</p><p>And so it was arranged. While Jared was more than willing to go to some risk in order to help a kinsman, he saw no reason not to profit from the arrangement. He had therefore made quick provision for a miscellaneous cargo to be loaded from Bilbao and Le Havre; we would sail to Jamaica to upload the bulk of it, and would arrange for the reloading of the Artemis with rum produced by the sugarcane plantation of Fraser et Cie on Jamaica, for the return trip.</p> <p>The return trip, however, would not occur until good sailing weather returned, in late April or early May. For the time between arrival on Jamaica in February and return to Scotland in May, Jamie would have disposal of the Artemis and her crew, to travel to Barbados\u2014or other places\u2014in search of Young Ian. Three months. I hoped it would be enough.</p><p>It was a generous arrangement. Still, Jared, who had been an expatriate wine-seller for many years in France, was wealthy enough that the loss of a ship, while distressing, would not cripple him. The fact did not escape me that while Jared was risking a small portion of his fortune, we were risking our lives.</p><p>The wind seemed to be dying; it no longer howled down the chimney with quite such force. Sleep proving still elusive, I got out of bed, and with a quilt wrapped round my shoulders for warmth, went to the window.</p><p>The sky was a deep, mottled gray, the scudding rain clouds edged with brilliant light from the moon that hid behind them, and the glass was streaked with rain. Still, enough light seeped through the clouds for me to make out the masts of the ships moored at the quay, less than a quarter of a mile away. They swayed to and fro, their sails furled tight against the storm, rising and falling in uneasy rhythm as the waves rocked the boats at anchor. In a week\u2019s time, I would be on one.</p><p>I had not dared to think what life might be like once I had found Jamie, lest I not find him after all. Then I had found him, and in quick succession, had contemplated life as a printer\u2019s wife among the political and literary worlds of Edinburgh, a dangerous and fugitive existence as a smuggler\u2019s lady, and finally, the busy, settled life of a Highland farm, which I had known before and loved.</p><p>Now, in equally quick succession, all these possibilities had been jerked away, and I faced an unknown future once more.</p><p>Oddly enough, I was not so much distressed by this as excited by it. I had been settled for twenty years, rooted as a barnacle by my attachments to Brianna, to Frank, to my patients. Now fate\u2014and my own actions\u2014had ripped me loose from all those things, and I felt as though I were tumbling free in the surf, at the mercy of forces a great deal stronger than myself.</p><p>My breath had misted the glass. I traced a small heart in the cloudiness, as I had used to do for Brianna on cold mornings. Then, I would put her initials inside the heart\u2014B.E.R., for Brianna Ellen Randall. Would she still call herself Randall? I wondered, or Fraser, now? I hesitated, then drew two letters inside the outline of the heart\u2014a \u201cJ\u201d and a \u201cC.\u201d</p><p>I was still standing before the window when the door opened and Jamie came in.</p><p>\u201cAre ye awake still?\u201d he asked, rather unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cThe rain kept me from sleeping.\u201d I went and embraced him, glad of his warm solidness to dispel the cold gloom of the night.</p><p>He hugged me, resting his cheek against my hair. He smelt faintly of seasickness, much more strongly of candlewax and ink.</p><p>\u201cHave you been writing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked down at me in astonishment. \u201cI have, but how did ye know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou smell of ink.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly, stepping back and running his hand through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve a nose as keen as a truffle pig\u2019s, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you, what a graceful compliment,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat were you writing?\u201d</p><p>The smile disappeared from his face, leaving him looking strained and tired.</p><p>\u201cA letter to Jenny,\u201d he said. He went to the table, where he shed his coat and began to unfasten his stock and jabot. \u201cI didna want to write her until we\u2019d seen Jared, and I could tell her what plans we had, and what the prospects were for bringing Ian home safe.\u201d He grimaced, and pulled the shirt over his head. \u201cGod knows what she\u2019ll do when she gets it\u2014and thank God, I\u2019ll be at sea when she does,\u201d he added wryly, emerging from the folds of linen.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t have been an easy piece of composition, but I thought he seemed easier for the writing of it. He sat down to take off his shoes and stockings, and I came behind him to undo the clubbed queue of his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad the writing\u2019s over, at least,\u201d he said, echoing my thought. \u201cI\u2019d been dreading telling her, more than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her the truth?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>Except about me. I didn\u2019t voice the thought, though, but began to rub his shoulders, kneading the knotted muscles.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Jared do with Mr. Willoughby?\u201d I asked, massage bringing the Chinese to mind. He had accompanied us on the Channel crossing, sticking to Jamie like a small blue-silk shadow. Jared, used to seeing everything on the docks, had taken Mr. Willoughby in stride, bowing gravely to him and addressing him with a few words of Mandarin, but his housekeeper had viewed this unusual guest with considerably more suspicion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI believe he\u2019s gone to sleep in the stable.\u201d Jamie yawned, and stretched himself luxuriously. \u201cMathilde said she wasna accustomed to have heathens in the house and didna mean to start now. She was sprinkling the kitchen wi\u2019 holy water after he ate supper there.\u201d Glancing up, he caught sight of the heart I had traced on the windowpane, black against the misted glass, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust silliness,\u201d I said.</p><p>He reached up and took my right hand, the ball of his thumb caressing the small scar at the base of my own thumb, the letter \u201cJ\u201d he had made with the point of his knife, just before I left him, before Culloden.</p> <p>\u201cI didna ask,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether ye wished to come with me. I could leave ye here; Jared would have ye stay wi\u2019 him and welcome, here or in Paris. Or ye could go back to Lallybroch, if ye wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t ask,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause you knew bloody well what the answer would be.\u201d</p><p>We looked at each other and smiled. The lines of heartsickness and weariness had lifted from his face. The candlelight glowed softly on the burnished crown of his head as he bent and gently kissed the palm of my hand.</p><p>The wind still whistled in the chimney, and the rain ran down the glass like tears outside, but it no longer mattered. Now I could sleep.</p><p>The sky had cleared by morning. A brisk, cold breeze rattled the windowpanes of Jared\u2019s study, but couldn\u2019t penetrate to the cozy room inside. The house at Le Havre was much smaller than his lavish Paris residence, but still boasted three stories of solid, half-timbered comfort.</p> <p>I pushed my feet farther toward the crackling fire, and dipped my quill into the inkwell. I was making up a list of all the things I thought might be needed in the medical way for a two-month voyage. Distilled alcohol was both the most important and the easiest to obtain; Jared had promised to get me a cask in Paris.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best label it something else, though,\u201d he\u2019d told me. \u201cOr the sailors will have drunk it before you\u2019ve left port.\u201d</p><p>Purified lard, I wrote slowly, St.-John\u2019s-wort; garlic, ten pounds; yarrow. I wrote borage, then shook my head and crossed it out, replacing it with the older name by which it was more likely known now, bugloss.</p><p>It was slow work. At one time, I had known the medicinal uses of all the common herbs, and not a few uncommon ones. I had had to; they were all that was available.</p><p>At that, many of them were surprisingly effective. Despite the skepticism\u2014and outspoken horror\u2014of my supervisors and colleagues at the hospital in Boston, I had used them occasionally on my modern patients to good effect. (\u201cDid you see what Dr. Randall did?\u201d a shocked intern\u2019s cry echoed in memory, making me smile as I wrote. \u201cShe fed the stomach in 134B boiled flowers!\u201d)</p><p>The fact remained that one wouldn\u2019t use yarrow and comfrey on a wound if iodine were available, nor treat a systemic infection with bladderwort in preference to penicillin.</p> <p>I had forgotten a lot, but as I wrote the names of the herbs, the look and the smell of each one began to come back to me\u2014the dark, bituminous look and pleasant light smell of birch oil, the sharp tang of the mint family, the dusty sweet smell of chamomile and the astringency of bistort.</p><p>Across the table, Jamie was struggling with his own lists. A poor penman, he wrote laboriously with his crippled right hand, pausing now and then to rub the healing wound above his left elbow and mutter curses under his breath.</p><p>\u201cHave ye lime juice on your list, Sassenach?\u201d he inquired, looking up.</p><p>\u201cNo. Ought I to have?\u201d</p><p>He brushed a strand of hair out of his face and frowned at the sheet of paper in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIt depends. Customarily, it would be the ship\u2019s surgeon who provides the lime juice, but in a ship the size of the Artemis, there generally isn\u2019t a surgeon, and the provision of foodstuffs falls to the purser. But there isn\u2019t a purser, either; there\u2019s no time to find a dependable man, so I shall fill that office, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019ll be purser and supercargo, I expect I\u2019ll be the closest thing to a ship\u2019s surgeon,\u201d I said, smiling slightly. \u201cI\u2019ll get the lime juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d We returned to a companionable scratching, unbroken until the entrance of Josephine, the parlormaid, to announce the arrival of a person. Her long nose wrinkled in unconscious disapproval at the information.</p> <p>\u201cHe waits upon the doorstep. The butler tried to send him away, but he insists that he has an appointment with you, Monsieur James?\u201d The questioning tone of this last implied that nothing could seem more unlikely, but duty compelled her to relay the improbable suggestion.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cA person? What sort of person?\u201d Josephine\u2019s lips primmed together as though she really could not bring herself to say. I was becoming curious to see this person, and ventured over to the window. Sticking my head far out, I could see the top of a very dusty black slouch hat on the doorstep, and not much more.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a peddler; he\u2019s got a bundle of some kind on his back,\u201d I reported, craning out still farther, hands on the sill. Jamie clutched me by the waist and drew me back, thrusting his own head out in turn.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s the coin dealer Jared mentioned!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cBring him up, then.\u201d</p><p>With an eloquent expression on her narrow face, Josephine departed, returning in short order with a tall, gangling youth of perhaps twenty, dressed in a badly outmoded style of coat, wide unbuckled breeches that flapped limply about his skinny shanks, drooping stockings and the cheapest of wooden sabots.</p><p>The filthy black hat, courteously removed indoors, revealed a thin face with an intelligent expression, adorned with a vigorous, if scanty, brown beard. Since virtually no one in Le Havre other than a few seamen wore a beard, it hardly needed the small shiny black skullcap on the newcomer\u2019s head to tell me he was a Jew.</p><p>The boy bowed awkwardly to me, then to Jamie, struggling with the straps of his peddler\u2019s pack.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d he said, with a bob that made his curly sidelocks dance, \u201cMonsieur. It is most good of you to receive me.\u201d He spoke French oddly, with a singsong intonation that made him hard to follow.</p><p>While I entirely understood Josephine\u2019s reservations about this...person, still, he had wide, guileless blue eyes that made me smile at him despite his generally unprepossessing appearance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s we who should be grateful to you,\u201d Jamie was saying. \u201cI had not expected you to come so promptly. My cousin tells me your name is Mayer?\u201d</p><p>The coin dealer nodded, a shy smile breaking out amid the sprigs of his youthful beard.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mayer. It is no trouble; I was in the city already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you come from Frankfort, no? A long way,\u201d Jamie said politely. He smiled as he looked over Mayer\u2019s costume, which looked as though he had retrieved it from a rubbish tip.\u201cAnd a dusty one, too, I expect,\u201d he added. \u201cWill you take wine?\u201d</p><p>Mayer looked flustered at this offer, but after opening and closing his mouth a few times, finally settled on a silent nod of acceptance.</p><p>His shyness vanished, though, once the pack was opened. Though from the outside the shapeless bundle looked as though it might contain, at best, a change of ragged linen and Mayer\u2019s midday meal, once opened it revealed several small wooden racks, cleverly fitted into a framework inside the pack, each rack packed carefully with tiny leather bags, cuddling together like eggs in a nest.</p><p>Mayer removed a folded square of fabric from beneath the racks, whipped it open, and spread it with something of a flourish on Jamie\u2019s desk. Then one by one, Mayer opened the bags and drew out the contents, placing each gleaming round reverently on the deep blue velvet of the cloth.</p><p>\u201cAn Aquilia Severa aureus,\u201d he said, touching one small coin that glowed with the deep mellowness of ancient gold from the velvet. \u201cAnd here, a Sestercius of the Calpurnia family.\u201d His voice was soft and his hands sure, stroking the edge of a silver coin only slightly worn, or cradling one in his palm to demonstrate the weight of it.</p><p>He looked up from the coins, eyes bright with the reflections of the precious metal.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Fraser tells me that you desire to inspect as many of the Greek and Roman rarities as possible. I have not my whole stock with me, of course, but I have quite a few\u2014and I could send to Frankfort for others, if you desire.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we haven\u2019t time, Mr. Mayer. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Mayer, Monsieur Fraser,\u201d the young man interrupted, perfectly polite, but with a slight edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jamie bowed slightly. \u201cI hope my cousin shall not have misled you. I shall be most happy to pay the cost of your journey, and something for your time, but I am not wishful to purchase any of your stock myself...Mayer.\u201d</p><p>The young man\u2019s eyebrows rose in inquiry, along with one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat I wish,\u201d Jamie said slowly, leaning forward to look closely at the coins on display, \u201cis to compare your stock with my recollection of several ancient coins I have seen, and then\u2014should I see any that are similar\u2014to inquire whether you\u2014or your family, I should say, for I expect you are too young yourself\u2014should be familiar with anyone who might have purchased such coins twenty years ago.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at the young Jew, who was looking justifiably astonished, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat may be asking a bit much of you, I know. But my cousin tells me that your family is one of the few who deals in such matters, and is by far the most knowledgeable. If you can acquaint me likewise with any persons in the West Indies with interests in this area, I should be deeply obliged to you.\u201d</p><p>Mayer sat looking at him for a moment, then inclined his head, the sunlight winking from the border of small jet beads that adorned his skullcap. It was plain that he was intensely curious, but he merely touched his pack and said, \u201cMy father or my uncle would have sold such coins, not me; but I have here the catalogue and record of every coin that has passed through our hands in thirty years. I will tell you what I can.\u201d</p><p>He drew the velvet cloth toward Jamie and sat back.</p><p>\u201cDo you see anything here like the coins you remember?\u201d</p><p>Jamie studied the rows of coins with close attention, then gently nudged a silver piece, about the size of an American quarter. Three leaping porpoises circled its edge, surrounding a charioteer in the center.</p><p>\u201cThis one,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were several like it\u2014small differences, but several with these porpoises.\u201d He looked again, picked out a worn gold disc with an indistinct profile, then a silver one, somewhat larger and in better condition, with a man\u2019s head shown both full-face and in profile.</p><p>\u201cThese,\u201d he said. \u201cFourteen of the gold ones, and ten of the ones with two heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen!\u201d Mayer\u2019s bright eyes popped wide with astonishment. \u201cI should not have thought there were so many in Europe.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain\u2014I saw them closely; handled them, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are the twin heads of Alexander,\u201d Mayer said, touching the coin with reverence. \u201cVery rare indeed. It is a tetradrachm, struck to commemorate the battle fought at Amphipolos, and the founding of a city on the site of the battlefield.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie listened with attention, a slight smile on his lips. While he had no great interest in ancient money himself, he did have a great appreciation for a man with a passion.</p><p>A quarter of an hour more, another consultation of the catalogue, and the business was complete. Four Greek drachmas of a type Jamie recognized had been added to the collection, several small gold and silver coins, and a thing called a quintinarius, a Roman coin in heavy gold.</p><p>Mayer bent and reached into his pack once more, this time pulling out a sheaf of foolscap pages furled into a roll and tied with ribbon. Untied, they showed row upon row of what looked from a distance like bird tracks; on closer inspection, they proved to be Hebraic writing, inked small and precise.</p><p>He thumbed slowly through the pages, stopping here and there with a murmured \u201cUm,\u201d then passing on. At last he laid the pages on his shabby knee and looked up at Jamie, head cocked to one side.</p> <p>\u201cOur transactions are naturally carried out in confidence, Monsieur,\u201d he said, \u201cand so while I could tell you, for example, that certainly we had sold such and such a coin, in such and such a year, I should not be able to tell you the name of the purchaser.\u201d He paused, evidently thinking, then went on.</p><p>\u201cWe did in fact sell coins of your description\u2014three drachmas, two each of the heads of Egalabalus and the double head of Alexander, and no fewer than six of the gold Calpurnian aurei in the year 1745.\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNormally, that is all I could tell you. However...in this case, Monsieur, I happen to know that the original buyer of these coins is dead\u2014has been dead for some years, in fact. Really, I cannot see that under the circumstances...\u201d He shrugged, making up his mind.</p><p>\u201cThe purchaser was an Englishman, Monsieur. His name was Clarence Marylebone, Duke of Sandringham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandringham!\u201d I exclaimed, startled into speech.</p> <p>Mayer looked curiously at me, then at Jamie, whose face betrayed nothing beyond polite interest.</p><p>\u201cYes, Madame,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that the Duke is dead, for he possessed an extensive collection of ancient coins, which my uncle bought from his heirs in 1746\u2014the transaction is listed here.\u201d He raised the catalogue slightly, and let it fall.</p><p>I knew the Duke of Sandringham was dead, too, and by more immediate experience. Jamie\u2019s godfather, Murtagh, had killed him, on a dark night in March 1746, soon before the battle of Culloden brought an end to the Jacobite rebellion. I swallowed briefly, recalling my last sight of the Duke\u2019s face, its blueberry eyes fixed in an expression of intense surprise.</p><p>Mayer\u2019s eyes went back and forth between us, then he added hesitantly, \u201cI can tell you also this; when my uncle purchased the Duke\u2019s collection after his death, there were no tetradrachms in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie murmured, to himself. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d Then, recollecting himself, he stood and reached for the decanter that stood on the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cI thank you, Mayer,\u201d he said formally. \u201cAnd now, let us drink to you and your wee book, there.\u201d</p> <p>A few minutes later, Mayer was kneeling on the floor, doing up the fastenings of his ragged pack. The small pouch filled with silver livres that Jamie had given him in payment was in his pocket. He rose and bowed in turn to Jamie and to me before straightening and putting on his disreputable hat.</p><p>\u201cI bid you goodbye, Madame,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye to you, too, Mayer,\u201d I replied. Then I asked, somewhat hesitantly, \u201cIs \u2018Mayer\u2019 really your only name?\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in the wide blue eyes, but he answered politely, heaving the heavy sack onto his back, \u201cYes, Madame. The Jews of Frankfort are not allowed to use family names.\u201d He looked up and smiled lopsidedly. \u201cFor the sake of convenience, the neighbors call us after an old red shield that was painted on the front of our house, many years ago. But beyond that...no, Madame. We have no name.\u201d</p><p>Josephine came then to conduct our visitor to the kitchen, taking care to walk several paces in front of him, her nostrils pinched white as though smelling something foul. Mayer stumbled after her, his clumsy sabots clattering on the polished floor.</p><p>Jamie relaxed in his chair, eyes abstracted in deep thought.</p><p>I heard the door close downstairs a few minutes later, with what was almost a slam, and the click of sabots on the stone steps below. Jamie heard it too, and turned toward the window.</p><p>\u201cWell, Godspeed to ye, Mayer Red-Shield,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said, suddenly thinking of something, \u201cdo you speak German?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh? Oh, aye,\u201d he said vaguely, his attention still fixed on the window and the noises outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat is \u2018red shield\u2019 in German?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked blank for a moment, then his eyes cleared as his brain made the proper connection.</p><p>\u201cRothschild, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a thought,\u201d I said. I looked toward the window, where the clatter of wooden shoes was long since lost in the noises of the street. \u201cI suppose everyone has to start somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen men on a dead man\u2019s chest,\u201d I observed. \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave me a look.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke being the dead man,\u201d I explained. \u201cDo you think the seals\u2019 treasure was really his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldna say for sure, but it seems at least likely.\u201d Jamie\u2019s two stiff fingers tapped briefly on the table in a meditative rhythm. \u201cWhen Jared mentioned Mayer the coin dealer to me, I thought it worth inquiring\u2014for surely the most likely person to have sent the Bruja to retrieve the treasure was the person who put it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood reasoning,\u201d I said, \u201cbut evidently it wasn\u2019t the same person, if it was the Duke who put it there. Do you think the whole treasure amounted to fifty thousand pounds?\u201d</p><p>Jamie squinted at his reflection in the rounded side of the decanter, considering. Then he picked it up and refilled his glass, to assist thought.</p><p>\u201cNot as metal, no. But did ye notice the prices that some of those coins in Mayer\u2019s catalogue have sold for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as a thousand pound\u2014sterling!\u2014for a moldy bit of metal!\u201d he said, marveling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think metal molds,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I take your point. Anyway,\u201d I said, dismissing the question with a wave of my hand, \u201cthe point here is this; do you suppose the seals\u2019 treasure could have been the fifty thousand pounds that the Duke had promised to the Stuarts?\u201d</p><p>In the early days of 1744, when Charles Stuart had been in France, trying to persuade his royal cousin Louis to grant him some sort of support, he had received a ciphered offer from the Duke of Sandringham, of fifty thousand pounds\u2014enough to hire a small army\u2014on condition that he enter England to retake the throne of his ancestors.</p><p>Whether it had been this offer that finally convinced the vacillating Prince Charles to undertake his doomed excursion, we would never know. It might as easily have been a challenge from someone he was drinking with, or a slight\u2014real or imagined\u2014by his mistress, that had sent him to Scotland with nothing more than six companions, two thousand Dutch broadswords, and several casks of brandywine with which to charm the Highland chieftains.</p><p>In any case, the fifty thousand pounds had never been received, because the Duke had died before Charles reached England. Another of the speculations that troubled me on sleepless nights was the question of whether that money would have made a difference. If Charles Stuart had received it, would he have taken his ragged Highland army all the way to London, retaken the throne and regained his father\u2019s crown?</p><p>If he had\u2014well, if he had, the Jacobite rebellion might have succeeded, Culloden might not have happened, I should never have gone back through the circle of stone...and I and Brianna would likely both have died in childbed and been dust these many years past. Surely twenty years should have been enough to teach me the futility of \u201cif.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had been considering, meditatively rubbing the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been,\u201d he said at last. \u201cGiven a proper market for the coins and gems\u2014ye ken such things take time to sell; if ye must dispose of them quickly, you\u2019ll get but a fraction of the price. But given long enough to search out good buyers\u2014aye, it might reach fifty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuncan Kerr was a Jacobite, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned, nodding. \u201cHe was. Aye, it could be\u2014though God knows it\u2019s an awkward kind of fortune to be handing to the commander of an army to pay his troops!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s also small, portable, and easy to hide,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cAnd if you were the Duke, and busy committing treason by dealing with the Stuarts, that might be important to you. Sending fifty thousand pounds in sterling, with strongboxes and carriages and guards, would attract the hell of a lot more attention than sending one man secretly across the Channel with a small wooden box.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded again. \u201cLikewise, if ye had a collection of such rarities already, it would attract no attention to be acquiring more, and no one would likely notice what coins ye had. It would be a simple matter to take out the most valuable, replace them with cheap ones, and no one the wiser. No banker who might talk, were ye to shift money or land.\u201d He shook his head admiringly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clever scheme, aye, whoever made it.\u201d He looked up inquiringly at me.</p><p>\u201cBut then, why did Duncan Kerr come, nearly ten years after Culloden? And what happened to him? Did he come to leave the fortune on the silkies\u2019 isle then, or to take it away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who sent the Bruja now?\u201d I finished for him. I shook my head, too.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know. Perhaps the Duke had a confederate of some sort? But if he did, we don\u2019t know who it was.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed, and impatient with sitting for so long, stood up and stretched. He glanced out the window, estimating the height of the sun, his usual method of telling time, whether a clock was handy or not.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, we\u2019ll have time for speculation once we\u2019re at sea. It\u2019s near on noon, now, and the Paris coach leaves at three o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>The apothecary\u2019s shop in the Rue de Varennes was gone. In its place were a thriving tavern, a pawnbroker\u2019s, and a small goldsmith\u2019s shop, crammed companionably cheek by jowl.</p><p>\u201cMaster Raymond?\u201d The pawnbroker knitted grizzled brows. \u201cI have heard of him, Madame\u201d\u2014he darted a wary glance at me, suggesting that whatever he had heard had not been very admirable\u2014\u201cbut he has been gone for several years. If you are requiring a good apothecary, though, Krasner in the Place d\u2019Aloes, or perhaps Madame Verrue, near the Tuileries...\u201d He stared with interest at Mr. Willoughby, who accompanied me, then leaned over the counter to address me confidentially.</p><p>\u201cMight you be interested in selling your Chinaman, Madame? I have a client with a marked taste for the Orient. I could get you a very good price\u2014with no more than the usual commission, I assure you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mr. Willoughby, who did not speak French, was peering with marked contempt at a porcelain jar painted with pheasants, done in an Oriental style.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I think not. I\u2019ll try Krasner.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby had attracted relatively little attention in Le Havre, a port city teeming with foreigners of every description. On the streets of Paris, wearing a padded jacket over his blue-silk pajamas, and with his queue wrapped several times around his head for convenience, he caused considerable comment. He did, however, prove surprisingly knowledgeable about herbs and medicinal substances.</p><p>\u201cBai jei ai,\u201d he told me, picking up a pinch of mustard seed from an open box in Krasner\u2019s emporium. \u201cGood for shen-yen\u2014kidneys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>He allowed his head to roll slightly from side to side, as I had learned was his habit when pleased at being able to astonish someone.</p><p>\u201cI know healers one time,\u201d was all he said, though, before turning to point at a basket containing what looked like balls of dried mud.</p><p>\u201cShan-y\u00fc,\u201d he said authoritatively. \u201cGood\u2014very good\u2014cleanse blood, liver he work good, no dry skin, help see. You buy.\u201d</p><p>I stepped closer to examine the objects in question and found them to be a particularly homely sort of dried eel, rolled into balls and liberally coated with mud. The price was quite reasonable, though, so to please him, I added two of the nasty things to the basket over my arm.</p> <p>The weather was mild for early December, and we walked back toward Jared\u2019s house in the Rue Tremoulins. The streets were bright with winter sunshine, and lively with vendors, beggars, prostitutes, shopgirls, and the other denizens of the poorer part of Paris, all taking advantage of the temporary thaw.</p><p>At the corner of the Rue du Nord and the All\u00e9e des Canards, though, I saw something quite out of the ordinary; a tall, slope-shouldered figure in black frock coat and a round black hat.</p><p>\u201cReverend Campbell!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>He whirled about at being so addressed, then, recognizing me, bowed and removed his hat.</p><p>\u201cMistress Malcolm!\u201d he said. \u201cHow most agreeable to see you again.\u201d His eye fell on Mr. Willoughby, and he blinked, features hardening in a stare of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cEr...this is Mr. Willoughby,\u201d I introduced him. \u201cHe\u2019s an...associate of my husband\u2019s. Mr. Willoughby, the Reverend Archibald Campbell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d The Reverend Campbell normally looked quite austere, but contrived now to look as though he had breakfasted on barbed wire, and found it untasty.</p><p>\u201cI thought that you were sailing from Edinburgh to the West Indies,\u201d I said, in hopes of taking his gelid eye off the Chinaman. It worked; his gaze shifted to me, and thawed slightly.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your kind inquiries, Madame,\u201d he said. \u201cI still harbor such intentions. However, I had urgent business to transact first in France. I shall be departing from Edinburgh on Thursday week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how is your sister?\u201d I asked. He glanced at Mr. Willoughby with dislike, then taking a step to one side so as to be out of the Chinaman\u2019s direct sight, lowered his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe is somewhat improved, I thank you. The draughts you prescribed have been most helpful. She is much calmer, and sleeps quite regularly now. I must thank you again for your kind attentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d I said. \u201cI hope the voyage will agree with her.\u201d We parted with the usual expressions of good will, and Mr. Willoughby and I walked down the Rue du Nord, back toward Jared\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cReverend meaning most holy fella, not true?\u201d Mr. Willoughby said, after a short silence. He had the usual Oriental difficulty in pronouncing the letter \u201cr,\u201d which made the word \u201cReverend\u201d more than slightly picturesque, but I gathered his meaning well enough.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I said, glancing down at him curiously. He pursed his lips and pushed them in and out, then grunted in a distinctly amused manner.</p> <p>\u201cNot so holy, that Reverend fella,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say so?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a bright-eyed glance, full of shrewdness.</p><p>\u201cI see him one time, Madame Jeanne\u2019s. Not loud talking then. Very quiet then, Reverend fella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I turned to look back, but the Reverend\u2019s tall figure had disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cStinking whores,\u201d Mr. Willoughby amplified, making an extremely rude gesture in the vicinity of his crotch in illustration.</p><p>\u201cYes, I gathered,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, I suppose the flesh is weak now and then, even for Scottish Free Church ministers.\u201d</p><p>At dinner that night, I mentioned seeing the Reverend, though without adding Mr. Willoughby\u2019s remarks about the Reverend\u2019s extracurricular activities.</p><p>\u201cI ought to have asked him where in the West Indies he was going,\u201d I said. \u201cNot that he\u2019s a particularly scintillating companion, but it might be useful to know someone there.\u201d</p><p>Jared, who was consuming veal patties in a businesslike way, paused to swallow, then said, \u201cDinna trouble yourself about that, my dear. I\u2019ve made up a list for you of useful acquaintances. I\u2019ve written letters for ye to carry to several friends there, who will certainly lend ye assistance.\u201d</p><p>He cut another sizable chunk of veal, wiped it through a puddle of wine sauce, and chewed it, while looking thoughtfully at Jamie.</p><p>Having evidently come to a decision of some kind, he swallowed, took a sip of wine, and said in a conversational voice, \u201cWe met on the level, Cousin.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in bewilderment, but Jamie, after a moment\u2019s pause, replied, \u201cAnd we parted on the square.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s narrow face broke into a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s a help!\u201d he said. \u201cI wasna just sure, aye? but I thought it worth the trial. Where were ye made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn prison,\u201d Jamie replied briefly. \u201cIt will be the Inverness lodge, though.\u201d</p><p>Jared nodded in satisfaction. \u201cAye, well enough. There are lodges on Jamaica and Barbados\u2014I\u2019ll have letters for ye to the Masters there. But the largest lodge is on Trinidad\u2014better than two thousand members there. If ye should need great help in finding the lad, that\u2019s where ye must ask. Word of everything that happens in the islands comes through that lodge, sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care to tell me what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>Jamie glanced at me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cFreemasons, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Mason?\u201d I blurted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not meant to,\u201d Jared said, a bit sharply. \u201cThe rites of Freemasonry are secret, known only to the members. I wouldna have been able to give Jamie an introduction to the Trinidad lodge, had he not been one of us already.\u201d</p><p>The conversation became general again, as Jamie and Jared fell to discussing the provisioning of the Artemis, but I was quiet, concentrating on my own veal. The incident, small as it was, had reminded me of all the things I didn\u2019t know about Jamie. At one time, I should have said I knew him as well as one person can know another.</p><p>Now, there would be moments, talking intimately together, falling asleep in the curve of his shoulder, holding him close in the act of love, when I felt I knew him still, his mind and heart as clear to me as the lead crystal of the wineglasses on Jared\u2019s table.</p><p>And others, like now, when I would stumble suddenly over some unsuspected bit of his past, or see him standing still, eyes shrouded with recollections I didn\u2019t share. I felt suddenly unsure and alone, hesitating on the brink of the gap between us.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s foot pressed against mine under the table, and he looked across at me with a smile hidden in his eyes. He raised his glass a little, in a silent toast, and I smiled back, feeling obscurely comforted. The gesture brought back a sudden memory of our wedding night, when we had sat beside each other sipping wine, strangers frightened of each other, with nothing between us but a marriage contract\u2014and the promise of honesty.</p><p>There are things ye maybe canna tell me, he had said. I willna ask ye, or force ye. But when ye do tell me something, let it be the truth. There is nothing between us now but respect, and respect has room for secrets, I think\u2014but not for lies.</p><p>I drank deeply from my own glass, feeling the strong bouquet of the wine billow up inside my head, and a warm flush heat my cheeks. Jamie\u2019s eyes were still fixed on me, ignoring Jared\u2019s soliloquy about ship\u2019s biscuit and candles. His foot nudged mine in silent inquiry, and I pressed back in answer.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll see to it in the morning,\u201d he said, in reply to a question from Jared. \u201cBut for now, Cousin, I think I shall retire. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d He pushed back his chair, stood up, and held out his arm to me.</p><p>\u201cWill ye join me, Claire?\u201d</p><p>I stood up, the wine rushing through my limbs, making me feel warm all over and slightly giddy. Our eyes met with a perfect understanding. There was more than respect between us now, and room for all our secrets to be known, in good time.</p><p>In the morning, Jamie and Mr. Willoughby went with Jared, to complete their errands. I had another errand of my own\u2014one that I preferred to do alone. Twenty years ago, there had been two people in Paris whom I cared for deeply. Master Raymond was gone; dead or disappeared. The chances that the other might still be living were slim, but still, I had to see, before I left Europe for what might be the last time. With my heart beating erratically, I stepped into Jared\u2019s coach, and told the coachman to drive to the H\u00f4pital des Anges.</p><p>The grave was set in the small cemetery reserved for the convent, under the buttresses of the nearby cathedral. Even though the air from the Seine was damp and cold, and the day cloudy, the walled cemetery held a soft light, reflected from the blocks of pale limestone that sheltered the small plot from wind. In the winter, there were no shrubs or flowers growing, but leafless aspens and larches spread a delicate tracery against the sky, and a deep green moss cradled the stones, thriving despite the cold.</p><p>It was a small stone, made of a soft white marble. A pair of cherub\u2019s wings spread out across the top, sheltering the single word that was the stone\u2019s only other decoration. \u201cFaith,\u201d it read.</p><p>I stood looking down at it until my vision blurred. I had brought a flower; a pink tulip\u2014not the easiest thing to find in Paris in December, but Jared kept a conservatory. I knelt down and laid it on the stone, stroking the soft curve of the petal with a finger, as though it were a baby\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t cry,\u201d I said a little later.</p><p>I felt the weight of Mother Hildegarde\u2019s hand on my head.</p><p>\u201cLe Bon Dieu orders things as He thinks best,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut He seldom tells us why.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and wiped my cheeks with a corner of my cloak. \u201cIt was a long time ago, though.\u201d I rose slowly to my feet and turned to find Mother Hildegarde watching me with an expression of deep sympathy and interest.</p><p>\u201cI have noticed,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cthat time does not really exist for mothers, with regard to their children. It does not matter greatly how old the child is\u2014in the blink of an eye, the mother can see the child again as it was when it was born, when it learned to walk, as it was at any age\u2014at any time, even when the child is fully grown and a parent itself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEspecially when they\u2019re asleep,\u201d I said, looking down again at the little white stone. \u201cYou can always see the baby then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Mother nodded, satisfied. \u201cI thought you had had more children; you have the look, somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more.\u201d I glanced at her. \u201cAnd how do you know so much about mothers and children?\u201d</p><p>The small black eyes shone shrewdly under heavy brow ridges whose sparse hairs had gone quite white.</p> <p>\u201cThe old require very little sleep,\u201d she said, with a deprecatory shrug. \u201cI walk the wards at night, sometimes. The patients talk to me.\u201d</p><p>She had shrunk somewhat with advancing age, and the wide shoulders were slightly bowed, thin as a wire hanger beneath the black serge of her habit. Even so, she was still taller than I, and towered over most of the nuns, more scarecrow-like, but imposing as ever. She carried a walking stick but strode erect, firm of tread and with the same piercing eye, using the stick more frequently to prod idlers or direct underlings than to lean on.</p><p>I blew my nose and we turned back along the path to the convent. As we walked slowly back, I noticed other small stones set here and there among the larger ones.</p><p>\u201cAre those all children?\u201d I asked, a little surprised.</p><p>\u201cThe children of the nuns,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. I gaped at her in astonishment, and she shrugged, elegant and wry as always.</p> <p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d she said. She walked a few steps farther, then added, \u201cNot often, of course.\u201d She gestured with her stick around the confines of the cemetery.</p><p>\u201cThis place is reserved for the sisters, a few benefactors of the H\u00f4pital\u2014and those they love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sisters or the benefactors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sisters. Here, you lump!\u201d</p><p>Mother Hildegarde paused in her progress, spotting an orderly leaning idly against the church wall, smoking a pipe. As she berated him in the elegantly vicious Court French of her girlhood, I stood back, looking around the tiny cemetery.</p><p>Against the far wall, but still in consecrated ground, was a row of small stone tablets, each with a single name, \u201cBouton.\u201d Below each name was a Roman numeral, I through XV. Mother Hildegarde\u2019s beloved dogs. I glanced at her current companion, the sixteenth holder of that name. This one was coal-black, and curly as a Persian lamb. He sat bolt upright at her feet, round eyes fixed on the delinquent orderly, a silent echo of Mother Hildegarde\u2019s outspoken disapproval.</p> <p>The sisters, and those they love.</p><p>Mother Hildegarde came back, her fierce expression altering at once to the smile that transformed her strong gargoyle features into beauty.</p><p>\u201cI am so pleased that you have come again, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d she said. \u201cCome inside; I shall find things that may be useful to you on your journey.\u201d Tucking the stick in the crook of her arm, she instead took my forearm for support, grasping it with a warm bony hand whose skin had grown paperthin. I had the odd feeling that it was not I who supported her, but the other way around.</p><p>As we turned into the small yew alley that led to the entrance to the H\u00f4pital, I glanced up at her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you won\u2019t think me rude, Mother,\u201d I said hesitantly, \u201cbut there is one question I wanted to ask you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighty-three,\u201d she replied promptly. She grinned broadly, showing her long yellow horse\u2019s teeth. \u201cEveryone wants to know,\u201d she said complacently. She looked back over her shoulder toward the tiny graveyard, and lifted one shoulder in a dismissive Gallic shrug.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cLe Bon Dieu knows how much work there is still to do.\u201d</p><p>41</p> <p>WE SET SAIL</p><p>It was a cold, gray day\u2014there is no other kind in Scotland in December\u2014when the Artemis touched at Cape Wrath, on the northwest coast.</p><p>I peered out of the tavern window into a solid gray murk that hid the cliffs along the shore. The place was depressingly reminiscent of the landscape near the silkies\u2019 isle, with the smell of dead seaweed strong in the air, and the crashing of waves so loud as to inhibit conversation, even inside the small pothouse by the wharf. Young Ian had been taken nearly a month before. Now it was past Christmas, and here we were, still in Scotland, no more than a few miles from the seals\u2019 island.</p><p>Jamie was striding up and down the dock outside, in spite of the cold rain, too restless to stay indoors by the fire. The sea journey from France back to Scotland had been no better for him than the first Channel crossing, and I knew the prospect of two or three months aboard the Artemis filled him with dread. At the same time, his impatience to be in pursuit of the kidnappers was so acute that any delay filled him with frustration. More than once I had awakened in the middle of the night to find him gone, walking the streets of Le Havre alone.</p><p>Ironically, this final delay was of his own making. We had touched at Cape Wrath to retrieve Fergus, and with him, the small group of smugglers whom Jamie had sent him to fetch, before leaving ourselves for Le Havre.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no telling what we shall find in the Indies, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie had explained to me. \u201cI dinna mean to go up against a shipload of pirates singlehanded, nor yet to fight wi\u2019 men I dinna ken alongside me.\u201d The smugglers were all men of the shore, accustomed to boats and the ocean, if not to ships; they would be hired on as part of the Artemis\u2019s crew, shorthanded in consequence of the late season in which we sailed.</p><p>Cape Wrath was a small port, with little traffic at this time of year. Besides the Artemis, only a few fishing boats and a ketch were tied up at the wooden wharf. There was a small pothouse, though, in which the crew of the Artemis cheerfully passed their time while waiting, the men who would not fit inside the house crouching under the eaves, swilling pots of ale passed through the windows by their comrades indoors. Jamie walked on the shore, coming in only for meals, when he would sit before the fire, the wisps of steam rising from his soggy garments symptomatic of his increasing aggravation of soul.</p><p>Fergus was late. No one seemed to mind the wait but Jamie and Jared\u2019s captain. Captain Raines, a small, plump, elderly man, spent most of his time on the deck of his ship, keeping one weather eye on the overcast sky, and the other on his barometer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s verra strong-smelling stuff, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie observed, during one of his brief visits to the taproom. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh ginger,\u201d I answered, holding up the remains of the root I was grating. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing most of my herbals say is best for nausea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d He picked up the bowl, sniffed at the contents, and sneezed explosively, to the vast amusement of the onlookers. I snatched back the bowl before he could spill it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t take it like snuff,\u201d I said. \u201cYou drink it in tea. And I hope to heaven it works, because if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll be scooping you out of the bilges, if bilges are what I think they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not to worry, missus,\u201d one of the older hands assured me, overhearing. \u201cLots o\u2019 green hands feel a bit queerlike the first day or two. But usually they comes round soon enough; by the third day, they\u2019ve got used to the pitch and roll, and they\u2019re up in the rigging, happy as larks.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jamie, who was markedly unlarklike at the moment. Still, this comment seemed to give him some hope, for he brightened a bit, and waved to the harassed servingmaid for a glass of ale.</p><p>\u201cIt may be so,\u201d he said. \u201cJared said the same; that seasickness doesna generally last more than a few days, provided the seas aren\u2019t too heavy.\u201d He took a small sip of his ale, and then, with growing confidence, a deeper swallow. \u201cI can stand three days of it, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>Late in the afternoon of the second day, six men appeared, winding their way along the stony shore on shaggy Highland ponies.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Raeburn in the lead,\u201d Jamie said, shading his eyes and squinting to distinguish the identities of the six small dots. \u201cKennedy after him, then Innes\u2014he\u2019s missing the left arm, see?\u2014and Meldrum, and that\u2019ll be MacLeod with him, they always ride together like that. Is the last man Gordon, then, or Fergus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be Gordon,\u201d I said, peering over his shoulder at the approaching men, \u201cbecause it\u2019s much too fat to be Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the devil is Fergus, then?\u201d Jamie asked Raeburn, once the smugglers had been greeted, introduced to their new shipmates, and sat down to a hot supper and a cheerful glass.</p><p>Raeburn bobbed his head in response, hastily swallowing the remains of his pasty.</p><p>\u201cWeel, he said to me as how he\u2019d some business to see to, and would I see to the hiring of the horses, and speak to Meldrum and MacLeod about coming, for they were out wi\u2019 their own boat at the time, and not expected back for a day or twa more, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat business?\u201d Jamie said sharply, but got no more than a shrug in reply. Jamie muttered something under his breath in Gaelic, but returned to his own supper without further comment.</p><p>The crew being now complete\u2014save Fergus\u2014preparations began in the morning for getting under way. The deck was a scene of organized confusion, with bodies darting to and fro, popping up through hatchways, and dropping suddenly out of the rigging like dead flies. Jamie stood near the wheel, keeping out of the way, but lending a hand whenever a matter requiring muscle rather than skill arose. For the most part, though, he simply stood, eyes fixed on the road along the shore.</p><p>\u201cWe shall have to sail by midafternoon, or miss the tide.\u201d Captain Raines spoke kindly, but firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have surly weather in twenty-four hours; the glass is falling, and I feel it in my neck.\u201d The Captain tenderly massaged the part in question, and nodded at the sky, which had gone from pewter to lead-gray since early morning. \u201cI\u2019ll not set sail in a storm if I can help it, and if we mean to make the Indies as soon as possible\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I understand, Captain,\u201d Jamie interrupted him. \u201cOf course; ye must do as seems best.\u201d He stood back to let a bustling seaman go past, and the Captain disappeared, issuing orders as he went.</p><p>As the day wore on, Jamie seemed composed as usual, but I noticed that the stiff fingers fluttered against his thigh more and more often, the only outward sign of worry. And worried he was. Fergus had been with him since the day twenty years before, when Jamie had found him in a Paris brothel, and hired him to steal Charles Stuart\u2019s letters.</p><p>More than that; Fergus had lived at Lallybroch since before Young Ian was born. The boy had been a younger brother to Fergus, and Jamie the closest thing to a father that Fergus had ever known. I could not imagine any business so urgent that it would have kept him from Jamie\u2019s side. Neither could Jamie, and his fingers beat a silent tattoo on the wood of the rail.</p><p>Then it was time, and Jamie turned reluctantly away, tearing his eyes from the empty shore. The hatches were battened, the lines coiled, and several seamen leapt ashore to cast free the mooring hawsers; there were six of them, each a rope as thick around as my wrist.</p><p>I put a hand on Jamie\u2019s arm in silent sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come down below,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a spirit lamp. I\u2019ll brew you some hot ginger tea, and then you\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sound of a galloping horse echoed along the shore, the scrunch of hoofbeats on gravel echoing from the cliffside well in advance of its appearance.</p><p>\u201cThere he is, the wee fool,\u201d Jamie said, his relief evident in voice and body. He turned to Captain Raines, one brow raised in question. \u201cThere\u2019s enough of the tide left? Aye, then, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCast off!\u201d the Captain bellowed, and the waiting hands sprang into action. The last of the lines tethering us to the piling was slipped free and neatly coiled, and all around us, lines tightened and sails snapped overhead, as the bosun ran up and down the deck, bawling orders in a voice like rusty iron.</p><p>\u201cShe moves! She stirs! \u2018She seems to feel / the thrill of life along her keel\u2019!\u201d I declaimed, delighted to feel the deck quiver beneath my feet as the ship came alive, the energy of all the crew poured into its inanimate hulk, transmuted by the power of the wind-catching sails.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d said Jamie hollowly, feeling the same thing. He grasped the rail, closed his eyes and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Willoughby says he has a cure for seasickness,\u201d I said, watching him sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d he said, opening his eyes. \u201cI ken what he means, and if he thinks I\u2019ll let him\u2014what the bloody hell!\u201d</p><p>I whirled to look, and saw what had caused him to break off. Fergus was on deck, reaching up to help down a girl perched awkwardly above him on the railing, her long blond hair whipping in the wind. Laoghaire\u2019s daughter\u2014Marsali MacKimmie.</p><p>Before I could speak, Jamie was past me and striding toward the pair.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the name of holy God d\u2019ye mean by this, ye wee coofs?\u201d he was demanding, by the time I made my way into earshot through the obstacle course of lines and seamen. He loomed menacingly over the pair, a foot taller than either of them.</p><p>\u201cWe are married,\u201d Fergus said, bravely moving in front of Marsali. He looked both scared and excited, his face pale beneath the shock of black hair.</p><p>\u201cMarried!\u201d Jamie\u2019s hands clenched at his sides, and Fergus took an involuntary step backward, nearly treading on Marsali\u2019s toes. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye mean, \u2018married\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I assumed this was a rhetorical question, but it wasn\u2019t; Jamie\u2019s appreciation of the situation had, as usual, outstripped mine by yards and seized at once upon the salient point.</p><p>\u201cHave ye bedded her?\u201d he demanded bluntly. Standing behind him, I couldn\u2019t see his face, but I knew what it must look like, if only because I could see the effect of his expression on Fergus. The Frenchman turned a couple of shades paler and licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cEr...no, milord,\u201d he said, just as Marsali, eyes blazing, thrust her chin up and said defiantly, \u201cYes, he has!\u201d</p> <p>Jamie glanced briefly back and forth between the two of them, snorted loudly, and turned away.</p><p>\u201cMr. Warren!\u201d he called down the deck to the ship\u2019s sailing master. \u201cPut back to the shore, if ye please!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Warren stopped, openmouthed, in the middle of an order addressed to the rigging, and stared, first at Jamie, then\u2014quite elaborately\u2014at the receding shoreline. In the few moments since the appearance of the putative newlyweds, the Artemis had moved more than a thousand yards from the shore, and the rocks of the cliffs were slipping by with increasing speed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe he can,\u201d I said. \u201cI think we\u2019re already in the tide-race.\u201d</p><p>No sailor himself, Jamie had spent sufficient time in the company of seamen at least to understand the notion that time and tide wait for no one. He breathed through his teeth for a moment, then jerked his head toward the ladder that led belowdecks.</p><p>\u201cCome down, then, the both of ye.\u201d</p><p>Fergus and Marsali sat together in the tiny cabin, huddled on one berth, hands clutched tight. Jamie waved me to a seat on the other berth, then turned to the pair, hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this nonsense of bein\u2019 married?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is true, milord,\u201d Fergus said. He was quite pale, but his dark eyes were bright with excitement. His one hand tightened on Marsali\u2019s, his hook resting across his thigh.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie said, with the maximum of skepticism. \u201cAnd who married ye?\u201d</p><p>The two glanced at each other, and Fergus licked his lips briefly before replying.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014we are handfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore witnesses,\u201d Marsali put in. In contrast to Fergus\u2019s paleness, a high color burned in her cheeks. She had her mother\u2019s roseleaf skin, but the stubborn set of her jaw had likely come from somewhere else. She put a hand to her bosom, where something crackled under the fabric. \u201cI ha\u2019 the contract, and the signatures, here.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a low growling noise in his throat. By the laws of Scotland, two people could in fact be legally married by clasping hands before witnesses\u2014handfasting\u2014and declaring themselves to be man and wife.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut ye\u2019re no bedded, yet, and a contract\u2019s not enough, in the eyes o\u2019 the Church.\u201d He glanced out of the stern casement, where the cliffs were just visible through the ragged mist, then nodded with decision.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop at Lewes for the last provisions. Marsali will go ashore there; I\u2019ll send two seamen to see her home to her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll do no such thing!\u201d Marsali cried. She sat up straight, glaring at her stepfather. \u201cI\u2019m going wi\u2019 Fergus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you\u2019re not, my lassie!\u201d Jamie snapped. \u201cD\u2019ye have no feeling for your mother? To run off, wi\u2019 no word, and leave her to be worrit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left word.\u201d Marsali\u2019s square chin was high. \u201cI sent a letter from Inverness, saying I\u2019d married Fergus and was off to sail wi\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet bleeding Jesus! She\u2019ll think I kent all about it!\u201d Jamie looked horror-stricken.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014I\u2014did ask the lady Laoghaire for the honor of her daughter\u2019s hand, milord,\u201d Fergus put in. \u201cLast month, when I came to Lallybroch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, ye needna tell me what she said,\u201d Jamie said dryly, seeing the sudden flush on Fergus\u2019s cheeks. \u201cSince I gather the general answer was no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said he was a bastard!\u201d Marsali burst out indignantly. \u201cAnd a criminal, and\u2014and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a bastard and a criminal,\u201d Jamie pointed out. \u201cAnd a cripple wi\u2019 no property, either, as I\u2019m sure your mother noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna care!\u201d Marsali gripped Fergus\u2019s hand and looked at him with fierce affection. \u201cI want him.\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, Jamie rubbed a finger across his lips. Then he took a deep breath and returned to the attack.</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d he said, \u201cye\u2019re too young to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fifteen; that\u2019s plenty old enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and he\u2019s thirty!\u201d Jamie snapped. He shook his head, \u201cNay, lassie, I\u2019m sorry about it, but I canna let ye do it. If it were nothing else, the voyage is too dangerous\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking her!\u201d Marsali\u2019s chin jerked contemptuously in my direction.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave Claire out of this,\u201d Jamie said evenly. \u201cShe\u2019s none of your concern, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s not? You leave my mother for this English whore, and make her a laughingstock for the whole countryside, and it\u2019s no my concern, is it?\u201d Marsali leapt up and stamped her foot on the deck. \u201cAnd you ha\u2019 the hellish nerve to tell me what I shall do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Jamie said, keeping hold of his temper with some difficulty. \u201cMy private affairs are not your concern\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine aren\u2019t any of yours!\u201d</p><p>Fergus, looking alarmed, was on his feet, trying to calm the girl.</p><p>\u201cMarsali, ma ch\u00e8re, you must not speak to milord in such a way. He is only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to him any way I want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not!\u201d Surprised at the sudden harshness in Fergus\u2019s tone, Marsali blinked. Only an inch or two taller than his new wife, the Frenchman had a certain wiry authority that made him seem much bigger than he was.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said more softly. \u201cSit down, ma p\u2019tite.\u201d He pressed her back down on the berth, and stood before her.</p><p>\u201cMilord has been to me more than a father,\u201d he said gently to the girl. \u201cI owe him my life a thousand times. He is also your stepfather. However your mother may regard him, he has without doubt supported and sheltered her and you and your sister. You owe him respect, at the least.\u201d</p><p>Marsali bit her lip, her eyes bright. Finally she ducked her head awkwardly at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured, and the air of tension in the cabin lessened slightly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, lassie,\u201d Jamie said gruffly. He looked at her and sighed. \u201cBut still, Marsali, we must send ye back to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d The girl was calmer now, but the set of her pointed chin was the same. She glanced at Fergus, then at Jamie. \u201cHe says we havena bedded together, but we have. Or at any rate, I shall say we have. If ye send me home, I\u2019ll tell everyone that he\u2019s had me; so ye see\u2014I shall either be married or ruined.\u201d Her tone was reasonable and determined. Jamie closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay the Lord deliver me from women,\u201d he said between his teeth. He opened his eyes and glared at her.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re married. But you\u2019ll do it right, before a priest. We\u2019ll find one in the Indies, when we land. And until ye\u2019ve been blessed, Fergus doesna touch you. Aye?\u201d He turned a ferocious gaze on both of them.</p><p>\u201cYes, milord,\u201d said Fergus, his features suffused with joy. \u201cMerci beaucoup!\u201d Marsali narrowed her eyes at Jamie, but seeing that he wasn\u2019t to be moved, she bowed her head demurely, with a sidelong glance at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d she said.</p><p>The question of Fergus\u2019s elopement had at least distracted Jamie\u2019s mind temporarily from the motion of the ship, but the palliative effect didn\u2019t last. He held on grimly nevertheless, turning greener by the moment, but refusing to leave the deck and go below, so long as the shore of Scotland was in sight.</p><p>\u201cI may never see it again,\u201d he said gloomily, when I tried to persuade him to go below and lie down. He leaned heavily on the rail he had just been vomiting over, eyes resting longingly on the unprepossessingly bleak coast behind us.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll see it,\u201d I said, with an unthinking surety. \u201cYou\u2019re coming back. I don\u2019t know when, but I know you\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to look up at me, puzzled. Then the ghost of a smile crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my grave,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHaven\u2019t ye?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, but he didn\u2019t seem upset, and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. He closed his eyes, breathing heavily. \u201cDon\u2019t...don\u2019t tell me when, though, if ye dinna mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any dates on it. Just your name\u2014and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d His eyes popped open.</p><p>I nodded again, feeling my throat tighten at the memory of that granite slab. It had been what they call a \u201cmarriage stone,\u201d a quarter-circle carved to fit with another in a complete arch. I had, of course, seen only the one half.</p><p>\u201cIt had all your names on it. That\u2019s how I knew it was you. And underneath, it said, \u2018Beloved husband of Claire.\u2019 At the time, I didn\u2019t see how\u2014but now, of course, I do.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded slowly, absorbing it. \u201cAye, I see. Aye well, I suppose if I shall be in Scotland, and still married to you\u2014then maybe \u2018when\u2019 doesna matter so much.\u201d He gave me a shadow of his usual grin, and added wryly, \u201cIt also means we\u2019ll find Young Ian safe, for I\u2019ll tell ye, Sassenach, I willna set foot in Scotland again without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him,\u201d I said, with an assurance I didn\u2019t altogether feel. I put a hand on his shoulder and stood beside him, watching Scotland slowly recede in the distance.</p><p>By the time evening set in, the rocks of Scotland had disappeared in the sea mists, and Jamie, chilled to the bone and pale as a sheet, suffered himself to be led below and put to bed. At this point, the unforeseen consequences of his ultimatum to Fergus became apparent.</p><p>There were only two small private cabins, besides the Captain\u2019s; if Fergus and Marsali were forbidden to share one until their union was formally blessed, then clearly Jamie and Fergus would have to take one, and Marsali and I the other. It seemed destined to be a rough voyage, in more ways than one.</p><p>I had hoped that the sickness might ease, if Jamie couldn\u2019t see the slow heave and fall of the horizon, but no such luck.</p> <p>\u201cAgain?\u201d said Fergus, sleepily rousing on one elbow in his berth, in the middle of the night. \u201cHow can he? He has eaten nothing all day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him that,\u201d I said, trying to breathe through my mouth as I sidled toward the door, a basin in my hands, making my way with difficulty through the tiny, cramped quarters. The deck rose and fell beneath my unaccustomed feet, making it hard to keep my balance.</p><p>\u201cHere, milady, allow me.\u201d Fergus swung bare feet out of bed and stood up beside me, staggering and nearly bumping into me as he reached for the basin.</p><p>\u201cYou should go and sleep now, milady,\u201d he said, taking it from my hands. \u201cI will see to him, be assured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d The thought of my berth was undeniably tempting. It had been a long day.</p><p>\u201cGo, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said. His face was a ghastly white, sheened with sweat in the dim light of the small oil light that burned on the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p> <p>This was patently untrue; at the same time, it was unlikely that my presence would help particularly. Fergus could do the little that could be done; there was no known cure for seasickness, after all. One could only hope that Jared was right, and that it would ease of itself as the Artemis made its way out into the longer swells of the Atlantic.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, giving in. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll feel better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Jamie opened one eye for a moment, then groaned, and shivering, closed it again.</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps I\u2019ll be dead,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>On that cheery note, I made my way out into the dark companionway, only to stumble over the prostrate form of Mr. Willoughby, curled up against the door of the cabin. He grunted in surprise, then, seeing that it was only me, rolled slowly onto all fours and crawled into the cabin, swaying with the rolling of the ship. Ignoring Fergus\u2019s exclamation of distate, he curled himself about the pedestal of the table, and fell promptly back asleep, an expression of beatific content on his small round face.</p><p>My own cabin was just across the companionway, but I paused for a moment, to breathe in the fresh air coming down from the deck above. There was an extraordinary variety of noises, from the creak and crack of timbers all around, to the snap of sails and the whine of rigging above, and the faint echo of a shout somewhere on deck.</p><p>Despite the racket and the cold air pouring in down the companionway, Marsali was sound asleep, a humped black shape in one of the two berths. Just as well; at least I needn\u2019t try to make awkward conversation with her.</p><p>Despite myself, I felt a pang of sympathy for her; this was likely not what she had expected of her wedding night. It was too cold to undress; fully clothed, I crawled into my small box-berth and lay listening to the sounds of the ship around me. I could hear the hissing of the water passing the hull, only a foot or two beyond my head. It was an oddly comforting sound. To the accompaniment of the song of the wind and the faint sound of retching across the corridor, I fell peacefully asleep.</p> <p>The Artemis was a tidy ship, as ships go, but when you cram thirty-two men\u2014and two women\u2014into a space eighty feet long and twenty-five wide, together with six tons of rough-cured hides, forty-two barrels of sulfur, and enough sheets of copper and tin to sheathe the Queen Mary, basic hygiene is bound to suffer.</p><p>By the second day, I had already flushed a rat\u2014a small rat, as Fergus pointed out, but still a rat\u2014in the hold where I went to retrieve my large medicine box, packed away there by mistake during the loading. There was a soft shuffling noise in my cabin at night, which when the lantern was lit proved to be the footsteps of several dozen middling-size cockroaches, all fleeing frantically for the shelter of the shadows.</p><p>The heads, two small quarter-galleries on either side of the ship toward the bow, were nothing more than a pair of boards\u2014with a strategic slot between them\u2014suspended over the bounding waves eight feet below, so that the user was likely to get an unexpected dash of cold seawater at some highly inopportune moment. I suspected that this, coupled with a diet of salt pork and hardtack, likely caused constipation to be epidemic among seamen.</p><p>Mr. Warren, the ship\u2019s master, proudly informed me that the decks were swabbed regularly every morning, the brass polished, and everything generally made shipshape, which seemed a desirable state of affairs, given that we were in fact aboard a ship. Still, all the holystoning in the world could not disguise the fact that thirty-four human beings occupied this limited space, and only one of us bathed.</p><p>Given such circumstances, I was more than startled when I opened the door of the galley on the second morning, in search of boiling water.</p><p>I had expected the same dim and grubby conditions that obtained in the cabins and holds, and was dazzled by the glitter of sunlight through the overhead lattice on a rank of copper pans, so scrubbed that the metal of their bottoms shone pink. I blinked against the dazzle, my eyes adjusting, and saw that the walls of the galley were solid with built-in racks and cupboards, so constructed as to be proof against the roughest seas.</p><p>Blue and green glass bottles of spice, each tenderly jacketed in felt against injury, vibrated softly in their rack above the pots. Knives, cleavers, and skewers gleamed in deadly array, in a quantity sufficient to deal with a whale carcass, should one present itself. A rimmed double shelf hung from the bulkhead, thick with bulb glasses and shallow plates, on which a quantity of fresh-cut turnip tops were set to sprout for greens. An enormous pot bubbled softly over the stove, emitting a fragrant steam. And in the midst of all this spotless splendor stood the cook, surveying me with baleful eye.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, as cordially as possible. \u201cMy name is Claire Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d he repeated, in the same graveled tones.</p><p>\u201cI am Mrs. Fraser, the wife of the supercargo, and ship\u2019s surgeon for this voyage,\u201d I said, giving him eyeball for eyeball. \u201cI require six gallons of boiling water, when convenient, for cleaning of the head.\u201d</p><p>His small, bright blue eyes grew somewhat smaller and brighter, the black pupils of them training on me like gunbarrels.</p><p>\u201cI am Aloysius O\u2019Shaughnessy Murphy,\u201d he said. \u201cShip\u2019s cook. And I require ye to take yer feet off my fresh-washed deck. I do not allow women in my galley.\u201d He glowered at me under the edge of the black cotton kerchief that swathed his head. He was several inches shorter than I, but made up for it by measuring about three feet more in circumference, with a wrestler\u2019s shoulders and a head like a cannonball, set upon them without apparent benefit of an intervening neck. A wooden leg completed the ensemble.</p><p>I took one step back, with dignity, and spoke to him from the relative safety of the passageway.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d I said, \u201cyou may send up the hot water by the messboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd then again, I may not.\u201d He turned his broad back on me in dismissal, busying himself with a chopping block, a cleaver, and a joint of mutton.</p><p>I stood in the passageway for a moment, thinking. The thud of the cleaver sounded regularly against the wood. Mr. Murphy reached up to his spice rack, grasped a bottle without looking, and sprinkled a good quantity of the contents over the diced meat. The dusty scent of sage filled the air, superseded at once by the pungency of an onion, whacked in two with a casual swipe of the cleaver and tossed into the mixture.</p><p>Evidently the crew of the Artemis did not subsist entirely upon salt pork and hardtack, then. I began to understand the reasons for Captain Raines\u2019s rather pear-shaped physique. I poked my head back through the door, taking care to stand outside.</p><p>\u201cCardamom,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cNutmeg, whole. Dried this year. Fresh extract of anise. Ginger root, two large ones, with no blemishes.\u201d I paused. Mr. Murphy had stopped chopping, cleaver poised motionless above the block.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d I added, \u201chalf a dozen whole vanilla beans. From Ceylon.\u201d</p><p>He turned slowly, wiping his hands upon his leather apron. Unlike his surroundings, neither the apron nor his other apparel was spotless.</p><p>He had a broad, florid face, edged with stiff sandy whiskers like a scrubbing brush, which quivered slightly as he looked at me, like the antennae of some large insect. His tongue darted out to lick pursed lips.</p><p>\u201cSaffron?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cHalf an ounce,\u201d I said promptly, taking care to conceal any trace of triumph in my manner.</p><p>He breathed in deeply, lust gleaming bright in his small blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll find a mat just outside, ma\u2019am, should ye care to wipe yer boots and come in.\u201d</p><p>One head sterilized within the limits of boiling water and Fergus\u2019s tolerance, I made my way back to my cabin to clean up for luncheon. Marsali was not there; she was undoubtedly attending to Fergus, whose labors at my insistence had been little short of heroic.</p><p>I rinsed my own hands with alcohol, brushed my hair, and then went across the passage to see whether\u2014by some wild chance\u2014Jamie wanted anything to eat or drink. One glance disabused me of this notion.</p><p>Marsali and I had been given the largest cabin, which meant that each of us had approximately six square feet of space, not including the beds. These were box-berths, a sort of enclosed bed built into the wall, about five and a half feet long. Marsali fitted neatly into hers, but I was forced to adopt a slightly curled position, like a caper on toast, which caused me to wake up with pins and needles in my feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie and Fergus had similar berths. Jamie was lying on his side, wedged into one of these like a snail into its shell; one of which beasts he strongly resembled at the moment, being a pale and viscid gray in color, with streaks of green and yellow that contrasted nastily with his red hair. He opened one eye when he heard me come in, regarded me dimly for a moment, and closed it again.</p><p>\u201cNot so good, hm?\u201d I said sympathetically.</p><p>The eye opened again, and he seemed to be preparing to say something. He opened his mouth, changed his mind, and closed it again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and shut the eye once more.</p> <p>I tentatively smoothed his hair, but he seemed too sunk in misery to notice.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Raines says it will likely be calmer by tomorrow,\u201d I offered. The sea wasn\u2019t terribly rough as it was, but there was a noticeable rise and fall.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna matter,\u201d he said, not opening his eyes. \u201cI shall be dead by then\u2014or at least I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not,\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cNobody dies of seasickness; though I must say it seems a wonder that they don\u2019t, looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d He opened his eyes, and struggled up on one elbow, an effort that left him clammy with sweat and white to the lips.</p> <p>\u201cClaire. Be careful. I should have told ye before\u2014but I didna want to worry ye, and I thought\u2014\u201d His face changed. Familiar as I was with expressions of bodily infirmity, I had the basin there just in time.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d He lay limp and exhausted, pale as the sheet.</p><p>\u201cWhat should you have told me?\u201d I asked, wrinkling my nose as I put the basin on the floor near the door. \u201cWhatever it was, you should have told me before we sailed, but it\u2019s too late to think of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didna think it would be so bad,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou never do,\u201d I said, rather tartly. \u201cWhat did you want to tell me, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Fergus,\u201d he said. \u201cSay I said he must tell ye. And tell him Innes is all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I was mildly alarmed; delirium wasn\u2019t a common effect of seasickness.</p><p>His eyes opened, and fixed on mine with great effort. Beads of sweat stood out on his brow and upper lip.</p><p>\u201cInnes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe canna be the one. He doesna mean to kill me.\u201d</p><p>A small shiver ran up my spine.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite all right, Jamie?\u201d I asked. I bent and wiped his face, and he gave me the ghost of an exhausted smile. He had no fever, and his eyes were clear.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said carefully, with a sudden feeling that there were eyes fixed on my back. \u201cWho does mean to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d A passing spasm contorted his features, but he clamped his lips tight, and managed to subdue it.</p><p>\u201cAsk Fergus,\u201d he whispered, when he could talk again. \u201cIn private. He\u2019ll tell ye.\u201d</p> <p>I felt exceedingly helpless. I had no notion what he was talking about, but if there was any danger, I wasn\u2019t about to leave him alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait until he comes down,\u201d I said.</p><p>One hand was curled near his nose. It straightened slowly and slid under the pillow, coming out with his dirk, which he clasped to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI shall be all right,\u201d he said. \u201cGo on, then, Sassenach. I shouldna think they\u2019d try anything in daylight. If at all.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t find this reassuring in the slightest, but there seemed nothing else to do. He lay quite still, the dirk held to his chest like a stone tomb-figure.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he murmured again, his lips barely moving.</p><p>Just outside the cabin door, something stirred in the shadows at the end of the passage. Peering sharply, I made out the crouched silk shape of Mr. Willoughby, chin resting on his knees. He spread his knees apart, and bowed his head politely between them.</p><p>\u201cNot worry, honorable First Wife,\u201d he assured me in a sibilant whisper. \u201cI watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, \u201ckeep doing it.\u201d And went, in considerable distress of mind, to find Fergus.</p><p>Fergus, found with Marsali on the after deck, peering into the ship\u2019s wake at several large white birds, was somewhat more reassuring.</p><p>\u201cWe are not sure that anyone intends actually to kill milord,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe casks in the warehouse might have been an accident\u2014I have seen such things happen more than once\u2014and likewise the fire in the shed, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait one minute, young Fergus,\u201d I said, gripping him by the sleeve. \u201cWhat casks, and what fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, looking surprised. \u201cMilord did not tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilord is sick as a dog, and incapable of telling me anything more than that I should ask you.\u201d</p><p>Fergus shook his head, clicking his tongue in a censorious French way.</p><p>\u201cHe never thinks he will be so ill,\u201d he said. \u201cHe always is, and yet every time he must set foot on a ship, he insists that it is only a matter of will; his mind will be master, and he will not allow his stomach to be dictating his actions. Then within ten feet of the dock, he has turned green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never told me that,\u201d I said, amused at this description. \u201cStubborn little fool.\u201d</p><p>Marsali had been hanging back behind Fergus with an air of haughty reserve, pretending that I wasn\u2019t there. At this unexpected description of Jamie, though, she was surprised into a brief snort of laughter. She caught my eye and turned hastily away, cheeks flaming, to stare out to sea.</p><p>Fergus smiled and shrugged. \u201cYou know what he is like, milady,\u201d he said, with tolerant affection. \u201cHe could be dying, and one would never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d know if you went down and looked at him now,\u201d I said tartly. At the same time, I was conscious of surprise, accompanied by a faint feeling of warmth in the pit of my stomach. Fergus had been with Jamie almost daily for twenty years, and still Jamie would not admit to him the weakness that he would readily let me see. Were he dying, I would know about it, all right.</p><p>\u201cMen,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cMilady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were telling me about casks and fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed, yes.\u201d Fergus brushed back his thick shock of black hair with his hook. \u201cIt was the day before I met you again, milady, at Madame Jeanne\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The day I had returned to Edinburgh, no more than a few hours before I had found Jamie at the printshop. He had been at the Burntisland docks with Fergus and a gang of six men during the night, taking advantage of the late dawn of winter to retrieve several casks of unbonded Madeira, smuggled in among a shipment of innocent flour.</p><p>\u201cMadeira does not soak through the wood so quickly as some other wines do,\u201d Fergus explained. \u201cYou cannot bring in brandy under the noses of the Customs like that, for the dogs will smell it at once, even if their masters do not. But not Madeira, provided it has been freshly casked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the Customs inspectors have dogs, milady, trained to smell out such contraband as tobacco and brandy.\u201d He waved away the interruption, squinting his eyes against the brisk sea wind.</p><p>\u201cWe had removed the Madeira safely, and brought it to the warehouse\u2014one of those belonging apparently to Lord Dundas, but in fact it belongs jointly to milord and Madame Jeanne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said, again with that minor dip of the stomach I had felt when Jamie opened the door of the brothel on Queen Street. \u201cPartners, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of a sort.\u201d Fergus sounded regretful. \u201cMilord has only a five percent share, in return for his finding the place, and making the arrangements. Printing as an occupation is much less profitable than keeping a h\u00f4tel de joie.\u201d Marsali didn\u2019t look round, but I thought her shoulders stiffened further.</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d I said. Edinburgh and Madame Jeanne were a long way behind us, after all. \u201cGet on with the story. Someone may cut Jamie\u2019s throat before I find out why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, milady.\u201d Fergus bobbed his head apologetically.</p><p>The contraband had been safely hidden, awaiting disguise and sale, and the smugglers had paused to refresh themselves with a drink in lieu of breakfast, before making their way home in the brightening dawn. Two of the men had asked for their shares at once, needing the money to pay gaming debts and buy food for their families. Jamie agreeing to this, he had gone across to the warehouse office, where some gold was kept.</p><p>As the men relaxed over their whisky in a corner of the warehouse, their joking and laughter was interrupted by a sudden vibration that shook the floor beneath their feet.</p><p>\u201cCome-down!\u201d shouted MacLeod, an experienced warehouseman, and the men had dived for cover, even before they had seen the great rack of hogsheads near the office quiver and rumble, one two-ton cask rolling down the stack with ponderous grace, to smash in an aromatic lake of ale, followed within seconds by a cascade of its monstrous fellows.</p><p>\u201cMilord was crossing in front of the rank,\u201d Fergus said, shaking his head. \u201cIt was only by the grace of the Blessed Virgin herself that he was not crushed.\u201d A bounding cask had missed him by inches, in fact, and he had escaped another only by diving headfirst out of its way and under an empty wine-rack that had deflected its course.</p><p>\u201cAs I say, such things happen often,\u201d Fergus said, shrugging. \u201cA dozen men are killed each year in such accidents, in the warehouses near Edinburgh alone. But with the other things...\u201d</p><p>The week before the incident of the casks, a small shed full of packing straw had burst into flames while Jamie was working in it. A lantern placed between him and the door had apparently fallen over, setting the straw alight and trapping Jamie in the windowless shed, behind a sudden wall of flame.</p><p>\u201cThe shed was fortunately of a most flimsy construction, and the boards half-rotted. It went up like matchwood, but milord was able to kick a hole in the back wall and crawl out, with no injury. We thought at first that the lantern had merely fallen of its own accord, and were most grateful for his escape. It was only later that milord told me he thought that he had heard a noise\u2014perhaps a shot, perhaps only the cracking noises an old warehouse makes as its boards settle\u2014and when he turned to see, found the flames shooting up before him.\u201d</p><p>Fergus sighed. He looked rather tired, and I wondered whether perhaps he had stayed awake to stand watch over Jamie during the night.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, shrugging once more. \u201cWe do not know. Such incidents may have been no more than accident\u2014they may not. But taking such occurrences together with what happened at Arbroath\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have a traitor among the smugglers,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cJust so, milady.\u201d Fergus scratched his head. \u201cBut what is more disturbing to milord is the man whom the Chinaman shot at Madame Jeanne\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you think he was a Customs agent, who\u2019d tracked Jamie from the docks to the brothel? Jamie said he couldn\u2019t be, because he had no warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot proof,\u201d Fergus noted. \u201cBut worse, the booklet he had in his pocket.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe New Testament?\u201d I saw no particular relevance to that, and said so.</p><p>\u201cOh, but there is, milady\u2014or might be, I should say,\u201d Fergus corrected himself. \u201cYou see, the booklet was one that milord himself had printed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cor at least I\u2019m beginning to.\u201d</p><p>Fergus nodded gravely. \u201cTo have the Customs trace brandy from the points of delivery to the brothel would be bad, of course, but not fatal\u2014another hiding place could be found; in fact, milord has arrangements with the owners of two taverns that...but that is of no matter.\u201d He waved it away. \u201cBut to have the agents of the Crown connect the notorious smuggler Jamie Roy with the respectable Mr. Malcolm of Carfax Close...\u201d He spread his hands wide. \u201cYou see?\u201d</p> <p>I did. Were the Customs to get too close to his smuggling operations, Jamie could merely disperse his assistants, cease frequenting his smugglers\u2019 haunts, and disappear for a time, retreating into his guise as a printer until it seemed safe to resume his illegal activities. But to have his two identities both detected and merged was not only to deprive him of both his sources of income, but to arouse such suspicion as might lead to discovery of his real name, his seditious activities, and thence to Lallybroch and his history as rebel and convicted traitor. They would have evidence to hang him a dozen times\u2014and once was enough.</p><p>\u201cI certainly do see. So Jamie wasn\u2019t only worried about Laoghaire and Hobart MacKenzie, when he told Ian he thought it would be as well for us to skip to France for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Paradoxically, I felt somewhat relieved by Fergus\u2019s revelations. At least I hadn\u2019t been single-handedly responsible for Jamie\u2019s exile. My reappearance might have precipitated the crisis with Laoghaire, but I had had nothing to do with any of this.</p><p>\u201cExactly, milady. And still, we do not know for certain that one of the men has betrayed us\u2014or whether, even if there should be a traitor among them, he should wish to kill milord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a point.\u201d It was, but not a large one. If one of the smugglers had undertaken to betray Jamie for money, that was one thing. If it was for some motive of personal vengeance, though, the man might well feel compelled to take matters into his own hands, now that we were\u2014temporarily, at least\u2014out of reach of the King\u2019s Customs.</p> <p>\u201cIf so,\u201d Fergus was continuing, \u201cit will be one of six men\u2014the six milord sent me to collect, to sail with us. These six were present both when the casks fell, and when the shed caught fire; all have been to the brothel.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd all of them were present on the road at Arbroath, when we were ambushed, and found the exciseman hanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they all know about the printshop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, milady! Milord has always been most careful to let none of the smuggling men know of that\u2014but it is always possible that one of them shall have seen him on the streets in Edinburgh, followed him to Carfax Close, and so learned of A. Malcolm.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cMilord is not the most inconspicuous of men, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true,\u201d I said, matching his tone. \u201cBut now all of them know Jamie\u2019s real name\u2014Captain Raines calls him Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, with a faint, grim smile. \u201cThat is why we must discover whether we do indeed sail with a traitor\u2014and who it is.\u201d</p><p>Looking at him, it occurred to me for the first time that Fergus was indeed a grown man now\u2014and a dangerous one. I had known him as an eager, squirrel-toothed boy of ten, and to me, something of that boy would always remain in his face. But some time had passed since he had been a Paris street urchin.</p> <p>Marsali had remained staring out to sea during most of this discussion, preferring to take no risk of having to converse with me. She had obviously been listening, though, and now I saw a shiver pass through her thin shoulders\u2014whether of cold or apprehension, I couldn\u2019t tell. She likely hadn\u2019t planned on shipping with a potential murderer when she had agreed to elope with Fergus.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better take Marsali below,\u201d I said to Fergus. \u201cShe\u2019s going blue round the edges. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d I said to Marsali, in a cool voice, \u201cI shan\u2019t be in the cabin for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, milady?\u201d Fergus was squinting at me, slightly suspicious. \u201cMilord will not wish you to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI\u2019m going to the galley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe galley?\u201d His fine black brows shot up.</p><p>\u201cTo see whether Aloysius O\u2019Shaughnessy Murphy has anything to suggest for seasickness,\u201d I said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get Jamie back on his feet, he isn\u2019t going to care whether anyone cuts his throat or not.\u201d</p><p>Murphy, sweetened by an ounce of dried orange peel and a bottle of Jared\u2019s best claret, was quite willing to oblige. In fact, he seemed to consider the problem of keeping food in Jamie\u2019s stomach something of a professional challenge, and spent hours in mystic contemplation of his spice rack and pantries\u2014all to no avail.</p><p>We encountered no storms, but the winter winds drove a heavy swell before them, and the Artemis rose and fell ten feet at a time, laboring up and down the great glassy peaks of the waves. There were times, watching the hypnotic rise and lurch of the taffrail against the horizon, when I felt a few interior qualms of my own, and turned hastily away.</p> <p>Jamie showed no signs of being about to fulfill Jared\u2019s heartening prophecy and spring to his feet, suddenly accustomed to the motion. He remained in his berth, the color of rancid custard, moving only to stagger to the head, and guarded in turns day and night by Mr. Willoughby and Fergus.</p><p>On the positive side of things, none of the six smugglers made any move that might be considered threatening. All expressed a sympathetic concern for Jamie\u2019s welfare, and\u2014carefully watched\u2014all had visited him briefly in his cabin, with no suspicious circumstances attending.</p><p>For my part, I spent the days in exploring the ship, attending to such small medical emergencies as arose from the daily business of sailing\u2014a smashed finger, a cracked rib, bleeding gums and an abscessed tooth\u2014and pounding herbs and making medicines in a corner of the galley, allowed to work there by Murphy\u2019s grace.</p><p>Marsali was absent from our shared cabin when I rose, already asleep when I returned to it, and silently hostile when the cramped confines of shipboard forced us to meet on deck or over meals. I assumed that the hostility was in part the result of her natural feelings for her mother, and in part the result of frustration over passing her night hours in my company, rather than Fergus\u2019s.</p><p>For that matter, if she remained untouched\u2014and judging from her sullen demeanor, I was reasonably sure she did\u2014it was owing entirely to Fergus\u2019s respect for Jamie\u2019s dictates. In terms of his role as guardian of his stepdaughter\u2019s virtue, Jamie himself was a negligible force at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWot, not the broth, too?\u201d Murphy said. The cook\u2019s broad red face lowered menacingly. \u201cWhich I\u2019ve had folk rise from their deathbeds after a sup of that broth!\u201d</p><p>He took the pannikin of broth from Fergus, sniffed at it critically, and thrust it under my nose.</p><p>\u201cHere, smell that, missus. Marrow bones, garlic, caraway seed, and a lump o\u2019 pork fat to flavor, all strained careful through muslin, same as some folks bein\u2019 poorly to their stomachs can\u2019t abide chunks, but chunks you\u2019ll not find there, not a one!\u201d</p><p>The broth was in fact a clear golden brown, with an appetizing smell that made my own mouth water, despite the excellent breakfast I had made less than an hour before. Captain Raines had a delicate stomach, and in consequence had taken some pains both in the procurement of a cook and the provisioning of the galley, to the benefit of the officers\u2019 table.</p><p>Murphy, with a wooden leg and the general dimensions of a rum cask, looked the picture of a thoroughgoing pirate, but in fact had a reputation as the best sea-cook in Le Havre\u2014as he had told me himself, without the least boastfulness. He considered cases of seasickness a challenge to his skill, and Jamie, still prostrate after four days, was a particular affront to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s wonderful broth,\u201d I assured him. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he can\u2019t keep anything down.\u201d</p><p>Murphy grunted dubiously, but turned and carefully poured the remains of the broth into one of the numerous kettles that steamed day and night over the galley fire.</p><p>Scowling horribly and running one hand through the wisps of his scanty blond hair, he opened a cupboard and closed it, then bent to rummage through a chest of provisions, muttering under his breath.</p><p>\u201cA bit o\u2019 hardtack, maybe?\u201d he muttered. \u201cDry, that\u2019s what\u2019s wanted. Maybe a whiff o\u2019 vinegar, though; tart pickle, say...\u201d</p><p>I watched in fascination as the cook\u2019s huge, sausage-fingered hands flicked deftly through the stock of provisions, plucking dainties and assembling them swiftly on a tray.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Ere, let\u2019s try this, then,\u201d he said, handing me the finished tray. \u201cLet \u2019im suck on the pickled gherkins, but don\u2019t let \u2019im bite \u2019em yet. Then follow on with a bite of the plain hardtack\u2014there ain\u2019t no weevils in it yet, I don\u2019t think\u2014but see as he don\u2019t drink water with it. Then a bite of gherkin, well-chewed, to make the spittle flow, a bite of hardtack, and so to go on with. That much stayin\u2019 down, then, we can proceed to the custard; which it\u2019s fresh-made last evening for the Captain\u2019s supper. Then if that sticks...\u201d His voice followed me out of the galley, continuing the catalogue of available nourishment. \u201c...milk toast, which it\u2019s made with goat\u2019s milk, and fresh-milked, too...</p><p>\u201c...syllabub beat up well with whisky and a nice egg...\u201d boomed down the passageway as I negotiated the narrow turn with the loaded tray, carefully stepping over Mr. Willoughby, who was as usual crouched in a corner of the passage by Jamie\u2019s door like a small blue lapdog.</p><p>One step inside the cabin, though, I could see that the exercise of Murphy\u2019s culinary skill was going to be once again in vain. In the usual fashion of a man feeling unwell, Jamie had managed to arrange his surroundings to be as depressing and uncomfortable as possible. The tiny cabin was dank and squalid, the cramped berth covered with a cloth so as to exclude both light and air, and half-piled with a tangle of clammy blankets and unwashed clothes.</p><p>\u201cRise and shine,\u201d I said cheerfully. I set down the tray and pulled off the makeshift curtain, which appeared to be one of Fergus\u2019s shirts. What light there was came from a large prism embedded in the deck overhead. It struck the berth, illuminating a countenance of ghastly pallor and baleful mien.</p><p>He opened one eye an eighth of an inch.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he said, and shut it again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought you some breakfast,\u201d I said firmly.</p><p>The eye opened again, coldly blue and gelid.</p><p>\u201cDinna mention the word \u2018breakfast\u2019 to me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCall it luncheon then,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s late enough.\u201d I pulled up a stool next to him, picked a gherkin from the tray, and held it invitingly under his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to suck on it,\u201d I told him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly, the other eye opened. He said nothing, but the pair of blue orbs swiveled around, resting on me with an expression of such ferocious eloquence that I hastily withdrew the pickle.</p><p>The eyelids drooped slowly shut once more.</p><p>I surveyed the wreckage, frowning. He lay on his back, his knees drawn up. While the built-in berth provided more stability for the sleeper than the crews\u2019 swinging hammocks, it was designed to accommodate the usual run of passengers, who\u2014judging from the size of the berth\u2014were assumed to be no more than a modest five feet three or so.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be at all comfortable in there,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to try a hammock instead? At least you could stretch\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain says he requires a list of the cargo from you\u2014at your convenience.\u201d</p><p>He made a brief and unrepeatable suggestion as to what Captain Raines might do with his list, not bothering to open his eyes.</p> <p>I sighed, and picked up his unresisting hand. It was cold and damp, and his pulse was fast.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said after a pause. \u201cPerhaps we could try something I used to do with surgical patients. It seemed to help sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He gave a low groan, but didn\u2019t object. I pulled up a stool and sat down, still holding his hand.</p><p>I had developed the habit of talking with the patients for a few minutes before they were taken to surgery. My presence seemed to reassure them, and I had found that if I could fix their attention on something beyond the impending ordeal, they seemed to do better\u2014there was less bleeding, the postanesthetic nausea was less, and they seemed to heal better. I had seen it happen often enough to believe that it was not imagination; Jamie hadn\u2019t been altogether wrong when assuring Fergus that the power of mind over flesh was possible.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think of something pleasant,\u201d I said, pitching my voice to be as low and soothing as possible. \u201cThink of Lallybroch, of the hillside above the house. Think of the pine trees there\u2014can you smell the needles? Think of the smoke coming up from the kitchen chimney on a clear day, and an apple in your hand. Think about how it feels in your hand, all hard and smooth, and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSassenach?\u201d Both Jamie\u2019s eyes were open, and fixed on me in intense concentration. Sweat gleamed in the hollow of his temples.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he repeated, very gently, \u201cor I shall break your neck. Go away now.\u201d</p><p>I rose with dignity and went out.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby was leaning against an upright in the passage, peering thoughtfully into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have those stone balls with you, do you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered, looking surprised. \u201cWanting healthy balls for Tseimi?\u201d He began to fumble in his sleeve, but I stopped him with a gesture.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I want to do is bash him on the head with them, but I suppose Hippocrates would frown on that.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby smiled uncertainly and bobbed his head several times in an effort to express appreciation of whatever I thought I meant.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. I glared back over my shoulder at the heap of reeking bedclothes. It stirred slightly, and a groping hand emerged, patting gingerly around the floor until it found the basin that stood there. Grasping this, the hand disappeared into the murky depths of the berth, from which presently emerged the sound of dry retching.</p><p>\u201cBloody man!\u201d I said, exasperation mingled with pity\u2014and a slight feeling of alarm. The ten hours of a Channel crossing were one thing; what would his state be like after two months of this?</p><p>\u201cHead of pig,\u201d Mr. Willoughby agreed, with a lugubrious nod. \u201cHe is rat, you think, or maybe dragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe smells like a whole zoo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy dragon, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne is born in Year of Dragon, Year of Rat, Year of Sheep, Year of Horse,\u201d Mr. Willoughby explained. \u201cBeing different, each year, different people. You are knowing is Tsei-mi rat, or dragon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean which year was he born in?\u201d I had vague memories of the menus in Chinese restaurants, decorated with the animals of the Chinese zodiac, with explanations of the supposed character traits of those born in each year. \u201cIt was 1721, but I don\u2019t know offhand which animal that was the year of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking rat,\u201d said Mr. Willoughby, looking thoughtfully at the tangle of bedclothes, which were heaving in a mildly agitated manner. \u201cRat very clever, very lucky. But dragon, too, could be. He is most lusty in bed, Tsei-mi? Dragons most passionate people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so as you would notice lately,\u201d I said, watching the heap of bed-clothes out of the corner of my eye. It heaved upward and fell back, as though the contents had turned over suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI have Chinese medicine,\u201d Mr. Willoughby said, observing this phenomenon thoughtfully. \u201cGood for vomit, stomach, head, all making most peaceful and serene.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him with interest. \u201cReally? I\u2019d like to see that. Have you tried it on Jamie yet?\u201d</p><p>The little Chinese shook his head regretfully.</p><p>\u201cNot want,\u201d he replied. \u201cSay damn-all, throwing overboard if I am come near.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby and I looked at each other with a perfect understanding.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, raising my voice a decibel or two, \u201cprolonged dry retching is very bad for a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, most bad, yes.\u201d Mr. Willoughby had shaved the forward part of his skull that morning; the bald curve shone as he nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cIt erodes the stomach tissues, and irritates the esophagus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite so. It raises the blood pressure and strains the abdominal muscles, too. Can even tear them, and cause a hernia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d I continued, raising my voice just a trifle, \u201cit can cause the testicles to become tangled round each other inside the scrotum, and cuts off the circulation there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d Mr. Willoughby\u2019s eyes went round.</p><p>\u201cIf that happens,\u201d I said ominously, \u201cthe only thing to do, usually, is to amputate before gangrene sets in.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby made a hissing sound indicative of understanding and deep shock. The heap of bedclothes, which had been tossing to and fro in a restless manner during this conversation, was quite still.</p><p>I looked at Mr. Willoughby. He shrugged. I folded my arms and waited. After a minute, a long foot, elegantly bare, was extruded from the bedclothes. A moment later, its fellow joined it, resting on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDamn the pair of ye,\u201d said a deep Scottish voice, in tones of extreme malevolence. \u201cCome in, then.\u201d</p><p>Fergus and Marsali were leaning over the aft rail, cozily shoulder to shoulder, Fergus\u2019s arm about the girl\u2019s waist, her long fair hair fluttering in the wind.</p><p>Hearing approaching footsteps, Fergus glanced back over his shoulder. Then he gasped, whirled round, and crossed himself, eyes bulging.</p><p>\u201cNot...one...word, if ye please,\u201d Jamie said between clenched teeth.</p><p>Fergus opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Marsali, turning to look too, emitted a shrill scream.</p><p>\u201cDa! What\u2019s happened to ye?\u201d</p><p>The obvious fright and concern in her face stopped Jamie from whatever acerbic remark he had been about to make. His face relaxed slightly, making the slender gold needles that protruded from behind his ears twitch like ant\u2019s feelers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s only some rubbish of the Chinee\u2019s, to cure the puking.\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, Marsali came up to him, gingerly extending a finger to touch the needles embedded in the flesh of his wrist below the palm. Three more flashed from the inside of his leg, a few inches above the ankle.</p><p>\u201cDoes\u2014does it work?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched, his normal sense of humor beginning to reassert itself.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a bloody ill-wish doll that someone\u2019s been poking full o\u2019 pins,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I havena vomited in the last quarter-hour, so I suppose it must work.\u201d He shot a quick glare at me and Mr. Willoughby, standing side by side near the rail.</p><p>\u201cMind ye,\u201d he said, \u201cI dinna feel like sucking on gherkins just yet, but I could maybe go so far as to relish a glass of ale, if ye mind where some might be found, Fergus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh, yes, milord. If you will come with me?\u201d Unable to refrain from staring, Fergus reached out a tentative hand to take Jamie\u2019s arm, but thinking better of it, turned in the direction of the after gangway.</p><p>\u201cShall I tell Murphy to start cooking your luncheon?\u201d I called after Jamie as he turned to follow Fergus. He gave me a long, level look over one shoulder. The golden needles sprouted through his hair in twin bunches, gleaming in the morning light like a pair of devil\u2019s horns.</p><p>\u201cDinna try me too high, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no going to forget, ye ken. Tangled testicles\u2014pah!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby had been ignoring this exchange, squatting on his heels in the shadow of the aft-deck scuttlebutt, a large barrel filled with water for refreshment of the deck watch. He was counting on his fingers, evidently absorbed in some kind of calculation. As Jamie stalked away, he looked up.</p><p>\u201cNot rat,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNot dragon, too. Tsei-mi born in Year of Ox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, looking after the broad shoulders and red head, lowered stubbornly against the wind. \u201cHow appropriate.\u201d</p><p>42</p><p>THE MAN IN THE MOON</p><p>As his title suggested, Jamie\u2019s job as supercargo was not onerous. Beyond checking the contents of the hold against the bills of lading to insure that the Artemis was in fact carrying the requisite quantities of hides, tin, and sulfur, there was nothing for him to do while at sea. His duties would begin once we reached Jamaica, when the cargo must be unloaded, rechecked, and sold, with the requisite taxes paid, commissions deducted, and paperwork filed.</p><p>In the meantime, there was little for him\u2014or me\u2014to do. While Mr. Picard, the bosun, eyed Jamie\u2019s powerful frame covetously, it was obvious that he would never make a seaman. Quick and agile as any of the crew, his ignorance of ropes and sails made him useless for anything beyond the occasional situation where sheer strength was required. It was plain he was a soldier, not a sailor.</p><p>He did assist with enthusiasm at the gunnery practice that was held every other day, helping to run the four huge guns on their carriages in and out with a tremendous racket, and spending hours in rapt discussion of esoteric cannon lore with Tom Sturgis, the gunner. During these thunderous exercises, Marsali, Mr. Willoughby, and I sat safely out of the way under the care of Fergus, who was excluded from the fireworks because of his missing hand.</p><p>Somewhat to my surprise, I had been accepted as the ship\u2019s surgeon with little question from the crew. It was Fergus who explained that in small merchant ships, even barber-surgeons were uncommon. It was commonly the gunner\u2019s wife\u2014if he had one\u2014who dealt with the small injuries and illnesses of the crew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I saw the normal run of crushed fingers, burnt hands, skin infections, abscessed teeth, and digestive ills, but in a crew of only thirty-two men, there was seldom enough work to keep me busy beyond the hour of sick call each morning.</p><p>In consequence, both Jamie and I had a great deal of free time. And, as the Artemis drew gradually south into the great gyre of the Atlantic, we began to spend most of this time with each other.</p><p>For the first time since my return to Edinburgh, there was time to talk; to relearn all the half-forgotten things we knew of each other, to find out the new facets that experience had polished, and simply to take pleasure in each other\u2019s presence, without the distractions of danger and daily life.</p><p>We strolled the deck constantly, up and down, marking off miles as we conversed of everything and nothing, pointing out to each other the phenomena of a sea voyage; the spectacular sunrises and sunsets, schools of strange green and silver fish, enormous islands of floating seaweed, harboring thousands of tiny crabs and jellyfish, the sleek dolphins that appeared for several days in a row, swimming parallel with the ship, leaping out of the water now and then, as though to get a look at the curious creatures above the water.</p> <p>The moon rose huge and fast and golden, a great glowing disc that slid upward, out of the water and into the sky like a phoenix rising. The water was dark now, and the dolphins invisible, but I thought somehow that they were still there, keeping pace with the ship on her flight through the dark.</p><p>It was a scene breathtaking enough even for the sailors, who had seen it a thousand times, to stop and sigh with pleasure at the sight, as the huge orb rose to hang just over the edge of the world, seeming almost near enough to touch.</p><p>Jamie and I stood close together by the rail, admiring it. It seemed so close that we could make out with ease the dark spots and shadows on its surface.</p><p>\u201cIt seems so close ye could speak to the Man in the Moon,\u201d he said, smiling, and waved a hand in greeting to the dreaming golden face above.</p><p>\u201c\u2018The weeping Pleiads wester / and the moon is under seas,\u2019\u201d I quoted. \u201cAnd look, it is, down there, too.\u201d I pointed over the rail, to where the trail of moonlight deepened, glowing in the water as though a twin of the moon itself were sunken there.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I left,\u201d I said, \u201cmen were getting ready to fly to the moon. I wonder whether they\u2019ll make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo the flying machines go so high, then?\u201d Jamie asked. He squinted at the moon. \u201cI should say it\u2019s a great way, for all it looks so close just now. I read a book by an astronomer\u2014he said it was perhaps three hundred leagues from the earth to the moon. Is he wrong, then, or is it only that the\u2014airplanes, was it?\u2014will fly so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes a special kind, called a rocket,\u201d I said. \u201cActually, it\u2019s a lot farther than that to the moon, and once you get far away from the earth, there\u2019s no air to breathe in space. They\u2019ll have to carry air with them on the voyage, like food and water. They put it in sort of canisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He gazed up, face full of light and wonder. \u201cWhat will it look like there, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures. It\u2019s rocky, and barren, with no life at all\u2014but very beautiful, with cliffs and mountains and craters\u2014you can see the craters from here; the dark spots.\u201d I nodded toward the smiling moon, then smiled at Jamie myself. \u201cIt\u2019s not unlike Scotland\u2014except that it isn\u2019t green.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, then evidently reminded by the word \u201cpictures,\u201d reached into his coat and drew out the little packet of photographs. He was cautious about them, never taking them out where they might be seen by anyone, even Fergus, but we were alone back here, with little chance of interruption.</p> <p>The moon was bright enough to see Brianna\u2019s face, glowing and mutable, as he thumbed slowly through the pictures. The edges were becoming frayed, I saw.</p><p>\u201cWill she walk about on the moon, d\u2019ye think?\u201d he asked softly, pausing at a shot of Bree looking out a window, secretly dreaming, unaware of being photographed. He glanced up again at the orb above us, and I realized that for him, a voyage to the moon seemed very little more difficult or farfetched than the one in which we were engaged. The moon, after all, was only another distant, unknown place.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, smiling a bit.</p><p>He thumbed through the pictures slowly, absorbed as he always was by the sight of his daughter\u2019s face, so like his own. I watched him quietly, sharing his silent joy at this promise of our immortality.</p><p>I thought briefly of that stone in Scotland, engraved with his name, and took comfort from its distance. Whenever our parting might come, chances were it would not be soon. And even when and where it did\u2014Brianna would still be left of us.</p><p>More of Housman\u2019s lines drifted through my head\u2014Halt by the headstone naming / The heart no longer stirred, / And say the lad that loved you / Was one that kept his word.</p><p>I drew close to him, feeling the heat of his body through coat and shirt, and rested my head against his arm as he turned slowly through the small stack of photographs.</p><p>\u201cShe is beautiful,\u201d he murmured, as he did every time he saw the pictures. \u201cAnd clever, too, did ye not say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like her father,\u201d I told him, and felt him chuckle softly.</p><p>I felt him stiffen slightly as he turned one picture over, and lifted my head to see which one he was looking at. It was one taken at the beach, when Brianna was about sixteen. It showed her standing thigh-deep in the surf, hair in a sandy tangle, kicking water at her friend, a boy named Rodney, who was backing away, laughing too, hands held up against the spray of water.</p><p>Jamie frowned slightly, lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d he began. \u201cDo they\u2014\u201d He paused and cleared his throat. \u201cI wouldna venture to criticize, Claire,\u201d he said, very carefully, \u201cbut do ye not think this is a wee bit...indecent?\u201d</p><p>I suppressed an urge to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, composedly. \u201cThat\u2019s really quite a modest bathing suit\u2014for the time.\u201d While the suit in question was a bikini, it was by no means skimpy, rising to at least an inch below Bree\u2019s navel. \u201cI chose this picture because I thought you\u2019d want to er...see as much of her as possible.\u201d</p><p>He looked mildly scandalized at this thought, but his eyes returned to the picture, drawn irresistibly. His face softened as he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, she\u2019s verra lovely, and I\u2019m glad to know it.\u201d He lifted the picture, studying it carefully. \u201cNo, it\u2019s no the thing she\u2019s wearing I meant; most women who bathe outside do it naked, and their skins are no shame to them. It\u2019s only\u2014this lad. Surely she shouldna be standing almost naked before a man?\u201d He scowled at the hapless Rodney, and I bit my lip at the thought of the scrawny little boy, whom I knew very well, as a masculine threat to maidenly purity.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, drawing a deep breath. We were on slightly delicate ground here. \u201cNo. I mean, boys and girls do play together\u2014like that. You know people dress differently then; I\u2019ve told you. No one\u2019s really covered up a great deal except when the weather\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, ye\u2019ve told me.\u201d He managed to convey the distinct impression that on the basis of what I\u2019d told him, he was not impressed with the moral conditions under which his daughter was living.</p><p>He scowled at the picture again, and I thought it was fortunate that neither Bree nor Rodney was present. I had seen Jamie as lover, husband, brother, uncle, laird, and warrior, but never before in his guise as a ferocious Scottish father. He was quite formidable.</p><p>For the first time, I thought that perhaps it was not altogether a bad thing that he wasn\u2019t able to oversee Bree\u2019s life personally; he would have frightened the living daylights out of any lad bold enough to try to court her.</p><p>Jamie blinked at the picture once or twice, then took a deep breath, and I could feel him brace himself to ask.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think she is\u2014a virgin?\u201d The halt in his voice was barely perceptible, but I caught it.</p><p>\u201cOf course she is,\u201d I said firmly. I thought it very likely, in fact, but this wasn\u2019t a situation in which to admit the possibility of doubt. There were things I could explain to Jamie about my own time, but the idea of sexual freedom wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The relief in his voice was inexpressible, and I bit my lip to keep from laughing. \u201cAye, well, I was sure of it, only I\u2014that is\u2014\u201d He stopped and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cBree\u2019s a very good girl,\u201d I said. I squeezed his arm lightly. \u201cFrank and I may not have got on so well together, but we were both good parents to her, if I do say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know ye were. I didna mean to say otherwise.\u201d He had the grace to look abashed, and tucked the beach picture carefully back into the packet. He put the pictures back into his pocket, patting them to be sure they were safe.</p><p>He stood looking up at the moon, then, his brows drew together in a slight frown. The sea wind lifted strands of his hair, tugging them loose from the ribbon that bound it, and he brushed them back absentmindedly. Clearly there was still something on his mind.</p><p>\u201cDo ye think,\u201d he began slowly, not looking at me. \u201cDo ye think that it was quite wise to come to me now, Claire? Not that I dinna want ye,\u201d he added hastily, feeling me stiffen beside him. He caught my hand, preventing my turning away.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didna mean that at all! Christ, I do want ye!\u201d He drew me closer, pressing my hand in his against his heart. \u201cI want ye so badly that sometimes I think my heart will burst wi\u2019 the joy of having ye,\u201d he added more softly. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014Brianna\u2019s alone now. Frank is gone, and you. She has no husband to protect her, no men of her family to see her safely wed. Will she not have need of ye awhile yet? Should ye no have waited a bit, I mean?\u201d</p><p>I paused before answering, trying to get my own feelings under control.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said at last; my voice quivered, in spite of my struggle to control it. \u201cLook\u2014things aren\u2019t the same then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t!\u201d I pulled my hand loose, and glared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, Jamie, and there isn\u2019t any way for me to tell you, because you won\u2019t believe me. But Bree\u2019s a grown woman; she\u2019ll marry when and as she likes, not when someone arranges it for her. She doesn\u2019t need to marry, for that matter. She\u2019s having a good education; she can earn her own living\u2014women do that. She won\u2019t have to have a man to protect her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if there\u2019s no need for a man to protect a woman, and care for her, then I think it will be a verra poor time!\u201d He glared back at me.</p><p>I drew a deep breath, trying to be calm.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say there\u2019s no need for it.\u201d I placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke in a softer tone. \u201cI said, she can choose. She needn\u2019t take a man out of necessity; she can take one for love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His face began to relax, just slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou took me from need,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I came back for love,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think I needed you any less, only because I could feed myself?\u201d</p><p>The lines of his face eased, and the shoulder under my hand relaxed a bit as he searched my face.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI dinna think that.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around me and drew me close. I put my arms around his waist and held him, feeling the small flat patch of Brianna\u2019s pictures in his pocket under my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI did worry about leaving her,\u201d I whispered, a little later. \u201cShe made me go; we were afraid that if I waited longer, I might not be able to find you. But I did worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I shouldna ha\u2019 said anything.\u201d He brushed my curls away from his chin, smoothing them down.</p><p>\u201cI left her a letter,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was all I could think to do\u2014knowing I might...might not see her again.\u201d I pressed my lips tight together and swallowed hard.</p> <p>His fingertips stroked my back, very softly.</p><p>\u201cAye? That was good, Sassenach. What did ye say to her?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, a little shakily.</p><p>\u201cEverything I could think of. Motherly advice and wisdom\u2014what I had of it. All the practical things\u2014where the deed to the house and the family papers were. And everything I knew or could think of, about how to live. I expect she\u2019ll ignore it all, and have a wonderful life\u2014but at least she\u2019ll know I thought about her.\u201d</p><p>It had taken me nearly a week, going through the cupboards and desk drawers of the house in Boston, finding all of the business papers, the bankbooks and mortgage papers and the family things. There were a good many bits and pieces of Frank\u2019s family lying about; huge scrapbooks and dozens of genealogy charts, albums of photographs, cartons of saved letters. My side of the family was a good deal simpler to sum up.</p><p>I lifted down the box I kept on the shelf of my closet. It was a small box. Uncle Lambert was a saver, as all scholars are, but there had been little to save. The essential documents of a small family\u2014birth certificates, mine and my parents\u2019, their marriage lines, the registration for the car that had killed them\u2014what ironic whim had prompted Uncle Lamb to save that? More likely he had never opened the box, but only kept it, in a scholar\u2019s blind faith that information must never be destroyed, for who knew what use it might be, and to whom?</p> <p>I had seen its contents before, of course. There had been a period in my teens when I opened it nightly to look at the few photos it contained. I remembered the bone-deep longing for the mother I didn\u2019t remember, and the vain effort to imagine her, to bring her back to life from the small dim images in the box.</p><p>The best of them was a close-up photograph of her, face turned toward the camera, warm eyes and a delicate mouth, smiling under the brim of a felt cloche hat. The photograph had been hand-tinted; the cheeks and lips were an unnatural rose-pink, the eyes soft brown. Uncle Lamb said that that was wrong; her eyes had been gold, he said, like mine.</p><p>I thought perhaps that time of deep need had passed for Brianna, but was not sure. I had had a studio portrait made of myself the week before; I placed it carefully in the box and closed it, and put the box in the center of my desk, where she would find it. Then I sat down to write.</p><p>My dear Bree\u2014 I wrote, and stopped. I couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t possibly be contemplating abandoning my child. To see those three black words stark on the page brought the whole mad idea into a cold clarity that struck me to the bone.</p><p>My hand shook, and the tip of the pen made small wavering circles in the air above the paper. I put it down, and clasped my hands between my thighs, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip on yourself, Beauchamp,\u201d I muttered. \u201cWrite the bloody thing and have done. If she doesn\u2019t need it, it will do no harm, and if she does, it will be there.\u201d I picked up the pen and began again.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if you will ever read this, but perhaps it\u2019s as well to set it down. This is what I know of your grandparents (your real ones), your great-grandparents, and your medical history...</p><p>I wrote for some time, covering page after page. My mind grew calmer with the effort of recall, and the necessity of setting down the information clearly, and then I stopped, thinking.</p> <p>What could I tell her, beyond those few bare bloodless facts? How to impart what sparse wisdom I had gained in forty-eight years of a fairly eventful life? My mouth twisted wryly in consideration of that. Did any daughter listen? Would I, had my mother been there to tell me?</p><p>It made no difference, though; I would just have to set it down, to be of use if it could.</p><p>But what was true, that would last forever, in spite of changing times and ways, what would stand her in good stead? Most of all, how could I tell her just how much I loved her?</p><p>The enormity of what I was about to do gaped before me, and my fingers clenched tight on the pen. I couldn\u2019t think\u2014not and do this. I could only set the pen to the paper and hope.</p><p>Baby\u2014I wrote, and stopped. Then swallowed hard, and started again.</p><p>You are my baby, and always will be. You won\u2019t know what that means until you have a child of your own, but I tell you now, anyway\u2014you\u2019ll always be as much a part of me as when you shared my body and I felt you move inside. Always.</p><p>I can look at you, asleep, and think of all the nights I tucked you in, coming in the dark to listen to your breathing, lay my hand on you and feel your chest rise and fall, knowing that no matter what happens, everything is right with the world because you are alive.</p><p>All the names I\u2019ve called you through the years\u2014my chick, my pumpkin, precious dove, darling, sweetheart, dinky, smudge...I know why the Jews and Muslims have nine hundred names for God; one small word is not enough for love.</p><p>I blinked hard to clear my vision, and went on writing, fast; I didn\u2019t dare take time to choose my words, or I would never write them.</p><p>I remember everything about you, from the tiny line of golden down that zigged across your forehead when you were hours old to the bumpy toenail on the big toe you broke last year, when you had that fight with Jeremy and kicked the door of his pickup truck.</p><p>God, it breaks my heart to think it will stop now\u2014that watching you, seeing all the tiny changes\u2014I won\u2019t know when you stop biting your nails, if you ever do\u2014seeing you grow suddenly taller than I, and your face take its shape. I always will remember, Bree, I always will.</p><p>There\u2019s probably no one else on earth, Bree, who knows what the back of your ears looked like when you were three years old. I used to sit beside you, reading \u201cOne Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish,\u201d or \u201cThe Three Billy Goats Gruff,\u201d and see those ears turn pink with happiness. Your skin was so clear and fragile, I thought a touch would leave fingerprints on you.</p><p>You look like Jamie, I told you. You have something from me, too, though\u2014look at the picture of my mother, in the box, and the little black-and-white one of her mother and grandmother. You have that broad clear brow they have; so do I. I\u2019ve seen a good many of the Frasers, too\u2014I think you\u2019ll age well, if you take care of your skin.</p><p>Take care of everything, Bree\u2014oh, I wish\u2014well, I have wished I could take care of you and protect you from everything all your life, but I can\u2019t, whether I stay or go. Take care of yourself, though\u2014for me.</p><p>The tears were puckering the paper now; I had to stop to blot them, lest they smear the ink beyond reading. I wiped my face, and resumed, slower now.</p><p>You should know, Bree\u2014I don\u2019t regret it. In spite of everything, I don\u2019t regret it. You\u2019ll know something now, of how lonely I was for so long, without Jamie. It doesn\u2019t matter. If the price of that separation was your life, neither Jamie nor I can regret it\u2014I know he wouldn\u2019t mind my speaking for him.</p><p>Bree...you are my joy. You\u2019re perfect, and wonderful\u2014and I hear you saying now, in that tone of exasperation, \u201cBut of course you think that\u2014you\u2019re my mother!\u201d Yes, that\u2019s how I know.</p><p>Bree, you are worth everything\u2014and more. I\u2019ve done a great many things in my life so far, but the most important of them all was to love your father and you.</p><p>I blew my nose and reached for another fresh sheet of paper. That was the most important thing; I could never say all I felt, but this was the best I could do. What might I add, to be of aid in living well, in growing up and growing old? What had I learned, that I might pass on to her?</p><p>Choose a man like your father, I wrote. Either of them. I shook my head over that\u2014could there be two men more different?\u2014but left it, thinking of Roger Wakefield. Once you\u2019ve chosen a man, don\u2019t try to change him, I wrote, with more confidence. It can\u2019t be done. More important\u2014don\u2019t let him try to change you. He can\u2019t do it either, but men always try.</p><p>I bit the end of the pen, tasting the bitter tang of India ink. And finally I put down the last and the best advice I knew, on growing older.</p><p>Stand up straight and try not to get fat.</p><p>With All My Love Always,</p><p>Mama</p><p>Jamie\u2019s shoulders shook as he leaned against the rail, whether with laughter or some other emotion, I couldn\u2019t tell. His linen glowed white with moonlight, and his head was dark against the moon. At last he turned and pulled me to him.</p><p>\u201cI think she will do verra well,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFor no matter what poor gowk has fathered her, no lass has ever had a better mother. Kiss me, Sassenach, for believe me\u2014I wouldna change ye for the world.\u201d</p><p>43</p><p>PHANTOM LIMBS</p><p>Fergus, Mr. Willoughby, Jamie, and I had all kept careful watch upon the six Scottish smugglers since our departure from Scotland, but there was not the slightest hint of suspicious behavior from any of them, and after a time, I found myself relaxing my wariness around them. Still, I felt some reserve toward most of them, save Innes. I had finally realized why neither Fergus nor Jamie thought him a possible traitor; with but one arm, Innes was the only smuggler who could not have strung up the exciseman on the Arbroath road.</p><p>Innes was a quiet man. None of the Scots was what one might call garrulous, but even by their high standards of taciturnity, he was reserved. I was therefore not surprised to see him grimacing silently one morning, bent over behind a hatch cover, evidently engaged in some silent internal battle.</p><p>\u201cHave you a pain, Innes?\u201d I asked, stopping.</p><p>\u201cOch!\u201d He straightened, startled, but then fell back into his half-crouched position, his one arm locked across his belly. \u201cMmphm,\u201d he muttered, his thin face flushing at being so discovered.</p><p>\u201cCome along with me,\u201d I said, taking him by the elbow. He looked frantically about for salvation, but I towed him, resisting but not audibly protesting, back to my cabin, where I forced him to sit upon the table and removed his shirt so that I could examine him.</p><p>I palpated his lean and hairy abdomen, feeling the firm, smooth mass of the liver on one side, and the mildly distended curve of the stomach on the other. The intermittent way in which the pains came on, causing him to writhe like a worm on a hook, then passing off, gave me a good idea that what troubled him was simple flatulence, but best to be thorough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I probed for the gallbladder, just in case, wondering as I did so just what I would do, should it prove to be an acute attack of cholecystitis or an inflamed appendix. I could envision the cavity of the belly in my mind, as though it lay open in fact before me, my fingers translating the soft, lumpy shapes beneath the skin into vision\u2014the intricate folds of the intestines, softly shielded by their yellow quilting of fat-padded membrane, the slick, smooth lobes of the liver, deep purple-red, so much darker than the vivid scarlet of the heart\u2019s pericardium above. Opening that cavity was a risky thing to do, even equipped with modern anesthetics and antibiotics. Sooner or later, I knew, I would be faced with the necessity of doing it, but I sincerely hoped it would be later.</p><p>\u201cBreathe in,\u201d I said, hands on his chest, and saw in my mind the pink-flushed grainy surface of a healthy lung. \u201cBreathe out, now,\u201d and felt the color fade to soft blue. No rales, no halting, a nice clear flow. I reached for one of the thick sheets of vellum paper I used for stethoscopes.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last move your bowels?\u201d I inquired, rolling the paper into a tube. The Scot\u2019s thin face turned the color of fresh liver. Fixed with my gimlet eye, he mumbled something incoherent, in which the word \u201cfour\u201d was just distinguishable.</p><p>\u201cFour days?\u201d I said, forestalling his attempts to escape by putting a hand on his chest and pinning him flat to the table. \u201cHold still, I\u2019ll just have a listen here, to be sure.\u201d</p> <p>The heart sounds were reassuringly normal; I could hear the valves open and close with their soft, meaty clicks, all in the right places. I was quite sure of the diagnosis\u2014had been virtually from the moment I had looked at him\u2014but by now there was an audience of heads peering curiously round the doorway; Innes\u2019s mates, watching. For effect, I moved the end of my tubular stethoscope down farther, listening for belly sounds.</p><p>Just as I thought, the rumble of trapped gas was clearly audible in the upper curve of the large intestine. The lower sigmoid colon was blocked, though; no sound at all down there.</p><p>\u201cYou have belly gas,\u201d I said, \u201cand constipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken that fine,\u201d Innes muttered, looking frantically for his shirt.</p><p>I put my hand on the garment in question, preventing him from leaving while I catechized him about his diet of late. Not surprisingly, this consisted almost entirely of salt pork and hardtack.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the dried peas and the oatmeal?\u201d I asked, surprised. Having inquired as to the normal fare aboard ship, I had taken the precaution of stowing\u2014along with my surgeon\u2019s cask of lime juice and the collection of medicinal herbs\u2014three hundred pounds of dried peas and a similar quantity of oatmeal, intending that this should be used to supplement the seamen\u2019s normal diet.</p><p>Innes remained tongue-tied, but this inquiry unleashed a flood of revelation and grievance from the onlookers in the doorway.</p><p>Jamie, Fergus, Marsali, and I all dined daily with Captain Raines, feasting on Murphy\u2019s ambrosia, so I was unaware of the deficiencies of the crew\u2019s mess. Evidently the difficulty was Murphy himself, who, while holding the highest culinary standards for the captain\u2019s table, considered the crew\u2019s dinner to be a chore rather than a challenge. He had mastered the routine of producing the crew\u2019s meals quickly and competently, and was highly resistant to any suggestions for an improved menu that might require further time or trouble. He declined absolutely to trouble with such nuisances as soaking peas or boiling oatmeal.</p><p>Compounding the difficulty was Murphy\u2019s ingrained prejudice against oatmeal, a crude Scottish mess that offended his aesthetic sense. I knew what he thought about that, having heard him muttering things about \u201cdog\u2019s vomit\u201d over the trays of breakfast that included the bowls of parritch to which Jamie, Marsali, and Fergus were addicted.</p><p>\u201cMr. Murphy says as how salt pork and hardtack is good enough for every crew he\u2019s had to feed for thirty year\u2014given figgy-dowdy or plum duff for pudding, and beef on Sundays, too\u2014though if that\u2019s beef, I\u2019m a Chinaman\u2014and it\u2019s good enough for us,\u201d Gordon burst in.</p><p>Accustomed to polyglot crews of French, Italian, Spanish, and Norwegian sailors, Murphy was also accustomed to having his meals accepted and consumed with a voracious indifference that transcended nationalities. The Scots\u2019 stubborn insistence on oatmeal roused all his own Irish intransigence, and the matter, at first a small, simmering disagreement, was now beginning to rise to a boil.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew as there was meant to be parritch,\u201d MacLeod explained, \u201cfor Fergus did say so, when he asked us to come. But it\u2019s been nothing but the meat and biscuit since we left Scotland, which is a wee bit griping to the belly if ye\u2019re not used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didna like to trouble Jamie Roy ower such a thing,\u201d Raeburn put in. \u201cGeordie\u2019s got his girdle, and we\u2019ve been makin\u2019 our own oatcake ower the lamps in the crew quarters. But we\u2019ve run through what corn we brought in our bags, and Mr. Murphy\u2019s got the keys to the pantry store.\u201d He glanced shyly at me under his sandy blond lashes. \u201cWe didna like to ask, knowin\u2019 what he thought of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe wouldna ken what\u2019s meant by the term \u2018spalpeens,\u2019 would ye, Mistress Fraser?\u201d MacRae asked, raising one bushy brow.</p><p>While listening to this outpouring of woe, I had been selecting assorted herbs from my box\u2014anise and angelica, two large pinches of horehound, and a few sprigs of peppermint. Tying these into a square of gauze, I closed the box and handed Innes his shirt, into which he burrowed at once, in search of refuge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to Mr. Murphy,\u201d I promised the Scots. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d I said to Innes, handing him the gauze bundle, \u201cbrew you a good pot of tea from that, and drink a cupful at every watch change. If we\u2019ve had no results by tomorrow, we\u2019ll try stronger measures.\u201d</p><p>As if in answer to this, a high, squeaking fart emerged from under Innes, to an ironic cheer from his colleagues.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s right, Mistress Fraser; maybe ye can scare the shit out o\u2019 him,\u201d MacLeod said, a broad grin splitting his face.</p><p>Innes, scarlet as a ruptured artery, took the bundle, bobbed his head in inarticulate thanks, and fled precipitously, followed in more leisurely fashion by the other smugglers.</p> <p>A rather acrimonious debate with Murphy followed, terminating without bloodshed, but with the compromise that I would be responsible for the preparation of the Scots\u2019 morning parritch, permitted to do so under provision that I confined myself to a single pot and spoon, did not sing while cooking, and was careful not to make a mess in the precincts of the sacred galley.</p><p>It was only that night, tossing restlessly in the cramped and chilly confines of my berth, that it occurred to me how odd the morning\u2019s incident had been. Were this Lallybroch, and the Scots Jamie\u2019s tenants, not only would they have had no hesitation in approaching him about the matter, they would have had no need to. He would have known already what was wrong, and taken steps to remedy the situation. Accustomed as I had always been to the intimacy and unquestioning loyalty of Jamie\u2019s own men, I found this distance troubling.</p><p>Jamie was not at the captain\u2019s table next morning, having gone out in the small boat with two of the sailors to catch whitebait, but I met him on his return at noon, sunburned, cheerful, and covered with scales and fish blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat have ye done to Innes, Sassenach?\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cHe\u2019s hiding in the starboard head, and says ye told him he mustna come out at all until he\u2019d shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him that, exactly,\u201d I explained. \u201cI just said if he hadn\u2019t moved his bowels by tonight, I\u2019d give him an enema of slippery elm.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced over his shoulder in the direction of the head.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose we will hope that Innes\u2019s bowels cooperate, or I doubt but he\u2019ll spend the rest of the voyage in the head, wi\u2019 a threat like that hangin\u2019 ower him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t worry; now that he and the others have their parritch back, their bowels ought to take care of themselves without undue interference from me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced down at me, surprised.</p><p>\u201cGot their parritch back? Whatever d\u2019ye mean, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I explained the genesis of the Oatmeal War, and its outcome, as he fetched a basin of water to clean his hands. A small frown drew his brows close together as he pushed his sleeves up his arms.</p><p>\u201cThey ought to have come to me about it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI expect they would have, sooner or later,\u201d I said. \u201cI only happened to find out by accident, when I found Innes grunting behind a hatch cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He set about scouring the bloodstains off his fingers, rubbing the clinging scales free with a small pumice stone.</p><p>\u201cThese men aren\u2019t like your tenants at Lallybroch, are they?\u201d I said, voicing the thought I had had.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. He dipped his fingers in the basin, leaving tiny shimmering circles where the fish scales floated. \u201cI\u2019m no their laird; only the man who pays them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey like you, though,\u201d I protested, then remembered Fergus\u2019s story and amended this rather weakly to, \u201cor at least five of them do.\u201d</p><p>I handed him the towel. He took it with a brief nod, and dried his hands. Looking down at the strip of cloth, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAye, MacLeod and the rest like me well enough\u2014or five of them do,\u201d he repeated ironically. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll stand by me if it\u2019s needful\u2014five of them. But they dinna ken me much, nor me them, save Innes.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the dirty water over the side, and tucking the empty basin under his arm, turned to go below, offering me his arm.</p><p>\u201cThere was more died at Culloden than the Stuart cause, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be coming for your dinner now?\u201d</p><p>I did not find out why Innes was different, until the next week. Perhaps emboldened by the success of the purgative I had given him, Innes came voluntarily to call upon me in my cabin a week later.</p><p>\u201cI am wondering, mistress,\u201d he said politely, \u201cwhether there might be a medicine for something as isna there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I must have looked puzzled at this description, for he lifted the empty sleeve of his shirt in illustration.</p><p>\u201cMy arm,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s no there, as ye can plainly see. And yet it pains me something terrible sometimes.\u201d He blushed slightly.</p><p>\u201cI did wonder for some years was I only a bit mad,\u201d he confided, in lowered tones. \u201cBut I spoke a bit wi\u2019 Mr. Murphy, and he tells me it\u2019s the same with his leg that got lost, and Fergus says he wakes sometimes, feeling his missing hand slide into someone\u2019s pocket.\u201d He smiled briefly, teeth a flash under his drooping mustache. \u201cSo I thought maybe if it was a common thing, to feel a limb that wasn\u2019t there, perhaps there was something that might be done about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I rubbed my chin, pondering. \u201cYes, it is common; it\u2019s called a phantom limb, when you still have feelings in a part that\u2019s been lost. As for what to do about it....\u201d I frowned, trying to think whether I had ever heard of anything therapeutic for such a situation. To gain time, I asked, \u201cHow did you happen to lose the arm?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, \u2019twas the blood poison,\u201d he said, casually. \u201cI tore a small hole in my hand wi\u2019 a nail one day, and it festered.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the sleeve, empty from the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it did,\u201d I said faintly.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. It was a lucky thing, though; it was that stopped me bein\u2019 transported wi\u2019 the rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe rest of whom?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, surprised. \u201cWhy, the other prisoners from Ardsmuir. Did Mac Dubh not tell ye about that? When they stopped the fortress from being a prison, they sent off all of the Scottish prisoners to be indenture men in the Colonies\u2014all but Mac Dubh, for he was a great man, and they didna want him out o\u2019 their sight, and me, for I\u2019d lost the arm, and was no good for hard labor. So Mac Dubh was taken somewhere else, and I was let go\u2014pardoned and set free. So ye see, it was a most fortunate accident, save only for the pain that comes on sometimes at night.\u201d He grimaced, and made as though to rub the nonexistent arm, stopping and shrugging at me in illustration of the problem.</p><p>\u201cI see. So you were with Jamie in prison. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d I was turning through the contents of my medicine chest, wondering whether a general pain reliever like willow-bark tea or horehound with fennel would work on a phantom pain.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Innes was losing his shyness, and beginning to speak more freely. \u201cI should have been dead of starvation by now, had Mac Dubh not come to find me, when he was released himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went looking for you?\u201d Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a flash of blue, and beckoned to Mr. Willoughby, who was passing by.</p> <p>\u201cAye. When he was released from his parole, he came to inquire, to see whether he could trace any of the men who\u2019d been taken to America\u2014to see whether any might have returned.\u201d He shrugged, the missing arm exaggerating the gesture. \u201cBut there were none in Scotland, save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Mr. Willoughby, have you a notion what might be done about this?\u201d Motioning to the Chinese to come and look, I explained the problem, and was pleased to hear that he did indeed have a notion. We stripped Innes of his shirt once again, and I watched, taking careful notes, as Mr. Willoughby pressed hard with his fingers at certain spots on the neck and torso, explaining as best he might what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cArm is in the ghost world,\u201d he explained. \u201cBody not; here in upper world. Arm tries to come back, for it does not like to be away from body. This\u2014 An-mo\u2014press-press\u2014this stops pain. But also we tell arm not come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how d\u2019ye do that?\u201d Innes was becoming interested in the procedure. Most of the crew would not let Mr. Willoughby touch them, regarding him as heathen, unclean, and a pervert to boot, but Innes had known and worked with the Chinese for the last two years.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby shook his head, lacking words, and burrowed in my medicine box. He came up with the bottle of dried hot peppers, and shaking out a careful handful, put it into a small dish.</p><p>\u201cHave fire?\u201d he inquired. I had a flint and steel, and with these he succeeded in kindling a spark to ignite the dried herb. The pungent smell filled the cabin, and we all watched as a small plume of white rose up from the dish and formed a small, hovering cloud over the dish.</p> <p>\u201cSend smoke of fan jiao messenger to ghost world, speak arm,\u201d Mr. Willoughby explained. Inflating his lungs and puffing out his cheeks like a blowfish, he blew lustily at the cloud, dispersing it. Then, without pausing, he turned and spat copiously on Innes\u2019s stump.</p><p>\u201cWhy, ye heathen bugger!\u201d Innes cried, eyes bulging with fury. \u201cD\u2019ye dare spit on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpit on ghost,\u201d Mr. Willoughby explained, taking three quick steps backward, toward the door. \u201cGhost afraid spittle. Not come back now right away.\u201d</p><p>I laid a restraining hand on Innes\u2019s remaining arm.</p><p>\u201cDoes your missing arm hurt now?\u201d I asked.</p><p>The rage began to fade from his face as he thought about it.</p><p>\u201cWell...no,\u201d he admitted. Then he scowled at Mr. Willoughby. \u201cBut that doesna mean I\u2019ll have ye spit on me whenever the fancy takes ye, ye wee poutworm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Mr. Willoughby said, quite cool. \u201cI not spit. You spit now. Scare you own ghost.\u201d</p> <p>Innes scratched his head, not sure whether to be angry or amused.</p><p>\u201cWell, I will be damned,\u201d he said finally. He shook his head, and picking up his shirt, pulled it on. \u201cStill,\u201d he said, \u201cI think perhaps next time, I\u2019ll try your tea, Mistress Fraser.\u201d</p><p>44</p><p>FORCES OF NATURE</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d said Jamie, \u201cam a fool.\u201d He spoke broodingly, watching Fergus and Marsali, who were absorbed in close conversation by the rail on the opposite side of the ship.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think so?\u201d I asked, though I had a reasonably good idea. The fact that all four of the married persons aboard were living in unwilling celibacy had given rise to a certain air of suppressed amusement among the members of the crew, whose celibacy was involuntary.</p><p>\u201cI have spent twenty years longing to have ye in my bed,\u201d he said, verifying my assumption, \u201cand within a month of having ye back again, I\u2019ve arranged matters so that I canna even kiss ye without sneakin\u2019 behind a hatch cover, and even then, half the time I look round to find Fergus looking cross-eyed down his nose at me, the little bastard! And no one to blame for it but my own foolishness. What did I think I was doing?\u201d he demanded rhetorically, glaring at the pair across the way, who were nuzzling each other with open affection.</p><p>\u201cWell, Marsali is only fifteen,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cI expect you thought you were being fatherly\u2014or stepfatherly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did.\u201d He looked down at me with a grudging smile. \u201cThe reward for my tender concern being that I canna even touch my own wife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you can touch me,\u201d I said. I took one of his hands, caressing the palm gently with my thumb. \u201cYou just can\u2019t engage in acts of unbridled carnality.\u201d</p><p>We had had a few abortive attempts along those lines, all frustrated by either the inopportune arrival of a crew member or the sheer uncongeniality of any nook aboard the Artemis sufficiently secluded as to be private. One late-night foray into the after hold had ended abruptly when a large rat had leapt from a stack of hides onto Jamie\u2019s bare shoulder, sending me into hysterics and depriving Jamie abruptly of any desire to continue what he was doing.</p><p>He glanced down at our linked hands, where my thumb continued to make secret love to his palm, and narrowed his eyes at me, but let me continue. He closed his fingers gently round my hand, his own thumb feather-light on my pulse. The simple fact was that we couldn\u2019t keep our hands off each other\u2014no more than Fergus and Marsali could\u2014despite the fact that we knew very well such behavior would lead only to greater frustration.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, in my own defense, I meant well,\u201d he said ruefully, smiling down into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what they say about good intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they say?\u201d His thumb was stroking gently up and down my wrist, sending small fluttering sensations through the pit of my stomach. I thought it must be true what Mr. Willoughby said, about sensations on one part of the body affecting another.</p><p>\u201cThey pave the road to Hell.\u201d I gave his hand a squeeze, and tried to take mine away, but he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d His eyes were on Fergus, who was teasing Marsali with an albatross\u2019s feather, holding her by one arm and tickling her beneath the chin as she struggled ineffectually to get away.</p><p>\u201cVerra true,\u201d he said. \u201cI meant to make sure the lass had a chance to think what she was about before the matter was too late for mending. The end result of my interference being that I lie awake half the night trying not to think about you, and listening to Fergus lust across the cabin, and come up in the morning to find the crew all grinning in their beards whenever they see me.\u201d He aimed a vicious glare at Maitland, who was passing by. The beardless cabin boy looked startled, and edged carefully away, glancing nervously back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow do you hear someone lust?\u201d I asked, fascinated.</p><p>He glanced down at me, looking mildly flustered.</p><p>\u201cOh! Well...it\u2019s only...\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment, then rubbed the bridge of his nose, which was beginning to redden in the sharp breeze.</p><p>\u201cHave ye any idea what men in a prison do, Sassenach, having no women for a verra long time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could guess,\u201d I said, thinking that perhaps I didn\u2019t really want to hear, firsthand. He hadn\u2019t spoken to me before about his time in Ardsmuir.</p><p>\u201cI imagine ye could,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cAnd ye\u2019d be right, too. There\u2019s the three choices; use each other, go a bit mad, or deal with the matter by yourself, aye?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look out to sea, and bent his head slightly to look down at me, a slight smile visible on his lips. \u201cD\u2019ye think me mad, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot most of the time,\u201d I replied honestly, turning round beside him. He laughed and shook his head ruefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna seem able to manage it. I now and then wished I could go mad\u201d\u2014he said thoughtfully \u201c\u2014it seemed a great deal easier than having always to think what to do next\u2014but it doesna seem to come natural to me. Nor does buggery,\u201d he added, with a wry twist of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t think so.\u201d Men who might in the ordinary way recoil in horror from the thought of using another man could still bring themselves to the act, out of desperate need. Not Jamie. Knowing what I did of his experiences at the hands of Jack Randall, I suspected that he very likely would have gone mad before seeking such resort himself.</p><p>He shrugged slightly, and stood silent, looking out to sea. Then he glanced down at his hands, spread before him, clutching the rail.</p><p>\u201cI fought them\u2014the soldiers who took me. I\u2019d promised Jenny I wouldn\u2019t\u2014she thought they\u2019d hurt me\u2014but when the time came, I couldna seem to help it.\u201d He shrugged again, and slowly opened and closed his right hand. It was his crippled hand, the third finger marked by a thick scar that ran the length of the first two joints, the fourth finger\u2019s second joint fused into stiffness, so that the finger stuck out awkwardly, even when he made a fist.</p><p>\u201cI broke this again then, against a dragoon\u2019s jaw,\u201d he said ruefully, waggling the finger slightly. \u201cThat was the third time; the second was at Culloden. I didna mind it much. But they put me in chains, and I minded that a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think you would.\u201d It was hard\u2014not difficult, but surprisingly painful\u2014to think of that lithe, powerful body subdued by metal, bound and humbled.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nay privacy in prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI minded that more than the fetters, I think. Day and night, always in sight of someone, wi\u2019 no guard for your thoughts but to feign sleep. As for the other...\u201d He snorted briefly, and shoved the loose hair back behind his ear. \u201cWell, ye wait for the light to go, for the only modesty there is, is darkness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The cells were not large, and the men lay close together for warmth in the night. With no modesty save darkness, and no privacy save silence, it was impossible to remain unaware of the accommodation each man made to his own needs.</p><p>\u201cI was in irons for more than a year, Sassenach,\u201d he said. He lifted his arms, spread them eighteen inches apart, and stopped abruptly, as though reaching some invisible limit. \u201cI could move that far\u2014and nay more,\u201d he said, staring at his immobile hands. \u201cAnd I couldna move my hands at all without the chain makin\u2019 a sound.\u201d</p><p>Torn between shame and need, he would wait in the dark, breathing in the stale and brutish scent of the surrounding men, listening to the murmurous breath of his companions, until the stealthy sounds nearby told him that the telltale clinking of his irons would be ignored.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I ken verra well, Sassenach,\u201d he said quietly, with a brief glance at Fergus, \u201cit\u2019s the sound of a man makin\u2019 love to a woman who\u2019s not there.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged and jerked his hands suddenly, spreading them wide on the rail, bursting his invisible chains. He looked down at me then with a half-smile, and I saw the dark memories at the back of his eyes, under the mocking humor.</p><p>I saw too the terrible need there, the desire strong enough to have endured loneliness and degradation, squalor and separation.</p><p>We stood quite still, looking at each other, oblivious of the deck traffic passing by. He knew better than any man how to hide his thoughts, but he wasn\u2019t hiding them from me.</p><p>The hunger in him went bone-deep, and my own bones seemed to dissolve in recognition of it. His hand was an inch from mine, resting on the wooden rail, long-fingered and powerful....If I touched him, I thought suddenly, he would turn and take me, here, on the deck boards.</p><p>As though hearing my thought, he took my hand suddenly, pressing it tight against the hard muscle of his thigh.</p> <p>\u201cHow many times have we lain together, since ye came back to me?\u201d he whispered. \u201cOnce, twice, in the brothel. Three times in the heather. And then at Lallybroch, again in Paris.\u201d His fingers tapped lightly against my wrist, one after the other, in time with my pulse.</p><p>\u201cEach time, I left your bed as hungry as ever I came to it. It takes no more to ready me now than the scent of your hair brushing past my face, or the feel of your thigh against mine when we sit to eat. And to see ye stand on deck, wi\u2019 the wind pressing your gown tight to your body...\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched slightly as he looked at me. I could see the pulse beat strong in the hollow of his throat, his skin flushed with wind and desire.</p><p>\u201cThere are moments, Sassenach, when for one copper penny, I\u2019d have ye on the spot, back against the mast and your skirts about your waist, and devil take the bloody crew!\u201d</p><p>My fingers convulsed against his palm, and he tightened his grasp, nodding pleasantly in response to the greeting of the gunner, coming past on his way toward the quarter-gallery.</p><p>The bell for the Captain\u2019s dinner sounded beneath my feet, a sweet metallic vibration that traveled up through the soles of my feet and melted the marrow of my bones. Fergus and Marsali left their play and went below, and the crew began preparations for the changing of the watch, but we stayed standing by the rail, fixed in each other\u2019s eyes, burning.</p> <p>\u201cThe Captain\u2019s compliments, Mr. Fraser, and will you be joining him for dinner?\u201d It was Maitland, the cabin boy, keeping a cautious distance as he relayed this message.</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath, and pulled his eyes away from mine.</p><p>\u201cAye, Mr. Maitland, we\u2019ll be there directly.\u201d He took another breath, settled his coat on his shoulders, and offered me his arm.</p><p>\u201cShall we go below, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d I drew my hand out of my pocket, having found what I was looking for. I took his hand and pressed the object into his palm.</p><p>He stared down at the image of King George III in his hand, then up at me.</p><p>\u201cOn account,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s go and eat.\u201d</p><p>The next day found us on deck again; though the air was still chilly, the cold was far preferable to the stuffiness of the cabins. We took our usual path, down one side of the ship and up the other, but then Jamie stopped, pausing to lean against the rail as he told me some anecdote about the printing business.</p> <p>A few feet away, Mr. Willoughby sat cross-legged in the protection of the mainmast, a small cake of wet black ink by the toe of his slipper and a large sheet of white paper on the deck before him. The tip of his brush touched the paper lightly as a butterfly, leaving surprising strong shapes behind.</p><p>As I watched, fascinated, he began again at the top of the page. He worked rapidly, with a sureness of stroke that was like watching a dancer or a fencer, sure of his ground.</p><p>One of the deckhands passed dangerously close to the edge of the paper, almost\u2014but not quite\u2014placing a large dirty foot on the snowy white. A few moments later, another man did the same thing, though there was plenty of room to pass by. Then the first man came back, this time careless enough to kick over the small cake of black ink as he passed.</p><p>\u201cTck!\u201d the seaman exclaimed in annoyance. He scuffed at the black splotch on the otherwise immaculate deck. \u201cFilthy heathen! Look \u2019ere, wot he\u2019s done!\u201d</p><p>The second man, returning from his brief errand, paused in interest. \u201cOn the clean deck? Captain Raines won\u2019t be pleased, will he?\u201d He nodded at Mr. Willoughby, mock-jovial. \u201cBest hurry and lick it up, little fella, before the Captain comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019ll do; lick it up. Quick, now!\u201d The first man moved a step nearer the seated figure, his shadow falling on the page like a blot. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s lips tightened just a shade, but he didn\u2019t look up. He completed the second column, righted the ink cake and dipped his brush without taking his eyes from the page, and began a third column, hand moving steadily.</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d began the first seaman, loudly, but stopped in surprise as a large white handkerchief fluttered down on the deck in front of him, covering the inkblot.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, gentlemen,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cI seem to have dropped something.\u201d With a cordial nod to the seamen, he bent down and swept up the handkerchief, leaving nothing but a faint smear on the decking. The seamen glanced at each other, uncertain, then at Jamie. One man caught sight of the blue eyes over the blandly smiling mouth, and blanched visibly. He turned hastily away, tugging at his mate\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cNorratall, sir,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cC\u2019mon, Joe, we\u2019re wanted aft.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t look either at the departing seamen or at Mr. Willoughby, but came toward me, tucking his handkerchief back in his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cA verra pleasant day, is it not, Sassenach?\u201d he said. He threw back his head, inhaling deeply. \u201cRefreshing air, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore so for some than for others, I expect,\u201d I said, amused. The air at this particular spot on deck smelled rather strongly of the alum-tanned hides in the hold below.</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of you,\u201d I said as he leaned back against the rail next to me. \u201cDo you think I should offer Mr. Willoughby the use of my cabin to write?\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve told him he can use my cabin, or the table in the mess between meals, but he\u2019d rather be here\u2014stubborn wee fool that he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose the light\u2019s better,\u201d I said dubiously, eyeing the small hunched figure, crouched doggedly against the mast. As I watched, a gust of wind lifted the edge of the paper; Mr. Willoughby pinned it at once, holding it still with one hand while continuing his short, sure brushstrokes with the other. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look comfortable, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Jamie ran his fingers through his hair in mild exasperation. \u201cHe does it on purpose, to provoke the crew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s what he\u2019s after, he\u2019s doing a good job,\u201d I observed. \u201cWhat on earth for, though?\u201d</p><p>Jamie leaned back against the rail beside me, and snorted once more.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, that\u2019s complicated. Ever met a Chinaman before, have ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few, but I suspect they\u2019re a bit different in my time,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cThey tend not to wear pigtails and silk pajamas, for one thing, nor do they have obsessions about ladies\u2019 feet\u2014or if they did, they didn\u2019t tell me about it,\u201d I added, to be fair.</p><p>Jamie laughed and moved a few inches closer, so that his hand on the rail brushed mine.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s to do wi\u2019 the feet,\u201d he said. \u201cOr that\u2019s the start of it, anyway. See, Josie, who\u2019s one of the whores at Madame Jeanne\u2019s, told Gordon about it, and of course he\u2019s told everyone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is it about the feet?\u201d I demanded, curiosity becoming overwhelming. \u201cWhat does he do to them?\u201d</p><p>Jamie coughed, and a faint flush rose in his cheeks. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly tell me anything that would shock me,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI have seen quite a lot of things in my life, you know\u2014and a good many of them with you, come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose ye have, at that,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cAye, well, it\u2019s no so much what he does, but\u2014well, in China, the highborn ladies have their feet bound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of that,\u201d I said, wondering what all the fuss was about. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to make their feet small and graceful.\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted again. \u201cGraceful, aye? D\u2019ye know how it\u2019s done?\u201d And proceeded to tell me.</p><p>\u201cThey take a tiny lassie\u2014nay more than a year old, aye?\u2014and turn under the toes of her feet until they touch her heel, then tie bandages about the foot to hold it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d I said involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cHer nanny will take the bandages off now and then to clean the foot, but puts them back directly. After some time, her wee toes rot and fall off. And by the time she\u2019s grown, the poor lassie\u2019s little more at the end of her legs than a crumple of bones and skin, smaller than the size o\u2019 my fist.\u201d His closed fist knocked softly against the wood of the rail in illustration. \u201cBut she\u2019s considered verra beautiful, then,\u201d he ended. \u201cGraceful, as ye say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfectly disgusting!\u201d I said. \u201cBut what has that got to do with\u2014\u201d I glanced at Mr. Willoughby, but he gave no sign of hearing us; the wind was blowing from him toward us, carrying our words out to sea.</p><p>\u201cSay this was a lassie\u2019s foot, Sassenach,\u201d he said, stretching his right hand out flat before him. \u201cCurl the toes under to touch the heel, and what have ye in the middle?\u201d He curled his fingers loosely into a fist in illustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, bewildered. Jamie extended the middle finger of his left hand, and thrust it abruptly through the center of his fist in an unmistakably graphic gesture.</p><p>\u201cA hole,\u201d he said succinctly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding! That\u2019s why they do it?\u201d</p><p>His forehead furrowed slightly, then relaxed. \u201cOh, am I jesting? By no means, Sassenach. He says\u201d\u2014he nodded delicately at Mr. Willoughby\u2014\u201cthat it\u2019s a most remarkable sensation. To a man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy, that perverted little beast!\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed at my indignation.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, that\u2019s about what the crew thinks, too. Of course, he canna get quite the same effect wi\u2019 a European woman, but I gather he...tries, now and then.\u201d</p><p>I began to understand the general feeling of hostility toward the little Chinese. Even a short acquaintance with the crew of the Artemis had taught me that seamen on the whole tended to be gallant creatures, with a strong romantic streak where women were concerned\u2014no doubt because they did without female company for a good part of the year.</p> <p>\u201cHm,\u201d I said, with a glance of suspicion at Mr. Willoughby. \u201cWell, that explains them, all right, but what about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s a wee bit complicated.\u201d Jamie\u2019s mouth curled upward in a wry smile. \u201cSee, to Mr. Yi Tien Cho, late of the Heavenly Kingdom of China, we\u2019re the barbarians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I glanced up at Brodie Cooper, coming down the ratlines above, the filthy, calloused soles of his feet all that was visible from below. I rather thought both sides had a point. \u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. I\u2019m a filthy, bad-smelling gwao-fe\u2014that means a foreign devil, ye ken\u2014wi\u2019 the stink of a weasel\u2014I think that\u2019s what huang-shu-lang means\u2014and a face like a gargoyle,\u201d he finished cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cHe told you all that?\u201d It seemed an odd recompense for saving someone\u2019s life. Jamie glanced down at me, cocking one eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cHave ye noticed, maybe, that verra small men will say anything to ye, when they\u2019ve drink taken?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think brandy makes them forget their size; they think they\u2019re great hairy brutes, and swagger something fierce.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at Mr. Willoughby, industriously painting. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit more circumspect when he\u2019s sober, but it doesna change what he thinks. It fair galls him, aye? Especially knowing that if it wasna for me, someone would likely knock him on the head or put him through the window into the sea some quiet night.\u201d</p><p>He spoke with simple matter-of-factness, but I hadn\u2019t missed the sideways looks directed at us by the passing seamen, and had already realized just why Jamie was passing time in idle conversation by the rail with me. If anyone had been in doubt about Mr. Willoughby\u2019s being under Jamie\u2019s protection, they would be rapidly disabused of the notion.</p><p>\u201cSo you saved his life, gave him work, and keep him out of trouble, and he insults you and thinks you\u2019re an ignorant barbarian,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cSweet little fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d The wind had shifted slightly, blowing a lock of Jamie\u2019s hair free across his face. He thumbed it back behind his ear and leaned farther toward me, our shoulders nearly touching. \u201cLet him say what he likes; I\u2019m the only one who understands him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I laid a hand over Jamie\u2019s where it rested on the rail.</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe not to say understand him,\u201d he admitted. He looked down at the deck between his feet. \u201cBut I do remember,\u201d he said softly, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to have nothing but your pride\u2014and a friend.\u201d</p><p>I remembered what Innes had said, and wondered whether it was the one-armed man who had been his friend in time of need. I knew what he meant; I had had Joe Abernathy, and knew what a difference it made.</p><p>\u201cYes, I had a friend at the hospital...\u201d I began, but was interrupted by loud exclamations of disgust emanating from under my feet.</p><p>\u201cDamn! Blazing Hades! That filth-eating son of a pig-fart!\u201d</p><p>I looked down, startled, then realized, from the muffled Irish oaths proceeding from below, that we were standing directly over the galley. The shouting was loud enough to attract attention from the hands forward, and a small group of sailors gathered with us, watching in fascination as the cook\u2019s black-kerchiefed head poked out of the hatchway, glaring ferociously at the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBurry-arsed swabs!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019re ye lookin\u2019 at? Two of yer idle barsteds tumble arse down here and toss this muck over the side! D\u2019ye mean me to be climbin\u2019 ladders all day, and me with half a leg?\u201d The head disappeared abruptly, and with a good-natured shrug, Picard motioned to one of the younger sailors to come along below.</p><p>Shortly there was a confusion of voices and a bumping of some large object down below, and a terrible smell assaulted my nostrils.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ on a piece of toast!\u201d I snatched a handkerchief from my pocket and clapped it to my nose; this wasn\u2019t the first smell I had encountered afloat, and I usually kept a linen square soaked in wintergreen in my pocket, as a precaution. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy the smell of it, dead horse. A verra old horse, at that, and a long time dead.\u201d Jamie\u2019s long, thin nose looked a trifle pinched around the nostrils, and all around, sailors were gagging, holding their noses, and generally commenting unfavorably on the smell.</p><p>Maitland and Grosman, faces averted from their burden, but slightly green nonetheless, manhandled a large cask through the hatchway and onto the deck. The top had been split, and I caught a brief glimpse of a yellowish-white mass in the opening, glistening faintly in the sun. It seemed to be moving. Maggots, in profusion.</p><p>\u201cEew!\u201d The exclamation was jerked from me involuntarily. The two sailors said nothing, their lips being pressed tightly together, but both of them looked as though they agreed with me. Together, they manhandled the cask to the rail and heaved it up and over.</p><p>Such of the crew as were not otherwise employed gathered at the rail to watch the cask bobbing in the wake, and be entertained by Murphy\u2019s outspokenly blasphemous opinion of the ship\u2019s chandler who had sold it to him. Manzetti, a small Italian seaman with a thick russet pigtail, was standing by the rail, loading a musket.</p><p>\u201cShark,\u201d he explained with a gleam of teeth beneath his mustache, seeing me watching him. \u201cVery good to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAr,\u201d said Sturgis approvingly.</p><p>Such of the crew as were not presently occupied gathered at the stern, watching. There were sharks, I knew; Maitland had pointed out to me two dark, flexible shapes hovering in the shadow of the hull the evening before, keeping pace with the ship with no apparent effort save a small and steady oscillation of sickled tails.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d A shout went up from several throats as the cask jerked suddenly in the water. A pause, and Manzetti fixed his aim carefully in the vicinity of the floating cask. Another jerk, as though something had bumped it violently, and another.</p><p>The water was a muddy gray, but clear enough for me to catch a glimpse of something moving under the surface, fast. Another jerk, the cask heeled to one side, and suddenly the sharp edge of a fin creased the surface of the water, and a gray back showed briefly, tiny waves purling off it.</p><p>The musket discharged next to me with a small roar and a cloud of black-powder smoke that left my eyes stinging. There was a universal shout from the observers, and when the watering of my eyes subsided, I could see a small brownish stain spreading round the cask.</p><p>\u201cDid he hit the shark, or the horsemeat?\u201d I asked Jamie, in a low-voiced aside.</p><p>\u201cThe cask,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cStill, it\u2019s fine shooting.\u201d</p><p>Several more shots went wild, while the cask began to dance an agitated jig, the frenzied sharks striking it repeatedly. Bits of white and brown flew from the broken cask, and a large circle of grease, rotten blood, and debris spread round the shark\u2019s feast. As though by magic, seabirds began to appear, one and two at a time, diving for tidbits.</p><p>\u201cNo good,\u201d said Manzetti at last, lowering the musket and wiping his face with his sleeve. \u201cToo far.\u201d He was sweating and stained from neck to hairline with black powder; the wiping left a streak of white across his eyes, like a raccoon\u2019s mask.</p><p>\u201cI could relish a slab of shark,\u201d said the Captain\u2019s voice near my ear. I turned to see him peering thoughtfully over the rail at the scene of carnage. \u201cPerhaps we might lower a boat, Mr. Picard.\u201d</p><p>The bosun turned with an obliging roar, and the Artemis hauled her wind, coming round in a small circle to draw near the remains of the floating cask. A small boat was launched, containing Manzetti, with musket, and three seamen armed with gaffs and rope.</p><p>By the time they reached the spot, there was nothing left of the cask but a few shattered bits of wood. There was still plenty of activity, though; the water roiled with the sharks\u2019 thrashing beneath the surface, and the scene was nearly obscured by a raucous cloud of seabirds. As I watched, I saw a pointed snout rise suddenly from the water, mouth open, seize one of the birds and disappear beneath the waves, all in the flick of an eyelash.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that?\u201d I said, awed. I was aware, in a general way, that sharks were well-equipped with teeth, but this practical demonstration was more striking than any number of National Geographic photographs.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Grandmother dear, what big teeth ye have!\u201d said Jamie, sounding suitably impressed.</p><p>\u201cOh, they do indeed,\u201d said a genial voice nearby. I glanced aside to find Murphy grinning at my elbow, broad face shining with a savage glee. \u201cLittle good it will do the buggers, with a ball blown clean through their f**king brains!\u201d He pounded a hamlike fist on the rail, and shouted, \u201cGet me one of them jagged buggers, Manzetti! There\u2019s a bottle o\u2019 cookin\u2019 brandy waitin\u2019 if ye do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a personal matter to ye, Mr. Murphy?\u201d Jamie asked politely. \u201cOr professional concern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, Mr. Fraser, both,\u201d the cook replied, watching the hunt with a fierce attention. He kicked his wooden leg against the side, with a hollow clunk. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a taste o\u2019 me,\u201d he said with grim relish, \u201cbut I\u2019ve tasted a good many more o\u2019 them!\u201d</p><p>The boat was barely visible through the flapping screen of birds, and their screams made it hard to hear anything other than Murphy\u2019s war cries.</p><p>\u201cShark steak with mustard!\u201d Murphy was bellowing, eyes mere slits in an ecstasy of revenge. \u201cStewed liver wi\u2019 piccalilli! I\u2019ll make soup o\u2019 yer fins, and jelly yer eyeballs in sherry wine, ye wicked barsted!\u201d</p><p>I saw Manzetti, kneeling in the bows, take aim with his musket, and the puff of black smoke as he fired. And then I saw Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen him jump from the rail; no one had, with all eyes fixed on the hunt. But there he was, some distance away from the melee surrounding the boat, his shaven head glistening like a fishing float as he wrestled in the water with an enormous bird, its wings churning the water like an eggbeater.</p><p>Alerted by my cry, Jamie tore his eyes from the hunt, goggled for an instant, and before I could move or speak, was perched on the rail himself.</p><p>My shout of horror coincided with a surprised roar from Murphy, but Jamie was gone, too, lancing into the water near the Chinaman with barely a splash.</p><p>There were shouts and cries from the deck\u2014and a shrill screech from Marsali\u2014as everyone realized what had happened. Jamie\u2019s wet red head emerged next to Mr. Willoughby, and in seconds, he had an arm tight about the Chinaman\u2019s throat. Mr. Willoughby clung tightly to the bird, and I wasn\u2019t sure, just for the moment, whether Jamie intended rescue or throttling, but then he kicked strongly, and began to tow the struggling mass of bird and man back toward the ship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Triumphant shouts from the boat, and a spreading circle of deep red in the water. There was a tremendous thrashing as one shark was gaffed and hauled behind the small boat by a rope about its tail. Then everything was confusion, as the men in the boat noticed what else was going on in the water nearby.</p><p>Lines were thrown over one side and then the other, and crewmen rushed back and forth in high excitement, undecided whether to help with rescue or shark, but at last Jamie and his burdens were hauled in to starboard, and dumped dripping on the deck, while the captured shark\u2014several large bites taken out of its body by its hungry companions\u2014was drawn in, still feebly snapping, to port.</p><p>\u201cJe...sus...Christ,\u201d Jamie said, chest heaving. He lay flat on the deck, gasping like a landed fish.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I knelt beside him, and wiped the water off his face with the hem of my skirt. He gave me a lopsided smile and nodded, still gasping.</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said at last, sitting up. He shook his head and sneezed. \u201cI thought I was eaten, sure. Those fools in the boat started toward us, and there were sharks all round them, under the water, bitin\u2019 at the gaffed one.\u201d He tenderly massaged his calves. \u201cIt\u2019s nay doubt oversensitive of me, Sassenach, but I\u2019ve always dreaded the thought of losing a leg. It seems almost worse than bein\u2019 killed outright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d as soon you didn\u2019t do either,\u201d I said dryly. He was beginning to shiver; I pulled off my shawl and wrapped it around his shoulders, then looked about for Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>The little Chinese, still clinging stubbornly to his prize, a young pelican nearly as big as he was, ignored both Jamie and the considerable abuse flung in his direction. He squelched below, dripping, protected from physical castigation by the clacking bill of his captive, which discouraged anyone from getting too close to him.</p><p>A nasty chunking sound and a crow of triumph from the other side of the deck announced Murphy\u2019s use of an ax to dispatch his erstwhile nemesis. The seamen clustered round the corpse, knives drawn, to get pieces of the skin. Further enthusiastic chopping, and Murphy came strolling past, beaming, a choice section of tail under his arm, the huge yellow liver hanging from one hand in a bag of netting, and the bloody ax slung over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot drowned, are ye?\u201d he said, ruffling Jamie\u2019s damp hair with his spare hand. \u201cI can\u2019t see why ye\u2019d bother wi\u2019 the little bugger, myself, but I\u2019ll say \u2019twas bravely done. I\u2019ll brew ye up a fine broth from the tail, to keep off the chill,\u201d he promised, and stumped off, planning menus aloud.</p> <p>\u201cWhy did he do it?\u201d I asked. \u201cMr. Willoughby, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head and blew his nose on his shirttail.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know. He wanted the bird, I expect, but I couldna say why. To eat, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Murphy overheard this and swung round at the head of the galley ladder, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYe can\u2019t eat pelicans,\u201d he said, shaking his head in disapproval. \u201cFishy-tasting, no matter how ye cook \u2019em. And God knows what one\u2019s doing out here anyway; they\u2019re shorebirds, pelicans. Blown out by a storm I suppose. Awkward buggers.\u201d His bald head disappeared into his realm, murmuring happily of dried parsley and cayenne.</p><p>Jamie laughed and stood up.</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, perhaps it\u2019s only he wants the feathers to make quills of. Come along below, Sassenach. Ye can help me dry my back.\u201d</p><p>He had spoken jokingly, but as soon as the words were out of his mouth, his face went blank. He glanced quickly to port, where the crew was arguing and jostling over the remains of the shark, while Fergus and Marsali cautiously examined the severed head, lying gape-jawed on the deck. Then his eyes met mine, with a perfect understanding.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, we were below in his cabin. Cold drops from his wet hair rained over my shoulders and slid down my bosom, but his mouth was hot and urgent. The hard curves of his back glowed warm through the soaked fabric of the shirt that stuck to them.</p><p>\u201cIfrinn!\u201d he said breathlessly, breaking loose long enough to yank at his breeches. \u201cChrist, they\u2019re stuck to me! I canna get them off!\u201d</p><p>Snorting with laughter, he jerked at the laces, but the water had soaked them into a hopeless knot.</p><p>\u201cA knife!\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s a knife?\u201d Snorting myself at the sight of him, struggling frantically to get his drenched shirttail out of his breeches, I began to rummage through the drawers of the desk, tossing out bits of paper, bottle of ink, a snuffbox\u2014everything but a knife. The closest thing was an ivory letter opener, made in the shape of a hand with a pointing finger.</p><p>I seized upon this and grasped him by the waistband, trying to saw at the tangled laces.</p><p>He yelped in alarm and backed away.</p> <p>\u201cChrist, be careful wi\u2019 that, Sassenach! It\u2019s no going to do ye any good to get my breeks off, and ye geld me in the process!\u201d</p><p>Half-crazed with lust as we were, that seemed funny enough to double us both up laughing.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Rummaging in the chaos of his berth, he snatched up his dirk and brandished it triumphantly. An instant later, the laces were severed and the sopping breeks lay puddled on the floor.</p><p>He seized me, picked me up bodily, and laid me on the desk, heedless of crumpled papers and scattered quills. Tossing my skirts up past my waist, he grabbed my hips and half-lay on me, his hard thighs forcing my legs apart.</p><p>It was like grasping a salamander; a blaze of heat in a chilly shroud. I gasped as the tail of his sopping shirt touched my bare belly, then gasped again as I heard footsteps in the passage.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I hissed in his ear. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d he said, with breathless certainty. \u201cI must have ye, or die.\u201d</p><p>He took me, with one quick, ruthless thrust, and I bit his shoulder hard, tasting salt and wet linen, but he made no sound. Two strokes, three, and I had my legs locked tight around his bu**ocks, my cry muffled in his shirt, not caring either who else might be coming.</p><p>He had me, quickly and thoroughly, and thrust himself home, and home, and home again, with a deep sound of triumph in his throat, shuddering and shaking in my arms.</p><p>Two minutes later, the cabin door swung open. Innes looked slowly round the wreckage of the room. His soft brown gaze traveled from the ravaged desk to me, sitting damp and disheveled, but respectably clothed, upon the berth, and rested at last on Jamie, who sat collapsed on a stool, still clad in his wet shirt, chest heaving and the deep red color fading slowly from his face.</p><p>Innes\u2019s nostrils flared delicately, but he said nothing. He walked into the cabin, nodding at me, and bent to reach under Fergus\u2019s berth, whence he pulled out a bottle of brandywine.</p><p>\u201cFor the Chinee,\u201d he said to me. \u201cSo as he mightn\u2019t take a chill.\u201d He turned toward the door and paused, squinting thoughtfully at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYe might should have Mr. Murphy make ye some broth on that same account, Mac Dubh. They do say as \u2019tis dangerous to get chilled after hard work, aye? Ye dinna want to take the ague.\u201d There was a faint twinkle in the mournful brown depths.</p><p>Jamie brushed back the salty tangle of his hair, a slow smile spreading across his face.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, and if it should come to that, Innes, at least I shall die a happy man.\u201d</p><p>We found out the next day what Mr. Willoughby wanted the pelican for. I found him on the afterdeck, the bird perched on a sail-chest beside him, its wings bound tight to its body by means of strips of cloth. It glared at me with round yellow eyes, and clacked its bill in warning.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby was pulling in a line, on the end of which was a small, wriggling purple squid. Detaching this, he held it up in front of the pelican and said something in Chinese. The bird regarded him with deep suspicion, but didn\u2019t move. Quickly, he seized the upper bill in his hand, pulled it up, and tossed the squid into the bird\u2019s pouch. The pelican, looking surprised, gulped convulsively and swallowed it.</p><p>\u201cHao-liao,\u201d Mr. Willoughby said approvingly, stroking the bird\u2019s head. He saw me watching, and beckoned me to come closer. Keeping a cautious eye on the wicked bill, I did so.</p><p>\u201cPing An,\u201d he said, indicating the pelican. \u201cPeaceful one.\u201d The bird erected a small crest of white feathers, for all the world as though it were pricking up its ears at its name, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cReally? What are you going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI teach him hunt for me,\u201d the little Chinese said matter-of-factly. \u201cYou watch.\u201d</p><p>I did. After several more squid and a couple of small fish had been caught and fed to the pelican, Mr. Willoughby removed another strip of soft cloth from the recesses of his costume, and wrapped this snugly round the bird\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cNot want choke,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot swallow fish.\u201d He then tied a length of light line tightly to this collar, motioned to me to stand back, and with a swift jerk, released the bindings that held the bird\u2019s wings.</p><p>Surprised at the sudden freedom, the pelican waddled back and forth on the locker, flapped its huge bony wings once or twice, and then shot into the sky in an explosion of feathers.</p><p>A pelican on the ground is a comical thing, all awkward angles, splayed feet, and gawky bill. A soaring pelican, circling over water, is a thing of wonder, graceful and primitive, startling as a pterodactyl among the sleeker forms of gulls and petrels.</p><p>Ping An, the peaceful one, soared to the limit of his line, struggled to go higher, then, as though resigned, began to circle. Mr. Willoughby, eyes squinted nearly shut against the sun, spun slowly round and round on the deck below, playing the pelican like a kite. All the hands in the rigging and on deck nearby stopped what they were doing to watch in fascination.</p><p>Sudden as a bolt from a crossbow, the pelican folded its wings and dived, cleaving the water with scarcely a splash. As it popped to the surface, looking mildly surprised, Mr. Willoughby began to tow it in. Aboard once more, the pelican was persuaded with some difficulty to give up its catch, but at last suffered its captor to reach cautiously into the leathery subgular pouch and extract a fine, fat sea bream.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby smiled pleasantly at a gawking Picard, took out a small knife, and slit the still-living fish down the back. Pinioning the bird in one wiry arm, he loosened the collar with his other hand, and offered it a flapping piece of bream, which Ping An eagerly snatched from his fingers and gulped.</p><p>\u201cHis,\u201d Mr. Willoughby explained, wiping blood and scales carelessly on the leg of his trousers. \u201cMine,\u201d nodding toward the half-fish still sitting on the locker, now motionless.</p><p>Within a week, the pelican was entirely tame, able to fly free, collared, but without the tethering line, returning to his master to regurgitate a pouchful of shining fish at his feet. When not fishing, Ping An either took up a position on the crosstrees, much to the displeasure of the crewmen responsible for swabbing the deck beneath, or followed Mr. Willoughby around the deck, waddling absurdly from side to side, eight-foot wings half-spread for balance.</p><p>The crew, both impressed by the fishing and wary of Ping An\u2019s great snapping bill, steered clear of Mr. Willoughby, who made his words each day beside the mast, weather permitting, secure under the benign yellow eye of his new friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I paused one day to watch Mr. Willoughby at his work, staying out of sight behind the shelter of the mast. He sat for a moment, a look of quiet satisfaction on his face, contemplating the finished page. I couldn\u2019t read the characters, of course, but the shape of the whole thing was somehow very pleasing to look at.</p><p>Then he glanced quickly around, as though checking to see that no one was coming, picked up the brush, and with great care, added a final character, in the upper left corner of the page. Without asking, I knew it was his signature.</p><p>He sighed then, and lifted his face to look out over the rail. Not inscrutable, by any means, his expression was filled with a dreaming delight, and I knew that whatever he saw, it was neither the ship, nor the heaving ocean beyond.</p><p>At last, he sighed again and shook his head, as though to himself. He laid hands on the paper, and quickly, gently, folded it, once, and twice, and again. Then rising to his feet, he went to the rail, extended his hands over the water, and let the folded white shape fall.</p> <p>It tumbled toward the water. Then the wind caught it and whirled it upward, a bit of white receding in the distance, looking much like the gulls and terns who squawked behind the ship in search of scraps.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby didn\u2019t stay to watch it, but turned away from the rail and went below, the dream still stamped on his small, round face.</p><p>45</p><p>MR. WILLOUGHBY\u2019S TALE</p><p>As we passed the center of the Atlantic gyre and headed south, the days and evenings became warm, and the off-duty crew began to congregate on the forecastle for a time after supper, to sing songs, dance to Brodie Cooper\u2019s fiddle, or listen to stories. With the same instinct that makes children camping in the wood tell ghost stories, the men seemed particularly fond of horrible tales of shipwreck and the perils of the sea.</p> <p>As we passed farther south, and out the realm of Kraken and sea serpent, the mood for monsters passed, and the men began instead to tell stories of their homes.</p><p>It was after most of these had been exhausted that Maitland, the cabin boy, turned to Mr. Willoughby, crouched as usual against the foot of the mast, with his cup cradled to his chest.</p><p>\u201cHow was it that you came from China, Willoughby?\u201d Maitland asked curiously. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen more than a handful of Chinese sailors, though folk do say as there\u2019s a great many people in China. Is it such a fine place that the inhabitants don\u2019t care to take leave of it, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>At first demurring, the little Chinese seemed mildly flattered at the interest provoked by this question. With a bit more urging, he consented to tell of his departure from his homeland\u2014requiring only that Jamie should translate for him, his own English being inadequate to the task. Jamie readily agreeing, he sat down beside Mr. Willoughby, and cocked his head to listen.</p><p>\u201cI was a Mandarin,\u201d Mr. Willoughby began, in Jamie\u2019s voice, \u201ca Mandarin of letters, one gifted in composition. I wore a silk gown, embroidered in very many colors, and over this, the scholar\u2019s blue silk gown, with the badge of my office embroidered upon breast and back\u2014the figure of a feng-huang\u2014a bird of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he means a phoenix,\u201d Jamie added, turning to me for a moment before directing his attention back to the patiently waiting Mr. Willoughby, who began speaking again at once.</p> <p>\u201cI was born in Pekin, the Imperial City of the Son of Heaven\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is how they call their emperor,\u201d Fergus whispered to me. \u201cSuch presumption, to equate their king with the Lord Jesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d hissed several people, turning indignant faces toward Fergus. He made a rude gesture at Maxwell Gordon, but fell silent, turning back to the small figure sitting crouched against the mast.</p><p>\u201cI was found early to have some skill in composition, and while I was not at first adept in the use of brush and ink, I learned at last with great effort to make the representations of my brush resemble the ideas that danced like cranes within my mind. And so I came to the notice of Wu-Xien, a Mandarin of the Imperial Household, who took me to live with him, and oversaw my training.</p><p>\u201cI rose rapidly in merit and eminence, so that before my twenty-sixth birthday, I had attained a globe of red coral upon my hat. And then came an evil wind, that blew the seeds of misfortune into my garden. It may be that I was cursed by an enemy, or perhaps that in my arrogance I had omitted to make proper sacrifice\u2014for surely I was not lacking in reverence to my ancestors, being careful always to visit my family\u2019s tomb each year, and to have joss sticks always burning in the Hall of Ancestors\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf his compositions were always so long-winded, no doubt the Son of Heaven lost patience and tossed him in the river,\u201d Fergus muttered cynically.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but whatever the cause,\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice continued, \u201cmy poetry came before the eyes of Wan-Mei, the Emperor\u2019s Second Wife. Second Wife was a woman of great power, having borne no less than four sons, and when she asked that I might become part of her own household, the request was granted at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was wrong wi\u2019 that?\u201d demanded Gordon, leaning forward in interest. \u201cA chance to get on in the world, surely?\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Willoughby evidently understood the question, for he nodded in Gordon\u2019s direction as he continued, and Jamie\u2019s voice took up the story.</p><p>\u201cOh, the honor was inestimable; I should have had a large house of my own within the walls of the palace, and a guard of soldiers to escort my palanquin, with a triple umbrella borne before me in symbol of my office, and perhaps even a peacock feather for my hat. My name would have been inscribed in letters of gold in the Book of Merit.\u201d</p><p>The little Chinaman paused, scratching at his scalp. The hair had begun to sprout from the shaved part, making him look rather like a tennis ball.</p><p>\u201cHowever, there is a condition of service within the Imperial Household; all the servants of the royal wives must be eunuchs.\u201d</p><p>A gasp of horror greeted this, followed by a babble of agitated comment, in which the remarks \u201cBloody heathen!\u201d and \u201cYellow bastards!\u201d were heard to predominate.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a eunuch?\u201d Marsali asked, looking bewildered.</p><p>\u201cNothing you need ever concern yourself with, ch\u00e8rie,\u201d Fergus assured her, slipping an arm about her shoulders. \u201cSo you ran, mon ami?\u201d he addressed Mr. Willoughby in tones of deepest sympathy. \u201cI should do the same, without doubt!\u201d</p><p>A deep murmur of heartfelt approbation reinforced this sentiment. Mr. Willoughby seemed somewhat heartened by such evident approval; he bobbed his head once or twice at his listeners before resuming his story.</p><p>\u201cIt was most dishonorable of me to refuse the Emperor\u2019s gift. And yet\u2014it is a grievous weakness\u2014I had fallen in love with a woman.\u201d</p><p>There was a sympathetic sigh at this, most sailors being wildly romantic souls, but Mr. Willoughby stopped, jerking at Jamie\u2019s sleeve and saying something to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m wrong,\u201d Jamie corrected himself. \u201cHe says it was not \u2018a woman\u2019\u2014just \u2018Woman\u2019\u2014all women, or the idea of women in general, he means. That\u2019s it?\u201d he asked, looking down at Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>The Chinaman nodded, satisfied, and sat back. The moon was full up by now, three-quarters full, and bright enough to show the little Mandarin\u2019s face as he talked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, through Jamie, \u201cI thought much of women; their grace and beauty, blooming like lotus flowers, floating like milkweed on the wind. And the myriad sounds of them, sometimes like the chatter of ricebirds, or the song of nightingales; sometimes the cawing of crows,\u201d he added with a smile that creased his eyes to slits and brought his hearers to laughter, \u201cbut even then I loved them.</p><p>\u201cI wrote all my poems to Woman\u2014sometimes they were addressed to one lady or another, but most often to Woman alone. To the taste of br**sts like apricots, the warm scent of a woman\u2019s navel when she wakens in the winter, the warmth of a mound that fills your hand like a peach, split with ripeness.\u201d</p><p>Fergus, scandalized, put his hands over Marsali\u2019s ears, but the rest of his hearers were most receptive.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder the wee fellow was an esteemed poet,\u201d Raeburn said with approval. \u201cIt\u2019s verra heathen, but I like it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth a red knob on your hat, anyday,\u201d Maitland agreed.</p><p>\u201cAlmost worth learning a bit of Chinee for,\u201d the master\u2019s mate chimed in, eyeing Mr. Willoughby with fresh interest. \u201cDoes he have a lot of those poems?\u201d</p><p>Jamie waved the audience\u2014by now augmented by most of the off-duty hands\u2014to silence and said, \u201cGo on, then,\u201d to Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>\u201cI fled on the Night of Lanterns,\u201d the Chinaman said. \u201cA great festival, and one when people would be thronging the streets; there would be no danger of being noticed by the watchmen. Just after dark, as the processions were assembling throughout the city, I put on the garments of a traveler\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s like a pilgrim,\u201d Jamie interjected, \u201cthey go to visit their ancestors\u2019 tombs far away, and wear white clothes\u2014that\u2019s for mourning, ye ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I left my house. I made my way through the crowds without difficulty, carrying a small anonymous lantern I had bought\u2014one without my name and place of residence painted on it. The watchmen were hammering upon their bamboo drums, the servants of the great households beating gongs, and from the roof of the palace, fireworks were being set off in great profusion.\u201d</p><p>The small round face was marked by nostalgia, as he remembered.</p><p>\u201cIt was in a way a most appropriate farewell for a poet,\u201d he said. \u201cFleeing nameless, to the sound of great applause. As I passed the soldiers\u2019 garrison at the city gate, I looked back, to see the many roofs of the Palace outlined by bursting flowers of red and gold. It looked like a magic garden\u2014and a forbidden one, for me.\u201d</p><p>Yi Tien Cho had made his way without incident through the night, but had nearly been caught the next day.</p><p>\u201cI had forgotten my fingernails,\u201d he said. He spread out a hand, small and short-fingered, the nails bitten to the quicks. \u201cFor a Mandarin has long nails, as symbol that he is not obliged to work with his hands, and my own were the length of one of my finger joints.\u201d</p><p>A servant at the house where he had stopped for refreshment next day saw them, and ran to tell the guard. Yi Tien Cho ran, too, and succeeded at last in eluding his pursuers by sliding into a wet ditch and lying hidden in the bushes.</p><p>\u201cWhile lying there, I destroyed my nails, of course,\u201d he said. He waggled the little finger of his right hand. \u201cI was obliged to tear that nail out, for it had a golden da zi inlaid in it, which I could not dislodge.\u201d</p><p>He had stolen a peasant\u2019s clothes from a bush where they had been hung to dry, leaving the torn-out nail with its golden character in exchange, and made his way slowly across country toward the coast. At first he paid for his food with the small store of money he had brought away, but outside Lulong he met with a band of robbers, who took his money but left him his life.</p><p>\u201cAnd after that,\u201d he said simply, \u201cI stole food when I could, and starved when I could not. And at last the wind of fortune changed a little, and I met with a group of traveling apothecaries, on their way to the physicians\u2019 fair near the coast. In return for my skill at drawing banners for their booth and composing labels extolling the virtues of their medicines, they carried me along with them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once reaching the coast, he had made his way to the waterfront, and tried there to pass himself off as a seaman, but failed utterly, as his fingers, so skillful with brush and ink, knew nothing of the art of knots and lines. There were several foreign ships in port; he had chosen the one whose sailors looked the most barbarous as being likely to carry him farthest away, and seizing his chance, had slipped past the deck guard and into the hold of the Serafina, bound for Edinburgh.</p><p>\u201cYou had always meant to leave the country altogether?\u201d Fergus asked, interested. \u201cIt seems a desperate choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmperor\u2019s reach very long,\u201d Mr. Willoughby said softly in English, not waiting for translation. \u201cI am exile, or I am dead.\u201d</p><p>His listeners gave a collective sigh at the awesome contemplation of such bloodthirsty power, and there was a moment of silence, with only the whine of the rigging overhead, while Mr. Willoughby picked up his neglected cup and drained the last drops of his grog.</p> <p>He set it down, licking his lips, and laid his hand once more on Jamie\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cIt is strange,\u201d Mr. Willoughby said, and the air of reflection in his voice was echoed exactly by Jamie\u2019s, \u201cbut it was my joy of women that Second Wife saw and loved in my words. Yet by desiring to possess me\u2014and my poems\u2014she would have forever destroyed what she admired.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby uttered a small chuckle, whose irony was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cNor is that the end of the contradiction my life has become. Because I could not bring myself to surrender my manhood, I have lost all else\u2014honor, livelihood, country. By that, I mean not only the land itself, with the slopes of noble fir trees where I spent my summers in Tartary, and the great plains of the south, the flowing of rivers filled with fish, but also the loss of myself. My parents are dishonored, the tombs of my ancestors fall into ruin, and no joss burns before their images.</p><p>\u201cAll order, all beauty is lost. I am come to a place where the golden words of my poems are taken for the clucking of hens, and my brushstrokes for their scratchings. I am taken as less than the meanest beggar, who swallows serpents for the entertainment of the crowds, allowing passersby to draw the serpent from my mouth by its tail for the tiny payment that will let me live another day.\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Willoughby glared round at his hearers, making his parallel evident.</p><p>\u201cI am come to a country of women coarse and rank as bears.\u201d The Chinaman\u2019s voice rose passionately, though Jamie kept to an even tone, reciting the words, but stripping them of feeling. \u201cThey are creatures of no grace, no learning, ignorant, bad-smelling, their bodies gross with sprouting hair, like dogs! And these\u2014these! disdain me as a yellow worm, so that even the lowest whores will not lie with me.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of Woman, I am come to a place where no woman is worthy of love!\u201d At this point, seeing the dark looks on the seamen\u2019s faces, Jamie ceased translating, and instead tried to calm the Chinaman, laying a big hand on the blue-silk shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAye, man, I quite see. And I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no a man present would have done otherwise, given the choice. Is that not so, lads?\u201d he asked, glancing over his shoulder with eyebrows raised significantly.</p><p>His moral force was sufficient to extort a grudging murmur of agreement, but the crowd\u2019s sympathy with the tale of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s travails had been quite dissipated by his insulting conclusion. Pointed remarks were made about licentious, ungrateful heathen, and a great many extravagantly admiring compliments paid to Marsali and me, as the men dispersed aft.</p><p>Fergus and Marsali left then, too, Fergus pausing en route to inform Mr. Willoughby that any further remarks about European women would cause him, Fergus, to be obliged to wrap his, Willoughby\u2019s, queue about his neck and strangle him with it.</p> <p>Mr. Willoughby ignored remarks and threats alike, merely staring straight ahead, his black eyes shining with memory and grog. Jamie at last stood up, too, and held out a hand to help me down from my cask.</p><p>It was as we were turning to leave that the Chinaman reached down between his legs. Completely without lewdness, he cupped his testicles, so that the rounded mass pressed against the silk. He rolled them slowly in the palm of his hand, staring at the bulge in deep meditation.</p><p>\u201cSometime,\u201d he said, as though to himself, \u201cI think not worth it.\u201d</p><p>46</p><p>WE MEET A PORPOISE</p><p>I had been conscious for some time that Marsali was trying to get up the nerve to speak to me. I had thought she would, sooner or later; whatever her feelings toward me, I was the only other woman aboard. I did my best to help, smiling kindly and saying \u201cGood morning,\u201d but the first move would have to be hers.</p><p>She made it, finally, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, a month after we had left Scotland.</p><p>I was writing in our shared cabin, making surgical notes on a minor amputation\u2014two smashed toes on one of the foredeck hands. I had just completed a drawing of the surgical site, when a shadow darkened the doorway of the cabin, and I looked up to see Marsali standing there, chin thrust out pugnaciously.</p> <p>\u201cI need to know something,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI dinna like ye, and I reckon ye ken that, but Da says you\u2019re a wisewoman, and I think you\u2019re maybe an honest woman, even if ye are a whore, so you\u2019ll maybe tell me.\u201d</p><p>There were any number of possible responses to this remarkable statement, but I refrained from making any of them.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d I said, putting down the pen. \u201cWhat is it you need to know?\u201d</p><p>Seeing that I wasn\u2019t angry, she slid into the cabin and sat down on the stool, the only available spot.</p><p>\u201cWeel, it\u2019s to do wi\u2019 bairns,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd how ye get them.\u201d</p><p>I raised one eyebrow. \u201cYour mother didn\u2019t tell you where babies come from?\u201d</p><p>She snorted impatiently, her small blond brows knotted in fierce scorn. \u201cO\u2019 course I ken where they come from! Any fool knows that much. Ye let a man put his prick between your legs, and there\u2019s the devil to pay, nine months later. What I want to know is how ye don\u2019t get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I regarded her with considerable interest. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a child? Er...once you\u2019re properly married, I mean? Most young women seem to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said slowly, twisting a handful of her dress. \u201cI think I maybe would like a babe sometime. For itself, I mean. If it maybe had dark hair, like Fergus.\u201d A hint of dreaminess flitted across her face, but then her expression hardened once more.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She pushed out her lips, thinking, then pulled them in again. \u201cWell, because of Fergus. We havena lain together yet. We havena been able to do more than kiss each other now and again behind the hatch covers\u2014thanks to Da and his bloody-minded notions,\u201d she added bitterly.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d I said, with some wryness.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d I waved a hand, dismissing it. \u201cWhat has that got to do with not wanting babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to like it,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cWhen we get to the prick part.\u201d</p><p>I bit the inside of my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI...er...imagine that has something to do with Fergus, but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t quite see what it has to do with babies.\u201d</p><p>Marsali eyed me warily. Without hostility for once, more as though she were estimating me in some fashion.</p><p>\u201cFergus likes ye,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fond of him, too,\u201d I answered cautiously, not sure where the conversation was heading. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for quite a long time, ever since he was a boy.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed suddenly, some of the tension going out of the slender shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOh. You\u2019ll know about it, then\u2014where he was born?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I understood her wariness.</p><p>\u201cThe brothel in Paris? Yes, I know about that. He told you, then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAye, he did. A long time ago, last Hogmanay.\u201d Well, I supposed a year was a long time to a fifteen-year-old.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I told him I loved him,\u201d she went on. Her eyes were fixed on her skirt, and a faint tinge of pink showed in her cheeks. \u201cAnd he said he loved me, too, but my mother wasna going to ever agree to the match. And I said why not, there was nothing so awful about bein\u2019 French, not everybody could be Scots, and I didna think his hand mattered a bit either\u2014after all, there was Mr. Murray wi\u2019 his wooden leg, and Mother liked him well enough\u2014but then he said, no, it was none of those things, and then he told me\u2014about Paris, I mean, and being born in a brothel and being a pick-pocket until he met Da.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes, a look of incredulity in the light blue depths. \u201cI think he thought I\u2019d mind,\u201d she said, wonderingly. \u201cHe tried to go away, and said he wouldna see me anymore. Well\u2014\u201d she shrugged, tossing her fair hair out of the way, \u201cI soon took care of that.\u201d She looked at me straight on, then, hands clasped in her lap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just I didna want to mention it, in case ye didn\u2019t know already. But since ye do...well, it\u2019s no Fergus I\u2019m worried about. He says he knows what to do, and I\u2019ll like it fine, once we\u2019re past the first time or two. But that\u2019s not what my Mam told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d I asked, fascinated.</p><p>A small line showed between the light brows. \u201cWell...\u201d Marsali said slowly, \u201cit wasna so much she said it\u2014though she did say, when I told her about Fergus and me, that he\u2019d do terrible things to me because of living wi\u2019 whores and having one for a mother\u2014it was more she...she acted like it.\u201d</p><p>Her face was a rosy pink now, and she kept her eyes in her lap, where her fingers twisted themselves in the folds of her skirt. The wind seemed to be picking up; small strands of blond hair rose gently from her head, wafted by the breeze from the window.</p><p>\u201cWhen I started to bleed the first time, she told me what to do, and about how it was part o\u2019 the curse of Eve, and I must just put up wi\u2019 it. And I said, what was the curse of Eve? And she read me from the Bible all about how St. Paul said women were terrible, filthy sinners because of what Eve did, but they could still be saved by suffering and bearing children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never did think a lot of St. Paul,\u201d I observed, and she looked up, startled.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s in the Bible!\u201d she said, shocked.</p><p>\u201cSo are a lot of other things,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cHeard that story about Gideon and his daughter, have you? Or the fellow who sent his lady out to be raped to death by a crowd of ruffians, so they wouldn\u2019t get him? God\u2019s chosen men, just like Paul. But go on, do.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at me for a minute, but then closed her mouth and nodded, a little stunned.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. Mother said as how it meant I was nearly old enough to be wed, and when I did marry, I must be sure to remember it was a woman\u2019s duty to do as her husband wanted, whether she liked it or no. And she looked so sad when she told me that...I thought whatever a woman\u2019s duty was, it must be awful, and from what St. Paul said about suffering and bearing children...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stopped and sighed. I sat quietly, waiting. When she resumed, it was haltingly, as though she had trouble choosing her words.</p><p>\u201cI canna remember my father. I was only three when the English took him away. But I was old enough when my mother wed\u2014wed Jamie\u2014to see how it was between them.\u201d She bit her lip; she wasn\u2019t used to calling Jamie by his name.</p><p>\u201cDa\u2014Jamie, I mean\u2014he\u2019s kind, I think; he always was to Joan and me. But I\u2019d see, when he\u2019d lay his hand on my mother\u2019s waist and try to draw her close\u2014she\u2019d shrink away from him.\u201d She gnawed her lip some more, then continued.</p><p>\u201cI could see she was afraid; she didna like him to touch her. But I couldna see that he ever did anything to be afraid of, not where we could see\u2014so I thought it must be something he did when they were in their bed, alone. Joan and I used to wonder what it could be; Mam never had marks on her face or her arms, and she didna limp when she walked\u2014not like Magdalen Wallace, whose husband always beats her when he\u2019s drunk on market day\u2014so we didna think Da hit her.\u201d</p> <p>Marsali licked her lips, dried by the warm salt air, and I pushed the jug of water toward her. She nodded in thanks and poured a cupful.</p><p>\u201cSo I thought,\u201d she said, eyes fixed on the stream of water, \u201cthat it must be because Mam had had children\u2014had us\u2014and she knew it would be terrible again and so she didna want to go to bed with\u2014with Jamie for fear of it.\u201d</p><p>She took a drink, then set down the cup and looked at me directly, firming her chin in challenge.</p><p>\u201cI saw ye with my Da,\u201d she said. \u201cJust that minute, before he saw me. I\u2014I think ye liked what he was doing to you in the bed.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, and closed it again.</p> <p>\u201cWell...yes,\u201d I said, a little weakly. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>She grunted in satisfaction. \u201cMmphm. And ye like it when he touches ye; I\u2019ve seen. Well, then. Ye havena got any children. And I\u2019d heard there are ways not to have them, only nobody seems to know just how, but you must, bein\u2019 a wisewoman and all.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to one side, studying me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a babe,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut if it\u2019s got to be a babe or liking Fergus, then it\u2019s Fergus. So it won\u2019t be a babe\u2014if you\u2019ll tell me how.\u201d</p><p>I brushed the curls back behind my ear, wondering where on earth to start.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, drawing a deep breath, \u201cto begin with, I have had children.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes sprang wide and round at this.</p><p>\u201cYe do? Does Da\u2014does Jamie know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course he does,\u201d I replied testily. \u201cThey were his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never heard Da had any bairns at all.\u201d The pale eyes narrowed with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine he thought it was any of your business,\u201d I said, perhaps a trifle more sharply than necessary. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not, either,\u201d I added, but she just raised her brows and went on looking suspicious.</p><p>\u201cThe first baby died,\u201d I said, capitulating. \u201cIn France. She\u2019s buried there. My\u2014our second daughter is grown now; she was born after Culloden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s never seen her? The grown one?\u201d Marsali spoke slowly, frowning.</p><p>I shook my head, unable to speak for a moment. There seemed to be something stuck in my throat, and I reached for the water. Marsali pushed the jug absently in my direction, leaning against the swing of the ship.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s verra sad,\u201d she said softly, to herself. Then she glanced up at me, frowning once more in concentration as she tried to work it all out.</p><p>\u201cSo ye\u2019ve had children, and it didna make a difference to you? Mmphm. But it\u2019s been a long while, then\u2014did ye have other men whilst ye were away in France?\u201d Her lower lip came up over the upper one, making her look very much like a small and stubborn bulldog.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said firmly, putting the cup down, \u201cis definitely none of your business. As to whether childbirth makes a difference, possibly it does to some women, but not all of them. But whether it does or not, there are good reasons why you might not want to have a child right away.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew the pouting underlip and sat up straight, interested.</p><p>\u201cSo there is a way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of ways, and unfortunately most of them don\u2019t work,\u201d I told her, with a pang of regret for my prescription pad and the reliability of contraceptive pills. Still, I remembered well enough the advice of the ma\u00eetresses sage-femme, the experienced midwives of the H\u00f4pital des Anges, where I had worked in Paris twenty years before.</p><p>\u201cHand me the small box in the cupboard over there,\u201d I said, pointing to the doors above her head. \u201cYes, that one.</p><p>\u201cSome of the French midwives make a tea of bayberry and valerian,\u201d I said, rummaging in my medicine box. \u201cBut it\u2019s rather dangerous, and not all that dependable, I don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye miss her?\u201d Marsali asked abruptly. I glanced up, startled. \u201cYour, daughter?\u201d Her face was abnormally expressionless, and I suspected the question had more to do with Laoghaire than with me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply. \u201cBut she\u2019s grown; she has her own life.\u201d The lump in my throat was back, and I bent my head over the medicine box, hiding my face. The chances of Laoghaire ever seeing Marsali again were just about as good as the chances that I would ever see Brianna; it wasn\u2019t a thought I wanted to dwell on.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, pulling out a large chunk of cleaned sponge. I took one of the thin surgical knives from the fitted slots in the lid of the box and carefully sliced off several thin pieces, about three inches square. I searched through the box again and found the small bottle of tansy oil, with which I carefully saturated one square under Marsali\u2019s fascinated gaze.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s about how much oil to use. If you haven\u2019t any oil, you can dip the sponge in vinegar\u2014even wine will work, in a pinch. You put the bit of sponge well up inside you before you go to bed with a man\u2014mind you do it even the first time; you can get with child from even once.\u201d</p><p>Marsali nodded, her eyes wide, and touched the sponge gently with a forefinger. \u201cAye? And\u2014and after? Do I take it out again, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>An urgent shout from above, coupled with a sudden heeling of the Artemis as she backed her mainsails, put an abrupt end to the conversation. Something was happening up above.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d I said, pushing the sponge and bottle toward her, and headed for the passage.</p><p>Jamie was standing with the Captain on the afterdeck, watching the approach of a large ship behind us. She was perhaps three times the size of the Artemis, three-masted, with a perfect forest of rigging and sail, through which small black figures hopped like fleas on a bedsheet. A puff of white smoke floated in her wake, token of a cannon recently fired.</p><p>\u201cIs she firing on us?\u201d I asked in amazement.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said grimly. \u201cA warning shot only. She means to board us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they?\u201d I addressed the question to Captain Raines, who was looking even more glum than usual, the downturned corners of his mouth sunk in his beard.</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll not outrun her in a stiff breeze like this, on the open sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is she?\u201d Her ensign flew at the masthead, but seen against the sun at this distance, it looked completely black.</p><p>Jamie glanced down at me, expressionless. \u201cA British man-o-war, Sassenach. Seventy-four guns. Perhaps ye\u2019d best go below.\u201d</p><p>This was bad news. While Britain was no longer at war with France, relations between the two countries were by no means cordial. And while the Artemis was armed, she had only four twelve-pound guns; sufficient to deter small pirates, but no match for a man-of-war.</p><p>\u201cWhat can they want of us?\u201d Jamie asked the Captain. Raines shook his head, his soft, plump face set grimly.</p><p>\u201cLikely pressing,\u201d he answered. \u201cShe\u2019s shorthanded; you can see by her rigging\u2014and her foredeck all ahoo,\u201d he noted disapprovingly, eyes fixed on the man-of-war, now looming as she drew alongside. He glanced at Jamie. \u201cThey can press any of our hands who look to be British\u2014which is something like half the crew. And yourself, Mr. Fraser\u2014unless you wish to pass for French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Jamie said softly. He glanced at me and frowned. \u201cDid I not tell ye to get below?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d I said, not going. I drew closer to him, my eyes fixed on the man-of-war, where a small boat was now being lowered. One officer, in a gilded coat and laced hat, was climbing down the side.</p><p>\u201cIf they press the British hands,\u201d I asked Captain Raines, \u201cwhat will happen to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll serve aboard the Porpoise\u2014that\u2019s her,\u201d he nodded at the man-of-war, which sported a puff-lipped fish as the figurehead, \u201cas members of the Royal Navy. She may release the pressed hands when she reaches port\u2014or she may not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You mean they can just kidnap men and make them serve as sailors for as long as they please?\u201d A thrill of fear shot through me, at the thought of Jamie\u2019s being abruptly taken away.</p><p>\u201cThey can,\u201d the Captain said shortly. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll have a job of it to reach Jamaica ourselves, with half a crew.\u201d He turned abruptly and went forward, to greet the arriving boat.</p><p>Jamie gripped my elbow and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll not take Innes or Fergus,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll help ye to hunt for Young Ian. If they take us\u201d\u2014I noted the \u201cus\u201d with a sharp pang\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll go on to Jared\u2019s place at Sugar Bay, and search from there.\u201d He looked down and gave me a brief smile. \u201cI\u2019ll meet ye there,\u201d he said, and gave my elbow a reassuring squeeze. \u201cI canna say how long it might be, but I\u2019ll come to ye there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could pass as a Frenchman!\u201d I protested. \u201cYou know you could!\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, and shook his head, smiling faintly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI canna let them take my men, and stay behind, hiding under a Frenchman\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I started to protest that the Scottish smugglers were not his men, had no claim on his loyalty, and then stopped, realizing that it was useless. The Scots might not be his tenants or his kin, and one of them might well be a traitor. But he had brought them here, and if they went, he would go with them.</p><p>\u201cDinna mind it, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI shall be all right, one way or the other. But I think it is best if our name is Malcolm, for the moment.\u201d</p><p>He patted my hand, then released it and went forward, shoulders braced to meet whatever was coming. I followed, more slowly. As the gig pulled alongside, I saw Captain Raines\u2019s eyebrows rise in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cGod save us, what is this?\u201d he murmured under his breath, as a head appeared above the Artemis\u2019s rail.</p><p>It was a young man, evidently in his late twenties, but with his face drawn and shoulders slumping with fatigue. A uniform coat that was too big for him had been tugged on over a filthy shirt, and he staggered slightly as the deck of the Artemis rose beneath him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are the captain of this ship?\u201d The Englishman\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed from tiredness, but he picked Raines from the crowd of grim-faced hands at a glance. \u201cI am acting captain Thomas Leonard, of His Majesty\u2019s ship Porpoise. For the love of God,\u201d he said, speaking hoarsely, \u201chave you a surgeon aboard?\u201d</p><p>Over a warily offered glass of port below, Captain Leonard explained that the Porpoise had suffered an outbreak of some infectious plague, beginning some four weeks before.</p><p>\u201cHalf the crew are down with it,\u201d he said, wiping a crimson drop from his stubbled chin. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost thirty men so far, and look fair to lose a lot more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost your captain?\u201d Raines asked.</p> <p>Leonard\u2019s thin face flushed slightly. \u201cThe\u2014the captain and the two senior lieutenants died last week, and the surgeon and the surgeon\u2019s mate, as well. I was third lieutenant.\u201d That explained both his surprising youth and his nervous state; to be landed suddenly in sole command of a large ship, a crew of six hundred men, and a rampant infection aboard, was enough to rattle anyone.</p><p>\u201cIf you have anyone aboard with some medical experience...\u201d He looked hopefully from Captain Raines to Jamie, who stood by the desk, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Artemis\u2019s surgeon, Captain Leonard,\u201d I said, from my place in the doorway. \u201cWhat symptoms do your men have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d The young captain\u2019s head swiveled to stare at me. His jaw hung slackly open, showing the furred tongue and stained teeth of a tobacco-chewer.</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s a rare healer, Captain,\u201d Jamie said mildly. \u201cIf it\u2019s help ye came for, I\u2019d advise ye to answer her questions, and do as she tells ye.\u201d</p> <p>Leonard blinked once, but then took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cYes. Well, it seems to start with griping pains in the belly, and a terrible flux and vomiting. The afflicted men complain of headache, and they have considerable fever. They...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo some of them have a rash on their bellies?\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>He nodded eagerly. \u201cThey do. And some of them bleed from the arse as well. Oh, I beg pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, suddenly flustered. \u201cI meant no offense, only that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know what that might be,\u201d I interrupted his apologies. A feeling of excitement began to grow in me; the feeling of a diagnosis just under my hands, and the sure knowledge of how to proceed with it. The call of trumpets to a warhorse, I thought with wry amusement. \u201cI\u2019d need to look at them, to be sure, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife would be pleased to advise ye, Captain,\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid she canna go aboard your ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Captain Leonard looked from one to the other of us, eyes desperate with disappointment. \u201cIf she could only look at my crew...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said, at the same moment I replied, \u201cYes, of course!\u201d</p><p>There was an awkward silence for a moment. Then Jamie rose to his feet, said politely, \u201cYou\u2019ll excuse us, Captain Leonard?\u201d and dragged me bodily out of the cabin, down the passage to the afterhold.</p><p>\u201cAre ye daft?\u201d he hissed, still clutching me by one arm. \u201cYe canna be thinking of setting foot on a ship wi\u2019 the plague! Risk your life and the crew and Young Ian, all for the sake of a pack of Englishmen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t plague,\u201d I said, struggling to get free. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t be risking my life. Let go of my arm, you bloody Scot!\u201d</p><p>He let go, but stood blocking the ladder, glowering at me.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I said, striving for patience. \u201cIt isn\u2019t plague; I\u2019m almost sure it\u2019s typhoid fever\u2014the rash sounds like it. I can\u2019t catch that, I\u2019ve been vaccinated for it.\u201d</p><p>Momentary doubt flitted across his face. Despite my explanations, he was still inclined to consider germs and vaccines in the same league with black magic.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d he said skeptically. \u201cWell, perhaps that\u2019s so, but still...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, groping for words. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor. They\u2019re sick, and I can do something about it. I...it\u2019s...well, I have to, that\u2019s all!\u201d</p><p>Judging from its effect, this statement appeared to lack something in eloquence. Jamie raised one eyebrow, inviting me to go on.</p><p>I took a deep breath. How should I explain it\u2014the need to touch, the compulsion to heal? In his own way, Frank had understood. Surely there was a way to make it clear to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI took an oath,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen I became a physician.\u201d</p><p>Both eyebrows went up. \u201cAn oath?\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhat sort of oath?\u201d</p><p>I had said it aloud only the one time. Still, I had had a framed copy in my office; Frank had given it to me, a gift when I graduated from medical school. I swallowed a small thickening in my throat, closed my eyes, and read what I could remember from the scroll before my mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI swear by Apollo the physician, by Aesculapius, Hygeia, and Panacea, and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment the following Oath:</p><p>I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug, nor give advice which may cause his death. But I will preserve the purity of my life and my art. In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction, and especially from the pleasures of love with women or with men, be they free or slaves. All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or outside of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal. If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes, to find him looking down at me thoughtfully. \u201cEr...parts of it are just for tradition,\u201d I explained.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched slightly. \u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, the first part sounds a wee bit pagan, but I like the part about how ye willna seduce anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like that one,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cCaptain Leonard\u2019s virtue is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>He gave a small snort and leaned back against the ladder, running one hand slowly through his hair.</p><p>\u201cIs that how it\u2019s done, then, in the company of physicians?\u201d he asked. \u201cYe hold yourself bound to help whoever calls for it, even an enemy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a great difference, you know, if they\u2019re ill or hurt.\u201d I looked up, searching his face for understanding.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve taken an oath now and then, myself\u2014and none of them lightly.\u201d He reached out and took my right hand, his fingers resting on my silver ring. \u201cSome weigh heavier than others, though,\u201d he said, watching my face in turn.</p><p>He was very close to me, the sun from the hatchway overhead striping the linen of his sleeve, the skin of his hand a deep ruddy bronze where it cradled my own white fingers, and the glinting silver of my wedding ring.</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d I said softly, speaking to his thought. \u201cYou know it does.\u201d I laid my other hand against his chest, its gold ring glowing in a bar of sunlight. \u201cBut where one vow can be kept, without damage to another...?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, deeply enough to move the hand on my chest, then bent and kissed me, very gently.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I wouldna have ye be forsworn,\u201d he said, straightening up with a wry twist to his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re sure of this vaccination of yours? It does work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should go with ye,\u201d he said, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014you haven\u2019t been vaccinated, and typhoid\u2019s awfully contagious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only thinking it\u2019s typhoid, from what Leonard says,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYe dinna ken for sure that it\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut there\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>I was assisted up onto the deck of the Porpoise by means of a bosun\u2019s chair, a terrorizing swing over empty air and frothing sea. I landed ignominiously in a sprawl on the deck. Once I regained my feet, I was astonished to find how solid the deck of the man-of-war felt, compared to the tiny, pitching quarterdeck of the Artemis, far below. It was like standing on the Rock of Gibraltar.</p><p>My hair had blown loose during the trip between the ships; I twisted it up and repinned it as best I could, then reached to take the medicine box I had brought from the midshipman who held it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best show me where they are,\u201d I said. The wind was brisk, and I was aware that it was taking a certain amount of work on the part of both crews to keep the two ships close together, even as both drifted leeward.</p><p>It was dark in the tween-decks, the confined space lit by small oil lamps that hung from the ceiling, swaying gently with the rise and fall of the ship, so that the ranks of hammocked men lay in deep shadow, blotched with dim patches of light from above. They looked like pods of whales, or sleeping sea beasts, lying humped and black, side by side, swaying with the movement of the sea beneath.</p><p>The stench was overpowering. What air there was came down through crude ventilator shafts that reached the upper deck, but that wasn\u2019t a lot. Worse than unwashed seamen was the reek of vomitus and the ripe, throat-clogging smell of blood-streaked diarrhea, which liberally spattered the decking beneath the hammocks, where sufferers had been too ill to reach the few available chamber pots. My shoes stuck to the deck, coming away with a nasty sucking noise as I made my way cautiously into the area.</p><p>\u201cGive me a better light,\u201d I said peremptorily to the apprehensive-looking young midshipman who had been told off to accompany me. He was holding a kerchief to his face and looked both scared and miserable, but he obeyed, holding up the lantern he carried so that I could peer into the nearest hammock.</p><p>The occupant groaned and turned away his face as the light struck him. He was flushed with fever, and his skin hot to the touch. I pulled his shirt up and felt his stomach; it too was hot, the skin distended and hard. As I prodded gently here and there, the man writhed like a worm on a hook, uttering piteous groans.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said soothingly, urging him to flatten out again. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll help you; it will feel better soon. Let me look into your eyes, now. Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>I pulled back the eyelid; his pupil shrank in the light, leaving his eyes brown and red-rimmed with suffering.</p><p>\u201cChrist, take away the light!\u201d he gasped, jerking his head away. \u201cIt splits my head!\u201d Fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache.</p><p>\u201cDo you have chills?\u201d I asked, waving back the midshipman\u2019s lantern.</p><p>The answer was more a moan than a word, but in the affirmative. Even in the shadows, I could see that many of the men in the hammocks were wrapped in their blankets, though it was stifling hot here below. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If not for the headache, it could be simple gastroenteritis\u2014but not with this many men stricken. Something very contagious indeed, and I was fairly sure what. Not malaria, coming from Europe to the Caribbean. Typhus was a possibility; spread by the common body louse, it was prone to rapid spread in close quarters like these, and the symptoms were similar to those I saw around me\u2014with one distinctive difference.</p><p>That seaman didn\u2019t have the characteristic belly rash, nor the next, but the third one did. The light red rosettes were plain on the clammy white skin. I pressed firmly on one, and it disappeared, blinking back into existence a moment later, as the blood returned to the skin. I squeezed my way between the hammocks, the heavy, sweating bodies pressing in on me from either side, and made my way back to the companionway where Captain Leonard and two more of his midshipmen waited for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s typhoid,\u201d I told the Captain. I was as sure as I could be, lacking a microscope and blood culture.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His drawn face remained apprehensive. \u201cDo you know what to do for it, Mrs. Malcolm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but it won\u2019t be easy. The sick men need to be taken above, washed thoroughly, and laid where they can have fresh air to breathe. Beyond that, it\u2019s a matter of nursing; they\u2019ll need to have a liquid diet\u2014and lots of water\u2014boiled water, that\u2019s very important!\u2014and sponging to bring down the fever. The most important thing is to avoid infecting any more of your crew, though. There are several things that need to be done\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo them,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI shall give orders to have as many of the healthy men as can be spared to attend you; order them as you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, with a dubious glance at the surroundings. \u201cI can make a start, and tell you how to be going on, but it\u2019s going to be a big job. Captain Raines and my husband will be anxious to be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Malcolm,\u201d the Captain said earnestly, \u201cI shall be eternally grateful for any assistance you can render us. We are most urgently bound for Jamaica, and unless the remainder of my crew can be saved from this wicked illness, we will never reach that island.\u201d He spoke with profound seriousness, and I felt a twinge of pity for him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said with a sigh. \u201cSend me a dozen healthy crewmen, for a start.\u201d</p> <p>Climbing to the quarterdeck, I went to the rail and waved at Jamie, who was standing by the Artemis\u2019s wheel, looking upward. I could see his face clearly, despite the distance; it was worried, but relaxed into a broad smile when he saw me.</p><p>\u201cAre ye comin\u2019 down now?\u201d he shouted, cupping his hands.</p><p>\u201cNot yet!\u201d I shouted back. \u201cI need two hours!\u201d Holding up two fingers to make my meaning clear in case he hadn\u2019t heard, I stepped back from the rail, but not before I saw the smile fade from his face. He\u2019d heard.</p><p>I saw the sick men removed to the afterdeck, and a crew of hands set to strip them of their filthy clothes, and hose and sponge them with seawater from the pumps. I was in the galley, instructing the cook and galley crew in food-handling precautions, when I felt the movement of the deck under my feet.</p><p>The cook to whom I was talking snaked out a hand and snapped shut the latch of the cupboard behind him. With the utmost dispatch, he grabbed a loose pot that leapt off its shelf, thrust a large ham on a spit into the lower cupboard, and whirled to clap a lid on the boiling pot hung over the galley fire.</p><p>I stared at him in astonishment. I had seen Murphy perform this same odd ballet, whenever the Artemis cast off or changed course abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I said, but then abandoned the question, and headed for the quarterdeck, as fast as I could go. We were under way; big and solid as the Porpoise was, I could feel the vibration that ran through the keel as she took the wind.</p><p>I burst onto the deck to find a cloud of sails overhead, set and drawing, and the Artemis falling rapidly behind us. Captain Leonard was standing by the helmsman, looking back to the Artemis, as the master bawled commands to the men overhead.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou bloody little bastard, what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>The Captain glanced at me, plainly embarrassed, but with his jaw set stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cWe must get to Jamaica with the utmost dispatch,\u201d he said. His cheeks were chapped red with the rushing sea wind, or he might have blushed. \u201cI am sorry, Mrs. Malcolm\u2014indeed I regret the necessity, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing!\u201d I said, furious. \u201cPut about! Heave to! Drop the bloody anchor! You can\u2019t take me away like this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret the necessity,\u201d he said again, doggedly. \u201cBut I believe that we require your continuing services most urgently, Mrs. Malcolm. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d he said, striving for a reassurance that he didn\u2019t achieve. He reached out as though to pat my shoulder, but then thought better of it. His hand dropped to his side.</p><p>\u201cI have promised your husband that the navy will provide you accommodation in Jamaica until the Artemis arrives there.\u201d</p> <p>He flinched backward at the look on my face, evidently afraid that I might attack him\u2014and not without reason.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you promised my husband?\u201d I said, through gritted teeth. \u201cDo you mean that J\u2014that Mr. Malcolm permitted you to abduct me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...no. No, he didn\u2019t.\u201d The Captain appeared to be finding the interview a strain. He dragged a filthy handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his brow and the back of his neck. \u201cHe was most intransigent, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntransigent, eh? Well, so am I!\u201d I stamped my foot on the deck, aiming for his toes, and missing only because he leapt agilely backward. \u201cIf you expect me to help you, you bloody kidnapper, just bloody think again!\u201d</p><p>The Captain tucked his handkerchief away and set his jaw. \u201cMrs. Malcolm. You compel me to tell you what I told your husband. The Artemis sails under a French flag, and with French papers, but more than half her crew are Englishmen or Scots. I could have pressed these men to service here\u2014and I badly need them. Instead, I have agreed to leave them unmolested, in return for the gift of your medical knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to press me instead. And my husband agreed to this...this bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d the young man said, rather dryly. \u201cThe captain of the Artemis, however, perceived the force of my argument.\u201d He blinked down at me, his eyes swollen from days without sleep, the too-big jacket flapping around his slender torso. Despite his youth and his slovenly appearance, he had considerable dignity.</p><p>\u201cI must beg your pardon for what must seem the height of ungentlemanly behavior, Mrs. Malcolm\u2014but the truth is that I am desperate,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou may be our only chance. I must take it.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply, but then closed it. Despite my fury\u2014and my profound unease about what Jamie was going to say when I saw him again\u2014I felt some sympathy for his position. It was quite true that he stood in danger of losing most of his crew, without help. Even with my help, we would lose some\u2014but that wasn\u2019t a prospect I cared to dwell on.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, through my teeth. \u201cAll...right!\u201d I looked out over the rail, at the dwindling sails of the Artemis. I wasn\u2019t prone to seasickness, but I felt a distinct hollowing in the pit of my stomach as the ship\u2014and Jamie\u2014fell far behind. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t appear to have a lot of choice in the matter. If you can spare as many men as possible to scrub down the tween-decks\u2014oh, and have you any alcohol on board?\u201d</p><p>He looked mildly surprised. \u201cAlcohol? Well, there is the rum for the hands\u2019 grog, and possibly some wine from the gun room locker. Will that do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you have, it will have to do.\u201d I tried to push aside my own emotions, long enough to deal with the situation. \u201cI suppose I must speak to the purser, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Come with me.\u201d Leonard started toward the companion-way that led belowdecks, then, flushing, stood back and gestured awkwardly to let me go first\u2014lest my descent expose my lower limbs indelicately, I supposed. Biting my lip with a mixture of anger and amusement, I went.</p><p>I had just reached the bottom of the ladder when I heard a confusion of voices above.</p><p>\u201cNo, I tell \u2019ee, the captain\u2019s not to be disturbed! Whatever you have to say will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave go! I tell you, if you don\u2019t let me speak to him now, it will be too late!\u201d</p><p>And then Leonard\u2019s voice, suddenly sharp as he turned to the interlopers. \u201cStevens? What is this? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter, sir,\u201d said the first voice, suddenly obsequious. \u201cOnly that Tompkins here is sure as he knows the cove what was on that ship\u2014the big \u2019un, with the red hair. He says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t time,\u201d the captain said shortly. \u201cTell the mate, Tompkins, and I shall attend to it later.\u201d</p><p>I was, naturally, halfway back up the ladder by the time these words were spoken, and listening for all I was worth.</p><p>The hatchway darkened as Leonard began the backward descent down the ladder. The young man glanced at me sharply, but I kept my face carefully blank, saying only, \u201cHave you many food stores left, Captain? The sick men will need to be fed very carefully. I don\u2019t suppose there would be any milk saboard, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s milk,\u201d he said, suddenly more cheerful. \u201cWe have six milch goats, in fact. The gunner\u2019s wife, Mrs. Johansen, does quite wonderfully with them. I\u2019ll send her to talk with you, after we\u2019ve seen the purser.\u201d</p><p>Captain Leonard introduced me briefly to Mr. Overholt, the purser, and then left, with the injunction that I should be afforded every possible service. Mr. Overholt, a small, plump man with a bald and shining head, peered at me out of the deep collar of his coat like an undersized Humpty-Dumpty, murmuring unhappily about the scarcity of everything near the end of a cruise, and how unfortunate everything was, but I scarcely attended to him. I was much too agitated, thinking of what I had overheard.</p><p>Who was this Tompkins? The voice was entirely unfamiliar, and I was sure I had never heard the name before. More important, what did he know about Jamie? And what was Captain Leonard likely to do with the information? As it was, there was nothing I could do now, save contain my impatience, and with the half of my mind not busy with fruitless speculation, work out with Mr. Overholt what supplies were available for use in sickroom feeding.</p><p>Not a great deal, as it turned out.</p><p>\u201cNo, they certainly can\u2019t eat salt beef,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cNor yet hardtack, though if we soak the biscuit in boiled milk, perhaps we can manage that as they begin to recover. If you knock the weevils out first,\u201d I added, as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cFish,\u201d Mr. Overholt suggested, in a hopeless sort of way. \u201cWe often encounter substantial schools of mackerel or even bonita, as we approach the Caribbean. Sometimes the crew will have luck with baited lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that would do,\u201d I said, absently. \u201cBoiled milk and water will be enough in the early stages, but as the men begin to recover, they should have something light and nourishing\u2014soup, for instance. I suppose we could make a fish soup? Unless you have something else that might be suitable?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d Mr. Overholt looked profoundly uneasy. \u201cThere is a small quantity of dried figs, ten pound of sugar, some coffee, a quantity of Naples biscuit, and a large cask of Madeira wine, but of course we cannot use that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I stared at him, and he shuffled his feet uneasily.</p><p>\u201cWhy, those supplies are intended for the use of our passenger,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of passenger?\u201d I asked blankly.</p> <p>Mr. Overholt looked surprised. \u201cThe Captain did not tell you? We are carrying the new governor for the island of Jamaica. That is the cause\u2014well, one cause\u201d\u2014he corrected himself, dabbing nervously at his bald head with a handkerchief\u2014\u201cof our haste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not sick, the Governor can eat salt beef,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cBe good for him, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. Now, if you\u2019ll have the wine taken to the galley, I\u2019ve work to do.\u201d</p><p>Aided by one of the remaining midshipmen, a short, stocky youth named Pound, I made a rapid tour of the ship, ruthlessly dragooning supplies and hands. Pound, trotting beside me like a small, ferocious bulldog, firmly informed surprised and resentful cooks, carpenters, sweepers, swabbers, sailmakers, and holdsmen that all my wishes\u2014no matter how unreasonable\u2014must be gratified instantly, by the captain\u2019s orders.</p><p>Quarantine was the most important thing. As soon as the tween-decks had been scrubbed and aired, the patients would have to be carried down again, but the hammocks restrung with plenty of space between\u2014the unaffected crew would have to sleep on deck\u2014and provided with adequate toilet facilities. I had seen a pair of large kettles in the galley that I thought might do. I made a quick note on the mental list I was keeping, and hoped the chief cook was not as possessive of his receptacles as Murphy was.</p><p>I followed Pound\u2019s round head, covered with close-clipped brown curls, down toward the hold in search of worn sails that might be used for cloths. Only half my mind was on my list; with the other half, I was contemplating the possible source of the typhoid outbreak. Caused by a bacillus of the Salmonella genus, it was normally spread by ingestion of the bacillus, carried on hands contaminated by urine or feces.</p> <p>Given the sanitary habits of seamen, any one of the crew could be the carrier of the disease. The most likely culprit was one of the food handlers, though, given the widespread and sudden nature of the outbreak\u2014the cook or one of his two mates, or possibly one of the stewards. I would have to find out how many of these there were, which messes they served, and whether anyone had changed duties four weeks ago\u2014no, five, I corrected myself. The outbreak had begun four weeks ago, but there was an incubation period for the disease to be considered, too.</p><p>\u201cMr. Pound,\u201d I called, and a round face peered up at me from the foot of the ladder.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pound\u2014what\u2019s your first name, by the way?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cElias, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, looking mildly bewildered.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I call you so?\u201d I dropped off the foot of the ladder and smiled at him. He smiled hesitantly back.</p> <p>\u201cEr...no, ma\u2019am. The Captain might mind, though,\u201d he added cautiously. \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t really naval, you know.\u201d</p><p>Elias Pound couldn\u2019t be more than seventeen or eighteen; I doubted that Captain Leonard was more than five or six years older. Still, protocol was protocol.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be very naval in public,\u201d I assured him, suppressing a smile. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to work with me, it will be easier to call you by name.\u201d I knew, as he didn\u2019t, what lay ahead\u2014hours and days and possibly weeks of labor and exhaustion, when the senses would blur, and only bodily habit and blind instinct\u2014and the leadership of a tireless chief\u2014would keep those caring for the sick on their feet.</p><p>I was far from tireless, but the illusion would have to be kept up. This could be done with the help of two or three others, whom I could train; substitutes for my own hands and eyes, who could carry on when I must rest. Fate\u2014and Captain Leonard\u2014had designated Elias Pound as my new right hand; best to be on comfortable terms with him at once.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been at sea, Elias?\u201d I asked, stopping to peer after him as he ducked under a low platform that held enormous loops of a huge, evil-smelling chain, each link more than twice the size of my fist. The anchor chain? I wondered, touching it curiously. It looked strong enough to moor the Queen Elizabeth, which seemed a comforting thought.</p><p>\u201cSince I was seven, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, working his way out backward, dragging a large chest. He stood up puffing slightly from the exertion, and wiped his round, ingenuous face. \u201cMy uncle\u2019s commander in Triton, so he was able to get me a berth in her. I come to join the Porpoise just this voyage, though, out of Edinburgh.\u201d He flipped open the chest, revealing an assortment of rust-smeared surgical implements\u2014at least I hoped it was rust\u2014and a jumbled collection of stoppered bottles and jugs. One of the jars had cracked, and a fine white dust like plaster of Paris lay over everything in the chest.</p><p>\u201cThis is what Mr. Hunter, the surgeon, had with him, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you have use for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d I said, peering into the chest. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a look. Have someone else fetch it up to the sickbay, though, Elias. I need you to come and speak firmly to the cook.\u201d</p> <p>As I oversaw the scrubbing of the tween-decks with boiling seawater, my mind was occupied with several distinct trains of thought.</p><p>First, I was mentally charting the necessary steps to take in combating the disease. Two men, far gone from dehydration and malaise, had died during the removal from the tween-decks, and now lay at the far end of the after-deck, where the sailmaker was industriously stitching them into their hammocks for burial, a pair of round shot sewn in at their feet. Four more weren\u2019t going to make it through the night. The remaining forty-five had chances ranging from excellent to slim; with luck and skill, I might save most of them. But how many new cases were brewing, undetected, among the remaining crew?</p><p>Huge quantities of water were boiling in the galley at my order; hot seawater for cleansing, boiled fresh water for drinking. I made another tick on my mental list; I must see Mrs. Johansen, she of the milch goats, and arrange for the milk to be sterilized as well.</p><p>I must interview the galley hands about their duties; if a single source of infection could be found and isolated, it would do a lot to halt the spread of the disease. Tick.</p><p>All of the available alcohol on the ship was being gathered in the sickbay, to the profound horror of Mr. Overholt. It could be used in its present form, but it would be better to have purified alcohol. Could a means be found of distilling it? Check with the purser. Tick.</p><p>All the hammocks must be boiled and dried before the healthy hands slept in them. That would have to be done quickly, before the next watch went to its rest. Send Elias for a crew of swabbers and sweepers; laundry duty seemed most in their line. Tick.</p><p>Under the growing mental list of necessities were vague but continuing thoughts of the mysterious Tompkins and his unknown information. Whatever it was, it had not resulted in our changing course to return to the Artemis. Either Captain Leonard had not taken it seriously, or he was simply too eager to get to Jamaica to allow anything to hinder his progress.</p><p>I had paused for a moment by the rail, to organize my thoughts. I pushed back the hair from my forehead, and lifted my face to the cleansing wind, letting it blow away the stench of sickness. Puffs of ill-smelling steam rose from the nearby hatchway, from the hot-water cleansing going on below. It would be better down there when they had finished, but a long way from fresh air.</p><p>I looked out over the rail, hoping vainly for the glimpse of a sail, but the Porpoise was alone, the Artemis\u2014and Jamie\u2014left far behind.</p><p>I pushed away the sudden rush of loneliness and panic. I must speak soon with Captain Leonard. Answers to two, at least, of the problems that concerned me lay with him; the possible source of the typhoid outbreak\u2014and the role of the unknown Mr. Tompkins in Jamie\u2019s affairs. But for the moment, there were more pressing matters.</p><p>\u201cElias!\u201d I called, knowing he would be somewhere within reach of my voice. \u201cTake me to Mrs. Johansen and the goats, please.\u201d</p><p>47</p><p>PLAGUE SHIP</p><p>Two days later, I had still not found time to speak to Captain Leonard. Twice, I had gone to his cabin, but found the young Captain gone or unavailable\u2014taking position, I was told, or consulting charts, or otherwise engaged in some bit of sailing arcana.</p><p>Mr. Overholt had taken to avoiding me and my insatiable demands, locking himself in his cabin with a pomander of dried sage and hyssop tied round his neck to ward off plague. The able-bodied crewmen assigned to the work of cleaning and shifting had been lethargic and dubious at first, but I had chivvied and scolded, glared and shouted, stamped my foot and shrieked, and got them gradually moving. I felt more like a sheepdog than a doctor\u2014snapping and growling at their heels, and hoarse now with the effort.</p><p>It was working, though; there was a new feeling of hope and purpose among the crew\u2014I could feel it. Four new deaths today, and ten new cases reporting, but the sounds of groaning distress from the tween-decks were much less, and the faces of the still-healthy showed the relief that comes of doing something\u2014anything. I had so far failed to find the source of the contagion. If I could do that, and prevent any fresh outbreaks, I might\u2014just possibly\u2014halt the devastation within a week, while the Porpoise still had hands enough to sail her.</p><p>A quick canvass of the surviving crew had turned up two men pressed from a county gaol where they had been imprisoned for brewing illicit liquor. I had seized on these gratefully and put them to work building a still in which\u2014to the horror of the crew\u2014half the ship\u2019s store of rum was being distilled into pure alcohol for disinfection.</p><p>I had posted one of the surviving midshipmen by the entrance to the sickbay and another by the galley, each armed with a basin of pure alcohol and instructions to see that no one went in or came out without dipping their hands. Beside each midshipman stood a marine with his rifle, charged with the duty of seeing that no one should drink the grimy contents of the barrel into which the used alcohol was emptied when it became too filthy to be used any longer.</p><p>In Mrs. Johansen, the gunner\u2019s wife, I had found an unexpected ally.

I wiped the back of a hand across my brow, trying to get my hair out of my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t mean to offend your tender ears, Elias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard it before, ma\u2019am,\u201d Elias assured me. \u201cJust not from a lady, like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a lady, Elias,\u201d I said tiredly. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor. Have someone go and search the ship for whoever it was; they\u2019ll likely be unconscious by now.\u201d He nodded and whirled on one foot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look in the cable tier,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they usually hide when they\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>This was the fourth in the last three days. Despite all guards set over the still and the purified alcohol, the hands, living on half their usual daily ration of grog, were so desperate for drink that they contrived somehow to get at the pure grain alcohol meant for sterilization.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d the purser had said, shaking his bald head when I complained about the problem. \u201cSeamen will drink anything, ma\u2019am! Spoilt plum brandy, peaches mashed inside a rubber boot and left to ferment\u2014why, I\u2019ve even known a hand caught stealing the old bandages from the surgeon\u2019s quarters and soaking them, in hopes of getting a whiff of alcohol. No, ma\u2019am, telling them that drinking it will kill them certainly won\u2019t stop them.\u201d</p><p>Kill them it did. One of the four men who had drunk it had died; two more were in their own boarded-off section of the sickbay, deeply comatose. If they survived, they were likely to be permanently brain-damaged.</p> <p>\u201cNot that being on a bloody floating hellhole like this isn\u2019t likely to brain-damage anyone,\u201d I remarked bitterly to a tern who alighted on the rail nearby. \u201cAs if it isn\u2019t enough, trying to save half the miserable lot from typhoid, now the other half is trying to kill themselves with my alcohol! Damn the bloody lot of them!\u201d</p><p>The tern cocked its head, decided I was not edible, and flew away. The ocean stretched empty all around\u2014before us, where the unknown West Indies concealed Young Ian\u2019s fate, and behind, where Jamie and the Artemis had long since vanished. And me in the middle, with six hundred drink-mad English sailors and a hold full of inflamed bowels.</p><p>I stood fuming for a moment, then turned with decision toward the forward gangway. I didn\u2019t care if Captain Leonard was personally pumping the bilges, he was going to talk to me.</p><p>I stopped just inside the door of the cabin. It was not yet noon, but the Captain was asleep, head pillowed on his forearms, on top of an outspread book. The quill had fallen from his fingers, and the glass inkstand, cleverly held in its anchored bracket, swayed gently with the motion of the ship. His face was turned to the side, cheek pressed flat on his arm. Despite the heavy beard stubble, he looked absurdly young.</p><p>I turned, meaning to come back later, but in moving, brushed against the locker, where a stack of books was precariously balanced amid a rubble of papers, navigational instruments, and half-rolled charts. The top volume fell with a thump to the deck.</p><p>The sound was scarcely audible above the general sounds of creaking, flapping, whining rigging, and shouting that made up the background of life on shipboard, but it brought him awake, blinking and looking startled.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Fra\u2014Mrs. Malcolm!\u201d he said. He rubbed a hand over his face, and shook his head quickly, trying to wake himself. \u201cWhat\u2014that is\u2014you required something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I do need more alcohol\u2014if necessary, I can use straight rum\u2014and you really must speak to the hands, to see if there is some way of stopping them trying to drink the distilled alcohol. We\u2019ve had another that\u2019s poisoned himself today. And if there\u2019s any way of bringing more fresh air down to the sickbay...\u201d I stopped, seeing that I was overwhelming him.</p><p>He blinked and scratched, slowly pulling his thoughts into order. The buttons on his sleeve had left two round red imprints on his cheek, and his hair was flattened on that side.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, rather stupidly. Then, as he began to wake, his expression cleared. \u201cYes. Of course. I will give orders to have a windsail rigged, to bring more air below. As for the alcohol\u2014I must beg leave to consult the purser, as I do not myself know our present capacities in that regard.\u201d He turned and took a breath, as though to shout, but then remembered that his steward was no longer within earshot, being now below in the sickbay. Just then, the ting of the ship\u2019s bell came faintly from above.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d he said, politeness recovered. \u201cIt is nearly noon; I must go and take our position. I will send the purser to you, should you care to remain here for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I sat down in the chair he had just vacated. He turned to go, making an attempt to straighten the too-large braided coat over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Leonard?\u201d I said, moved by a sudden impulse. He turned back, questioning.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking\u2014how old are you?\u201d</p> <p>He blinked and his face tightened, but he answered me.</p><p>\u201cI am nineteen, ma\u2019am. Your servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d And with that, he vanished through the door. I could hear him in the companionway, calling out in a voice half-cracked with fatigue.</p><p>Nineteen! I sat quite still, paralyzed with shock. I had thought him very young, but not nearly that young. His face weathered from exposure and lined with strain and sleeplessness, he had looked to be at least in his mid-twenties. My God! I thought, appalled. He\u2019s no more than a baby!</p><p>Nineteen. Just Brianna\u2019s age. And to be suddenly thrust into command not only of a ship\u2014and not just a ship, but an English man-of-war\u2014and not merely a man-of-war, but one with a plague aboard that had deprived her suddenly of a quarter of her crew and virtually all her command\u2014I felt the fright and fury that had bubbled inside me for the last few days begin to ebb, as I realized that the high-handedness that had led him to kidnap me was in fact not arrogance or ill-judgment, but the result of sheer desperation.</p><p>He had to have help, he had said. Well, he was right, and I was it. I took a deep breath, visualizing the mess I had left behind in the sickbay. That was mine, and mine alone, to do the best I could with.</p><p>Captain Leonard had left the logbook open on the desk, his entry half-complete. There was a small damp spot on the page; he had drooled slightly in his sleep. In a spasm of irritated pity, I flipped over the page, wishing to hide this further evidence of his vulnerability.</p><p>My eye caught a word on the new page, and I stopped, a chill snaking down from the nape of my neck as I remembered something. When I had wakened him unexpectedly, the captain had started up, seen me, and said, \u201cMrs. Fra\u2014\u201d before catching himself. And the name on the page before me, the word that had caught my attention, was \u201cFraser.\u201d He knew who I was\u2014and who Jamie was.</p><p>I rose quickly and shut the door, dropping the bolt. At least I would have warning if anyone came. Then I sat down at the captain\u2019s desk, pressed flat the pages, and began to read.</p><p>I flipped back to find the record of the meeting with the Artemis, three days before. Captain Leonard\u2019s entries were distinct from those of his predecessor, and mostly quite brief\u2014not surprising, considering how much he had had to deal with of late. Most entries contained only the usual navigational information, with a brief note of the names of those men who had died since the previous day. The meeting with the Artemis was noted, though, and my own presence.</p><p>3 February, 1767. Met near eight bells with Artemis, a small two-masted brig under French colors. Hailed her and requested the assistance of her surgeon, C. Malcolm, who was taken on board and remains with us to assist with the sick.</p><p>C. Malcolm, eh? No mention of my being a woman; perhaps he thought it irrelevant, or wished to avoid any inquiries over the propriety of his actions. I went on to the next entry.</p><p>4 February 1767. I have rec\u2019d information this day from Harry Tompkins, able seaman, that the supercargo of the brig Artemis is known to him as a criminal by the name of James Fraser, known also by the names of Jamie Roy and of Alexander Malcolm. This Fraser is a seditionist, and a notorious smuggler, for whose capture a substantial reward is offered by the King\u2019s Customs. Information was received from Tompkins after we had parted company with Artemis; I thought it not expeditious to pursue Artemis, as we are ordered with all possible dispatch for Jamaica, because of our passenger. However, as I have promised to return the Artemis\u2019s surgeon to them there, Fraser may be arrested at that time.</p><p>Two men dead of the plague\u2014which the Artemis\u2019s surgeon informs me is the Typhoide. Jno. Jaspers, able seaman, DD, Harty Kepple, cook\u2019s mate, DD.</p><p>That was all; the next day\u2019s entry was confined entirely to navigation and the recording of the death of six men, all with \u201cDD\u201d written beside their names. I wondered what it meant, but was too distracted to worry about it.</p><p>I heard steps coming down the passageway, and barely got the bolt lifted before the purser\u2019s knock sounded on the door. I scarcely heard Mr. Overholt\u2019s apologies; my mind was too busy trying to make sense of this new revelation.</p><p>Who in blinking, bloody hell was this man Tompkins? No one I had ever seen or heard about, I was sure, and yet he obviously knew a dangerous amount about Jamie\u2019s activities. Which led to two questions: How had an English seaman come by such information\u2014and who else knew it?</p><p>\u201c...cut the grog rations further, to give you an additional cask of rum,\u201d Mr. Overholt was saying dubiously. \u201cThe hands won\u2019t like it, but we might manage; we\u2019re only two weeks out of Jamaica now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether they like it or not, I need the alcohol more than they need grog,\u201d I answered brusquely. \u201cIf they complain too much, tell them if I don\u2019t have the rum, none of them may make it to Jamaica.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Overholt sighed, and wiped small beads of sweat from his shiny brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, too beaten down to object.</p><p>\u201cFine. Oh, Mr. Overholt?\u201d He turned back, questioning. \u201cWhat does the legend \u2018DD\u2019 mean? I saw the Captain write it in his log.\u201d</p><p>A small flicker of humor lighted in the purser\u2019s deep-sunk eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt means \u2018Discharged, Dead,\u2019 ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe only sure way for most of us, of leaving His Majesty\u2019s Navy.\u201d</p><p>As I oversaw the bathing of bodies and the constant infusions of sweetened water and boiled milk, my mind continued to work on the problem of the unknown Tompkins.</p><p>I knew nothing of the man, save his voice. He might be one of the faceless horde overhead, the silhouettes that I saw in the rigging when I came up on deck for air, or one of the hurrying anonymous bodies, hurtling up and down the decks in a vain effort to do the work of three men.</p><p>I would meet him, of course, if he became infected; I knew the names of each patient in the sickbay. But I could hardly allow the matter to wait, in the rather ghoulish hope that Tompkins would contract typhoid. At last I made up my mind to ask; the man presumably knew who I was, anyway. Even if he found out that I had been asking about him, it was unlikely to do any harm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elias was the natural place to begin. I waited until the end of the day to ask, trusting to fatigue to dull his natural curiosity.</p><p>\u201cTompkins?\u201d The boy\u2019s round face drew together in a brief frown, then cleared. \u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am. One o\u2019 the forecastle hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he come aboard, do you know?\u201d There was no good way of accounting for this sudden interest in a man I had never met, but luckily, Elias was much too tired to wonder about it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said vaguely, \u201cat Spithead, I think. Or\u2014no! I remember now, \u2019twas Edinburgh.\u201d He rubbed his knuckles under his nose to stifle a yawn. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Edinburgh. I wouldn\u2019 remember, only he was a pressed man, and a unholy fuss he made about it, claimin\u2019 as how they couldn\u2019 press him, he was protected, account of he worked for Sir Percival Turner, in the Customs.\u201d The yawn got the better of him and he gaped widely, then subsided. \u201cBut he didn\u2019 have no written protection from Sir Percival,\u201d he concluded, blinking, \u201cso there wasn\u2019 nothing to be done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Customs agent, was he?\u201d That went quite some way toward explaining things, all right.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. Yes, mum, I mean.\u201d Elias was trying manfully to stay awake, but his glazing eyes were fixed on the swaying lantern at the end of the sickbay, and he was swaying with it.</p><p>\u201cYou go on to bed, Elias,\u201d I said, taking pity on him. \u201cI\u2019ll finish here.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head quickly, trying to shake off sleep.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, ma\u2019am! I ain\u2019t sleepy, not a bit!\u201d He reached clumsily for the cup and bottle I held. \u201cYou give me that, mum, and go to rest yourself.\u201d He would not be moved, but stubbornly insisted on helping to administer the last round of water before staggering off to his cot.</p> <p>I was nearly as tired as Elias by the time we finished, but sleep would not come. I lay in the dead surgeon\u2019s cabin, staring up at the shadowy beam above my head, listening to the creak and rumble of the ship about me, wondering.</p><p>So Tompkins worked for Sir Percival. And Sir Percival assuredly knew that Jamie was a smuggler. But was there more to it than that? Tompkins knew Jamie by sight. How? And if Sir Percival had been willing to tolerate Jamie\u2019s clandestine activities in return for bribes, then\u2014well, perhaps none of those bribes had made it to Tompkins\u2019s pockets. But in that case...and what about the ambush at Arbroath cove? Was there a traitor among the smugglers? And if so...</p><p>My thoughts were losing coherence, spinning in circles like the revolutions of a dying top. The powdered white face of Sir Percival faded into the purple mask of the hanged Customs agent on the Arbroath road, and the gold and red flames of an exploding lantern lit the crevices of my mind. I rolled onto my stomach, clutching the pillow to my chest, the last thought in my mind that I must find Tompkins.</p><p>As it was, Tompkins found me. For more than two days, the situation in the sickbay was too pressing for me to leave for more than the barest space of time. On the third day, though, matters seemed easier, and I retired to the surgeon\u2019s cabin, intending to wash myself and rest briefly before the midday drum beat for the noon meal.</p><p>I was lying on the cot, a cool cloth over my tired eyes, when I heard the sound of bumping and voices in the passage outside my door. A tentative knock sounded on my door, and an unfamiliar voice said, \u201cMrs. Malcolm? There\u2019s been a h\u2019accident, if you please, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>I swung open the door to find two seamen supporting a third, who stood storklike on one leg, his face white with shock and pain.</p> <p>It took no more than a single glance for me to know whom I was looking at. The man\u2019s face was ridged down one side with the livid scars of a bad burn, and the twisted eyelid on that side exposed the milky lens of a blind eye, had I needed any further confirmation that here stood the one-eyed seaman Young Ian had thought he\u2019d killed, lank brown hair grew back from a balding brow to a scrawny pigtail that drooped over one shoulder, exposing a pair of large, transparent ears.</p><p>\u201cMr. Tompkins,\u201d I said with certainty, and his remaining eye widened in surprise. \u201cPut him down over there, please.\u201d</p><p>The men deposited Tompkins on a stool by the wall, and went back to their work; the ship was too shorthanded to allow for distraction. Heart beating heavily, I knelt down to examine the wounded leg.</p><p>He knew who I was, all right; I had seen it in his face when I opened the door. There was a great deal of tension in the leg under my hand. The injury was gory, but not serious, given suitable care; a deep gash scored down the calf of the leg. It had bled substantially, but there were no deep arteries cut; it had been well-wrapped with a piece of someone\u2019s shirt, and the bleeding had nearly stopped when I unwound the homemade bandage.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do this, Mr. Tompkins?\u201d I asked, standing up and reaching for the bottle of alcohol. He glanced up, his single eye alert and wary.</p><p>\u201cSplinter wound, ma\u2019am,\u201d he answered, in the nasal tones I had heard once before. \u201cA spar broke as I was a-standing on it.\u201d The tip of his tongue stole out, furtively wetting his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I turned and flipped open the lid of my empty medicine box, pretending to survey the available remedies. I studied him out of the corner of one eye, while I tried to think how best to approach him. He was on his guard; tricking him into revelations or winning his trust were clearly out of the question.</p><p>My eyes flicked over the tabletop, seeking inspiration. And found it. With a mental apology to the shade of Aesculapius the physician, I picked up the late surgeon\u2019s bone-saw, a wicked thing some eighteen inches long, a rust-flecked steel. I looked at this thoughtfully, turned, and laid the toothed edge of the instrument gently against the injured leg, just above the knee. I smiled charmingly into the seaman\u2019s terrified single eye.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Tompkins,\u201d I said, \u201clet us talk frankly.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, able-bodied seaman Tompkins had been restored to his hammock, stitched and bandaged, shaking in every limb, but able-bodied still. For my part, I felt a little shaky as well.</p><p>Tompkins was, as he had insisted to the press-gang in Edinburgh, an agent of Sir Percival Turner. In that capacity, he went about the docks and warehouses of all the shipping ports in the Firth of Forth, from Culross and Donibristle to Restalrig and Musselburgh, picking up gossip and keeping his beady eye sharp-peeled to catch any evidence of unlawful activity.</p><p>The attitude of Scots toward English tax laws being what it was, there was no lack of such activity to report. What was done with such reports, though, varied. Small smugglers, caught red-handed with a bottle or two of unbonded rum or whisky, might be summarily arrested, tried and convicted, and sentenced to anything from penal servitude to transportation, with forfeiture of all their property to the Crown.</p><p>The bigger fish, though, were reserved to Sir Percival\u2019s private judgment. In other words, allowed to pay substantial bribes for the privilege of continuing their operations under the blind eye (here Tompkins laughed sardonically, touching the ruined side of his face) of the King\u2019s agents.</p><p>\u201cSir Percival\u2019s got ambitions, see?\u201d While not noticeably relaxed, Tompkins had at least unbent enough to lean forward, one eye narrowing as he gestured in explanation. \u201cHe\u2019s in with Dundas and all them. Everything goes right, and he might have a peerage, not just a knighthood, eh? But that\u2019ll take more than money.\u201d</p><p>One thing that could help was some spectacular demonstration of competence and service to the Crown.</p><p>\u201cAs in the sort of arrest that might make \u2019em sit up and take notice, eh? Ooh! That smarts, missus. You sure of what you\u2019re a-doing of, there?\u201d Tompkins squinted dubiously downward, to where I was sponging the site of the injury with dilute alcohol.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I said. \u201cGo on, then. I suppose a simple smuggler wouldn\u2019t have been good enough, no matter how big?\u201d</p><p>Evidently not. However, when word had reached Sir Percival that there might just possibly be a major political criminal within his grasp, the old gentleman had nearly blown a gasket with excitement.</p><p>\u201cBut sedition\u2019s a harder thing to prove than smuggling, eh? You catch one of the little fish with the goods, and they\u2019re saying not a thing will lead you further on. Idealists, them seditionists,\u201d Tompkins said, shaking his head with disgust. \u201cNever rat on each other, they don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t know who you were looking for?\u201d I stood and took one of my cat-gut sutures from its jar, threading it through a needle. I caught Tompkins\u2019s apprehensive look, but did nothing to allay his anxiety. I wanted him anxious\u2014and voluble.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t know who the big fish was\u2014not until another of Sir Percival\u2019s agents had the luck to tumble to one of Fraser\u2019s associates, what gave \u2019em the tip he was Malcolm the printer, and told his real name. Then it all come clear, o\u2019 course.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cWho was the associate?\u201d I asked. The names and faces of the six smugglers darted through my mind\u2014little fish. Not idealists, any of them. But to which of them was loyalty no bar?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. No, it\u2019s true, missus, I swear! Ow!\u201d he said frantically as I jabbed the needle under the skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hurt you,\u201d I assured him, in as false a voice as I could muster. \u201cI have to stitch the wound, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Ow! I don\u2019t know, to be sure I don\u2019t! I\u2019d tell, if I did, as God\u2019s my witness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would,\u201d I said, intent on my stitching.</p><p>\u201cOh! Please, missus! Stop! Just for a moment! All I know is it was an Englishman! That\u2019s all!\u201d</p><p>I stopped, and stared up at him. \u201cAn Englishman?\u201d I said blankly.</p><p>\u201cYes, missus. That\u2019s what Sir Percival said.\u201d He looked down at me, tears trembling on the lashes of both his eyes. I took the final stitch, as gently as I could, and tied the suture knot. Without speaking, I got up, poured a small tot of brandy from my private bottle, and handed it to him.</p><p>He gulped it gratefully, and seemed much restored in consequence. Whether out of gratitude, or sheer relief for the end of the ordeal, he told me the rest of the story. In search of evidence to support a charge of sedition, he had gone to the printshop in Carfax Close.</p><p>\u201cI know what happened there,\u201d I assured him. I turned his face toward the light, examining the burn scars. \u201cIs it still painful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Missus, but it hurt precious bad for some time,\u201d he said. Being incapacitated by his injuries, Tompkins had taken no part in the ambush at Arbroath cove, but he had heard\u2014\u201cnot direct-like, but I heard, you know,\u201d he said, with a shrewd nod of the head\u2014what had happened.</p><p>Sir Percival had given Jamie warning of an ambush, to lessen the chances of Jamie\u2019s thinking him involved in the affair, and possibly revealing the details of their financial arrangements in quarters where such revelations would be detrimental to Sir Percival\u2019s interests.</p><p>At the same time, Sir Percival had learned\u2014from the associate, the mysterious Englishman\u2014of the fallback arrangement with the French delivery vessel, and had arranged the grave-ambush on the beach at Arbroath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut what about the Customs officer who was killed on the road?\u201d I asked sharply.

There were only five men among the smugglers who could possibly have done it, and none of them are Englishmen!\u201d</p><p>Tompkins rubbed a hand over his mouth; he seemed to be debating the wisdom of telling me or not. I picked up the brandy bottle and set it by his elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019m much obliged, Missus Fraser! You\u2019re a true Christian, missus, and so I shall tell anyone who asks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkip the testimonials,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cJust tell me what you know about the Customs officer.\u201d</p> <p>He filled the cup and drained it, sipping slowly. Then, with a sigh of satisfaction, he set it down and licked his lips.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t none of the smugglers done him in, missus. It was his own mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I jerked back, startled, but he nodded, blinking his good eye in token of sincerity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, missus. There was two of \u2019em, wasn\u2019t there? Well, the one of them had his instructions, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>The instructions had been to wait until whatever smugglers escaped the ambush on the beach had reached the road, whereupon the Customs officer was to drop a noose over his partner\u2019s head in the dark and strangle him swiftly, then string him up and leave him, as evidence of the smugglers\u2019 murderous wrath.</p> <p>\u201cBut why?\u201d I said, bewildered and horrified. \u201cWhat was the point of doing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not see?\u201d Tompkins looked surprised, as though the logic of the situation should be obvious. \u201cWe\u2019d failed to get the evidence from the printshop that would have proved the case of sedition against Fraser, and with the shop burnt to the ground, no possibility of another chance. Nor had we ever caught Fraser red-handed with the goods himself, only some of the small fish who worked for him. One of the other agents thought he\u2019d a clue where the stuff was kept, but something happened to him\u2014perhaps Fraser caught him or bought him off, for he disappeared one day in November, and wasn\u2019t heard of again, nor the hiding place for the contraband, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I swallowed, thinking of the man who had accosted me on the stairs of the brothel. What had become of that cask of cr\u00e8me de menthe? \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m telling you, missus, just you wait.\u201d Tompkins raised a monitory hand. \u201cSo\u2014here\u2019s Sir Percival, knowing as he\u2019s got a rare case, with a man\u2019s not only one of the biggest smugglers on the Firth, and the author of some of the most first-rate seditious material it\u2019s been my privilege to see, but is also a pardoned Jacobite traitor, whose name will make the trial a sensation from one end of the kingdom to the other. The only trouble being\u201d\u2014he shrugged\u2014\u201cas there\u2019s no evidence.\u201d</p><p>It began to make a hideous sort of sense, as Tompkins explained the plan. The murder of a Customs officer killed in pursuit of duty would not only make any smuggler arrested for the crime subject to a capital charge, but was the sort of heinous crime that would cause a major public outcry. The matter-of-fact acceptance that smugglers enjoyed from the populace would not protect them in a matter of such callous villainy.</p><p>\u201cYour Sir Percival has got the makings of a really first-class son of a bitch,\u201d I observed. Tompkins nodded meditatively, blinking into his cup.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve the right of it there, missus, I\u2019ll not say you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Customs officer who was killed\u2014I suppose he was just a convenience?\u201d</p><p>Tompkins sniggered, with a fine spray of brandy. His one eye seemed to be having some trouble focusing.</p><p>\u201cOh, very convenient, Missus, more ways than one. Don\u2019t you grieve none on his account. There was a good many folk glad enough to see Tom Oakie swing\u2014and not the least of \u2019em, Sir Percival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I finished fastening the bandage about his calf. It was getting late; I would have to get back to the sickbay soon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better call someone to take you to your hammock,\u201d I said, taking the nearly empty bottle from his unresisting hand. \u201cYou should rest your leg for at least three days; tell your officer I said you can\u2019t go aloft until I\u2019ve taken out the stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that, missus, and I thank you for your kindness to a poor unfortunate sailor.\u201d Tompkins made an abortive attempt to stand, looking surprised when he failed. I got a hand under his armpit and heaved, getting him on his feet, and\u2014he declining my offer to summon him assistance\u2014helped him to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about Harry Tompkins, missus,\u201d he said, weaving unsteadily into the corridor. He turned and gave me an exaggerated wink. \u201cOld Harry always ends up all right, no matter what.\u201d Looking at him, with his long nose, pink-tipped from liquor, his large, transparent ears, and his single sly brown eye, it came to me suddenly what he reminded me of.</p> <p>\u201cWhen were you born, Mr. Tompkins?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He blinked for a moment, uncomprehending, but then said, \u201cThe Year of our Lord 1713, missus. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason,\u201d I said, and waved him off, watching as he caromed slowly down the corridor, dropping out of sight at the ladder like a bag of oats. I would have to check with Mr. Willoughby to be sure, but at the moment, I would have wagered my chemise that 1713 had been a Year of the Rat.</p><p>48</p><p>MOMENT OF GRACE</p><p>Over the next few days, a routine set in, as it does in even the most desperate circumstances, provided that they continue long enough. The hours after a battle are urgent and chaotic, with men\u2019s lives hanging on a second\u2019s action. Here a doctor can be heroic, knowing for certain that the wound just stanched has saved a life, that the quick intervention will save a limb. But in an epidemic, there is none of that.</p><p>Then come the long days of constant watching and battles fought on the field of germs\u2014and with no weapons suited to that field, it can be no more than a battle of delay, doing the small things that may not help but must be done, over and over and over again, fighting the invisible enemy of disease, in the tenuous hope that the body can be supported long enough to outlast its attacker.</p><p>To fight disease without medicine is to push against a shadow; a darkness that spreads as inexorably as night. I had been fighting for nine days, and forty-six more men were dead.</p><p>Still, I rose each day at dawn, splashed water into my grainy eyes, and went once more to the field of war, unarmed with anything save persistence\u2014and a barrel of alcohol.</p><p>There were some victories, but even these left a bitter taste in my mouth. I found the likely source of infection\u2014one of the messmates, a man named Howard. First serving on board as a member of one of the gun crews, Howard had been transferred to galley duty six weeks before, the result of an accident with a recoiling gun-carriage that had crushed several fingers.</p><p>Howard had served the gun room, and the first known case of the disease\u2014taken from the incomplete records of the dead surgeon, Mr. Hunter\u2014was one of the marines who messed there. Four more cases, all from the gun room, and then it had begun to spread, as infected but still ambulatory men left the deadly contamination smeared in the ship\u2019s heads, to be picked up there and passed to the crew at large.</p><p>Howard\u2019s admission that he had seen sickness like this before, on other ships where he had served, was enough to clinch the matter. However, the cook, shorthanded as everyone else aboard, had declined absolutely to part with a valuable hand, only because of \u201ca goddamned female\u2019s silly notion!\u201d</p><p>Elias could not persuade him, and I had been obliged to summon the captain himself, who\u2014misunderstanding the nature of the disturbance, had arrived with several armed marines. There was a most unpleasant scene in the galley, and Howard was removed to the brig\u2014the only place of certain quarantine\u2014protesting in bewilderment, and demanding to know his crime.</p><p>As I came up from the galley, the sun was going down into the ocean in a blaze that paved the western sea with gold like the streets of Heaven. I stopped for a moment, just a moment, transfixed by the sight.</p><p>It had happened many times before, but it always took me by surprise. Always in the midst of great stress, wading waist-deep in trouble and sorrow, as doctors do, I would glance out a window, open a door, look into a face, and there it would be, unexpected and unmistakable. A moment of peace.</p><p>The light spread from the sky to the ship, and the great horizon was no longer a blank threat of emptiness, but the habitation of joy. For a moment, I lived in the center of the sun, warmed and cleansed, and the smell and sight of sickness fell away; the bitterness lifted from my heart.</p><p>I never looked for it, gave it no name; yet I knew it always, when the gift of peace came. I stood quite still for the moment that it lasted, thinking it strange and not strange that grace should find me here, too.</p><p>Then the light shifted slightly and the moment passed, leaving me as it always did, with the lasting echo of its presence. In a reflex of acknowledgment, I crossed myself and went below, my tarnished armor faintly gleaming.</p><p>Elias Pound died of the typhoid four days later. It was a virulent infection; he came to the sickbay heavy-eyed with fever and wincing at the light; six hours later he was delirious and unable to rise. The next dawn he pressed his cropped round head against my bosom, called me \u201cMother,\u201d and died in my arms.</p><p>I did what had to be done throughout the day, and stood by Captain Leonard at sunset, when he read the burial service. The body of Midshipman Pound was consigned to the sea, wrapped in his hammock.</p><p>I declined the Captain\u2019s invitation to dinner, and went instead to sit in a remote corner of the afterdeck, next to one of the great guns, where I could look out over the water, showing my face to no one. The sun went down in gold and glory, succeeded by a night of starred velvet, but there was no moment of grace, no peace in either sight for me.</p><p>As the darkness settled over the ship, all her movements began to slow. I leaned my head against the gun, the polished metal cool under my cheek. A seaman passed me at a fast walk, intent on his duties, and then I was alone.</p><p>I ached desperately; my head throbbed, my back was stiff and my feet swollen, but none of these was of any significance, compared to the deeper ache that knotted my heart.</p><p>Any doctor hates to lose a patient. Death is the enemy, and to lose someone in your care to the clutch of the dark angel is to be vanquished yourself, to feel the rage of betrayal and impotence, beyond the common, human grief of loss and the horror of death\u2019s finality. I had lost twenty-three men between dawn and sunset of this day. Elias was only the first.</p><p>Several had died as I sponged their bodies or held their hands; others, alone in their hammocks, had died uncomforted even by a touch, because I could not reach them in time. I thought I had resigned myself to the realities of this time, but knowing\u2014even as I held the twitching body of an eighteen-year-old seaman as his bowels dissolved in blood and water\u2014that penicillin would have saved most of them, and I had none, was galling as an ulcer, eating at my soul.</p><p>The box of syringes and ampules had been left behind on the Artemis, in the pocket of my spare skirt. If I had had it, I could not have used it. If I had used it, I could have saved no more than one or two. But even knowing that, I raged at the futility of it all, clenching my teeth until my jaw ached as I went from man to man, armed with nothing but boiled milk and biscuit, and my two empty hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mind followed the same dizzying lines my feet had traveled earlier, seeing faces\u2014faces contorted in anguish or smoothing slowly in the slackness of death, but all of them looking at me. At me. I lifted my futile hand and slammed it hard against the rail. I did it again, and again, scarcely feeling the sting of the blows, in a frenzy of furious rage and grief.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d a voice spoke behind me, and a hand seized my wrist, preventing me from slapping the rail yet again.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d I struggled, but his grip was too strong.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said again, firmly. His other arm came around my waist, and he pulled me back, away from the rail. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t bloody care!\u201d I wrenched against his grasp, but then slumped, defeated. What did it matter?</p><p>He let go of me then, and I turned to find myself facing a man I had never seen before. He wasn\u2019t a sailor; while his clothes were crumpled and stale with long wear, they had originally been very fine; the dove-gray coat and waistcoat had been tailored to flatter his slender frame, and the wilted lace at his throat had come from Brussels.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d I said in astonishment. I brushed at my wet cheeks, sniffed, and made an instinctive effort to smooth down my hair. I hoped the shadows hid my face.</p><p>He smiled slightly, and handed me a handkerchief, crumpled, but clean.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Grey,\u201d he said, with a small, courtly bow. \u201cI expect that you must be the famous Mrs. Malcolm, whose heroism Captain Leonard has been so strongly praising.\u201d I grimaced at that, and he paused.</p> <p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cHave I said something amiss? My apologies, Madame, I had no notion of offering you offense.\u201d He looked anxious at the thought, and I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt is not heroic to watch men die,\u201d I said. My words were thick, and I stopped to blow my nose. \u201cI\u2019m just here, that\u2019s all. Thank you for the handkerchief.\u201d I hesitated, not wanting to hand the used handkerchief back to him, but not wanting simply to pocket it, either. He solved the dilemma with a dismissive wave of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMight I do anything else for you?\u201d He hesitated, irresolute. \u201cA cup of water? Some brandy, perhaps?\u201d He fumbled in his coat, drawing out a small silver pocket flask engraved with a coat of arms, which he offered to me.</p><p>I took it, with a nod of thanks, and took a swallow deep enough to make me cough. It burned down the back of my throat, but I sipped again, more cautiously this time, and felt it warm me, easing and strengthening. I breathed deeply and drank again. It helped.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, a little hoarsely, handing back the flask. That seemed somewhat abrupt, and I added, \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that brandy is good to drink; I\u2019ve been using it to wash people in the sickbay.\u201d The statement brought back the events of the day to me with crushing vividness, and I sagged back onto the powder box where I had been sitting.</p><p>\u201cI take it the plague continues unabated?\u201d he asked quietly. He stood in front of me, the glow of a nearby lantern shining on his dark blond hair.</p> <p>\u201cNot unabated, no.\u201d I closed my eyes, feeling unutterably bleak. \u201cThere was only one new case today. There were four the day before, and six the day before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds hopeful,\u201d he observed. \u201cAs though you are defeating the disease.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly. It felt dense and heavy as one of the cannonballs piled in the shallow bins by the guns.</p><p>\u201cNo. All we\u2019re doing is to stop more men being infected. There isn\u2019t a bloody thing I can do for the ones who already have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He stooped and picked up one of my hands. Surprised, I let him have it. He ran a thumb lightly over the blister where I had burned myself scalding milk, and touched my knuckles, reddened and cracked from the constant immersion in alcohol.</p><p>\u201cYou would appear to have been very active, Madame, for someone who is doing nothing,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m doing something!\u201d I snapped, yanking my hand back. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d he began.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t!\u201d I slammed my fist on the gun, the noiseless blow seeming to symbolize the pain-filled futility of the day. \u201cDo you know how many men I lost today? Twenty-three! I\u2019ve been on my feet since dawn, elbow-deep in filth and vomit and my clothes stuck to me, and none of it\u2019s been any good! I couldn\u2019t help! Do you hear me? I couldn\u2019t help!\u201d</p><p>His face was turned away, in shadow, but his shoulders were stiff.</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou shame me, Madam. I had kept to my cabin at the Captain\u2019s orders, but I had no idea that the circumstances were such as you describe, or I assure you that I should have come to help, in spite of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I said blankly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it yours?\u201d He swung around to face me, and I saw that he was handsome, in his late thirties, perhaps, with sensitive, fine-cut features, and large blue eyes, open in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>He studied my face for a moment, and his own expression changed, fading from surprise to thoughtfulness.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I pressed my fingertips hard against my brow, in the spot Mr. Willoughby had shown me, to relieve headache. \u201cIf the Captain means you to keep to your cabin, then you likely should. There are enough hands to help in the sickbay; it\u2019s just that...nothing helps,\u201d I ended, dropping my hands.</p><p>He walked over to the rail, a few feet away from me, and stood looking out over the expanse of dark water, sparked here and there as a random wave caught the starlight.</p><p>\u201cI do see,\u201d he repeated, as though talking to the waves. \u201cI had thought your distress due only to a woman\u2019s natural compassion, but I see it is something quite different.\u201d He paused, hands gripping the rail, an indistinct figure in the starlight.</p><p>\u201cI have been a soldier, an officer,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what it is, to hold men\u2019s lives in your hand\u2014and to lose them.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet, and so was he. The usual shipboard sounds went on in the distance, muted by night and the lack of men to make them. At last he sighed and turned toward me again.</p><p>\u201cWhat it comes to, I think, is the knowledge that you are not God.\u201d He paused, then added, softly, \u201cAnd the very real regret that you cannot be.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, feeling some of the tension drain out of me. The cool wind lifted the weight of my hair from my neck, and the curling ends drifted across my face, gentle as a touch.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said.</p><p>He hesitated a moment, as though not knowing what to say next, then bent, picked up my hand, and kissed it, very simply, without affectation.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d he said, and turned away, the sound of his footsteps loud on the deck.</p><p>He was no more than a few yards past me when a seaman, hurrying by, spotted him and stopped with a cry. It was Jones, one of the stewards.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord! You shouldn\u2019t ought to be out of your cabin, sir! The night air\u2019s mortal, and the plague loose on board\u2014and the Captain\u2019s orders\u2014whatever is your servant a-thinking of, sir, to let you walk about like this?\u201d</p><p>My acquaintance nodded apologetically.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I know. I shouldn\u2019t have come up; but I thought that if I stayed in the cabin a moment longer I should be stifled altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter stifled than dead o\u2019 the bloody flux, sir, and you\u2019ll pardon of my saying so,\u201d Jones replied sternly. My acquaintance made no remonstrance to this, but merely murmured something and disappeared in the shadows of the afterdeck.</p><p>I reached out a hand and grasped Jones by the sleeve as he passed, causing him to start, with a wordless yelp of alarm.</p><p>\u201cOh! Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d he said, coming to earth, a bony hand splayed across his chest. \u201cChrist, I did think you was a ghost, mum, begging your pardon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg yours,\u201d I said, politely. \u201cI only wanted to ask\u2014who was the man you were just talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him?\u201d Jones twisted about to look over his shoulder, but the aptly named Mr. Grey had long since vanished. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s Lord John Grey, mum, him as is the new governor of Jamaica.\u201d He frowned censoriously in the direction taken by my acquaintance. \u201cHe ain\u2019t supposed to be up here; the Captain\u2019s give strict orders he\u2019s to stay safe below, out o\u2019 harm\u2019s way. All we need\u2019s to come into port with a dead political aboard, and there\u2019ll be the devil to pay, mum, savin\u2019 your presence.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head disapprovingly, then turned to me with a bob of the head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be retiring, mum? Shall I bring you down a nice cup of tea and maybe a bit o\u2019 biscuit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Jones,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll go and check the sickbay again before I go to bed. I don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do, mum, and you just say. Anytime. Good night to you, mum.\u201d He touched his forelock briefly and hurried off.</p><p>I stood at the rail alone for a moment before going below, drawing in deep breaths of the clean, fresh air. It would be a good many hours yet until dawn; the stars burned bright and clear over my head, and I realized, quite suddenly, that the moment of grace I had wordlessly prayed for had come, after all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said at last, aloud, to the sea and sky. \u201cA sunset wouldn\u2019t have been enough. Thank you,\u201d I added, and went below.</p><p>49</p><p>LAND HO!</p><p>It\u2019s true, what the sailors say. You can smell land, a long time before you see it.</p><p>Despite the long voyage, the goat pen in the hold was a surprisingly pleasant place. By now, the fresh straw had been exhausted, and the goats\u2019 hooves clicked restlessly to and fro on bare boards. Still, the heaps of manure were swept up daily, and neatly piled in baskets to be heaved overboard, and Annekje Johansen brought dry armloads of hay to the manger each morning. There was a strong smell of goat, but it was a clean, animal scent, and quite pleasant by contrast with the stench of unwashed sailors.</p><p>\u201cKomma, komma, komma, dyr get,\u201d she crooned, luring a yearling within reach with a twiddled handful of hay. The animal stretched out cautious lips, and was promptly seized by the neck and pulled forward, its head secured under Annekje\u2019s brawny arm.</p><p>\u201cTicks, is it?\u201d I asked, coming forward to help. Annekje looked up and gave me her broad, gap-toothed smile.</p><p>\u201cGuten Morgen, Mrs. Claire,\u201d she said. \u201cJa, tick. Here.\u201d She took the young goat\u2019s drooping ear in one hand and turned up the silky edge to show me the blueberry bulge of a blood-gorged tick, burrowed deep in the tender skin.</p><p>She clutched the goat to hold it still, and dug into the ear, pinching the tick viciously between her nails. She pulled it free with a twist, and the goat blatted and kicked, a tiny spot of blood welling from its ear where the tick had been detached.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, when she would have released the animal. She glanced at me, curious, but kept her hold and nodded. I took the bottle of alcohol I wore slung at my belt like a sidearm, and poured a few drops on the ear. It was soft and tender, the tiny veins clearly visible beneath the satin skin. The goat\u2019s square-pupilled eyes bulged farther and its tongue stuck out in agitation as it bleated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo sore ear,\u201d I said, in explanation, and Annekje nodded in approval.</p><p>Then the goatling was free, and went plunging back into the herd, to butt its head against its mother\u2019s side in a frantic search for milky reassurance. Annekje looked about for the discarded tick and found it lying on the deck, tiny legs helpless to move its swollen body. She smashed it casually under the heel of her shoe, leaving a tiny dark blotch on the board.</p><p>\u201cWe come to land?\u201d I asked, and she nodded, with a wide, happy smile. She waved expansively upward, where sunlight fell through the grating overhead.</p><p>\u201cJa. Smell?\u201d she said, sniffing vigorously in illustration. She beamed. \u201cLand, ja! Water, grass. Is goot, goot!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to go to land,\u201d I said, watching her carefully. \u201cGo quiet. Secret. Not tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Annekje\u2019s eyes widened, and she looked at me speculatively. \u201cNot tell Captain, ja?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tell anyone,\u201d I said, nodding hard. \u201cYou can help?\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment, thinking. A big, placid woman, she reminded me of her own goats, adapting cheerfully to the queer life of shipboard, enjoying the pleasures of hay and warm company, thriving despite the lurching deck and stuffy shadows of the hold.</p><p>With that same air of capable adaptation, she looked up at me and nodded calmly.</p> <p>\u201cJa, I help.\u201d</p><p>It was past midday when we anchored off what one of the midshipmen told me was Watlings Island.</p><p>I looked over the rail with considerable curiosity. This flat island, with its wide white beaches and lines of low palms, had once been called San Salvador. Renamed for the present in honor of a notorious buccaneer of the last century, this dot of land was presumably Christopher Columbus\u2019s first sight of the New World.</p><p>I had the substantial advantage over Columbus of having known for a fact that the land was here, but still I felt a faint echo of the joy and relief that the sailors of those tiny wooden caravels had felt at that first landfall.</p><p>Long enough on a rolling ship, and you forget what it is to walk on land. Getting sea legs, they call it. It\u2019s a metamorphosis, this leg-getting, like the change from tadpole to frog, a painless shift from one element to another. But the smell and sight of land makes you remember that you were born to the earth, and your feet ache suddenly for the touch of solid ground.</p><p>The problem at the moment was actually getting my feet on solid ground. Watlings Island was no more than a pause, to replenish our severely depleted water supply before the run through the Windward Isles down to Jamaica. It would be at least another week\u2019s sail, and the presence of so many invalids aboard requiring vast infusions of liquid had run the great water casks in the hold nearly dry.</p> <p>San Salvador was a small island, but I had learned from careful questioning of my patients that there was a fair amount of shipping traffic through its main port in Cockburn Town. It might not be the ideal place to escape, but it looked as though there would be little other choice; I had no intention of enjoying the navy\u2019s \u201chospitality\u201d on Jamaica, serving as the bait that would lure Jamie to arrest.</p><p>Starved as the crew was for the sight and feel of land, no one was allowed to go ashore save the watering party, now busy with their casks and sledges up Pigeon Creek, at whose foot we were anchored. One of the marines stood at the head of the gangway, blocking any attempt at leaving.</p><p>Such members of the crew as were not involved in watering or on watch stood by the rail, talking and joking or merely gazing at the island, the dream of hope fulfilled. Some way down the deck, I caught sight of a long, blond tail of hair, flying in the shore breeze. The Governor too had emerged from seclusion, pale face upturned to the tropic sun.</p><p>I would have gone to speak to him, but there was no time. Annekje had already gone below for the goat. I wiped my hands on my skirt, making my final estimations. It was no more than two hundred yards to the thick growth of palms and underbrush. If I could get down the gangway and into the jungle, I thought I had a good chance of getting away.</p><p>Anxious as he was to be on his way to Jamaica, Captain Leonard was unlikely to waste much time in trying to catch me. And if they did catch me\u2014well, the Captain could hardly punish me for trying to leave the ship; I was neither a seaman nor a formal captive, after all.</p><p>The sun shone on Annekje\u2019s blond head as she made her way carefully up the ladder, a young goat cozily nestled against her wide bosom. A quick glance, to see that I was in place, and she headed for the gangway.</p><p>Annekje spoke to the sentry in her queer mixture of English and Swedish, pointing to the goat and then ashore, insisting that it must have fresh grass. The marine appeared to understand her, but stood firm.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, respectfully enough, \u201cno one is to go ashore save the watering party; captain\u2019s orders.\u201d</p> <p>Standing just out of sight, I watched as she went on arguing, thrusting her goatling urgently in his face, forcing him a step back, a step to the side, maneuvering him artfully just far enough that I could slip past behind him. No more than a moment, now; he was almost in place. When she had drawn him away from the head of the gangplank, she would drop the goat and cause sufficient confusion in the catching of it that I would have a minute or two to make my escape.</p><p>I shifted nervously from foot to foot. My feet were bare; it would be easier to run on the sandy beach. The sentry moved, his red-coated back fully turned to me. A foot more, I thought, just a foot more.</p><p>\u201cSuch a fine day, is it not, Mrs. Malcolm?\u201d</p><p>I bit my tongue.</p><p>\u201cVery fine, Captain Leonard,\u201d I said, with some difficulty. My heart seemed to have stopped dead when he spoke. It now resumed beating much faster than usual, to make up for lost time.</p><p>The Captain stepped up beside me and looked over the rail, his young face shining with Columbus\u2019s joy. Despite my strong desire to push him overboard, I felt myself smile grudgingly at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cThis landfall is as much your victory as mine, Mrs. Malcolm,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout you, I doubt we should ever have brought the Porpoise to land.\u201d He very shyly touched my hand, and I smiled again, a little less grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would have managed, Captain,\u201d I said. \u201cYou seem to be a most competent sailor.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and blushed. He had shaved in honor of the land, and his smooth cheeks glowed pink and raw.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is mostly the hands, ma\u2019am; I may say they have done nobly. And their efforts, of course, are due in turn to your skill as a physician.\u201d He looked at me, brown eyes shining earnestly.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Mrs. Malcolm\u2014I cannot say what your skill and kindness have meant to us. I\u2014I mean to say so, too, to the Governor and to Sir Greville\u2014you know, the King\u2019s Commissioner on Antigua. I shall write a letter, a most sincere testimonial to you and to your efforts on our behalf. Perhaps\u2014perhaps it will help.\u201d He dropped his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHelp with what, Captain?\u201d My heart was still beating fast.</p><p>Captain Leonard bit his lip, then looked up.</p><p>\u201cI had not meant to say anything to you, ma\u2019am. But I\u2014really I cannot in honor keep silence. Mrs. Fraser, I know your name, and I know what your husband is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, trying to keep control of my own emotions. \u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><p>The boy looked surprised at that. \u201cWhy, ma\u2019am, he is a criminal.\u201d He paled a little. \u201cYou mean\u2014you did not know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew that,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cWhy are you telling me, though?\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, but met my eyes bravely enough. \u201cWhen I discovered your husband\u2019s identity, I wrote it in the ship\u2019s log. I regret that action now, but it is too late; the information is official. Once I reach Jamaica, I must report his name and destination to the authorities there, and likewise to the commander at the naval barracks on Antigua. He will be taken when the Artemis docks.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAnd if he is taken\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be hanged,\u201d I said, finishing what he could not. The boy nodded, wordless. His mouth opened and closed, seeking words.</p><p>\u201cI have seen men hanged,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMrs. Fraser, I just\u2014I\u2014\u201d He stopped then, fighting for control, and found it. He drew himself up straight and looked at me straight on, the joy of his landing drowned in sudden misery.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI cannot ask you to forgive me; I can only say that I am most terribly sorry.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and walked away. Directly before him stood Annekje Johansen and her goat, still in heated conversation with the sentry.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Captain Leonard demanded angrily. \u201cRemove this animal from the deck at once! Mr. Holford, what are you thinking of?\u201d</p><p>Annekje\u2019s eyes flicked from the captain to my face, instantly divining what had gone wrong. She stood still, head bowed to the captain\u2019s scolding, then marched away toward the hatchway to the goats\u2019 hold, clutching her yearling. As she passed, one big blue eye winked solemnly. We would try again. But how?</p><p>Racked by guilt and bedeviled by contrary winds, Captain Leonard avoided me, seeking refuge on his quarterdeck as we made our cautious way past Acklin Island and Samana Cay. The weather aided him in this evasion; it stayed bright, but with odd, light breezes alternating with sudden gusts, so that constant adjustment of the sails was required\u2014no easy task, in a ship so shorthanded.</p><p>It was four days later, as we shifted course to enter the Caicos Passage, that a sudden booming gust of wind struck the ship out of nowhere, catching her ill-rigged and unprepared.</p><p>I was on deck when the gust struck. There was a sudden whoosh that sent my skirts billowing and propelled me flying down the deck, followed by a sharp, loud crack! somewhere overhead. I crashed head-on into Ramsdell Hodges, one of the forecastle crew, and we whirled together in a mad pirouette before falling entangled to the deck.</p><p>There was confusion all around, with hands running and orders shouted. I sat up, trying to collect my scattered wits.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I demanded of Hodges, who staggered to his feet and reached down to lift me up. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe f**king mainmast\u2019s split,\u201d he said succinctly. \u201cSaving your presence, ma\u2019am, but it has. And now there\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>The Porpoise limped slowly south, not daring to risk the banks and shoals of the passage without a mainmast. Instead, Captain Leonard put in for repairs at the nearest convenient anchorage, Bottle Creek, on the shore of North Caicos Island.</p><p>This time, we were allowed ashore, but no great good did it do me. Tiny and dry, with few sources of fresh water, the Turks and Caicos provided little more than numerous tiny bays that might shelter passing ships caught in storms. And the idea of hiding on a foodless, waterless island, waiting for a convenient hurricane to blow me a ship, did not appeal.</p><p>To Annekje, though, our change of course suggested a new plan.</p><p>\u201cI know these island,\u201d she said, nodding wisely. \u201cWe go round now, Grand Turk, Mouchoir. Not Caicos.\u201d</p><p>I looked askance, and she squatted, drawing with a blunt forefinger in the yellow sand of the beach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee\u2014Caicos Passage,\u201d she said, sketching a pair of lines. At the top, between the lines, she sketched the small triangle of a sail. \u201cGo through,\u201d she said, indicating the Caicos Passage, \u201cbut mast is gone. Now\u2014\u201d She quickly drew several irregular circles, to the right of the passage. \u201cNorth Caicos, South Caicos, Caicos, Grand Turk,\u201d she said, stabbing a finger at each circle in turn. Go round now\u2014reefs. Mouchoir.\u201d And she drew another pair of lines, indicating a passage to the southeast of Grand Turk Island.</p><p>\u201cMouchoir Passage?\u201d I had heard the sailors mention it, but had no idea how it applied to my potential escape from the Porpoise.</p><p>Annekje nodded, beaming, then drew a long, wavy line, some way below her previous illustrations. She pointed at it proudly. \u201cHispaniola. St. Domingue. Big island, is there towns, lots ships.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrows, still baffled. She sighed, seeing that I didn\u2019t understand. She thought a moment, then stood up, dusting her heavy thighs. We had been gathering whelks from the rocks in a shallow pan. She seized this, dumped out the whelks, and filled it with seawater. Then, laying it on the sand, she motioned to me to watch.</p> <p>She stirred the water carefully, in a circular motion, then lifted her finger out, stained dark with the purple blood of the whelks. The water continued to move, swirling past the tin sides.</p><p>Annekje pulled a thread from the raveling hem of her skirt, bit off a short piece, and spat it into the water. It floated, following the swirl of the water in lazy circles round the pan.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, pointing at it. \u201cVater move you.\u201d She pointed back to her drawing in the sand. A new triangle, in the Mouchoir Passage. A line, curving from the tiny sail down to the left, indicating the ship\u2019s course. And now, the blue thread representing me, rescued from its immersion. She placed it by the tiny sail representing the Porpoise, then dragged it off, down the Passage toward the coast of Hispaniola.</p><p>\u201cJump,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d I said in horror.</p> <p>She chuckled in deep satisfaction at my understanding. \u201cJa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it vork. Vater move you.\u201d She pointed to the end of the Mouchoir Passage, to the coast of Hispaniola, and stirred the water in the pan once more. We stood side by side, watching the ripples of her manufactured current die away.</p><p>Annekje glanced thoughtfully sideways at me. \u201cYou try not drown, ja?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and brushed the hair out of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJa,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>50</p><p>I MEET A PRIEST</p> <p>The sea was remarkably warm, as seas go, and like a warm bath as compared to the icy surf off Scotland. On the other hand, it was extremely wet. After two or three hours of immersion, my feet were numb and my fingers chilled where they gripped the ropes of my makeshift life preserver, made of two empty casks.</p><p>The gunner\u2019s wife was as good as her word, though. The long, dim shape I had glimpsed from the Porpoise grew steadily nearer, its low hills dark as black velvet against a silver sky. Hispaniola\u2014Haiti.</p><p>I had no way of telling time, and yet two months on shipboard, with its constant bells and watch-changes, had given me a rough feeling for the passage of the night hours. I thought it must have been near midnight when I left the Porpoise; now it was likely near 4:00 A.M., and still over a mile to the shore. Ocean currents are strong, but they take their time.</p><p>Worn out from work and worry, I twisted the rope awkwardly about one wrist to prevent my slipping out of the harness, laid my forehead on one cask, and drifted off to sleep with the scent of rum strong in my nostrils.</p><p>The brush of something solid beneath my feet woke me to an opal dawn, the sea and sky both glowing with the colors found inside a shell. With my feet planted in cold sand, I could feel the strength of the current flowing past me, tugging on the casks. I disentangled myself from the rope harness and with considerable relief, let the unwieldy things go bobbing toward the shore.</p><p>There were deep red indentations on my shoulders. The wrist I had twisted through the wet rope was rubbed raw; I was chilled, exhausted, and very thirsty, and my legs were rubbery as boiled squid.</p><p>On the other hand, the sea behind me was empty, the Porpoise nowhere in sight. I had escaped.</p><p>Now, all that remained to be done was to get ashore, find water, find some means of quick transport to Jamaica, and find Jamie and the Artemis, preferably before the Royal Navy did. I thought I could just about manage the first item on the agenda.</p> <p>Such little as I knew of the Caribbean from postcards and tourist brochures had led me to think in terms of white-sand beaches and crystal lagoons. In fact, prevailing conditions ran more toward a lot of dense and ugly vegetation, embedded in extremely sticky dark-brown mud.</p><p>The thick bushlike plants must be mangroves. They stretched as far as I could see in either direction; there was no alternative but to clamber through them. Their roots rose out of the mud in big loops like croquet wickets, which I tripped over regularly, and the pale, smooth gray twigs grew in bunches like finger bones, snatching at my hair as I passed.</p><p>Squads of tiny purple crabs ran off in profound agitation at my approach. My feet sank into the mud to the ankles, and I thought better of putting on my shoes, wet as they were. I rolled them up in my wet skirt, kirtling it up above my knees and took out the fish knife Annekje had given me, just in case. I saw nothing threatening, but felt better with a weapon in my hand.</p><p>The rising sun on my shoulders at first was welcome, as it thawed my chilled flesh and dried my clothes. Within an hour, though, I wished that it would go behind a cloud. I was sweating heavily as the sun rose higher, caked to the knees with drying mud, and growing thirstier by the moment.</p><p>I tried to see how far the mangroves extended, but they rose above my head, and tossing waves of narrow, gray-green leaves were all I could see.</p><p>\u201cThe whole bloody island can\u2019t be mangroves,\u201d I muttered, slogging on. \u201cThere has to be solid land someplace.\u201d And water, I hoped.</p><p>A noise like a small cannon going off nearby startled me so that I dropped the fish knife. I groped frantically in the mud for it, then dived forward onto my face as something large whizzed past my head, missing me by inches.</p><p>There was a loud rattling of leaves, and then a sort of conversational-sounding \u201cKwark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I croaked. I sat up cautiously, knife in one hand, and wiped the wet, muddy curls out of my face with the other. Six feet away, a large black bird was sitting on a mangrove, regarding me with a critical eye.</p><p>He bent his head, delicately preening his sleek black feathers, as though to contrast his immaculate appearance with my own dishevelment.</p><p>\u201cWell, la-di-dah,\u201d I said sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019ve got wings, mate.\u201d</p><p>The bird stopped preening and eyed me censoriously. Then he lifted his beak into the air, puffed his chest, and as though to further establish his sartorial superiority, suddenly inflated a large pouch of brilliant red skin that ran from the base of his neck halfway down his body.</p><p>\u201cBwoom!\u201d he said, repeating the cannon-like noise that had startled me before. It startled me again, but not so much.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I said irritably. Paying no attention, the bird slowly flapped its wings, settled back on its branch, and boomed again.</p><p>There was a sudden harsh cry from above, and with a loud flapping of wings, two more large black birds plopped down, landing in a mangrove a few feet away. Encouraged by the audience, the first bird went on booming at regular intervals, the skin of his pouch flaming with excitement. Within moments, three more black shapes had appeared overhead.</p><p>I was reasonably sure they weren\u2019t vultures, but I still wasn\u2019t inclined to stay. I had miles to go before I slept\u2014or found Jamie. The chances of finding him in time were something I preferred not to dwell on.</p><p>A half-hour later, I had made so little progress that I could still hear the intermittent booming of my fastidious acquaintance, now joined by a number of similarly vocal friends. Panting with exertion, I picked a thickish root and sat down to rest.</p><p>My lips were cracked and dry, and the thought of water was occupying my mind to the exclusion of virtually everything else, even Jamie. I had been struggling through the mangroves for what seemed like forever, yet I could still hear the sound of the ocean. In fact, the tide must have been following me, for as I sat, a thin sheet of foaming, dirty seawater came purling through the mangrove roots to touch my toes briefly before receding.</p><p>\u201cWater, water everywhere,\u201d I said ruefully, watching it, \u201cnor any drop to drink.\u201d</p><p>A small movement on the damp mud caught my eye. Bending down, I saw several small fishes, of a sort I had never seen before. So far from flopping about, gasping for breath, these fish were sitting upright, propped on their pectoral fins, looking as though the fact that they were out of water was of no concern at all.</p><p>Fascinated, I bent closer to inspect them. One or two shifted on their fins, but they seemed not to mind being looked at. They goggled solemnly back at me, eyes bulging. It was only as I looked closer that I realized that the goggling appearance was caused by the fact that each fish appeared to have four eyes, not two.</p><p>I stared at one for a long minute, feeling the sweat trickle down between my br**sts.</p><p>\u201cEither I\u2019m hallucinating,\u201d I told it conversationally, \u201cor you are.\u201d</p><p>The fish didn\u2019t answer, but hopped suddenly, landing on a branch several inches above the ground. Perhaps it sensed something, for a moment later, another wave washed through, this one splashing up to my ankles.</p><p>A sudden welcome coolness fell on me. The sun had obligingly gone behind a cloud, and with its vanishing, the whole feel of the mangrove forest changed.</p><p>The gray leaves rattled as a sudden wind came up, and all the tiny crabs and fish and sand fleas disappeared as though by magic. They obviously knew something I didn\u2019t, and I found their going rather sinister.</p><p>I glanced up at the cloud where the sun had vanished, and gasped. A huge purple mass of boiling cloud was coming up behind the hills, so fast that I could actually see the leading edge of the mass, blazing white with shielded sunlight, moving forward toward me.</p><p>The next wave came through, two inches higher than the last, and taking longer to recede. I was neither a fish nor a crab, but by this time I had tumbled to the fact that a storm was on its way, and moving with amazing speed.</p><p>I glanced around, but saw nothing more than the seemingly infinite stretch of mangroves before me. Nothing that could be used for shelter. Still, being caught out in a rainstorm was hardly the worst that could happen, under the circumstances. My tongue felt dry and sticky, and I licked my lips at the thought of cool, sweet rain falling on my face.</p><p>The swish of another wave halfway up my shins brought me to a sudden awareness that I was in danger of more than getting wet. A quick glance into the upper branches of the mangroves showed me dried tufts of seaweed tangled in the twigs and crotches\u2014high-tide level\u2014and well above my head.</p><p>I felt a moment\u2019s panic, and tried to calm myself. If I lost my bearings in this place, I was done for. \u201cHold on, Beauchamp,\u201d I muttered to myself. I remembered a bit of advice I\u2019d learned as an intern\u2014\u201cThe first thing to do in a cardiac arrest is take your own pulse.\u201d I smiled at the memory, feeling panic ebb at once. As a gesture, I did take my pulse; a little fast, but strong and steady. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All right, then, which way? Toward the mountain; it was the only thing I could see above the sea of mangroves. I pushed my way through the branches as fast as I could, ignoring the ripping of my skirts and the increasing pull of each wave on my legs. The wind was coming from the sea behind me, pushing the waves higher. It blew my hair constantly into my eyes and mouth, and I wiped it back again and again, cursing out loud for the comfort of hearing a voice, but my throat was soon so dry that it hurt to talk.</p><p>I squelched on. My skirt kept pulling loose from my belt, and somewhere I dropped my shoes, which disappeared at once in the boiling foam that now washed well above my knees. It didn\u2019t seem to matter.</p><p>The tide was midthigh when the rain hit. With a roar that drowned the rattle of the leaves, it fell in drenching sheets that soaked me to the skin in moments. At first I wasted time vainly tilting my head back, trying to direct the rivulets that ran down my face into my open mouth. Then sense reasserted itself; I took off the kerchief tucked around my shoulders, let the rain soak it and wrung it out several times, to remove the vestiges of salt. Then I let it soak in the rain once more, lifted the wadded fabric to my mouth, and sucked the water from it. It tasted of sweat and seaweed and coarse cotton. It was delicious.</p><p>I had kept going, but was still in the clutches of the mangroves. The incoming tide was nearly waist-deep, and the walking getting much harder. Thirst slaked momentarily, I put my head down and pushed forward as fast as I could.</p> <p>Lightning flashed over the mountains, and a moment later came the growl of thunder. The wash of the tide was so strong now that I could move forward only as each wave came in, half-running as the water shoved me along, then clinging to the nearest mangrove stem as the wash sucked back, dragging my trailing legs.</p><p>I was beginning to think that I had been over-hasty in abandoning Captain Leonard and the Porpoise. The wind was rising still further, dashing rain into my face so that I could barely see. Sailors say every seventh wave is higher. I found myself counting, as I slogged forward. It was the ninth wave, in fact, that struck me between the shoulder blades and knocked me flat before I could grasp a branch.</p><p>I floundered, helpless and choking in a blur of sand and water, then found my feet and stood upright again. The wave had half-drowned me, but had also altered my direction. I was no longer facing the mountain. I was, however, facing a large tree, no more than twenty feet away.</p><p>Four more waves, four more surging rushes forward, four more grim clutchings as the tide-race sought to pull me back, and I was on the muddy bank of a small inlet, where a tiny stream ran through the mangroves and out to sea. I crawled up it, slipping and staggering as I clambered into the welcoming embrace of the tree.</p><p>From a perch twelve feet up, I could see the stretch of the mangrove swamp behind me, and beyond that, the open sea. I changed my mind once more about the wisdom of my leaving the Porpoise; no matter how awful things were on land, they were a good deal worse out there.</p> <p>Lightning shattered over a surface of boiling water, as wind and tide-race fought for control of the waves. Farther out, in the Mouchoir Passage, the swell was so high, it looked like rolling hills. The wind was high enough now to make a thin, whistling scream as it passed by, chilling me to the skin in my wet clothes. Thunder cracked together with the lightning flashes now, as the storm moved over me.</p><p>The Artemis was slower than the man-of-war; slow enough, I hoped, to be still safe, far out in the Atlantic.</p><p>I saw one clump of mangroves struck, a hundred feet away; the water hissed back, boiled away, and the dry land showed for a moment, before the waves rolled back, drowning the black wire of the blasted stems. I wrapped my arms about the trunk of the tree, pressed my face against the bark, and prayed. For Jamie, and the Artemis. For the Porpoise, Annekje Johansen and Tom Leonard and the Governor. And for me.</p><p>It was full daylight when I woke, my leg wedged between two branches, and numb from the knee down. I half-climbed, half-fell from my perch, landing in the shallow water of the inlet. I scooped up a handful of the water, tasted it, and spat it out. Not salt, but too brackish to drink.</p><p>My clothes were damp, but I was parched. The storm was long gone; everything around me was peaceful and normal, with the exception of the blackened mangroves. In the distance, I could hear the booming of the big black birds.</p><p>Brackish water here promised fresher water farther up the inlet. I rubbed my leg, trying to work out the pins-and-needles, then limped up the bank.</p> <p>The vegetation began to change from the gray-green mangroves to a lusher green, with a thick undergrowth of grass and mossy plants that obliged me to walk in the water. Tired and thirsty as I was, I could go only a short distance before having to sit down and rest. As I did so, several of the odd little fish hopped up onto the bank beside me, goggling as though in curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you look rather peculiar, too,\u201d I told one.</p><p>\u201cAre you English?\u201d said the fish incredulously. The impression of Alice in Wonderland was so pronounced that I merely blinked stupidly at it for a moment. Then my head snapped up, and I stared into the face of the man who had spoken.</p><p>His face was weathered and sunburned to the color of mahogany, but the black hair that curled back from his brow was thick and ungrizzled. He stepped out from behind the mangrove, moving cautiously, as though afraid to startle me.</p><p>He was a bit above middle height and burly, thick through the shoulder, with a broad, boldly carved face, whose naturally friendly expression was tinged with wariness. He was dressed shabbily, with a heavy canvas bag slung across his shoulder\u2014and a canteen made of goatskin hung from his belt.</p><p>\u201cVous \u00eates Anglaise?\u201d he asked, repeating his original question in French. \u201cComment \u00e7a va?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m English,\u201d I said, croaking. \u201cMay I have some water, please?\u201d</p><p>His eyes popped wide open\u2014they were a light hazel\u2014but he didn\u2019t say anything, just took the skin bag from his belt and handed it to me.</p> <p>I laid the fish knife on my knee, close within reach, and drank deeply, scarcely able to gulp fast enough.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to drink too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, slightly breathless as I lowered the bag. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor.\u201d I lifted the canteen and drank again, but forced myself to swallow more slowly this time.</p><p>My rescuer was regarding me quizzically\u2014and little wonder, I supposed. Sea-soaked and sun-dried, mud-caked and sweat-stained, with my hair straggling down over my face, I looked like a beggar, and probably a demented one at that.</p><p>\u201cA doctor?\u201d he said in English, showing that his thoughts had been traveling in the direction I suspected. He eyed me closely, in a way strongly reminiscent of the big black bird I had met earlier. \u201cA doctor of what, if I might ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedicine,\u201d I said, pausing briefly between gulps.</p><p>He had strongly drawn black brows. These rose nearly to his hairline.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he said, after a noticeable pause.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said in the same tone of voice, and he laughed.</p><p>He inclined his head toward me in a formal bow. \u201cIn that case, Madame Physician, allow me to introduce myself. Lawrence Stern, Doctor of Natural Philosophy, of the Gesellschaft von Naturwissenschaft Philosophieren, Munich.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cA naturalist,\u201d he elaborated, gesturing at the canvas bag over his shoulder. \u201cI was making my way toward those frigate birds in hopes of observing their breeding display, when I happened to overhear you, er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to a fish,\u201d I finished. \u201cYes, well...have they really got four eyes?\u201d I asked, in hopes of changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014or so it seems.\u201d He glanced down at the fish, who appeared to be following the conversation with rapt attention. \u201cThey seem to employ their oddly shaped optics when submerged, so that the upper pair of eyes observes events above the surface of the water, and the lower pair similarly takes note of happenings below it.\u201d</p><p>He looked then at me, with a hint of a smile. \u201cMight I perhaps have the honor of knowing your name, Madame Physician?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, unsure what to tell him. I pondered the assortment of available aliases and decided on the truth.</p><p>\u201cFraser,\u201d I said. \u201cClaire Fraser. Mrs. James Fraser,\u201d I added for good measure, feeling vaguely that marital status might make me seem slightly more respectable, appearances notwithstanding. I fingered back the curl hanging in my left eye.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Madame,\u201d he said with a gracious bow. He rubbed the bridge of his nose thoughtfully, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYou have been shipwrecked, perhaps?\u201d he ventured. It seemed the most logical\u2014if not the only\u2014explanation of my presence, and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI need to find a way to get to Jamaica,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think you can help me?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, frowning slightly, as though I were a specimen he couldn\u2019t quite decide how to classify, but then he nodded. He had a broad mouth that looked made for smiling; one corner turned up, and he extended a hand to help me up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI can help. But I think maybe first we find you some food, and maybe clothes, eh? I have a friend, who lives not so far away. I will take you there, shall I?\u201d</p><p>What with parching thirst and the general press of events, I had paid little attention to the demands of my stomach. At the mention of food, however, II\u2019 it came immediately and vociferously to life.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said loudly, in hopes of drowning it out, \u201cwould be very nice indeed.\u201d I brushed back the tangle of my hair as well as I could, and ducking under a branch, followed my rescuer into the trees.</p><p>As we emerged from a palmetto grove, the ground opened out into a meadow-like space, then rose up in a broad hill before us. At the top of the hill, I could see a house\u2014or at least a ruin. Its yellow plaster walls were cracked and overrun by pink bougainvillaeas and straggling guavas, the tin roof sported several visible holes, and the whole place gave off an air of mournful dilapidation.</p><p>\u201cHacienda de la Fuente,\u201d my new acquaintance said, with a nod toward it. \u201cCan you stand the walk up the hill, or\u2014\u201d He hesitated, eyeing me as though estimating my weight. \u201cI could carry you, I suppose,\u201d he said, with a not altogether flattering tone of doubt in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d I assured him. My feet were bruised and sore, and punctured by fallen palmetto fronds, but the path before us looked relatively smooth.</p><p>The hillside leading up to the house was crisscrossed with the faint lines of sheep trails. There were a number of these animals present, peacefully grazing under the hot Hispaniola sun. As we stepped out of the trees, one sheep spotted us and uttered a short bleat of surprise. Like clockwork, every sheep on the hillside lifted its head in unison and stared at us.</p><p>Feeling rather self-conscious under this unblinking phalanx of suspicious eyes, I picked up my muddy skirts and followed Dr. Stern toward the main path\u2014trodden by more than sheep, to judge from its width\u2014that led up and over the hill.</p><p>It was a fine, bright day, and flocks of orange and white butterflies flickered through the grass. They lighted on the scattered blooms with here and there a brilliant yellow butterfly shining like a tiny sun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I breathed in deeply, a lovely smell of grass and flowers, with minor notes of sheep and sun-warmed dust. A brown speck lighted for a moment on my sleeve and clung, long enough for me to see the velvet scales on its wing, and the tiny curled hose of its proboscis. The slender abdomen pulsed, breathing to its wing-beats, and then it was gone.</p><p>It might have been the promise of help, the water, the butterflies, or all three, but the burden of fear and fatigue under which I had labored for so long began to lift. True, I still had to face the problem of finding transport to Jamaica, but with thirst assuaged, a friend at hand, and the possibility of lunch just ahead, that no longer appeared the impossible task it had seemed in the mangroves.</p><p>\u201cThere he is!\u201d Lawrence stopped, waiting for me to come up alongside him on the path. He gestured upward, toward a slight, wiry figure, picking its way carefully down the hillside toward us. I squinted at the figure as it wandered through the sheep, who took no apparent notice of his passage.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s St. Francis of Assisi.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence glanced at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, neither one. I told you he\u2019s English.\u201d He raised an arm and shouted, \u201c\u00c1Hola! Se\u00f1or Fogden!\u201d</p><p>The gray-robed figure paused suspiciously, one hand twined protectively in the wool of a passing ewe.</p><p>\u201c\u00c0Quien es?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStern!\u201d called Lawrence. \u201cLawrence Stern! Come along,\u201d he said, and extended a hand to pull me up the steep hillside onto the sheep path above.</p> <p>The ewe was making determined efforts to escape her protector, which distracted him from our approach. A slender man a bit taller than I, he had a lean face that might have been handsome if not disfigured by a reddish beard that straggled dust-mop-like round the edges of his chin. His long and straying hair had gone to gray in streaks and runnels, and fell forward into his eyes with some frequency. An orange butterfly took wing from his head as we reached him.</p><p>\u201cStern?\u201d he said, brushing back the hair with his free hand and blinking owlishly in the sunlight. \u201cI don\u2019t know any...oh, it\u2019s you!\u201d His thin face brightened. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say it was the shitworm man; I should have known you at once!\u201d</p><p>Stern looked mildly embarrassed at this, and glanced at me apologetically. \u201cI...ah...collected several interesting parasites from the excrement of Mr. Fogden\u2019s sheep, upon the occasion of my last visit,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cHorrible great worms!\u201d Father Fogden said, shuddering violently in recollection. \u201cA foot long, some of them, at least!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than eight inches,\u201d Stern corrected, smiling. He glanced at the nearest sheep, his hand resting on his collecting bag as though in anticipation of further imminent contributions to science. \u201cWas the remedy I suggested effective?\u201d</p><p>Father Fogden looked vaguely doubtful, as though trying to remember quite what the remedy had been.</p> <p>\u201cThe turpentine drench,\u201d the naturalist prompted.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d The sun broke out on the priest\u2019s lean countenance, and he beamed fondly upon us. \u201cOf course, of course! Yes, it worked splendidly. A few of them died, but the rest were quite cured. Capital, entirely capital!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it seemed to dawn on Father Fogden that he was being less than hospitable.</p><p>\u201cBut you must come in!\u201d he said. \u201cI was just about to partake of the midday meal; I insist you must join me.\u201d The priest turned to me. \u201cThis will be Mrs. Stern, will it?\u201d</p><p>Mention of eight-inch intestinal worms had momentarily suppressed my hunger pangs, but at the mention of food, they came gurgling back in full force.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we should be delighted to partake of your hospitality,\u201d Stern answered politely. \u201cPray allow me to introduce my companion\u2014a Mrs. Fraser, a countrywoman of yours.\u201d</p><p>Fogden\u2019s eyes grew quite round at this. A pale blue, with a tendency to water in bright sun, they fixed wonderingly upon me.</p><p>\u201cAn Englishwoman?\u201d he said, disbelieving. \u201cHere?\u201d The round eyes took in the mud and salt stains on my crumpled dress, and my general air of disarray. He blinked for a moment, then stepped forward, and with the utmost dignity, bowed low over my hand.</p> <p>\u201cYour most obedient servant, Madame,\u201d he said. He rose and gestured grandly at the ruin on the hill. \u201cMi casa es su casa.\u201d He whistled sharply, and a small King Charles cavalier spaniel poked its face inquiringly out of the weeds.</p><p>\u201cWe have a guest, Ludo,\u201d the priest said, beaming. \u201cIsn\u2019t that nice?\u201d Tucking my hand firmly under one elbow, he took the sheep by its topknot of wool and towed us both toward the Hacienda de la Fuente, leaving Stern to follow.</p><p>The reason for the name became clear as we entered the dilapidated courtyard; a tiny cloud of dragonflies hovered like blinking lights over an algae-filled pool in one corner; it looked like a natural spring that someone had curbed in when the house was built. At least a dozen jungle fowl sprang up from the shattered pavement and flapped madly past our feet, leaving a small cloud of dust and feathers behind them. From other evidences left behind, I deduced that the trees overhanging the patio were their customary roost, and had been for some time.</p><p>\u201cAnd so I was fortunate enough to encounter Mrs. Fraser among the mangroves this morning,\u201d Stern concluded. \u201cI thought that perhaps you might...oh, look at that beauty! A magnificent Odonata!\u201d</p><p>A tone of amazed delight accompanied this last statement, and he pushed unceremoniously past us to peer up into the shadows of the palm-thatched patio roof, where an enormous dragonfly, at least four inches across, was darting to and fro, blue body catching fire when it crossed one of the errant rays of sunshine poking through the tattered roof.</p><p>\u201cOh, do you want it? Be my guest.\u201d Our host waved a gracious hand at the dragonfly. \u201cHere, Becky, trot in there and I\u2019ll see to your hoof in a bit.\u201d He shooed the ewe into the patio with a slap on the rump. It snorted and galloped off a few feet, then fell at once to browsing on the scattered fruit of a huge guava that overhung the ancient wall.</p><p>In fact, the trees around the patio had grown up to such an extent that the branches at many points interlaced. The whole of the courtyard seemed roofed with them, a sort of leafy tunnel, leading down the length of the patio into the gaping cavern of the house\u2019s entrance.</p><p>Drifts of dust and the pink paper leaves of bougainvillaea lay heaped against the sill, but just beyond, the dark wood floor gleamed with polish, bare and immaculate. It was dark inside, after the brilliance of the sunlight, but my eyes quickly adapted to the surroundings, and I looked around curiously.</p><p>It was a very plain room, dark and cool, furnished with no more than a long table, a few stools and chairs, and a small sideboard, over which hung a hideous painting in the Spanish style\u2014an emaciated Christ, goateed and pallid in the gloom, indicating with one skeletal hand the bleeding heart that throbbed in his chest.</p><p>This ghastly object so struck my eye that it was a moment before I realized there was someone else in the room. The shadows in one corner of the room coalesced, and a small round face emerged, wearing an expression of remarkable malignity. I blinked and took a step back. The woman\u2014for so she was\u2014took a step forward, black eyes fixed on me, unblinking as the sheep.</p><p>She was no more than four feet tall, and so thick through the body as to seem like a solid block, without joint or indentation. Her head was a small round knob atop her body, with the smaller knob of a sparse gray bun scraped tightly back behind it. She was a light mahogany color\u2014whether from the sun or naturally, I couldn\u2019t tell\u2014and looked like nothing so much as a carved wooden doll. An ill-wish doll.</p><p>\u201cMamacita,\u201d said the priest, speaking Spanish to the graven image, \u201cwhat good fortune! We have guests who will eat with us. You remember Se\u00f1or Stern?\u201d he added, gesturing at Lawrence.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, claro,\u201d said the image, through invisible wooden lips. \u201cThe Christ-killer. And who is the puta alba?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Se\u00f1ora Fraser,\u201d Father Fogden went on, beaming as though she had not spoken. \u201cThe poor lady has had the misfortune to be shipwrecked; we must assist her as much as we can.\u201d</p><p>Mamacita looked me over slowly from top to toe. She said nothing, but the wide nostrils flared with infinite contempt.</p><p>\u201cYour food\u2019s ready,\u201d she said, and turned away.</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d the priest said happily. \u201cMamacita welcomes you; she\u2019ll bring us some food. Won\u2019t you sit down?\u201d</p><p>The table was already laid with a large cracked plate and a wooden spoon. The priest took two more plates and spoons from the sideboard, and distributed them haphazardly about the table, gesturing hospitably at us to be seated.</p><p>A large brown coconut sat on the chair at the head of the table. Fogden tenderly picked this up and set it alongside his plate. The fibrous husk was darkened with age, and the hair was worn off it in patches, showing an almost polished appearance; I thought he must have had it for some time.</p><p>\u201cHallo there,\u201d he said, patting it affectionately. \u201cAnd how are you keeping this fine day, Coco?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Stern, but he was studying the portrait of Christ, a small frown between his thick black brows. I supposed it was up to me to open a conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou live alone here, Mr.\u2014ah, Father Fogden?\u201d I inquired of our host. \u201cYou, and\u2014er, Mamacita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so pleased to see you. I haven\u2019t any real company but Ludo and Coco, you know,\u201d he explained, patting the hairy nut once more.</p><p>\u201cCoco?\u201d I said politely, thinking that on the evidence to hand so far, Coco wasn\u2019t the only nut among those present. I darted another glance at Stern, who looked mildly amused, but not alarmed.</p><p>\u201cSpanish for bugbear\u2014coco,\u201d the priest explained. \u201cA hobgoblin. See him there, wee button nose and his dark little eyes?\u201d Fogden jabbed two long, slender fingers suddenly into the depressions in the end of the coconut and jerked them back, chortling.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah!\u201d he cried. \u201cMustn\u2019t stare, Coco, it\u2019s rude, you know!\u201d</p><p>The pale blue eyes darted a piercing glance at me, and with some difficulty, I removed my teeth from my lower lip.</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty lady,\u201d he said, as though to himself. \u201cNot like my Ermenegilda, but very pretty nonetheless\u2014isn\u2019t she, Ludo?\u201d</p><p>The dog, thus addressed, ignored me, but bounded joyfully at its master, shoving its head under his hand and barking. He scratched its ears affectionately, then turned his attention back to me.</p><p>\u201cWould one of Ermenegilda\u2019s dresses fit you, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know whether to answer this or not. Instead, I merely smiled politely, and hoped what I was thinking didn\u2019t show on my face. Fortunately, at this point Mamacita came back, carrying a steaming clay pot wrapped in towels. She slapped a ladleful of the contents on each plate, then went out, her feet\u2014if she had any\u2014moving invisibly beneath the shapeless skirt.</p><p>I stirred the mess on my plate, which appeared to be vegetable in nature. I took a cautious bite, and found it surprisingly good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFried plantain, mixed with manioc and red beans,\u201d Lawrence explained, seeing my hesitation. He took a large spoonful of the steaming pulp himself and ate it without pausing for it to cool.</p><p>I had expected something of an inquisition about my presence, identity, and prospects. Instead, Father Fogden was singing softly under his breath, keeping time on the table with his spoon between bites.</p><p>I darted a glance at Lawrence, eyebrows up. He merely smiled, raised one shoulder in a slight shrug, and bent to his own food.</p><p>No real conversation occurred until the conclusion of the meal, when Mamacita\u2014\u201cunsmiling\u201d seemed an understatement of her expression\u2014removed the plates, replacing them with a platter of fruit, three cups, and a gigantic clay pitcher.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever drunk sangria, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say \u201cYes,\u201d thought better of it, and said, \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d Sangria had been a popular drink in the 1960s, and I had had it many times at faculty parties and hospital social events. But for now, I was sure that it was unknown in England and Scotland; Mrs. Fraser of Edinburgh would never have heard of sangria.</p><p>\u201cA mixture of red wine and the juices of orange and lemon,\u201d Lawrence Stern was explaining. \u201cMulled with spices, and served hot or cold, depending upon the weather. A most comforting and healthful beverage, is it not, Fogden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Oh, yes. Most comforting.\u201d Not waiting for me to find out for myself, the priest drained his cup, and reached for the pitcher before I had taken the first sip.</p><p>It was the same; the same sweet, throat-rasping taste, and I suffered the momentary illusion that I was back at the party where I had first tasted it, in company with a marijuana-smoking graduate student and a professor of botany.</p> <p>This illusion was fostered by Stern\u2019s conversation, which dealt with his collections, and by Father Fogden\u2019s behavior. After several cups of sangria, he had risen, rummaged through the sideboard, and emerged with a large clay pipe. This he packed full of a strong-smelling herb shaken out of a paper twist, and proceeded to smoke.</p><p>\u201cHemp?\u201d Stern asked, seeing this. \u201cTell me, do you find it settling to the digestive processes? I have heard it is so, but the herb is unobtainable in most European cities, and I have no firsthand observations of its effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is most genial and comforting to the stomach,\u201d Father Fogden assured him. He drew in a huge breath, held it, then exhaled long and dreamily, blowing a stream of soft white smoke that floated in streamers of haze near the room\u2019s low ceiling. \u201cI shall send a packet home with you, dear fellow. Do say, now, what do you mean doing, you and this shipwrecked lady you have rescued?\u201d</p><p>Stern explained his plan; after a night\u2019s rest, we intended to walk as far as the village of St. Luis du Nord, and from there see whether a fishing boat might carry us to Cap-Ha\u00eftien, thirty miles distant. If not, we would have to make our way overland to Le Cap, the nearest port of any size.</p><p>The priest\u2019s sketchy brows drew close together, frowning against the smoke.</p><p>\u201cMm? Well, I suppose there isn\u2019t much choice, is there? Still, you must go careful, particularly if you go overland to Le Cap. Maroons, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaroons?\u201d I glanced quizzically at Stern, who nodded, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I did meet with two or three small bands as I came north through the valley of the Artibonite. They didn\u2019t molest me, though\u2014I daresay I looked little better off than they, poor wretches. The Maroons are escaped slaves,\u201d he explained to me. \u201cHaving fled the cruelty of their masters, they take refuge in the remote hills, where the jungle hides them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might not trouble you,\u201d Father Fogden said. He sucked deeply on his pipe, with a low, slurping noise, held his breath for a long count and then let it out reluctantly. His eyes were becoming markedly bloodshot. He closed one of them and examined me rather blearily with the other. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look worth robbing, really.\u201d</p><p>Stern smiled broadly, looking at me, then quickly erased the smile, as though feeling he had been less than tactful. He coughed and took another cup of sangria. The priest\u2019s eyes gleamed over the pipe, red as a ferret\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI believe I need a little fresh air,\u201d I said, pushing back my chair. \u201cAnd perhaps a little water, to wash with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course, of course!\u201d Father Fogden cried. He rose, swaying unsteadily, and thumped the coals from his pipe carelessly out onto the sideboard. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>The air in the patio seemed fresh and invigorating by comparison, despite its mugginess. I inhaled deeply, looking on with interest as Father Fogden fumbled with a bucket by the fountain in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhere does the water come from?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs it a spring?\u201d The stone trough was lined with soft tendrils of green algae, and I could see these moving lazily; evidently there was a current of some kind.</p> <p>It was Stern who answered.</p><p>\u201cYes, there are hundreds of such springs. Some of them are said to have spirits living in them\u2014but I do not suppose you subscribe to such superstition, sir?\u201d</p><p>Father Fogden seemed to have to think about this. He set the half-filled bucket down on the coping and squinted into the water, trying to fix his gaze on one of the small silver fish that swam there.</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cWell, no. Spirits, no. Still\u2014oh, yes, I had forgotten. I had something to show you.\u201d Going to a cupboard set into the wall, he pulled open the cracked wooden door and removed a small bundle of coarse unbleached muslin, which he put gingerly into Stern\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cIt came up in the spring one day last month,\u201d he said. \u201cIt died when the noon sun struck it, and I took it out. I\u2019m afraid the other fish nibbled it a bit,\u201d he said apologetically, \u201cbut you can still see.\u201d</p><p>Lying in the center of the cloth was a small dried fish, much like those darting about in the spring, save that this one was pure white. It was also blind. On either side of the blunt head, there was a small swelling where an eye should have been, but that was all.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it is a ghost fish?\u201d the priest inquired. \u201cI thought of it when you mentioned spirits. Still, I can\u2019t think what sort of sin a fish might have committed, so as to be doomed to roam about like that\u2014eyeless, I mean. I mean\u201d\u2014he closed one eye again in his favorite expression\u2014\u201cone doesn\u2019t think of fish as having souls, and yet, if they don\u2019t, how can they become ghosts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think they do, myself,\u201d I assured him. I peered more closely at the fish, which Stern was examining with the rapt joy of the born naturalist. The skin was very thin, and so transparent that the shadows of the internal organs and the knobbly line of the vertebrae were clearly visible, yet it did have scales, tiny and translucent, though dulled by dryness.</p><p>\u201cIt is a blind cave fish,\u201d Stern said, reverently stroking the tiny blunt head. \u201cI have seen one only once before, in a pool deep inside a cave, at a place called Abandawe. And that one escaped before I could examine it closely. My dear fellow\u2014\u201d He turned to the priest, eyes shining with excitement. \u201cMight I have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d The priest fluttered his fingers in offhand generosity. \u201cNo use to me. Too small to eat, you know, even if Mamacita would think of cooking it, which she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He glanced around the patio, kicking absently at a passing hen. \u201cWhere is Mamacita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, cabr\u00f3n, where else?\u201d I hadn\u2019t seen her come out of the house, but there she was, a dusty, sunbrowned little figure stooping to fill another bucket from the spring.</p><p>A faintly musty, unpleasant smell reached my nostrils, and they twitched uneasily. The priest must have noticed, for he said, \u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t mind, it\u2019s only poor Arabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArabella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in here.\u201d The priest held aside a ragged curtain of burlap that screened off a corner of the patio, and I glanced behind it.</p><p>A ledge jutted out of the stone wall at waist-height. On it were ranged a long row of sheep\u2019s skulls, pure white and polished.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to part with them, you see.\u201d Father Fogden gently stroked the heavy curve of a skull. \u201cThis was Beatriz\u2014so sweet and gentle. She died in lambing, poor thing.\u201d He indicated two much smaller skulls nearby, shaped and polished like the rest.</p><p>\u201cArabella is a\u2014a sheep, too?\u201d I asked. The smell was much stronger here, and I thought I really didn\u2019t want to know where it was coming from at all.</p><p>\u201cA member of my flock, yes, certainly.\u201d The priest turned his oddly bright blue eyes on me, looking quite fierce. \u201cShe was murdered! Poor Arabella, such a gentle, trusting soul. How they can have had the wickedness to betray such innocence for the sake of carnal lusts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said, rather inadequately. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry to hear that. Ah\u2014who murdered her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sailors, the wicked heathen! Killed her on the beach and roasted her poor body over a gridiron, just like St. Lawrence the Martyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens,\u201d I said.</p><p>The priest sighed, and his spindly beard appeared to droop with mourning.</p><p>\u201cYes, I must not forget the hope of Heaven. For if Our Lord observes the fall of every sparrow, He can scarcely have failed to observe Arabella. She must have weighed near on ninety pounds, at least, such a good grazer as she was, poor child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said, trying to infuse the remark with a suitable sympathy and horror. It then occurred to me what the priest had said.</p><p>\u201cSailors?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhen did you say this\u2014this sad occurrence took place?\u201d It couldn\u2019t be the Porpoise, I thought. Surely, Captain Leonard would not have thought me so important that he had risked bringing his ship in so close to the island, in order to pursue me? But my hands grew damp at the thought, and I wiped them unobtrusively on my robe.</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d Father Fogden replied, setting back the lamb\u2019s skull he had picked up to fondle. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, his manner brightening a bit, \u201cI must say they\u2019re making wonderful progress with her. It usually takes more than a week, and already you can quite see...\u201d</p><p>He opened the cupboard again, revealing a large lump, covered with several layers of damp burlap. The smell was markedly stronger now, and a number of small brown beetles scuttled away from the light.</p><p>\u201cAre those members of the Dermestidae you have there, Fogden?\u201d Lawrence Stern, having tenderly committed the corpse of his cave fish to a jar of alcoholic spirits, had come to join us. He peered over my shoulder, sunburned features creased in interest.</p><p>Inside the cupboard, the white maggot larvae of dermestid beetles were hard at work, polishing the skull of Arabella the sheep. They had made a good start on the eyes. The manioc shifted heavily in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cIs that what they are? I suppose so; dear voracious little fellows.\u201d The priest swayed alarmingly, catching himself on the edge of the cupboard. As he did so, he finally noticed the old woman, standing glaring at him, a bucket in either hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I had quite forgotten! You will be needing a change of clothing, will you not, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at myself. The dress and shift I was wearing were ripped in so many places that they were barely decent, and so soaked and sodden with water and swamp-mud that I was scarcely tolerable, even in such undemanding company as that of Father Fogden and Lawrence Stern.</p><p>Father Fogden turned to the graven image. \u201cHave we not something this unfortunate lady might wear, Mamacita?\u201d he asked in Spanish. He seemed to hesitate, swaying gently. \u201cPerhaps, one of the dresses in\u2014\u201d</p><p>The woman bared her teeth at me. \u201cThey are much too small for such a cow,\u201d she said, also in Spanish. \u201cGive her your old robe, if you must.\u201d She cast an eye of scorn on my tangled hair and mud-streaked face. \u201cCome,\u201d she said in English, turning her back on me. \u201cYou wash.\u201d</p> <p>She led me to a smaller patio at the back of the house, where she provided me with two buckets of cold, fresh water, a worn linen towel, and a small pot of soft soap, smelling strongly of lye. Adding a shabby gray robe with a rope belt, she bared her teeth at me again and left, remarking genially in Spanish, \u201cWash away the blood on your hands, Christ-killing whore.\u201d</p><p>I shut the patio gate after her with a considerable feeling of relief, stripped off my sticky, filthy clothes with even more relief, and made my toilet as well as might be managed with cold water and no comb.</p><p>Clad decently, if oddly, in Father Fogden\u2019s extra robe, I combed out my wet hair with my fingers, contemplating my peculiar host. I wasn\u2019t sure whether the priest\u2019s excursions into oddness were some form of dementia, or only the side effects of long-term alcoholism and cannabis intoxication, but he seemed a gentle, kindly soul, in spite of it. His servant\u2014if that\u2019s what she was\u2014was another question altogether.</p><p>Mamacita made me more than slightly nervous. Mr. Stern had announced his intention of going down to the seaside to bathe, and I was reluctant to go back into the house until he returned. There had been quite a lot of sangria left, and I suspected that Father Fogden\u2014if he was still conscious\u2014would be little protection by this time against that basilisk glare.</p><p>Still, I couldn\u2019t stay outside all afternoon; I was very tired, and wanted to sit down at least, though I would have preferred to find a bed and sleep for a week. There was a door opening into the house from my small patio; I pushed it open and stepped into the dark interior.</p> <p>I was in a small bedroom. I looked around, amazed; it didn\u2019t seem part of the same house as the Spartan main room and the shabby patios. The bed was made up with feather pillows and a coverlet of soft red wool. Four huge patterned fans were spread like bright wings across the whitewashed walls, and wax candles in a branched brass candelabrum sat on the table.</p><p>The furniture was simply but carefully made, and polished with oil to a soft, deep gloss. A curtain of striped cotton hung across the end of the room. It was pushed partway back, and I could see a row of dresses hung on hooks behind it, in a rainbow of silken color.</p><p>These must be Ermenegilda\u2019s dresses, the ones that Father Fogden had mentioned. I walked forward to look at them, my bare feet quiet on the floor. The room was dustless and clean, but very quiet, without the scent or vibration of human occupancy. No one lived in this room anymore.</p><p>The dresses were beautiful; all of silk and velvet, moir\u00e9 and satin, mousse-line and panne. Even hanging lifeless here from their hooks, they had the sheen and beauty of an animal\u2019s pelt, where some essence of life lingers in the fur.</p><p>I touched one bodice, purple velvet, heavy with embroidered silver pansies, centered with pearls. She had been small, this Ermenegilda, and slightly built\u2014several of the dresses had ruffles and pads cleverly sewn inside the bodices, to add to the illusion of a bust. The room was comfortable, though not luxurious; the dresses were splendid\u2014things that might have been worn at Court in Madrid.</p><p>Ermenegilda was gone, but the room still seemed inhabited. I touched a sleeve of peacock blue in farewell and tiptoed away, leaving the dresses to their dreams.</p> <p>I found Lawrence Stern on the veranda at the back of the house, overlooking a precipitous slope of aloe and guava. In the distance, a small humped island sat cradled in a sea of glimmering turquoise. He rose in courtesy, giving me a small bow and a look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser! You are in greatly improved looks, I must say. The Father\u2019s robe suits you somewhat more than it does him.\u201d He smiled at me, hazel eyes creasing in a flattering expression of admiration.</p><p>\u201cI expect the absence of dirt has more to do with it,\u201d I said, sitting down in the chair he offered me. \u201cIs that something to drink?\u201d There was a pitcher on the rickety wooden table between the chairs; moisture had condensed in a heavy dew on the sides and droplets ran enticingly down the sides. I had been thirsty so long that the sight of anything liquid automatically made my cheeks draw in with longing.</p><p>\u201cMore sangria,\u201d Stern said. He poured out a small cupful for each of us, and sipped his own, sighing with enjoyment. \u201cI hope you will not think me intemperate, Mrs. Fraser, but after months of tramping country, drinking nothing but water and the slaves\u2019 crude rum\u2014\u201d He closed his eyes in bliss. \u201cAmbrosia.\u201d</p><p>I was rather disposed to agree.</p><p>\u201cEr...is Father Fogden...?\u201d I hesitated, looking for some tactful way of inquiring after our host\u2019s state. I needn\u2019t have bothered.</p><p>\u201cDrunk,\u201d Stern said frankly. \u201cLimp as a worm, laid out on the table in the sala. He nearly always is, by the time the sun\u2019s gone down,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I settled back in the chair, sipping my own sangria. \u201cHave you known Father Fogden long?\u201d</p> <p>Stern rubbed a hand over his forehead, thinking. \u201cOh, for a few years.\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cI was wondering\u2014do you by chance know a James Fraser, from Edinburgh? I realize it is a common name, but\u2014oh, you do?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t spoken, but my face had given me away, as it always did, unless I was carefully prepared to lie.</p><p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s name is James Fraser,\u201d I said.</p><p>Stern\u2019s face lighted with interest. \u201cIndeed!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cAnd is he a very large fellow, with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed hair,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s Jamie.\u201d Something occurred to me. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d met a natural philosopher in Edinburgh, and had a most interesting conversation about...various things.\u201d What I was wondering was where Stern had learned Jamie\u2019s real name. Most people in Edinburgh would have known him only as \u201cJamie Roy,\u201d the smuggler, or as Alexander Malcolm, the respectable printer of Carfax Close. Surely Dr. Stern, with his distinct German accent, couldn\u2019t be the \u201cEnglishman\u201d Tompkins had spoken of?</p><p>\u201cSpiders,\u201d Stern said promptly. \u201cYes, I recall perfectly. Spiders and caves. We met in a\u2014a\u2014\u201d His face went blank for a moment. Then he coughed, masterfully covering the lapse. \u201cIn a, um, drinking establishment. One of the\u2014ah\u2014 female employees happened to encounter a large specimen of Arachmida hanging from the ceiling in her\u2014that is, from the ceiling as she was engaged in...ah, conversation with me. Being somewhat frightened in consequence, she burst into the passageway, shrieking incoherently.\u201d Stern took a large gulp of sangria as a restorative, evidently finding the memory stressful.</p><p>\u201cI had just succeeded in capturing the animal and securing it in a specimen jar when Mr. Fraser burst into the room, pointed a species of firearm at me, and said\u2014\u201d Here Stern developed a prolonged coughing fit, pounding himself vigorously on the chest.</p><p>\u201cEheu! Do you not find this particular pitcher perhaps a trifle strong, Mrs. Fraser? I suspect that the old woman has added too many sliced lemons.\u201d</p><p>I suspected that Mamacita would have added cyanide, had she any to hand, but in fact the sangria was excellent.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d I said, sipping. \u201cBut do go on. Jamie came in with a pistol and said\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, in fact, I cannot say I recall precisely what was said. There appeared to have been a slight misapprehension, owing to his impression that the lady\u2019s outcry was occasioned by some inopportune motion or speech of my own, rather than by the arachnid. Fortunately, I was able to display the beast to him, whereupon the lady was induced to come so far as the door\u2014we could not persuade her to enter the room again\u2014and identify it as the cause of her distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said. I could envision the scene very well indeed, save for one point of paramount interest. \u201cDo you happen to recall what he was wearing? Jamie?\u201d</p><p>Lawrence Stern looked blank. \u201cWearing? Why...no. My impression is that he was clad for the street, rather than in dishabille, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI only wondered.\u201d \u201cClad,\u201d after all, was the operative word. \u201cSo he introduced himself to you?\u201d</p><p>Stern frowned, running a hand through his thick black curls. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he did. As I recall, the lady referred to him as Mr. Fraser; sometime later in the conversation\u2014we availed ourselves of suitable refreshment and remained conversing nearly until the dawn, finding considerable interest in each other\u2019s company, you see. At some point, he invited me to address him by his given name.\u201d He raised one eyebrow sardonically. \u201cI trust you do not think it overfamiliar of me to have done so, upon such brief acquaintance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Of course not.\u201d Wanting to change the subject, I continued, \u201cYou said you talked about spiders and caves? Why caves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy way of Robert the Bruce and the story\u2014which your husband was inclined to think apocryphal\u2014regarding his inspiration to persevere in his quest for the throne of Scotland. Presumably, the Bruce was in hiding in a cave, pursued by his enemies, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know the story,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIt was James\u2019s opinion that spiders do not frequent caves in which humans dwell; an opinion with which I basically concurred, though pointing out that in the larger type of cave, such as occurs on this island\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are caves here?\u201d I was surprised, and then felt foolish. \u201cBut of course, there must be, if there are cave fish, like the one in the spring. I always thought Caribbean islands were made of coral, though. I shouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d find caves in coral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is possible, though not highly likely,\u201d Stern said judiciously. \u201cHowever, the island of Hispaniola is not a coral atoll but is basically volcanic in origin\u2014with the addition of crystalline schists, fossiliferous sedimentary deposits of a considerable antiquity, and widespread deposits of limestone. The limestone is particularly karstic in spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d I poured a fresh cup of spiced wine.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Lawrence leaned over to pick up his bag from the floor of the veranda. Pulling out a notebook, he tore a sheet of paper from it and crumpled it in his fist.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. The paper slowly unfolded itself, leaving a mazed topography of creases and crumpled peaks. \u201cThat is what this island is like\u2014you remember what Father Fogden was saying about the Maroons? The runaway slaves who have taken refuge in these hills? It is not lack of pursuit on the part of their masters that allows them to vanish with such ease. There are many parts of this island where no man\u2014white or black, I daresay\u2014has yet set foot. And in the lost hills, there are caves still more lost, whose existence no one knows save perhaps the aboriginal inhabitants of this place\u2014and they are long gone, Mrs. Fraser. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have seen one such cave,\u201d he added reflectively. \u201cAbandawe, the Maroons call it. They consider it a most sinister and sacred spot, though I do not know why.\u201d</p><p>Encouraged by my close attention, he took another gulp of sangria and continued his natural history lecture.</p><p>\u201cNow that small island\u201d\u2014he nodded at the floating island visible in the sea beyond\u2014\u201cthat is the Ile de la Tortue\u2014Tortuga. That one is in fact a coral atoll, its lagoon long since filled in by the actions of the coral animalculae. Did you know it was once the haunt of pirates?\u201d he asked, apparently feeling that he ought to infuse his lecture with something of more general interest than karstic formations and crystalline schists.</p><p>\u201cReal pirates? Buccaneers, you mean?\u201d I viewed the little island with more interest. \u201cThat\u2019s rather romantic.\u201d</p> <p>Stern laughed, and I glanced at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI am not laughing at you, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he assured me. A smile lingered on his lips as he gestured at the Ile de la Tortue. \u201cIt is merely that I had occasion once to talk with an elderly resident of Kingston, regarding the habits of the buccaneers who had at one point made their headquarters in the nearby village of Port Royal.\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips, decided to speak, decided otherwise, then, with a sideways glance at me, decided to risk it. \u201cYou will pardon the indelicacy, Mrs. Fraser, but as you are a married woman, and as I understand, have some familiarity with the practice of medicine\u2014\u201d He paused, and might have stopped there, but he had drunk nearly two-thirds of the pitcher; the broad, pleasant face was deeply flushed.</p><p>\u201cYou have perhaps heard of the abominable practices of sodomy?\u201d he asked, looking at me sideways.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assure you,\u201d he said, with a magisterial nod. \u201cMy informant was most discursive upon the habits of the buccaneers. Sodomites to a man,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a matter of public knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cMy informant told me that when Port Royal fell into the sea some sixty years ago, it was widely assumed to be an act of divine vengeance upon these wicked persons in retribution for their vile and unnatural usages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracious,\u201d I said. I wondered what the voluptuous Tessa of The Impetuous Pirate would have thought about this.</p><p>He nodded, solemn as an owl.</p><p>\u201cThey say you can hear the bells of the drowned churches of Port Royal when a storm is coming, ringing for the souls of the damned pirates.\u201d</p> <p>I thought of inquiring further into the precise nature of the vile and unnatural usages, but at this point in the proceedings, Mamacita stumped out onto the veranda, said curtly, \u201cFood,\u201d and disappeared again.</p><p>\u201cI wonder which cave Father Fogden found her in,\u201d I said, shoving back my chair.</p><p>Stern glanced at me in surprise. \u201cFound her? But I forgot,\u201d he said, face clearing, \u201cyou don\u2019t know.\u201d He peered at the open door where the old woman had vanished, but the interior of the house was quiet and dark as a cave.</p><p>\u201cHe found her in Habana,\u201d he said, and told me the rest of the story.</p><p>Father Fogden had been a priest for ten years, a missionary of the order of St. Anselm, when he had come to Cuba fifteen years before. Devoted to the needs of the poor, he had worked among the slums and stews of Habana for several years, thinking of nothing more than the relief of suffering and the love of God\u2014until the day he met Ermenegilda Ruiz Alcantara y Meroz in the marketplace.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose he knows, even now, how it happened,\u201d Stern said. He wiped away a drop of wine that ran down the side of his cup, and drank again. \u201cPerhaps she didn\u2019t know, either, or perhaps she planned it from the moment she saw him.\u201d</p><p>In any case, six months later the city of Habana was agog at the news that the young wife of Don Armando Alcantara had run away\u2014with a priest.</p><p>\u201cAnd her mother,\u201d I said, under my breath, but he heard me, and smiled slightly.</p> <p>\u201cErmenegilda would never leave Mamacita behind,\u201d he said. \u201cNor her dog Ludo.\u201d</p><p>They would never have succeeded in escaping\u2014for the reach of Don Armando was long and powerful\u2014save for the fact that the English conveniently chose the day of their elopement to invade the island of Cuba, and Don Armando had many things more important to worry him than the whereabouts of his runaway young wife.</p><p>The fugitives rode to Bayamo\u2014much hampered by Ermenegilda\u2019s dresses, with which she would not part\u2014and there hired a fishing boat, which carried them to safety on Hispaniola.</p><p>\u201cShe died two years later,\u201d Stern said abruptly. He set down his cup, and refilled it from the sweating pitcher. \u201cHe buried her himself, under the bougainvillaea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here they\u2019ve stayed since,\u201d I said. \u201cThe priest, and Ludo and Mamacita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Stern closed his eyes, his profile dark against the setting sun. \u201cErmenegilda would not leave Mamacita, and Mamacita will never leave Ermenegilda.\u201d</p><p>He tossed back the rest of his cup of sangria.</p><p>\u201cNo one comes here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe villagers won\u2019t set foot on the hill. They\u2019re afraid of Ermenegilda\u2019s ghost. A damned sinner, buried by a reprobate priest in unhallowed ground\u2014of course she will not lie quiet.\u201d</p><p>The sea breeze was cool on the back of my neck. Behind us, even the chickens in the patio had grown quiet with falling twilight. The Hacienda de la Fuente lay still.</p><p>\u201cYou come,\u201d I said, and he smiled. The scent of oranges rose up from the empty cup in my hands, sweet as bridal flowers.</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a scientist. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d He extended a hand to me, somewhat unsteadily. \u201cShall we dine, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>After breakfast the next morning, Stern was ready to set off for St. Luis. Before leaving, though, I had a question or two about the ship the priest had mentioned; if it were the Porpoise, I wanted to steer clear of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of ship was it?\u201d I asked, pouring a cup of goat\u2019s milk to go with the breakfast of fried plantain.</p><p>Father Fogden, apparently little the worse for his excesses of the day before, was stroking his coconut, humming dreamily to himself.</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d he said, startled out of his reverie by Stern\u2019s poking him in the ribs. I patiently repeated my query.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He squinted in deep thought, then his face relaxed. \u201cA wooden one.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence bent his broad face over his plate, hiding a smile. I took a breath and tried again.</p><p>\u201cThe sailors who killed Arabella\u2014did you see them?\u201d</p><p>His narrow brows rose.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I saw them. How else would I know they had done it?\u201d</p><p>I seized on this evidence of logical thought.</p><p>\u201cNaturally. And did you see what they were wearing? I mean\u201d\u2014I saw him opening his mouth to say \u201cclothes,\u201d and hastily forestalled him\u2014\u201cdid they seem to be wearing any sort of uniform?\u201d The crew of the Porpoise commonly wore \u201cslops\u201d when not performing any ceremonial duty, but even these rough clothes bore the semblance of a uniform, being mostly all of a dirty white and similar in cut.</p><p>Father Fogden laid down his cup, leaving a milky mustache across his upper lip. He brushed at this with the back of his hand, frowning and shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think not. All I recall of them, though, is that the leader wore a hook\u2014missing a hand, I mean.\u201d He waggled his own long fingers at me in illustration.</p><p>I dropped my cup, which exploded on the tabletop. Stern sprang up with an exclamation, but the priest sat still, watching in surprise as a thin white stream ran across the table and into his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhatever did you do that for?\u201d he said reproachfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. My hands were trembling so that I couldn\u2019t even manage to pick up the shards of the shattered cup. I was afraid to ask the next question. \u201cFather\u2014has the ship sailed away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy no,\u201d he said, looking up in surprise from his damp robe. \u201cHow could it? It\u2019s on the beach.\u201d</p><p>Father Fogden led the way, his skinny shanks a gleaming white as he kirtled his cassock about his thighs. I was obliged to do the same, for the hillside above the house was thick with grass and thorny shrubs that caught at the coarse wool skirts of my borrowed robe.</p><p>The hill was crisscrossed with sheep paths, but these were narrow and faint, losing themselves under the trees and disappearing abruptly in thick grass. The priest seemed confident about his destination, though, and scampered briskly through the vegetation, never looking back.</p><p>I was breathing hard by the time we reached the crest of the hill, even though Lawrence Stern had gallantly assisted me, pushing branches out of my way, and taking my arm to haul me up the steeper slopes.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there really is a ship?\u201d I said to him, low-voiced, as we approached the top of the hill. Given our host\u2019s behavior so far, I wasn\u2019t so sure he might not have imagined it, just to be sociable.</p><p>Stern shrugged, wiping a trickle of sweat that ran down his bronzed cheek.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there will be something there,\u201d he replied. \u201cAfter all, there is a dead sheep.\u201d</p><p>A qualm ran over me in memory of the late departed Arabella. Someone had killed the sheep, and I walked as quietly as I could, as we approached the top of the hill. It couldn\u2019t be the Porpoise; none of her officers or men wore a hook. I tried to tell myself that it likely wasn\u2019t the Artemis, either, but my heart beat still faster as we came to a stand of giant agave on the crest of the hill.</p><p>I could see the Caribbean glowing blue through the succulent\u2019s branches, and a narrow strip of white beach. Father Fogden had come to a halt, beckoning us to his side.</p><p>\u201cThere they are, the wicked creatures,\u201d he muttered. His blue eyes glittered bright with fury, and his scanty hair fairly bristled, like a moth-eaten porcupine. \u201cButchers!\u201d he said, hushed but vehement, as though talking to himself. \u201cCannibals!\u201d</p><p>I gave him a startled look, but then Lawrence Stern grasped my arm, drawing me to a wider opening between two trees.</p><p>\u201cOy! There is a ship,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was. It was lying tilted on its side, drawn up on the beach, its masts unstepped, untidy piles of cargo, sails, rigging, and water casks scattered all about it. Men crawled over the beached carcass like ants. Shouts and hammer blows rang out like gunshots, and the smell of hot pitch was thick on the air. The unloaded cargo gleamed dully in the sun; copper and tin, slightly tarnished by the sea air. Tanned hides had been laid flat on the sand, brown stiff blotches drying in the sun.</p><p>\u201cIt is them! It\u2019s the Artemis!\u201d The matter was settled by the appearance near the hull of a squat, one-legged figure, head shaded from the sun by a gaudy kerchief of yellow silk.</p><p>\u201cMurphy!\u201d I shouted. \u201cFergus! Jamie!\u201d I broke from Stern\u2019s grasp and ran down the far side of the hill, his cry of caution disregarded in the excitement of seeing the Artemis.</p><p>Murphy whirled at my shout, but was unable to get out of my way. Carried by momentum and moving like a runaway freight, I crashed straight into him, knocking him flat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMurphy!\u201d I said, and kissed him, caught up in the joy of the moment.</p><p>\u201cHoy!\u201d he said, shocked. He wriggled madly, trying to get out from under me.</p><p>\u201cMilady!\u201d Fergus appeared at my side, crumpled and vivid, his beautiful smile dazzling in a sun-dark face. \u201cMilady!\u201d He helped me off the grunting Murphy, then grabbed me to him in a rib-cracking hug. Marsali appeared behind him, a broad smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cMerci aux les saints!\u201d he said in my ear. \u201cI was afraid we would never see you again!\u201d He kissed me heartily himself, on both cheeks and the mouth, then released me at last.</p> <p>I glanced at the Artemis, lying on her side on the beach like a stranded beetle. \u201cWhat on earth happened?\u201d</p><p>Fergus and Marsali exchanged a glance. It was the sort of look in which questions are asked and answered, and it rather startled me to see the depths of intimacy between them. Fergus drew a deep breath and turned to me.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Raines is dead,\u201d he said.</p><p>The storm that had come upon me during my night in the mangrove swamp had also struck the Artemis. Carried far off her path by the howling wind, she had been forced over a reef, tearing a sizable hole in her bottom.</p><p>Still, she had remained afloat. The aft hold filling rapidly, she had limped toward the small inlet that opened so near, offering shelter.</p> <p>\u201cWe were no more than three hundred yards from the shore when the accident happened,\u201d Fergus said, his face drawn by the memory. The ship had heeled suddenly over, as the contents of the aft hold had shifted, beginning to float. And just then, an enormous wave, coming from the sea, had struck the leaning ship, washing across the tilting quarterdeck, and carrying away Captain Raines, and four seamen with him.</p><p>\u201cThe shore was so near!\u201d Marsali said, her face twisted with distress. \u201cWe were aground ten minutes later! If only\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fergus stopped her with a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot guess God\u2019s ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been the same, if we had been a thousand miles at sea, save that we would not have been able to give them decent burial.\u201d He nodded toward the far edge of the beach, near the jungle, where five small mounds, topped with crude wooden crosses, marked the final resting places of the drowned men.</p><p>\u201cI had some holy water that Da brought me from Notre Dame in Paris,\u201d Marsali said. Her lips were cracked, and she licked them. \u201cIn a little bottle. I said a prayer, and sprinkled it on the graves. D\u2019ye\u2014d\u2019ye think they would have l-liked that?\u201d</p><p>I caught the quaver in her voice, and realized that for all her self-possession, the last two days had been a terrifying ordeal for the girl. Her face was grimy, her hair coming down, and the sharpness was gone from her eyes, softened by tears.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they would,\u201d I said gently, patting her arm. I glanced at the faces crowding around, searching for Jamie\u2019s great height and fiery head, even as the realization dawned that he was not there.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jamie?\u201d I said. My face was flushed from the run down the hill. I felt the blood begin to drain from my cheeks, as a trickle of fear rose in my veins.</p><p>Fergus was staring at me, lean face mirroring mine.</p><p>\u201cHe is not with you?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. How could he be?\u201d The sun was blinding, but my skin felt cold. I could feel the heat shimmer over me, but to no effect. My lips were so chilled, I could scarcely form the question.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>Fergus shook his head slowly back and forth, like an ox stunned by the slaughterer\u2019s blow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>51</p><p>IN WHICH JAMIE SMELLS A RAT</p><p>Jamie Fraser lay in the shadows under the Porpoise\u2019s jolly boat, chest heaving with effort. Getting aboard the man-of-war without being seen had been no small task; his right side was bruised from being slammed against the side of the ship as he hung from the boarding nets, struggling to pull himself up to the rail. His arms felt as though they had been jerked from their sockets and there was a large splinter in one hand. But he was here, and so far unseen.</p><p>He chewed delicately at his palm, groping for the end of the splinter with his teeth, as he got his bearings. Russo and Stone, Artemis hands who had served aboard men-of-war, had spent hours describing to him the structure of a large ship, the compartments and decks, and the probable location of the surgeon\u2019s quarters. Hearing something described and being able to find your way about in it were two different things, though. At least the miserable thing rocked less than the Artemis, though he could still feel the subtle, nauseating heave of the deck beneath him.</p><p>The end of the splinter worked free; nipping it between his teeth, he drew it slowly out and spat it on the deck. He sucked the tiny wound, tasting blood, and slid cautiously out from under the jolly boat, ears pricked to catch the sound of an approaching footstep.</p><p>The deck below this one, down the forward companionway. The officers\u2019 quarters would be there, and with luck, the surgeon\u2019s cabin as well. Not that she was likely to be in her quarters; not her. She\u2019d cared enough to come tend the sick\u2014she would be with them.</p><p>He had waited until dark to have Robbie MacRae row him out. Raines had told him that the Porpoise would likely weigh anchor with the evening tide, two hours from now. If he could find Claire and escape over the side before that\u2014he could swim ashore with her, easily\u2014the Artemis would be waiting for them, concealed in a small cove on the other side of Caicos Island. If he couldn\u2019t\u2014well, he would deal with that when he came to it.</p><p>Fresh from the cramped small world of the Artemis, the belowdecks of the Porpoise seemed huge and sprawling; a shadowed warren. He stood still, nostrils flaring as he deliberately drew the fetid air deep into his lungs. There were all the nasty stenches associated with a ship at sea for a long time, overlaid with the faint floating stink of feces and vomit.</p><p>He turned to the left and began to walk softly, long nose twitching. Where the smell of sickness was the strongest; that was where he would find her.</p><p>Four hours later, in mounting desperation, he made his way aft for the third time. He had covered the entire ship\u2014keeping out of sight with some difficulty\u2014and Claire was nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cBloody woman!\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cWhere have ye gone, ye fashious wee hidee?\u201d</p><p>A small worm of fear gnawed at the base of his heart. She had said her vaccine would protect her from the sickness, but what if she had been wrong? He could see for himself that the man-of-war\u2019s crew had been badly diminished by the deadly sickness\u2014knee-deep in it, the germs might have attacked her too, vaccine or not.</p><p>He thought of germs as small blind things, about the size of maggots, but equipped with vicious razor teeth, like tiny sharks. He could all too easily imagine a swarm of the things fastening onto her, killing her, draining her flesh of life. It was just such a vision that had made him pursue the Porpoise\u2014that, and a murderous rage toward the English buggerer who had had the filth-eating insolence to steal away his wife beneath his very nose, with a vague promise to return her, once they\u2019d made use of her.</p><p>Leave her to the Sassenachs, unprotected?</p><p>\u201cNot bloody likely,\u201d he muttered under his breath, dropping down into a dark cargo space. She wouldn\u2019t be in such a place, of course, but he must think a moment, what to do. Was this the cable tier, the aft cargo hatch, the forward stinking God knew what? Christ, he hated boats!</p><p>He drew in a deep breath and stopped, surprised. There were animals here; goats. He could smell them plainly. There was also a light, dimly visible around the edge of a bulkhead, and the murmur of voices. Was one of them a woman\u2019s voice?</p><p>He edged forward, listening. There were feet on the deck above, a patter and thump that he recognized; bodies dropping from the rigging. Had someone above seen him? Well, and if they had? It was no crime, so far as he knew, for a man to come seeking his wife.</p><p>The Porpoise was asail; he had felt the thrum of the sails, passing through the wood all the way to the keel as she took the wind. They had long since missed the rendezvous with the Artemis.</p><p>That being so, there was likely nothing to lose by appearing boldly before the captain and demanding to see Claire. But perhaps she was here\u2014it was a woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>It was a woman\u2019s figure, too, silhouetted against the lantern\u2019s light, but the woman wasn\u2019t Claire. His heart leapt convulsively at the gleam of the light on her hair, but then fell at once as he saw the thick, square shape of the woman by the goat pen. There was a man with her; as Jamie watched, the man bent and picked up a basket. He turned and came toward Jamie.</p><p>He stepped into the narrow aisle between the bulkheads, blocking the seaman\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cHere, what do you mean\u2014\u201d the man began, and then, raising his eyes to Jamie\u2019s face, stopped, gasping. One eye was fixed on him in horrified recognition; the other showed only as a bluish-white crescent beneath the withered lid.</p><p>\u201cGod preserve us!\u201d the seaman said. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The seaman\u2019s face gleamed pale and jaundiced in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cYe ken me, do ye?\u201d Jamie\u2019s heart was hammering against his ribs, but he kept his voice level and low. \u201cI have not the honor to know your own name, I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should prefer to leave that particular circumstance unchanged, your honor, if you\u2019ve no objection.\u201d The one-eyed seaman began to edge backward, but was forestalled as Jamie gripped his arm, hard enough to elicit a small yelp.</p><p>\u201cNot quite so fast, if ye please. Where is Mrs. Malcolm, the surgeon?\u201d</p><p>It would have been difficult for the seaman to look more alarmed, but at this question, he managed it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d Jamie said sharply. \u201cAnd ye\u2019ll tell me this minute, or I shall break your neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I can\u2019t be tellin\u2019 you anything if you break my neck, can I?\u201d the seaman pointed out, beginning to recover his nerve. He lifted his chin pugnaciously over his basket of manure. \u201cNow, you leave go of me, or I\u2019ll call\u2014\u201d The rest was lost in a squawk as a large hand fastened about his neck and began inexorably to squeeze. The basket fell to the deck, and balls of goat manure exploded out of it like shrapnel.</p><p>\u201cAk!\u201d Harry Tompkins\u2019s legs thrashed wildly, scattering goat dung in every direction. His face turned the color of a beetroot as he clawed ineffectually at Jamie\u2019s arm. Judging the results clinically, Jamie let go as the man\u2019s eye began to bulge. He wiped his hand on his breeches, disliking the greasy feel of the man\u2019s sweat on his palm.</p><p>Tompkins lay on the deck in a sprawl of limbs, wheezing faintly.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re quite right,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cOn the other hand, if I break your arm, I expect you\u2019ll still be able to speak to me, aye?\u201d He bent, grasped the man by one skinny arm and jerked him to his feet, twisting the arm roughly behind his back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d The seaman wriggled madly, panicked. \u201cDamn you, you\u2019re as wicked cruel as she was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas? What do you mean, \u2018was\u2019?\u201d Jamie\u2019s heart squeezed tight in his chest, and he jerked the arm, more roughly than he had meant to do. Tompkins let out a screech of pain, and Jamie slackened the pressure slightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet go! I\u2019ll tell you, but for pity\u2019s sake, let go!\u201d Jamie lessened his grasp, but didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cTell me where my wife is!\u201d he said, in a tone that had made stronger men than Harry Tompkins fall over their feet to obey.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lost!\u201d the man blurted. \u201cGone overboard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d He was so stunned that he let go his hold. Overboard. Gone overboard. Lost.</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHow? Damn you, tell me what happened!\u201d He advanced on the seaman, fists clenched.</p><p>The seaman was backing away, rubbing his arm and panting, a look of furtive satisfaction in his one eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your honor,\u201d he said, a queer, jeering tone in his voice. \u201cYou won\u2019t be lonesome long. You\u2019ll join her in hell in a few days\u2014dancing from the yardarm over Kingston Harbor!\u201d</p><p>Too late, Jamie heard the footfall on the boards behind him. He had no time even to turn his head before the blow fell.</p><p>He had been struck in the head frequently enough to know that the sensible thing was to lie still until the giddiness and the lights that pulsed behind your eyelids with each heartbeat stopped. Sit up too soon and the pain made you vomit.</p> <p>The deck was rising and falling, rising and falling under him, in the horrible way of ships. He kept his eyes tight closed, concentrating on the knotted ache at the base of his skull in order not to think of his stomach.</p><p>Ship. He should be on a ship. Yes, but the surface under his cheek was wrong\u2014hard wood, not the linen of his berth\u2019s bedding. And the smell, the smell was wrong, it was\u2014</p><p>He shot bolt upright, memory shooting through him with a vividness that made the pain in his head pale by comparison. The darkness moved queasily around him, blinking with colored lights, and his stomach heaved. He closed his eyes and swallowed hard, trying to gather his scattered wits about the single appalling thought that had lanced through his brain like a spit through mutton.</p><p>Claire. Lost. Drowned. Dead.</p><p>He leaned to the side and threw up. He retched and coughed, as though his body was trying forcibly to expel the thought. It didn\u2019t work; when he finally stopped, leaning against the bulkhead in exhaustion, it was still with him. It hurt to breathe, and he clenched his fists on his thighs, trembling.</p><p>There was the sound of a door opening, and bright light struck him in the eyes with the force of a blow. He winced, closing his eyes against the glare of the lantern.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d a soft, well-bred voice said. \u201cI am\u2014truly sorry. I wish you to know that, at least.\u201d</p><p>Through a cracked eyelid, he saw the drawn, harried face of young Leonard\u2014the man who had taken Claire. The man wore a look of regret. Regret! Regret, for killing her.</p><p>Fury pulled him up against the weakness, and sent him lunging across the slanted deck in an instant. There was an outcry as he hit Leonard and bore him backward into the passage, and a good, juicy thunk! as the bugger\u2019s head hit the boards. People were shouting, and shadows leapt crazily all round him as the lanterns swayed, but he paid no attention.</p><p>He smashed Leonard\u2019s jaw with one great blow, his nose with the next. The weakness mattered nothing. He would spend all his strength and die here glad, but let him batter and maim now, feel the bones crack and the blood hot and slick on his fists. Blessed Michael, let him avenge her first!</p><p>There were hands on him, snatching and jerking, but they didn\u2019t matter. They would kill him now, he thought dimly, and that didn\u2019t matter, either. The body under him jerked and twitched between his legs, and lay still.</p><p>When the next blow came, he went willingly into the dark.</p><p>The light touch of fingers on his face awakened him. He reached drowsily up to take her hand, and his palm touched...</p><p>\u201cAaaah!\u201d</p> <p>With an instinctive revulsion, he was on his feet, clawing at his face. The big spider, nearly as frightened as he was, made off toward the shrubbery at high speed, long hairy legs no more than a blur.</p><p>There was an outburst of giggling behind him. He turned around, his heart pounding like a drum, and found six children, roosting in the branches of a big green tree, all grinning down at him with tobacco-stained teeth.</p><p>He bowed to them, feeling dizzy and rubber-legged, the start of fright that had got him up now dying in his blood.</p><p>\u201cMesdemoiselles, messieurs,\u201d he said, croaking, and in the half-awake recesses of his brain wondered what had made him speak to them in French? Had he half-heard them speaking, as he lay asleep?</p><p>French they were, for they answered him in that language, strongly laced with a gutteral sort of creole accent that he had never heard before.</p><p>\u201cVous \u00eates matelot?\u201d the biggest boy asked, eyeing him with interest.</p><p>His knees gave way and he sat down on the ground, suddenly enough to make the children laugh again.</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d he replied, struggling to make his tongue work. \u201cJe suis guerrier.\u201d His mouth was dry and his head ached like a fiend. Faint memories swam about in the parritch that filled his head, too vague to grasp.</p><p>\u201cA soldier!\u201d exclaimed one of the smaller children. His eyes were round and dark as sloes. \u201cWhere is your sword and pistola, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d an older girl told him loftily. \u201cHow could he swim with a pistola? It would be ruined. Don\u2019t you know any better, guava-head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d the smaller boy shouted, face contorting in rage. \u201cShitface!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrog-guts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaca-brains!\u201d</p><p>The children were scrabbling through the branches like monkeys, screaming and chasing each other. Jamie rubbed a hand hard over his face, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cMademoiselle!\u201d He caught the eye of the older girl and beckoned to her. She hesitated for a moment, then dropped from her branch like a ripe fruit, landing on the ground before him in a puff of yellow dust. She was barefoot, wearing nothing but a muslin shift and a colored kerchief round her dark, curly hair.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem a woman of some knowledge, Mademoiselle,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me, please, what is the name of this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCap-Ha\u00eftien,\u201d she replied promptly. She eyed him with considerable curiosity. \u201cYou talk funny,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am thirsty. Is there water nearby?\u201d Cap-Ha\u00eftien. So he was on the island of Hispaniola. His mind was slowly beginning to function again; he had a vague memory of terrible effort, of swimming for his life in a frothing cauldron of heaving waves, and rain pelting his face so hard that it made little difference whether his head was above or below the surface. And what else?</p><p>\u201cThis way, this way!\u201d The other children had dropped out of the tree, and a little girl was tugging his hand, urging him to follow.</p><p>He knelt by the little stream, splashing water over his head, gulping delicious cool handfuls, while the children scampered over the rocks, pelting each other with mud.</p><p>Now he remembered\u2014the rat-faced seaman, and Leonard\u2019s surprised young face, the deep-red rage and the satisfying feel of flesh crushed against bone under his fist.</p><p>And Claire. The memory came back suddenly, with a sense of confused emotion\u2014loss and terror, succeeded by relief. What had happened? He stopped what he was doing, not hearing the questions the children were flinging at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you a deserter?\u201d one of the boys asked again. \u201cHave you been in a fight?\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes rested curiously on his hands. His knuckles were cut and swollen, and his hands ached badly; the fourth finger felt as though he had cracked it again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said absently, his mind occupied. Everything was coming back; the dark, stuffy confines of the brig where they had left him to wake, and the dreadful waking, to the thought that Claire was dead. He had huddled there on the bare boards, too shaken with grief to notice at first the increasing heave and roll of the ship, or the high-pitched whine of the rigging, loud enough to filter down even to his oubliette.</p><p>But after a time, the motion and noise were great enough to penetrate even the cloud of grief. He had heard the sounds of the growing storm, and the shouts and running overhead, and then was much too occupied to think of anything.</p><p>There was nothing in the small room with him, nothing to hold to. He had bounced from wall to wall like a dried pea in a wean\u2019s rattle, unable to tell up from down, right from left in the heaving dark, and not much caring, either, as waves of seasickness rolled through his body. He had thought then of nothing but death, and that with a fervor of longing.</p><p>He had been nearly unconscious, in fact, when the door to his prison had opened, and a strong smell of goat assailed his nostrils. He had no idea how the woman had got him up the ladder to the afterdeck, or why. He had only a confused memory of her babbling urgently to him in broken English as she pulled him along, half-supporting his weight as he stumbled and slid on the rain-wet decking.</p><p>He remembered the last thing she had said, though, as she pushed him toward the tilting taffrail.</p><p>\u201cShe is not dead,\u201d the woman had said. \u201cShe go there\u201d\u2014pointing at the rolling sea\u2014\u201cyou go, too. Find her!\u201d and then she had bent, got a hand in his crutch and a sturdy shoulder under his rump, and heaved him neatly over the rail and into the churning water.</p><p>\u201cYou are not an Englishman,\u201d the boy was saying. \u201cIt\u2019s an English ship, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He turned automatically, to look where the boy pointed, and saw the Porpoise, riding at anchor far out in the shallow bay. Other ships were scattered throughout the harbor, all clearly visible from this vantage point on a hill just outside the town.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said to the boy. \u201cAn English ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne for me!\u201d the boy exclaimed happily. He turned to shout to another lad. \u201cJacques! I was right! English! That\u2019s four for me, and only two for you this month!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree!\u201d Jacques corrected indignantly. \u201cI get Spanish and Portuguese. Bruja was Portuguese, so I can count that, too!\u201d</p><p>Jamie reached out and caught the older boy\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cPardon, Monsieur,\u201d he said. \u201cYour friend said Bruja?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was in last week,\u201d the boy answered. \u201cIs Bruja a Portuguese name, though? We weren\u2019t sure whether to count it Spanish or Portuguese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the sailors were in my maman\u2019s taverna,\u201d one of the little girls chimed in. \u201cThey sounded like they were talking Spanish, but it wasn\u2019t like Uncle Geraldo talks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I should like to talk to your maman, ch\u00e8rie,\u201d he said to the little girl. \u201cDo any of you know, perhaps, where this Bruja was going when she left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBridgetown,\u201d the oldest girl put in promptly, trying to regain his attention. \u201cI heard the clerk at the garrison say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe garrison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe barracks are next door to my maman\u2019s taverna,\u201d the smaller girl chimed in, tugging at his sleeve. \u201cThe ship captains all go there with their papers, while the sailors get drunk. Come, come! Maman will feed you if I tell her to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your maman will throw me out the door,\u201d he told her, rubbing a hand across the heavy stubble on his chin. \u201cI look like a vagabond.\u201d He did. There were stains of blood and vomit on his clothes despite the swim, and he knew by the feel of his face that it was bruised and bloodshot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaman has seen much worse than you,\u201d the little girl assured him. \u201cCome on!\u201d</p><p>He smiled and thanked her, and allowed them to lead him down the hill, staggering slightly, as his land legs had not yet returned. He found it odd but somehow comforting that the children should not be frightened of him, horrible as he no doubt looked.</p><p>Was this what the goat-woman had meant? That Claire had swum ashore on this island? He felt a welling of hope that was as refreshing to his heart as the water had been to his parched throat. Claire was stubborn, reckless, and had a great deal more courage than was safe for a woman, but she was by no means such a fool as to fall off a man-of-war by accident.</p><p>And the Bruja\u2014and Ian\u2014were nearby! He would find them both, then. The fact that he was barefoot, penniless, and a fugitive from the Royal Navy seemed of no consequence. He had his wits and his hands, and with dry land once more beneath his feet, all things seemed possible.</p> <p>52</p><p>A WEDDING TAKES PLACE</p><p>There was nothing to be done, but to repair the Artemis as quickly as possible, and make sail for Jamaica. I did my best to put aside my fear for Jamie, but I scarcely ate for the next two days, my appetite impeded by the large ball of ice that had taken up residence in my stomach.</p><p>For distraction, I took Marsali up to the house on the hill, where she succeeded in charming Father Fogden by recalling\u2014and mixing for him\u2014a Scottish receipt for a sheep-dip guaranteed to destroy ticks.</p><p>Stern helpfully pitched in with the labor of repair, delegating to me the guardianship of his specimen bag, and charging me with the task of searching the nearby jungle for any curious specimens of Arachnida that might come to hand as I looked for medicinal plants. While thinking privately that I would prefer to meet any of the larger specimens of Arachnida with a good stout boot, rather than my bare hands, I accepted the charge, peering into the internal water-filled cups of bromeliads in search of the bright-colored frogs and spiders who inhabited these tiny worlds.</p> <p>I returned from one of these expeditions on the afternoon of the third day, with several large lily-roots, some shelf fungus of a vivid orange, and an unusual moss, together with a live tarantula\u2014carefully trapped in one of the sailor\u2019s stocking caps and held at arm\u2019s length\u2014large and hairy enough to send Lawrence into paroxysms of delight.</p><p>When I emerged from the jungle\u2019s edge, I saw that we had reached a new stage of progress; the Artemis was no longer canted on her side, but was slowly regaining an upright position on the sand, assisted by ropes, wedges, and a great deal of shouting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nearly finished, then?\u201d I asked Fergus, who was standing near the stern, doing a good bit of the shouting as he instructed his crew in the placement of wedges. He turned to me, grinning and wiping the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cYes, milady! The caulking is complete. Mr. Warren gives it as his opinion that we may launch the ship near evening, when the day is grown cool, so the tar is hardened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s marvelous!\u201d I craned my neck back, looking up at the naked mast that towered high above. \u201cHave we got sails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he assured me. \u201cIn fact, we have everything except\u2014\u201d</p> <p>A shout of alarm from MacLeod interrupted whatever he had been about to say. I whirled to look toward the distant road out of the palmettos, where the sun winked off the glint of metal.</p><p>\u201cSoldiers!\u201d Fergus reacted faster than anyone, leaping from the scaffolding to land in a thudding spray of sand beside me. \u201cQuick, milady! To the wood! Marsali!\u201d he shouted, looking wildly about for the girl.</p><p>He licked sweat from his upper lip, eyes darting from the jungle to the approaching soldiers. \u201cMarsali!\u201d he shouted, once more.</p><p>Marsali appeared round the edge of the hull, pale and startled. Fergus grasped her by the arm and shoved her toward me. \u201cGo with milady! Run!\u201d</p><p>I snatched Marsali\u2019s hand and ran for the forest, sand spurting beneath our feet. There were shouts from the road behind us, and a shot cracked overhead, followed by another.</p><p>Ten steps, five, and then we were in the shadow of the trees. I collapsed behind the shelter of a thorny bush, gasping for breath against the stabbing pain of a stitch in my side. Marsali knelt on the earth beside me, her cheeks streaked with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped, struggling for breath. \u201cWho are they? What\u2014will they\u2014do? To Fergus. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Still breathing heavily, I grasped a cedar sapling and pulled myself to my knees. Peering through the underbrush on all fours, I could see that the soldiers had reached the ship.</p> <p>It was cool and damp under the trees, but the lining of my mouth was dry as cotton. I bit the inside of my cheek, trying to encourage a little saliva to flow.</p><p>\u201cI think it will be all right.\u201d I patted Marsali\u2019s shoulder, trying to be reassuring. \u201cLook, there are only ten of them,\u201d I whispered, counting as the last soldier trotted out of the palmetto grove. \u201cThey\u2019re French; the Artemis has French papers. It may be all right.\u201d</p><p>And then again, it might not. I was well aware that a ship aground and abandoned was legal salvage. It was a deserted beach. And all that stood between these soldiers and a rich prize were the lives of the Artemis\u2019s crew.</p><p>A few of the seamen had pistols to hand; most had knives. But the soldiers were armed to the teeth, each man with musket, sword, and pistols. If it came to a fight, it would be a bloody one, but the odds were heavily on the mounted soldiers.</p><p>The men near the ship were silent, grouped close together behind Fergus, who stood out, straight-backed and grim, as the spokesman. I saw him push back his shock of hair with his hook, and plant his feet solidly in the sand, ready for whatever might come. The creak and jingle of harness seemed muted in the damp, hot air, and the horses moved slowly, hooves muffled in the sand.</p><p>The soldiers came to a halt ten feet away from the little knot of seamen. A big man who seemed to be in command raised one hand in an order to stay, and swung down from his horse.</p><p>I was watching Fergus, rather than the soldiers. I saw his face change, then freeze, white under his tan. I glanced quickly at the soldier coming toward him across the sand, and my own blood froze.</p><p>\u201cSilence, mes amis,\u201d said the big man, in a voice of pleasant command. \u201cSilence, et restez, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\u201d Silence, my friends, and do not move, if you please.</p><p>I would have fallen, were I not already on my knees. I closed my eyes in a wordless prayer of thanksgiving.</p><p>Next to me, Marsali gasped. I opened my eyes and clapped a hand over her open mouth.</p><p>The commander took off his hat, and shook out a thick mass of sweat-soaked auburn hair. He grinned at Fergus, teeth white and wolfish in a short, curly red beard.</p><p>\u201cYou are in charge here?\u201d Jamie said in French. \u201cYou, come with me. The rest\u201d\u2014he nodded at the crew, several of whom were goggling at him in open amazement\u2014\u201cyou stay where you are. Don\u2019t talk,\u201d he added, off-handedly.</p><p>Marsali jerked at my arm, and I realized how tightly I had been holding her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I whispered, letting go, but not taking my eyes from the beach.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Marsali hissed in my ear. Her face was pale with excitement, and the little freckles left by the sun stood out on her nose in contrast. \u201cHow did he get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Be quiet, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>The crew of the Artemis exchanged glances, waggled their eyebrows, and nudged each other in the ribs, but fortunately also obeyed orders and didn\u2019t speak. I hoped to heaven that their obvious excitement would be construed merely as consternation over their impending fate.</p><p>Jamie and Fergus had walked over toward the shore, conferring in low voices. Now they separated, Fergus coming back toward the hull with an expression of grim determination, Jamie calling the soldiers to dismount and gather round him.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tell what Jamie was saying to the soldiers, but Fergus was close enough for us to hear.</p><p>\u201cThese are soldiers from the garrison at Cap-Ha\u00eftien,\u201d he announced to the crew members. \u201cTheir commander\u2014Captain Alessandro\u2014\u201d he said, lifting his eyebrows and grimacing hideously to emphasize the name, \u201csays that they will assist us in launching the Artemis.\u201d This announcement was greeted with faint cheers from some of the men, and looks of bewilderment from others.</p><p>\u201cBut how did Mr. Fraser\u2014\u201d began Royce, a rather slow-witted seaman, his heavy brows drawn together in a puzzled frown. Fergus allowed no time for questions, but plunged into the midst of the crew, putting an arm about Royce\u2019s shoulders and dragging him toward the scaffolding, talking loudly to drown out any untoward remarks.</p><p>\u201cYes, is it not a most fortunate accident?\u201d he said loudly. I could see that he was twisting Royce\u2019s ear with his sound hand. \u201cMost fortunate indeed! Captain Alessandro says that a habitant on his way from his plantation saw the ship aground, and reported it to the garrison. With so much help, we will have the Artemis aswim in no time at all.\u201d He let go of Royce and clapped his hand sharply against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cCome, come, let us set to work at once! Manzetti\u2014up you go! MacLeod, MacGregor, seize your hammers! Maitland\u2014\u201d He spotted Maitland, standing on the sand gawking at Jamie. Fergus whirled and clapped the cabin boy on the back hard enough to make him stagger.</p><p>\u201cMaitland, mon enfant! Give us a song to speed our efforts!\u201d Looking rather dazed, Maitland began a tentative rendition of \u201cThe Nut-Brown Maid.\u201d A few of the seamen began to climb back onto the scaffolding, glancing suspiciously over their shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSing!\u201d Fergus bellowed, glaring up at them. Murphy, who appeared to be finding something extremely funny, mopped his sweating red face and obligingly joined in the song, his wheezing bass reinforcing Maitland\u2019s pure tenor.</p><p>Fergus stalked up and down beside the hull, exhorting, directing, urging\u2014and making such a spectacle of himself that few telltale glances went in Jamie\u2019s direction. The uncertain tap of hammers started up again.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamie was giving careful directions to his soldiers. I saw more than one Frenchman glance at the Artemis as he talked, with a look of dimly concealed greed that suggested that a selfless desire to help their fellow beings was perhaps not the motive uppermost in the soldiers\u2019 minds, no matter what Fergus had announced.</p><p>Still, the soldiers went to work willingly enough, stripping off their leather jerkins and laying aside most of their arms. Three of the soldiers, I noticed, did not join the work party, but remained on guard, fully armed, eyes sharp on the sailors\u2019 every move. Jamie alone remained aloof, watching everything.</p><p>\u201cShould we come out?\u201d Marsali murmured in my ear. \u201cIt seems safe, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. My eyes were fixed on Jamie. He stood in the shade of a tall palmetto, at ease, but erect. Behind the unfamiliar beard, his expression was unreadable, but I caught the faint movement at his side, as the two stiff fingers flickered once against his thigh.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><p>The work went on through the afternoon. The stack of wooden rollers mounted, cut ends scenting the air with the tang of fresh sap. Fergus\u2019s voice was hoarse, and his shirt clung wetly to his lean torso. The horses, hobbled, wandered slowly under the edge of the forest, browsing. The sailors had given up singing now, and had settled to work, with no more than an occasional glance toward the palmetto where Captain Alessandro stood in the shade, arms folded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sentry near the trees paced slowly up and down, musket carried at the ready, a wistful eye on the cool green shadows. He passed close enough on one circuit for me to see the dark, greasy curls dangling down his neck, and the pockmarks on his plump cheeks. He creaked and jingled as he walked. The rowel was missing from one of his spurs. He looked hot, and fairly cross.</p><p>It was a long wait, and the inquisitiveness of the forest midges made it longer still. After what seemed forever, though, I saw Jamie give a nod to one of the guards, and come from the beach toward the trees. I signed to Marsali to wait, and ducking under branches, ignoring the thick brush, I dodged madly toward the place where he had disappeared.</p><p>I popped breathlessly out from behind a bush, just as he was doing up the laces of his flies. His head jerked up at the sound, his eyes widened, and he let out a yell that would have summoned Arabella the sheep back from the dead, let alone the waiting sentry.</p><p>I dodged back into hiding, as crashing boots and shouts of inquiry headed in our direction.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019est bien!\u201d Jamie shouted. He sounded a trifle shaken. \u201cCe n\u2019est qu\u2019un serpent!\u201d</p><p>The sentry spoke an odd dialect of French, but appeared to be asking rather nervously whether the serpent was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cNon, c\u2019est innocent,\u201d Jamie answered. He waved at the sentry, whose inquiring head I could just see, peering reluctantly over the bush. The sentry, who seemed unenthusiastic about snakes, however innocent, disappeared promptly back to his duty.</p><p>Without hesitation, Jamie plunged into the bush.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d He crushed me tight against his chest. Then he grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me, hard.</p> <p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d he said, in a piercing whisper. \u201cI thought ye were dead for sure! How dare ye do something harebrained like jump off a ship in the middle of the night! Have ye no sense at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d I hissed. The shaking had made me bite my lip. \u201cLet go, I say! What do you mean, how dare I do something harebrained? You idiot, what possessed you to follow me?\u201d</p><p>His face was darkened by the sun; now a deep red began to darken it further, washing up from the edges of his new beard.</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed me?\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, for the Lord\u2019s sake! Of course I would follow ye; why did ye not wait for me? Christ, if I had time, I\u2019d\u2014\u201d The mention of time evidently reminded him that we hadn\u2019t much, and with a noticeable effort, he choked back any further remarks, which was just as well, because I had a number of things to say in that vein myself. I swallowed them, with some difficulty.</p><p>\u201cWhat in bloody hell are you doing here?\u201d I asked instead.</p><p>The deep flush subsided slightly, succeeded by the merest hint of a smile amid the unfamiliar foliage.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the captain,\u201d he said. \u201cDid ye not notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I noticed! Captain Alessandro, my foot! What do you mean to do?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he gave me a final, gentle shake and divided a glare between me and Marsali, who had poked an inquiring head out.</p><p>\u201cStay here, the both of ye, and dinna stir a foot or I swear I\u2019ll beat ye senseless.\u201d</p><p>Without pausing for a response, he whirled and strode back through the trees, toward the beach.</p><p>Marsali and I exchanged stares, which were interrupted a second later, when Jamie, breathless, hurtled back into the small clearing. He grabbed me by both arms, and kissed me briefly but thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cI forgot. I love you,\u201d he said, giving me another shake for emphasis. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you\u2019re no dead. Dinna do that again!\u201d Letting go, he crashed back into the brush and disappeared.</p><p>I felt breathless, myself, and more than a little rattled, but undeniably happy.</p> <p>Marsali\u2019s eyes were round as saucers.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s Da going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. My cheeks were flushed, and I could still feel the touch of his mouth on mine, and the unfamiliar tingling left by the brush of beard and mustache. My tongue touched the small stinging place where I had bitten my lip. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d I repeated. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>It was a long wait. I was dozing against the trunk of a huge tree, near dusk, when Marsali\u2019s hand on my shoulder brought me awake.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re launching the ship!\u201d she said in an excited whisper.</p><p>They were; under the eyes of the sentries, the remaining soldiers and the crew of the Artemis were all manning the ropes and rollers that would move her down the beach into the waters of the inlet. Even Fergus, Innes, and Murphy joined in the labor, missing limbs notwithstanding.</p><p>The sun was going down; its disc shone huge and orange-gold, blinding above a sea gone the purple of whelks. The men were no more than black silhouettes against the light, anonymous as the slaves of an Egyptian wall-painting, tethered by ropes to their massive burden.</p><p>The monotonous \u201cHeave!\u201d of the bosun\u2019s shout was succeeded by a weak cheer as the hull slid the last few feet, drawn away from the shore by tow-ropes from the Artemis\u2019s jolly boat and cutter.</p><p>I saw the flash of red hair as Jamie moved up the side and swung aboard, then the gleam of metal as one of the soldiers followed him. They stood guard together, red hair and black no more than dots at the head of the rope ladder, as the crew of the Artemis entered the jolly boat, rowed out and came up the ladder, interspersed with the rest of the French soldiers.</p><p>The last man disappeared up the ladder. The men in the boats sat on their oars, looking up, tense and alert. Nothing happened.</p><p>Next to me, I heard Marsali exhale noisily, and realized I had been holding my own breath much too long.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d she said, in exasperation.</p><p>As though in answer to this, there was one loud, angry shout from the Artemis. The men in the boats jerked up, ready to lunge aboard. No other signal came, though. The Artemis floated serenely on the rising waters of the inlet, perfect as an oil painting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough,\u201d I said suddenly to Marsali. \u201cWhatever those bloody men are doing, they\u2019ve done it. Come on.\u201d</p><p>I drew in a fresh gulp of the cool evening air, and walked out of the trees, Marsali behind me. As we came down the beach, a slim black figure dropped over the ship\u2019s side and galloped through the shallows, gleaming gouts of green and purple seawater spouting from his footsteps.</p><p>\u201cMo chridhe ch\u00e8rie!\u201d Fergus ran dripping toward us, face beaming, and seizing Marsali, swung her off her feet with exuberance and whirled her round.</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d he crowed. \u201cDone without a shot fired! Trussed like geese and packed like salted herrings in the hold!\u201d He kissed Marsali heartily, then set her down on the sand, and turning to me, bowed ceremoniously, with the elaborate flourish of an imaginary hat.</p><p>\u201cMilady, the captain of the Artemis desires you will honor him with your company over supper.\u201d</p><p>The new captain of the Artemis was standing in the middle of his cabin, eyes closed and completely naked, blissfully scratching his testicles.</p><p>\u201cEr,\u201d I said, confronted with this sight. His eyes popped open and his face lit with joy. The next moment, I was enfolded in his embrace, face pressed against the red-gold curls of his chest.</p><p>We didn\u2019t say anything for quite some time. I could hear the thrum of footsteps on the deck overhead, the shouts of the crew, ringing with joy at the imminence of escape, and the creak and flap of sails being rigged. The Artemis was coming back to life around us.</p><p>My face was warm, tingling from the rasp of his beard. I felt suddenly strange and shy holding him, he naked as a jay and myself as bare under the remnants of Father Fogden\u2019s tattered robe.</p><p>The body that pressed against my own with mounting urgency was the same from the neck down, but the face was a stranger\u2019s, a Viking marauder\u2019s. Besides the beard that transformed his face, he smelled unfamiliar, his own sweat overlaid with rancid cooking oil, spilled beer, and the reek of harsh perfume and unfamiliar spices.</p><p>I let go, and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you dress?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t enjoy the scenery,\u201d I added, blushing despite myself. \u201cI\u2014er...I think I like the beard. Maybe,\u201d I added doubtfully, scrutinizing him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said frankly, scratching his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m crawling wi\u2019 lice, and it itches like a fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEew!\u201d While I was entirely familiar with Pediculus humanus, the common body louse, acquaintance had not endeared me. I rubbed a hand nervously through my own hair, already imagining the prickle of feet on my scalp, as tiny sestets gamboled through the thickets of my curls.</p><p>He grinned at me, white teeth startling in the auburn beard.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, Sassenach,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI\u2019ve already sent for a razor and hot water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It seems rather a pity to shave it off right away.\u201d Despite the lice, I leaned forward to peer at his hirsute adornment. \u201cIt\u2019s like your hair, all different colors. Rather pretty, really.\u201d</p><p>I touched it, warily. The hairs were odd; thick and wiry, very curly, in contrast to the soft thick smoothness of the hair on his head. They sprang exuberantly from his skin in a profusion of colors; copper, gold, amber, cinnamon, a roan so deep as almost to be black. Most startling of all was a thick streak of silver that ran from his lower lip to the line of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I said, tracing it. \u201cYou haven\u2019t any white hairs on your head, but you have right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have?\u201d He put a hand to his jaw, looking startled, and I suddenly realized that he likely had no idea what he looked like. Then he smiled wryly, and bent to pick up the pile of discarded clothes from the floor.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, little wonder if I have; I wonder I\u2019ve not gone white-haired altogether from the things I\u2019ve been through this month.\u201d He paused, eyeing me over the wadded white breeches.</p><p>\u201cAnd speaking of that, Sassenach, as I was saying to ye in the trees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, speaking of that,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cWhat in the name of God did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the soldiers, ye mean?\u201d He scratched his chin meditatively. \u201cWell, it was simple enough. I told the soldiers that as soon as the ship was launched, we\u2019d gather everyone on deck, and at my signal, they were to fall on the crew and push them into the hold.\u201d A broad grin blossomed through the foliage. \u201cOnly Fergus had mentioned it to the crew, ye see; so when each soldier came aboard, two of the crewmen snatched him by the arms while a third gagged him, bound his arms, and took away his weapons. Then we pushed all of them into the hold. That\u2019s all.\u201d He shrugged, modestly nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said, exhaling. \u201cAnd as for just how you happened to be here in the first place...\u201d</p><p>At this juncture we were interrupted by a discreet knock on the cabin\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser? Er...Captain, I mean?\u201d Maitland\u2019s angular young face peered round the jamb, cautious over a steaming bowl. \u201cMr. Murphy\u2019s got the galley fire going, and here\u2019s your hot water, with his compliments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMr. Fraser will do,\u201d Jamie assured him, taking the tray with bowl and razor in one hand. \u201cA less seaworthy captain doesna bear thinking of.\u201d He paused, listening to the thump of feet above our heads.</p><p>\u201cThough since I am the captain,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI suppose that means I shall say when we sail and when we stop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, that\u2019s one thing a captain does,\u201d Maitland said. He added helpfully, \u201cThe captain also says when the hands are to have extra rations of food and grog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The upward curl of Jamie\u2019s mouth was still visible, beard notwithstanding. \u201cTell me, Maitland\u2014how much d\u2019ye think the hands can drink and still sail the ship?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, quite a lot, sir,\u201d Maitland said earnestly. His brow wrinkled in thought. \u201cMaybe\u2014an extra double ration all round?\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted one eyebrow. \u201cOf brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sir!\u201d Maitland looked shocked. \u201cGrog. If it was to be brandy, only an extra half-ration, or they\u2019d be rolling in the bilges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble grog, then.\u201d Jamie bowed ceremoniously to Maitland, unhampered by the fact that he was still completely unclad. \u201cMake it so, Mr. Maitland. And the ship will not lift anchor until I have finished my supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Maitland bowed back; Jamie\u2019s manners were catching. \u201cAnd shall I desire the Chinee to attend you directly after the anchor is weighed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomewhat before that, Mr. Maitland, thank ye kindly.\u201d</p><p>Maitland was turning to leave, with a last admiring glance at Jamie\u2019s scars, but I stopped him.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, Maitland,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go down to the galley and ask Mr. Murphy to send up a bottle of his strongest vinegar? And then find where the men have put some of my medicines, and fetch them as well?\u201d</p><p>His narrow forehead creased in puzzlement, but he nodded obligingly. \u201cOh, yes, mum. This directly minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust what d\u2019ye mean to do wi\u2019 the vinegar Sassenach?\u201d Jamie observed me narrowly, as Maitland vanished into the corridor.</p><p>\u201cSouse you in it to kill the lice,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to sleep with a seething nest of vermin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He scratched the side of his neck meditatively. \u201cYe mean to sleep with me, do you?\u201d He glanced at the berth, an uninviting hole in the wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where, precisely, but yes, I do,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cAnd I wish you wouldn\u2019t shave your beard just yet,\u201d I added, as he bent to set down the tray he was holding.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He glanced curiously over his shoulder at me, and I felt the heat rising in my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cEr...well. It\u2019s a bit...different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d He stood up and took a step toward me. In the cramped confines of the cabin, he seemed even bigger\u2014and a lot more naked\u2014than he ever had on deck.</p><p>The dark blue eyes had slanted into triangles of amusement.</p> <p>\u201cHow, different?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, it...um...\u201d I brushed my fingers vaguely past my burning cheeks. \u201cIt feels different. When you kiss me. On my...skin.\u201d</p><p>His eyes locked on mine. He hadn\u2019t moved, but he seemed much closer.</p><p>\u201cYe have verra fine skin, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLike pearls and opals.\u201d He reached out a finger and very gently traced the line of my jaw. And then my neck, and the wide flare of collarbone and back, and down, in a slow-moving serpentine that brushed the tops of my br**sts, hidden in the deep cowl neck of the priest\u2019s robe. \u201cYe have a lot of verra fine skin, Sassenach,\u201d he added. One eyebrow quirked up. \u201cIf that\u2019s what ye were thinking?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and licked my lips, but didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more or less what I was thinking, yes.\u201d</p><p>He took his finger away and glanced at the bowl of steaming water.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It seems a shame to waste the water. Shall I send it back to Murphy to make soup, or shall I drink it?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, both tension and strangeness dissolving at once.</p><p>\u201cYou shall sit down,\u201d I said, \u201cand wash with it. You smell like a brothel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect I do,\u201d he said, scratching. \u201cThere\u2019s one upstairs in the tavern where the soldiers go to drink and gamble.\u201d He took up the soap and dropped it in the hot water.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs, eh?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, the girls come down, betweentimes,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt wouldna be mannerly to stop them sitting on your lap, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother brought you up to have nice manners, I expect,\u201d I said, very dryly.</p><p>\u201cUpon second thoughts, I think perhaps we shall anchor here for the night,\u201d he said thoughtfully, looking at me.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sleep ashore, where there\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom for what?\u201d I asked, regarding him with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have it planned, aye?\u201d he said, sloshing water over his face with both hands.</p><p>\u201cYou have what planned?\u201d I asked. He snorted and shook the excess water from his beard before replying.</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking of this for months, now,\u201d he said, with keen anticipation. \u201cEvery night, folded up in that godforsaken nutshell of a berth, listening to Fergus grunt and fart across the cabin. I thought it all out, just what I would do, did I have ye naked and willing, no one in hearing, and room enough to serve ye suitably.\u201d He lathered the cake of soap vigorously between his palms, and applied it to his face.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m willing enough,\u201d I said, intrigued. \u201cAnd there\u2019s room, certainly. As for naked...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to that,\u201d he assured me. \u201cThat\u2019s part o\u2019 the plan, aye? I shall take ye to a private spot, spread out a quilt to lie on, and commence by sitting down beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a start, all right,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat then?\u201d I sat down next to him on the berth. He leaned close and bit my earlobe very delicately.</p><p>\u201cAs for what next, then I shall take ye on my knee and kiss ye.\u201d He paused to illustrate, holding my arms so I couldn\u2019t move. He let go a minute later, leaving my lips slightly swollen, tasting of ale, soap, and Jamie.</p><p>\u201cSo much for step one,\u201d I said, wiping soapsuds from my mouth. \u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I shall lay ye down upon the quilt, twist your hair up in my hand and taste your face and throat and ears and bosom wi\u2019 my lips,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I would do that until ye start to make squeaking noises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make squeaking noises!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye do,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, hand me the towel, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d he went on cheerfully, \u201cI thought I would begin at the other end. I shall lift up your skirt and\u2014\u201d His face disappeared into the folds of the linen towel.</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d I asked, thoroughly intrigued.</p><p>\u201cAnd kiss the insides of your thighs, where the skin\u2019s so soft. The beard might help there, aye?\u201d He stroked his jaw, considering.</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d I said, a little faintly. \u201cWhat am I supposed to be doing while you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye might moan a bit, if ye like, to encourage me, but otherwise, ye just lie still.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound as though he needed any encouragement whatever. One of his hands was resting on my thigh as he used the other to swab his chest with the damp towel. As he finished, the hand slid behind me, and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cMy beloved\u2019s arm is under me,\u201d I quoted. \u201cAnd his hand behind my head. Comfort me with apples, and stay me with flagons, For I am sick of love.\u201d</p><p>There was a flash of white teeth in his beard.</p><p>\u201cMore like grapefruit,\u201d he said, one hand cupping my behind. \u201cOr possibly gourds. Grapefruit are too small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGourds?\u201d I said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, wild gourds get that big sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut aye, that\u2019s next.\u201d He squeezed once more, then removed the hand in order to wash the armpit on that side. \u201cI lie upon my back and have ye stretched at length upon me, so that I can get hold of your bu**ocks and fondle them properly.\u201d He stopped washing to give me a quick example of what he thought proper, and I let out an involuntary gasp.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he went on, resuming his ablutions, \u201cshould ye wish to kick your legs a bit, or make lewd motions wi\u2019 your hips and pant in my ear at that point in the proceedings, I should have no great objection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not pant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye do. Now, about your br**sts\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I thought you\u2019d forgotten those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever in life,\u201d he assured me. \u201cNo,\u201d he went blithely on, \u201cthat\u2019s when I take off your gown, leaving ye in naught but your shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wearing a shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, no matter,\u201d he said, dismissing this. \u201cI meant to suckle ye through the thin cotton, \u2019til your ni**les stood up hard in my mouth, and then take it off, but it\u2019s no great concern; I\u2019ll manage without. So, allowing for the absence of your shift, I shall attend to your br**sts until ye make that wee bleating noise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, interrupting, \u201csince ye will, according to the plan, be naked, and\u2014provided I\u2019ve done it right so far\u2014possibly willing as well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just possibly,\u201d I said. My lips were still tingling from step one.</p><p>\u201c\u2014then I shall spread open your thighs, take down my breeks, and\u2014\u201d He paused, waiting.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I said, obligingly.</p><p>The grin widened substantially.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what sort of noise it is ye don\u2019t make then, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight cough in the doorway behind me.</p><p>\u201cOh, your pardon, Mr. Willoughby,\u201d Jamie said apologetically. \u201cI wasna expecting ye so soon. Perhaps ye\u2019d care to go and have a bit of supper? And if ye would, take those things along and ask Murphy will he burn them in the galley fire.\u201d He tossed the remains of his uniform to Mr. Willoughby, and bent to rummage in a sealocker for fresh clothing.</p><p>\u201cI never thought to meet Lawrence Stern again,\u201d he remarked, burrowing through the tangled linen. \u201cHow does he come to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he is the Jewish natural philosopher you told me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. Though I shouldna think there are so many Jewish philosophers about as to cause great confusion.\u201d</p><p>I explained how I had come to meet Stern in the mangroves. \u201c...and then he brought me up to the priest\u2019s house,\u201d I said, and stopped, suddenly reminded. \u201cOh, I almost forgot! You owe the priest two pounds sterling, on account of Arabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d Jamie glanced at me, startled, a shirt in his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou do. Maybe you\u2019d best ask Lawrence if he\u2019ll act as ambassador; the priest seems to get on with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right. What\u2019s happened to this Arabella, though? Has one of the crew debauched her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you might say that.\u201d I drew breath to explain further, but before I could speak, another knock sounded on the door.</p><p>\u201cCan a man not dress in peace?\u201d Jamie demanded irritably. \u201cCome, then!\u201d</p><p>The door swung open, revealing Marsali, who blinked at the sight of her nude stepfather. Jamie hastily swathed his midsection in the shirt he was holding, and nodded to her, sangfroid only slightly impaired.</p> <p>\u201cMarsali, lass. I\u2019m glad to see ye unhurt. Did ye require something?\u201d</p><p>The girl edged into the room, taking up a position between the table and a sea chest.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d she said. She was sunburned, and her nose was peeling, but I thought she seemed pale nonetheless. Her fists were clenched at her sides, and her chin lifted as for battle.</p><p>\u201cI require ye to keep your promise,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie looked wary.</p> <p>\u201cYour promise to let me and Fergus be married, so soon as we came to the Indies.\u201d A small wrinkle appeared between her fair eyebrows. \u201cHispaniola is in the Indies, no? The Jew said so.\u201d</p><p>Jamie scratched at his beard, looking reluctant.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd aye, I suppose if I...well, aye. I did promise. But\u2014you\u2019re still sure of yourselves, the two of ye?\u201d She lifted her chin higher, jaw set firmly.</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fergus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelping stow the cargo. I kent we\u2019d be under way soon, so I thought I\u2019d best come and ask now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Well.\u201d Jamie frowned, then sighed with resignation. \u201cAye, I said. But I did say as ye must be blessed by a priest, did I no? There\u2019s no priest closer than Bayamo, and that\u2019s three days\u2019 ride. But perhaps in Jamaica...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, you\u2019re forgetting!\u201d Marsali said triumphantly. \u201cWe\u2019ve a priest right here. Father Fogden can marry us.\u201d</p><p>I felt my jaw drop, and hastily closed it. Jamie was scowling at her.</p><p>\u201cWe sail first thing in the morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a few words, after all. We\u2019re already married, by law; it\u2019s only to be blessed by the Church, aye?\u201d Her hand flattened on her abdomen where her marriage contract presumably resided beneath her stays.</p><p>\u201cBut your mother...\u201d Jamie glanced helplessly at me for reinforcement. I shrugged, equally helpless. The task of trying either to explain Father Fogden to Jamie or to dissuade Marsali was well beyond me.</p><p>\u201cHe likely won\u2019t do it, though.\u201d Jamie came up with this objection with a palpable air of relief. \u201cThe crew have been trifling with one of his parishioners named Arabella. He willna want anything to do wi\u2019 us, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he will! He\u2019ll do it for me\u2014he likes me!\u201d Marsali was almost dancing on her toes with eagerness.</p><p>Jamie looked at her for a long moment, eyes fixed on hers, reading her face. She was very young.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure, then, lassie?\u201d he said at last, very gently. \u201cYe want this?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath, a glow spreading over her face.</p><p>\u201cI am, Da. I truly am. I want Fergus! I love him!\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated a moment, then rubbed a hand through his hair and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, then. Go and send Mr. Stern to me, then fetch Fergus and tell him to make ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Da! Thank you, thank you!\u201d Marsali flung herself at him and kissed him. He held her with one arm, clutching the shirt about his middle with the other. Then he kissed her on the forehead and pushed her gently away.</p><p>\u201cTake care,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cYe dinna want to go to your bridal covered wi\u2019 lice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d This seemed to remind her of something. She glanced at me and blushed, putting up a hand to her own pale locks, which were matted with sweat and straggling down her neck from a careless knot.</p><p>\u201cMother Claire,\u201d she said shyly, \u201cI wonder\u2014would ye\u2014could ye lend me a bit of the special soap ye make wi\u2019 the chamomile? I\u2014if there\u2019s time\u2014\u201d she added, with a hasty glance at Jamie, \u201cI should like to wash my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, and smiled at her. \u201cCome along and we\u2019ll make you pretty for your wedding.\u201d I looked her over appraisingly, from glowing round face to dirty bare feet. The crumpled muslin of her sea-shrunk gown stretched tight over her bosom, slight as it was, and the grubby hem hovered several inches above her sandy ankles.</p><p>A thought struck me, and I turned to Jamie. \u201cShe should have a nice dress to be married in,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said, with obviously waning patience, \u201cwe havena\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the priest does,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cTell Lawrence to ask Father Fogden whether we might borrow one of his gowns; Ermenegilda\u2019s, I mean. I think they\u2019re almost the right size.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face went blank with surprise above his beard.</p><p>\u201cErmenegilda?\u201d he said. \u201cArabella? Gowns?\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cWhat sort of priest is this man, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I paused in the doorway, Marsali hovering impatiently in the passage beyond.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201che drinks a bit. And he\u2019s rather fond of sheep. But he might remember the words to the wedding ceremony.\u201d</p><p>It was one of the more unusual weddings I had attended. The sun had long since sunk into the sea by the time all arrangements were made. To the disgruntlement of Mr. Warren, the ship\u2019s master, Jamie had declared that we would not leave until the next day, so as to allow the newlyweds one night of privacy ashore.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I\u2019d care to consummate a marriage in one of those godforsaken pesthole berths,\u201d he told me privately. \u201cIf they got coupled in there to start wi\u2019, we\u2019d never pry them out. And the thought of takin\u2019 a maidenhead in a hammock\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d I said. I poured more vinegar on his head, smiling to myself. \u201cVery thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>Now Jamie stood by me on the beach, smelling rather strongly of vinegar, but handsome and dignified in blue coat, clean stock and linen, and gray serge breeks, with his hair clubbed back and ribboned. The wild red beard was a bit incongruous above his otherwise sober garb, but it had been neatly trimmed and fine-combed with vinegar, and stockinged feet notwithstanding, he made a fine picture as father of the bride.</p><p>Murphy, as one chief witness, and Maitland, as the other, were somewhat less prepossessing, though Murphy had washed his hands and Maitland his face. Fergus would have preferred Lawrence Stern as a witness, and Marsali had asked for me, but both were dissuaded; first on grounds that Stern was not a Christian, let alone a Catholic, and then, by consideration that while I was religiously qualified, that fact was unlikely to weigh heavily with Laoghaire, once she found out about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told Marsali she must write to her mother to say she\u2019s wed,\u201d Jamie murmured to me as we watched the preparations on the beach go forward. \u201cBut perhaps I shall suggest she doesna say much more about it than that.\u201d</p><p>I saw his point; Laoghaire was not going to be pleased at hearing that her eldest daughter had eloped with a one-handed ex-pickpocket twice her age. Her maternal feelings were unlikely to be assuaged by hearing that the marriage had been performed in the middle of the night on a West Indian beach by a disgraced\u2014if not actually defrocked\u2014priest, witnessed by twenty-five seamen, ten French horses, a small flock of sheep\u2014all gaily beribboned in honor of the occasion\u2014and a King Charles spaniel, who added to the generally festive feeling by attempting to copulate with Murphy\u2019s wooden leg at every opportunity. The only thing that could make things worse, in Laoghaire\u2019s view, would be to hear that I had participated in the ceremony.</p><p>Several torches were lit, bound to stakes pounded into the sand, and the flames streamed seaward in tails of red and orange, bright against the black velvet night. The brilliant stars of the Caribbean shone overhead like the lights of heaven. While it was not a church, few brides had had a more beautiful setting for their nuptials.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what prodigies of persuasion had been required on Lawrence\u2019s part, but Father Fogden was there, frail and insubstantial as a ghost, the blue sparks of his eyes the only real signs of life. His skin was gray as his robe, and his hands trembled on the worn leather of his prayer book.</p><p>Jamie glanced sharply at him, and appeared to be about to say something, but then merely muttered under his breath in Gaelic and pressed his lips tightly together. The spicy scent of sangria wafted from Father Fogden\u2019s vicinity, but at least he had reached the beach under his own power. He stood swaying between two torches, laboriously trying to turn the pages of his book as the light offshore wind jerked them fluttering from his fingers.</p><p>At last he gave up, and dropped the book on the sand with a little plop!</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d he said, and belched. He looked about and gave us a small, saint-like smile. \u201cDearly beloved of God.\u201d</p><p>It was several moments before the throng of shuffling, murmuring spectators realized that the ceremony had started, and began to poke each other and straighten to attention.</p><p>\u201cWilt thou take this woman?\u201d Father Fogden demanded, suddenly rounding ferociously on Murphy.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d said the cook, startled. \u201cI don\u2019t hold wi\u2019 women. Messy things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d Father Fogden closed one eye, the remaining orb bright and accusing. He looked at Maitland.</p><p>\u201cDo you take this woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, sir, no. Not that anyone wouldn\u2019t be pleased,\u201d he added hastily. \u201cHim, please.\u201d Maitland pointed at Fergus, who stood next to the cabin boy, glowering at the priest.</p><p>\u201cHim? You\u2019re sure? He hasn\u2019t a hand,\u201d Father Fogden said doubtfully. \u201cWon\u2019t she mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not!\u201d Marsali, imperious in one of Ermenegilda\u2019s gowns, blue silk encrusted with gold embroidery along the low, square neckline and puffed sleeves, stood beside Fergus. She looked lovely, with her hair clean and bright as fresh straw, brushed to a gloss and floating loose round her shoulders, as became a maiden. She also looked angry.</p><p>\u201cGo on!\u201d She stamped her foot, which made no noise on the sand, but seemed to startle the priest.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said nervously, taking one step back. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s an impt\u2014impeddy\u2014impediment, after all. Not as though he\u2019d lost his cock, I mean. He hasn\u2019t, has he?\u201d the priest inquired anxiously, as the possibility occurred to him. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you if he has. It\u2019s not allowed.\u201d</p><p>Marsali\u2019s face was already bathed in red by torchlight. The expression on it at this point reminded me strongly of how her mother had looked upon finding me at Lallybroch. A visible tremor ran through Fergus\u2019s shoulders, whether of rage or laughter, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Jamie quelled the incipient riot by striding firmly into the middle of the wedding and placing a hand on the shoulders of Fergus and Marsali. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis man,\u201d he said, with a nod toward Fergus, \u201cand this woman,\u201d with another toward Marsali. \u201cMarry them, Father. Now. Please,\u201d he added, as an obvious afterthought, and stood back a pace, restoring order among the audience by dint of dark glances from side to side.</p><p>\u201cOh, quite. Quite,\u201d Father Fogden repeated, swaying gently. \u201cQuite, quite.\u201d A long pause followed, during which the priest squinted at Marsali.</p><p>\u201cName,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI have to have a name. Can\u2019t get married without a name. Just like a cock. Can\u2019t get married without a name; can\u2019t get married without a c\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsali Jane MacKimmie Joyce!\u201d Marsali spoke up loudly, drowning him out.</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cOf course it is. Marsali. Mar-sa-lee. Just so. Well, then, do you Mar-sa-lee take this man\u2014even though he\u2019s missing a hand and possibly other parts not visible\u2014to be your lawful husband? To have and to hold, from this day forward, forsaking...\u201d At this point he trailed off, his attention fixed on one of the sheep that had wandered into the light and was chewing industriously on a discarded stocking of striped wool.</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>Father Fogden blinked, brought back to attention. He made an unsuccessful attempt to stifle another belch, and transferred his bright blue gaze to Fergus.</p><p>\u201cYou have a name, too? And a cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Fergus, wisely choosing not to be more specific. \u201cFergus.\u201d</p> <p>The priest frowned slightly at this. \u201cFergus?\u201d he said. \u201cFergus. Fergus. Yes, Fergus, got that. That\u2019s all? No more name? Need more names, surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus,\u201d Fergus repeated, with a note of strain in his voice. Fergus was the only name he had ever had\u2014bar his original French name of Claudel. Jamie had given him the name Fergus in Paris, when they had met, twenty years before. But naturally a brothel-born bastard would have no last name to give a wife.</p><p>\u201cFraser,\u201d said a deep, sure voice beside me. Fergus and Marsali both glanced back in surprise, and Jamie nodded. His eyes met Fergus\u2019s, and he smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cFergus Claudel Fraser,\u201d he said, slowly and clearly. One eyebrow lifted as he looked at Fergus.</p><p>Fergus himself looked transfixed. His mouth hung open, eyes wide black pools in the dim light. Then he nodded slightly, and a glow rose in his face, as though he contained a candle that had just been lit.</p><p>\u201cFraser,\u201d he said to the priest. His voice was husky, and he cleared his throat. \u201cFergus Claudel Fraser.\u201d</p> <p>Father Fogden had his head tilted back, watching the sky, where a crescent of light floated over the trees, holding the black orb of the moon in its cup. He lowered his head to face Fergus, looking dreamy.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>A small poke in the ribs from Maitland brought him back to an awareness of his responsibilities.</p><p>\u201cOh! Um. Well. Man and wife. Yes, I pronounce you man\u2014no, that\u2019s not right, you haven\u2019t said whether you\u2019d take her. She has both hands,\u201d he added helpfully.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Fergus said. He had been holding Marsali\u2019s hand; now he let go and dug hastily in his pocket, coming out with a small gold ring. He must have bought it in Scotland, I realized, and kept it ever since, not wanting to make the marriage official until it had been blessed. Not by a priest\u2014by Jamie.</p><p>The beach was silent as he slid the ring on her finger, all eyes fixed on the small gold circle and the two heads bent close together over it, one bright, one dark.</p><p>So she had done it. One fifteen-year-old girl, with nothing but stubbornness as a weapon. \u201cI want him,\u201d she had said. And kept saying it, through her mother\u2019s objections and Jamie\u2019s arguments, through Fergus\u2019s scruples and her own fears, through three thousand miles of homesickness, hardship, ocean storm, and shipwreck.</p><p>She raised her face, shining, and found her mirror in Fergus\u2019s eyes. I saw them look at each other, and felt the tears prickle behind my lids.</p> <p>\u201cI want him.\u201d I had not said that to Jamie at our marriage; I had not wanted him, then. But I had said it since, three times; in two moments of choice at Craigh na Dun, and once again at Lallybroch.</p><p>\u201cI want him.\u201d I wanted him still, and nothing whatever could stand between us.</p><p>He was looking down at me; I could feel the weight of his gaze, dark blue and tender as the sea at dawn.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye thinking, mo chridhe?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>I blinked back the tears and smiled at him. His hands were large and warm on mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat I tell you three times is true,\u201d I said. And standing on tiptoe, I kissed him as the sailor\u2019s cheer went up.</p><p>PART NINE</p><p>Worlds Unknown</p><p>53</p><p>BAT GUANO</p><p>Bat guano is a slimy blackish green when fresh, a powdery light brown when dried. In both states, it emits an eye-watering reek of musk, ammonia, and decay.</p><p>\u201cHow much of this stuff did you say we\u2019re taking?\u201d I asked, through the cloth I had wrapped about my lower face.</p><p>\u201cTen tons,\u201d Jamie replied, his words similarly muffled. We were standing on the upper deck, watching as the slaves trundled barrowloads of the reeking stuff down the gangplank and over to the open hatchway of the after hold.</p><p>Tiny particles of the dried guano blew from the barrows and filled the air around us with a deceptively beautiful cloud of gold, that sparked and glimmered in the late afternoon sun. The men\u2019s bodies were coated with the stuff as well; the runnels of sweat carved dark channels in the dust on their bare torsos, and the constant tears ran down their faces and chests, so that they were striped in black and gold like exotic zebras.</p><p>Jamie dabbed at his own streaming eyes as the wind veered slightly toward us. \u201cD\u2019ye ken how to keelhaul someone, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if it\u2019s Fergus you have in mind as a candidate, I\u2019m with you. How far is it to Jamaica?\u201d It was Fergus, making inquiries in the marketplace on King\u2019s Street in Bridgetown, who had gained the Artemis her first commission as a trading and hauling vessel; the shipment of ten cubic tons of bat guano from Barbados to Jamaica, for use as fertilizer on the sugar plantation of one Mr. Grey, planter.</p><p>Fergus himself was rather self-consciously overseeing the loading of the huge quarried blocks of dried guano, which were tipped from their barrows and handed down one by one into the hold. Marsali, never far from his side, had in this case moved as far as the forecastle, where she sat on a barrel filled with oranges, the lovely new shawl Fergus had bought her in the market wrapped over her face.</p><p>\u201cWe are meant to be traders, no?\u201d Fergus had argued. \u201cWe have an empty hold to fill. Besides,\u201d he had added logically, clinching the argument, \u201cMonsieur Grey will pay us more than adequately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie squinted at the horizon, as though hoping to see land rising from the sparkling waves. Mr. Willoughby\u2019s magic needles rendered him seaworthy, but he submitted to the process with no real enthusiasm. \u201cThree or four days\u2019 sail, Warren says,\u201d he admitted with a sigh, \u201cand the weather holds fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the smell will be better at sea,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, milady,\u201d Fergus assured me, overhearing as he passed. \u201cThe owner tells me that the stench dissipates itself significantly, once the dried material is removed from the caves where it accumulates.\u201d He leapt into the rigging and went up, climbing like a monkey despite his hook. Reaching the top rigging, Fergus tied the red kerchief that was the signal to hands on shore to come aboard, and slid down again, pausing to say something rude to Ping An, who was perched on the lowest crosstrees, keeping a bright yellow eye on the proceedings below.</p><p>\u201cFergus seems to be taking quite a proprietary interest in this cargo,\u201d I observed.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, he\u2019s a partner,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI told him if he\u2019d a wife to support, he must think of how to do it. And as it may be some time before we\u2019re in the printing business again, he must turn his hand to what offers. He and Marsali have half the profit on this cargo\u2014against the dowry I promised her,\u201d he added wryly, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cI really would like to read the letter Marsali\u2019s sending to her mother. First Fergus, I mean, then Father Fogden and Mamacita, and now a dowry of ten tons of bat shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall never be able to set foot in Scotland again, once Laoghaire reads it,\u201d said Jamie, but he smiled nonetheless. \u201cHave ye thought yet what to do wi\u2019 your new acquisition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d I said, a little grimly. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere below,\u201d Jamie said, his attention distracted by a man coming down the wharf toward us. \u201cMurphy\u2019s fed him, and Innes will find a place for him. Your pardon, Sassenach; I think this will be someone looking for me.\u201d He swung down from the rail and went down the gangplank, neatly skipping around a slave coming up with a barrowload of guano.</p><p>I watched with interest as he greeted the man, a tall colonial in the dress of a prosperous planter, with a weathered red face that spoke of long years in the islands. He extended a hand toward Jamie, who took it in a firm clasp. Jamie said something, and the man replied, his expression of wariness changing to an instant cordiality.</p><p>This must be the result of Jamie\u2019s visit to the Masonic lodge in Bridgetown, where he had gone immediately upon landing the day before, mindful of Jared\u2019s suggestion. He had identified himself as a member of the brotherhood, and spoken to the Master of the lodge, describing Young Ian and asking for any news of either the boy or the ship Bruja. The Master had promised to spread the word among such Freemasons as might have occasion to frequent the slave market and the shipping docks. With luck, this was the fruit of that promise.</p><p>I watched eagerly as the planter reached into his coat and withdrew a paper, which he unfolded and showed to Jamie, apparently explaining something. Jamie\u2019s face was intent, his ruddy brows drawn together with concentration, but showed neither exultation nor disappointment. Maybe it was not news of Ian at all. After our visit to the slave market the day before, I was half-inclined to hope not.</p><p>Lawrence, Fergus, Marsali, and I had gone to the slave market under the cranky chaperonage of Murphy, while Jamie called on the Masonic Master. The slave market was near the docks, down a dusty road lined with sellers of fruit and coffee, dried fish and coconuts, yams and red cochineal bugs, sold for dye in small, corked glass bottles.</p><p>Murphy, with his passion for order and propriety, had insisted that Marsali and I must each have a parasol, and had forced Fergus to buy two from a roadside vendor.</p><p>\u201cAll the white women in Bridgetown carry parasols,\u201d he said firmly, trying to hand me one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a parasol,\u201d I said, impatient at talk of something so inconsequential as my complexion, when we might be near to finding Ian at last. \u201cThe sun isn\u2019t that hot. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Murphy glowered at me, scandalized.</p><p>\u201cYe don\u2019t want folk to think ye ain\u2019t respectable, that ye don\u2019t care enough to keep yer skin fine!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to take up residence here,\u201d I said tartly. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they think.\u201d Not pausing to argue further, I began walking down the road, toward a distant murmur of noise that I took to be the slave market.</p><p>\u201cYer face will...get...red!\u201d Murphy said, huffing indignantly alongside me, attempting to open the parasol as he stumped along.</p><p>\u201cOh, a fate worse than death, I\u2019m sure!\u201d I snapped. My nerves were strung tight, in anticipation of what we might find. \u201cAll right, then, give me the bloody thing!\u201d I snatched it from him, snapped it open, and set it over my shoulder with an irritable twirl.</p><p>As it was, within minutes I was grateful for Murphy\u2019s intransigence. While the road was shaded by tall palms and cecropia trees, the slave market itself was held in a large, stone-paved space without the grace of any shade, save that provided by ramshackle open booths roofed with sheets of tin or palm fronds, in which the slave-dealers and auctioneers sought occasional refuge from the sun. The slaves themselves were mostly held in large pens at the side of the square, open to the elements.</p> <p>The sun was fierce in the open, and the light bouncing off the pale stones was blinding after the green shade of the road. I blinked, eyes watering, and hastily adjusted my parasol over my head.</p><p>So shaded, I could see a bewildering array of bodies, naked or nearly so, gleaming in every shade from pale caf\u00e9 au lait to a deep blue-black. Bouquets of color blossomed in front of the auction blocks, where the plantation owners and their servants gathered to inspect the wares, vivid amid the stark blacks and whites.</p><p>The stink of the place was staggering, even to one accustomed to the stenches of Edinburgh and the reeking tween-decks of the Porpoise. Heaps of wet human excrement lay in the corners of the slave pens, buzzing with flies, and a thick oily reek floated on the air, but the major component of the smell was the unpleasantly intimate scent of acres of hot bare flesh, baking in the sun.</p><p>\u201cJesu,\u201d Fergus muttered next to me. His dark eyes flicked right and left in shocked disapproval. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than the slums in Montmartre.\u201d Marsali didn\u2019t say a word, but drew closer to his side, her nostrils pinched.</p><p>Lawrence was more matter-of-fact; I supposed he must have seen slave markets before during his explorations of the islands.</p> <p>\u201cThe whites are at that end,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the far side of the square. \u201cCome; we\u2019ll ask for news of any young men sold recently.\u201d He placed a large square hand in the center of my back and urged me gently forward through the crowd.</p><p>Near the edge of the market, an old black woman squatted on the ground, feeding charcoal to a small brazier. As we drew near, a little group of people approached her: a planter, accompanied by two black men dressed in rough cotton shirts and trousers, evidently his servants. One of them was holding the arm of a newly purchased female slave; two other girls, naked but for small strips of cloth wrapped about their middles, were led by ropes around their necks.</p><p>The planter bent and handed the old woman a coin. She turned and drew several short brass rods from the ground behind her, holding them up for the man\u2019s inspection. He studied them for a moment, picked out two, and straightened up. He handed the branding irons to one of his servants, who thrust the ends into the old woman\u2019s brazier.</p><p>The other servant stepped behind the girl and pinioned her arms. The first man then pulled the irons from the fire and planted both together on the upper slope of her right breast. She shrieked, a high steam-whistle sound loud enough to turn a few heads nearby. The irons pulled away, leaving the letters HB in raw pink flesh.</p><p>I had stopped dead at the sight of this. Not realizing that I was no longer with them, the others had gone on. I turned round and round, looking vainly for any trace of Lawrence or Fergus. I never had any difficulty finding Jamie in crowds; his bright head was always visible above everyone else\u2019s. But Fergus was a small man, Murphy, no taller, and Lawrence, no more than middle height; even Marsali\u2019s yellow parasol was lost among the many others in the square.</p><p>I turned away from the brazier with a shudder, hearing screams and whimpers behind me, but not wanting to look back. I hurried past several auction blocks, eyes averted, but then was slowed and finally stopped by a thickening of the crowd around me.</p> <p>The men and women blocking my way were listening to an auctioneer who was touting the virtues of a one-armed slave who stood naked on the block for inspection. He was a short man, but broadly built, with massive thighs and a strong chest. The missing arm had been crudely amputated above the elbow; sweat dripped from the end of the stump.</p><p>\u201cNo good for field work, that\u2019s true,\u201d the auctioneer was admitting. \u201cBut a sound investment for breeding. Look at those legs!\u201d He carried a long rattan cane, which he flicked against the slave\u2019s calves, then grinned fatly at the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWill you give a guarantee of virility?\u201d the man standing behind me said, with a distinct tone of skepticism. \u201cI had a buck three year past, big as a mule, and not a foal dropped on his account; couldn\u2019t do a thing, the juba-girls said.\u201d</p><p>The crowd tittered at that, and the auctioneer pretended to be offended.</p><p>\u201cGuarantee?\u201d he said. He wiped a hand theatrically over his jowls, gathering oily sweat on the palm. \u201cSee for yourselves, O ye of little faith!\u201d Bending slightly, he grasped the slave\u2019s penis and began to massage it vigorously.</p><p>The man grunted in surprise and tried to draw back, but was prevented by the auctioneer\u2019s assistant, who clutched him firmly by his single arm. There was an outburst of laughter from the crowd, and a few scattered cheers as the soft black flesh hardened and began to swell.</p><p>Some small thing inside me suddenly snapped; I heard it, distinctly. Outraged by the market, the branding, the nakedness, the crude talk and casual indignity, outraged most of all by my own presence here, I could not even think what I was doing, but began to do it, all the same. I felt very oddly detached, as though I stood outside myself, watching.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I said, very loudly, hardly recognizing my own voice. The auctioneer looked up, startled, and smiled ingratiatingly at me. He looked directly into my eyes, with a knowing leer.</p> <p>\u201cSound breeding stock, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cGuaranteed, as you see.\u201d</p><p>I folded my parasol, lowered it, and stabbed the pointed end of it as hard as I could into his fat stomach. He jerked back, eyes bulging in surprise. I yanked the parasol back and smashed it on his head, then dropped it and kicked him, hard.</p><p>Somewhere deep inside, I knew it would make no difference, would not help in any way, would do nothing but harm. And yet I could not stand here, consenting by silence. It was not for the branded girls, the man on the block, not for any of them that I did it; it was for myself.</p><p>There was a good deal of noise around me, and hands snatched at me, pulling me off the auctioneer. This worthy, recovered sufficiently from his initial shock, grinned nastily at me, took aim, and slapped the slave hard across the face.</p><p>I looked around for reinforcements, and caught a quick glimpse of Fergus, face contorted in rage, lunging through the crowd toward the auctioneer. There was a shout, and several men turned in his direction. People began to push and shove. Someone tripped me and I sat down hard on the stones.</p><p>Through a haze of dust, I saw Murphy, six feet away. With a resigned expression on his broad red face, he bent, detached his wooden leg, straightened up, and hopping gracefully forward, brought it down with great force on the auctioneer\u2019s head. The man tottered and fell, as the crowd surged back, trying to get out of the way.</p><p>Fergus, baffled of his prey, skidded to a halt by the fallen man and glared ferociously round. Lawrence, dark, grim, and bulky, came striding through the crowd from the other direction, hand on the cane-knife at his belt.</p><p>I sat on the ground, shaken. I no longer felt detached. I felt sick, and terrified, realizing that I had just committed an act of folly that was likely to result in Fergus, Lawrence, and Murphy being badly beaten, if nothing worse.</p><p>And then Jamie was there.</p><p>\u201cStand up, Sassenach,\u201d he said quietly, stooping over me and giving me his hands. I managed it, knees shaking. I saw Raeburn\u2019s long mustache twitching at one side, MacLeod behind him, and realized that his Scots were with him. Then my knees gave way, but Jamie\u2019s arms held me up.</p><p>\u201cDo something,\u201d I said in a choked voice into his chest. \u201cPlease. Do something.\u201d</p><p>He had. With his usual presence of mind, he had done the only thing that would quell the riot and prevent harm. He had bought the one-armed man. And as the ironic result of my little outburst of sensibilities, I was now the appalled owner of a genuine male Guinea slave, one-armed, but in glowing health and of guaranteed virility.</p><p>I sighed, trying not to think of the man, presumably now somewhere under my feet, fed, and\u2014I hoped\u2014clad. The papers of ownership, which I had refused even to touch, said that he was a full-blooded Gold Coast Negro, a Yoruba, sold by a French planter from Barbuda, one-armed, bearing a brand on the left shoulder of a fleur-de-lys and the initial \u201cA,\u201d and known by the name Temeraire. The Bold One. The papers did not suggest what in the name of God I was to do with him.</p><p>Jamie had finished looking at the papers his Masonic acquaintance had brought\u2014they were very like the ones I had received for Temeraire, so far as I could see from the rail of the ship. He handed them back with a bow of thanks, a slight frown on his face. The men exchanged a few more words, and parted with another handshake.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone aboard?\u201d Jamie asked, stepping off the gangplank. There was a light breeze; it fluttered the dark blue ribbon that tied back the thick tail of his hair.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d said Mr. Warren, with the casual jerk of the head that passed for a salute in a merchant ship. \u201cShall we make sail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall, if ye please. Thank ye, Mr. Warren.\u201d With a small bow, Jamie passed him and came to stand beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. His face was calm, but I could feel the depths of his disappointment. Interviews the day before with the two men who dealt in white indentured labor at the slave market had provided no useful information\u2014the Masonic planter had been a beacon of last-minute hope.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything helpful to be said. I put my hand over his where it lay on the rail, and squeezed lightly. Jamie looked down and gave me a faint smile. He took a deep breath and straightened his shoulders, shrugging to settle his coat over them.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. I\u2019ve learned something, at least. That was a Mr. Villiers, who owns a large sugar plantation here. He bought six slaves from the captain of the ship Bruja, three days ago\u2014but none of them Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days?\u201d I was startled. \u201cBut\u2014the Bruja left Hispaniola more than two weeks ago!\u201d</p><p>He nodded, rubbing his cheek. He had shaved, a necessity before making public inquiries, and his skin glowed fresh and ruddy above the snowy linen of his stock.</p><p>\u201cShe did. And she arrived here on Wednesday\u2014five days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019d been somewhere else, before coming to Barbados! Do we know where?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVilliers didna ken. He said he had spoken some time wi\u2019 the captain of the Bruja, and the man seemed verra secretive about where he\u2019d been and what he\u2019d been doing. Villiers thought no great thing of it, knowin\u2019 as the Bruja has a reputation as a crook ship\u2014and seein\u2019 as how the captain was willing to sell the slaves for a good price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\u201d\u2014he brightened slightly\u2014\u201cVilliers did show me the papers for the slaves he\u2019d bought. Ye\u2019ll have seen those for your slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t call him that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut yes. Were the ones you saw the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. Three o\u2019 the papers gave no previous owner\u2014though Villiers says they were none of them fresh from Africa; all of them have a few words of English, at least. One listed a previous owner, but the name had been scratched out; I couldna read it. The other two gave a Mrs. Abernathy of Rose Hall, Jamaica, as the previous owner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJamaica? How far\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cBut Mr. Warren will know. It may be right. In any case, I think we must go to Jamaica next\u2014if only to dispose of our cargo before we all die o\u2019 disgust.\u201d He wrinkled his long nose fastidiously and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou look like an anteater when you do that,\u201d I told him.</p><p>The attempt to distract him was successful; the wide mouth curved upward slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? There\u2019s a beastie eats ants, is there?\u201d He did his best to respond to the teasing, turning his back on the Barbados docks. He leaned against the rail and smiled down at me. \u201cI shouldna think they\u2019d be verra filling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose it must eat a lot of them. They can\u2019t be any worse than haggis, after all.\u201d I took a breath before going on, and let it out quickly, coughing. \u201cGod, what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>The Artemis had by now slid free of the loading wharf and out into the harbor. As we came about into the wind, a deep, pungent smell struck the ship, a lower and more sinister note in the olfactory dockside symphony of dead barnacles, wet wood, fish, rotted seaweed, and the constant warm breath of the tropical vegetation on shore.</p><p>I pressed my handkerchief hard over my nose and mouth. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re passing the burning ground, mum, at the foot o\u2019 the slave market,\u201d Maitland explained, overhearing my question. He pointed toward the shore, where a plume of white smoke rose from behind a screen of bayberry bushes. \u201cThey burn the bodies of the slaves who don\u2019t survive their passage from Africa,\u201d he explained. \u201cFirst they unload the living cargo, and then, as the ship is swabbed out, the bodies are removed and thrown onto the pyre here, to prevent sickness spreading into the town.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jamie, and found the same fear in his face that showed in my own.</p><p>\u201cHow often do they burn bodies?\u201d I asked. \u201cEvery day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, mum, but I don\u2019t think so. Maybe once a week?\u201d Maitland shrugged and went on about his duties.</p><p>\u201cWe have to look,\u201d I said. My voice sounded strange to my own ears, calm and clear. I didn\u2019t feel that way.</p><p>Jamie had gone very pale. He had turned round again, and his eyes were fixed on the plume of smoke, rising thick and white from behind the palm trees.</p><p>His lips pressed tight, then, and his jaw set hard.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d was all he said, and turned to tell Mr. Warren to put about.</p><p>The keeper of the flames, a wizened little creature of indistinguishable color and accent, was vociferously shocked at the notion that a lady should enter the burning ground, but Jamie elbowed him brusquely aside. He didn\u2019t try to prevent me following him, or turn to see that I did; he knew I would not leave him alone here.</p><p>It was a small hollow, set behind a screen of trees, convenient to a small wharf that extended into the river. Black-smeared pitch barrels and piles of dry wood stood in grim sticky clumps amid the brilliant greens of tree-ferns and dwarf poinciana. To the right, a huge pyre had been built, with a platform of wood, onto which the bodies had been thrown, dribbled with pitch.</p><p>This had been lit only a short time before; a good blaze had started at one side of the heap, but only small tongues of flame licked up from the rest. It was smoke that obscured the bodies, rolling up over the heap in a wavering thick veil that gave the outflung limbs a horrid illusion of movement.</p> <p>Jamie had stopped, staring at the heap. Then he sprang onto the platform, heedless of smoke and scorching, and began jerking bodies loose, grimly pawing through the grisly remains.</p><p>A smaller heap of gray ashes and shards of pure white friable bone lay nearby. The curve of an occiput lay on top of the heap, fragile and perfect as an eggshell.</p><p>\u201cMakee fine crop.\u201d The soot-smeared little creature who tended the fire was at my elbow, offering information in evident hopes of reward. He\u2014or she\u2014pointed at the ashes. \u201cPut on crop; makee grow-grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I said faintly. The smoke obscured Jamie\u2019s figure for a moment, and I had the terrible feeling that he had fallen, was burning in the pyre. The horrible, jolly smell of roasting meat rose on the air, and I thought I would be sick.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I called. \u201cJamie!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but I heard a deep, racking cough from the heart of the fire. Several long minutes later, the veil of smoke parted, and he staggered out, choking.</p><p>He made his way down the platform and stood bent over, coughing his lungs out. He was covered with an oily soot, his hands and clothes smeared with pitch. He was blind with the smoke; tears poured down his cheeks, making runnels in the soot.</p><p>I threw several coins to the keeper of the pyre, and taking Jamie by the arm, led him, blind and choking, out of the valley of death. Under the palms, he sank to his knees and threw up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he gasped, when I tried to help him. He retched over and over again, but finally stopped, swaying on his knees. Then he slowly staggered to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he said again. His voice, roughened by smoke and sickness, was that of a stranger.</p><p>He walked to the edge of the dock, removed his coat and shoes, and dived into the water, fully clothed. I waited for a moment, then stooped and picked up the coat and shoes, holding them gingerly at arm\u2019s length. I could see in the inner pocket the faint rectangular bulge of Brianna\u2019s pictures.</p><p>I waited until he came back and hoisted himself out of the water, dripping. The pitch smears were still there, but most of the soot and the smell of the fire were gone. He sat on the wharf, head on his knees, breathing hard. A row of curious faces edged the Artemis\u2019s rail above us.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, I leaned down and laid a hand on his shoulder. Without raising his head, he reached up a hand and grasped mine.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said, in his muffled, rasping stranger\u2019s voice.</p><p>The breeze was freshening; it stirred the tendrils of wet hair that lay across his shoulders. I looked back, to see that the plume of smoke rising from the little valley had changed to black. It flattened and began to drift out over the sea, the ashes of the dead slaves fleeing on the wind, back toward Africa.</p><p>54</p><p>\u201cTHE IMPETUOUS PIRATE\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t own anyone, Jamie,\u201d I said, looking in dismay at the papers spread out in the lamplight before me. \u201cI just can\u2019t. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m inclined to agree wi\u2019 ye, Sassenach. But what are we to do with the fellow?\u201d Jamie sat on the berth next to me, close enough to see the ownership documents over my shoulder. He rubbed a hand through his hair frowning.</p><p>\u201cWe could set him free\u2014that would seem the right thing\u2014and yet, if we do\u2014what will happen to him then?\u201d He hunched forward, squinting down his nose to read the papers. \u201cHe\u2019s no more than a bit of French and English; no skills to speak of. If we were to set him free, or even give him a bit of money\u2014can he manage to live, on his own?\u201d</p><p>I nibbled thoughtfully on one of Murphy\u2019s cheese rolls. It was good, but the smell of the burning oil in the lamp blended oddly with the aromatic cheese, underlaid\u2014as everything was\u2014with the insidious scent of bat guano that permeated the ship.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cLawrence told me there are a lot of free blacks on Hispaniola. Lots of Creoles and mixed-race people, and a good many who own their own businesses. Is it like that on Jamaica, too?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and reached for a roll from the tray.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think so. It\u2019s true, there are some free blacks who earn a living for themselves, but those are the ones who have some skill\u2014sempstresses and fishers and such. I spoke to this Temeraire a bit. He was a cane-cutter until he lost his arm, and doesna ken how to do anything else much.\u201d</p><p>I laid the roll down, barely tasted, and frowned unhappily at the papers. The mere idea of owning a slave frightened and disgusted me, but it was beginning to dawn on me that it might not be so simple to divest myself of the responsibility.</p><p>The man had been taken from a barracoon on the Guinea coast, five years before. My original impulse, to return him to his home, was clearly impossible; even had it been possible to find a ship headed for Africa that would agree to take him as a passenger, the overwhelming likelihood was that he would be immediately enslaved again, either by the ship that accepted him, or by another slaver in the West African ports.</p><p>Traveling alone, one-armed and ignorant, he would have no protection at all. And even if he should by some miracle reach Africa safely and keep himself out of the hands of both European and African slavers, there was virtually no chance of his ever finding his way back to his village. Should he do so, Lawrence had kindly explained, he would likely be killed or driven away, as his own people would regard him now as a ghost, and a danger to them.</p><p>\u201cI dinna suppose ye would consider selling him?\u201d Jamie put the question delicately, raising one eyebrow. \u201cTo someone we could be sure would treat him kindly?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed two fingers between my brows, trying to soothe the growing headache.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that that\u2019s any better than owning him ourselves,\u201d I protested. \u201cWorse, probably, because we couldn\u2019t be sure what the new owners would do with him.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sighed. He had spent most of the day climbing through the dark, reeking cargo holds with Fergus, making up inventories against our arrival in Jamaica, and he was tired.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s no kindness to free him to starve, that I can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I fought back the uncharitable wish that I had never seen the one-armed slave. It would have been a great deal easier for me if I had not\u2014but possibly not for him.</p><p>Jamie rose from the berth and stretched himself, leaning on the desk and flexing his shoulders to ease them. He bent and kissed me on the forehead, between the brows.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash, Sassenach. I\u2019ll speak to the manager at Jared\u2019s plantation. Perhaps he can find the man some employment, or else\u2014\u201d</p><p>A warning shout from above interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cShip ahoy! Look alive, below! Off the port bow, ahoy!\u201d The lookout\u2019s cry was urgent, and there was a sudden rush and stir, as hands began to turn out. Then there was a lot more shouting, and a jerk and shudder as the Artemis backed her sails. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat in the name of God\u2014\u201d Jamie began. A rending crash drowned his words, and he pitched sideways, eyes wide with alarm, as the cabin tilted. The stool I was on fell over, throwing me onto the floor. The oil lamp had shot from its bracket, luckily extinguishing itself before hitting the floor, and the place was in darkness.</p><p>\u201cSassenach! Are ye all right?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice came out of the murk close at hand, sharp with anxiety.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, scrambling out from under the table. \u201cAre you? What happened? Did someone hit us?\u201d</p><p>Not pausing to answer any of these questions, Jamie had reached the door and opened it. A babel of shouts and thumps came down from the deck above, punctuated by the sudden popcorn-sound of small-arms fire.</p> <p>\u201cPirates,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been boarded.\u201d My eyes were becoming accustomed to the dim light; I saw his shadow lunge for the desk, reaching for the pistol in the drawer. He paused to snatch the dirk from under the pillow of his berth, and made for the door, issuing instructions as he went.</p><p>\u201cTake Marsali, Sassenach, and get below. Go aft as far as ye can get\u2014the big hold where the guano blocks are. Get behind them, and stay there.\u201d Then he was gone.</p><p>I spent a moment feeling my way through the cupboard over my berth, in search of the morocco box Mother Hildegarde had given me when I saw her in Paris. A scalpel might be little use against pirates, but I would feel better with a weapon of some kind in my hand, no matter how small.</p><p>\u201cMother Claire?\u201d Marsali\u2019s voice came from the door, high and scared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said. I caught the gleam of pale cotton as she moved, and pressed the ivory letter-opener into her hand. \u201cHere, take this, just in case. Come on; we\u2019re to go below.\u201d</p> <p>With a long-handled amputation blade in one hand, and a cluster of scalpels in the other, I led the way through the ship to the after hold. Feet thundered on the deck overhead, and curses and shouts rang through the night, overlaid with a dreadful groaning, scraping noise that I thought must be caused by the rubbing of the Artemis\u2019s timbers against those of the unknown ship that had rammed us.</p><p>The hold was black as pitch and thick with dusty fumes. We made our way slowly, coughing, toward the back of the hold.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d Marsali asked. Her voice had a strangely muffled sound, the echoes of the hold deadened by the blocks of guano stacked around us. \u201cPirates, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect they must be.\u201d Lawrence had told us that the Caribbean was a rich hunting ground for pirate luggers and unscrupulous craft of all kinds, but we had expected no trouble, as our cargo was not particularly valuable. \u201cI suppose they must not have much sense of smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said. \u201cCome sit down; there\u2019s nothing we can do but wait.\u201d</p> <p>I knew from experience that waiting while men fought was one of the most difficult things in life to do, but in this case, there wasn\u2019t any sensible alternative.</p><p>Down here, the sounds of the battle were muted to a distant thumping, though the constant rending groan of the scraping timbers echoed through the whole ship.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Fergus,\u201d Marsali whispered, listening, her voice filled with agony. \u201cBlessed Mary, save him!\u201d</p><p>I silently echoed the prayer, thinking of Jamie, somewhere in the chaos overhead. I crossed myself in the dark, touching the small spot between my brows that he had kissed a few minutes before, not wanting to think that it could so easily be the last touch of him I would ever know.</p><p>Suddenly, there was an explosion overhead, a roar that sent vibrations through the jutting timbers we were sitting on.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re blowing up the ship!\u201d Marsali jumped to her feet, panicked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll sink us! We must get out! We\u2019ll drown down here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I called. \u201cIt\u2019s only the guns!\u201d but she had not waited to hear. I could hear her, blundering about in a blind panic, whimpering among the blocks of guano.</p> <p>\u201cMarsali! Come back!\u201d There was no light at all in the hold; I took a few steps through the smothering atmosphere, trying to locate her by sound, but the deadening effect of the crumbling blocks hid her movements from me. There was another booming explosion overhead, and a third close on its heels. The air was filled with dust loosed from the vibrations, and I choked, eyes watering.</p><p>I wiped at my eyes with a sleeve, and blinked. I was not imagining it; there was a light in the hold, a dim glow that limned the edge of the nearest block.</p><p>\u201cMarsali?\u201d I called. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>The answer was a terrified shriek, from the direction of the light. I dashed around the edge of the block, dodged between two others, and emerged into the space by the ladder, to find Marsali in the clutches of a large, half-naked man.</p><p>He was hugely obese, the rolling layers of his fat decorated with a stipple of tattoos, a jangling necklace of coins and buttons hung round his neck. Marsali slapped at him, shrieking, and he jerked his face away, impatient.</p><p>Then he caught sight of me, and his eyes widened. He had a wide, flat face, and a tarred topknot of black hair. He grinned nastily at me, showing a marked lack of teeth, and said something that sounded like slurred Spanish.</p><p>\u201cLet her go!\u201d I said loudly. \u201cBasta, cabr\u00f3n!\u201d That was as much Spanish as I could summon; he seemed to think it funny, for he grinned more widely, let go of Marsali, and turned toward me. I threw one of my scalpels at him.</p><p>It bounced off his head, startling him, and he ducked wildly. Marsali dodged past him, and sprang for the ladder.</p><p>The pirate waffled for a moment, torn between us, but then turned to the ladder, leaping up several rungs with an agility that belied his weight. He caught Marsali by the foot as she dived through the hatch, and she screamed.</p><p>Cursing incoherently under my breath, I ran to the bottom of the ladder, and reaching up, swung the long-handled amputation knife at his foot, as hard as I could. There was a high-pitched screech from the pirate. Something flew past my head, and a spray of blood spattered across my cheek, wet-hot on my skin.</p><p>Startled, I dropped back, looking down by reflex to see what had fallen. It was a small brown toe, calloused and black-nailed, smudged with dirt.</p><p>The pirate hit the deck beside me with a thud that shivered the floorboards, and lunged. I ducked, but he caught a handful of my sleeve. I yanked away, ripping fabric, and jabbed at his face with the blade in my hand.</p><p>Jerking back in surprise, he slipped on his own blood and fell. I jumped for the ladder and climbed for my life, dropping the blade.</p><p>He was so close behind me that he succeeded in catching hold of the hem of my skirt, but I pulled it from his grasp and lunged upward, lungs burning from the dust of the choking hold. The man was shouting, a language I didn\u2019t know. Some dim recess of my brain, not occupied with immediate survival, speculated that it might be Portuguese.</p><p>I burst out of the hold onto the deck, into the midst of a surging chaos. The air was thick with black-powder smoke, and small knots of men were pushing and shoving, cursing and stumbling all over the deck.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take time to look around; there was a hoarse bellow from the hatchway behind me, and I dived for the rail. I hesitated for a moment, balanced on the narrow wooden strip. The sea spun past in a dizzy churn of black below. I grasped the rigging and began to climb.</p><p>It was a mistake; I knew that almost at once. He was a sailor, I was not. Neither was he hampered by wearing a dress. The ropes danced and jerked in my hands, vibrating under the impact of his weight as he hit the lines below me.</p><p>He was coming up the underside of the lines, climbing like a gibbon, even as I made my slower way across the upper slope of the rigging. He drew even with me, and spat in my face. I kept climbing, propelled by desperation; there was nothing else to do. He kept pace with me, easily, hissing words through an evil, half-toothed grin. It didn\u2019t matter what language he was speaking; his meaning was perfectly clear. Hanging by one hand, he drew the cutlass from his sash, and swung it in a vicious cut that barely missed me.</p><p>I was too frightened even to scream. There was nowhere to go, nothing to do. I squeezed my eyes tight shut, and hoped it would be quick.</p><p>It was. There was a sort of thump, a sharp grunt, and a strong smell of fish.</p><p>I opened my eyes. The pirate was gone. Ping An was sitting on the crosstrees, three feet away, crest erect with irritation, wings half-spread to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cGwa!\u201d he said crossly. He turned a beady little yellow eye on me, and clacked his bill in warning. Ping An hated noise and commotion. Evidently, he didn\u2019t like Portuguese pirates, either.</p><p>There were spots before my eyes, and I felt light-headed. I clung tight to the rope, shaking, until I thought I could move again. The noise below had slackened now, and the tenor of the shouting had changed. Something had happened; I thought it was over.</p><p>There was a new noise, a sudden flap of sails, and a long, grinding sound, with a vibration that made the line I was holding sing in my hand. It was over; the pirate ship was moving away. On the far side of the Artemis, I saw the web of the pirate\u2019s mast and rigging begin to move, black against the silver Caribbean sky. Very, very slowly, I began the long trip back down.</p><p>The lanterns were still lit below. A haze of black-powder smoke lay over everything, and bodies lay here and there about the deck. My glance flickered over them as I lowered myself, searching for red hair. I found it, and my heart leapt.</p><p>Jamie was sitting on a cask near the wheel, with his head tilted back, eyes closed, a cloth pressed to his brow, and a cup of whisky in his hand. Mr. Willoughby was on his knees alongside, administering first aid\u2014in the form of more whisky\u2014to Willie MacLeod, who sat against the foremast, looking sick.</p><p>I was shaking all over from exertion and reaction. I felt giddy and slightly cold. Shock, I supposed, and no wonder. I could do with a bit of that whisky as well.</p><p>I grasped the smaller lines above the rail, and slid the rest of the way to the deck, not caring that my palms were skinned raw. I was sweating and cold at the same time, and the down-hairs on my face were prickling unpleasantly.</p><p>I landed clumsily, with a thump that made Jamie straighten up and open his eyes. The look of relief in them pulled me the few feet to him. I felt better, with the warm solid flesh of his shoulder under my hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I said, leaning over him to look.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s no more than a wee dunt,\u201d he said, smiling up at me. There was a small gash at his hairline, where something like a pistol butt had caught him, but the blood had clotted already. There were stains of dark, drying blood on the front of his shirt, but the sleeve of his shirt was also bloody. In fact, it was nearly soaked, with fresh bright red.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d I clutched at his shoulder, my vision going white at the edges. \u201cYou aren\u2019t all right\u2014look, you\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</p><p>My hands and feet were numb, and I only half-felt his hands grasp my arms as he rose from the cask in sudden alarm. The last thing I saw, amid flashes of light, was his face, gone white beneath the tan.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d said his frightened voice, out of the whirling blackness. \u201cIt\u2019s no my blood, Sassenach, it\u2019s yours!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am not going to die,\u201d I said crossly, \u201cunless it\u2019s from heat exhaustion. Take some of this bloody stuff off me!\u201d</p><p>Marsali, who had been tearfully pleading with me not to expire, looked rather relieved at this outburst. She stopped crying and sniffed hopefully, but made no move to remove any of the cloaks, coats, blankets, and other impedimenta in which I was swaddled.</p><p>\u201cOh, I canna do that, Mother Claire!\u201d she said. \u201cDa says ye must be kept warm!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarm? I\u2019m being boiled alive!\u201d I was in the captain\u2019s cabin, and even with the stern windows wide open, the atmosphere belowdecks was stifling, hot with sun and acrid with the fumes of the cargo.</p> <p>I tried to struggle out from under my wrappings, but got no more than a few inches before a bolt of lightning struck me in the right arm. The world went dark, with small bright flashes zigging through my vision.</p><p>\u201cLie still,\u201d said a stern Scots voice, through a wave of giddy sickness. An arm was under my shoulders, a large hand cradling my head. \u201cAye, that\u2019s right, lie back on my arm. All right now, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, looking at the colored pinwheels inside my eyelids. \u201cI\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>I was, and a most unpleasant process it was, too, with fiery knives being jabbed into my right arm with each spasm.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I said at last, gasping.</p> <p>\u201cFinished, are ye?\u201d Jamie lowered me carefully and eased my head back onto the pillow.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean am I dead, the answer is unfortunately no.\u201d I cracked one eyelid open. He was kneeling by my berth, looking no end piratical himself, with a bloodstained strip of cloth bound round his head, and still wearing his blood-soaked shirt.</p><p>He stayed still, and so did the cabin, so I cautiously opened the other eye. He smiled faintly at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re no dead; Fergus will be glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>As though this had been a signal, the Frenchman\u2019s head poked anxiously into the cabin. Seeing me awake, his face broke into a dazzling smile and disappeared. I could hear his voice overhead, loudly informing the crew of my survival. To my profound embarrassment, the news was greeted with a rousing cheer from the upper deck.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jamie, pouring water into a cup, stopped and stared over the rim at me. He knelt down again beside me, snorting, and raised my head for a sip of water.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, she says! Aye, what indeed? I tell ye to stay all snug below wi\u2019 Marsali, and next thing I ken, ye\u2019ve dropped out of the sky and landed at my feet, sopping wi\u2019 blood!\u201d</p><p>He shoved his face into the berth and glared at me. Sufficiently impressive when clean-shaven and unhurt, he was considerably more ferocious when viewed, stubbled, bloodstained, and angry, at a distance of six inches. I promptly shut my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d he said peremptorily, and I did, against my better judgment.</p><p>Blue eyes bored into mine, narrowed with fury.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken ye came damn close to dying?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYe\u2019ve a bone-deep slash down your arm from oxter to elbow, and had I not got a cloth round it in time, ye\u2019d be feeding the sharks this minute!\u201d</p><p>One big fist crashed down on the side of the berth next to me, making me start. The movement hurt my arm, but I didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>\u201cDamn ye, woman! Will ye never do as you\u2019re told?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said meekly.</p><p>He turned a black scowl on me, but I could see the corner of his mouth twitching under the copper stubble.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said longingly. \u201cWhat I wouldna give to have ye tied facedown over a gun, and me wi\u2019 a rope\u2019s end in my hand.\u201d He snorted again, and pulled his face out of the berth.</p><p>\u201cWilloughby!\u201d he bellowed. In short order, Mr. Willoughby trotted in, beaming, with a steaming pot of tea and a bottle of brandy on a tray.</p><p>\u201cTea!\u201d I breathed, struggling to sit up. \u201cAmbrosia.\u201d In spite of the stifling atmosphere of the cabin, the hot tea was just what I needed. The delightful, brandy-laced stuff slid down my throat and glowed peacefully in the pit of my quivering stomach.</p><p>\u201cNobody makes tea better than the English,\u201d I said, inhaling the aroma, \u201cexcept the Chinese.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby beamed in gratification and bowed ceremoniously. Jamie snorted again, bringing his total up to three for the afternoon.</p><p>\u201cAye? Well, enjoy it while ye can.\u201d</p><p>This sounded more or less sinister, and I stared at him over the rim of the cup. \u201cAnd just what do you mean by that?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to doctor your arm when you\u2019re finished,\u201d he informed me. He picked up the pot and peered into it.</p><p>\u201cHow much blood did ye tell me a person has in his body?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout eight quarts,\u201d I said, bewildered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He lowered the pot and glared at me.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he said precisely, \u201cjudging from the amount ye left on the deck, you\u2019ve maybe four of them left. Here, have some more.\u201d He refilled the cup, set down the pot, and stalked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid Jamie\u2019s rather annoyed with me,\u201d I observed ruefully to Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>\u201cNot angry,\u201d he said comfortingly. \u201cTsei-mi scared very bad.\u201d The little Chinaman laid a hand on my right shoulder, delicate as a resting butterfly.</p><p>\u201cThis hurts?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cTo be perfectly honest,\u201d I said, \u201cyes, it does.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby smiled and patted me gently. \u201cI help,\u201d he said consolingly. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>In spite of the throbbing in my arm, I was feeling sufficiently restored to inquire about the rest of the crew, whose injuries, as reported by Mr. Willoughby, were limited to cuts and bruises, plus one concussion and a minor arm fracture.</p><p>A clatter in the passage heralded Jamie\u2019s return, accompanied by Fergus, who carried my medicine box under one arm, and yet another bottle of brandy in his hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, resigned. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>I was no stranger to horrible wounds, and this one\u2014technically speaking\u2014was not all that bad. On the other hand, it was my own personal flesh involved here, and I was not disposed to be technical.</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d I said rather faintly. While being a bit picturesque about the nature of the wound, Jamie had also been quite accurate. It was a long, clean-edged slash, running at a slight angle across the front of my biceps, from the shoulder to an inch or so above the elbow joint. And while I couldn\u2019t actually see the bone of my humerus, it was without doubt a very deep wound, gaping widely at the edges.</p><p>It was still bleeding, in spite of the cloth that had been wrapped tightly round it, but the seepage was slow; no major vessels seemed to have been severed.</p><p>Jamie had flipped open my medical box and was rootling meditatively through it with one large forefinger.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need sutures and a needle,\u201d I said, feeling a sudden jolt of alarm as it occurred to me that I was about to have thirty or forty stitches taken in my arm, with no anesthesia bar brandy.</p><p>\u201cNo laudanum?\u201d Jamie asked, frowning into the box. Evidently, he had been thinking along the same lines.</p><p>\u201cNo. I used it all on the Porpoise.\u201d Controlling the shaking of my left hand, I poured a sizable tot of straight brandy into my empty teacup, and took a healthy mouthful.</p><p>\u201cThat was thoughtful of you, Fergus,\u201d I said, nodding at the fresh brandy bottle as I sipped, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to take two bottles.\u201d Given the potency of Jared\u2019s French brandy, it was unlikely to take more than a teacupful.</p><p>I was wondering whether it was more advisable to get dead drunk at once, or to stay at least half-sober in order to supervise operations; there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that I could do the suturing myself, left-handed and shaking like a leaf. Neither could Fergus do it one-handed. True, Jamie\u2019s big hands could move with amazing lightness over some tasks, but...</p><p>Jamie interrupted my apprehensions, shaking his head and picking up the second bottle.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s no for drinking, Sassenach, that\u2019s for washing out the wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d In my state of shock, I had forgotten the necessity for disinfection. Lacking anything better, I normally washed out wounds with distilled grain alcohol, cut half and half with water, but I had used my supply of that as well, in our encounter with the man-of-war.</p><p>I felt my lips go slightly numb, and not just because the internal brandy was taking effect. Highlanders were among the most stoic and courageous of warriors, and seamen as a class weren\u2019t far behind. I had seen such men lie uncomplaining while I set broken bones, did minor surgery, sewed up terrible wounds, and put them through hell generally, but when it came to disinfection with alcohol, it was a different story\u2014the screams could be heard for miles.</p><p>\u201cEr...wait a minute,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe just a little boiled water....\u201d</p><p>Jamie was watching me, not without sympathy.</p><p>\u201cIt willna get easier wi\u2019 waiting, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cFergus, take the bottle.\u201d And before I could protest, he had lifted me out of the berth and sat down with me on his lap, holding me tight about the body, pinning my left arm so I couldn\u2019t struggle, while he took my right wrist in a firm grip and held my wounded arm out to the side.</p><p>I believe it was bloody old Ernest Hemingway who said you\u2019re supposed to pass out from pain, but unfortunately you never do. All I can say in response to that is that either Ernest had a fine distinction for states of consciousness, or else no one ever poured brandy on several cubic inches of his raw flesh.</p><p>To be fair, I suppose I must not absolutely have lost consciousness myself, since when I began noticing things again, Fergus was saying, \u201cPlease, milady! You must not scream like that; it upsets the men.\u201d</p><p>Clearly it upset Fergus; his lean face was pale, and droplets of sweat ran down his jaw. He was right about the men, too\u2014several faces were peering into the cabin from door and window, wearing expressions of horror and concern.</p><p>I summoned the presence of mind to nod weakly at them. Jamie\u2019s arm was still locked about my middle; I couldn\u2019t tell which of us was shaking; both, I thought.</p><p>I made it into the wide captain\u2019s chair, with considerable assistance, and lay back palpitating, the fire in my arm still sizzling. Jamie was holding one of my curved suture needles and a length of sterilized cat-gut, looking as dubious over the prospects as I felt.</p><p>It was Mr. Willoughby who intervened, quietly taking the needle from Jamie\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d he said, in tones of authority. \u201cA moment.\u201d And he disappeared aft, presumably to fetch something.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t protest, and neither did I. We heaved twin sighs of relief, in fact, which made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd to think,\u201d I said, \u201cI once told Bree that big men were kind and gentle, and the short ones tended to be nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose there\u2019s always the exception that proves the rule, no?\u201d He mopped my streaming face with a wet cloth, quite gently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI dinna want to know how ye did this,\u201d he said, with a sigh, \u201cbut for God\u2019s sake, Sassenach, don\u2019t do it again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t intend to do anything...\u201d I began crossly, when I was interrupted by the return of Mr. Willoughby. He was carrying the little roll of green silk I had seen when he cured Jamie\u2019s seasickness.</p><p>\u201cOh, ye\u2019ve got the wee stabbers?\u201d Jamie peered interestedly at the small gold needles, then smiled at me. \u201cDinna fash yourself, Sassenach, they don\u2019t hurt...or not much, anyway,\u201d he added.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby\u2019s fingers probed the palm of my right hand, prodding here and there. Then he grasped each of my fingers, wiggled it, and pulled it gently, so that I felt the joints pop slightly. Then he laid two fingers at the base of my wrist, pressing down in the space between the radius and the ulna.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the Inner Gate,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHere is quiet. Here is peace.\u201d I sincerely hoped he was right. Picking up one of the tiny gold needles, he placed the point over the spot he had marked, and with a dexterous twirl of thumb and forefinger, pierced the skin.</p><p>The prick made me jump, but he kept a tight, warm hold on my hand, and I relaxed again.</p><p>He placed three needles in each wrist, and a rakish, porcupine-like spray on the crest of my right shoulder. I was getting interested, despite my guinea pig status. Beyond an initial prick at placement, the needles caused no discomfort. Mr. Willoughby was humming, in a low, soothing sort of way, tapping and pressing places on my neck and shoulder.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t honestly tell whether my right arm was numbed, or whether I was simply distracted by the goings-on, but it did feel somewhat less agonized\u2014at least until he picked up the suture needle and began.</p><p>Jamie was sitting on a stool by my left side, holding my left hand as he watched my face. After a moment, he said, rather gruffly, \u201cLet your breath out, Sassenach; it\u2019s no going to get any worse than that.\u201d</p> <p>I let go of the breath I hadn\u2019t realized I was holding, and realized as well what he was telling me. It was dread of being hurt that had me rigid as a board in the chair. The actual pain of the stitches was unpleasant, all right, but nothing I couldn\u2019t stand.</p><p>I let my breath out cautiously, and gave him a rough approximation of a smile. Mr. Willoughby was singing under his breath in Chinese. Jamie had translated the words for me a week earlier; it was a pillow-song, in which a young man catalogued the physical charms of his partner, one by one. I hoped he would finish the stitching before he got to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a verra wicked slash,\u201d Jamie said, eyes on Mr. Willoughby\u2019s work. I preferred not to look myself. \u201cA parang, was it, or a cutlass, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was a cutlass,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, I know it was. He came after...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what led them to attack us,\u201d Jamie said, not paying any attention to me. His brows were drawn in speculation. \u201cIt canna ha\u2019 been the cargo, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think so,\u201d I said. \u201cBut maybe they didn\u2019t know what we were carrying?\u201d This seemed grossly unlikely; any ship that came within a hundred yards of us would have known\u2014the ammoniac reek of bat guano hovered round us like a miasma.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s only they thought the ship small enough to take. The Artemis itself would bring a fair price, cargo or no.\u201d</p><p>I blinked as Mr. Willoughby paused in his song to tie a knot. I thought he was down to the navel by now, but wasn\u2019t paying close attention.</p><p>\u201cDo we know the name of the pirate ship?\u201d I asked. \u201cGranted, there\u2019s likely a lot of pirates in these waters, but we do know that the Bruja was in this area three days ago, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldna see a great deal in the darkness, but she was the right size, wi\u2019 that wide Spanish beam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the pirate that was after me spoke\u2014\u201d I started, but the sound of voices in the corridor made me stop.</p><p>Fergus edged in, shy of interrupting, but obviously bursting with excitement. He held something shiny and jingling in one hand.</p><p>\u201cMilord,\u201d he said, \u201cMaitland has found a dead pirate on the forward deck.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s red brows went up, and he looked from Fergus to me.</p> <p>\u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery dead, milord,\u201d said Fergus, with a small shudder. Maitland was peeking over his shoulder, anxious to claim his share of the glory. \u201cOh, yes, sir,\u201d he assured Jamie earnestly. \u201cDead as a doornail; his poor head\u2019s bashed in something shocking!\u201d</p><p>All three men turned and stared at me. I gave them a modest little smile.</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand over his face. His eyes were bloodshot, and a trickle of blood had dried in front of his ear.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he began, in measured tones.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you,\u201d I said virtuously. Between shock, brandy, acupuncture, and the dawning realization of survival, I was beginning to feel quite pleasantly light-headed. I scarcely noticed Mr. Willoughby\u2019s final efforts.</p><p>\u201cHe was wearing this, milord.\u201d Fergus stepped forward and laid the pirate\u2019s necklace on the table in front of us. It had the silver buttons from a military uniform, polished kona nuts, several large shark\u2019s teeth, pieces of polished abalone shell and chunks of mother of pearl, and a large number of jingling coins, all pierced for stringing on a leather thong.</p><p>\u201cI thought you should see this at once, milord,\u201d Fergus continued. He reached out a hand and lifted one of the shimmering coins. It was silver, untarnished, and through the gathering brandy haze, I could see on its face the twin heads of Alexander. A tetradrachm, of the fourth century B.C. Mint condition.</p><p>Thoroughly worn out by the events of the afternoon, I had fallen asleep at once, the pain in my arm dulled by brandy. Now it was full dark, and the brandy had worn off. My arm seemed to swell and throb with each beat of my heart, and any small movement sent tiny jabs of a sharper pain whipping through my arm, like warning flicks of a scorpion\u2019s tail.</p><p>The moon was three-quarters full, a huge lopsided shape like a golden teardrop, hanging just above the horizon. The ship heeled slightly, and the moon slid slowly out of sight, the Man in the Moon leering rather unpleasantly as he went. I was hot, and possibly a trifle feverish.</p><p>There was a jug of water in the cupboard on the far side of the cabin. I felt weak and giddy as I swung my feet over the edge of the berth, and my arm registered a strong protest against being disturbed. I must have made some sound, for the darkness on the floor of the cabin stirred suddenly, and Jamie\u2019s voice came drowsily from the region of my feet.</p><p>\u201cAre ye hurting, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d I said, not wanting to be dramatic about it. I set my lips and rose unsteadily to my feet, cradling my right elbow in my left hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good?\u201d I said, my voice rising indignantly.</p><p>There was a soft chuckle from the darkness, and he sat up, his head popping suddenly into sight as it rose above the shadows into the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cAye, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a wound begins to hurt ye, it means it\u2019s healing. Ye didna feel it when it happened, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. I certainly felt it now. The air was a good deal cooler out on the open sea, and the salt wind coming through the window felt good on my face. I was damp and sticky with sweat, and the thin chemise clung to my br**sts.</p><p>\u201cI could see ye didn\u2019t. That\u2019s what frightened me. Ye never feel a fatal wound, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I laughed shortly, but cut it off as the movement jarred my arm.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d I asked, fumbling left-handed to pour water into a cup. \u201cNot the sort of thing you\u2019d learn firsthand, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurtagh told me.\u201d</p><p>The water seemed to purl soundlessly into the cup, the sound of its pouring lost in the hiss of the bow-wave outside. I set down the jug and lifted the cup, the surface of the water black in the moonlight. Jamie had never mentioned Murtagh to me, in the months of our reunion. I had asked Fergus, who told me that the wiry little Scot had died at Culloden, but he knew no more than the bare fact.</p><p>\u201cAt Culloden.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was barely loud enough to be heard above the creak of timber and the whirring of the wind that bore us along. \u201cDid ye ken they burnt the bodies there? I wondered, listening to them do it\u2014what it would be like inside the fire when it came my turn.\u201d I could hear him swallow, above the creaking of the ship. \u201cI found that out, this morning.\u201d</p><p>The moonlight robbed his face of depth and color; he looked like a skull, with the broad, clean planes of cheek and jawbone white and his eyes black empty pits.</p><p>\u201cI went to Culloden meaning to die,\u201d he said, his voice scarcely more than a whisper. \u201cNot the rest of them. I should have been happy to stop a musket ball at once, and yet I cut my way across the field and halfway back, while men on either side o\u2019 me were blown to bloody bits.\u201d He stood up, then, looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy, Claire? Why am I alive, and they are not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said softly. \u201cFor your sister, and your family, maybe? For me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had families,\u201d he said. \u201cWives, and sweethearts; children to mourn them. And yet they are gone. And I am still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Jamie,\u201d I said at last. I touched his cheek, already roughened by newly sprouting beard, irrepressible evidence of life. \u201cYou aren\u2019t ever going to know.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, his cheekbone pressed against my palm for a moment.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken that well enough. But I canna help the asking, when I think of them\u2014especially Murtagh.\u201d He turned restlessly away, his eyes empty shadows, and I knew he walked Drumossie Moor again, with the ghosts.</p><p>\u201cWe should have gone sooner; the men had been standing for hours, starved and half-frozen. But they waited for His Highness to give the order to charge.\u201d</p><p>And Charles Stuart, perched safely on a rock, well behind the line of battle, having seized personal command of his troops for the first time, had dithered and delayed. And the English cannon had had time to bear squarely on the lines of ragged Highlanders, and opened fire.</p><p>\u201cIt was a relief, I think,\u201d Jamie said softly. \u201cEvery man on the field knew the cause was lost, and we were dead. And still we stood there, watching the English guns come up, and the cannon mouths open black before us. No one spoke. I couldna hear anything but the wind, and the English soldiers shouting, on the other side of the field.\u201d</p><p>And then the guns had roared, and men had fallen, and those still standing, rallied by a late and ragged order, had seized their swords and charged the enemy, the sound of their Gaelic shrieking drowned by the guns, lost in the wind.</p><p>\u201cThe smoke was so thick, I couldna see more than a few feet before me. I kicked off my shoon and ran into it, shouting.\u201d The bloodless line of his lips turned up slightly.</p><p>\u201cI was happy,\u201d he said, sounding a bit surprised. \u201cNot scairt at all. I meant to die, after all; there was nothing to fear except that I might be wounded and not die at once. But I would die, and then it would be all over, and I would find ye again, and it would be all right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I moved closer to him, and his hand rose up from the shadows to take mine.</p><p>\u201cMen fell to either side of me, and I could hear the grapeshot and the musket balls hum past my head like bumblebees. But I wasna touched.\u201d</p><p>He had reached the British lines unscathed, one of very few Highlanders to have completed the charge across Culloden Moor. An English gun crew looked up, startled, at the tall Highlander who burst from the smoke like a demon, the blade of his broadsword gleaming with rain and then dull with blood.</p><p>\u201cThere was a small part of my mind that asked why I should be killin\u2019 them,\u201d he said reflectively. \u201cFor surely I knew that we were lost; there was no gain to it. But there is a lust to killing\u2014you\u2019ll know that?\u201d His fingers tightened on mine, questioning, and I squeezed back in affirmation.</p> <p>\u201cI couldna stop\u2014or I would not.\u201d His voice was quiet, without bitterness or recrimination. \u201cIt\u2019s a verra old feeling, I think; the wish to take an enemy with ye to the grave. I could feel it there, a hot red thing in my chest and belly, and...I gave myself to it,\u201d he ended simply.</p><p>There were four men tending the cannon, none armed with more than a pistol and knife, none expecting attack at such close quarters. They stood helpless against the berserk strength of his despair, and he killed them all.</p><p>\u201cThe ground shook under my feet,\u201d he said, \u201cand I was near deafened by the noise. I couldna think. And then it came to me that I was behind the English guns.\u201d A soft chuckle came from below. \u201cA verra poor place to try to be killed, no?\u201d</p><p>So he had started back across the moor, to join the Highland dead.</p><p>\u201cHe was sitting against a tussock near the middle of the field\u2014Murtagh. He\u2019d been struck a dozen times at least, and there was a dreadful wound in his head\u2014I knew he was dead.\u201d</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t been, though; when Jamie had fallen to his knees beside his godfather and taken the small body in his arms, Murtagh\u2019s eyes had opened. \u201cHe saw me. And he smiled.\u201d And then the older man\u2019s hand had touched his cheek briefly. \u201cDinna be afraid, a bhalaich,\u201d Murtagh had said, using the endearment for a small, beloved boy. \u201cIt doesna hurt a bit to die.\u201d</p><p>I stood quietly for a long time, holding Jamie\u2019s hand. Then he sighed, and his other hand closed very, very gently about my wounded arm.</p><p>\u201cToo many folk have died, Sassenach, because they knew me\u2014or suffered for the knowing. I would give my own body to save ye a moment\u2019s pain\u2014and yet I could wish to close my hand just now, that I might hear ye cry out and know for sure that I havena killed you, too.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward, pressing a kiss on the skin of his chest. He slept naked in the heat.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t killed me. You didn\u2019t kill Murtagh. And we\u2019ll find Ian. Take me back to bed, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Sometime later, as I drowsed on the edge of sleep, he spoke from the floor beside my bed.</p> <p>\u201cYe know, I seldom wanted to go home to Laoghaire,\u201d he said contemplatively. \u201cAnd yet, at least when I did, I\u2019d find her where I\u2019d left her.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to the side, where his soft breathing came from the darkened floor. \u201cOh? And is that the kind of wife you want? The sort who stays put?\u201d</p><p>He made a small sound between a chuckle and a cough, but didn\u2019t answer, and after a few moments, the sound of his breathing changed to a soft, rhythmic snore.</p><p>55</p><p>ISHMAEL</p><p>I slept restlessly, and woke up late and feverish, with a throbbing headache just behind my eyes. I felt ill enough not to protest when Marsali insisted on bathing my forehead, but relaxed gratefully, eyes closed, enjoying the cool touch of the vinegar-soaked cloth on my pounding temples.</p><p>It was so soothing, in fact, that I drifted off to sleep again after she left. I was dreaming uneasily of dark mine shafts and the chalk of charred bones, when I was suddenly roused by a crash that brought me bolt upright and sent a shaft of pure white pain ripping through my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed, clutching my head in both hands, as though this might prevent it falling off. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The window had been covered to keep the light from disturbing me, and it took a moment for my stunned vision to adapt to the dimness.</p> <p>On the opposite side of the cabin, a large figure was mimicking me, clutching its own head in apparent agony. Then it spoke, releasing a volley of very bad language, in a mixture of Chinese, French, and Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d it said, the exclamations tapering off into milder English. \u201cGoddamn it to hell!\u201d Jamie staggered to the window, still rubbing the head he had smashed on the edge of my cupboard. He shoved aside the covering and pushed the window open, bringing a welcome draft of fresh air in along with a dazzle of light.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of bloody hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d I demanded, with considerable asperity. The light jabbed my tender eyeballs like needles, and the movement involved in clutching my head had done the stitches in my arm no good at all.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for your medicine box,\u201d he replied, wincing as he felt the crown of his head. \u201cDamn, I\u2019ve caved in my skull. Look at that!\u201d He thrust two fingers, slightly smeared with blood, under my nose. I dropped the vinegar-soaked cloth over the fingers and collapsed back on my pillow.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need the medicine box, and why didn\u2019t you ask me in the first place, instead of bumping around like a bee in a bottle?\u201d I said irritably.</p><p>\u201cI didna want to wake ye from your sleep,\u201d he said, sheepishly enough that I laughed, despite the various throbbings going on in my anatomy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right; I wasn\u2019t enjoying it,\u201d I assured him. \u201cWhy do you need the box? Is someone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. I am,\u201d he said, dabbing gingerly at the top of his head with the cloth and scowling at the result. \u201cYe dinna want to look at my head?\u201d</p><p>The answer to this was \u201cNot especially,\u201d but I obligingly motioned to him to bend over, presenting the top of his head for inspection. There was a reasonably impressive lump under the thick hair, with a small cut from the edge of the shelf, but the damage seemed a bit short of concussion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fractured,\u201d I assured him. \u201cYou have the thickest skull I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Moved by an instinct as old as motherhood, I leaned forward and kissed the bump gently. He lifted his head, eyes wide with surprise.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s supposed to make it feel better,\u201d I explained. A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, then.\u201d He bent down and gently kissed the bandage on my wounded arm.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he inquired, straightening up.</p><p>\u201cLots.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and reaching for the decanter, poured out a tot of whisky, which he handed to me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted that stuff ye use to wash out scrapes and such,\u201d he explained, pouring another for himself.</p><p>\u201cHawthorn lotion. I haven\u2019t got any ready-made, because it doesn\u2019t keep,\u201d I said, pushing myself upright. \u201cIf it\u2019s urgent, though, I can brew some; it doesn\u2019t take long.\u201d The thought of getting up and walking to the galley was daunting, but perhaps I\u2019d feel better once I was moving.</p><p>\u201cNot urgent,\u201d he assured me. \u201cIt\u2019s only there\u2019s a prisoner in the hold who\u2019s a bit bashed about.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my cup, blinking at him.</p><p>\u201cA prisoner? Where did we get a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the pirate ship.\u201d He frowned at his whisky. \u201cThough I dinna think he\u2019s a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he?\u201d</p><p>He tossed off the whisky neatly, in one gulp, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know. From the scars on his back, likely a runaway slave, but in that case, I canna think why he did what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDived off the Bruja into the sea. MacGregor saw him go, and then after the Bruja made sail, he saw the man bobbing about in the waves and threw him a rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that is funny; why should he do that?\u201d I asked. I was becoming interested, and the throbbing in my head seemed to be lessening as I sipped my whisky.</p><p>Jamie ran his fingers through his hair, and stopped, wincing.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken, Sassenach,\u201d he said, gingerly smoothing the hair on his crown flat. \u201cIt wouldna be likely for a crew like ours to try to board the pirate\u2014any merchant would just fight them off; there\u2019s no reason to try to take them. But if he didna mean to escape from us\u2014perhaps he meant to escape from them, aye?\u201d</p><p>The last golden drops of the whisky ran down my throat. It was Jared\u2019s special blend, the next-to-last bottle, and thoroughly justified the name he had given it\u2014Ce\u00f2 Gheasacach. \u201cMagic Mist.\u201d Feeling somewhat restored, I pushed myself upright.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s hurt, perhaps I should take a look at him,\u201d I suggested, swinging my feet out of the berth.</p><p>Given Jamie\u2019s behavior of the day before, I fully expected him to press me flat and call for Marsali to come and sit on my chest. Instead, he looked at me thoughtfully, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. If ye\u2019re sure ye can stand, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t all that sure, but gave it a try. The room tilted when I stood up, and black and yellow spots danced before my eyes, but I stayed upright, clinging to Jamie\u2019s arm. After a moment, a small amount of blood reluctantly consented to reenter my head, and the spots went away, showing Jamie\u2019s face looking anxiously down at me.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cCarry on.\u201d</p><p>The prisoner was below in what the crew called the orlop, a lower-deck space full of miscellaneous cargo. There was a small timbered area, walled off at the bow of the ship, that sometimes housed drunk or unruly seamen, and here he had been secured.</p><p>It was dark and airless down in the bowels of the ship, and I felt myself becoming dizzy again as I made my way slowly along the companionway behind Jamie and the glow of his lantern.</p><p>When he unlocked the door, at first I saw nothing at all in the makeshift brig. Then, as Jamie stooped to enter with his lantern, the shine of the man\u2019s eyes betrayed his presence. \u201cBlack as the ace of spades\u201d was the first thought that popped into my slightly addled mind, as the edges of face and form took shape against the darkness of the timbers.</p><p>No wonder Jamie had thought him a runaway slave. The man looked African, not island-born. Besides the deep red-black of his skin, his demeanor wasn\u2019t that of a man raised as a slave. He was sitting on a cask, hands bound behind his back and feet tied together, but I saw his head rise and his shoulders straighten as Jamie ducked under the lintel of the tiny space. He was very thin, but very muscular, clad in nothing but a ragged pair of trousers. The lines of his body were clear; he was tensed for attack or defense, but not submission.</p><p>Jamie saw it, too, and motioned me to stay well back against the wall. He placed the lantern on a cask, and squatted down before the captive, at eye-level.</p><p>\u201cAmiki,\u201d he said, spreading out his empty hands, palm up. \u201cAmiki. Bene-bene.\u201d Friend. Is good. It was taki-taki, the all-purpose pidgin polyglot that the traders from Barbados to Trinidad spoke in the ports. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man stared impassively at Jamie for a moment, eyes still as tide pools. Then one eyebrow flicked up and he extended his bound feet before him.</p><p>\u201cBene-bene, amiki?\u201d he said, with an ironic intonation that couldn\u2019t be missed, whatever the language. Is good, friend?</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly, amused, and rubbed a finger under his nose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a point,\u201d he said in English.</p> <p>\u201cDoes he speak English, or French?\u201d I moved a little closer. The captive\u2019s eyes rested on me for a moment, then passed away, indifferent.</p><p>\u201cIf he does, he\u2019ll no admit it. Picard and Fergus tried talking to him last night. He willna say a word, just stares at them. What he just said is the first he\u2019s spoken since he came aboard. \u00c0Habla Espa\u00f1ol?\u201d he said suddenly to the prisoner. There was no response. The man didn\u2019t even look at Jamie; just went on staring impassively at the square of open doorway behind me.</p><p>\u201cEr, sprechen sie Deutsche?\u201d I said tentatively. He didn\u2019t answer, which was just as well, as the question had exhausted my own supply of German. \u201cNicht Hollander, either, I don\u2019t suppose.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shot me a sardonic look. \u201cI canna tell much about him, Sassenach, but I\u2019m fairly sure he\u2019s no a Dutchman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have slaves on Eleuthera, don\u2019t they? That\u2019s a Dutch island,\u201d I said irritably. \u201cOr St. Croix\u2014that\u2019s Danish, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Slowly as my mind was working this morning, it hadn\u2019t escaped me that the captive was our only clue to the pirates\u2019 whereabouts\u2014and the only frail link to Ian. \u201cDo you know enough taki-taki to ask him about Ian?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie shook his head, eyes intent on the prisoner. \u201cNo. Besides what I said to him already, I ken how to say \u2018not good,\u2019 \u2018how much?\u2019 \u2018give it to me,\u2019 and \u2018drop that, ye bastard,\u2019 none of which seems a great deal to the point at present.\u201d</p><p>Stymied for the moment, we stared at the prisoner, who stared impassively back.</p><p>\u201cTo hell with it,\u201d Jamie said suddenly. He drew the dirk from his belt, went behind the cask, and sawed through the thongs around the prisoner\u2019s wrists.</p><p>He cut the ankle bindings as well, then sat back on his heels, the knife laid across his thigh.</p><p>\u201cFriend,\u201d he said firmly in taki-taki. \u201cIs good?\u201d</p><p>The prisoner didn\u2019t say anything, but after a moment, he nodded slightly, his expression warily quizzical.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chamber pot in the corner,\u201d Jamie said in English, rising and sheathing his dirk. \u201cUse it, and then my wife will tend your wounds.\u201d</p><p>A very faint flicker of amusement crossed the man\u2019s face. He nodded once more, this time in acceptance of defeat. He rose slowly from the cask and turned, stiff hands fumbling at his trousers. I looked askance at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst things about being bound that way,\u201d he explained matter-of-factly. \u201cYe canna take a piss by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said, not wanting to think about how he knew that.</p><p>\u201cThat, and the pain in your shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful touching him, Sassenach.\u201d The note of warning in his voice was clear, and I nodded. It wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s shoulders he was concerned about.</p><p>I still felt light-headed, and the stuffiness of the surroundings had made my headache throb again, but I was less battered than the prisoner, who had indeed been \u201cbashed about\u201d at some stage of the proceedings.</p><p>Bashed though he was, his injuries seemed largely superficial. A swollen knot rose on the man\u2019s forehead, and a deep scrape had left a crusted reddish patch on one shoulder. He was undoubtedly bruised in a number of places, but given the remarkably deep shade of his skin and the darkness of the surroundings, I couldn\u2019t tell where.</p><p>There were deep bands of rawness on ankles and wrists, where he had pulled against the thongs. I hadn\u2019t made any of the hawthorn lotion, but I had brought the jar of gentian salve. I eased myself down on the deck next to him, but he took no more notice of me than of the deck beneath his feet, even when I began to spread the cool blue cream on his wounds.</p> <p>What was more interesting than the fresh injuries, though, were the healed ones. At close range, I could see the faint white lines of three parallel slashes, running across the slope of each cheekbone, and a series of three short vertical lines on the high, narrow forehead, just between his brows. Tribal scars. African-born for sure, then; such scars were made during manhood rituals, or so Murphy had told me.</p><p>His flesh was warm and smooth under my fingers, slicked with sweat. I felt warm, too; sweaty and unwell. The deck rose gently beneath me, and I put my hand on his back to keep my balance. The thin, tough lines of healed whipstrokes webbed his shoulders, like the furrows of tiny worms beneath his skin. The feel of them was unexpected; so much like the feel of the marks on Jamie\u2019s own back. I swallowed, feeling queasy, but went on with my doctoring.</p><p>The man ignored me completely, even when I touched spots I knew must be painful. His eyes were fixed on Jamie, who was watching the prisoner with equal intentness.</p><p>The problem was plain. The man was almost certainly a runaway slave. He hadn\u2019t wanted to speak to us, for fear that his speech would give away his owner\u2019s island, and that we would then find out his original owner and return him to captivity.</p><p>Now we knew that he spoke\u2014or at least understood\u2014English, it was bound to increase his wariness. Even if we assured him that it was not our intention either to return him to an owner or to enslave him ourselves, he was unlikely to trust us. I couldn\u2019t say that I blamed him, under the circumstances.</p><p>On the other hand, this man was our best\u2014and possibly the only\u2014chance of finding out what had happened to Ian Murray aboard the Bruja.</p><p>When at length I had bandaged the man\u2019s wrists and ankles, Jamie gave me a hand to rise, then spoke to the prisoner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be hungry, I expect,\u201d he said. \u201cCome along to the cabin, and we\u2019ll eat.\u201d Not waiting for a response, he took my good arm and turned to the door. There was silence behind us as we moved into the corridor, but when I looked back, the slave was there, following a few feet behind.</p><p>Jamie led us to my cabin, disregarding the curious glances of the sailors we passed, only stopping by Fergus long enough to order food to be sent from the galley.</p><p>\u201cBack to bed with ye, Sassenach,\u201d he said firmly, when we reached the cabin. I didn\u2019t argue. My arm hurt, my head hurt, and I could feel little waves of heat flickering behind my eyes. It looked as though I would have to break down and use a little of the precious penicillin on myself, after all. There was still a chance that my body could throw off the infection, but I couldn\u2019t afford to wait too long.</p><p>Jamie had poured out a glass of whisky for me, and another for our guest. Still wary, the man accepted it, and took a sip, eyes widening in surprise. I supposed Scotch whisky must be a novelty to him.</p><p>Jamie took a glass for himself and sat down, motioning the slave to the other seat, across the small table.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Fraser,\u201d he said. \u201cI am captain here. My wife,\u201d he added, with a nod toward my berth.</p><p>The prisoner hesitated, but then set down his glass with an air of decision.</p><p>\u201cThey be callin\u2019 me Ishmael,\u201d he said, in a voice like honey poured over coal. \u201cI ain\u2019t no pirate. I be a cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy\u2019s going to like that,\u201d I remarked, but Jamie ignored me. There was a faint line between the ruddy brows, as he felt his way into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cA ship\u2019s cook?\u201d he asked, taking care to make his voice sound casual. Only the tap of his two stiff fingers against his thigh betrayed him\u2014and that, only to me.</p><p>\u201cNo, mon, I don\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to do with that ship!\u201d Ishmael was vehement. \u201cThey taken me off the shore, say they kill me, I don\u2019 go long by them, be easy. I ain\u2019t no pirate!\u201d he repeated, and it dawned on me belatedly that of course he wouldn\u2019t wish to be taken for a pirate\u2014whether he was one or not. Piracy was punishable by hanging, and he could have no way of knowing that we were as eager as he to stay clear of the Royal Navy.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see.\u201d Jamie hit the right balance, between soothing and skeptical. He leaned back slightly in the big wheel-backed chair. \u201cAnd how did the Bruja come to take ye prisoner, then? Not where,\u201d he added quickly, as a look of alarm flitted across the prisoner\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYe needna tell me where ye came from; that\u2019s of no concern to me. Only I should care to know how ye came to fall into their hands, and how long ye\u2019ve been with them. Since, as ye say, ye werena one of them.\u201d The hint was broad enough to spread butter on. We didn\u2019t mean to return him to his owner; however, if he didn\u2019t oblige with information, we might just turn him over to the Crown as a pirate.</p><p>The prisoner\u2019s eyes darkened; no fool, he had grasped the point at once. His head twitched briefly sideways, and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI be catchin\u2019 fish by the river,\u201d he said. \u201cBig ship, he come sailin\u2019 up the river slow, little boats be pullin\u2019 him. Men in the little boat, they see me, holler out. I drop the fish, be runnin\u2019, but they close by. They men jump out, kotch me by the cane field, figure they take me to sell. Tha\u2019s all, mon.\u201d He shrugged, signaling the conclusion of his story.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see.\u201d Jamie\u2019s eyes were intent on the prisoner. He hesitated, wanting to ask where the river was, but not quite daring to, for fear the man would clam up again. \u201cWhile ye were on the ship\u2014did ye see any boys among the crew, or as prisoners, too? Boys, young men?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened slightly; he hadn\u2019t been expecting that. He paused warily, but then nodded, with a faintly derisive glint in his eye.</p><p>\u201cYes, mon, they have boys. Why? You be wantin\u2019 one?\u201d His glance flicked to me and then back to Jamie, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head jerked, and a slight flush rose on his cheekbones at the implication.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said levelly. \u201cI am looking for a young kinsman who was taken by pirates. I should feel myself greatly obliged to anyone who might assist me in finding him.\u201d He lifted one eyebrow significantly.</p><p>The prisoner grunted slightly, his nostrils flaring.</p><p>\u201cThat so? What you be doin\u2019 for me, I be helpin\u2019 you fin\u2019 this boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should set you ashore at any port of your choosing, with a fair sum in gold,\u201d Jamie replied. \u201cBut of course I should require proof that ye did have knowledge of my nephew\u2019s whereabouts, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d The prisoner was still wary, but beginning to relax. \u201cYou tell me, mon\u2014what this boy be like?\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated for a moment, studying the prisoner, but then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI dinna think that will work. You describe to me such lads as ye saw on the pirate vessel.\u201d</p><p>The prisoner eyed Jamie for a moment, then broke out in a low, rich laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou no particular fool, mon,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cSo long as ye know it as well. Tell me, then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ishmael snorted briefly, but complied, pausing only to refresh himself from the tray of food Fergus had brought. Fergus himself lounged against the door, watching the prisoner through half-lidded eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey be twelve boys talkin\u2019 strange, like you.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyebrows shot up, and he exchanged a glance of astonishment with me. Twelve?</p><p>\u201cLike me?\u201d He said. \u201cWhite boys, English? Or Scots, d\u2019ye mean?\u201d</p> <p>Ishmael shook his head in incomprehension; \u201cScot\u201d was not in his vocabulary.</p><p>\u201cTalkin\u2019 like dogs fightin\u2019,\u201d he explained. \u201cGrrrr! Wuff!\u201d He growled, shaking his head in illustration like a dog worrying a rat, and I saw Fergus\u2019s shoulders shake in suppressed hilarity.</p><p>\u201cScots for sure,\u201d I said, trying not to laugh. Jamie shot me a brief dirty look, then returned his attention to Ishmael.</p><p>\u201cVerra well, then,\u201d he said, exaggerating his natural soft burr. \u201cTwelve Scottish lads. What did they look like?\u201d</p><p>Ishmael squinted dubiously, chewing a piece of mango from the tray. He wiped the juice from the corner of his mouth and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cI only see them once, mon. Tell you all I see, though.\u201d He closed his eyes and frowned, the vertical lines on his forehead drawing close together.</p><p>\u201cFour boys be yellow-haired, six brown, two with black hair. Two shorter than me, one maybe the size that griffone there\u201d\u2014he nodded toward Fergus, who stiffened in outrage at the insult\u2014\u201cone big, not so big as you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and how will they have been dressed?\u201d Slowly, carefully, Jamie drew him through the descriptions, asking for details, demanding comparisons\u2014how tall? how fat? what color eyes?\u2014carefully concealing the direction of his interest as he drew the man further into conversation.</p><p>My head had stopped spinning, but the fatigue was still there, weighting my senses. I let my eyes close, obscurely soothed by the deep, murmuring voices. Jamie did sound rather like a big, fierce dog, I thought, with his soft growling burr and the abrupt, clipped sound of his consonants.</p><p>\u201cWuff,\u201d I murmured under my breath, and my belly muscles quivered slightly under my folded hands.</p><p>Ishmael\u2019s voice was just as deep, but smooth and low, rich as hot chocolate made with cream. I began to drift, lulled by the sound of it.</p> <p>He sounded like Joe Abernathy, I thought drowsily, dictating an autopsy report\u2014unvarnished and unappetizing physical details, related in a voice like a deep golden lullaby.</p><p>I could see Joe\u2019s hands in memory, dark on the pale skin of an accident victim, moving swiftly as he made his verbal notes to the tape recorder.</p><p>\u201cDeceased is a tall man, approximately six feet in height, and slender in build....\u201d</p><p>A tall man, slender.</p><p>\u201c\u2014that one, he bein\u2019 tall, bein\u2019 thin...\u201d</p><p>I came awake suddenly, heart pounding, hearing the echo of Joe\u2019s voice coming from the table a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said, quite suddenly, and all three men stopped and looked at me in surprise. I pushed back the weight of my damp hair and waved weakly at them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me; I was dreaming, I think.\u201d</p> <p>They returned to their conversation, and I lay still, eyes half-closed, but no longer sleepy.</p><p>There was no physical resemblance. Joe was stocky and bearlike; this Ishmael slender and lean, though the swell of muscle over the curve of his shoulder suggested considerable strength.</p><p>Joe\u2019s face was broad and amiable; this man\u2019s narrow and wary-eyed, with a high forehead that made his tribal scars the more striking. Joe\u2019s skin was the color of fresh coffee, Ishmael\u2019s the deep red-black of a burning ember, which Stern had told me was characteristic of slaves from the Guinea coast\u2014not so highly prized as the blue-black Senegalese, but more valuable than the yellow-brown Yaga and Congolese.</p><p>But if I closed my eyes entirely, I could hear Joe\u2019s voice speaking, even allowing for the faint Caribbean lilt of slave-English. I cracked my eyelids and looked carefully, searching for any signs of resemblance. There were none, but I did see what I had seen before, and not noticed, among the other scars and marks on the man\u2019s battered torso. What I had thought merely a scrape was in fact a deep abrasion that overlay a wide, flat scar, cut in the form of a rough square just below the point of the shoulder. The mark was raw and pink, newly healed. I should have seen it at once, if not for the darkness of the orlop, and the scrape that obscured it.</p><p>I lay quite still, trying to remember. \u201cNo slave name,\u201d Joe had said derisively, referring to his son\u2019s self-christening. Clearly, Ishmael had cut away an owner\u2019s brand, to prevent identification, should he be recaptured. But whose? And surely the name Ishmael was no more than coincidence.</p><p>Maybe not so farfetched a one, though; \u201cIshmael\u201d almost certainly wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s real name. \u201cThey be callin\u2019 me Ishmael,\u201d he had said. That, too, was a slave name, given him by one owner or another. And if young Lenny had been climbing his family tree, as it seemed, what more likely than that he should have chosen one of his ancestors\u2019 given names in symbol? If. But if he was...</p><p>I lay looking up at the claustrophobic ceiling of the berth, suppositions spinning through my head. Whether this man had any link with Joe or not, the possibility had reminded me of something.</p><p>Jamie was catechizing the man about the personnel and structure of the Bruja\u2014for so the ship that had attacked us had been\u2014but I was paying no attention. I sat up, cautiously, so as not to make the dizziness worse, and signaled to Fergus.</p><p>\u201cI need air,\u201d I said. \u201cHelp me up on deck, will you?\u201d Jamie glanced at me with a hint of worry, but I smiled reassuringly at him, and took Fergus\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the papers for that slave we bought on Barbados?\u201d I demanded, as soon as we were out of earshot of the cabin. \u201cAnd where\u2019s the slave, for that matter?\u201d</p><p>Fergus looked at me curiously, but obligingly rummaged in his coat.</p><p>\u201cI have the papers here, milady,\u201d he said, handing them to me. \u201cAs for the slave, I believe he is in the crew\u2019s quarters. Why?\u201d he added, unable to restrain his curiosity.</p><p>I ignored the question, fumbling through the grubby, repellent bits of paper.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d I said, finding the bit I remembered Jamie reading to me. \u201cAbernathy! It was Abernathy! Branded on the left shoulder with a fleur-de-lys. Did you notice that mark, Fergus?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking mildly bewildered.</p><p>\u201cNo, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come with me,\u201d I said, turning toward the crew\u2019s quarters. \u201cI want to see how big it is.\u201d</p><p>The mark was about three inches long and three wide; a flower, surmounting the initial \u201cA,\u201d burned into the skin a few inches below the point of the shoulder. It was the right size, and in the right place, to match the scar on the man Ishmael. It wasn\u2019t, however, a fleur-de-lys; that had been the mistake of a careless transcriber. It was a sixteen-petaled rose\u2014the Jacobite emblem of Charles Stuart. I blinked at it in amazement; what patriotic exile had chosen this bizarre method of maintaining allegiance to the vanquished Stuarts?</p><p>\u201cMilady, I think you should return to your bed,\u201d Fergus said. He was frowning at me as I stooped over Temeraire, who bore this inspection as stolidly as everything else. \u201cYou are the color of goose turds, and milord will not like it at all if I allow you to fall down on the deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fall down,\u201d I assured him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what color I am. I think we\u2019ve just had a stroke of luck. Listen, Fergus, I want you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, milady,\u201d he said, grabbing me by the elbow as a shift in the wind sent me staggering across the suddenly tilting deck. \u201cBut not,\u201d he added firmly, \u201cuntil you are safely back in your bed.\u201d</p><p>I allowed him to lead me back to the cabin, for I really didn\u2019t feel at all well, but not before giving him my instructions. As we entered the cabin, Jamie stood up from the table to greet us.</p><p>\u201cThere ye are, Sassenach! Are ye all right?\u201d he asked, frowning down at me. \u201cYe\u2019ve gone a nasty color, like a spoilt custard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am perfectly fine,\u201d I said, through my teeth, easing myself down on the bunk to avoid jarring my arm. \u201cHave you and Mr. Ishmael finished your conversation?\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at the prisoner, and I saw the flat black gaze that locked with his. The atmosphere between them was not hostile, but it was charged in some way. Jamie nodded in dismissal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve finished\u2014for the moment,\u201d he said. He turned to Fergus. \u201cSee our guest below, will ye, Fergus, and see to it that he\u2019s fed and clothed?\u201d He remained standing until Ishmael had left under Fergus\u2019s wing. Then he sat down beside my berth and squinted into the darkness at me.</p><p>\u201cYe look awful,\u201d he said. \u201cHad I best fetch your kit and be feeding ye a wee tonic or somesuch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cJamie, listen\u2014I think I know where our friend Ishmael came from.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one brow.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>I explained about the scar on Ishmael, and the almost matching brand on the slave Temeraire, without mentioning what had given me the idea in the first place.</p><p>\u201cFive will get you ten that they came from the same place\u2014from this Mrs. Abernathy\u2019s, on Jamaica.\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFive will...? Och,\u201d he said, waving away my confusing reference in the interests of continuing the discussion. \u201cWell, ye could be right, Sassenach, and I hope so. The wily black bastard wouldna say where he was from. Not that I can blame him,\u201d he added fairly. \u201cGod, if I\u2019d got away from such a life, there\u2019s no power on earth would take me back!\u201d He spoke with a surprising vehemence.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t blame him either,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what did he tell you, about the boys? Has he seen Young Ian?\u201d</p><p>The frowning lines of his face relaxed.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m almost sure he has.\u201d One fist curled on his knee in anticipation. \u201cTwo of the lads he described could be Ian. And knowin\u2019 it was the Bruja, I canna think otherwise. And if you\u2019re right about where he\u2019s come from, Sassenach, we might have him\u2014we may find him at last!\u201d Ishmael, while refusing to give any clue as to where the Bruja had picked him up, had gone so far as to say that the twelve boys\u2014all prisoners\u2014had been taken off the ship together, soon after his own capture.</p><p>\u201cTwelve lads,\u201d Jamie repeated, his momentary look of excitement fading back into a frown. \u201cWhat in the name of God would someone be wanting, to kidnap twelve lads from Scotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s a collector,\u201d I said, feeling more light-headed by the moment. \u201cCoins, and gems, and Scottish boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe think whoever\u2019s got Ian has the treasure as well?\u201d He glanced curiously at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, feeling suddenly very tired. I yawned rackingly. \u201cWe may know for sure about Ishmael, though. I told Fergus to see that Temeraire gets a look at him. If they are from the same place...\u201d I yawned again, my body seeking the oxygen that loss of blood had deprived me of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s verra sensible of ye, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, sounding faintly surprised that I was capable of sense. For that matter, I was a little surprised myself; my thoughts were becoming more fragmented by the moment, and it was an effort to keep talking logically.</p><p>Jamie saw it; he patted my hand and stood up.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna trouble yourself about it now, Sassenach. Rest, and I\u2019ll send Marsali down wi\u2019 some tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhisky,\u201d I said, and he laughed.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, then, whisky,\u201d he agreed. He smoothed my hair back, and leaning into the berth, kissed my hot forehead.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cLots.\u201d I smiled back and closed my eyes.</p><p>56</p><p>TURTLE SOUP</p> <p>When I woke again, in the late afternoon, I ached all over. I had thrown off the covers in my sleep, and lay sprawled in my shift, my skin hot and dry in the soft air. My arm ached abominably, and I could feel each of Mr. Willoughby\u2019s forty-three elegant stitches like red-hot safety pins stuck through my flesh.</p><p>No help for it; I was going to have to use the penicillin. I might be proof against smallpox, typhoid, and the common cold in its eighteenth-century incarnation, but I wasn\u2019t immortal, and God only knew what insanitary substances the Portuguese had been employing his cutlass on before applying it to me.</p><p>The short trip across the room to the cupboard where my clothes hung left me sweating and shivering, and I had to sit down quite suddenly, the skirt clutched to my bosom, in order to avoid falling.</p><p>\u201cSassenach! Are ye all right?\u201d Jamie poked his head through the low doorway, looking worried.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cCome here a minute, will you? I need you to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine? A biscuit? Murphy\u2019s made a wee broth for ye, special.\u201d He was beside me in a moment, the back of his hand cool against my flushed cheek. \u201cGod, you\u2019re burning!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though; I have medicine for it.\u201d</p><p>I fumbled one-handed in the pocket of the skirt, and pulled out the case containing the syringes and ampules. My right arm was sore enough that any movement made me clench my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d I said wryly, shoving the case across the table toward Jamie. \u201cHere\u2019s your chance for revenge, if you want it.\u201d</p><p>He looked blankly at the case, then at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said. \u201cYe want me to stab ye with one of these spikes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t put it quite that way, but yes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIn the bum?\u201d His lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cYes, damn you!\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me for a moment, one corner of his mouth curling slightly upward. Then he bowed his head over the case, red hair glowing in the shaft of sun from the window.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>I directed him carefully, guiding him through the preparation and filling of the syringe, and then took it myself, checking for air bubbles, clumsily left-handed. By the time I had given it back to him and arranged myself on the berth, he had ceased to find anything faintly funny about the situation.</p><p>\u201cAre ye sure ye want me to do it?\u201d he said doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019m no verra good with my hands.\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh, in spite of my throbbing arm. I had seen him do everything with those hands, from delivering foals and building walls, to skinning deer and setting type, all with the same light and dextrous touch.</p><p>\u201cWell, aye,\u201d he said, when I said as much. \u201cBut it\u2019s no quite the same, is it? The closest thing I\u2019ve done to this is to dirk a man in the wame, and it feels a bit strange to think of doin\u2019 such a thing to you, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back over my shoulder, to find him gnawing dubiously on his lower lip, the brandy-soaked pad in one hand, the syringe held gingerly in the other.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cI did it to you; you know what it feels like. It wasn\u2019t that bad, was it?\u201d He was beginning to make me rather nervous.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Pressing his lips together, he knelt down by the bed and gently wiped a spot on my backside with the cool, wet pad. \u201cIs this all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Press the point in at a bit of an angle, not straight in\u2014you see how the point of the needle\u2019s cut at an angle? Push it in about a quarter-inch\u2014don\u2019t be afraid to jab a bit, skin\u2019s tougher than you think to get through\u2014and then push down the plunger very slowly, you don\u2019t want to do it too fast.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and waited. After a moment, I opened them and looked back. He was pale, and a faint sheen of sweat glimmered over his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d I heaved myself upright, bracing against the wave of dizziness. \u201cHere, give me that.\u201d I snatched the pad from his hand and swiped a patch across the top of my thigh. My hand trembled slightly from the fever.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I took the syringe and aimed it as well as I could, left-handed, then plunged it into the muscle. It hurt. It hurt more when I pressed down on the plunger, and my thumb slipped off.</p><p>Then Jamie\u2019s hands were there, one steadying my leg, the other on the needle, slowly pressing down until the last of the white liquid had vanished from the tube. I took one quick, deep breath when he pulled it out.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly, a minute later. His hand came behind my back, easing me down.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d My eyes were closed, and there were little colored patterns on the inside of my eyelids. They reminded me of the lining of a doll\u2019s suitcase I had had as a child; tiny pink and silver stars on a dark background. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten; it\u2019s hard to do it the first few times. I suppose sticking a dirk in someone is easier,\u201d I added. \u201cYou aren\u2019t worried about hurting them, after all.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but exhaled rather strongly through his nose. I could hear him moving about the room, putting the case of syringes away and hanging up my skirt. The site of the injection felt like a knot under my skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye should,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cIt is easier to kill someone to save your own life than it is to hurt someone to save theirs. Ye\u2019re a deal braver than I am, and I dinna mind your saying so.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at me, blue eyes narrowed. The corner of his mouth turned up.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>I laughed, but it hurt my arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, and you aren\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t mean it that way, anyway,\u201d I said, and closed my eyes again.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the thump of feet on the deck above, and Mr. Warren\u2019s voice, raised in organized impatience. We had passed Great Abaco and Eleuthera in the night, and were now headed south toward Jamaica, with the wind behind us.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t risk being shot and hacked at, and arrested and hanged, if there were any choice about it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNeither would I,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d I began, and then stopped. I looked at him curiously. \u201cYou really think that,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThat you don\u2019t have a choice about it. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He was turned slightly away from me, eyes fixed on the port. The sun shone on the bridge of his long, straight nose and he rubbed a finger slowly up and down it. The broad shoulders rose slightly, and fell.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man, Sassenach,\u201d he said, very softly. \u201cIf I thought there was a choice...then I maybe couldna do it. Ye dinna need to be so brave about things if ye ken ye canna help it, aye?\u201d He looked at me then, with a faint smile. \u201cLike a woman in childbirth, aye? Ye must do it, and it makes no difference if you\u2019re afraid\u2014ye\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s only when ye ken ye can say no that it takes courage.\u201d</p><p>I lay quiet for a bit, watching him. He had closed his eyes and leaned back in the chair, auburn lashes long and absurdly childish against his cheeks. They contrasted strangely with the smudges beneath his eyes and the deeper lines at the corners. He was tired; he\u2019d barely slept since the sighting of the pirate vessel.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told you about Graham Menzies, have I?\u201d I said at last. The blue eyes opened at once.</p><p>\u201cNo. Who was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA patient. At the hospital in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Graham had been in his late sixties when I knew him; a Scottish immigrant who hadn\u2019t lost his burr, despite nearly forty years in Boston. He was a fisherman, or had been; when I knew him he owned several lobster boats, and let others do the fishing for him.</p><p>He was a lot like the Scottish soldiers I had known at Prestonpans and Falkirk; stoic and humorous at once, willing to joke about anything that was too painful to suffer in silence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be careful, now, lassie,\u201d was the last thing he said to me as I watched the anesthetist set up the intravenous drip that would maintain him while I amputated his cancerous left leg. \u201cBe sure ye\u2019re takin\u2019 off the right one, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I assured him, patting the weathered hand that lay on the sheet. \u201cI\u2019ll get the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe will?\u201d His eyes widened in simulated horror. \u201cI thought \u2019twas the left one was bad!\u201d He was still chuckling asthmatically as the gas mask came down over his face.</p><p>The amputation had gone well, and Graham had recovered and gone home, but I was not really surprised to see him back again, six months later. The lab report on the original tumor had been dubious, and the doubts were now substantiated; metastasis to the lymph nodes in the groin.</p><p>I removed the cancerous nodes. Radiation treatment was applied. Cobalt. I removed the spleen, to which the disease had spread, knowing that the surgery was entirely in vain, but not willing to give up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier not to give up, when it isn\u2019t you that\u2019s sick,\u201d I said, staring up at the timbers overhead.</p><p>\u201cDid he give up, then?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d call it that, exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking,\u201d Graham announced. The sound of his voice echoed tinnily through the earpieces of my stethoscope.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d I said. \u201cWell, don\u2019t do it out loud \u2019til I\u2019ve finished here, that\u2019s a good lad.\u201d</p><p>He gave a brief snort of laughter, but lay quietly as I auscultated his chest, moving the disc of the stethoscope swiftly from ribs to sternum.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said at last, slipping the tubes out of my ears and letting them fall over my shoulders. \u201cWhat have you been thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine straight on, with just a hint of challenge. I glanced behind me, to be sure that the nurse had left, then pulled up the blue plastic visitor\u2019s chair and sat down next to him.</p><p>\u201cPain getting bad?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere are things we can do, you know. You only need to ask.\u201d I hesitated before adding the last; he never had asked. Even when it was obvious that he needed medication, he never mentioned his discomfort. To mention it myself seemed an invasion of his privacy; I saw the small tightening at the corners of his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve a daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd two grandsons; bonny lads. But I\u2019m forgetting; you\u2019ll have seen them last week, aye?\u201d</p><p>I had. They came at least twice a week to see him, bringing scribbled school papers and autographed baseballs to show their grandpa.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s my mother, living up to the rest home on Canterbury,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cIt costs dearly, that place, but it\u2019s clean, and the food\u2019s good enough she enjoys complainin\u2019 about it while she eats.\u201d</p><p>He glanced dispassionately at the flat bedsheet, and lifted his stump.</p> <p>\u201cA month, d\u2019ye think? Four? Three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe three,\u201d I said. \u201cWith luck,\u201d I added idiotically.</p><p>He snorted at me, and jerked his head at the IV drip above him.</p><p>\u201cTcha! And worse luck I wouldna wish on a beggar.\u201d He looked around at all the paraphernalia; the automatic respirator, the blinking cardiac monitor, the litter of medical technology. \u201cNearly a hundred dollars a day it\u2019s costing, to keep me here,\u201d he said. \u201cThree months, that would be\u2014great heavens, ten thousand dollars!\u201d He shook his head, frowning.</p><p>\u201cA bad bargain, I call that. Not worth it.\u201d His pale gray eyes twinkled suddenly up at me. \u201cI\u2019m Scots, ye know. Born thrifty, and not likely to get over it now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I did it for him,\u201d I said, still staring upward. \u201cOr rather, we did it together. He was prescribed morphia for the pain\u2014that\u2019s like laudanum, only much stronger. I drew off half of each ampule and replaced the missing bit with water. It meant he didn\u2019t get the relief of a full dose for nearly twenty-four hours, but that was the safest way to get a big dose with no risk of being found out.</p><p>\u201cWe talked about using one of the botanical medicines I was studying; I knew enough to make up something fatal, but I wasn\u2019t sure of it being painless, and he didn\u2019t want to risk me being accused, if anyone got suspicious and did a forensic examination.\u201d I saw Jamie\u2019s eyebrow lift, and flapped a hand. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s a way of finding out how someone died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Like a coroner\u2019s court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit. Anyway, he\u2019d be supposed to have morphia in his blood; that wouldn\u2019t prove anything. So that\u2019s what we did.\u201d</p><p>I drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThere would have been no trouble, if I\u2019d given him the injection, and left. That\u2019s what he\u2019d asked me to do.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie was quiet, eyes fixed intently on me.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do it, though.\u201d I looked at my left hand, seeing not my own smooth flesh, but the big, swollen knuckles of a commercial fisherman, and the fat green veins that crossed his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI got the needle in,\u201d I said. I rubbed a finger over the spot on the wrist, where a large vein crosses the distal head of the radius. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t press down the plunger.\u201d</p><p>In memory, I saw Graham Menzies\u2019s other hand rise from his side, trailing tubes, and close over my own. He hadn\u2019t much strength, then, but enough.</p><p>\u201cI sat there until he was gone, holding his hand.\u201d I felt it still, the steady beat of the wrist-pulse under my thumb, growing slower, and slower still, as I held his hand, and then waiting for a beat that did not come.</p><p>I looked up at Jamie, shaking off the memory.</p><p>\u201cAnd then a nurse came in.\u201d It had been one of the younger nurses\u2014an excitable girl, with no discretion. She wasn\u2019t very experienced, but knew enough to tell a dead man when she saw one. And me just sitting there, doing nothing\u2014most undoctorlike conduct. And the empty morphia syringe, lying on the table beside me.</p><p>\u201cShe talked, of course,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI expect she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the presence of mind to drop the syringe into the incinerator chute after she left, though. It was her word against mine, and the whole matter was just dismissed.\u201d</p><p>My mouth twisted wryly. \u201cExcept that the next week, they offered me a job as head of the whole department. Very important. A lovely office on the sixth floor of the hospital\u2014safely away from the patients, where I couldn\u2019t murder anyone else.\u201d</p><p>My finger was still rubbing absently across my wrist. Jamie reached out and stopped it by laying his own hand over mine.</p><p>\u201cWhen was this, Sassenach?\u201d he asked, his voice very gentle.</p><p>\u201cJust before I took Bree and went to Scotland. That\u2019s why I went, in fact; they gave me an extended leave\u2014said I\u2019d been working too hard, and deserved a nice vacation.\u201d I didn\u2019t try to keep the irony out of my voice.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d His hand was warm on mine, despite the heat of my fever. \u201cIf it hadna been for that, for losing your work\u2014would ye have come, Sassenach? Not just to Scotland. To me?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him and squeezed his hand, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI really don\u2019t. If I hadn\u2019t come to Scotland, met Roger Wakefield, found out that you\u2014\u201d I stopped and swallowed, overwhelmed. \u201cIt was Graham who sent me to Scotland,\u201d I said at last, feeling slightly choked. \u201cHe asked me to go someday\u2014and say hello to Aberdeen for him.\u201d I glanced up at Jamie suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t! I never did go to Aberdeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna trouble yourself, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie squeezed my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take ye there myself\u2014when we go back. Not,\u201d he added practically, \u201cthat there\u2019s anything to see there.\u201d</p><p>It was growing stuffy in the cabin. He rose and went to open one of the stern windows.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said, watching his back, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>He glanced around, frowning slightly in thought.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014an orange would be good,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some in the desk, aye?\u201d Without waiting for a reply, he rolled back the lid of the desk, revealing a small bowl of oranges, bright among the litter of quills and papers. \u201cD\u2019ye want one, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t really what I meant, though. I meant\u2014what do you want to do, once we\u2019ve found Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He sat down by the berth, an orange in his hands, and stared at it for a moment.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye know,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI dinna think anyone has ever asked me that\u2014what it was I wanted to do.\u201d He sounded mildly surprised.</p><p>\u201cNot as though you very often had a choice about it, is it?\u201d I said dryly. \u201cNow you do, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true.\u201d He rolled the orange between his palms, head bent over the dimpled sphere. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s come to ye that we likely canna go back to Scotland\u2014at least for a time?\u201d he said. I had told him of Tompkins\u2019s revelations about Sir Percival and his machinations, of course, but we had had little time to discuss the matter\u2014or its implications.</p><p>\u201cIt has,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet then, letting him come to terms with it. He had lived as an outlaw for a good many years, hiding first physically, and then by means of secrecy and aliases, eluding the law by slipping from one identity to another. But now all these were known; there was no way for him to resume any of his former activities\u2014or even to appear in public in Scotland.</p><p>His final refuge had always been Lallybroch. But even that avenue of retreat was lost to him now. Lallybroch would always be his home, but it was no longer his; there was a new laird now. I knew he would not begrudge the fact that Jenny\u2019s family possessed the estate\u2014but he must, if he were human, regret the loss of his heritage.</p><p>I could hear his faint snort, and thought he had probably reached the same point in his thinking that I had in mine.</p><p>\u201cNot Jamaica or the English-owned islands, either,\u201d he observed ruefully. \u201cTom Leonard and the Royal Navy may think us both dead for the moment, but they\u2019ll be quick enough to notice otherwise if we stay for any length of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought of America?\u201d I asked this delicately. \u201cThe Colonies, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his nose doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, no. I hadna really thought of it. It\u2019s true we\u2019d likely be safe from the Crown there, but...\u201d He trailed off, frowning. He picked up his dirk and scored the orange, quickly and neatly, then began to peel it.</p><p>\u201cNo one would be hunting you there,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cSir Percival hasn\u2019t got any interest in you, unless you\u2019re in Scotland, where arresting you would do him some good. The British Navy can\u2019t very well follow you ashore, and the West Indian governors haven\u2019t anything to say about what goes on in the Colonies, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut the Colonies...\u201d He took the peeled orange in one hand, and began to toss it lightly, a few inches in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s verra primitive, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cA wilderness, aye? I shouldna like to take ye into danger.\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh, and he glanced sharply at me, then, catching my thought, relaxed into a half-rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I suppose draggin\u2019 ye off to sea and letting ye be kidnapped and locked up in a plague ship is dangerous enough. But at least I havena let ye be eaten by cannibals, yet.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to laugh again, but there was a bitter note to his voice that made me bite my lip instead.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any cannibals in America,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThere are!\u201d he said heatedly. \u201cI printed a book for a society of Catholic missionaries, that told all about the heathen Iroquois in the north. They tie up their captives and chop bits off of them, and then rip out their hearts and eat them before their eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat the hearts first and then the eyes, do they?\u201d I said, laughing in spite of myself. \u201cAll right,\u201d I said, seeing his scowl, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But for one thing, you can\u2019t believe everything you read, and for another\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get to finish. He leaned forward and grasped my good arm, tight enough to make me squeak with surprise.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, listen to me!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no light matter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...no, I suppose not,\u201d I said, tentatively. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make fun of you\u2014but, Jamie, I did live in Boston for nearly twenty years. You\u2019ve never set foot in America!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cAnd d\u2019ye think the place ye lived in is anything like what it\u2019s like now, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I began, then paused. While I had seen any number of historic buildings near Boston Common, sporting little brass plaques attesting to their antiquity, the majority of them had been built later than 1770; many a lot later. And beyond a few buildings...</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d I admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s not; I know it\u2019s not. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a complete wilderness. There are cities and towns now; I know that much.\u201d</p><p>He let go of my arm and sat back. He still held the orange in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s so,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cYe dinna hear so much of the towns\u2014only that it\u2019s such a wild savage place, though verra beautiful. But I\u2019m no a fool, Sassenach.\u201d His voice sharpened slightly, and he dug his thumb savagely into the orange, splitting it in half. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI dinna believe something only because someone\u2019s set words down in a book\u2014for God\u2019s sake, I print the damn things!

And surely I ken the difference between a romance and a fact set down in cold blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. \u201cThough I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s all that easy to tell the difference between romance and fact in print. But even if it\u2019s dead true about the Iroquois, the whole continent isn\u2019t swarming with bloodthirsty savages. I do know that much. It\u2019s a very big place, you know,\u201d I added, gently.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said, plainly unconvinced. Still, he bent his attention to the orange, and began to divide it into segments.</p><p>\u201cThis is very funny,\u201d I said ruefully. \u201cWhen I made up my mind to come back, I read everything I could find about England and Scotland and France about this time, so I\u2019d know as much as I could about what to expect. And here we end up in a place I know nothing about, because it never dawned on me we\u2019d cross the ocean, with you being so seasick.\u201d</p> <p>That made him laugh, a little grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, ye never ken what ye can do \u2019til ye have to. Believe me, Sassenach, once I\u2019ve got Ian safely back, I shall never set foot on a filthy, godforsaken floating plank in my life again\u2014except to go home to Scotland, when it\u2019s safe,\u201d he added, as an afterthought. He offered me an orange segment and I took it, token of a peace offering.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Scotland, you still have your printing press there, safe in Edinburgh,\u201d I said. \u201cWe could have it sent over, maybe\u2014if we settled in one of the larger American cities.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at that, startled.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think it would be possible to earn a living, printing? There are that many people? It takes a fair-sized city, ye ken, to need a printer or bookseller.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you could. Boston, Philadelphia...not New York yet, I don\u2019t think. Williamsburg, maybe? I don\u2019t know which ones, but there are several places big enough to need printing\u2014the shipping ports, certainly.\u201d I remembered the flapping posters, advertising dates of embarkation and arrival, sales of goods and recruitment of seamen, that decorated the walls of every seaside tavern in Le Havre.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d This one was a thoughtful noise. \u201cAye, well, if we might do that...\u201d</p><p>He poked a piece of fruit into his mouth and ate it slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>I glanced at him, startled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were fixed intently on me, reading my face.</p><p>\u201cWould it suit ye to go to such a place?\u201d He looked down then, carefully separating the other half of the fruit. \u201cI mean\u2014you\u2019ve your work to do as well, aye?\u201d He looked up and smiled, wryly.</p><p>\u201cI learned in Paris that I couldna stop ye doing it. And ye said yourself, ye might not have come, had Menzies\u2019s death not stopped you, where ye were. Can ye be a healer in the Colonies, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect I can,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThere are people sick and injured, almost anywhere you go, after all.\u201d I looked at him, curious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very odd man, Jamie Fraser.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, and swallowed the rest of his orange.</p><p>\u201cOh, I am, aye? And what d\u2019ye mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrank loved me,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cBut there were...pieces of me, that he didn\u2019t know what to do with. Things about me that he didn\u2019t understand, or maybe that frightened him.\u201d I glanced at Jamie. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p> <p>His head was bent over a second orange, hands moving swiftly as he scored it with his dirk, but I could see the faint smile in the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sassenach, ye dinna frighten me. Or rather ye do, but only when I think ye may kill yourself from carelessness.\u201d</p><p>I snorted briefly.</p><p>\u201cYou scare me, for the same reason, but I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything I can do about it.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was deep and easy.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye think I canna do anything about it, either, so I shouldna be worrit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t worry\u2014do you think I don\u2019t worry? But no, you probably can\u2019t do anything about me.\u201d</p><p>I saw him opening his mouth to disagree. Then he changed his mind, and laughed again. He reached out and popped an orange segment into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe no, Sassenach, and maybe so. But I\u2019ve lived a long enough time now to think it maybe doesna matter so much\u2014so long as I can love you.\u201d</p><p>Speechless with orange juice, I stared at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do,\u201d he said softly. He leaned into the berth and kissed me, his mouth warm and sweet. Then he drew back, and gently touched my cheek.</p><p>\u201cRest now,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll bring ye some broth, in a bit.\u201d</p><p>I slept for several hours, and woke up still feverish, but hungry. Jamie brought me some of Murphy\u2019s broth\u2014a rich green concoction, swimming in butter and reeking with sherry\u2014and insisted, despite my protests, on feeding it to me with a spoon.</p><p>\u201cI have a perfectly good hand,\u201d I said crossly.</p><p>\u201cAye, and I\u2019ve seen ye use it, too,\u201d he replied, deftly gagging me with the spoon. \u201cIf ye\u2019re clumsy with a spoon as wi\u2019 that needle, you\u2019ll have this all spilt down your bosom and wasted, and Murphy will brain me wi\u2019 the ladle. Here, open up.\u201d</p><p>I did, my resentment gradually melting into a sort of warm and glowing stupor as I ate. I hadn\u2019t taken anything for the pain in my arm, but as my empty stomach expanded in grateful relief, I more or less quit noticing it.</p><p>\u201cWill ye have another bowl?\u201d Jamie asked, as I swallowed the last spoonful. \u201cYe\u2019ll need your strength kept up.\u201d Not waiting for an answer, he uncovered the small tureen Murphy had sent, and refilled the bowl.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ishmael?\u201d I asked, during the brief hiatus.</p><p>\u201cOn the after deck. He didna seem comfortable belowdecks\u2014and I canna say I blame him, having seen the slavers at Bridgetown. I had Maitland sling him a hammock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe to leave him loose like that? What kind of soup is this?\u201d The last spoonful had left a delightful, lingering taste on my tongue; the next revived the full flavor.</p><p>\u201cTurtle; Stern took a big hawksbill last night. He sent word he\u2019s saving ye the shell to make combs of, for your hair.\u201d Jamie frowned slightly, whether at the thought of Lawrence Stern\u2019s gallantry or Ishmael\u2019s presence, I couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cAs for the black, he\u2019s not loose\u2014Fergus is watching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFergus is on his honeymoon,\u201d I protested. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make him do it. Is this really turtle soup? I\u2019ve never had it before. It\u2019s marvelous.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was unmoved by contemplation of Fergus\u2019s tender state.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, he\u2019ll be wed a long time,\u201d he said callously. \u201cDo him no harm to keep his breeches on for one night. And they do say that abstinence makes the heart grow firmer, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsence,\u201d I said, dodging the spoon for a moment. \u201cAnd fonder. If anything\u2019s growing firmer from abstinence, it wouldn\u2019t be his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s verra bawdy talk for a respectable marrit woman,\u201d Jamie said reprovingly, sticking the spoon in my mouth. \u201cAnd inconsiderate, forbye.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cInconsiderate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a wee bit firm myself at the moment,\u201d he replied evenly, dipping and spooning. \u201cWhat wi\u2019 you sitting there wi\u2019 your hair loose and your ni**les starin\u2019 me in the eye, the size of cherries.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down involuntarily, and the next spoonful bumped my nose. Jamie clicked his tongue, and picking up a cloth, briskly blotted my bosom with it. It was quite true that my shift was made of thin cotton, and even when dry, reasonably easy to see through.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though you haven\u2019t seen them before,\u201d I said, amused.</p><p>He laid down the cloth and raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cI have drunk water every day since I was weaned,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt doesna mean I canna be thirsty, still.\u201d He picked up the spoon. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a wee bit more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I said, dodging the oncoming spoon. \u201cI want to hear more about this firmness of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ye don\u2019t; you\u2019re ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel much better,\u201d I assured him. \u201cShall I have a look at it?\u201d He was wearing the loose petticoat breeches the sailors wore, in which he could easily have concealed three or four dead mullet, let alone a fugitive firmness.</p><p>\u201cYou shall not,\u201d he said, looking slightly shocked. \u201cSomeone might come in. And I canna think your looking at it would help a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t tell that until I have looked at it, can you?\u201d I said. \u201cBesides, you can bolt the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBolt the door? What d\u2019ye think I\u2019m going to do? Do I look the sort of man would take advantage of a woman who\u2019s not only wounded and boiling wi\u2019 fever, but drunk as well?\u201d he demanded. He stood up, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cI am not drunk,\u201d I said indignantly. \u201cYou can\u2019t get drunk on turtle soup!\u201d Nonetheless, I was conscious that the glowing warmth in my stomach seemed to have migrated somewhat lower, taking up residence between my thighs, and there was undeniably a slight lightness of head not strictly attributable to fever.</p><p>\u201cYou can if ye\u2019ve been drinking turtle soup as made by Aloysius O\u2019Shaughnessy Murphy,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the smell of it, he\u2019s put at least a full bottle o\u2019 the sherry in it. A verra intemperate race, the Irish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m still not drunk.\u201d I straightened up against the pillows as best I could. \u201cYou told me once that if you could still stand up, you weren\u2019t drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t standing up,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou are. And I could if I wanted to. Stop trying to change the subject. We were talking about your firmness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye can just stop talking about it, because\u2014\u201d He broke off with a small yelp, as I made a fortunate grab with my left hand.</p><p>\u201cClumsy, am I?\u201d I said, with considerable satisfaction. \u201cOh, my. Heavens, you do have a problem, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill ye leave go of me?\u201d he hissed, looking frantically over his shoulder at the door. \u201cSomeone could come in any moment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you you should have bolted the door,\u201d I said, not letting go. Far from being a dead mullet, the object in my hand was exhibiting considerable liveliness.</p><p>He eyed me narrowly, breathing through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna use force on a sick woman,\u201d he said through his teeth, \u201cbut you\u2019ve a damn healthy grip for someone with a fever, Sassenach. If you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I felt better,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cbut I\u2019ll make you a bargain; you bolt the door and I\u2019ll prove I\u2019m not drunk.\u201d I rather regretfully let go, to indicate good faith. He stood staring at me for a moment, absentmindedly rubbing the site of my recent assault on his virtue. Then he lifted one ruddy eyebrow, turned, and went to bolt the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time he turned back, I had made it out of the berth and was standing\u2014a trifle shakily, but still upright\u2014against the frame. He eyed me critically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no going to work, Sassenach,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He looked rather regretful, himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll never stay upright, wi\u2019 a swell like there is underfoot tonight, and ye know I\u2019ll not fit in that berth by myself, let alone wi\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>There was a considerable swell; the lantern on its swivel-bracket hung steady and level, but the shelf above it tilted visibly back and forth as the Artemis rode the waves. I could feel the faint shudder of the boards under my bare feet, and knew Jamie was right. At least he was too absorbed in the discussion to be seasick.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always the floor,\u201d I suggested hopefully. He glanced down at the limited floor space and frowned. \u201cAye, well. There is, but we\u2019d have to do it like snakes, Sassenach, all twined round each other amongst the table legs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201cit would hurt your arm.\u201d He rubbed a knuckle across his lower lip, thinking. His eyes passed absently across my body at about hip level, returned, fixed, and lost their focus. I thought the bloody shift must be more transparent than I realized.</p><p>Deciding to take matters into my own hands, I let go my hold on the frame of the berth and lurched the two paces necessary to reach him. The roll of the ship threw me into his arms, and he barely managed to keep his own balance, clutching me tightly round the waist.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d he said, staggered, and then, as much from reflex as from desire, bent his head and kissed me.</p><p>It was startling. I was accustomed to be surrounded by the warmth of his embrace; now it was I who was hot to the touch and he who was cool. From his reaction, he was enjoying the novelty as much as I was.</p> <p>Light-headed, and reckless with it, I nipped the side of his neck with my teeth, feeling the waves of heat from my face pulsate against the column of his throat. He felt it, too.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re like holding a hot coal!\u201d His hands dropped lower and pressed me hard against him.</p><p>\u201cFirm is it? Ha,\u201d I said, getting my mouth free for a moment. \u201cTake those baggy things off.\u201d I slid down his length and onto my knees in front of him, fumbling mazily at his flies. He freed the laces with a quick jerk, and the petticoat breeches ballooned to the floor with a whiff of wind.</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for him to remove his shirt; just lifted it and took him. He made a strangled sound and his hands came down on my head as though he wanted to restrain me, but hadn\u2019t the strength.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord!\u201d he said. His hands tightened in my hair, but he wasn\u2019t trying to push me away. \u201cThis must be what it\u2019s like to make love in Hell,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWith a burning she-devil.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, which was extremely difficult under the circumstances. I choked, and pulled back a moment, breathless.</p> <p>\u201cIs this what a succubus does, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna doubt it for a moment,\u201d he assured me. His hands were still in my hair, urging me back.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door, and he froze. Confident that the door was indeed bolted, I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAye? What is it?\u201d he said, with a calmness rather remarkable for a man in his position.</p><p>\u201cFraser?\u201d Lawrence Stern\u2019s voice came through the door. \u201cThe Frenchman says the black is asleep, and may he have leave to go to bed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Jamie shortly. \u201cTell him to stay where he is; I\u2019ll come along and relieve him in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Stern\u2019s voice sounded a little hesitant. \u201cSurely. His...um, his wife seems...eager for him to come now.\u201d</p><p>Jamie inhaled sharply.</p> <p>\u201cTell her,\u201d he said, a small note of strain becoming evident in his voice, \u201cthat he\u2019ll be there...presently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will say so.\u201d Stern sounded dubious about Marsali\u2019s reception of this news, but then his voice brightened. \u201cAh...is Mrs. Fraser feeling somewhat improved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra much,\u201d said Jamie, with feeling.</p><p>\u201cShe enjoyed the turtle soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreatly. I thank ye.\u201d His hands on my head were trembling.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her that I\u2019ve put aside the shell for her? It was a fine hawksbill turtle; a most elegant beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Aye, I did.\u201d With an audible gasp, Jamie pulled away and reaching down, lifted me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Mr. Stern!\u201d he called. He pulled me toward the berth; we struggled four-legged to keep from crashing into tables and chairs as the floor rose and fell beneath us.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lawrence sounded faintly disappointed. \u201cI suppose Mrs. Fraser is asleep, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh, and I\u2019ll throttle ye,\u201d Jamie whispered fiercely in my ear. \u201cShe is, Mr. Stern,\u201d he called through the door. \u201cI shall give her your respects in the morning, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust she will rest well. There seems to be a certain roughness to the sea this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...have noticed, Mr. Stern.\u201d Pushing me to my knees in front of the berth, he knelt behind me, groping for the hem of my shift. A cool breeze from the open stern window blew over my naked bu**ocks, and a shiver ran down the backs of my thighs.</p><p>\u201cShould you or Mrs. Fraser find yourselves discommoded by the motion, I have a most capital remedy to hand\u2014a compound of mugwort, bat dung, and the fruit of the mangrove. You have only to ask, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t answer for a moment.</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ!\u201d he whispered. I took a sizable bite of the bedclothes.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, \u2018Thank you\u2019!\u201d Jamie replied, raising his voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, I shall bid you a good evening, then.\u201d</p><p>Jamie let out his breath in a long shudder that was not quite a moan.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Stern!\u201d Jamie bellowed.</p><p>\u201cOh! Er...good evening.\u201d</p><p>Stern\u2019s footsteps receded down the companionway, lost in the sound of the waves that were now crashing loudly against the hull. I spit out the mouthful of quilt.</p><p>\u201cOh...my...God!\u201d</p><p>His hands were large and hard and cool on my heated flesh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve the roundest arse I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d</p><p>A lurch by the Artemis here aiding his efforts to an untoward degree, I uttered a loud shriek.</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d He clasped a hand over my mouth, bending over me so that he lay over my back, the billowing linen of his shirt falling around me and the weight of him pressing me to the bed. My skin, crazed with fever, was sensitive to the slightest touch, and I shook in his arms, the heat inside me rushing outward as he moved within me.</p><p>His hands were under me then, clutching my br**sts, the only anchor as I lost my boundaries and dissolved, conscious thought a displaced element in the chaos of sensations\u2014the warm damp of tangled quilts beneath me, the cold sea wind and misty spray that wafted over us from the rough sea outside, the gasp and brush of Jamie\u2019s warm breath on the back of my neck, and the sudden prickle and flood of cold and heat, as my fever broke in a dew of satisfied desire.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s weight rested on my back, his thighs behind mine. It was warm, and comforting. After a long time, his breathing eased, and he rose off me. The thin cotton of my shift was damp, and the wind plucked it away from my skin, making me shiver.</p><p>Jamie closed the window with a snap, then bent and picked me up like a rag doll. He lowered me into the berth, and pulled the quilt up over me.</p><p>\u201cHow is your arm?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat arm?\u201d I murmured drowsily. I felt as though I had been melted and poured into a mold to set.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, a smile in his voice. \u201cCan ye stand up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for all the tea in China.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Murphy ye liked the soup.\u201d His hand rested for a moment on my cool forehead, passed down the curve of my cheek in a light caress, and then was gone. I didn\u2019t hear him leave.</p><p>57</p><p>PROMISED LAND</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s persecution!\u201d Jamie said indignantly. He stood behind me, looking over the rail of the Artemis. Kingston Harbor stretched to our left, glowing like liquid sapphires in the morning light, the town above half-sunk in jungle green, cubes of yellowed ivory and pink rose-quartz in a lush setting of emerald and malachite. And on the cerulean bosom of the water below floated the majestic sight of a great three-masted ship, furled canvas white as gull wings, gun decks proud and brass gleaming in the sun. His Majesty\u2019s man-of-war Porpoise.</p><p>\u201cThe filthy boat\u2019s pursuing me,\u201d he said, glaring at it as we sailed past at a discreet distance, well outside the harbor mouth. \u201cEverywhere I go, there it is again!\u201d</p><p>I laughed, though in truth, the sight of the Porpoise made me slightly nervous, too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s personal,\u201d I told him. \u201cCaptain Leonard did say they were bound for Jamaica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but why would they no head straight to Antigua, where the naval barracks and the navy shipyards are, and them in such straits as ye left them?\u201d He shaded his eyes, peering at the Porpoise. Even at this distance, small figures were visible in the rigging, making repairs.</p><p>\u201cThey had to come here first,\u201d I explained. \u201cThey were carrying a new governor for the colony.\u201d I felt an absurd urge to duck below the rail, though I knew that even Jamie\u2019s red hair would be indistinguishable at this distance.</p><p>\u201cAye? I wonder who\u2019s that?\u201d Jamie spoke absently; we were no more than an hour away from arrival at Jared\u2019s plantation on Sugar Bay, and I knew his mind was busy with plans for finding Young Ian.</p><p>\u201cA chap named Grey,\u201d I said, turning away from the rail. \u201cNice man; I met him on the ship, just briefly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrey?\u201d Startled, Jamie looked down at me. \u201cNot Lord John Grey, by chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that was his name? Why?\u201d I glanced up at him, curious. He was staring at the Porpoise with renewed interest.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He heard me when I repeated the question a second time, and glanced down at me, smiling. \u201cOh. It\u2019s only that I ken Lord John; he\u2019s a friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I was no more than mildly surprised. Jamie\u2019s friends had once included the French minister of finance and Charles Stuart, as well as Scottish beggars and French pickpockets. I supposed it was not remarkable that he should now count English aristocrats among his acquaintance, as well as Highland smugglers and Irish seacooks.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s luck,\u201d I said. \u201cOr at least I suppose it is. Where do you know Lord John from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the Governor of Ardsmuir prison,\u201d he replied, surprising me after all. His eyes were still fixed on the Porpoise, narrowed in speculation.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s a friend of yours?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand men.\u201d</p><p>He turned and smiled at me, taking his attention at last from the English ship.</p><p>\u201cWell, friends are where ye find them, Sassenach,\u201d he said. He squinted toward the shore, shading his eyes with his hand. \u201cLet us hope this Mrs. Abernathy proves to be one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As we rounded the tip of the headland, a lithe black figure materialized next to the rail. Now clothed in spare seaman\u2019s clothes, with his scars hidden, Ishmael looked less like a slave and a good deal more like a pirate. Not for the first time, I wondered just how much of what he had told us was the truth.</p><p>\u201cI be leavin\u2019 now,\u201d he announced abruptly.</p><p>Jamie lifted one eyebrow and glanced over the rail, into the soft blue depths.</p><p>\u201cDinna let me prevent ye,\u201d he said politely. \u201cBut would ye not rather have a boat?\u201d</p> <p>Something that might have been humor flickered briefly in the black man\u2019s eyes, but didn\u2019t disturb the severe outlines of his face.</p><p>\u201cYou say you put me ashore where I want, I be tellin\u2019 you \u2019bout those boys,\u201d he said. He nodded toward the island, where a riotous growth of jungle spilled down the slope of a hill to meet its own green shadow in the shallow water. \u201cThat be where I want.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked thoughtfully from the uninhabited shore to Ishmael, and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a boat lowered.\u201d He turned to go to the cabin. \u201cI promised ye gold as well, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be wantin\u2019 gold, mon.\u201d Ishmael\u2019s tone, as well as his words, stopped Jamie in his tracks. He looked at the black man with interest, mingled with a certain reserve.</p> <p>\u201cYe\u2019ll have something else in mind?\u201d</p><p>Ishmael jerked his head in a short nod. He didn\u2019t seem outwardly nervous, but I noticed the faint gleam of sweat on his temples, despite the mild noon breeze.</p><p>\u201cI be wantin\u2019 that one-arm nigger.\u201d He stared boldly at Jamie as he spoke, but there was a diffidence under the confident facade.</p><p>\u201cTemeraire?\u201d I blurted out in astonishment. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ishmael flicked a glance at me, but addressed his words to Jamie, half-bold, half-cajoling.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t no good to you, mon; can\u2019t be doin\u2019 field work or ship work neither, ain\u2019t got but one arm.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie didn\u2019t reply directly, but stared at Ishmael for a moment. Then he turned and called for Fergus to bring up the one-armed slave.</p><p>Temeraire, brought up on deck, stood expressionless as a block of wood, barely blinking in the sun. He too had been provided with seaman\u2019s clothes, but he lacked Ishmael\u2019s raffish elegance in them. He looked like a stump upon which someone had spread out washing to dry.</p><p>\u201cThis man wants you to go with him, to the island there,\u201d Jamie said to Temeraire, in slow, careful French. \u201cDo you want to do this thing?\u201d</p><p>Temeraire did blink at that, and a brief look of startlement widened his eyes. I supposed that no one had asked him what he wanted in many years\u2014if ever. He glanced warily from Jamie to Ishmael and back again, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Jamie tried again.</p><p>\u201cYou do not have to go with this man,\u201d he assured the slave. \u201cYou may come with us, and we will take care of you. No one will hurt you. But you can go with him, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Still the slave hesitated, eyes flicking right and left, clearly startled and disturbed by the unexpected choice. It was Ishmael who decided the matter. He said something, in a strange tongue full of liquid vowels and syllables that repeated like a drumbeat.</p><p>Temeraire let out a gasp, fell to his knees, and pressed his forehead to the deck at Ishmael\u2019s feet. Everyone on deck stared at him, then looked at Ishmael, who stood with arms folded with a sort of wary defiance.</p> <p>\u201cHe be goin\u2019 with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>And so it was. Picard rowed the two blacks ashore in the dinghy, and left them on the rocks at the edge of the jungle, supplied with a small bag of provisions, each equipped with a knife.</p><p>\u201cWhy there?\u201d I wondered aloud, watching the two small figures make their way slowly up the wooded slope. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any towns nearby, are there? Or any plantations?\u201d To the eye, the shore presented an unbroken expanse of jungle.</p><p>\u201cOh, there are plantations,\u201d Lawrence assured me. \u201cFar up in the hills; that\u2019s where they grow the coffee and indigo\u2014the sugarcane grows better near the coast.\u201d He squinted toward the shore, where the two dark figures had disappeared. \u201cIt is more likely that they have gone to join a band of Maroons, though,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere are Maroons on Jamaica as well as on Hispaniola?\u201d Fergus asked, interested.</p><p>Lawrence smiled, a little grimly.</p><p>\u201cThere are Maroons wherever there are slaves, my friend,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are always men who prefer to take the chance of dying like animals, rather than live as captives.\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned his head sharply to look at Lawrence, but said nothing.</p><p>Jared\u2019s plantation at Sugar Bay was called Blue Mountain House, presumably for the sake of the low, hazy peak that rose inland a mile behind it, blue with pines and distance. The house itself was set near the shore, in the shallow curve of the bay. In fact, the veranda that ran along one side of the house overhung a small lagoon, the building set on sturdy silvered-wood pilings that rose from the water, crusted with a spongy growth of tunicates and mussels and the fine green seaweed called mermaid\u2019s hair.</p><p>We were expected; Jared had sent a letter by a ship that left Le Havre a week before the Artemis. Owing to our delay on Hispaniola, the letter had arrived nearly a month in advance of ourselves, and the overseer and his wife\u2014a portly, comfortable Scottish couple named MacIvers\u2014were relieved to see us.</p><p>\u201cI thought surely the winter storms had got ye,\u201d Kenneth MacIver said for the fourth time, shaking his head. He was bald, the top of his head scaly and freckled from long years\u2019 exposure to the tropic sun. His wife was a plump, genial, grandmotherly soul\u2014who, I realized to my shock, was roughly five years younger than myself. She herded Marsali and me off for a quick wash, brush, and nap before supper, while Fergus and Jamie went with Mr. MacIver to direct the partial unloading of the Artemis\u2019s cargo and the disposition of her crew.</p><p>I was more than willing to go; while my arm had healed sufficiently to need no more than a light bandage, it had prevented me from bathing in the sea as was my usual habit. After a week aboard the Artemis, unbathed, I looked forward to fresh water and clean sheets with a longing that was almost hunger.</p><p>I had no landlegs yet; the worn wooden floorboards of the plantation house gave the disconcerting illusion of seeming to rise and fall beneath my feet, and I staggered down the hallway after Mrs. MacIver, bumping into walls.</p><p>The house had an actual bathtub in a small porch; wooden, but filled\u2014mirabile dictu!\u2014with hot water, by the good offices of two black slave women who heated kettles over a fire in the yard and carried them in. I should have felt much too guilty at this exploitation to enjoy my bath, but I didn\u2019t. I wallowed luxuriously, scrubbing the salt and grime from my skin with a loofah sponge and lathering my hair with a shampoo made from chamomile, geranium oil, fat-soap shavings, and the yolk of an egg, graciously supplied by Mrs. MacIver.</p><p>Smelling sweet, shiny-haired, and languid with warmth, I collapsed gratefully into the bed I was given. I had time only to think how delightful it was to stretch out at full length, before I fell asleep.</p><p>When I woke, the shadows of dusk were gathering on the veranda outside the open French doors of my bedroom, and Jamie lay naked beside me, hands folded on his belly, breathing deep and slow.</p><p>He felt me stir, and opened his eyes. He smiled sleepily and reaching up a hand, pulled me down to his mouth. He had had a bath, too; he smelled of soap and cedar needles. I kissed him at length, slowly and thoroughly, running my tongue across the wide curve of his lip, finding his tongue with mine in a soft, dark joust of greeting and invitation.</p><p>I broke loose, finally, and came up for air. The room was filled with a wavering green light, reflections from the lagoon outside, as though the room itself were underwater. The air was at once warm and fresh, smelling of sea and rain, with tiny currents of breeze that caressed the skin.</p><p>\u201cYe smell sweet, Sassenach,\u201d he murmured, voice husky with sleep. He smiled, reaching up to twine his fingers into my hair. \u201cCome here to me, curly-wig.\u201d</p><p>Freed from pins and freshly washed, my hair was clouding over my shoulders in a perfect explosion of Medusa-like curls. I reached up to smooth it back, but he tugged gently, bending me forward so the veil of brown and gold and silver fell loose over his face.</p><p>I kissed him, half-smothered in clouds of hair, and lowered myself to lie on top of him, letting the fullness of my br**sts squash gently against his chest. He moved slightly, rubbing, and sighed with pleasure.</p><p>His hands cupped my bu**ocks, trying to move me upward enough to enter me.</p><p>\u201cNot bloody yet,\u201d I whispered. I pressed my hips down, rolling them, enjoying the feel of the silky stiffness trapped beneath my belly. He made a small breathless sound.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had room or time to make love properly in months,\u201d I told him. \u201cSo we\u2019re taking our time about it now, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe take me at something of a disadvantage, Sassenach,\u201d he murmured into my hair. He squirmed under me, pressing upward urgently. \u201cYe dinna think we could take our time next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cNow. Slow. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>He made a sort of rumbling noise in his throat, but sighed and relaxed, letting his hands fall away to the sides. I squirmed lower on his body, making him inhale sharply, and set my mouth on his nipple.</p><p>I ran my tongue delicately round the tiny nub, making it stand up stiff, enjoying the coarse feel of the curly auburn hairs that surrounded it. I felt him tense under me, and put my hands on his upper arms to hold him still while I went on with it, biting gently, sucking and flicking with my tongue.</p><p>A few minutes later, I raised my head, brushed my hair back with one hand, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye.</p><p>\u201cThe rosary,\u201d he informed me. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to stand it.\u201d He closed his eyes and resumed murmuring in Latin. \u201cAve Maria, gratia plena...\u201d</p><p>I snorted and went to work on the other one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing your place,\u201d I said, next time I came up for air. \u201cYou\u2019ve said the Lord\u2019s Prayer three times in a row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to hear I\u2019m still makin\u2019 any sense at all.\u201d His eyes were closed, and a dew of moisture gleamed on his cheekbones. He moved his hips with increasing restiveness. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I dipped my head lower and seized by impulse, went Pffft! into his navel. He convulsed, and taken by surprise, emitted a noise that could only be described as a giggle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWill if I want to,\u201d I said, and did it again. \u201cYou sound just like Bree,\u201d I told him. \u201cI used to do that to her when she was a baby; she loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m no a wee bairn, if ye hadna noticed the difference,\u201d he said a little testily. \u201cIf ye must do that, at least try it a bit lower, aye?\u201d</p><p>I did.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any hair at all at the tops of your thighs,\u201d I said, admiring the smooth white skin there. \u201cWhy is that, do you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe cow licked it all off last time she milked me,\u201d he said between his teeth. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Sassenach!\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and returned to my work. At last I stopped and raised myself on my elbows.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough,\u201d I said, brushing hair out of my eyes. \u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything but \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019 over and over again for the last few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Given the cue, he surged upward, and flipped me onto my back, pinning me with the solid weight of his body.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to live to regret this, Sassenach,\u201d he said with a grim satisfaction.</p><p>I grinned at him, unrepentant.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, eyes narrowed. \u201cTake my time, was it? You\u2019ll beg for it, before I\u2019ve done wi\u2019 ye.\u201d</p><p>I tugged experimentally at my wrists, held tight in his grasp, and wriggled slightly under him with anticipation.</p> <p>\u201cOoh, mercy,\u201d I said. \u201cYou beast.\u201d</p><p>He snorted briefly, and bent his head to the curve of my breast, white as pearl in the dim green water-light.</p><p>I closed my eyes and lay back against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cPater noster, qui es in coelis...\u201d I whispered.</p><p>We were very late to supper.</p><p>Jamie lost no time over supper in asking about Mrs. Abernathy of Rose Hall.</p> <p>\u201cAbernathy?\u201d MacIver frowned, tapping his knife on the table to assist thought. \u201cAye, seems I\u2019ve heard the name, though I canna just charge my memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, ye ken Abernathy\u2019s fine,\u201d his wife interrupted, pausing in her instructions to a servant for the preparation of the hot pudding. \u201cIt\u2019s that place up the Yallahs River, in the mountains. Cane, mostly, but a wee bit of coffee, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, to be sure!\u201d her husband exclaimed. \u201cWhat a memory ye\u2019ve got, Rosie!\u201d He beamed fondly at his wife.</p><p>\u201cWell, I might not ha\u2019 brought it to mind mysel\u2019,\u201d she said modestly, \u201conly as how that minister over to New Grace kirk last week was askin\u2019 after Mrs. Abernathy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat minister is this, ma\u2019am?\u201d Jamie asked, taking a split roast chicken from the huge platter presented to him by a black servant.</p><p>\u201cSuch a fine braw appetite as ye have, Mr. Fraser!\u201d Mrs. MacIver exclaimed admiringly, seeing his loaded plate. \u201cIt\u2019s the island air does it, I expect.\u201d</p><p>The tips of Jamie\u2019s ears turned pink.</p><p>\u201cI expect it is,\u201d he said, carefully not looking at me. \u201cThis minister...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch, aye. Campbell, his name was, Archie Campbell.\u201d I started, and she glanced quizzically at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll know him?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, swallowing a pickled mushroom. \u201cI\u2019ve met him once, in Edinburgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, he\u2019s come to be a missionary, and bring the heathen blacks to the salvation of Our Lord Jesus.\u201d She spoke with admiration, and glared at her husband when he snorted. \u201cNow, ye\u2019ll no be makin\u2019 your Papist remarks, Kenny! The Reverend Campbell\u2019s a fine holy man, and a great scholar, forbye. I\u2019m Free Church myself,\u201d she said, leaning toward me confidingly. \u201cMy parents disowned me when I wed Kenny, but I told them I was sure he\u2019d come to see the light sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot later,\u201d her husband remarked, spooning jam onto his plate. He grinned at his wife, who sniffed and returned to her story.</p><p>\u201cSo, \u2019twas on account of the Reverend\u2019s bein\u2019 a great scholar that Mrs. Abernathy had written him, whilst he was still in Edinburgh, to ask him questions. And now that he\u2019s come here, he had it in mind to go and see her. Though after all Myra Dalrymple and the Reverend Davis telt him, I should be surprised he\u2019d set foot on her place,\u201d she added primly.</p><p>Kenny MacIver grunted, motioning to a servant in the doorway with another huge platter.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna put a great deal of stock in anything the Reverend Davis says, myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe man\u2019s too godly to shit. But Myra Dalrymple\u2019s a sensible woman. Ouch!\u201d He snatched back the fingers his wife had just cracked with a spoon, and sucked them.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Miss Dalrymple have to say of Mrs. Abernathy?\u201d Jamie inquired, hastily intervening before full-scale marital warfare could break out.</p><p>Mrs. MacIver\u2019s color was high, but she smoothed the frown from her brow as she turned to answer him.</p><p>\u201cWell, a great deal of it was no more than ill-natured gossip,\u201d she admitted. \u201cThe sorts of things folk will always say about a woman as lives alone. That she\u2019s owerfond of the company of her men-slaves, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was the talk when her husband died,\u201d Kenny interrupted. He slid several small, rainbow-striped fish off the platter the stooping servant held for him. \u201cI mind it well, now I come to think on the name.\u201d</p><p>Barnabas Abernathy had come from Scotland, and had purchased Rose Hall five years before. He had run the place decently, turning a small profit in sugar and coffee, causing no comment among his neighbors. Then, two years ago, he had married a woman no one knew, bringing her home from a trip to Guadeloupe.</p><p>\u201cAnd six months later, he was dead,\u201d Mrs. MacIver concluded with grim relish.</p><p>\u201cAnd the talk is that Mrs. Abernathy had something to do with it?\u201d Having some idea of the plethora of tropical parasites and diseases that attacked Europeans in the West Indies, I was inclined to doubt it, myself. Barnabas Abernathy could easily have died of anything from malaria to elephantiasis, but Rosie MacIver was right\u2014folk were partial to ill-natured gossip.</p><p>\u201cPoison,\u201d Rosie said, low-voiced, with a quick glance at the door to the kitchen. \u201cThe doctor who saw him said so. Mind, it could ha\u2019 been the slave-women. There was talk about Barnabas and his female slaves, and it\u2019s more common than folk like to say for a plantation cook-girl to be slipping something into the stew, but\u2014\u201d She broke off as another servant came in, carrying a cut-glass relish pot. Everyone was silent as the woman placed it on the table and left, curtsying to her mistress.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry,\u201d Mrs. MacIver said reassuringly, seeing me look after the woman. \u201cWe\u2019ve a boy who tastes everything, before it\u2019s served. It\u2019s all quite safe.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the mouthful of fish I had taken, with some difficulty.</p><p>\u201cDid the Reverend Campbell go to see Mrs. Abernathy, then?\u201d Jamie put in.</p><p>Rosie took the distraction gratefully. She shook her head, agitating the lace ruffles on her cap.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure not, for \u2019twas the very next day there was the stramash about his sister.\u201d</p><p>In the excitement of tracking Ian and the Bruja, I had nearly forgotten Margaret Jane Campbell.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to his sister?\u201d I asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cWhy, she\u2019s disappeared!\u201d Mrs. MacIver\u2019s blue eyes went wide with importance. Blue Mountain House was remote, some ten miles out of Kingston by land, and our presence provided an unparalleled opportunity for gossip.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fergus had been addressing himself to his plate with singleminded devotion, but now looked up, blinking. \u201cDisappeared? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole island\u2019s talking of it,\u201d Kenny put in, snatching the conversational ball from his wife. \u201cSeems the Reverend had a woman engaged as abigail to his sister, but the woman died of a fever on the voyage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad!\u201d I felt a real pang for Nellie Cowden, with her broad, pleasant face.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Kenny nodded offhandedly. \u201cWell, and so the Reverend found a place for his sister to lodge. Feebleminded, I understand?\u201d He lifted a brow at me.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, the lass seemed quiet and biddable, and Mrs. Forrest, who had the house where she lodged, would take her to sit on the veranda in the cool part of the day. So Tuesday last, a boy comes to say as Mrs. Forrest is wanted quicklike to come to her sister, who\u2019s having a child. And Mrs. Forrest got flustered and went straight off, forgetting Miss Campbell on the veranda. And when she thought of it, and sent someone back to see\u2014why Miss Campbell was gone. And not a smell of her since, in spite of the Reverend raising heaven and earth, ye might say.\u201d MacIver rocked back on his chair, puffing out his sun-mottled cheeks.</p><p>Mrs. MacIver wagged her head, tsking mournfully.</p><p>\u201cMyra Dalrymple told the Reverend as how he should go to the Governor for help to find her,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the Governor\u2019s scarce settled, and not yet ready to receive anyone. He\u2019s having a great reception this coming Thursday, for to meet all the important folk o\u2019 the island. Myra said as the Reverend must go, and speak to the Governor there, but he\u2019s no of a mind to do that, it bein\u2019 such a worldly occasion, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reception?\u201d Jamie set down his spoon, looking at Mrs. MacIver with interest. \u201cIs it by invitation, d\u2019ye know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cAnyone may come as likes to, or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Jamie glanced at me, smiling. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye think, Sassenach\u2014would ye care to step out wi\u2019 me at the Governor\u2019s Residence?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him in astonishment. I should have thought that the last thing he would wish to do was show himself in public. I was also surprised that he would let anything at all stop his visiting Rose Hall at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity to ask about Ian, no?\u201d he explained. \u201cAfter all, he might not be at Rose Hall, but someplace else on the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aside from the fact that I\u2019ve nothing to wear...\u201d I temporized, trying to figure out what he was really up to.</p><p>\u201cOch, that\u2019s no trouble,\u201d Rosie MacIver assured me. \u201cI\u2019ve one of the cleverest sempstresses on the island; she\u2019ll have ye tricked out in no time.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was nodding thoughtfully. He smiled, eyes slanting as he looked at me over the candle flame.</p><p>\u201cViolet silk, I think,\u201d he said. He plucked the bones delicately from his fish and set them aside. \u201cAnd as for the other\u2014dinna fash, Sassenach. I\u2019ve something in mind. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>58</p><p>MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH</p><p>\u201cOh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?</p><p>And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?</p><p>And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air?</p><p>Oh they\u2019re taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.\u201d</p><p>Jamie put down the wig in his hand and raised one eyebrow at me in the mirror. I grinned at him and went on, declaiming with gestures:</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a shame to human nature, such a head of hair as his;</p><p>In the good old time \u2019twas hanging for the colour that it is;</p><p>Though hanging isn\u2019t bad enough and flaying would be fair</p><p>For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid ye not tell me ye\u2019d studied for a doctor, Sassenach?\u201d he inquired. \u201cOr was it a poet, after all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d I assured him, coming to straighten his stock. \u201cThose sentiments are by one A. E. Housman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSurely one of him is sufficient,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cGiven the quality of his opinions.\u201d He picked up the wig and fitted it carefully on his head, raising little puffs of scented powder as he poked it here and there. \u201cIs Mr. Housman an acquaintance of yours, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say so.\u201d I sat down on the bed to watch. \u201cIt\u2019s only that the doctors\u2019 lounge at the hospital I worked at had a copy of Housman\u2019s collected works that someone had left there. There isn\u2019t time between calls to read most novels, but poems are ideal. I expect I know most of Housman by heart, now.\u201d</p><p>He looked warily at me, as though expecting another outburst of poetry, but I merely smiled at him, and he returned to his work. I watched the transformation in fascination.</p><p>Red-heeled shoes and silk stockings clocked in black. Gray satin breeches with silver knee buckles. Snowy linen, with Brussels lace six inches deep at cuff and jabot. The coat, a masterpiece in heavy gray with blue satin cuffs and crested silver buttons, hung behind the door, awaiting its turn.</p> <p>He finished the careful powdering of his face, and licking the end of one finger, picked up a false beauty mark, dabbed it in gum arabic, and affixed it neatly near the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, swinging about on the dressing stool to face me. \u201cDo I look like a red-heided Scottish smuggler?\u201d</p><p>I inspected him carefully, from full-bottomed wig to morocco-heeled shoes.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a gargoyle,\u201d I said. His face flowered in a wide grin. Outlined in white powder, his lips seemed abnormally red, his mouth even wider and more expressive than it usually was.</p><p>\u201cNon!\u201d said Fergus indignantly, coming in in time to hear this. \u201cHe looks like a Frenchman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuch the same thing,\u201d Jamie said, and sneezed. Wiping his nose on a handkerchief, he assured the young man, \u201cBegging your pardon, Fergus.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and reached for the coat, shrugging it over his shoulders and settling the edges. In three-inch heels, he towered to a height of six feet seven; his head nearly brushed the plastered ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, looking up at him dubiously. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Frenchman that size.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shrugged, his coat rustling like autumn leaves. \u201cAye, well, there\u2019s no hiding my height. But so long as my hair is hidden, I think it will be all right. Besides,\u201d he added, gazing with approval at me, \u201cfolk willna be looking at me. Stand up and let me see, aye?\u201d</p><p>I obliged, rotating slowly to show off the deep flare of the violet silk skirt. Cut low in the front, the d\u00e9colletage was filled with a froth of lace that rippled down the front of the bodice in a series of V\u2019s. Matching lace cascaded from the elbow-length sleeves in graceful white falls that left my wrists bare.</p><p>\u201cRather a pity I don\u2019t have your mother\u2019s pearls,\u201d I remarked. I didn\u2019t regret their lack; I had left them for Brianna, in the box with the photographs and family documents. Still, with the deep d\u00e9colletage and my hair twisted up in a knot, the mirror showed a long expanse of bare neck and bosom, rising whitely out of the violet silk.</p> <p>\u201cI thought of that.\u201d With the air of a conjuror, Jamie produced a small box from his inside pocket and presented it to me, making a leg in his best Versailles fashion.</p><p>Inside was a small, gleaming fish, carved in a dense black material, the edges of its scales touched with gold.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pin,\u201d he explained. \u201cYe could maybe wear it fastened to a white ribbon round your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful!\u201d I said, delighted. \u201cWhat\u2019s it made of? Ebony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack coral,\u201d he said. \u201cI got it yesterday, when Fergus and I were in Montego Bay.\u201d He and Fergus had taken the Artemis round the island, disposing at last of the cargo of bat guano, delivered to its purchaser.</p><p>I found a length of white satin ribbon, and Jamie obligingly tied it about my neck, bending to peer over my shoulder at the reflection in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cNo, they won\u2019t be looking at me,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf o\u2019 them will be lookin\u2019 at you, Sassenach, and the other half at Mr. Willoughby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Willoughby? Is that safe? I mean\u2014\u201d I stole a look at the little Chinese, sitting patiently cross-legged on a stool, gleaming in clean blue silk, and lowered my voice. \u201cI mean, they\u2019ll have wine, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie nodded. \u201cAnd whisky, and cambric, and claret cup, and port, and champagne punch\u2014and a wee cask of the finest French brandy\u2014contributed by the courtesy of Monsieur Etienne Marcel de Provac Alexandre.\u201d He put a hand on his chest and bowed again, in an exaggerated pantomime that made me laugh. \u201cNay worry,\u201d he said, straightening up. \u201cHe\u2019ll behave, or I\u2019ll have his coral globe back\u2014will I no, ye wee heathen?\u201d he added with a grin to Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>The Chinese scholar nodded with considerable dignity. The embroidered black silk of his round cap was decorated with a small carved knob of red coral\u2014the badge of his calling, restored to him by the chance encounter with a coral trader on the docks at Montego, and Jamie\u2019s good nature.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite sure we have to go?\u201d The palpitations I was experiencing were due in part to the tightness of the stays I was wearing, but in greater degree to recurring visions of Jamie\u2019s wig falling off and the reception coming to a complete stop as the entire assemblage paused to stare at his hair before calling en masse for the Royal Navy.</p><p>\u201cAye, we do.\u201d He smiled at me reassuringly. \u201cDinna worry, Sassenach; if anyone\u2019s there from the Porpoise, it\u2019s not likely they\u2019ll recognize me\u2014not like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. Do you think anyone from the ship will be there tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d He scratched viciously at the wig above his left ear. \u201cWhere did ye get this thing, Fergus? I believe it\u2019s got lice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, milord,\u201d Fergus assured him. \u201cThe wigmaker from whom I rented it assured me that it had been well dusted with hyssop and horse nettle to prevent any such infestations.\u201d Fergus himself was wearing his own hair, thickly powdered, and was handsome\u2014if less startling than Jamie\u2014in a new suit of dark blue velvet.</p><p>There was a tentative knock at the door, and Marsali stepped in. She too had had her wardrobe refurbished, and glowed in a dress of soft pink, with a deep rose sash.</p><p>She glowed somewhat more than I thought the dress accounted for, in fact, and as we made our way down the narrow corridor to the carriage, pulling in our skirts to keep them from brushing the walls, I managed to lean forward and murmur in her ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you using the tansy oil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d she said absently, her eyes on Fergus as he bowed and held open the carriage door for her. \u201cWhat did ye say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said, resigned. That was the least of our worries at the moment.</p><p>The Governor\u2019s mansion was ablaze with lights. Lanterns were perched along the low wall of the veranda, and hung from the trees along the paths of the ornamental garden. Gaily dressed people were emerging from their carriages on the crushed-shell drive, passing into the house through a pair of huge French doors.</p><p>We dismissed our own\u2014or, rather, Jared\u2019s\u2014carriage, but stood for a moment on the drive, waiting for a brief lull in the arrivals. Jamie seemed mildly nervous\u2014for him; his fingers twitched now and then against the gray satin, but his manner was outwardly as calm as ever.</p><p>There was a short reception line in the foyer; several of the minor dignitaries of the island had been invited to assist the new governor in welcoming his guests. I passed ahead of Jamie down the line, smiling and nodding to the Mayor of Kingston and his wife. I quailed a bit at the sight of a fully decorated admiral next in line, resplendent in gilded coat and epaulettes, but no sign of anything beyond a mild amazement crossed his features as he shook hands with the gigantic Frenchman and the tiny Chinese who accompanied me.</p><p>There was my acquaintance from the Porpoise; Lord John\u2019s blond hair was hidden under a formal wig tonight, but I recognized the fine, clear features and slight, muscular body at once. He stood a little apart from the other dignitaries, alone. Rumor had it that his wife had refused to leave England to accompany him to this posting.</p><p>He turned to greet me, his face fixed in an expression of formal politeness. He looked, blinked, and then broke into a smile of extraordinary warmth and pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Malcolm!\u201d he exclaimed, seizing my hands. \u201cI am vastly pleased to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe feeling is entirely mutual,\u201d I said, smiling back at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were the Governor, last time we met. I\u2019m afraid I was a bit informal.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his face glowing with the light of the candles in the wall sconces. Seen clearly in the light for the first time, I realized what a remarkably handsome man he was.</p><p>\u201cYou might be thought to have had an excellent excuse,\u201d he said. He looked me over carefully. \u201cMay I say that you are in remarkable fine looks this evening? Clearly the island air must agree with you somewhat more than the miasmas of shipboard. I had hoped to meet you again before leaving the Porpoise, but when I inquired for you, I was told by Mr. Leonard that you were unwell. I trust you are entirely recovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, entirely,\u201d I told him, amused. Unwell, eh? Evidently Tom Leonard was not about to admit to losing me overboard. I wondered whether he had put my disappearance in the log.</p><p>\u201cMay I introduce my husband?\u201d I turned to wave at Jamie, who had been detained in animated conversation with the admiral, but who was now advancing toward us, accompanied by Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>I turned back to find the Governor gone green as a gooseberry. He stared from Jamie to me, and back again, pale as though confronted by twin specters.</p><p>Jamie came to a stop beside me, and inclined his head graciously toward the Governor.</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see ye, man.\u201d</p><p>The Governor\u2019s mouth opened and shut without making a sound.</p><p>\u201cLet us make an opportunity to speak, a bit later,\u201d Jamie murmured. \u201cBut for now\u2014my name is Etienne Alexandre.\u201d He took my arm, and bowed formally. \u201cAnd may I have the pleasure to present to you my wife, Claire?\u201d he said aloud, shifting effortlessly into French.</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d The Governor looked wildly at me. \u201cClaire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, yes,\u201d I said, hoping he wasn\u2019t going to faint. He looked very much as though he might, though I had no idea why the revelation of my Christian name ought to affect him so strongly.</p><p>The next arrivals were waiting impatiently for us to move out of the way. I bowed, fluttering my fan, and we walked into the main salon of the Residence. I glanced back over my shoulder to see the Governor, shaking hands mechanically with the new arrival, staring after us with a face like white paper.</p><p>The salon was a huge room, low-ceilinged and filled with people, noisy and bright as a cageful of parrots. I felt some relief at the sight. Among this crowd, Jamie wouldn\u2019t be terribly conspicuous, despite his size.</p><p>A small orchestra played at one side of the room, near a pair of doors thrown open to the terrace outside. I saw a number of people strolling there, evidently seeking either a breath of air, or sufficient quiet to hold a private conversation. At the other side of the room, yet another pair of doors opened into a short hallway, where the retiring rooms were. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We knew no one, and had no social sponsor to make introductions. However, due to Jamie\u2019s foresight, we had no need of one. Within moments of our arrival, women had begun to cluster around us, fascinated by Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>\u201cMy acquaintance, Mr. Yi Tien Cho,\u201d Jamie introduced him to a stout young woman in tight yellow satin. \u201cLate of the Celestial Kingdom of China, Madame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d The young lady fluttered her fan before her face, impressed. \u201cReally from China? But what an unthinkable distance you must have come! Do let me welcome you to our small island, Mr.\u2014Mr. Cho?\u201d She extended a hand to him, clearly expecting it to be kissed.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby bowed deeply, hands in his sleeves, and obligingly said something in Chinese. The young woman looked thrilled. Jamie looked momentarily startled, and then the mask of urbanity dropped back over his face. I saw Mr. Willoughby\u2019s shining black eyes fix on the tips of the lady\u2019s shoes, protruding from under the hem of her dress, and wondered just what he had said to her.</p> <p>Jamie seized the opportunity\u2014and the lady\u2019s hand\u2014bowing over it with extreme politeness.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Madame,\u201d he said in thickly accented English. \u201cEtienne Alexandre. And might I present to you my wife, Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, so pleased to meet you!\u201d The young woman, flushed with excitement, took my hand and squeezed it. \u201cI\u2019m Marcelline Williams; perhaps you\u2019ll be acquainted with my brother, Judah? He owns Twelvetrees\u2014you know, the large coffee plantation? I\u2019ve come to stay with him for the season, and I\u2019m having ever so marvelous a time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t know anyone here,\u201d I said apologetically. \u201cWe\u2019ve only just arrived ourselves\u2014from Martinique, where my husband\u2019s sugar business is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Miss Williams cried, her eyes flying wide open. \u201cBut you must allow me to make you acquainted with my particular friends, the Stephenses! I believe they once visited Martinique, and Georgina Stephens is such a charming person\u2014you will like her at once, I promise!\u201d</p> <p>And that was all there was to it. Within an hour, I had been introduced to dozens of people, and was being carried slowly round the room, eddying from one group to the next, passed hand to hand by the current of introductions launched by Miss Williams.</p><p>Across the room, I could see Jamie, standing head and shoulders above his companions, the picture of aristocratic dignity. He was conversing cordially with a group of men, all eager to make the acquaintance of a prosperous businessman who might offer useful contacts with the French sugar trade. I caught his eye once, in passing, and he gave me a brilliant smile and a gallant French bow. I still wondered what in the name of God he thought he was up to, but shrugged mentally. He would tell me when he was ready.</p><p>Fergus and Marsali, as usual needing no one\u2019s company but each other\u2019s, were dancing at one end of the floor, her glowing pink face smiling into his. For the sake of the occasion, Fergus had forgone his useful hook, replacing it with a black leather glove filled with bran, pinned to the sleeve of his coat. This rested against the back of Marsali\u2019s gown, a trifle stiff-looking, but not so unnatural as to provoke comment.</p><p>I danced past them, revolving sedately in the arms of a short, tubby English planter named Carstairs, who wheezed pleasantries into my bosom, red face streaming sweat.</p><p>As for Mr. Willoughby, he was enjoying an unparalleled social triumph, the center of attention of a cluster of ladies who vied with each other in pressing dainties and refreshments on him. His eyes were bright, and a faint flush shone on his sallow cheeks.</p><p>Mr. Carstairs deposited me among a group of ladies at the end of the dance, and gallantly went to fetch a cup of claret. I at once returned to the business of the evening, asking the ladies whether they might be familiar with people to whose acquaintance I had been recommended, named Abernathy.</p> <p>\u201cAbernathy?\u201d Mrs. Hall, a youngish matron, fluttered her fan and looked blank. \u201cNo, I cannot say I am acquainted with them. Do they take a great part in society, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Joan!\u201d Her friend, Mrs. Yoakum, looked shocked, with the particular kind of enjoyable shock that precedes some juicy revelation. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of the Abernathys! You remember, the man who bought Rose Hall, up on the Yallahs River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Mrs. Hall\u2019s blue eyes widened. \u201cThe one who died so soon after buying it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one,\u201d another lady chimed in, overhearing. \u201cMalaria, they said it was, but I spoke to the doctor who attended him\u2014he had come to dress Mama\u2019s bad leg, you know she is such a martyr to the dropsy\u2014and he told me\u2014in strictest confidence, of course...\u201d</p><p>The tongues wagged merrily. Rosie MacIver had been a faithful reporter; all the stories she had conveyed were here, and more. I caught hold of the conversational thread and gave it a jerk in the desired direction.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mrs. Abernathy have indentured labor, as well as slaves?\u201d</p><p>Here opinion was more confused. Some thought that she had several indentured servants, some thought only one or two\u2014no one present had actually set foot in Rose Hall, but of course people said...</p><p>A few minutes later, the gossip had turned to fresh meat, and the incredible behavior of the new curate, Mr. Jones, with the widowed Mrs. Mina Alcott, but then, what could be expected of a woman with her reputation, and surely it was not entirely the young man\u2019s fault, and she so much older, though of course, one in Holy Orders might be expected to be held to a higher standard...I made an excuse and slipped away to the ladies\u2019 retiring room, my ears ringing.</p> <p>I saw Jamie as I went, standing near the refreshment table. He was talking to a tall, red-haired girl in embroidered cotton, a trace of unguarded tenderness lingering in his eyes as he looked at her. She was smiling eagerly up at him, flattered by his attention. I smiled at the sight, wondering what the young lady would think, did she realize that he was not really looking at her at all, but imagining her as the daughter he had never seen.</p><p>I stood in front of the looking glass in the outer retiring room, tucking in stray curls loosened by the exertion of dancing, and took pleasure in the temporary silence. The retiring room was luxuriously appointed, being in fact three separate chambers, with the privy facilities and a room for the storage of hats, shawls, and extraneous clothing opening off the main room, where I stood. This had not only a long pier-glass and a fully appointed dressing table, but also a chaise longue, covered in red velvet. I eyed it with some wistfulness\u2014the slippers I was wearing were pinching my feet badly\u2014but duty called.</p><p>So far, I had learned nothing beyond what we already knew about the Abernathy plantation, though I had compiled a useful list of several other plantations near Kingston that employed indentured labor. I wondered whether Jamie intended to call upon his friend the Governor to help in the search for Ian\u2014that might possibly justify risking an appearance here tonight.</p><p>But Lord John\u2019s response to the revelation of my identity was both puzzling and disturbing; you would think the man had seen a ghost. I squinted at my violet reflection, admiring the glitter of the black-and-gold fish at my throat, but failed to see anything unsettling in my appearance. My hair was tucked up with pins decorated with seed pearls and brilliants, and discreet use of Mrs. MacIver\u2019s cosmetics had darkened my lids and blushed my cheeks quite becomingly, if I did say so myself.</p><p>I shrugged, fluttered my lashes seductively at my image, then patted my hair and returned to the salon.</p><p>I made my way toward the long tables of refreshments, where a huge array of cakes, pastries, savories, fruits, candies, stuffed rolls, and a number of objects I couldn\u2019t put a name to but presumed edible were displayed. As I turned absentmindedly from the refreshment table with a plate of fruit, I collided headlong with a dark-hued waistcoat. Apologizing to its owner in confusion, I found myself looking up into the dour face of the Reverend Archibald Campbell.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Malcolm!\u201d he exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cEr...Reverend Campbell,\u201d I replied, rather weakly. \u201cWhat a surprise.\u201d I dabbed tentatively at a smear of mango on his abdomen, but he took a marked step backward, and I desisted.</p><p>He looked rather coldly at my d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>\u201cI trust I find you well, Mrs. Malcolm?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d I said. I wished he would stop calling me Mrs. Malcolm before someone to whom I had been introduced as Madame Alexandre heard him.</p><p>\u201cI was so sorry to hear about your sister,\u201d I said, hoping to distract him. \u201cHave you any word of her yet?\u201d</p><p>He bent his head stiffly, accepting my sympathy.</p><p>\u201cNo. My own attempts at instigating a search have of course been limited,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was at the suggestion of one of my parishioners that I accompanied him and his wife here tonight, with the intention of putting my case before the Governor, and begging his assistance in locating my sister. I assure you, Mrs. Malcolm, no less weighty a consideration would have impelled my attendance at a function such as this.\u201d</p><p>He cast a glance of profound dislike at a laughing group nearby, where three young men were competing with each other in the composition of witty toasts to a group of young ladies, who received these attentions with much giggling and energetic fan-fluttering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for your misfortune, Reverend,\u201d I said, edging aside. \u201cMiss Cowden told me a bit about your sister\u2019s tragedy. If I should be able to be of help...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can help,\u201d he interrupted. His eyes were bleak. \u201cIt was the fault of the Papist Stuarts, with their wicked attempt upon the throne, and the licentious Highlanders who followed them. No, no one can help, save God. He has destroyed the house of Stuart; he will destroy the man Fraser as well, and on that day, my sister will be healed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFraser?\u201d The trend of the conversation was making me distinctly uneasy. I glanced quickly across the room, but luckily Jamie was nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cThat is the name of the man who seduced Margaret from her family and her proper loyalties. His may not have been the hand that struck her down, but it was on his account that she had left her home and safety, and placed herself in danger. Aye, God will requite James Fraser fairly,\u201d he said with a sort of grim satisfaction at the thought.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure he will,\u201d I murmured. \u201cIf you will excuse me, I believe I see a friend...\u201d I tried to escape, but a passing procession of footmen bearing dishes of meat blocked my way.</p><p>\u201cGod will not suffer lewdness to endure forever,\u201d the Reverend went on, evidently feeling that the Almighty\u2019s opinions coincided largely with his own. His small gray eyes rested with icy disapproval on a group nearby, where several ladies fluttered around Mr. Willoughby like bright moths about a Chinese lantern.</p><p>Mr. Willoughby was brightly lit, too, in more than one sense of the word. His high-pitched giggle rose above the laughter of the ladies, and I saw him lurch heavily against a passing servant, nearly upsetting a tray of sorbet cups.</p><p>\u201cLet the women learn with all sobriety,\u201d the Reverend was intoning, \u201cavoiding all gaudiness of clothing and broided hair.\u201d He seemed to be hitting his stride; no doubt Sodom and Gomorrah would be up next. \u201cA woman who has no husband should devote herself to the service of the Lord, not be disporting herself with abandon in public places. Do you see Mrs. Alcott? And she a widow, who should be engaged in pious works!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I followed the direction of his frown and saw that he was looking at a chubby, jolly-looking woman in her thirties, with light brown hair done in gathered ringlets, who was giggling at Mr. Willoughby. I looked at her with interest. So this was the infamous merry widow of Kingston!</p><p>The little Chinese had now got down upon his hands and knees and was crawling around on the floor, pretending to look for a lost earring, while Mrs. Alcott squeaked in mock alarm at his forays toward her feet. I thought perhaps I had better find Fergus without delay, and have him detach Mr. Willoughby from his new acquaintance before matters went too far.</p><p>Evidently offended beyond bearing by the sight, the Reverend abruptly put down the cup of lemon squash he had been holding, turned and made his way through the crowd toward the terrace, vigorously elbowing people out of his way.</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief; conversation with the Reverend Campbell was a lot like exchanging frivolities with the public hangman\u2014though, in fact, the only hangman with whom I had been personally acquainted was much better company than the Reverend.</p> <p>Suddenly I saw Jamie\u2019s tall figure, heading for a door on the far side of the room, where I assumed the Governor\u2019s private quarters to be. He must be going to talk to Lord John now. Moved by curiosity, I decided to join him.</p><p>The floor was by now so crowded that it was difficult to make my way across it. By the time I reached the door through which Jamie had gone, he had long since disappeared, but I pushed my way through.</p><p>I was in a long hallway, dimly lighted by candles in sconces, and pierced at intervals by long casement windows, through which red light from the torches on the terrace outside flickered, picking up the gleam of metal from the decorations on the walls. These were largely military, consisting of ornamental sprays of pistols, knives, shields and swords. Lord John\u2019s personal souvenirs? I wondered, or had they come with the house?</p><p>Away from the clamor of the salon, it was remarkably quiet. I walked down the hallway, my steps muffled by the long Turkey carpet that covered the parquet.</p><p>There was an indistinguishable murmur of male voices ahead. I turned a corner into a shorter corridor and saw a door ahead from which light spilled\u2014that must be the Governor\u2019s private office. Inside, I heard Jamie\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God, John!\u201d he said.</p><p>I stopped dead, halted much more by the tone of that voice than by the words\u2014it was broken with an emotion I had seldom heard from him.</p><p>Walking very quietly, I drew closer. Framed in the half-open door was Jamie, head bowed as he pressed Lord John Grey tight in a fervent embrace.</p><p>I stood still, completely incapable of movement or speech. As I watched, they broke apart. Jamie\u2019s back was turned to me, but Lord John faced the hallway; he could have seen me easily, had he looked. He wasn\u2019t looking toward the hallway, though. He was staring at Jamie, and on his face was a look of such naked hunger that the blood rushed to my own cheeks when I saw it.</p><p>I dropped my fan. I saw the Governor\u2019s head turn, startled at the sound. Then I was running down the hall, back toward the salon, my heartbeat drumming in my ears.</p><p>I shot through the door into the salon and came to a halt behind a potted palm, heart pounding. The wrought-iron chandeliers were thick with beeswax candles, and pine torches burned brightly on the walls, but even so, the corners of the room were dark. I stood in the shadows, trembling.</p> <p>My hands were cold, and I felt slightly sick. What in the name of God was going on?</p><p>The Governor\u2019s shock at learning that I was Jamie\u2019s wife was now at least partially explained; that one glimpse of unguarded, painful yearning had told me exactly how matters stood on his side. Jamie was another question altogether.</p><p>He was the Governor of Ardsmuir prison, he had said, casually. And less casually, on another occasion, D\u2019ye ken what men in prison do?</p><p>I did know, but I would have sworn on Brianna\u2019s head that Jamie didn\u2019t; hadn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, under any circumstances whatever. At least I would have sworn that before tonight. I closed my eyes, chest heaving, and tried not to think of what I had seen.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t, of course. And yet, the more I thought of it, the more impossible it seemed. The memories of Jack Randall might have faded with the physical scars he had left, but I could not believe that they would ever fade sufficiently for Jamie to tolerate the physical attentions of another man, let alone to welcome them.</p><p>But if he knew Grey so intimately as to make what I had witnessed plausible in the name of friendship alone, then why had he not told me of him before? Why go to such lengths to see the man, as soon as he learned that Grey was in Jamaica? My stomach dropped once more, and the feeling of sickness returned. I wanted badly to sit down.</p><p>As I leaned against the wall, trembling in the shadows, the door to the Governor\u2019s quarters opened, and the Governor came out, returning to his party. His face was flushed and his eyes shone. I could at that moment easily have murdered him, had I anything more lethal than a hairpin to hand.</p><p>The door opened again a few minutes later, and Jamie emerged, no more than six feet away. His mask of cool reserve was in place, but I knew him well enough to see the marks of a strong emotion under it. But while I could see it, I couldn\u2019t interpret it. Excitement? Apprehension? Fear and joy mingled? Something else? I had simply never seen him look that way before.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t seek conversation or refreshments, but instead began to stroll about the room, obviously looking for someone. For me.</p><p>I swallowed heavily. I couldn\u2019t face him\u2014not in front of a crowd. I stayed where I was, watching him, until he finally went out onto the terrace. Then I left my hiding place, and crossed the room as quickly as I could, heading for the refuge of the retiring room. At least there I would be able to sit down for a moment.</p><p>I pushed open the heavy door and stepped inside, relaxing at once as the warm, comforting scents of women\u2019s perfume and powder surrounded me. Then the other smell struck me. It too was a familiar scent\u2014one of the smells of my profession. But not expected here.</p><p>The retiring room was still quiet; the loud rumble from the salon had dropped abruptly to a faint murmur, like a far-off thunderstorm. It was, however, no longer a place of refuge.</p><p>Mina Alcott lay sprawled across the red velvet chaise, her head hanging backward over the edge, her skirts in disarray about her neck. Her eyes were open, fixed in upside-down surprise. The blood from her severed throat had turned the velvet black beneath her, and dripped down into a large pool beneath her head. Her light brown hair had come loose from its dressing, the matted ends of her ringlets dangling in the puddle.</p><p>I stood frozen, too paralyzed even to call for help. Then I heard the sound of g*y voices in the hallway outside, and the door pushed open. There was a moment\u2019s silence as the women behind me saw it too.</p><p>Light from the corridor spilled through the door and across the floor, and in the moment before the screaming began, I saw the footprints leading toward the window\u2014the small neat prints of a felt-soled foot, outlined in blood.</p><p>59</p><p>IN WHICH MUCH IS REVEALED</p><p>They had taken Jamie somewhere. I, shaking and incoherent, had been put\u2014with a certain amount of irony\u2014in the Governor\u2019s private office with Marsali, who insisted on trying to bathe my face with a damp towel, in spite of my resistance.</p><p>\u201cThey canna think Da had anything to do with it!\u201d she said, for the fifth time.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d I finally pulled myself together enough to talk to her. \u201cBut they think Mr. Willoughby did\u2014and Jamie brought him here.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me, wide-eyed with horror.</p><p>\u201cMr. Willoughby? But he couldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought so.\u201d I felt as though someone had been beating me with a club; everything ached. I sat slumped on a small velvet love seat, aimlessly twirling a glass of brandy between my hands, unable to drink it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even decide what I ought to feel, let alone sort out the conflicting events and emotions of the evening. My mind kept jumping between the grisly scene in the retiring room, and the tableau I had seen a half-hour earlier, in this very room.</p><p>I sat looking at the Governor\u2019s big desk. I could still see the two of them, Jamie and Lord John, as though they had been painted on the wall before me.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t believe it,\u201d I said out loud, and felt slightly better for the saying.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d said Marsali. She was pacing the floor, her footsteps changing from the click of heels on parquet to a muffled thump as she hit the flowered carpet. \u201cHe can\u2019t have! I ken he\u2019s a heathen, but we\u2019ve lived wi\u2019 the man! We know him!\u201d</p><p>Did we? Did I know Jamie? I would have sworn I did, and yet...I kept remembering what he had said to me at the brothel, during our first night together. Will ye take me, and risk the man that I am, for the sake of the man ye knew? I had thought then\u2014and since\u2014that there was not so much difference between them. But if I were wrong?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wrong!\u201d I muttered, clutching my glass fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d If Jamie could take Lord John Grey as a lover, and hide it from me, he wasn\u2019t remotely the man I thought he was. There had to be some other explanation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell you about Laoghaire, said an insidious little voice inside my head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d I said to it stoutly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d Marsali was looking at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; don\u2019t mind me.\u201d I brushed a hand across my face, trying to wipe away confusion and weariness. \u201cIt\u2019s taking them a long time.\u201d</p><p>The walnut case-clock had struck two o\u2019clock in the morning before the door of the office opened and Fergus came in, accompanied by a grim-looking militiaman.</p><p>Fergus was somewhat the worse for wear; most of the powder had gone from his hair, shaken onto the shoulders of his dark blue coat like dandruff. What was left gave his hair a grayish cast, as though he had aged twenty years overnight. No surprise; I felt as though I had.</p><p>\u201cWe can go now, ch\u00e8rie,\u201d he said quietly to Marsali. He turned to me. \u201cWill you come with us, milady, or wait for milord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t going to bed until I had seen Jamie, no matter how long it took.</p><p>\u201cI will have the carriage return for you, then,\u201d he said, and put a hand on Marsali\u2019s back to usher her out.</p><p>The militiaman said something under his breath as they passed him. I didn\u2019t catch it, but evidently Fergus did. He stiffened, eyes narrowing, and turned back toward the man. The militiaman rocked up onto the balls of his feet, smiling evilly and looking expectant. Clearly he would like nothing better than an excuse to hit Fergus.</p><p>To his surprise, Fergus smiled charmingly at him, square white teeth gleaming.</p><p>\u201cMy thanks, mon ami,\u201d he said, \u201cfor your assistance in this most trying situation.\u201d He thrust out a black-gloved hand, which the militiaman accepted in surprise.</p><p>Then Fergus jerked his arm suddenly backward. There was a brief rip, and a pattering sound, as a small stream of bran struck the parquet floor.</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d he told the militiaman graciously. \u201cA small token of my appreciation.\u201d And then they were gone, leaving the man slack-jawed, staring down in horror at the apparently severed hand in his grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was another hour before the door opened again, this time to admit the Governor. He was still handsome and neat as a white camellia, but definitely beginning to turn brown round the edges. I set the untouched glass of brandy down and got to my feet to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill being questioned by Captain Jacobs, the militia commander.\u201d He sank into his chair, looking bemused. \u201cI had no notion he spoke French so remarkably well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know him all that well,\u201d I said, deliberately baiting. What I wanted badly to know was just how well he did know Jamie. He didn\u2019t rise to it, though; merely took off his formal wig and laid it aside, running a hand through his damp blond hair with relief.</p> <p>\u201cCan he keep up such an impersonation, do you think?\u201d he asked, frowning, and I realized that he was so occupied with thoughts of the murder and of Jamie that he was paying little, if any, attention to me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cWhere do they have him?\u201d I got up, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cIn the formal parlor,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not pausing to listen, I yanked open the door and poked my head into the hall, then hastily drew it back and slammed the door.</p><p>Coming down the hall was the Admiral I had met in the receiving line, face set in lines of gravity suitable to the situation. Admirals I could deal with. However, he was accompanied by a flotilla of junior officers, and among the entourage I had spotted a face I knew, though he was now wearing the uniform of a first lieutenant, instead of an oversized captain\u2019s coat.</p> <p>He was shaved and rested, but his face was puffy and discolored; someone had beaten him up in the not too distant past. Despite the differences in his appearance, I had not the slightest difficulty in recognizing Thomas Leonard. I had the distinct feeling that he wouldn\u2019t have any trouble recognizing me, either, violet silk notwithstanding.</p><p>I looked frantically about the office for someplace to hide, but short of crawling into the kneehole of the desk, there was no place at all. The Governor was watching me, fair brows raised in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d he began, but I rounded on him, finger to my lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me away, if you value Jamie\u2019s life!\u201d I hissed melodramatically, and so saying, flung myself onto the velvet love seat, snatched up the damp towel and dropped it on my face, and\u2014with a superhuman effort of will\u2014forced all my limbs to go limp.</p><p>I heard the door open, and the Admiral\u2019s high, querulous voice.</p><p>\u201cLord John\u2014\u201d he began, and then evidently noticed my supine form, for he broke off and resumed in a slightly lower voice, \u201cOh! I collect you are engaged?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot precisely engaged, Admiral, no.\u201d Grey had fast reflexes, I would say that for him; he sounded perfectly self-possessed, as though he were quite used to being found in custody of unconscious females. \u201cThe lady was overcome by the shock of discovering the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d said the Admiral again, this time dripping with sympathy. \u201cI quite see that. Beastly shock for a lady, to be sure.\u201d He hesitated, then dropping his voice to a sort of hoarse whisper, said, \u201cD\u2019you think she\u2019s asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think so,\u201d the Governor assured him. \u201cShe\u2019s had enough brandy to fell a horse.\u201d My fingers twitched, but I managed to lie still.</p><p>\u201cOh, quite. Best thing for shock, brandy.\u201d The Admiral went on whispering, sounding like a rusted hinge. \u201cMeant to tell you I have sent to Antigua for additional troops\u2014quite at your disposal\u2014guards, search the town\u2014if the militia don\u2019t find the fellow first,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI hope they may not,\u201d said a viciously determined voice among the officers. \u201cI\u2019d like to catch the yellow bugger myself. There wouldn\u2019t be enough of him left to hang, believe me!\u201d</p><p>A deep murmur of approval at this sentiment went through the men, to be sternly quelled by the Admiral.</p><p>\u201cYour sentiments do you credit, gentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the law will be observed in all respects. You will make that clear to the troops in your command; when the miscreant is taken, he is to be brought to the Governor, and justice will be properly executed, I assure you.\u201d I didn\u2019t like the way he emphasized the word \u201cexecuted,\u201d but he got a grudging chorus of assent from his officers.</p><p>The Admiral, having delivered this order in his ordinary voice, dropped back into a whisper to take his leave.</p> <p>\u201cI shall be staying in the town, at MacAdams\u2019 Hotel,\u201d he croaked. \u201cDo not hesitate to send to me for any assistance, Your Excellency.\u201d</p><p>There was a general shuffle and murmur as the naval officers took their leave, observing discretion for the sake of my slumbers. Then came the sound of a single pair of footsteps, and then the whoosh and creak of someone settling heavily into a chair. There was silence for a moment.</p><p>Then Lord John said \u201cYou can get up now, if you wish. I am supposing that you are not in fact prostrate with shock,\u201d he added, ironically. \u201cSomehow I suspect that a mere murder would not be sufficient to discompose a woman who could deal single-handedly with a typhoid epidemic.\u201d</p><p>I removed the towel from my face and swung my feet off the chaise, sitting up to face him. He was leaning on his desk, chin in his hands, staring at me.</p><p>\u201cThere are shocks,\u201d I said precisely, smoothing back my damp curls and giving him an eyeball, \u201cand then there are shocks. If you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised; then a flicker of understanding came into his expression. He reached into the drawer of his desk, and pulled out my fan, white silk embroidered with violets.</p><p>\u201cThis is yours, I suppose? I found it in the corridor.\u201d His mouth twisted wryly as he looked at me. \u201cI see. I suppose, then, you will have some notion of how your appearance earlier this evening affected me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it very much,\u201d I said. My fingers were still icy, and I felt as though I had swallowed some large, cold object that pressed uncomfortably under my breastbone. I breathed deeply, trying to force it down, to no avail. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that Jamie was married?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, but not in time to keep me from seeing a small grimace of pain, as though someone had struck him suddenly across the face.</p><p>\u201cI knew he had been married,\u201d he corrected. He dropped his hands, fiddling aimlessly with the small objects that littered his desk. \u201cHe told me\u2014or gave me to understand, at least\u2014that you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Grey picked up a small silver paperweight, and turned it over and over in his hands, eyes fixed on the gleaming surface. A large sapphire was set in it, winking blue in the candlelight.</p><p>\u201cHas he never mentioned me?\u201d he asked softly. I wasn\u2019t sure whether the undertone in his voice was pain or anger. Despite myself, I felt some small sense of pity for him.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d I said. \u201cHe said you were his friend.\u201d He glanced up, the fine-cut face lightening a bit.</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2014I\u2014we were separated by the war, the Rising. Each of us thought the other was dead. I found him again only\u2014my God, was it only four months ago?\u201d I felt staggered, and not only by the events of the evening. I felt as though I had lived several lifetimes since the day I had opened the door of the printshop in Edinburgh, to find A. Malcolm bending over his press.</p><p>The lines of stress in Grey\u2019s face eased a little.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSo\u2014you have not seen him since\u2014my God, that\u2019s twenty years!\u201d He stared at me, dumbfounded. \u201cAnd four months? Why\u2014how\u2014\u201d He shook his head, brushing away the questions.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s of no consequence just now. But he did not tell you\u2014that is\u2014has he not told you about Willie?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Willie?\u201d</p><p>Instead of explaining, he bent and opened the drawer of his desk. He pulled out a small object and laid it on the desk, motioning me to come closer.</p><p>It was a portrait, an oval miniature, set in a carved frame of some fine-grained dark wood. I looked at the face, and sat down abruptly, my knees gone to water. I was only dimly aware of Grey\u2019s face, floating above the desk like a cloud on the horizon, as I picked up the miniature to look at it more closely.</p><p>He might have been Bree\u2019s brother, was my first thought. The second, coming with the force of a blow to the solar plexus, was \u201cMy God in heaven, he is Bree\u2019s brother!\u201d</p><p>There couldn\u2019t be much doubt about it. The boy in the portrait was perhaps nine or ten, with a childish tenderness still lingering about his face, and his hair was a soft chestnut brown, not red. But the slanted blue eyes looked out boldly over a straight nose a fraction of an inch too long, and the high Viking cheekbones pressed tight against smooth skin. The tilt of the head held the same confident carriage as that of the man who had given him that face.</p><p>My hands trembled so violently that I nearly dropped it. I set it back on the desk, but kept my hand over it, as though it might leap up and bite me. Grey was watching me, not without sympathy.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014\u201d My voice was hoarse with shock, and I had to stop and clear my throat. \u201cWho is his mother?\u201d</p><p>Grey hesitated, eyeing me closely, then shrugged slightly.</p><p>\u201cWas. She\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d The ripples of shock were still spreading from an epicenter in my stomach, making the crown of my head tingle and my toes go numb, but at least my vocal cords were coming back under my control. I could hear Jenny saying, He\u2019s no the sort of man should sleep alone, aye? Evidently he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Geneva Dunsany,\u201d Grey said. \u201cMy wife\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>My mind was reeling, in an effort to make sense of all this, and I suppose I was less than tactful.</p><p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d I said, goggling at him. He flushed deeply and looked away. If I had been in any doubt about the nature of the look I had seen him give Jamie, I wasn\u2019t any longer.</p><p>\u201cI think you had better bloody well explain to me just what you have to do with Jamie, and this Geneva, and this boy,\u201d I said, picking up the portrait once more.</p><p>He raised one brow, cool and reserved; he had been shocked, too, but the shock was wearing off.</p><p>\u201cI cannot see that I am under any particular obligation to do so,\u201d he said.</p><p>I fought back the urge to rake my nails down his face, but the impulse must have shown on my face, for he pushed back his chair and got his feet under him, ready to move quickly. He eyed me warily across the expanse of dark wood.</p><p>I took several deep breaths, unclenched my fists, and spoke as calmly as I could.</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re not. But I would appreciate it very much if you did. And why did you show me the picture if you didn\u2019t mean me to know?\u201d I added. \u201cSince I know that much, I\u2019ll certainly find out the rest from Jamie. You might as well tell me your side of it now.\u201d I glanced at the window; the slice of sky that showed between the half-open shutters was still a velvet black, with no sign of dawn. \u201cThere\u2019s time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He breathed deeply, and laid down the paperweight. \u201cI suppose there is.\u201d He jerked his head abruptly at the decanter. \u201cWill you have brandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I said promptly, \u201cand I strongly suggest you have some, too. I expect you need it as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>A slight smile showed briefly at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs that a medical opinion, Mrs. Malcolm?\u201d he asked dryly.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I said.</p><p>This small truce established, he sat back, rolling his beaker of brandy slowly between his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou said Jamie mentioned me to you,\u201d he said. I must have flinched slightly at his use of Jamie\u2019s name, for he frowned at me. \u201cWould you prefer that I referred to him by his surname?\u201d he said, coldly. \u201cI should scarcely know which to use, under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I waved it away, and took a sip of brandy. \u201cYes, he mentioned you. He said you had been the Governor of the prison at Ardsmuir, and that you were a friend\u2014and that he could trust you,\u201d I added reluctantly. Possibly Jamie felt he could trust Lord John Grey, but I was not so sanguine.</p><p>The smile this time was not quite so brief.</p> <p>\u201cI am glad to hear that,\u201d Grey said softly. He looked down into the amber liquid in his cup, swirling it gently to release its heady bouquet. He took a sip, then set the cup down with decision.</p><p>\u201cI met him at Ardsmuir, as he said,\u201d he began. \u201cAnd when the prison was shut down and the other prisoners sold to indenture in America, I arranged that Jamie should be paroled instead to a place in England, called Helwater, owned by friends of my family.\u201d He looked at me, hesitating, then added simply, \u201cI could not bear the thought of never seeing him again, you see.\u201d</p><p>In a few brief words, he acquainted me with the bare facts of Geneva\u2019s death and Willie\u2019s birth.</p><p>\u201cWas he in love with her?\u201d I asked. The brandy was doing its bit to warm my hands and feet, but it didn\u2019t touch the large cold object in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cHe has never spoken to me of Geneva,\u201d Grey said. He gulped the last of his brandy, coughed, and reached to pour another cup. It was only when he finished this operation that he looked at me again, and added, \u201cBut I doubt it, having known her.\u201d His mouth twisted wryly.</p><p>\u201cHe never told me about Willie, either, but there was a certain amount of gossip about Geneva and old Lord Ellesmere, and by the time the boy was four or five, the resemblance made it quite clear who his father was\u2014to anyone who cared to look.\u201d He took another deep swallow of brandy. \u201cI suspect that my mother-in-law knows, but of course she would never breathe a word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me over the rim of his cup.</p><p>\u201cNo, would you? If it were a choice of your only grandchild being either the ninth Earl of Ellesmere, and heir to one of the wealthiest estates in England, or the penniless bastard of a Scottish criminal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d I drank some more of my own brandy, trying to imagine Jamie with a young English girl named Geneva\u2014and succeeding all too well.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Grey said dryly. \u201cJamie saw, too. And very wisely arranged to leave Helwater before it became obvious to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you come back into the story, is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He nodded, eyes closed. The Residence was quiet, though there was a certain distant stir that made me aware that people were still about.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cJamie gave the boy to me.\u201d</p> <p>The stable at Ellesmere was well-built; cozy in the winter, it was a cool haven in summer. The big bay stallion flicked its ears lazily at a passing fly, but stood stolidly content, enjoying the attentions of his groom.</p><p>\u201cIsobel is most displeased with you,\u201d Grey said.</p><p>\u201cIs she?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was indifferent. There was no need any longer to worry about displeasing any of the Dunsanys.</p><p>\u201cShe said you had told Willie you were leaving, which upset him dreadfully. He\u2019s been howling all day.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face was turned away, but Grey saw the faint tightening at the side of his throat. He rocked backward, leaning against the stable wall as he watched the curry comb come down and down and down in hard, even strokes that left dark trails across the shimmering coat.</p><p>\u201cSurely it would have been easier to say nothing to the boy?\u201d Grey said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it would\u2014for Lady Isobel.\u201d Fraser turned to put up the curry comb, and slapped a hand on the stallion\u2019s rump in dismissal. Grey thought there was an air of finality in the gesture; tomorrow Jamie would be gone. He felt a slight thickening in his own throat, but swallowed it. He rose and followed Fraser toward the door of the stall.</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014\u201d he said, putting his hand on Fraser\u2019s shoulder. The Scot swung round, his features hastily readjusting themselves, but not fast enough to hide the misery in his eyes. He stood still, looking down at the Englishman.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right to go,\u201d Grey said. Alarm flared in Fraser\u2019s eyes, quickly supplanted by wariness.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnyone with half an eye could see it,\u201d Grey said dryly. \u201cIf anyone ever actually looked at a groom, someone would have noticed long before now.\u201d He glanced back at the bay stallion, and cocked one brow. \u201cSome sires stamp their get. I have the distinct impression that any offspring of yours would be unmistakable.\u201d</p><p>Jamie said nothing, but Grey fancied that he had grown a shade paler than usual.</p><p>\u201cSurely you can see\u2014well, no, perhaps not,\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a looking glass, have you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head mechanically. \u201cNo,\u201d he said absently. \u201cI shave in the reflection from the trough.\u201d He drew in a deep breath, and let it out slowly.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. He glanced toward the house, where the French doors were standing open onto the lawn. Willie was accustomed to play there after lunch on fine days.</p><p>Fraser turned to him with sudden decision. \u201cWill ye walk with me?\u201d he said.</p><p>Not pausing for an answer, he set off past the stable, turning down the lane that led from the paddock to the lower pasture. It was nearly a quarter-mile before he came to a halt, in a sunny clearing by a clump of willows, near the edge of the mere.</p><p>Grey found himself puffing slightly from the quick pace\u2014too much soft living in London, he chided himself. Fraser, of course, was not even sweating, despite the warmth of the day.</p><p>Without preamble, turning to face Grey, he said, \u201cI wish to ask a favor of ye.\u201d The slanted blue eyes were direct as the man himself.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I would tell anyone...\u201d Grey began, then shook his head. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t think I could do such a thing. After all, I have known\u2014or at least suspected\u2014for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A faint smile lifted Jamie\u2019s mouth. \u201cNo, I dinna think ye would. But I would ask ye...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Grey said promptly. The corner of Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna wish to know what it is first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should imagine that I know; you wish me to look out for Willie; perhaps to send you word of his welfare.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s it.\u201d He glanced up the slope, to where the house lay half-hidden in its nest of fiery maples. \u201cIt\u2019s an imposition, maybe, to ask ye to come all the way from London to see him now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Grey interrupted. \u201cI came this afternoon to give you some news of my own; I am to be married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d The shock was plain on Fraser\u2019s face. \u201cTo a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there are not many alternatives,\u201d Grey replied dryly. \u201cBut yes, since you ask, to a woman. To the Lady Isobel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, man! Ye canna do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d Grey assured him. He grimaced. \u201cI made trial of my capacity in London; be assured that I shall make her an adequate husband. You needn\u2019t necessarily enjoy the act in order to perform it\u2014or perhaps you were aware of that?\u201d</p><p>There was a small reflexive twitch at the corner of Jamie\u2019s eye; not quite a flinch, but enough for Grey to notice. Jamie opened his mouth, then closed it again and shook his head, obviously thinking better of what he had been about to say.</p><p>\u201cDunsany is growing too old to take a hand in the running of the estate,\u201d Grey pointed out. \u201cGordon is dead, and Isobel and her mother cannot manage the place alone. Our families have known each other for decades. It is an entirely suitable match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it, then?\u201d The sardonic skepticism in Jamie\u2019s voice was clear. Grey turned to him, fair skin flushing as he answered sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt is. There is more to a marriage than carnal love. A great deal more.\u201d</p><p>Fraser swung sharply away. He strode to the edge of the mere, and stood, boots sunk in the reedy mud, looking over the ruffled waves for some time. Grey waited patiently, taking the time to unribbon his hair and reorder the thick blond mass.</p><p>At long last, Fraser came back, walking slowly, head down as though still thinking. Face-to-face with Grey he looked up again.</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI have no right to think ill of you, if ye mean no dishonor to the lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d Grey said. \u201cBesides,\u201d he added more cheerfully, \u201cit means I will be here permanently, to see to Willie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to resign your commission, then?\u201d One copper eyebrow flicked upward.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Grey said. He smiled, a little ruefully. \u201cIt will be a relief, in a way. I was not meant for army life, I think.\u201d</p><p>Fraser seemed to be thinking. \u201cI should be...grateful, then,\u201d he said, \u201cif you would stand as stepfather to\u2014to my son.\u201d He had likely never spoken the word aloud before, and the sound of it seemed to shock him. \u201cI...would be obliged to you.\u201d Jamie sounded as though his collar were too tight, though in fact his shirt was open at the throat. Grey looked curiously at him, and saw that his countenance was slowly turning a dark and painful red.</p><p>\u201cIn return...If you want...I mean, I would be willing to...that is...\u201d</p><p>Grey suppressed the sudden desire to laugh. He laid a light hand on the big Scot\u2019s arm, and saw Jamie brace himself not to flinch at the touch.</p><p>\u201cMy dear Jamie,\u201d he said, torn between laughter and exasperation. \u201cAre you actually offering me your body in payment for my promise to look after Willie?\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s face was red to the roots of his hair.</p><p>\u201cAye, I am,\u201d he snapped, tight-lipped. \u201cD\u2019ye want it, or no?\u201d</p><p>At this, Grey did laugh, in long gasping whoops, finally having to sit down on the grassy bank in order to recover himself.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear God,\u201d he said at last, wiping his eyes. \u201cThat I should live to hear an offer like that!\u201d</p><p>Fraser stood above him, looking down, the morning light silhouetting him, lighting his hair in flames against the pale blue sky. Grey thought he could see a slight twitch of the wide mouth in the darkened face\u2014humor, tempered with a profound relief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYe dinna want me, then?\u201d</p><p>Grey got to his feet, dusting the seat of his breeches. \u201cI shall probably want you to the day I die,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cBut tempted as I am\u2014\u201d He shook his head, brushing wet grass from his hands.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that I would demand\u2014or accept\u2014any payment for such a service?\u201d he asked. \u201cReally, I should feel my honor most grossly insulted by that offer, save that I know the depth of feeling which prompted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d Jamie muttered. \u201cI didna mean to insult ye.\u201d</p> <p>Grey was not sure at this point whether to laugh or cry. Instead, he reached a hand up and gently touched Jamie\u2019s cheek, fading now to its normal pale bronze. More quietly, he said, \u201cBesides, you cannot give me what you do not have.\u201d</p><p>Grey felt, rather than saw, the slight relaxation of tension in the tall body facing him.</p><p>\u201cYou shall have my friendship,\u201d Jamie said softly, \u201cif that has any value to ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very great value indeed.\u201d The two men stood silent together for a moment, then Grey sighed and turned to look up at the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. I suppose you will have a great many things to do today?\u201d</p><p>Jamie cleared his throat. \u201cAye, I have. I suppose I should be about my business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>Grey tugged down the points of his waistcoat, ready to go. But Jamie lingered awkwardly a moment, and then, as though suddenly making up his mind to it, stepped forward and bending down, cupped Grey\u2019s face between his hands.</p><p>Grey felt the big hands warm on the skin of his face, light and strong as the brush of an eagle\u2019s feather, and then Jamie Fraser\u2019s soft wide mouth touched his own. There was a fleeting impression of tenderness and strength held in check, the faint taste of ale and fresh-baked bread. Then it was gone, and John Grey stood blinking in the brilliant sun.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jamie gave him a shy, crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m maybe not poisoned.\u201d He turned then, and disappeared into the screen of willows, leaving Lord John Grey alone by the mere.</p> <p>The Governor was quiet for a moment. Then he looked up with a bleak smile.</p><p>\u201cThat was the first time that he ever touched me willingly,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd the last\u2014until this evening, when I gave him the other copy of that miniature.\u201d</p><p>I sat completely motionless, the brandy glass unregarded in my hands. I wasn\u2019t sure what I felt; shock, fury, horror, jealousy, and pity all washed through me in successive waves, mingling in eddies of confused emotion.</p><p>A woman had been violently done to death nearby, within the last few hours. And yet the scene in the retiring room seemed unreal by comparison with that miniature; a small and unimportant picture, painted in tones of red. For the moment, neither Lord John nor I was concerned with crime or justice\u2014or with anything beyond what lay between us.</p><p>The Governor was examining my face, with considerable absorption.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should have recognized you on the ship,\u201d he said. \u201cBut of course, at the time, I had thought you long dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was dark,\u201d I said, rather stupidly. I shoved a hand through my curls, feeling dizzy from brandy and sleeplessness. Then I realized what he had said.</p><p>\u201cRecognized me? But you\u2019d never met me!\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall a dark wood, near Carryarrick in the Scottish Highlands, twenty years ago? And a young boy with a broken arm? You set it for me.\u201d He lifted one arm in demonstration.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ.\u201d I picked up the brandy and took a swallow that made me cough and gasp. I blinked at him, eyes watering. Knowing now who he was, I could make out the fine, light bones and see the slighter, softer outline of the boy he had been.</p><p>\u201cYours were the first woman\u2019s br**sts I had ever seen,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cIt was a considerable shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom which you appear to have recovered,\u201d I said, rather coldly. \u201cYou seem to have forgiven Jamie for breaking your arm and threatening to shoot you, at least.\u201d</p><p>He flushed slightly, and set down his beaker.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014well\u2014yes,\u201d he said, abruptly.</p><p>We sat there for quite some time, neither of us having any idea what to say. He took a breath once or twice, as though about to say something, but then abandoned it. At last, he closed his eyes as though commending his soul to God, opened them and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you know\u2014\u201d he began, then stopped. He looked down at his clenched hands, then, not at me. A blue stone winked on one knuckle, bright as a teardrop.</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he said again, softly, addressing his hands, \u201cwhat it is to love someone, and never\u2014never!\u2014be able to give them peace, or joy, or happiness?\u201d</p><p>He looked up then, eyes filled with pain. \u201cTo know that you cannot give them happiness, not through any fault of yours or theirs, but only because you were not born the right person for them?\u201d</p><p>I sat quiet, seeing not his, but another handsome face; dark, not fair. Not feeling the warm breath of the tropical night, but the icy hand of a Boston winter. Seeing the pulse of light like heart\u2019s blood, spilling across the cold snow of hospital linens.</p><p>...only because you were not born the right person for them.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered, hands clenched in my lap. I had told Frank\u2014Leave me. But he could not, no more than I could love him rightly, having found my match elsewhere.</p><p>Oh, Frank, I said, silently. Forgive me.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am asking whether you believe in fate,\u201d Lord John went on. The ghost of a smile wavered on his face. \u201cYou, of all people, would seem best suited to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think so, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I said bleakly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, any more than you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, then reached out and picked up the miniature.</p><p>\u201cI have been more fortunate than most, I suppose,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThere was the one thing he would take from me.\u201d His expression softened as he looked down into the face of the boy in the palm of his hand. \u201cAnd he has given me something most precious in return.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, my hand spread out across my belly. Jamie had given me that same precious gift\u2014and at the same great cost to himself.</p><p>The sound of footsteps came down the hall, muffled by the carpet. There was a sharp rap at the door, and a militiaman stuck his head into the office.</p><p>\u201cIs the lady recovered yet?\u201d he asked. \u201cCaptain Jacobs has finished his questions, and Monsieur Alexandre\u2019s carriage has returned.\u201d</p><p>I got hastily to my feet.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I turned to the Governor, not knowing what to say to him. \u201cI\u2014thank you for\u2014that is\u2014\u201d</p><p>He bowed formally to me, coming around the desk to see me out.</p><p>\u201cI regret extremely that you should have been subjected to such a shocking experience, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, with no trace of anything but diplomatic regret in his voice. He had resumed his official manner, smooth and polished as his parquet floors.</p><p>I followed the militiaman, but at the door I turned impulsively.</p><p>\u201cWhen we met, that night aboard the Porpoise\u2014I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t know who I was. I...liked you. Then.\u201d</p><p>He stood for a second, polite, remote. Then the mask dropped away.</p><p>\u201cI liked you, too,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cThen.\u201d</p><p>I felt as though I were riding next to a stranger. The light was beginning to gray toward dawn, and even in the dimness of the coach, I could see Jamie sitting opposite me, his face drawn with weariness. He had taken off the ridiculous wig as soon as we drove away from Government House, discarding the facade of the polished Frenchman to let the disheveled Scot beneath show through. His unbound hair lay in waves over his shoulders, dark in that predawn light that robs everything of color.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he did it?\u201d I asked at last, only for something to say.</p><p>His eyes were closed. At this, they opened and he shrugged slightly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. He sounded exhausted. \u201cI have asked myself that a thousand times tonight\u2014and been asked it even more.\u201d He rubbed his knuckles hard over his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI canna imagine a man I know to do such a thing. And yet...well, ye ken he\u2019ll do anything when he\u2019s drink taken. And he\u2019s killed before, drunk\u2014you\u2019ll mind the Customs man at the brothel?\u201d I nodded, and he leaned forward, elbows on his knees, sinking his head into his hands.</p><p>\u201cThis is different, though,\u201d he said. \u201cI canna think\u2014but maybe so. Ye ken what he said about women on the ship. And if this Mrs. Alcott was to have toyed wi\u2019 him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d I said. \u201cI saw her.\u201d</p><p>He nodded without looking up. \u201cSo did any number of other people. But if she led him to think she meant more than she maybe did, and then perhaps she put him off, maybe laughed at him...and him fu\u2019 as a puggie wi\u2019 drink, and knives to hand on every wall of the place...\u201d He sighed and sat up.</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d he said bleakly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He ran a hand backward through his hair, smoothing it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else about it. I had to tell them that I scarcely knew Willoughby\u2014that we\u2019d met him on the packet boat from Martinique, and thought it kindly to introduce him about, but didna ken a thing of where he came from, or the sort of fellow he truly was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they believe it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me wryly.</p><p>\u201cSo far. But the packet boat comes in again in six days\u2014at which point, they\u2019ll question the captain and discover that he\u2019s never laid eyes on Monsieur Etienne Alexandre and his wife, let alone a wee yellow murdering fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be a trifle awkward,\u201d I observed, thinking of Fergus and the militiaman. \u201cWe\u2019re already rather unpopular on Mr. Willoughby\u2019s account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to what we will be, if six days pass and they havena found him,\u201d he assured me. \u201cSix days is also maybe as long as it will take for gossip to spread from Blue Mountain House to Kingston about the MacIvers\u2019 visitors\u2014for ye ken the servants there all know who we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>He smiled briefly at that, and my heart turned over to see it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a nice way wi\u2019 words, Sassenach. Aye, well, all it means is that we must find Ian within six days. I shall go to Rose Hall at once, but I think I must just have a wee rest before setting out.\u201d He yawned widely behind his hand and shook his head, blinking.</p><p>We didn\u2019t speak again until after we had arrived at Blue Mountain House and made our way on tiptoe through the slumbering house to our room.</p><p>I changed in the dressing room, dropping the heavy stays on the floor with relief, and taking out the pins to let my hair fall free. Wearing only a silk chemise, I came into the bedroom, to see Jamie standing by the French door in his shirt, looking out over the lagoon.</p><p>He turned when he heard me, and beckoned, putting a finger to his lips.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome see,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>There was a small herd of manatees in the lagoon, big gray bodies gliding under the dark crystal water, rising gleaming like smooth, wet rocks. Birds were beginning to call in the trees near the house; besides this, the only sound was the frequent whoosh of the manatees\u2019 breath as they rose for air, and now and then an eerie sound like a hollow, distant wail, as they called to each other.</p><p>We watched them in silence, side by side. The lagoon began to turn green as the first rays of sun touched its surface. In that state of extreme fatigue where every sense is preternaturally heightened, I was as aware of Jamie as though I were touching him.</p><p>John Grey\u2019s revelations had relieved me of most of my fears and doubts\u2014and yet there remained the fact that Jamie had not told me about his son. Of course he had reasons\u2014and good ones\u2014for his secrecy, but did he not think he could trust me to keep his secret? It occurred to me suddenly that perhaps he had kept quiet because of the boy\u2019s mother. Perhaps he had loved her, in spite of Grey\u2019s impressions.</p> <p>She was dead; could it matter if he had? The answer was that it did. I had thought Jamie dead for twenty years, and it had made no difference at all in what I felt for him. What if he had loved this young English girl in such a way? I swallowed a small lump in my throat, trying to find the courage to ask him.</p><p>His face was abstracted, a small frown creasing his forehead, despite the dawning beauty of the lagoon.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I asked at last, unable to ask for reassurance, fearing to ask for the truth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only that I had a thought,\u201d he answered, still staring out at the manatees. \u201cAbout Willoughby, aye?\u201d</p><p>The events of the night seemed far away and unimportant. Yet murder had been done.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldna think at first that Willoughby could do such a thing\u2014how could any man?\u201d He paused, drawing a finger through the light mist of condensation that formed on the windowpanes as the sun rose. \u201cAnd yet...\u201d He turned to face me.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I can see.\u201d His face was troubled. \u201cHe was alone\u2014verra much alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stranger, in a strange land,\u201d I said quietly, remembering the poems, painted in the open secrecy of bold black ink, sent flying toward a long-lost home, committed to the sea on wings of white paper.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s it.\u201d He stopped to think, rubbing a hand slowly through his hair, gleaming copper in the new daylight. \u201cAnd when a man is alone that way\u2014well, it\u2019s maybe no decent to say it, but making love to a woman is maybe the only thing will make him forget it for a time.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, turning his hands over, stroking the length of his scarred middle finger with the index finger of his left hand.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what made me wed Laoghaire,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNot Jenny\u2019s nagging. Not pity for her or the wee lassies. Not even a pair of aching balls.\u201d His mouth turned up briefly at one corner, then relaxed. \u201cOnly needing to forget I was alone,\u201d he finished softly.</p><p>He turned restlessly, back to the window.</p><p>\u201cSo I am thinking that if the Chinee came to her, wanting that\u2014needing that\u2014and she wouldna take him...\u201d He shrugged, staring out across the cool green of the lagoon. \u201cAye, maybe he could have done it,\u201d he said.</p><p>I stood beside him. Out in the center of the lagoon, a single manatee drifted lazily to the surface, turning on her back to hold the infant on her chest toward the sunlight.</p><p>He was silent for several minutes, and I was as well, not knowing how to take the conversation back to what I had seen and heard at Government House.</p><p>I felt rather than saw him swallow, and he turned from the window to face me. There were lines of tiredness in his face, but his expression was filled with a sort of determination\u2014the sort of look he wore facing battle.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said, and at once I stiffened. He called me by my name only when he was most serious. \u201cClaire, I must tell ye something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I had been trying to think how to ask, but suddenly I didn\u2019t want to hear. I took half a step back, away from him, but he grabbed my arm.</p> <p>He had something hidden in his fist. He took my unresisting hand and put the object into it. Without looking, I knew what it was; I could feel the carving of the delicate oval frame and the slight roughness of the painted surface.</p><p>\u201cClaire.\u201d I could see the slight tremor at the side of his throat as he swallowed. \u201cClaire\u2014I must tell ye. I have a son.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, but opened my hand. There it was; the same face I had seen in Grey\u2019s office, a childish, cocky version of the man before me.</p><p>\u201cI should ha\u2019 told ye before.\u201d He was searching my face for some clue to my feelings, but for once, my giveaway countenance must have been perfectly blank. \u201cI would have\u2014only\u2014\u201d He took a deep breath for strength to go on.</p><p>\u201cI havena ever told anyone about him,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even Jenny.\u201d</p><p>That startled me enough to speak.</p><p>\u201cJenny doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and turned away to watch the manatees. Alarmed by our voices, they had retreated a short distance, but then had settled down again, feeding on the water weed at the edge of the lagoon.</p><p>\u201cIt was in England. It\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s\u2014I couldna say he was mine. He\u2019s a bastard, aye?\u201d It might have been the rising sun that flushed his cheeks. He bit his lip and went on.</p><p>\u201cI havena seen him since he was a wee lad. I never will see him again\u2014except it might be in a wee painting like this.\u201d He took the small picture from me, cradling it in the palm of his hand like a baby\u2019s head. He blinked, head bent over it.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid to tell ye,\u201d he said, low-voiced. \u201cFor fear ye would think that perhaps I\u2019d gone about spawning a dozen bastards...for fear ye\u2019d think that I wouldna care for Brianna so much, if ye kent I had another child. But I do care, Claire\u2014a great deal more than I can tell ye.\u201d He lifted his head and looked directly at me.</p><p>\u201cWill ye forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d The words almost choked me, but I had to say them. \u201cDid you love her?\u201d</p><p>An extraordinary expression of sadness crossed his face, but he didn\u2019t look away.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShe...wanted me. I should have found a way\u2014should have stopped her, but I could not. She wished me to lie wi\u2019 her. And I did, and...she died of it.\u201d He did look down then, long lashes hiding his eyes. \u201cI am guilty of her death, before God; perhaps the more guilty\u2014because I did not love her.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything, but put up a hand to touch his cheek. He pressed his own hand over it, hard, and closed his eyes. There was a gecko on the wall beside us, nearly the same color as the yellow plaster behind it, beginning to glow in the gathering daylight.</p><p>\u201cWhat is he like?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cYour son?\u201d</p><p>He smiled slightly, without opening his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s spoilt and stubborn,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIll-mannered. Loud. Wi\u2019 a wicked temper.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cAnd braw and bonny and canty and strong,\u201d he said, so softly I could barely hear him.</p><p>\u201cAnd yours,\u201d I said. His hand tightened on mine, holding it against the soft stubble of his cheek.</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d he said. He took a deep breath, and I could see the glitter of tears under his closed lids.</p><p>\u201cYou should have trusted me,\u201d I said at last. He nodded, slowly, then opened his eyes, still holding my hand.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd yet I kept thinking\u2014how should I tell ye everything, about Geneva, and Willie, and John\u2014will ye know about John?\u201d He frowned slightly, then relaxed as I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe told me. About everything.\u201d His brows rose, but he went on.</p><p>\u201cEspecially after ye found out about Laoghaire. How could I tell ye, and expect ye to know the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneva\u2014Willie\u2019s mother\u2014she wanted my body,\u201d he said softly, watching the gecko\u2019s pulsing sides. \u201cLaoghaire needed my name, and the work of my hands to keep her and her bairns.\u201d He turned his head then, dark blue eyes fixed on mine. \u201cJohn\u2014well.\u201d He lifted his shoulders and let them drop. \u201cI couldna give him what he wanted\u2014and he is friend enough not to ask it.</p><p>\u201cBut how shall I tell ye all these things,\u201d he said, the line of his mouth twisting. \u201cAnd then say to you\u2014it is only you I have ever loved? How should you believe me?\u201d</p><p>The question hung in the air between us, shimmering like the reflection from the water below.</p><p>\u201cIf you say it,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d He sounded faintly astonished. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re an honest man, Jamie Fraser,\u201d I said, smiling so that I wouldn\u2019t cry. \u201cAnd may the Lord have mercy on you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you,\u201d he said, so softly I could barely hear him. \u201cTo worship ye with my body, give ye all the service of my hands. To give ye my name, and all my heart and soul with it. Only you. Because ye will not let me lie\u2014and yet ye love me.\u201d</p><p>I did touch him then.</p><p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I said softly, and laid my hand on his arm. \u201cYou aren\u2019t alone anymore.\u201d</p><p>He turned then and took me by the arms, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cI swore to you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen we married. I didn\u2019t mean it then, but I swore\u2014and now I mean it.\u201d I turned his hand over in both mine, feeling the thin, smooth skin at the base of his wrist, where the pulse beat under my fingers, where the blade of his dirk had cut his flesh once, and spilled his blood to mingle with mine forever.</p><p>I pressed my own wrist against his, pulse to pulse, heartbeat to heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cBlood of my blood...\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cBone of my bone.\u201d His whisper was deep and husky. He knelt quite suddenly before me, and put his folded hands in mine; the gesture a Highlander makes when swearing loyalty to his chieftain.</p><p>\u201cI give ye my spirit,\u201d he said, head bent over our hands.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Til our life shall be done,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t done yet, Jamie, is it?\u201d</p><p>Then he rose and took the shift from me, and I lay back on the narrow bed naked, pulled him down to me through the soft yellow light, and took him home, and home, and home again, and we were neither one of us alone.</p><p>60</p><p>THE SCENT OF GEMSTONES</p><p>Rose Hall was ten miles out of Kingston, up a steep and winding road of reddish dust that led into blue mountains. The road was overgrown, so narrow that we must ride in single file most of the way. I followed Jamie through the dark, sweet-scented caverns of cedar boughs, under trees nearly a hundred feet high. Huge ferns grew in the shade below, the fiddleheads nearly the size of real violin necks.</p><p>Everything was quiet, save for the calling of birds in the shrubbery\u2014and even that fell silent as we passed. Jamie\u2019s horse stopped dead, once, and backed up, snorting; we waited as a tiny green snake wriggled across the path and into the undergrowth. I looked after it, but could see no farther than ten feet from the edge of the road; everything beyond was cool green shadow. I half-hoped that Mr. Willoughby had come this way\u2014no one would ever find him, in a place like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Chinaman had not been found in spite of an intensive search of the town by the island militia. The special detachment of marines from the barracks on Antigua was expected to arrive tomorrow. In the meantime, every house in Kingston was shut up like a bank vault, the owners armed to the teeth.</p><p>The mood of the town was thoroughly dangerous. Like the naval officers; it was the militia colonel\u2019s opinion that if the Chinaman were found, he would be lucky to survive long enough to be hanged.</p><p>\u201cBe torn to pieces, I expect,\u201d Colonel Jacobs had said as he escorted us from the Residence on the night of the murder. \u201cHave his balls ripped off and thrust down his stinking throat, I daresay,\u201d he added, with obvious grim satisfaction at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d Jamie had murmured in French, assisting me into the carriage. I knew that the question of Mr. Willoughby was still troubling him; he had been quiet and thoughtful on the ride through the mountains. And yet there was nothing we could do. If the little Chinese was innocent, we could not save him; if he was guilty, we could not give him up. The best we might hope for was that he would not be found.</p> <p>And in the meantime, we had five days to find Young Ian. If he were indeed at Rose Hall, all might be well. If he were not...</p><p>A fence and small gate marked the division of the plantation from the surrounding forest. Inside, the ground had been cleared, and planted in sugarcane and coffee. Some distance from the house, on a separate rise, a large, plain, mud-daub building stood, roofed with palm thatch. Dark-skinned people were going in and out, and the faint, cloying scent of burnt sugar hung over the place.</p><p>Below the refinery\u2014or so I assumed the building to be\u2014stood a large sugar press. A primitive-looking affair, this consisted of a pair of huge timbers crossed in the shape of an X, set on an enormous spindle, surmounting the boxlike body of the press. Two or three men were clambering over the press, but it was not working at present; the oxen who drove it were hobbled some distance away, grazing.</p><p>\u201cHow do they ever get the sugar down from here?\u201d I asked curiously, thinking of the narrow trail we had come up. \u201cOn mules?\u201d I brushed cedar needles off the shoulders of my coat, making myself presentable.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie answered absently. \u201cThey send it down the river on barges. The river\u2019s just over there, down the wee pass ye can see beyond the house.\u201d He pointed with his chin, reining up with one hand, and using the other to beat the dust of travel from the skirts of his coat.</p> <p>\u201cReady, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Rose Hall was a two-storied house; long and graciously proportioned, with a roof laid in expensive slates, rather than in the sheets of tin that covered most of the planters\u2019 residences. A long veranda ran all along one side of the house, with long windows and French doors opening on to it.</p><p>A great yellow rosebush grew by the front door, climbing on a trellis and spilling over the edge of the roof. The scent of its perfume was so heady that it made breathing difficult; or perhaps it was only excitement that made my breath come short and stick in my throat. I glanced around as we waited for the door to be answered, trying to catch a glimpse of any white-skinned figure near the sugar refinery above.</p><p>\u201cYes, sah?\u201d A middle-aged slave woman opened the door, looking out curiously at us. She was wide-bodied, dressed in a white cotton smock, with a red turban wrapped round her head, and her skin was the deep, rich gold in the heart of the flowers on the trellis.</p><p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Malcolm, to call upon Mrs. Abernathy, if ye please,\u201d Jamie said politely. The woman looked rather taken aback, as though callers were not a common occurrence, but after a moment\u2019s indecision, she nodded and stepped back, swinging the door wide.</p> <p>\u201cYou be waitin\u2019 in the salon, please, sah,\u201d she said, in a soft lilt that made it \u201csallong.\u201d \u201cI be askin\u2019 the mistress will she see you.\u201d</p><p>It was a large room, long and graciously proportioned, lit by huge casement windows all down one side. At the far end of the room was the fireplace, an enormous structure with a stone overmantel and a hearth of polished slates that occupied nearly the whole wall. You could have roasted an ox in it without the slightest difficulty, and the presence of a large spit suggested that the owner of the house did so on occasion.</p><p>The slave had shown us to a wicker sofa and invited us to be seated. I sat, looking about, but Jamie strolled restlessly about the room, peering through the windows that gave a view of the cane fields below the house.</p><p>It was an odd room; comfortably furnished with wicker and rattan furniture, well-equipped with fat, soft cushions, but ornamented with small, uncommon curios. On one window ledge sat a row of silver handbells, graduated from small to large. Several squat figures of stone and terra-cotta sat together on the table by my elbow; some sort of primitive fetishes or idols.</p><p>All of them were in the shape of women, hugely pregnant, or with enormous, rounded br**sts and exaggerated hips, and all with a vivid and mildly disturbing sexuality about them. It was not a prudish age, by any means, but I wouldn\u2019t have expected to find such objects in a drawing room in any age.</p><p>Somewhat more orthodox were the Jacobite relics. A silver snuffbox, a glass flagon, a decorated fan, a large serving platter\u2014even the large woven rug on the floor; all decorated with the square white rose of the Stuarts. That wasn\u2019t so odd\u2014a great many Jacobites who had fled Scotland after Culloden had come to the West Indies to seek the repair of their fortunes. I found the sight encouraging. A householder with Jacobite sympathies might be welcoming to a fellow Scot, and willing to oblige in the matter of Ian. If he\u2019s here, a small voice in my head warned.</p><p>Steps sounded in the inner part of the house, and there was a flutter at the door by the hearth. Jamie made a small grunting sound, as though someone had hit him, and I looked up, to see the mistress of the house step into the room.</p><p>I rose to my feet, and the small silver cup I had picked up fell to the floor with a clank.</p> <p>\u201cKept your girlish figure, I see, Claire.\u201d Her head was tilted to one side, green eyes gleaming with amusement.</p><p>I was too paralyzed with surprise to respond aloud, but the thought drifted through my stunned mind that I couldn\u2019t say the same for her.</p><p>Geillis Duncan had always had a voluptuous abundance of creamy bosom and a generous swell of rounded hip. While still creamy-skinned, she was considerably more abundant and generous, in every dimension visible. She wore a loose muslin gown, under which the soft, thick flesh wobbled and swayed as she moved. The delicate bones of her face had long since been submerged in swelling plumpness, but the brilliant green eyes were the same, filled with malice and humor.</p><p>I took a deep breath, and got my voice back.</p><p>\u201cI trust you won\u2019t take this the wrong way,\u201d I said, sinking slowly back onto the wicker sofa, \u201cbut why aren\u2019t you dead?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the silver in her voice as clear as a young girl\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThink I should have been, do you? Well, you\u2019re no the first\u2014and I daresay you\u2019ll not be the last to think so, either.\u201d</p><p>Eyes creased to bright green triangles by amusement, she sank into her own chair, nodded casually to Jamie, and clapped her hands sharply to summon a servant. \u201cShall we have a dish of tea?\u201d she asked me. \u201cDo, and I\u2019ll read the leaves in your cup for ye, after. I\u2019ve a reputation as a reader, after all; a fine teller o\u2019 the future, to be sure\u2014and why not?\u201d She laughed again, plump cheeks pinkening with mirth. If she had been as shocked by my appearance as I was at hers, she disguised it masterfully.</p><p>\u201cTea,\u201d she said, to the black maidservant who appeared in response to the summons. \u201cThe special kind in the blue tin, aye? And the bittie cakes wi\u2019 the nuts in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take a bite?\u201d she asked, turning back to me. \u201c\u2019Tis something of an occasion, after all. I did wonder,\u201d she said, tilting her head to one side, like a gull judging the chances of snatching a fish, \u201cwhether our paths might cross again, after that day at Cranesmuir.\u201d</p><p>My heart was beginning to slow, the shock overcome in a great wave of curiosity. I could feel the questions bubbling up by the dozens, and picked one off the top at random.</p><p>\u201cDid you know me?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhen you met me in Cranesmuir?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, the strands of cream-white hair coming loose from their pins and sliding down her neck. She poked haphazardly at her knot, still surveying me with interest.</p><p>\u201cNot at the first, no. Though sure and I thought there was a great strangeness about ye\u2014not that I was the only one to think that. Ye didna come through the stones prepared, did ye? Not on purpose, I mean?\u201d</p><p>I bit back the words, \u201cNot that time,\u201d and said instead, \u201cNo, it was an accident. You came on purpose, though\u2014from 1967?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, studying me intently. The thickened flesh between her brows was creased, and the crease deepened slightly as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cAye\u2014to help Prince Tearlach.\u201d Her mouth twisted to one side, as though she tasted something bad, and quite suddenly, she turned her head and spat. The globule of saliva hit the polished wooden floor with an audible plop.</p><p>\u201cAn gealtaire salach Atailteach!\u201d she said. \u201cFilthy Italian coward!\u201d Her eyes darkened and shone with no pleasant light. \u201cHad I known, I should have made my way to Rome and killed him, while there was time. His brother Henry might ha\u2019 been no better, though\u2014a ballock-less, sniveling priest, that one. Not that it made a difference. After Culloden, any Stuart would be as useless as another.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, and shifted her bulk, the rattan of the chair creaking beneath her. She waved a hand impatiently, dismissing the Stuarts.</p><p>\u201cStill, that\u2019s done with for now. Ye came by accident\u2014walked through the stones near the date of a Fire Feast, did ye? That\u2019s how it usually happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, startled. \u201cI came through on Beltane. But what do you mean, \u2018usually happens\u2019? Have you met a great many others\u2014like...us?\u201d I ended hesitantly.</p><p>She shook her head rather absently. \u201cNot many.\u201d She seemed to be pondering something, though perhaps it was only the absence of her refreshments; she picked up the silver bell and rang it violently.</p><p>\u201cDamn that Clotilda! Like us?\u201d she said, returning to the question at hand. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Only one besides you, that I ken. Ye could ha\u2019 knocked me over wi\u2019 a feather, when I saw the wee scar on your arm, and kent ye for one like myself.\u201d She touched the great swell of her own upper arm, where the small vaccination scar lay hidden beneath the puff of white muslin. She tilted her head in that bird-like way again, surveying me with one bright green eye.</p><p>\u201cNo, when I said that\u2019s how it usually happens, I meant, judging from the stories. Folk who disappear in fairy rings and the stone circles, I mean. They usually walk through near Beltane or Samhain; a few near the Sun Feasts\u2014Midsummer\u2019s Day or the winter solstice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the list was!\u201d I said suddenly, reminded of the gray notebook I had left with Roger Wakefield. \u201cYou had a list of dates and initials\u2014nearly two hundred of them. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I saw that the dates were mostly in late April or early May, or near the end of October.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s right.\u201d She nodded, eyes still fixed on me in speculation. \u201cSo ye found my wee book? Is that how ye knew to come and look for me on Craigh na Dun? It was you, no? That shouted my name, just before I stepped through the stones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGillian,\u201d I said, and saw her pupils widen at the name that had once been hers, though her face stayed smooth. \u201cGillian Edgars. Yes, it was me. I didn\u2019t know if you saw me in the dark.\u201d I could see in memory the night-black circle of stones\u2014and in the center, the blazing bonfire, and the figure of a slim girl standing by it, pale hair flying in the heat of the fire.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see ye,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2019Twas only later, when I heard ye call out at the witch trial and thought I\u2019d heard your voice before. And then, when I saw the mark on your arm...\u201d She shrugged massively, the muslin tight across her shoulders as she settled back. \u201cWho was with ye, that night?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cThere were two I saw\u2014a bonnie dark lad, and a girl.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, concentrating, then opened them again to stare at me.</p> <p>\u201cLater on, I thought I kent her\u2014but I couldna put a name to her, though I could swear I\u2019d seen the face. Who was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMistress Duncan? Or is it Mistress Abernathy, now?\u201d Jamie interrupted, stepping forward and bowing to her formally. The first shock of her appearance was fading, but he was still pale, his cheekbones prominent under the stretched skin of his face.</p><p>She glanced at him, then looked again, as though noticing him for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWell, and if it\u2019s no the wee fox cub!\u201d she said, looking amused. She looked him carefully up and down, noting every detail of his appearance with interest.</p><p>\u201cGrown to a bonny man, have ye no?\u201d she said. She leaned back in the chair, which creaked loudly under her weight, and squinted appraisingly at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve the look of the MacKenzies about ye, laddie. Ye always did, but now you\u2019re older, you\u2019ve the look of both your uncles in your face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am sure both Dougal and Colum would be pleased ye\u2019d remember them so well.\u201d Jamie\u2019s eyes were fixed on her as intently as hers on him. He had never liked her\u2014and was unlikely to change his opinion now\u2014but he could not afford to antagonize her; not if she had Ian here somewhere.</p><p>The arrival of the tea interrupted whatever reply she might have made. Jamie moved to my side, and sat with me on the sofa, while Geilie carefully poured the tea and handed us each a cup, behaving exactly like a conventional hostess at a tea party. As though wishing to preserve this illusion, she offered the sugar bowl and milk jug, and sat back to make light conversation.</p><p>\u201cIf ye dinna mind my asking, Mrs. Abernathy,\u201d Jamie said, \u201chow did ye come to this place?\u201d Politely left unspoken was the larger question\u2014How did you escape being burned as a witch?</p><p>She laughed, lowering her long lashes coquettishly over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, and ye\u2019ll maybe recall I was wi\u2019 child, back at Cranesmuir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall something of the sort.\u201d Jamie took a sip of his tea, the tips of his ears turning slightly pink. He had cause to remember that, all right; she had torn off her clothes in the midst of the witch trial, disclosing the secret bulge that would save her life\u2014at least temporarily.</p> <p>A small pink tongue poked out and delicately skimmed the tea droplets from her upper lip.</p><p>\u201cHave ye had children yourself?\u201d she asked, cocking an eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible chore, isn\u2019t it? Dragging about like a mud-caked sow, and then being ripped apart for the sake of something looks like a drowned rat.\u201d She shook her head, making a low noise of disgust in her throat. \u201cThe beauty o\u2019 motherhood, is it? Still, I should not complain, I suppose-the wee ratling saved my life for me. And wretched as childbirth is, it\u2019s better than being burnt at the stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d suppose so,\u201d I said, \u201cthough not having tried the latter, I couldn\u2019t say for sure.\u201d</p><p>Geillis choked in her tea, spraying brown droplets over the front of her dress. She mopped at them carelessly, eyeing me with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve not done it either, but I\u2019ve seen them burn, poppet. And I think perhaps even lyin\u2019 in a muddy hole watching your belly grow is better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey kept you in the thieves\u2019 hole all the time?\u201d The silver spoon was cool in my hand, but my palm grew sweaty at the memory of the thieves\u2019 hole in Cranesmuir. I had spent three days there with Geillis Duncan, accused as a witch. How long had she stayed there?</p> <p>\u201cThree months,\u201d she said, staring meditatively into her tea. \u201cThree mortal months of frozen feet and crawling vermin, stinking scraps of food and the grave-smell clinging to my skin day and night.\u201d</p><p>She looked up then, mouth twisting in bitter amusement. \u201cBut I bore the child in style, at the end. When my pains began, they took me from the hole\u2014little chance I\u2019d run then, aye?\u2014and the babe was born in my own old bedroom; in the fiscal\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were slightly clouded, and I wondered whether the liquid in her glass was entirely tea.</p><p>\u201cI had diamond-paned windows, do ye recall? All in shades of purple and green and white\u2014the finest house in the village.\u201d She smiled reminiscently. \u201cThey gave me the bairn to hold, and the green light fell over his face. He looked as though he was drowned indeed. I thought he should be cold to the touch, like a corpse, but he wasn\u2019t; he was warm. Warm as his father\u2019s balls.\u201d She laughed suddenly, an ugly sound.</p><p>\u201cWhy are men such fools? Ye can lead them anywhere by the cock\u2014for a while. Then give them a son and ye have them by the balls again. But it\u2019s all ye are to them, whether they\u2019re coming in or going out\u2014a cunt.\u201d</p><p>She was leaning back in her chair. At this, she spread her thighs wide, and hoisted her glass in ironic toast above her pubic bone, squinting down across the swelling bulge of belly.</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s to it, I say! Most powerful thing in the world. The niggers know that, at least.\u201d She took a deep, careless swig of her drink. \u201cThey carve wee idols, all belly and cunt and br**sts. Same as men do where we came from\u2014you and I.\u201d She squinted at me, teeth bared in amusement. \u201cSeen the dirty mags men buy under the counters then, aye?\u201d</p><p>The bloodshot green eyes swiveled to Jamie. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll know the pictures and the books the men pass about among themselves in Paris now, won\u2019t ye, fox? It\u2019s all the same.\u201d She waved a hand and drank again, deeply. \u201cThe only difference is the niggers have the decency to worship it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra perceptive of them,\u201d Jamie said calmly. He was sitting back in his chair, long legs stretched out in apparent relaxation, but I could see the tension in the fingers of the hand that gripped his own cup. \u201cAnd how d\u2019ye ken the pictures men look at in Paris, Mistress\u2014Abernathy, is it now?\u201d</p><p>She might be tipsy, but was by no means fuddled. She looked up sharply at the tone of his voice, and gave him a twisted smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mistress Abernathy will do well enough. When I lived in Paris, I had another name\u2014Madame Melisande Robicheaux. Like that one? I thought it a bit grand, but your uncle Dougal gave it me, so I kept it\u2014out of sentiment.\u201d</p><p>My free hand curled into a fist, out of sight in the folds of my skirt. I had heard of Madame Melisande, when we lived in Paris. Not a part of society, she had had some fame as a seer of the future; ladies of the court consulted her in deepest secrecy, for advice on their love lives, their investments, and their pregnancies.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you could have told the ladies some interesting things,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>Her laugh this time was truly amused. \u201cOh, I could, indeed! Seldom did, though. Folk don\u2019t usually pay for the truth, ye know. Sometimes, though\u2014did ye ken that Jean-Paul Marat\u2019s mother meant to name her bairn Rudolphe? I told her I thought Rudolphe was ill-omened. I wondered now and then about that\u2014would he grow up a revolutionary with a name like Rudolphe, or would he take it all out in writing poems, instead? Ever think that, fox\u2014that a name might make a difference?\u201d Her eyes were fixed on Jamie, green glass.</p><p>\u201cOften,\u201d he said, and set down his cup. \u201cIt was Dougal got ye away from Cranesmuir, then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, stifling a small belch. \u201cAye. He came to take the babe\u2014alone, for fear someone would find out he was the father, aye? I wouldna let it go, though. And when he came near to wrest it from me\u2014why, I snatched the dirk from his belt and pressed it to the child\u2019s throat.\u201d A small smile of satisfaction at the memory curved her lovely lips.</p><p>\u201cTold him I\u2019d kill it, sure, unless he swore on his brother\u2019s life and his own soul to get me safe away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he believed you?\u201d I felt mildly ill at the thought of any mother holding a knife to the throat of her newborn child, even in pretense.</p><p>Her gaze swiveled back to me. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said softly, and the smile widened. \u201cHe knew me, did Dougal.\u201d</p><p>Sweating, even in the chill of December, and unable to take his eyes off the tiny face of his sleeping son, Dougal had agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhen he leaned over me to take the child, I thought of plunging the dirk into his own throat instead,\u201d she said, reminiscently. \u201cBut it would have been a good deal harder to get away by myself, so I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but he picked up his tea and took a deep swallow.</p><p>Dougal had summoned the locksman, John MacRae, and the church sexton, and by means of discreet bribery, insured that the hooded figure dragged on a hurdle to the pitch barrel next morning would not be that of Geillis Duncan.</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d use straw, maybe,\u201d she said, \u201cbut he was a cleverer man than that. Auld Grannie Joan MacKenzie had died three days before, and was meant to be burying that same afternoon. A few rocks in the coffin and the lid nailed down tight, and Bob\u2019s your uncle, eh? A real body, fine for burning.\u201d She laughed, and gulped the last swallow of her drink.</p><p>\u201cNot everyone\u2019s seen their own funeral; fewer still ha\u2019 seen their own execution, aye?\u201d</p><p>It had been the dead of winter, and the small grove of rowan trees outside the village stood bare, drifted with their own dead leaves, the dried red berries showing here and there on the ground like spots of blood.</p><p>It was a cloudy day, with the promise of sleet or snow, but the whole village turned out nonetheless; a witch-burning was not an event to be missed. The village priest, Father Bain, had died himself three months before, of fever brought on by a festering sore, but a new priest had been imported for the occasion from a village nearby. Perfuming his way with a censer held before him, the priest had come down the path to the grove, chanting the service for the dead. Behind him came the locksman and his two assistants, dragging the hurdle and its black-robed burden.</p><p>\u201cI expect Grannie Joan would have been pleased,\u201d Geilie said, white teeth gleaming at the vision. \u201cShe couldna have expected more nor four or five people to her burying\u2014as it was, she had the whole village, and the incense and special prayers to boot!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MacRae had untied the body and carried it, lolling, to the barrel of pitch ready waiting.</p><p>\u201cThe court granted me the mercy to be weirrit before the burning,\u201d Geillis explained ironically. \u201cSo they expected the body to be dead\u2014no difficulty there, if I was strangled already. The only thing anyone might ha\u2019 seen was that Grannie Joan weighed half what I did, newly delivered as I was, but no one seemed to notice she was light in MacRae\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there?\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded smugly. \u201cOh, aye. Well muffled in a cloak\u2014everyone was, because o\u2019 the weather\u2014but I wouldna have missed it.\u201d</p> <p>As the priest finished his last prayer against the evils of enchantment, MacRae had taken the pine torch from his assistant and stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cGod, omit not this woman from Thy covenant, and the many evils that she in the body committed,\u201d he had said, and flung the fire into the pitch.</p><p>\u201cIt was faster than I thought it would be,\u201d Geillis said, sounding mildly surprised. \u201cA great whoosh! of fire\u2014there was a blast of hot air and a cheer from the crowd, and naught to be seen but the flames, shooting up high enough to singe the rowan branches overhead.\u201d</p><p>The fire had subsided within a minute, though, and the dark figure within was clear enough to be seen through the pale daylight flames. The hood and the hair had burned away with the first scorching rush, and the face itself was burned beyond recognition. A few moments more, and the clean dark shapes of the bones emerged from the melted flesh, an airy superstructure rising above the charring barrel.</p><p>\u201cOnly great empty holes where her eyes had been,\u201d she said. The moss-green eyes turned toward me, clouded by memory. \u201cI thought perhaps she was looking at me. But then the skull exploded, and it was all over, and folk began to come away\u2014all except a few who stayed in hopes of picking up a bit of bone as a keepsake.\u201d</p> <p>She rose and went unsteadily to the small table near the window. She picked up the silver bell and rang it, hard.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said, her back turned to us. \u201cChildbirth is maybe easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Dougal got ye away to France,\u201d Jamie said. The fingers of his right hand twitched slightly. \u201cHow came ye here to the West Indies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was later,\u201d she said carelessly. \u201cAfter Culloden.\u201d She turned then, and smiled from Jamie to me.</p><p>\u201cAnd what might bring the two of ye here to this place? Surely not the pleasure of my company?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jamie, seeing the slight tensing of his back as he sat up straighter. His face stayed calm, though, only his eyes bright with wariness.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve come to seek a young kinsman of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cMy nephew, Ian Murray. We\u2019ve some reason to think he is indentured here.\u201d</p><p>Geilie\u2019s pale brows rose high, making soft ridges in her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIan Murray?\u201d she said, and shook her head in puzzlement. \u201cI\u2019ve no indentured whites at all, here. No whites, come to that. The only free man on the place is the overseer, and he\u2019s what they call a griffone; one-quarter black.\u201d</p><p>Unlike me, Geillis Duncan was a very good liar. Impossible to tell, from her expression of mild interest, whether she had ever heard the name Ian Murray before. But lying she was, and I knew it.</p><p>Jamie knew it, too; the expression that flashed through his eyes was not disappointment, but fury, quickly suppressed.</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d he said politely. \u201cAnd are ye not fearful, then, alone wi\u2019 your slaves here, so far from town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>She smiled broadly at him, then lifted her double chin and waggled it gently in the direction of the terrace behind him. I turned my head, and saw that the French door was filled from jamb to doorpost with an immense black man, several inches taller than Jamie, from whose rolled-up shirt sleeves protruded arms like tree trunks, knotted with muscle.</p> <p>\u201cMeet Hercules,\u201d Geilie said, with a tiny laugh. \u201cHe has a twin brother, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamed Atlas, by chance?\u201d I asked, with an edge to my voice.</p><p>\u201cYou guessed! Is she no the clever one, eh, fox?\u201d She winked conspiratorially at Jamie, the rounded flesh of her cheek wobbling with the movement. The light caught her from the side as she turned her head, and I saw the red spiderwebs of tiny broken capillaries that netted her jowls.</p><p>Hercule took no note of this, or of anything else. His broad face was slack and dull, and there was no life in the deep-sunk eyes beneath the bony brow ridge. It gave me a very uneasy feeling to look at him, and not only because of his threatening size; looking at him was like passing by a haunted house, where something lurks behind blind windows.</p><p>\u201cThat will do, Hercule; ye can go back to work now.\u201d Geilie picked up the silver bell and tinkled it gently, once. Without a word, the giant turned and lumbered off the veranda. \u201cI have no fear o\u2019 the slaves,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid o\u2019 me, for they think I\u2019m a witch. Verra funny, considering, is it not?\u201d Her eyes twinkled behind little pouches of fat.</p><p>\u201cGeilie\u2014that man.\u201d I hesitated, feeling ridiculous in asking such a question. \u201cHe\u2019s not a\u2014a zombie?\u201d</p><p>She laughed delightedly at that, clapping her hands together.</p><p>\u201cChrist, a zombie? Jesus, Claire!\u201d She chortled with glee, a bright pink rising from throat to hair roots.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell ye, he\u2019s no verra bright,\u201d she said at last, still gasping and wheezing. \u201cBut he\u2019s no dead, either!\u201d and went off into further gales of laughter.</p><p>Jamie stared at me, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cZombie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I said, my face nearly as pink as Geilie\u2019s. \u201cHow many slaves have you got here?\u201d I asked, wanting to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cHee hee,\u201d she said, winding down into giggles. \u201cOh, a hundred or so. It\u2019s no such a big place. Only three hundred acres in cane, and a wee bit of coffee on the upper slopes.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a lace-trimmed handkerchief from her pocket and patted her damp face, sniffing a bit as she regained her composure. I could feel, rather than see, Jamie\u2019s tension. I was sure he was as convinced as I that Geilie knew something about Ian Murray\u2014if nothing else, she had betrayed no surprise whatever at our appearance. Someone had told her about us, and that someone could only be Ian.</p><p>The thought of threatening a woman to extract information wasn\u2019t one that would come naturally to Jamie, but it would to me. Unfortunately, the presence of the twin pillars of Hercules had put a stop to that line of thought. The next best idea seemed to be to search the house and grounds for any trace of the boy. Three hundred acres was a fair piece of ground, but if he was on the property, he would likely be in or near the buildings\u2014the house, the sugar refinery, or the slave quarters.</p><p>I came out of my thoughts to realize that Geilie had asked me a question.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d she repeated patiently, \u201cthat ye had a great deal of talent for the healing when I knew ye in Scotland; you\u2019ll maybe know more now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect I might.\u201d I looked her over cautiously. Did she want my skill for herself? She wasn\u2019t healthy; a glance at her mottled complexion and the dark circles beneath her eyes was enough to show that. But was she actively ill?</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d she said, seeing my look. \u201cNot just now, anyway. I\u2019ve two slaves gone sick. Maybe ye\u2019d be so kind as to look at them?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Jamie, who gave me the shadow of a nod. It was a chance to get into the slave quarters and look for Ian.</p><p>\u201cI saw when we came in as ye had a bit of trouble wi\u2019 your sugar press,\u201d he said, rising abruptly. He gave Geilie a cool nod. \u201cPerhaps I shall have a look at it, whilst you and my wife tend the sick.\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he took off his coat and hung it on the peg by the door. He went out by the veranda, rolling up the sleeves of his shirt, sunlight glinting on his hair.</p><p>\u201cA handy sort, is he?\u201d Geilie looked after him, amused. \u201cMy husband Barnabas was that sort\u2014couldna keep his hands off any kind of machine. Or off the slave girls, either,\u201d she added. \u201cCome along, the sick ones are back o\u2019 the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen was in a separate small building of its own, connected to the house by a breezeway covered with blooming jasmine. Walking through it was like floating through a cloud of perfume, surrounded by a hum of bees loud enough to be felt on the skin, like the low drone of a bagpipe.</p><p>\u201cEver been stung?\u201d Geillis swiped casually at a low-flying furry body, batting it out of the air.</p><p>\u201cNow and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have I,\u201d she said. \u201cAny number of times, and nothing worse than a red welt on my skin to show for it. One of these wee buggers stung one o\u2019 the kitchen slaves last spring, though, and the wench swelled up like a toad and died, right before my eyes!\u201d She glanced at me, eyes wide and mocking. \u201cDid wonders for my reputation, I can tell ye. The rest o\u2019 the slaves put it about I\u2019d witched the lass; put a spell on her to kill her for burning the sponge cake. I havena had so much as a scorched pot, since.\u201d Shaking her head, she waved away another bee.</p><p>While appalled at her callousness, I was somewhat relieved by the story. Perhaps the other gossip I had heard at the Governor\u2019s ball had as little foundation in fact.</p><p>I paused, looking out through the jasmine\u2019s lacy leaves at the cane fields below. Jamie was in the clearing by the sugar press, looking up at the gigantic crossbars of the machine while a man I assumed to be the overseer pointed and explained. As I watched, he said something, gesturing, and the overseer nodded emphatically, waving his hands in voluble reply. If I didn\u2019t find any trace of Ian in the kitchen quarters, perhaps Jamie would learn something from the overseer. Despite Geilie\u2019s denials, every instinct I had insisted that the boy was here\u2014somewhere.</p><p>There was no sign of him in the kitchen itself; only three or four women, kneading bread and snapping peas, who looked up curiously as we came through. I caught the eye of one young woman, and nodded and smiled at her; perhaps I would have a chance to come back and talk, later. Her eyes widened in surprise, and she bent her head at once, eyes on the bowl of peapods in her lap. I saw her steal a quick glance at me as we crossed the long room, and noticed that she balanced the bowl in front of the small bulge of an early pregnancy.</p><p>The first sick slave was in a small pantry off the kitchen itself, lying on a pallet laid under shelves stacked high with gauze-wrapped cheeses. The patient, a young man in his twenties, sat up blinking at the sudden ray of light when I opened the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble with him?\u201d I knelt down beside the man and touched his skin. Warm, damp, no apparent fever. He didn\u2019t seem in any particular distress, merely blinking sleepily as I examined him.</p><p>\u201cHe has a worm.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Geilie in surprise. From what I had seen and heard so far in the islands, I thought it likely that at least three-quarters of the black population\u2014and not a few of the whites\u2014suffered from internal parasites. Nasty and debilitating as these could be, though, most were actively threatening only to the very young and the very old. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably a lot more than one,\u201d I said. I pushed the slave gently onto his back and began to palpate his stomach. The spleen was tender and slightly enlarged\u2014also a common finding here\u2014but I felt no suspicious masses in the abdomen that might indicate a major intestinal infestation. \u201cHe seems moderately healthy; why have you got him in here in the dark?\u201d</p><p>As though in answer to my question, the slave suddenly wrenched himself away from my hand, let out a piercing scream, and rolled up into a ball. Rolling and unrolling himself like a yo-yo, he reached the wall and began to bang his head against it, still screaming. Then, as suddenly as the fit had come on, it passed off, and the young man sank back onto the pallet, panting heavily and soaked with sweat.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA loa-loa worm,\u201d Geilie said, looking amused at my reaction. \u201cThey live in the eyeballs, just under the lining. They cross back and forth, from one eye to the other, and when they go across the bridge o\u2019 the nose, I\u2019m told it\u2019s rather painful.\u201d She nodded at the slave, still quivering slightly on his pallet.</p> <p>\u201cThe dark keeps them from moving so much,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fellow from Andros who told me about them says ye must catch them when they\u2019ve just come in one eye, for they\u2019re right near the surface, and ye can lift them out with a big darning needle. If ye wait, they go deeper, and ye canna get them.\u201d She turned back to the kitchen and shouted for a light.</p><p>\u201cHere, I brought the needle, just in case.\u201d She groped in the bag at her waist and drew out a square of felt, with a three-inch steel needle thrust through it, which she extended helpfully to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d I stared at her, appalled.</p><p>\u201cNo. Did ye not say ye were a good healer?\u201d she asked reasonably.</p><p>\u201cI am, but\u2014\u201d I glanced at the slave, hesitated, then took the candle one of the kitchenmaids was holding out to me.</p> <p>\u201cBring me some brandy, and a small sharp knife,\u201d I said. \u201cDip the knife\u2014and the needle\u2014in the brandy, then hold the tip in a flame for a moment. Let it cool, but don\u2019t touch it.\u201d As I spoke, I was gently pulling up one eyelid. The man\u2019s eye looked up at me, an oddly irregular, blotched brown iris in a bloodshot sclera the yellow of heavy cream. I searched carefully, bringing the candle flame close enough to shrink the pupil, then drawing it away, but saw nothing there.</p><p>I tried the other eye, and nearly dropped the candle. Sure enough, there was a small, transparent filament, moving under the conjunctiva. I gagged slightly at the sight, but controlled myself, and reached for the freshly sterilized knife, still holding back the eyelid.</p><p>\u201cTake him by the shoulders,\u201d I said to Geilie. \u201cDon\u2019t let him move, or I may blind him.\u201d</p><p>The surgery itself was horrifying to contemplate, but surprisingly simple to perform. I made one quick, small incision along the inside corner of the conjunctiva, lifted it slightly with the tip of the needle, and as the worm undulated lazily across the open field, I slipped the tip of the needle under the body and drew it out, neat as a loop of yarn.</p><p>Repressing a shudder of distaste, I flicked the worm away. It hit the wall with a tiny wet splat! and vanished in the shadows under the cheese.</p><p>There was no blood; after a brief debate with myself, I decided to leave it to the man\u2019s own tear ducts to irrigate the incision. That would have to be left to heal by itself; I had no fine sutures, and the wound was small enough not to need more than a stitch or two in any case.</p> <p>I tied a clean pad of cloth over the closed eye with a bandage round the head, and sat back, reasonably pleased with my first foray into tropical medicine.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, pushing back my hair. \u201cWhere\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p><p>The next patient was in a shed outside the kitchen, dead. I squatted next to the body, that of a middle-aged man with grizzled hair, feeling both pity and outrage.</p><p>The cause of death was more than obvious: a strangulated hernia. The loop of twisted, gangrenous bowel protruded from one side of the belly, the stretched skin over it already tinged with green, though the body itself was still nearly as warm as life. An expression of agony was fixed on the broad features, and the limbs were still contorted, giving an unfortunately accurate witness to just what sort of death it had been.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait?\u201d I stood up, glaring at Geilie. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, you kept me drinking tea and chatting, while this was going on? He\u2019s been dead less than an hour, but he must have been in trouble a long time since\u2014days! Why didn\u2019t you bring me out here at once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed pretty far gone this morning,\u201d she said, not at all disturbed by my agitation. She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them so before; I didna think you could do anything much. It didna seem worth hurrying.\u201d</p><p>I choked back further recrimination. She was right; I could have operated, had I come sooner, but the chances of it doing any good were slim to nonexistent. The hernia repair was something I might have managed, even with such difficult conditions; after all, that was nothing more than pushing back the bowel protrusion and pulling the ruptured layers of abdominal muscle back together with sutures; infection was the only real danger. But once the loop of escaped intestine had twisted, so that the blood supply was cut off and the contents began to putrefy, the man was doomed.</p><p>But to allow the man to die here in this stuffy shed, alone...well, perhaps he would not have found the presence of one white woman more or less a comfort, in any case. Still, I felt an obscure sense of failure; the same I always felt in the presence of death. I wiped my hands slowly on a brandy-soaked cloth, mastering my feelings.</p> <p>One to the good, one to the bad\u2014and Ian still to be found.</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m here now, perhaps I\u2019d best have a look at the rest of your slaves,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAn ounce of prevention, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re well enough.\u201d Geilie waved a careless hand. \u201cStill, if ye want to take the time, you\u2019re welcome. Later, though; I\u2019ve a visitor coming this afternoon, and I want to talk more with ye, first. Come back to the house, now\u2014someone will take care o\u2019 this.\u201d A brief nod disposed of \u201cthis,\u201d the slave\u2019s contorted body. She linked her arm in mine, urging me out of the shed and back toward the kitchen with soft thrustings of her weight.</p><p>In the kitchen, I detached myself, motioning toward the pregnant slave, now on her hands and knees, scrubbing the hearthstones.</p><p>\u201cYou go along; I want to have a quick look at this girl. She looks a bit toxic to me\u2014you don\u2019t want her to miscarry.\u201d</p><p>Geilie gave me a curious glance, but then shrugged.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s foaled twice with no trouble, but you\u2019re the doctor. Aye, if that\u2019s your notion of fun, go ahead. Don\u2019t take too long, though; that parson said he\u2019d come at four o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>I made some pretense of examining the bewildered woman, until Geilie\u2019s draperies had disappeared into the breezeway.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a young white boy named Ian; I\u2019m his aunt. Do you know where he might be?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2014she couldn\u2019t be more than seventeen or eighteen\u2014looked startled. She blinked, and darted a glance at one of the older women, who had quit her own work and come across the room to see what was going on.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d the older woman said, shaking her head. \u201cNo white boys here. None at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d the girl obediently echoed. \u201cWe don\u2019 know nothin\u2019 \u2019bout your boy.\u201d But she hadn\u2019t said that at first, and her eyes wouldn\u2019t meet mine.</p><p>The older woman had been joined now by the other two kitchenmaids, coming to buttress her. I was surrounded by an impenetrable wall of bland ignorance, and no way to break through it. At the same time, I was aware of a current running among the women\u2014a feeling of mutual warning; of wariness and secrecy. It might be only the natural reaction to the sudden appearance of a white stranger in their domain\u2014or it might be something more.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take longer; Geilie would be coming back to look for me. I fumbled quickly in my pocket, and pulled out a silver florin, which I pressed into the girl\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIf you should see Ian, tell him that his uncle is here to find him.\u201d Not waiting for an answer, I turned and hurried out of the kitchen.</p><p>I glanced down toward the sugar mill as I passed through the breezeway. The sugar press stood abandoned, the oxen grazing placidly in the long grass at the edge of the clearing. There was no sign of Jamie or the overseer; had he come back to the house?</p><p>I came through the French windows into the salon, and stopped short. Geilie sat in her wicker chair, Jamie\u2019s coat across the arm, and the photographs of Brianna spread over her lap. She heard my step and looked up, one pale brow arched over an acid smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pretty lassie, to be sure. What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna.\u201d My lips felt stiff. I walked slowly toward her, fighting the urge to snatch the pictures from her hands and run.</p><p>\u201cLooks a great deal like her father, doesn\u2019t she? I thought she seemed familiar, that tall red-haired lass I saw that night on Craigh na Dun. He is her father, no?\u201d She inclined her head toward the door where Jamie had vanished.</p><p>\u201cYes. Give them to me.\u201d It made no difference; she had seen the pictures already. Still, I couldn\u2019t stand to see her thick white fingers cupping Brianna\u2019s face.</p><p>Her mouth twitched as though she meant to refuse, but she tapped them neatly into a square and handed them to me without demur. I held them against my chest for a moment, not knowing what to do with them, then thrust them back into the pocket of my skirt.</p><p>\u201cSit ye down, Claire. The coffee\u2019s come.\u201d She nodded toward the small table, and the chair alongside. Her eyes followed me as I moved to it, alive with calculation.</p><p>She gestured for me to pour the coffee for both of us, and took her own cup without words. We sipped silently for a few moments. The cup trembled in my hands, spilling hot liquid across my wrist. I put it down, wiping my hand on my skirt, wondering in some dim recess of my mind why I should be afraid.</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d she said suddenly. She looked at me with something akin to awe. \u201cSweet Christ Jesus, ye went through twice! Or no\u2014three times, it must have been, for here ye are now.\u201d She shook her head, marveling, never taking her bright green eyes from my face.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow could ye do it so many times, and live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I saw the look of hard skepticism flash across her face, and answered it, defensively. \u201cI don\u2019t! I just\u2014went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it not the same for you?\u201d The green eyes had narrowed into slits of concentration. \u201cWhat was it like, there between? Did ye not feel the terror? And the noise, fit to split your skull and spill your brains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was like that.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to talk to about it; didn\u2019t even like to think of the time-passage. I had blocked it deliberately from my mind, the roar of death and dissolution and the voices of chaos that urged me to join them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid ye have blood to protect you, or stones? I wouldna think ye\u2019d the nerve for blood\u2014but maybe I\u2019m wrong. For surely ye\u2019re stronger than I thought, to have done it three times, and lived through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d I shook my head, confused. \u201cNo. Nothing. I told you\u2014I...went. That\u2019s all.\u201d Then I remembered the night she had gone through the stones in 1968; the blaze of fire on Craigh na Dun, and the twisted, blackened shape in the center of that fire. \u201cGreg Edgars,\u201d I said. The name of her first husband. \u201cYou didn\u2019t just kill him because he found you and tried to stop you, did you? He was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood, aye.\u201d She was watching me, intent. \u201cI didna think it could be done at all, the crossing\u2014not without the blood.\u201d She sounded faintly amazed. \u201cThe auld ones\u2014they always used the blood. That and the fire. They built great wicker cages, filled wi\u2019 their captives, and set them alight in the circles. I thought that was how they opened the passage.\u201d</p><p>My hands and my lips felt cold, and I picked up the cup to warm them. Where in the name of God was Jamie?</p> <p>\u201cAnd ye didna use stones, either?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhat stones?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me for a moment, debating whether to tell me. Her little pink tongue flicked over her lip, and then she nodded, deciding. With a small grunt, she heaved herself up from the chair and went toward the great hearth at the far end of the room, beckoning me to follow.</p><p>She knelt, with surprising grace for one of her figure, and pressed a greenish stone set into the mantelpiece, a foot or so above the hearth. It moved slightly, and there was a soft click! as one of the hearth slates rose smoothly out of its mortared setting.</p><p>\u201cSpring mechanism,\u201d Geilie explained, lifting the slate carefully and setting it aside. \u201cA Danish fellow named Leiven from St. Croix made it for me.\u201d</p> <p>She reached into the cavity beneath and drew out a wooden box, about a foot long. There were pale brown stains on the smooth wood, and it looked swollen and split, as though it had been immersed in seawater at some time. I bit my lip hard at its appearance, and hoped my face didn\u2019t give anything away. If I had had any doubts about Ian being here, they had vanished\u2014for here, unless I was very much mistaken, was the silkies\u2019 treasure. Fortunately, Geilie wasn\u2019t looking at me, but at the box.</p><p>\u201cI learned about the stones from an Indian\u2014not a red Indian, a Hindoo from Calcutta,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe came to me, looking for thornapple, and he told me about how to make medicines from the gemstones.\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder for Jamie, but there was no sign of him. Where the hell was he? Had he found Ian, somewhere on the plantation?</p><p>\u201cYe can get the powdered stones from a London apothecary,\u201d she was saying, frowning slightly as she pushed at the sliding lid. \u201cBut they\u2019re mostly poor quality, and the bhasmas doesn\u2019t work so well. Best to have a stone at least of the second quality\u2014what they call a nagina stone. That\u2019s a goodish-sized stone that\u2019s been polished. A stone of the first quality is faceted, and unflawed for preference, but most folk canna afford to burn those to ash. The ashes of the stone are the bhasmas,\u201d she explained, turning to look up at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what ye use in the medicines. Here, can ye pry this damn thing loose? It\u2019s been spoilt in seawater, and the locking bit swells whenever the weather\u2019s damp\u2014which it is all the time, this season of the year,\u201d she added, making a face over her shoulder at the clouds rolling in over the bay, far below.</p><p>She thrust the box into my hands and rose heavily to her feet, grunting with the effort.</p><p>It was a Chinese puzzle-box, I saw; a fairly simple one, with a small sliding panel that unlocked the main lid. The problem was that the smaller panel had swollen, sticking in its slot.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck to break one,\u201d Geilie observed, watching my attempts. \u201cElse I\u2019d just smash the thing and be done with it. Here, maybe this will help.\u201d She produced a small mother-of-pearl penknife from the recesses of her gown and handed it to me, then went to the window ledge and rang another of her silver bells.</p><p>I pried gently upward with the blade of the knife. I felt it catch in the wood, and wiggled it gingerly. Little by little, the small rectangle of wood edged out of its place, until I could get hold of it between thumb and forefinger and pull it all the way loose.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d I said, handing her back the box with some reluctance. It felt heavy, and there was an unmistakable metallic chinking as I tilted it.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d As she took it, the black servingmaid came in through the far door. Geilie turned to order the girl to bring a tray of fresh tarts, and I saw that she had slipped the box between the folds of her skirts, hiding it.</p><p>\u201cNosy creatures,\u201d she said, frowning toward the departing maid\u2019s back as the girl passed through the door. \u201cOne of the difficulties wi\u2019 slaves; it\u2019s hard to have secrets.\u201d She put the box on the table, and pushed at the top; with a small, sharp skreek! of protest, the lid slid back.</p><p>She reached into the box and drew out her closed hand. She smiled mischievously at me, saying, \u201cLittle Jackie Horner sat in the corner, eating her Christmas pie. She put in her thumb, and pulled out a plum\u201d\u2014she opened her hand with a flourish\u2014\u201cand said \u2018What a good girl am I!\u2019\u201d</p><p>I had been expecting them, of course, but had no difficulty in looking impressed anyway. The reality of a gem is both more immediate and more startling than its description. Six or seven of them flashed and glimmered in her palm, flaming fire and frozen ice, the gleam of blue water in the sun, and a great gold stone like the eye of a lurking tiger.</p><p>Without meaning to, I drew near enough to look down into the well of her hand, staring with fascination. \u201cBig enough,\u201d Jamie had described them as being, with a characteristic Scottish talent for understatement. Well, smaller than a breadbox, I supposed.</p> <p>\u201cI got them for the money, to start,\u201d Geilie was saying, prodding the stones with satisfaction. \u201cBecause they were easier to carry than a great weight of gold or silver, I mean; I didna think then what other use they might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, as bhasmas?\u201d The idea of burning any of those glowing things to ash seemed a sacrilege.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not these.\u201d Her hand closed on the stones, dipped into her pocket, and back into the box for more. A small shower of liquid fire dropped into her pocket, and she patted it affectionately. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve a lot o\u2019 the smaller stones for that. These are for something else.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me speculatively, then jerked her head toward the door at the end of the room.</p><p>\u201cCome along up to my workroom,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve a few things there you\u2019ll maybe be interested to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterested\u201d was putting it mildly, I thought.</p><p>It was a long, light-filled room, with a counter down one side. Bunches of drying herbs hung from hooks overhead and lay on gauze-covered drying racks along the inner wall. Drawered cabinets and cupboards covered the rest of the wall space, and there was a small glass-fronted bookcase at the end of the room.</p><p>The room gave me a mild sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu; after a moment, I realized that it was because it strongly resembled Geilie\u2019s workroom in the village of Cranesmuir, in the house of her first husband\u2014no, second, I corrected myself, remember the flaming body of Greg Edgars.</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you been married?\u201d I asked curiously. She had begun building her fortune with her second husband, procurator fiscal of the district where they lived, forging his signature in order to divert money to her own use, and then murdering him. Successful with this modus operandi, I imagined she had tried it again; she was a creature of habit, was Geilie Duncan.</p><p>She paused a moment to count up. \u201cOh, five, I think. Since I came here,\u201d she added casually.</p><p>\u201cFive?\u201d I said, a little faintly. Not just a habit, it seemed; a positive addiction.</p><p>\u201cA verra unhealthy atmosphere for Englishmen it is in the tropics,\u201d she said, and smiled slyly at me. \u201cFevers, ulcers, festering stomachs; any little thing will carry them off.\u201d She had evidently been mindful of her oral hygiene; her teeth were still very good.</p><p>She reached out and lightly caressed a small bottle that stood on the lowest shelf. It wasn\u2019t labeled, but I had seen crude white arsenic before. On the whole, I was glad I hadn\u2019t taken any food.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll be interested in this,\u201d she said, spying a jar on an upper shelf. Grunting slightly as she stood on tiptoe, she reached it down and handed it to me.</p><p>It contained a very coarse powder, evidently a mixture of several substances, brown, yellow, and black, flecked with shreds of a semitranslucent material.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZombie poison,\u201d she said, and laughed. \u201cI thought ye\u2019d like to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said coldly. \u201cI thought you told me there was no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she corrected, still smiling. \u201cI told ye Hercule wasn\u2019t dead; and he\u2019s not.\u201d She took the jar from me and replaced it on the shelf. \u201cBut there\u2019s no denying that he\u2019s a good bit more manageable if he\u2019s had a dose of this stuff once a week, mixed with his grain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, offhanded. \u201cA bit of this and a bit of that. The main thing seems to be a kind of fish\u2014a little square thing wi\u2019 spots; verra funny-looking. Ye take the skin and dry it, and the liver as well. But there are a few other things ye put in with it\u2014I wish I kent what,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it?\u201d I stared at her. \u201cDidn\u2019t you make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I had a cook,\u201d Geilie said, \u201cor at least they sold him to me as a cook, but damned if I\u2019d feel safe eating a thing he turned out of the kitchen, the sly black devil. He was a houngan, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoungan is what the blacks call one of their medicine-priests; though to be quite right about it, I believe Ishmael said his sort of black called him an oniseegun, or somesuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIshmael, hm?\u201d I licked my dry lips. \u201cDid he come with that name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. He had some heathen name wi\u2019 six syllables, and the man who sold him called him \u2018Jimmy\u2019\u2014the auctioneers call all the bucks Jimmy. I named him Ishmael, because of the story the seller told me about him.\u201d</p><p>Ishmael had been taken from a barracoon on the Gold Coast of Africa, one of a shipment of six hundred slaves from the villages of Nigeria and Ghana, stowed between decks of the slave ship Persephone, bound for Antigua. Coming through the Caicos Passage, the Persephone had run into a sudden squall, and been run aground on Hogsty Reef, off the island of Great Inagua. The ship had broken up, with barely time for the crew to escape in the ship\u2019s boats.</p><p>The slaves, chained and helpless betweendecks, had all drowned. All but one man who had earlier been taken from the hold to assist as a galley mate, both messboys having died of the pox en route from Africa. This man, left behind by the ship\u2019s crew, had nonetheless survived the wreck by clinging to a cask of spirits, which floated ashore on Great Inagua two days later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fishermen who discovered the castaway were more interested in his means of salvation than in the slave himself. Breaking open the cask, however, they were shocked and appalled to find inside the body of a man, somewhat imperfectly preserved by the spirits in which he had been soaking.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if they drank the cr\u00e8me de menthe anyway,\u201d I murmured, having observed for myself that Mr. Overholt\u2019s assessment of the alcoholic affinities of sailors was largely correct.</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d said Geilie, mildly annoyed at having her story interrupted. \u201cIn any case, when I heard of it, I named him Ishmael straight off. Because of the floating coffin, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery clever,\u201d I congratulated her. \u201cEr...did they find out who the man in the cask was?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She shrugged carelessly. \u201cThey gave him to the Governor of Jamaica, who had him put in a glass case, wi\u2019 fresh spirits, as a curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cWell, not so much the man himself, but some odd fungi that were growing on him,\u201d Geilie explained. \u201cThe Governor\u2019s got a passion for such things. The old Governor, I mean; I hear there\u2019s a new one, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d I said, feeling a bit queasy. I thought the ex-governor was more likely to qualify as a curiosity than the dead man, on the whole.</p><p>Her back was turned, as she pulled out drawers and rummaged through them. I took a deep breath, hoping to keep my voice casual.</p> <p>\u201cThis Ishmael sounds an interesting sort; do you still have him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said indifferently. \u201cThe black bastard ran off. He\u2019s the one who made the zombie poison for me, though. Wouldn\u2019t tell me how, no matter what I did to him,\u201d she added, with a short, humorless laugh, and I had a sudden vivid memory of the weals across Ishmael\u2019s back. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t proper for women to make medicine, only men could do it. Or the verra auld women, once they\u2019d quit bleeding. Hmph!\u201d</p><p>She snorted, and reached into her pocket, pulling out a handful of stones.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, that\u2019s not what I brought ye up to show ye.\u201d</p><p>Carefully, she laid five of the stones in a rough circle on the countertop. Then she took down from a shelf a thick book, bound in worn leather.</p><p>\u201cCan ye read German?\u201d she asked, opening it carefully.</p> <p>\u201cNot much, no,\u201d I said. I moved closer, to look over her shoulder. Hexenhammer, it said, in a fine, handwritten script.</p><p>\u201cWitches\u2019 Hammer?\u201d I asked. I raised one eyebrow. \u201cSpells? Magic?\u201d</p><p>The skepticism in my voice must have been obvious, for she glared at me over one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLook, fool,\u201d she said. \u201cWho are ye? Or what, rather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I?\u201d I said, startled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She turned and leaned against the counter, studying me through narrowed eyes. \u201cWhat are ye? Or me, come to that? What are we?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply, then closed it again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said softly, watching. \u201cIt\u2019s not everyone can go through the stones, is it? Why us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd neither do you, I\u2019ll be bound. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re witches, surely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it?\u201d She lifted one brow, and turned several pages of the book.</p><p>\u201cSome people can leave their bodies and travel miles away,\u201d she said, staring meditatively at the page. \u201cOther people see them out wandering, and recognize them, and ye can bloody prove they were really tucked up safe in bed at the time. I\u2019ve seen the records, all the eyewitness testimony. Some people have stigmata ye can see and touch\u2014I\u2019ve seen one. But not everybody. Only certain people.\u201d</p><p>She turned another page. \u201cIf everyone can do it, it\u2019s science. If only a few can, then it\u2019s witchcraft, or superstition, or whatever you like to call it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s real.\u201d She looked up at me, green eyes bright as a snake\u2019s over the crumbling book. \u201cWe\u2019re real, Claire\u2014you and me. And special. Have ye never asked yourself why?\u201d</p><p>I had. Any number of times. I had never gotten a reasonable answer to the question, though. Evidently, Geilie thought she had one.</p><p>She turned back to the stones she had laid on the counter, and pointed at them each in turn. \u201cStones of protection; amethyst, emerald, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and a male ruby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA male ruby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPliny says rubies have a sex to them; who am I to argue?\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cThe male stones are what ye use, though; the female ones don\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed the urge to ask precisely how one distinguished the sex of rubies, in favor of asking, \u201cWork for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the travel,\u201d she said, glancing curiously at me. \u201cThrough the stones. They protect ye from the...whatever it is, out there.\u201d Her eyes grew slightly shadowed at the thought of the time-passage, and I realized that she was deathly afraid of it. Little wonder; so was I.</p><p>\u201cWhen did ye come? The first time?\u201d Her eyes were intent on mine.</p><p>\u201cFrom 1945,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI came to 1743, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d I was reluctant to tell her too much; still, my own curiosity was overwhelming. She was right about one thing; she and I were different. I might never again have the chance to talk to another person who knew what she did. For that matter, the longer I could keep her talking, the longer Jamie would have to look for Ian.</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d She grunted in a satisfied manner. \u201cNear enough. It\u2019s two hundred year, in the Highland tales\u2014when folk fall asleep on fairy duns and end up dancing all night wi\u2019 the Auld Folk; it\u2019s usually two hundred year later when they come back to their own place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, though. You came from 1968, but you\u2019d been in Cranesmuir several years before I came there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years, aye.\u201d She nodded, abstracted. \u201cAye, well, that was the blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sacrifice,\u201d she said, suddenly impatient. \u201cIt gives ye a greater range. And at least a bit of control, so ye have some notion how far ye\u2019re going. How did ye get to and fro three times, without blood?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI...just came.\u201d The need to find out as much as I could made me add the little else I knew. \u201cI think\u2014I think it has something to do with being able to fix your mind on a certain person who\u2019s in the time you go to.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were nearly round with interest.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThink o\u2019 that, now.\u201d She shook her head slowly, thinking. \u201cHm. That might be so. Still, the stones should work as well; there\u2019s patterns ye make, wi\u2019 the different gems, ye ken.\u201d</p><p>She pulled another fistful of shining stones from her pocket and spread them on the wooden surface, pawing through them.</p><p>\u201cThe protection stones are the points of the pentacle,\u201d she explained, intent on her rummaging, \u201cbut inside that, ye lay the pattern wi\u2019 different stones, depending which way ye mean to go, and how far. And ye lay a line of quicksilver between them, and fire it when ye speak the spells. And of course ye draw the pentacle wi\u2019 diamond dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I murmured, fascinated.</p><p>\u201cSmell it?\u201d she asked, looking up for a moment and sniffing. \u201cYe wouldna think stones had a scent, aye? But they do, when ye grind them to powder.\u201d</p><p>I inhaled deeply, and did seem to find a faint, unfamiliar scent among the smell of dried herbs. It was a dry scent, pleasant but indescribable\u2014the scent of gemstones.</p><p>She held up one stone with a small cry of triumph.</p><p>\u201cThis one! This is the one I needed; couldna find one anywhere in the islands, and finally I thought o\u2019 the box I\u2019d left in Scotland.\u201d The stone she held was a black crystal of some kind; the light from the window passed through it, and yet it glittered like a piece of jet between her white fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn adamant; a black diamond. The auld alchemists used them. The books say that to wear an adamant brings ye the knowledge of the joy in all things.\u201d She laughed, a short, sharp sound, devoid of her usual girlish charm. \u201cIf anything can bring knowledge o\u2019 joy in that passage through the stones, I want one!\u201d</p><p>Something was beginning to dawn on me, rather belatedly. In defense of my slowness, I can only argue that I was simultaneously listening to Geilie and keeping an ear out for any sign of Jamie returning below.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to go back, then?\u201d I asked, as casually as I could.</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d A small smile played around the corners of her mouth. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got the things I need. I tell ye, Claire, I wouldna risk it, without.\u201d She stared at me, shaking her head. \u201cThree times, wi\u2019 no blood,\u201d she murmured. \u201cSo it can be done.</p><p>\u201cWell, best we go down now,\u201d she said, suddenly brisk, sweeping the stones up and dumping them back into her pocket. \u201cThe fox will be back\u2014Fraser is his name, is it no? I thought Clotilda said something else, but the stupid bitch likely got it wrong.\u201d</p><p>As we made our way down the long workroom, something small and brown darted across the floor in front of me. Geilie was quick, despite her size; her small foot stamped on the centipede before I could react.</p><p>She watched the half-crushed beast wriggling on the floor for a moment, then stooped and slid a sheet of paper under it. Scooping it up, she decanted the thing thriftily into a glass jar.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna want to believe in witches and zombies and things that go bump in the night?\u201d she said, with a small, sly smile at me. She nodded at the centipede, struggling round and round in frenzied, lopsided circles. \u201cWell, legends are many-legged beasties, aye? But they generally have at least one foot on the truth.\u201d</p><p>She took down a clear brown-glass jug and poured the liquid into the centipede\u2019s bottle. The pungent scent of alcohol rose in the air. The centipede, washed up by the wave, kicked frantically for a moment, then sank to the bottom of the bottle, legs moving spasmodically. She corked the bottle neatly, and turned to go.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me why I thought we can pass through the stones,\u201d I said to her back. \u201cDo you know why, Geilie?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy, to change things,\u201d she said, sounding surprised. \u201cWhy else? Come along; I hear your man down there.\u201d</p><p>Whatever Jamie had been doing, it had been hard work; his shirt was dampened with sweat, and clung to his shoulders. He swung around as we entered the room, and I saw that he had been looking at the wooden puzzle-box that Geilie had left on the table. It was obvious from his expression that I had been correct in my surmise\u2014it was the box he had found on the silkies\u2019 isle.</p><p>\u201cI believe I have succeeded in mending your sugar press, mistress,\u201d he said, bowing politely to Geilie. \u201cA matter of a cracked cylinder, which your overseer and I contrived to stuff with wedges. Still, I fear ye may be needing another soon.\u201d</p><p>Geilie quirked her eyebrows, amused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, and I\u2019m obliged to ye, Mr. Fraser. Can I not offer ye some refreshment after your labor?\u201d Her hand hovered over the row of bells, but Jamie shook his head, picking up his coat from the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, mistress, but I fear we must take our leave. It\u2019s quite some way back to Kingston, and we must be on our way, if we mean to reach it before dark.\u201d His face went suddenly blank, and I knew he must have felt the pocket of his coat and realized that the photographs were missing.</p><p>He glanced quickly at me, and I gave him a brief nod, touching the side of my skirt where they lay.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your hospitality,\u201d I said, snatching up my hat, and moving toward the door with alacrity. Now that Jamie was back, I wanted nothing so much as to get quickly away from Rose Hall and its owner. Jamie hung back a moment, though.</p> <p>\u201cI wondered, Mistress Abernathy\u2014since ye mentioned having lived in Paris for a time\u2014whether ye might have been acquainted there wi\u2019 a gentleman of my own acquaintance. Did ye by chance ken the Duke of Sandringham?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her cream-blond head at him inquisitively, but as he said no more, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, I kent him. Why?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave her his most charming smile. \u201cNo particular reason, mistress; only a curiosity, ye might say.\u201d</p><p>The sky was completely overcast by the time we passed the gate, and it was clear that we weren\u2019t going to make it back to Kingston without getting soaked. Under the circumstances, I didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cYe\u2019ve got Brianna\u2019s pictures?\u201d was the first thing Jamie asked, reining up for a moment.</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d I patted my pocket. \u201cDid you find any sign of Ian?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back over his shoulder, as though fearing we might be pursued.</p><p>\u201cI couldna get anything out of the overseer or any o\u2019 the slaves\u2014they\u2019re bone-scairt of that woman, and I canna say I blame them a bit. But I know where he is.\u201d He spoke with considerable satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Can we sneak back and get him?\u201d I rose slightly in my saddle, looking back; the slates of Rose Hall were all that was visible through the treetops. I would have been most reluctant to set foot on the place again for any reason\u2014except for Ian.</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d Jamie caught at my bridle, turning the horse\u2019s head back to the trail. \u201cI\u2019ll need help.\u201d</p> <p>Under the pretext of finding material to repair the damaged sugar press, Jamie had managed to see most of the plantation within a quarter-mile of the house, including a cluster of slave huts, the stables, a disused drying shed for tobacco, and the building that housed the sugar refinery. Everyplace he went, he suffered no interference beyond curious or hostile glances\u2014except near the refinery.</p><p>\u201cThat big black bugger who came up onto the porch was sitting on the ground outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got too close to him, it made the overseer verra nervous indeed; he kept calling me away, warning me not to get too close to the fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a really excellent idea,\u201d I said, shuddering slightly. \u201cNot getting close to him, I mean. But you think he has something to do with Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was sitting in front of a wee door fixed into the ground, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie guided his horse adroitly around a fallen log in the path. \u201cIt must lead to a cellar beneath the refinery.\u201d The man had not moved an inch, in all the time that Jamie contrived to spend around the refinery. \u201cIf Ian\u2019s there, that\u2019s where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly sure he\u2019s there, all right.\u201d I told him quickly the details of my visit, including my brief conversation with the kitchenmaids. \u201cBut what are we going to do?\u201d I concluded. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him there! After all, we don\u2019t know what Geillis wants with him, but it can\u2019t be innocent, if she wouldn\u2019t admit he was there, can it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot innocent at all,\u201d he agreed, grim-faced. \u201cThe overseer wouldna speak to me of Ian, but he told me other things that would curl your hair, if it wasna already curled up like sheep\u2019s wool.\u201d He glanced at me, and a half-smile lit his face, in spite of his obvious perturbation.</p><p>\u201cJudging by the state of your hair, Sassenach, I should say that it\u2019s going to rain verra soon now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow observant of you,\u201d I said sarcastically, vainly trying to tuck in the curls and tendrils that were escaping from under my hat. \u201cThe fact that the sky\u2019s black as pitch and the air smells like lightning wouldn\u2019t have a thing to do with your conclusions, of course.\u201d</p> <p>The leaves of the trees all round us were fluttering like tethered butterflies, as the edge of the storm rose toward us up the slope of the mountain. From the small rise where we stood, I could see the storm clouds sweep in across the bay below, with a dark curtain of rain hanging beneath it like a veil.</p><p>Jamie rose in his saddle, looking over the terrain. To my unpracticed eye, our surroundings looked like solid, impenetrable jungle, but other possibilities were visible to a man who had lived in the heather for seven years.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best find a bit of shelter while we can, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>On foot, leading the horses, we left the narrow path and pressed into the forest, following what Jamie said was a wild pigs\u2019 trail. Within a few moments, he had found what he was looking for; a small stream that cut deep through the forest floor, with a steep bank, overgrown with ferns and dark, glossy bushes, interspersed with stands of slender saplings.</p><p>He set me to gathering ferns, each frond the length of my arm, and by the time I had returned with as many as I could carry, he had the framework of a tidy snug, formed by the arch of the bent saplings, tied to a fallen log, and covered over with branches cut from the nearby bushes. Hastily roofed with the spread ferns, it was not quite waterproof, but a great deal better than being caught in the open. Ten minutes later, we were safe inside.</p><p>There was a moment of absolute quiet as the wind on the edge of the storm passed by us. No birds chattered, no insects sang; they were as well equipped as we were to predict the rain. A few large drops fell, splattering on the foliage with an explosive sound like snapping twigs. Then the storm broke.</p><p>Caribbean rainstorms are abrupt and vigorous. None of the misty mousing about of an Edinburgh drizzle. The heavens blacken and split, dropping gallons of water within a minute. For as long as the rain lasts, speech is impossible, and a light fog rises from the ground like steam, vapor raised by the force of the raindrops striking the ground.</p><p>The rain pelted the ferns above us, and a faint mist filled the green shadows of our shelter. Between the clatter of the rain and the constant thunder that boomed among the hills, it was impossible to talk.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t cold, but there was a leak overhead, which dripped steadily on my neck. There was no room to move away; Jamie took off his coat and wrapped it around me, then put his arm around me to wait out the storm. In spite of the terrible racket outside, I felt suddenly safe, and peaceful, relieved of the strain of the last few hours, the last few days. Ian was as good as found, and nothing could touch us, here.</p><p>I squeezed his free hand; he smiled at me, then bent and kissed me gently. He smelled fresh and earthy, scented with the sap of the branches he had cut and the smell of his own healthy sweat.</p><p>It was nearly over, I thought. We had found Ian, and God willing, would get him back safely, very soon. And then what? We would have to leave Jamaica, but there were other places, and the world was wide. There were the French colonies of Martinique and Grenada, the Dutch-held island of Eleuthera; perhaps we would even venture as far as the continent\u2014cannibals notwithstanding. So long as I had Jamie, I was not afraid of anything.</p><p>The rain ceased as abruptly as it had started. Drops fell singly from the shrubs and trees, with a pit-a-pat drip that echoed the ringing left in my ears by the storm\u2019s roar. A soft, fresh breeze came up the stream bed, carrying away humidity, lifting the damp curls from my neck with delicious coolness. The birds and the insects began again, quietly, and then in full voice, and the air itself seemed to dance with green life.</p><p>I stirred and sighed, pushing myself upright and shrugging off Jamie\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Geilie showed me a special stone, a black diamond called an adamant,\u201d I said. \u201cShe said it\u2019s a stone the alchemists used; it gives a knowledge of the joy in all things. I think there might be one under this spot.\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cI shouldna be surprised at all, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, ye\u2019ve water all down your face.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his coat for a handkerchief, then stopped.</p><p>\u201cBrianna\u2019s pictures,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot.\u201d I dug in my pocket, and handed him back the pictures. He took them and thumbed rapidly through them, stopped, then went through them again, more slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, suddenly alarmed.</p><p>\u201cOne of them\u2019s gone,\u201d he said quietly. I felt an inexpressible feeling of dread begin to grow in the pit of my stomach, and the joy of a moment before began to ebb away.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know them as well as I know your face, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cAye, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s the one of her by the fire.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the picture in question well; it showed Brianna as an adult, sitting on a rock, outdoors by a campfire. Her knees were drawn up, her elbows resting on them, and she was looking directly into the camera, but with no knowledge of its presence, her face filled with firelit dreams, her hair blown back away from her face.</p><p>\u201cGeilie must have taken it. She found the pictures in your coat while I was in the kitchen, and I took them away from her. She must have stolen it then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn the woman!\u201d Jamie turned sharply to look toward the road, eyes dark with anger. His hand was tight on the remaining photographs. \u201cWhat does she want with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s only curiosity,\u201d I said, but the feeling of dread would not go away. \u201cWhat could she do with it, after all? She isn\u2019t likely to show it to anyone\u2014who would come here?\u201d</p><p>As though in answer to this question, Jamie\u2019s head lifted suddenly, and he grasped my arm in adjuration to be still. Some distance below, a loop of the road was visible through the overgrowth, a thin ribbon of yellowish mud. Along this ribbon came a plodding figure on horseback, a man dressed in black, small and dark as an ant at this distance.</p><p>Then I remembered what Geilie had said. I\u2019m expecting a visitor. And later, That parson said he\u2019d come at four o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a parson, a minister of some kind,\u201d I said. \u201cShe said she was expecting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Archie Campbell, is who it is,\u201d Jamie said, with some grimness. \u201cWhat the devil\u2014or perhaps I shouldna use that particular expression, wi\u2019 respect to Mistress Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he\u2019s come to exorcise her,\u201d I suggested, with a nervous laugh.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s his work cut out for him, if so.\u201d The angular figure disappeared into the trees, but it was several minutes before Jamie deemed him safely past us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do about Ian?\u201d I asked, once we had made our way back to the path.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need help,\u201d he answered briskly. \u201cI mean to come up the river with Innes and MacLeod and the rest. There\u2019s a landing there, no great distance from the refinery. We\u2019ll leave the boat there, go ashore and deal wi\u2019 Hercules\u2014and Atlas, too, if he\u2019s a mind to be troublesome\u2014break open the cellar, snatch Ian, and make off again. The dark o\u2019 the moon\u2019s in two days\u2014I wish it could be sooner, but it will likely take that long to get a suitable boat and what arms we\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing what for money?\u201d I inquired bluntly. The expenditure for new clothes and shoes had taken a substantial portion of Jamie\u2019s share of profit from the bat guano. What was left would feed us for several weeks, and possibly be sufficient to rent a boat for a day or two, but it wouldn\u2019t stretch to buying large quantities of weapons.</p><p>Neither pistols nor swords were manufactured on the island; all weapons were imported from Europe and were in consequence expensive. Jamie himself had Captain Raines\u2019s two pistols; the Scots had nothing but their fish knives and the odd cutlass\u2014insufficient for an armed raid.</p> <p>He grimaced slightly, then glanced at me sidelong.</p><p>\u201cI must ask John for help,\u201d he said simply. \u201cMust I not?\u201d</p><p>I rode silently for a moment, then nodded in acquiescence.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll have to.\u201d I didn\u2019t like it, but it wasn\u2019t a question of my liking; it was Ian\u2019s life. \u201cOne thing, though, Jamie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cYe mean to come with me, no?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cAfter all, what if Ian\u2019s hurt, or sick, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye can come!\u201d he said, rather testily. \u201cOnly do me the one wee favor, Sassenach. Try verra hard not to be killed or cut to pieces, aye? It\u2019s hard on a man\u2019s sensibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I said, circumspectly. And nudging my horse closer to his, rode side by side down toward Kingston, through the dripping trees.</p><p>61</p><p>THE CROCODILE\u2019S FIRE</p><p>There was a surprising amount of traffic on the river at night. Lawrence Stern, who had insisted on accompanying the expedition, told me that most of the plantations up in the hills used the river as their main linkage with Kingston and the harbor; roads were either atrocious or nonexistent, swallowed by lush growth with each new rainy season.</p> <p>I had expected the river to be deserted, but we passed two small craft and a barge headed downstream as we tacked laboriously up the broad waterway, under sail. The barge, an immense dark shape stacked high with casks and bales, passed us like a black iceberg, huge, humped, and threatening. The low voices of the slaves poling it carried across the water, talking softly in a foreign tongue.</p><p>\u201cIt was kind of ye to come, Lawrence,\u201d Jamie said. We had a small, single-masted open boat, which barely held Jamie, myself, the six Scottish smugglers, and Stern. Despite the crowded quarters, I too was grateful for Stern\u2019s company; he had a stolid, phlegmatic quality about him that was very comforting under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cWell, I confess to some curiosity,\u201d Stern said, flapping the front of his shirt to cool his sweating body. In the dark, all I could see of him was a moving blotch of white. \u201cI have met the lady before, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Abernathy?\u201d I paused, then asked delicately, \u201cEr...what did you think of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...she was a very pleasant lady; most...gracious.\u201d</p><p>Dark as it was, I couldn\u2019t see his face, but his voice held an odd note, half-pleased, half-embarrassed, that told me he had found the widow Abernathy quite attractive indeed. From which I concluded that Geilie had wanted something from the naturalist; I had never known her treat a man with any regard, save for her own ends.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you meet her? At her own house?\u201d According to the attendees at the Governor\u2019s ball, Mrs. Abernathy seldom or never left her plantation.</p><p>\u201cYes, at Rose Hall. I had stopped to ask permission to collect a rare type of beetle\u2014one of the Cucurlionidae\u2014that I had found near a spring on the plantation. She invited me in, and...made me most welcome.\u201d This time there was a definite note of self-satisfaction in his voice. Jamie, handling the tiller next to me, heard it and snorted briefly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did she want of ye?\u201d he asked, no doubt having formed conclusions similar to mine about Geilie\u2019s motives and behavior.</p><p>\u201cOh, she was most gratifyingly interested in the specimens of flora and fauna I had collected on the island; she asked me about the locations and virtues of several different herbs. Ah, and about the other places I had been. She was particularly interested in my stories of Hispaniola.\u201d He sighed, momentarily regretful. \u201cIt is difficult to believe that such a lovely woman might engage in such reprehensible behavior as you describe, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely, aye?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was dryly amused. \u201cA bit smitten, were ye, Lawrence?\u201d</p><p>Lawrence\u2019s voice echoed Jamie\u2019s smile. \u201cThere is a sort of carnivorous fly I have observed, friend James. The male fly, choosing a female to court, takes pains to bring her a bit of meat or other prey, tidily wrapped in a small silk package. While the female is engaged in unwrapping her tidbit, he leaps upon her, performs his copulatory duties, and hastens away. For if she should finish her meal before he has finished his own activities, or should he be so careless as not to bring her a tasty present\u2014she eats him.\u201d There was a soft laugh in the darkness. \u201cNo, it was an interesting experience, but I think I shall not call upon Mrs. Abernathy again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if we\u2019re lucky about it, no,\u201d Jamie agreed.</p><p>The men left me by the riverbank to mind the boat, and melted into the darkness, with instructions from Jamie to stay put. I had a primed pistol, given to me with the stern injunction not to shoot myself in the foot. The weight of it was comforting, but as the minutes dragged by in black silence, I found the dark and the solitude more and more oppressive.</p><p>From where I stood, I could see the house, a dark oblong with only the lower three windows lighted; that would be the salon, I thought, and wondered why there was no sign of any activity by the slaves. As I watched, though, I saw a shadow cross one of the lighted windows, and my heart jumped into my throat.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Geilie\u2019s shadow, by any conceivable stretch of the imagination. It was tall, thin, and gawkily angular.</p><p>I looked wildly around, wanting to call out; but it was too late. The men were all out of earshot, headed for the refinery. I hesitated for a moment, but there was really nothing else to do. I kilted up my skirts and stepped into the dark.</p><p>By the time I stepped onto the veranda, I was damp with perspiration, and my heart was beating loudly enough to drown out all other sounds. I edged silently next to the nearest window, trying to peer in without being seen from within.</p><p>Everything was quiet and orderly within. There was a small fire on the hearth, and the glow of the flames gleamed on the polished floor. Geilie\u2019s rosewood secretary was unfolded, the desk shelf covered with piles of handwritten papers and what looked like very old books. I couldn\u2019t see anyone inside, but I couldn\u2019t see the whole room, either.</p><p>My skin prickled with imagination, thinking of the dead-eyed Hercules, silently stalking me in the dark. I edged farther down the veranda, looking over my shoulder with every other step.</p><p>There was an odd sense of desertion about the place this evening. There were none of the subdued voices of slaves that had attended my earlier visit, muttering to one another as they went about their tasks. But that might mean nothing, I told myself. Most of the slaves would stop work and go to their own quarters at sundown. Still, ought there not to be house servants, to tend the fire and fetch food from the kitchen?</p><p>The front door stood open. Spilled petals from the yellow rose lay across the doorstep, glowing like ancient gold coins in the faint light from the entryway.</p><p>I paused, listening. I thought I heard a faint rustle from inside the salon, as of someone turning the pages of a book, but I couldn\u2019t be sure. Taking my courage in both hands, I stepped across the threshold.</p><p>The feeling of desertion was more pronounced in here. There were unmistakable signs of neglect visible; a vase of wilted flowers on the polished surface of a chest, a teacup and saucer left to sit on an occasional table, the dregs dried to a brown stain in the bottom of the cup. Where the hell was everybody?</p><p>I stopped at the door into the salon and listened again. I heard the quiet crackle of the fire, and again, that soft rustle, as of turning pages. By poking my head around the jamb, I could just see that there was someone seated in front of the secretary now. Someone undeniably male, tall and thin-shouldered, dark head bent over something before him.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d I hissed, as loudly as I dared. \u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>The figure started, pushed back the chair, and stood up quickly, blinking toward the shadows.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Malcolm?\u201d said the Reverend Archibald Campbell, astonished.</p><p>I swallowed, trying to force my heart down out of my throat. The Reverend looked nearly as startled as I, but it lasted only a moment. Then his features hardened, and he took a step toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my husband\u2019s nephew,\u201d I said; there was no point in lying, and perhaps he knew where Ian was. I glanced quickly round the room, but it was empty, save for the Reverend, and the one small lighted lamp he had been using. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mrs. Abernathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cShe appears to have left. What do you mean, your husband\u2019s nephew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft?\u201d I blinked at him. \u201cWhere has she gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He scowled, his pointed upper lip clamped beaklike over the lower one. \u201cShe was gone when I rose this morning\u2014and all of the servants with her, apparently. A fine way to treat an invited guest!\u201d</p><p>I relaxed slightly, despite my alarm. At least I was in no danger of running into Geilie. I thought I could deal with the Reverend Campbell.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, that does seem a bit inhospitable, I admit. I suppose you haven\u2019t seen a boy of about fifteen, very tall and thin, with thick dark brown hair? No, I didn\u2019t think you had. In that case, I expect I should be go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d He grabbed me by the upper arm, and I stopped, surprised and unsettled by the strength of his grip.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your husband\u2019s true name?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014Alexander Malcolm,\u201d I said, tugging at my captive arm. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. And how is it, then, that when I described you and your husband to Mrs. Abernathy, she told me that your family name is Fraser\u2014that your husband in fact is James Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I took a deep breath, trying to think of something plausible, but failed. I never had been good at lying on short notice.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your husband, woman?\u201d he demanded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, trying to extract myself from his grasp, \u201cyou\u2019re quite wrong about Jamie. He had nothing to do with your sister, he told me. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to him about Margaret?\u201d His grip tightened. I gave a small grunt of discomfort and yanked a bit harder.</p><p>\u201cYes. He says that it wasn\u2019t him\u2014he wasn\u2019t the man she went to Culloden to see. It was a friend of his, Ewan Cameron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re lying,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cOr he is. It makes little difference. Where is he?\u201d He gave me a small shake, and I jerked hard, managing to detach my arm from his grip.</p> <p>\u201cI tell you, he had nothing to do with what happened to your sister!\u201d I was backing away, wondering how to get away from him without setting him loose to blunder about the grounds in search of Jamie, making noise and drawing unwelcome attention to the rescue effort. Eight men were enough to overcome the pillars of Hercules, but not enough to withstand a hundred roused slaves.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d The Reverend was advancing on me, eyes boring into mine.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Kingston!\u201d I said. I glanced to one side; I was near a pair of French doors opening onto the veranda. I thought I could get out without his catching me, but then what? Having him chase me through the grounds would be worse than keeping him talking in here.</p><p>I looked back at the Reverend, who was scowling at me in disbelief, and then what I had seen on the terrace registered in my mind\u2019s eye, and I jerked my head back around, staring.</p><p>I had seen it. There was a large white pelican perched on the veranda railing, head turned back, beak buried comfortably in its feathers. Ping An\u2019s plumage glinted silver against the night in the dim light from the doorway.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Reverend Campbell demanded. \u201cWho is it? Who\u2019s out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a bird,\u201d I said, turning back to him. My heart was beating in a jerky rhythm. Mr. Willoughby must surely be nearby. Pelicans were common, near the mouths of rivers, near the shore, but I had never seen one so far inland. But if Mr. Willoughby was in fact lurking nearby, what ought I to do about it?</p><p>\u201cI doubt very much that your husband is in Kingston,\u201d the Reverend was saying, narrowed eyes fixed on me with suspicion. \u201cHowever, if he is, he will presumably be coming here, to retrieve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated, with as much assurance as I could manage. \u201cJamie isn\u2019t coming here. I came by myself, to visit Geillis\u2014Mrs. Abernathy. My husband isn\u2019t expecting me back until next month.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe me, but there was nothing he could do about it, either. His mouth pursed up in a tiny rosette, then unpuckered enough to ask, \u201cSo you are staying here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, pleased that I knew enough about the geography of the place to pretend to be a guest. If the servants were gone, there was no one to say I wasn\u2019t, after all.</p><p>He stood still, regarding me narrowly for a long moment. Then his jaw tightened and he nodded grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Then I suppose ye\u2019ll have some notion as to where our hostess has taken herself, and when she proposes to return?\u201d</p><p>I was beginning to have a rather unsettling notion of where\u2014if not exactly when\u2014Geillis Abernathy might have gone, but the Reverend Campbell didn\u2019t seem the proper person with whom to share it.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not,\u201d I said. \u201cI...ah, I\u2019ve been out visiting since yesterday, at the neighboring plantation. Just came back this minute.\u201d</p><p>The Reverend eyed me closely, but I was in fact wearing a riding habit\u2014because it was the only decent set of clothes I owned, besides the violet ball dress and two wash-muslin gowns\u2014and my story passed unchallenged.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said. \u201cMmphm. Well, then.\u201d He fidgeted restlessly, his big bony hands clenching and unclenching themselves, as though he were not certain what to do with them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me disturb you,\u201d I said, with a charming smile and a nod at the desk. \u201cI\u2019m sure you must have important work to do.\u201d</p> <p>He pursed his lips again, in that objectionable way that made him look like an owl contemplating a juicy mouse. \u201cThe work has been completed. I was only preparing copies of some documents that Mrs. Abernathy had requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d I said automatically, thinking that with luck, after a few moments\u2019 small talk, I could escape under the pretext of retiring to my theoretical room\u2014all the first-floor rooms opened onto the veranda, and it would be a simple matter to slip off into the night to meet Jamie.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you share our hostess\u2019s\u2014and my own\u2014interest in Scottish history and scholarship?\u201d His gaze had sharpened, and with a sinking heart I recognized the fanatical gleam of the passionate researcher in his eyes. I knew it well.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very interesting, I\u2019m sure,\u201d I said, edging toward the door, \u201cbut I must say, I really don\u2019t know very much about\u2014\u201d I caught sight of the top sheet on his pile of documents, and stopped dead.</p><p>It was a genealogy chart. I had seen plenty of those, living with Frank, but I recognized this particular one. It was a chart of the Fraser family\u2014the bloody thing was even headed \u201cFraser of Lovat\u201d\u2014beginning somewhere around the 1400s, so far as I could see, and running down to the present. I could see Simon, the late\u2014and not so lamented, in some quarters\u2014Jacobite lord, who had been executed for his part in Charles Stuart\u2019s Rising, and his descendants, whose names I recognized. And down in one corner, with the sort of notation indicating illegitimacy, was Brian Fraser\u2014Jamie\u2019s father. And beneath him, written in a precise black hand, James A. Fraser.</p><p>I felt a chill ripple up my back. The Reverend had noticed my reaction, and was watching with a sort of dry amusement.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is interesting that it should be the Frasers, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...what should be the Frasers?\u201d I said. Despite myself, I moved slowly toward the desk.</p><p>\u201cThe subject of the prophecy, of course,\u201d he said, looking faintly surprised. \u201cDo ye not know of it? But perhaps, your husband being an illegitimate descendant...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know of it, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The Reverend was beginning to enjoy himself, seizing the opportunity to inform me. \u201cI thought perhaps Mrs. Abernathy had spoken of it to you; she being so interested as to have written to me in Edinburgh regarding the matter.\u201d He thumbed through the stack, extracting one paper that appeared to be written in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cThis is the original language of the prophecy,\u201d he said, shoving Exhibit A under my nose. \u201cBy the Brahan Seer; you\u2019ll have heard of the Brahan Seer, surely?\u201d His tone held out little hope, but in fact, I had heard of the Brahan Seer, a sixteenth-century prophet along the lines of a Scottish Nostradamus.</p><p>\u201cI have. It\u2019s a prophecy concerning the Frasers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Frasers of Lovat, aye. The language is poetic, as I pointed out to Mistress Abernathy, but the meaning is clear enough.\u201d He was gathering enthusiasm as he went along, notwithstanding his suspicions of me. \u201cThe prophecy states that a new ruler of Scotland will spring from Lovat\u2019s lineage. This is to come to pass following the eclipse of \u2018the kings of the white rose\u2019\u2014a clear reference to the Papist Stuarts, of course.\u201d He nodded at the white roses woven into the carpet. \u201cThere are somewhat more cryptic references included in the prophecy, of course; the time in which this ruler will appear, and whether it is to be a king or a queen\u2014there is some difficulty in interpretation, owing to mishandling of the original...\u201d</p><p>He went on, but I wasn\u2019t listening. If I had had any doubt about where Geilie had gone, it was fast disappearing. Obsessed with the rulers of Scotland, she had spent the better part of ten years in working for the restoration of a Stuart Throne. That attempt had failed most definitively at Culloden, and she had then expressed nothing but contempt for all extant Stuarts. And little wonder, if she thought she knew what was coming next.</p><p>But where would she go? Back to Scotland, perhaps, to involve herself with Lovat\u2019s heir? No, she was thinking of making the leap through time again; that much was clear from her conversation with me. She was preparing herself, gathering her resources\u2014retrieving the treasure from the silkies\u2019 isle\u2014and completing her researches.</p><p>I stared at the paper in a kind of fascinated horror. The genealogy, of course, was only recorded to the present. Did Geilie know who Lovat\u2019s descendants would be, in the future?</p><p>I looked up to ask the Reverend Campbell a question, but the words froze on my lips. Standing in the door to the veranda was Mr. Willoughby.</p><p>The little Chinese had evidently been having a rough time; his silk pajamas were torn and stained, and his round face was beginning to show the hollows of hunger and fatigue. His eyes passed over me with only a remote flicker of acknowledgment; all his attention was for the Reverend Campbell.</p><p>\u201cMost holy fella,\u201d he said, and his voice held a tone I had never heard in him before; an ugly taunting note.</p><p>The Reverend whirled, so quickly that his elbow knocked against a vase; water and yellow roses cascaded over the rosewood desk, soaking the papers. The Reverend gave a cry of rage, and snatched the papers from the flood, shaking them frantically to remove the water before the ink should run.</p><p>\u201cSee what ye\u2019ve done, ye wicked, murdering heathen!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Willoughby laughed. Not his usual high giggle, but a low chuckle. It didn\u2019t sound at all amused.</p><p>\u201cI murdering?\u201d He shook his head slowly back and forth, eyes fixed on the Reverend. \u201cNot me, holy fella. Is you, murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegone, fellow,\u201d Campbell said coldly. \u201cYou should know better than to enter a lady\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d The Chinaman\u2019s voice was low and even, his gaze unwavering. \u201cI see you. See you in red room, with the woman who laughs. See you too with stinking whores, in Scotland.\u201d Very slowly, he lifted his hand to his throat and drew it across, precise as a blade. \u201cYou kill pretty often, holy fella, I think.\u201d</p><p>The Reverend Campbell had gone pale, whether from shock or rage, I couldn\u2019t tell. I was pale, too\u2014from fear. I wet my dry lips and forced myself to speak.</p><p>\u201cMr. Willoughby\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Willoughby.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at me; the correction was almost indifferent. \u201cI am Yi Tien Cho.\u201d</p><p>Seeking escape from the present situation, my mind wondered absurdly whether the proper form of address would be Mr. Yi, or Mr. Cho?</p><p>\u201cGet out at once!\u201d The Reverend\u2019s paleness came from rage. He advanced on the little Chinese, massive fists clenched. Mr. Willoughby didn\u2019t move, seemingly indifferent to the looming minister.</p><p>\u201cBetter you leave, First Wife,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cHoly fella liking women\u2014not with cock. With knife.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t wearing a corset, but felt as though I were. I couldn\u2019t get enough breath to form words.</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d the Reverend said sharply. \u201cI tell you again\u2014get out! Or I shall\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust stand still, please, Reverend Campbell,\u201d I said. Hands shaking, I drew the pistol Jamie had given me out of the pocket of my habit and pointed it at him. Rather to my surprise, he did stand still, staring at me as though I had just grown two heads.</p><p>I had never held anyone at gunpoint before; the sensation was quite oddly intoxicating, in spite of the way the pistol\u2019s barrel wavered. At the same time, I had no real idea what to do.</p><p>\u201cMr.\u2014\u201d I gave up, and used all his names. \u201cYi Tien Cho. Did you see the Reverend at the Governor\u2019s ball with Mrs. Alcott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see him kill her,\u201d Yi Tien Cho said flatly. \u201cBetter shoot, First Wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! My dear Mrs. Fraser, surely you cannot believe the word of a savage, who is himself\u2014\u201d The Reverend turned toward me, trying for a superior expression, which was rather impaired by the small beads of sweat that had formed at the edge of his receding hairline.</p><p>\u201cBut I think I do,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were there. I saw you. And you were in Edinburgh when the last prostitute was killed there. Nellie Cowden said you\u2019d lived in Edinburgh for two years; that\u2019s how long the Fiend was killing girls there.\u201d The trigger was slippery under my forefinger.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how long he had lived there, too!\u201d The Reverend\u2019s face was losing its paleness, becoming more flushed by the moment. He jerked his head toward the Chinese.</p><p>\u201cWill you take the word of the man who betrayed your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHim!\u201d The Reverend\u2019s exasperation roughened his voice. \u201cIt is this wicked creature who betrayed Fraser to Sir Percival Turner. Sir Percival told me!\u201d</p><p>I nearly dropped the gun. Things were happening a lot too fast for me. I hoped desperately that Jamie and his men had found Ian and returned to the river\u2014surely they would come to the house, if I was not at the rendezvous.</p><p>I lifted the pistol a little, meaning to tell the Reverend to go down the breezeway to the kitchen; locking him in one of the storage pantries was the best thing I could think of to do.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better\u2014\u201d I began, and then he lunged at me.</p><p>My finger squeezed the trigger in reflex. Simultaneously, there was a loud report, the weapon kicked in my hand, and a small cloud of black-powder smoke rolled past my face, making my eyes water.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t hit him. The explosion had startled him, but now his face settled into new lines of satisfaction. Without speaking, he reached into his coat and drew out a chased-metal case, six inches long. From one end of this protruded a handle of white staghorn.</p> <p>With the horrible clarity that attends crisis of all kinds, I noted everything, from the nick in the edge of the blade as he drew it from the case, to the scent of the rose he crushed beneath one foot as he came toward me.</p><p>There was nowhere to run. I braced myself to fight, knowing fight was useless. The fresh scar of the cutlass slash burned on my arm, a reminder of what was coming that made my flesh shrink. There was a flash of blue in the corner of my vision, and a juicy thunk! as though someone had dropped a melon from some height. The Reverend turned very slowly on one shoe, eyes wide open and quite, quite blank. For that one moment, he looked like Margaret. Then he fell.</p><p>He fell all of a piece, not putting out a hand to save himself. One of the satinwood tables went flying, scattering potpourri and polished stones. The Reverend\u2019s head hit the floor at my feet, bounced slightly and lay still. I took one convulsive step back and stood trapped, back against the wall.</p><p>There was a dreadful contused depression in his temple. As I watched, his face changed color, fading before my eyes from the red of choler to a pasty white. His chest rose, fell, paused, rose again. His eyes were open; so was his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTsei-mi is here, First Wife?\u201d The Chinese was putting the bag that held the stone balls back into his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s here\u2014out there.\u201d I waved vaguely toward the veranda. \u201cWhat\u2014he\u2014did you really\u2014?\u201d I felt the waves of shock creeping over me and fought them back, closing my eyes and drawing in a breath as deep as I could manage.</p><p>\u201cWas it you?\u201d I said, my eyes still closed. If he was going to cave in my head as well, I didn\u2019t want to watch. \u201cDid he tell the truth? Was it you who gave away the meeting place at Arbroath to Sir Percival? Who told him about Malcolm, and the printshop?\u201d</p><p>There was neither answer nor movement, and after a moment, I opened my eyes. He was standing there, watching the Reverend Campbell.</p> <p>Archibald Campbell lay still as death, but was not yet dead. The dark angel was coming, though; his skin had taken on the faint green tinge I had seen before in dying men. Still, his lungs moved, taking air with a high wheezing sound.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an Englishman, then,\u201d I said. My hands were wet, and I wiped them on my skirt. \u201cAn English name. Willoughby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Willoughby,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cI am Yi Tien Cho!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy!\u201d I said, almost shouting. \u201cLook at me, damn you! Why?\u201d</p><p>He did look at me then. His eyes were black and round as marbles, but they had lost their shine.</p><p>\u201cIn China,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are...stories. Prophecy. That one day the ghosts will come. Everyone fear ghost.\u201d He nodded once, twice, then glanced again at the figure on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI leave China to save my life. Waking up long time\u2014I see ghosts. All round me, ghosts,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cA big ghost comes\u2014horrible white face, most horrible, hair on fire. I think he will eat my soul.\u201d His eyes had been fixed on the Reverend; now they rose to my face, remote and still as standing water.</p><p>\u201cI am right,\u201d he said simply, and nodded again. He had not shaved his head recently, but the scalp beneath the black fuzz gleamed in the light from the window.</p><p>\u201cHe eat my soul, Tsei-mi. I am no more, Yi Tien Cho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved your life,\u201d I said. He nodded once more.</p><p>\u201cI know. Better I die. Better die than be Willoughby. Willoughby! Ptah!\u201d He turned his head and spat. His face contorted, suddenly angry.</p><p>\u201cHe talks my words, Tsei-mi! He eats my soul!\u201d The fit of anger seemed to pass as quickly as it had come on. He was sweating, though the room was not terribly warm. He passed a trembling hand over his face, wiping away the moisture.</p><p>\u201cThere is a man I see in tavern. Ask for Mac-Doo. I am drunk,\u201d he said dispassionately. \u201cWanting woman, no woman come with me\u2014laugh, saying yellow worm, point...\u201d He waved a hand vaguely toward the front of his trousers. He shook his head, his queue rustling softly against the silk.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what gwao-fei do; all same to me. I am drunk,\u201d he said again. \u201cGhost-man wants Mac-Doo, ask I am knowing. Say yes, I know MacDoo.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt is not important what I say.\u201d</p><p>He was staring at the minister again. I saw the narrow black chest rise slowly, fall...rise once more, fall...and remain still. There was no sound in the room; the wheezing had stopped.</p><p>\u201cIt is a debt,\u201d Yi Tien Cho said. He nodded toward the still body. \u201cI am dishonored. I am stranger. But I pay. Your life for mine, First Wife. You tell Tsei-mi.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once more, and turned toward the door. There was a faint rustling of feathers from the dark veranda. On the threshold he turned back.</p><p>\u201cWhen I wake on dock, I am thinking ghosts have come, are all around me,\u201d Yi Tien Cho said softly. His eyes were dark and flat, with no depth to them. \u201cBut I am wrong. It is me; I am the ghost.\u201d</p><p>There was a stir of breeze at the French windows, and he was gone. The quick soft sound of felt-shod feet passed down the veranda, followed by the rustle of spread wings, and a soft, plaintive Gwaaa! that faded into the night-sounds of the plantation.</p><p>I made it to the sofa before my knees gave way. I bent down and laid my head on my knees, praying that I would not faint. The blood hammered in my ears. I thought I heard a wheezing breath, and jerked up my head in panic, but the Reverend Campbell lay quite still.</p><p>I could not stay in the same room with him. I got up, circling as far around the body as I could get, but before I reached the veranda door, I had changed my mind. All the events of the evening were colliding in my head like the bits of glass in a kaleidoscope.</p><p>I could not stop now to think, to make sense of it all. But I remembered the Reverend\u2019s words, before Yi Tien Cho had come. If there was any clue here to where Geillis Abernathy had gone, it would be upstairs. I took a candle from the table, lighted it, and made my way through the dark house to the staircase, resisting the urge to look behind me. I felt very cold.</p><p>The workroom was dark, but a faint, eerie violet glow hovered over the far end of the counter. There was an odd burnt smell in the room, that stung the back of my nose and made me sneeze. The faint metallic aftertaste in the back of my throat reminded me of a long-ago chemistry class.</p><p>Quicksilver. Burning mercury. The vapor it gave off was not only eerily beautiful, but highly toxic as well. I snatched out a handkerchief and plastered it over my nose and mouth as I went toward the site of the violet glow.</p><p>The lines of the pentacle had been charred into the wood of the counter. If she had used stones to mark a pattern, she had taken them with her, but she had left something else behind.</p><p>The photograph was heavily singed at the edges, but the center was untouched. My heart gave a thump of shock. I seized the picture, clutching Brianna\u2019s face to my chest with a mingled feeling of fury and panic.</p><p>What did she mean by this\u2014this desecration? It couldn\u2019t have been meant as a gesture toward me or Jamie, for she could not have expected either of us ever to have seen it.</p><p>It must be magic\u2014or Geilie\u2019s version of it. I tried frantically to recall our conversation in this room; what had she said? She had been curious about how I had traveled through the stones\u2014that was the main thing. And what had I said? Only something vague, about fixing my attention on a person\u2014yes, that was it\u2014I said I had fixed my attention on a specific person inhabiting the time to which I was drawn.</p><p>I drew a deep breath, and discovered that I was trembling, both with delayed reaction from the scene in the salon, and from a dreadful, growing apprehension. It might be only that Geilie had decided to try my technique\u2014if one could dignify it with such a word\u2014as well as her own, and use the image of Brianna as a point of fixation for her travel. Or\u2014I thought of the Reverend\u2019s piles of neat, handwritten papers, the carefully drawn genealogies, and thought I might just faint.</p><p>\u201cOne of the Brahan Seer\u2019s prophecies,\u201d he had said. \u201cConcerning the Frasers of Lovat. Scotland\u2019s ruler will come from that lineage.\u201d But thanks to Roger Wakefield\u2019s researches, I knew\u2014what Geilie almost certainly knew as well, obsessed as she was with Scottish history\u2014that Lovat\u2019s direct line had failed in the 1800s. To all visible intents and purposes, that is. There was in fact one survivor of that line living in 1968\u2014Brianna.</p><p>It took a moment for me to realize that the low, growling sound I heard was coming from my own throat, and a moment more of conscious effort to unclench my jaws.</p><p>I stuffed the mutilated photograph into the pocket of my skirt and whirled, running for the door as though the workroom were inhabited by demons. I had to find Jamie\u2014now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were not there. The boat floated silently, empty in the shadows of the big cecropia where we had left it, but of Jamie and the rest, there was no sign at all.</p><p>One of the cane fields lay a short distance to my right, between me and the looming rectangle of the refinery beyond. The faint caramel smell of burnt sugar lingered over the field. Then the wind changed, and I smelled the clean, damp scent of moss and wet rocks from the stream, with all the tiny pungencies of the water plants intermingled.</p><p>The stream bank rose sharply here, going up in a mounded ridge that ended at the edge of the cane field. I scrambled up the slope, my palm slipping in soft sticky mud. I shook it off with a muffled exclamation of disgust and wiped my hand on my skirt. A thrill of anxiety ran through me. Bloody hell, where was Jamie? He should have been back long since.</p><p>Two torches burned by the front gate of Rose Hall, small dots of flickering light at this distance. There was a closer light as well; a glow from the left of the refinery. Had Jamie and his men met trouble there? I could hear a faint singing from that direction, and see a deeper glow that bespoke a large open fire. It seemed peaceful, but something about the night\u2014or the place\u2014made me very uneasy.</p> <p>Suddenly I became aware of another scent, above the tang of watercress and burnt sugar\u2014a strong putrid-sweet smell that I recognized at once as the smell of rotten meat. I took a cautious step, and all hell promptly broke loose underfoot.</p><p>It was as though a piece of the night had suddenly detached itself from the rest and sprung into action at about the level of my knees. A very large object exploded into movement close to me, and there was a stunning blow across my lower legs that knocked me off my feet.</p><p>My involuntary shriek coincided with a truly awful sound\u2014a sort of loud, grunting hiss that confirmed my impression that I was in close juxtaposition to something large, alive, and reeking of carrion. I didn\u2019t know what it was, but I wanted no part of it.</p><p>I had landed very hard on my bottom. I didn\u2019t pause to see what was happening, but flipped over and made off through the mud and leaves on all fours, followed by a repetition of the grunting hiss, only louder, and a scrabbling, sliding sort of rush. Something hit my foot a glancing blow, and I stumbled to my feet, running.</p><p>I was so panicked that I didn\u2019t realize that I suddenly could see, until the man loomed up before me. I crashed into him, and the torch he was carrying dropped to the ground, hissing as it struck the wet leaves.</p> <p>Hands grabbed my shoulders, and there were shouts behind me. My face was pressed against a hairless chest with a strong musky smell about it. I regained my balance, gasping, and leaned back to look into the face of a tall black slave, who was gaping down at me in perplexed dismay.</p><p>\u201cMissus, what you be doin\u2019 here?\u201d he said. Before I could answer, though, his attention was distracted from me to what was going on behind me. His grip on my shoulders relaxed, and I turned to see.</p><p>Six men surrounded the beast. Two carried torches, which they held aloft to light the other four, dressed only in loin cloths, who cautiously circled, holding sharpened wooden poles at the ready.</p><p>My legs were still stinging and wobbly from the blow they had taken; when I saw what had struck me, they nearly gave way again. The thing was nearly twelve feet long, with an armored body the size of a rum cask. The great tail whipped suddenly to one side; the man nearest leapt aside, shouting in alarm, and the saurian\u2019s head turned, jaws opening slightly to emit another hiss.</p><p>The jaws clicked shut with an audible snap, and I saw the telltale carnassial tooth, jutting up from the lower jaw in an expression of grim and spurious pleasantry.</p><p>\u201cNever smile at a crocodile,\u201d I said stupidly.</p> <p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I surely won\u2019t,\u201d the slave said, leaving me and edging cautiously toward the scene of action.</p><p>The men with the poles were poking at the beast, evidently trying to irritate it. In this endeavor, they appeared to be succeeding. The fat, splayed limbs dug hard into the ground, and the crocodile charged, roaring. It lunged with astonishing speed; the man before it yelped and jumped back, lost his footing on the slippery mud and fell.</p><p>The man who had collided with me launched himself through the air and landed on the crocodile\u2019s back. The men with the torches danced back and forth, yelling encouragement, and one of the pole men, bolder than the others, dashed forward and whacked his pole across the broad, plated head to distract it, while the fallen slave scrabbled backward, bare heels scooping trenches in the black mud.</p><p>The man on the crocodile\u2019s back was groping\u2014with what seemed to me suicidal mania\u2014for the beast\u2019s mouth. Getting a hold with one arm about the thick neck, he managed to grab the end of the snout with one hand, and holding the mouth shut, screamed something to his companions.</p><p>Suddenly a figure I hadn\u2019t noticed before stepped out of the shadow of the cane. It went down on one knee before the struggling pair, and without hesitation, slipped a rope noose around the lizard\u2019s jaws. The shouting rose in a yell of triumph, cut off by a sharp word from the kneeling figure.</p><p>He rose and motioned violently, shouting commands. He wasn\u2019t speaking English, but his concern was obvious; the great tail was still free, lashing from side to side with a force that would have felled any man who came within range of it. Seeing the power of that stroke, I could only marvel that my own legs were merely bruised, and not broken.</p><p>The pole men dashed in closer, in response to the commands of their leader. I could feel the half-pleasant numbness of shock stealing over me, and in that state of unreality, it somehow seemed no surprise to see that the leader was the man called Ishmael.</p><p>\u201cHuwe!\u201d he said, making violent upward gestures with his palms that made his meaning obvious. Two of the pole men had gotten their poles shoved under the belly; a third now managed a lucky strike past the tossing head, and lodged his pole under the chest.</p> <p>\u201cHuwe!\u201d Ishmael said again, and all three threw themselves hard upon their poles. With a sucking splat! the reptile flipped over and landed thrashing on its back, its underside a sudden gleaming white in the torchlight.</p><p>The torchbearers were shouting again; the noise rang in my ears. Then Ishmael stopped them with a word, his hand thrown out in demand, palm up. I couldn\u2019t tell what the word was, but it could as easily have been \u201cScalpel!\u201d The intonation\u2014and the result\u2014were the same.</p><p>One of the torchbearers hastily tugged the cane-knife from his loincloth, and slapped it into his leader\u2019s hand. Ishmael turned on his heel and in the same movement, drove the point of the knife deep into the crocodile\u2019s throat, just where the scales of the jaw joined those of the neck.</p><p>The blood welled black in the torchlight. All the men stepped back then, and stood at a safe distance, watching the dying frenzy of the great reptile with a respect mingled with deep satisfaction. Ishmael straightened, shirt a pale blur against the dark canes; unlike the other men, he was fully dressed, save for bare feet, and a number of small leather bags swung at his belt.</p><p>Owing to some freak of the nervous system, I had kept standing all this time. The increasingly urgent messages from my legs made it through to my brain at this point, and I sat down quite suddenly, my skirts billowing on the muddy ground.</p><p>The movement attracted Ishmael\u2019s notice; the narrow head turned in my direction, and his eyes widened. The other men, seeing him, turned also, and a certain amount of incredulous comment in several languages followed.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t paying much attention. The crocodile was still breathing, in stertorous, bubbling gasps. So was I. My eyes were fixed on the long scaled head, its eye with a slit pupil glowing the greenish gold of tourmaline, its oddly indifferent gaze seeming fixed in turn on me. The crocodile\u2019s grin was upside down, but still in place.</p><p>The mud was cool and smooth beneath my cheek, black as the thick stream that flowed between the lizard\u2019s scales. The tone of the questions and comments had changed to concern, but I was no longer listening.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t actually lost consciousness; I had a vague impression of jostling bodies and flickering light, and then I was lifted into the air, clutched tight in someone\u2019s arms. They were talking excitedly, but I caught only a word now and then. I dimly thought I should tell them to lay me down and cover me with something, but my tongue wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Leaves brushed my face as my escort ruthlessly shouldered the canes aside; it was like pushing through a cornfield that had no ears, all stalks and rustling leaves. There was no conversation among the men now; the susurrus of our passage drowned even the sound of footsteps.</p><p>By the time we entered the clearing by the slave huts, both sight and wits had returned to me. Bar scrapes and bruises, I wasn\u2019t hurt, but I saw no point in advertising the fact. I kept my eyes closed and stayed limp as I was carried into one of the huts, fighting back panic, and hoping to come up with some sensible plan before I was obliged to wake up officially.</p><p>Where in bloody hell were Jamie and the others? If all went well\u2014or worse, if it didn\u2019t\u2014what were they going to do when they arrived at the landing place and found me gone, with traces\u2014traces? the place was a bloody wallow!\u2014of a struggle where I had been?</p><p>And what about friend Ishmael? What in the name of all merciful God was he doing here? I knew one thing\u2014he wasn\u2019t bloody well cooking.</p><p>There was a good deal of festive noise outside the open door of the hut, and the scent of something alcoholic\u2014not rum, something raw and pungent\u2014floated in, a high note in the fuggy air of the hut, redolent of sweat and boiled yams. I cracked an eye and saw the reflected glimmer of firelight on the beaten earth. Shadows moved back and forth in front of the open door; I couldn\u2019t leave without being seen.</p><p>There was a general shout of triumph, and all the figures disappeared abruptly, in what I assumed was the direction of the fire. Presumably they were doing something to the crocodile, who had arrived when I did, swinging upside-down from the hunters\u2019 poles.</p><p>I rolled cautiously up onto my knees. Could I steal away while they were occupied with whatever they were doing? If I could make it to the nearest cane field, I was fairly sure they couldn\u2019t find me, but I was by no means so sure that I could find the river again, alone in the pitch-dark.</p><p>Ought I to make for the main house, instead, in hopes of running into Jamie and his rescue party? I shuddered slightly at the thought of the house, and the long, silent black form on the floor of the salon. But if I didn\u2019t go to either house or boat, how was I to find them, on a moonless night black as the Devil\u2019s armpit?</p><p>My planning was interrupted by a shadow in the doorway that momentarily blocked the light. I risked a peek, then sat bolt upright and screamed.</p><p>The figure came swiftly in and knelt by my pallet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019 you be makin\u2019 that noise, woman,\u201d Ishmael said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I said. Cold sweat prickled on my jaws and I could feel my heart pounding like a triphammer. \u201cKnew it all the time.\u201d</p><p>They had cut off the crocodile\u2019s head and sliced out the tongue and the floor of the mouth. He wore the huge, cold-eyed thing like a hat, his eyes no more than a gleam in the depths beneath the portcullised teeth. The empty lower jaw sagged, fat-jowled and grimly jovial, hiding the lower half of his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe egungun, he didn\u2019t hurt you none?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks to the men. Er...you wouldn\u2019t consider taking that off, would you?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the request and sat back on his heels, evidently considering me. I couldn\u2019t see his face, but every line of his body expressed the most profound indecision.</p><p>\u201cWhy you bein\u2019 here?\u201d he asked at last.</p> <p>For lack of any better idea, I told him. He didn\u2019t mean to bash me on the head, or he would have done it already, when I collapsed below the cane field.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, when I had finished. The reptile\u2019s snout dipped slightly toward me as he thought. A drop of moisture fell from the valved nostril onto my bare hand, and I wiped it quickly on my skirt, shuddering.</p><p>\u201cThe missus not here tonight,\u201d he said, at last, as though wondering whether it was safe to trust me with the information.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I said. I gathered my feet under me, preparing to rise. \u201cCan you\u2014or one of the men\u2014take me back to the big tree by the river? My husband will be looking for me,\u201d I added pointedly.</p><p>\u201cLikely she be takin\u2019 the boy with her,\u201d Ishmael went on, ignoring me.</p> <p>My heart had lifted when he had verified that Geilie was gone; now it fell, with a distinct thud in my chest.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taken Ian? Why?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see his face, but the eyes inside the crocodile mask shone with a gleam of something that was partly amusement\u2014but only partly.</p><p>\u201cMissus likes boys,\u201d he said, the malicious tone making his meaning quite clear.</p><p>\u201cDoes she,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cDo you know when she\u2019ll be coming back?\u201d</p><p>The long, toothy snout turned suddenly up, but before he could reply, I sensed someone standing behind me, and swung around on the pallet.</p> <p>\u201cI know you,\u201d she said, a small frown puckering the wide, smooth forehead as she looked down at me. \u201cDo I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d I said, trying to swallow the heart that had leapt into my mouth in startlement. \u201cHow\u2014how do you do, Miss Campbell?\u201d</p><p>Better than when last seen, evidently, in spite of the fact that her neat wool challis gown had been replaced with a loose smock of coarse white cotton, sashed with a broad, raggedly torn strip of the same, stained dark blue with indigo. Both face and figure had grown more slender, though, and she had lost the pasty, sagging look of too many months spent indoors.</p><p>\u201cI am well, I thank ye, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said politely. The pale blue eyes had still that distant, unfocused look to them, and despite the new sun-glow on her skin, it was clear that Miss Margaret Campbell was still not altogether in the here and now.</p><p>This impression was borne out by the fact that she appeared not to have noticed Ishmael\u2019s unconventional attire. Or to have noticed Ishmael himself, for that matter. She went on looking at me, a vague interest passing across her snub features.</p><p>\u201cIt is most civil in ye to call upon me, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said. \u201cMight I offer ye refreshment of some kind? A dish of tea, perhaps? We keep no claret, for my brother holds that strong spirits are a temptation to the lusts of the flesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay they are,\u201d I said, feeling that I could do with a brisk spot of temptation at the moment.</p><p>Ishmael had risen, and now bowed deeply to Miss Campbell, the great head slipping precariously.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready, b\u00e9b\u00e9?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cThe fire is waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d and turned to me.</p><p>\u201cWill ye not join me, Mrs. Malcolm?\u201d she asked graciously. \u201cTea will be served shortly. I do so enjoy looking into a nice fire,\u201d she confided, taking my arm as I rose. \u201cDo you not find yourself sometimes imagining that you see things in the flames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow and again,\u201d I said. I glanced at Ishmael, who was standing in the doorway. His indecision was apparent in his stance, but as Miss Campbell moved inexorably toward him, towing me after her, he shrugged very slightly, and stepped aside.</p><p>Outside, a small bonfire burned brightly in the center of the clearing before the row of huts. The crocodile had already been skinned; the raw hide was stretched on a frame near one of the huts, throwing a headless shadow on the wooden wall. Several sharpened sticks were thrust into the ground around the fire, each strung with chunks of meat, sizzling with an appetizing smell that nonetheless made my stomach clench.</p><p>Perhaps three dozen people, men, women and children, were gathered near the fire, laughing and talking. One man was still singing softly, curled over a battered guitar.</p><p>As we appeared, one man caught sight of us, and turned sharply, saying something that sounded like \u201cHau!\u201d At once, the talk and laughter stopped, and a respectful silence fell upon the crowd.</p><p>Ishmael walked slowly toward them, the crocodile\u2019s head grinning in apparent delight. The firelight shone off faces and bodies like polished jet and melted caramel, all with deep black eyes that watched us come.</p><p>There was a small bench near the fire, set on a sort of dais made of stacked planks. This was evidently the seat of honor, for Miss Campbell made for it directly, and gestured politely for me to sit down next to her.</p><p>I could feel the weight of eyes upon me, with expressions ranging from hostility to guarded curiosity, but most of the attention was for Miss Campbell. Glancing covertly around the circle of faces, I was struck by their strangeness. These were the faces of Africa, and alien to me; not faces like Joe\u2019s, that bore only the faint stamp of his ancestors, diluted by centuries of European blood. Black or not, Joe Abernathy was a great deal more like me than like these people\u2014different to the marrow of their bones.</p><p>The man with the guitar had put it aside, and drawn out a small drum that he set between his knees. The sides were covered with the hide of some spotted animal; goat, perhaps. He began to tap it softly with the palms of his hands, in a half-halting rhythm like the beating of a heart.</p><p>I glanced at Miss Campbell, sitting tranquil beside me, hands carefully folded in her lap. She was gazing straight ahead, into the leaping flames, with a small, dreaming smile on her lips.</p><p>The swaying crowd of slaves parted, and two little girls came out, carrying a large basket between them. The handle of the basket was twined with white roses, and the lid jerked up and down, agitated by the movements of something inside.</p><p>The girls set the basket at Ishmael\u2019s feet, casting awed glances up at his grotesque headdress. He rested a hand on each of their heads, murmured a few words, and then dismissed them, his upraised palms a startling flash of yellow-pink, like butterflies rising from the girls\u2019 knotted hair.</p><p>The attitude of the spectators had so far been quiet and respectful. It continued so, but now they crowded closer, necks craning to see what would happen next, and the drum began to beat faster, still softly. One of the women was holding a stone bottle, she took one step forward, handed it to Ishmael, and melted back into the crowd.</p><p>Ishmael took up the bottle of liquor and poured a small amount on the ground, moving carefully in a circle around the basket. The basket, momentarily quiescent, heaved to and fro, evidently disturbed by the movement or the pungent scent of alcohol.</p><p>A man holding a stick wrapped in rags stepped forward, and held the stick in the bonfire until the rags blazed up, bright red. At a word from Ishmael, he dipped his torch to the ground where the liquor had been poured. There was a collective \u201cAh!\u201d from the watchers as a ring of flame sprang up, burned blue and died away at once, as quickly as it came. From the basket came a loud \u201cCock-a-doodle-dooo!\u201d</p><p>Miss Campbell stirred beside me, eyeing the basket with suspicion.</p><p>As though the crowing had been a signal\u2014perhaps it was\u2014a flute began to play, and the humming of the crowd rose to a higher pitch.</p><p>Ishmael came toward the makeshift dais where we sat, holding a red headrag between his hands. This he tied about Margaret\u2019s wrist, placing her hand gently back in her lap when he had finished.</p><p>\u201cOh, there is my handkerchief!\u201d she exclaimed, and quite unselfconsciously raised her wrist and wiped her nose.</p><p>No one but me seemed to notice. The attention was on Ishmael, who was standing before the crowd, speaking in a language I didn\u2019t recognize. The c**k in the basket crowed again, and the white roses on the handle quivered violently with its struggles.</p><p>\u201cI do wish it wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d said Margaret Campbell, rather petulantly. \u201cIf it does again, it will be three times, and that\u2019s bad luck, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Ishmael was now pouring the rest of the liquor in a circle round the dais. I hoped the flame wouldn\u2019t startle her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, Archie says so. \u2018Before the c**k crows thrice, thou wilt betray me.\u2019 Archie says women are always betrayers. Is that so, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on your point of view, I suppose,\u201d I murmured, watching the proceedings. Miss Campbell seemed oblivious to the swaying, humming slaves, the music, the twitching basket, and Ishmael, who was collecting small objects handed to him out of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she said. \u201cI do hope the tea will be ready soon.\u201d</p><p>Ishmael heard this. To my amazement, he reached into one of the bags at his waist and unwrapped a small bundle, which proved to hold a cup of chipped and battered porcelain, the remnants of gold leaf still visible on the rim. This he placed ceremoniously on her lap.</p><p>\u201cOh, goody,\u201d Margaret said happily, clapping her hands together. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019ll be biscuits.\u201d</p><p>I rather thought not. Ishmael had placed the objects given him by the crowd along the edge of the dais. A few small bones, with lines carved across them, a spray of jasmine, and two or three crude little figures made of wood, each one wrapped in a scrap of cloth, with little shocks of hair glued to the head-nubbins with clay.</p><p>Ishmael spoke again, the torch dipped, and a sudden whiff of blue flame shot up around the dais. As it died away, leaving the scent of scorched earth and burnt brandy heavy in the cool night air, he opened the basket and brought out the cock.</p><p>It was a large, healthy bird, black feathers glistening in the torchlight. It struggled madly, uttering piercing squawks, but it was firmly trussed, its feet wrapped in cloth to prevent scratching. Ishmael bowed low, saying something, and handed the bird to Margaret.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d she said graciously.</p><p>The c**k stretched out its neck, wattles bright red with agitation, and crowed piercingly. Margaret shook it.</p><p>\u201cNaughty bird!\u201d she said crossly, and raising it to her mouth, bit it just behind the head.</p><p>I heard the soft crack of the neck bones and the little grunt of effort as she flung her head up, wrenching off the head of the hapless cock.</p><p>She clutched the gurgling, struggling trussed carcass tight against her bosom, crooning, \u201cNow, then, now, then, it\u2019s all right, darling,\u201d as the blood spurted and sprayed into the teacup and all over her dress.</p><p>The crowd had cried out at first, but now was quite still, watching. The flute, too, had fallen silent, but the drum beat on, sounding much louder than before.</p><p>Margaret dropped the drained carcass carelessly to one side, where a boy darted out of the crowd to retrieve it. She brushed absently at the blood on her skirt, picking up the teacup with her red-swathed hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGuests first,\u201d she said politely. \u201cWill you have one lump, Mrs. Malcolm, or two?\u201d</p><p>I was fortunately saved from answering by Ishmael, who thrust a crude horn cup into my hands, indicating that I should drink from it. Considering the alternative, I raised it to my mouth without hesitation.</p><p>It was fresh-distilled rum, sharp and raw enough to strip the throat, and I choked, wheezing. The tang of some herb rose up the back of my throat and into my nose; something had been mixed with the liquor, or soaked in it. It was faintly tart, but not unpleasant.</p><p>Other cups like mine were making their way from hand to hand through the crowd. Ishmael made a sharp gesture, indicating that I should drink more. I obediently raised the cup to my lips, but let the fiery liquid lap against my mouth without swallowing. Whatever was happening here, I thought I might need such wits as I had.</p> <p>Beside me, Miss Campbell was drinking from her teetotal cup with genteel sips. The feeling of expectancy among the crowd was rising; they were swaying now, and a woman had begun to sing, low and husky, her voice an offbeat counterpoint to the thump of the drum.</p><p>The shadow of Ishmael\u2019s headdress fell across my face, and I looked up. He too was swaying slowly, back and forth. The collarless white shirt he wore was speckled over the shoulders with black dots of blood, and stuck to his breast with sweat. I thought suddenly that the raw crocodile\u2019s head must weigh thirty pounds at least, a terrible weight to support; the muscles of his neck and shoulders were taut with effort.</p><p>He raised his hands and began to sing as well. I felt a shiver run down my back and coil at the base of my spine, where my tail would have been. With his face masked, the voice could have been Joe\u2019s; deep and honeyed, with a power that commanded attention. If I closed my eyes, it was Joe, with the light glinting off his spectacles, and catching the gold tooth far back as he smiled.</p><p>Then I opened my eyes again, half-shocked to see instead the crocodile\u2019s sinister yawn, and the fire gold-green in the cold, cruel eyes. My mouth was dry and there was a faint buzzing in my ears, weaving around the strong, sweet words.</p><p>He was getting attention, all right; the night by the fire was full of eyes, black-wide and shiny, and small moans and shouts marked the pauses in the song.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and shook my head hard. I grabbed the edge of the wooden bench, clinging to its rough reality. I wasn\u2019t drunk, I knew; whatever herb had been mixed with the rum was potent. I could feel it creeping snakelike through my blood, and kept my eyes tight closed, fighting its progress.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t block my ears, though, or the sound of that voice, rising and falling.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how much time had passed. I came back to myself with a start, suddenly aware that the drum and the singing had stopped.</p><p>There was an absolute silence around the fire. I could hear the small rush of flame, and the rustle of cane leaves in the night wind; the quick darting scuttle of a rat in the palm-frond roof of the hut behind me.</p><p>The drug was still in my bloodstream, but the effects were dying; I could feel clarity coming back to my thoughts. Not so for the crowd; the eyes were fixed in a single, unblinking stare, like a wall of mirrors, and I thought suddenly of the voodoo legends of my time\u2014of zombies and the houngans who made them. What had Geilie said? Every legend has one foot on the truth.</p><p>Ishmael spoke. He had taken off the crocodile\u2019s head. It lay on the ground at our feet, eyes gone dark in the shadow.</p> <p>\u201cIls sont arriv\u00e9es,\u201d Ishmael said quietly. They have come. He lifted his wet face, lined with exhaustion, and turned to the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWho asks?\u201d</p><p>As though in response, a young woman in a turban moved out of the crowd, still swaying, half-dazed, and sank down on the ground before the dais. She put her hand on one of the carved images, a crude wooden icon in the shape of a pregnant woman.</p><p>Her eyes looked up with hope, and while I didn\u2019t recognize the words she spoke, it was clear what she asked.</p><p>\u201cAya, gado.\u201d The voice spoke from beside me, but it wasn\u2019t Margaret Campbell\u2019s. It was the voice of an old woman, cracked and high, but confident, answering in the affirmative.</p><p>The young woman gasped with joy, and prostrated herself on the ground. Ishmael nudged her gently with a foot; she got up quickly and backed into the crowd, clutching the small image and bobbing her head, murmuring \u201cMana, mana,\u201d over and over.</p><p>Next was a young man, by his face the brother of the first young woman, who squatted respectfully upon his haunches, touching his head before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cGrandm\u00e8re,\u201d he began, in high, nasal French. Grandmother? I thought.</p> <p>He asked his question looking shyly down at the ground. \u201cDoes the woman I love return my love?\u201d His was the jasmine spray; he held it so that it brushed the top of a bare, dusty foot.</p><p>The woman beside me laughed, her ancient voice ironic but not unkind. \u201cCertainement,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe returns it; and that of three other men, besides. Find another; less generous, but more worthy.\u201d</p><p>The young man retired, crestfallen, to be replaced by an older man. This one spoke in an African language I did not know, a tone of bitterness in his voice as he touched one of the clay figures.</p><p>\u201cSetato hoye,\u201d said\u2014who? The voice had changed. The voice of a man this time, full-grown but not elderly, answering in the same language with an angry tone.</p><p>I stole a look to the side, and despite the heat of the fire, felt the chill ripple up my forearms. It was Margaret\u2019s face no longer. The outlines were the same, but the eyes were bright, alert and focused on the petitioner, the mouth set in grim command, and the pale throat swelled like a frog\u2019s with the effort of strong speech as whoever-it-was argued with the man.</p><p>\u201cThey are here,\u201d Ishmael had said. \u201cThey,\u201d indeed. He stood to one side, silent but watchful, and I saw his eyes rest on me for a second before coming back to Margaret. Or whatever had been Margaret.</p><p>\u201cThey.\u201d One by one the people came forward, to kneel and ask. Some spoke in English, some French, or the slave patois, some in the African speech of their vanished homes. I couldn\u2019t understand all that was said, but when the questions were in French or English, they were often prefaced by a respectful \u201cGrandfather,\u201d or \u201cGrandmother,\u201d once by \u201cAunt.\u201d</p><p>Both the face and the voice of the oracle beside me changed, as \u201cthey\u201d came to answer their call; male and female, mostly middle-aged or old, their shadows dancing on her face with the flicker of the fire.</p><p>Do you not sometimes imagine that you see things in the fire? The echo of her own small voice came back to me, thin and childish.</p><p>Listening, I felt the hair rise on the back of my neck, and understood for the first time what had brought Ishmael back to this place, risking recapture and renewed slavery. Not friendship, not love, nor any loyalty to his fellow slaves, but power.</p><p>What price is there for the power to tell the future? Any price, was the answer I saw, looking out at the rapt faces of the congregation. He had come back for Margaret.</p><p>It went on for some time. I didn\u2019t know how long the drug would last, but I saw people here and there sink down to the ground, and nod to sleep; others melted silently back to the darkness of the huts, and after a time, we were almost alone. Only a few remained around the fire, all men.</p><p>They were all husky and confident, and from their attitude, accustomed to command some respect, among slaves at least. They had hung back, together as a group, watching the proceedings, until at last one, clearly the leader, stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cThey be done, mon,\u201d he said to Ishmael, with a jerk of his head toward the sleeping forms around the fire. \u201cNow you ask.\u201d</p><p>Ishmael\u2019s face showed nothing but a slight smile, yet he seemed suddenly nervous. Perhaps it was the closing in of the other men. There was nothing overtly menacing about them, but they seemed both serious and intent\u2014not upon Margaret, for a change, but upon Ishmael.</p><p>At last he nodded, and turned to face Margaret. During the hiatus, her face had gone blank; no one at home.</p><p>\u201cBouassa,\u201d he said to her. \u201cCome you, Bouassa.\u201d</p><p>I shrank involuntarily away, as far as I could get on the bench without falling into the fire. Whoever Bouassa was, he had come promptly.</p><p>\u201cI be hearin\u2019.\u201d It was a voice as deep as Ishmael\u2019s, and should have been as pleasant. It wasn\u2019t. One of the men took an involuntary step backward.</p><p>Ishmael stood alone; the other men seemed to shrink away from him, as though he suffered some contamination.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I want to know, you Bouassa,\u201d he said.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s head tilted slightly, a light of amusement in the pale blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat you want to know?\u201d the deep voice said, with mild scorn. \u201cFor why, mon? You be goin\u2019, I tell you anything or not.\u201d</p><p>The small smile on Ishmael\u2019s face echoed that on Bouassa\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou say true,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut these\u2014\u201d He jerked his head toward his companions, not taking his eyes from the face. \u201cThey be goin\u2019 with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well,\u201d the deep voice said. It chuckled, rather unpleasantly. \u201cThe Maggot dies in three days. Won\u2019t be nothin\u2019 for them here. That all you be wantin\u2019 with me?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, Bouassa yawned widely, and a loud belch erupted from Margaret\u2019s dainty mouth.</p><p>Her mouth closed, and her eyes resumed their vacant stare, but the men weren\u2019t noticing. An excited chatter erupted from them, to be hushed by Ishmael, with a significant glance at me. Abruptly quiet, they moved away, still muttering, glancing at me as they went.</p><p>Ishmael closed his eyes as the last man left the clearing, and his shoulders sagged. I felt a trifle drained myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I began, and then stopped. Across the fire, a man had stepped from the shelter of the sugarcane. Jamie, tall as the cane itself, with the dying fire staining shirt and face as red as his hair.</p><p>He raised a finger to his lips, and I nodded. I gathered my feet cautiously beneath me, picking up my stained skirt in one hand. I could be up, past the fire, and into the cane with him before Ishmael could reach me. But Margaret?</p><p>I hesitated, turned to look at her, and saw that her face had come alive once again. It was lifted, eager, lips parted and shining eyes narrowed so that they seemed slightly slanted, as she stared across the fire.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d said Brianna\u2019s voice beside me.</p><p>The hairs rippled softly erect on my forearms. It was Brianna\u2019s voice, Brianna\u2019s face, blue eyes dark and slanting with eagerness.</p><p>\u201cBree?\u201d I whispered, and the face turned to me.</p><p>\u201cMama,\u201d said my daughter\u2019s voice, from the throat of the oracle.</p><p>\u201cBrianna,\u201d said Jamie, and she turned her head sharply to look at him.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d she said, with great certainty. \u201cI knew it was you. I\u2019ve been dreaming about you.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face was white with shock. I saw his lips form the word \u201cJesus,\u201d without sound, and his hand moved instinctively to cross himself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Mama go alone,\u201d said the voice with great certainty. \u201cYou go with her. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no sound save the crackling of the fire. Ishmael stood transfixed, staring at the woman beside me. Then she spoke again, in Brianna\u2019s soft, husky tones.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy. You too, Mama.\u201d She leaned toward me, and I smelled the fresh blood. Then her lips touched mine, and I screamed.</p><p>I was not conscious of leaping to my feet, or of crossing the clearing. All I knew was that I was clinging to Jamie, my face buried in the cloth of his coat, shaking.</p><p>His heart was pounding under my cheek, and I thought that he was shaking, too. I felt his hand trace the sign of the cross upon my back, and his arm lock tight about my shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, and I could feel his ribs swell and brace with the effort of keeping his voice steady. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to look, but forced myself to turn my head toward the fire.</p><p>It was a peaceful scene. Margaret Campbell sat quietly on her bench, humming to herself, twiddling a long black tailfeather upon her knee. Ishmael stood behind her, one hand smoothing her hair in what looked like tenderness. He murmured something to her in a low, liquid tongue\u2014a question\u2014and she smiled placidly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not a scrap tired!\u201d she assured him, turning to look fondly up into the scarred face that hovered in the darkness above her. \u201cSuch a nice party, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, b\u00e9b\u00e9,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut you rest now, eh?\u201d He turned and clicked his tongue loudly. Suddenly two of the turbaned women materialized out of the night; they must have been waiting, just within call. Ishmael said something to them, and they came at once to tend Margaret, lifting her to her feet and leading her away between them, murmuring soft endearments in African and French.</p> <p>Ishmael remained, watching us across the fire. He was still as one of Geilie\u2019s idols, carved out of night.</p><p>\u201cI did not come alone,\u201d Jamie said. He gestured casually over his shoulder toward the cane field behind him, implying armed regiments.</p><p>\u201cOh, you be alone, mon,\u201d Ishmael said, with a slight smile. \u201cNo matter. The loa speak to you; you be safe from me.\u201d He glanced back and forth between us, appraising.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he said, in a tone of interest. \u201cNever did hear a loa speak to buckra.\u201d He shook his head then, dismissing the matter.</p><p>\u201cYou be going now,\u201d he said, quietly but with considerable authority.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Jamie\u2019s arm dropped from my shoulder, and he straightened up beside me. \u201cI have come for the boy Ian; I will not go without him.\u201d</p> <p>Ishmael\u2019s brows went up, compressing the three vertical scars between them.</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he said again. \u201cYou forget that boy; he be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone where?\u201d Jamie asked sharply.</p><p>The narrow head tilted to one side, as Ishmael looked him over carefully.</p><p>\u201cGone with the Maggot, mon,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd where she go, you don\u2019 be going. That boy gone, mon,\u201d he said again, with finality. \u201cYou leave too, you a wise man.\u201d He paused, listening. A drum was talking, somewhere far away, the pulse of it little more than a disturbance of the night air.</p><p>\u201cThe rest be comin\u2019 soon,\u201d he remarked. \u201cYou safe from me, mon, not from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the rest?\u201d I asked. The terror of the encounter with the loa was ebbing, and I was able to talk once more, though my spine still rippled with fear of the dark cane field at my back.</p><p>\u201cMaroons, I expect,\u201d Jamie said. He raised a brow at Ishmael. \u201cOr ye will be?\u201d</p> <p>The priest nodded, one formal bob of the head.</p><p>\u201cThat be true,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hear Bouassa speak? His loa bless us, we go.\u201d He gestured toward the huts and the dark hills behind them. \u201cThe drum callin\u2019 them down from the hills, those strong enough to go.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, the conversation obviously at an end.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Jamie said. \u201cTell us where she has gone\u2014Mrs. Abernathy and the boy!\u201d</p><p>Ishmael turned back, shoulders mantled in the crocodile\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cTo Abandawe,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s that?\u201d Jamie demanded impatiently. I put a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cI know where it is,\u201d I said, and Ishmael\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment. \u201cAt least\u2014I know it\u2019s on Hispaniola. Lawrence told me. That was what Geilie wanted from him\u2014to find out where it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? A town, a village? Where?\u201d I could feel Jamie\u2019s arm tense under my hand, vibrating with the urgency to be gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cave,\u201d I said, feeling cold in spite of the balmy air and the nearness of the fire. \u201cAn old cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbandawe a magic place,\u201d Ishmael put in, deep voice soft, as though he feared to speak of it out loud. He looked at me hard, reassessing. \u201cClotilda say the Maggot take you to the room upstairs. You maybe be knowin\u2019 what she do there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d My mouth felt dry. I remembered Geilie\u2019s hands, soft and plump and white, laying out the gems in their patterns, talking lightly of blood.</p><p>As though he caught the echo of this thought, Ishmael took a sudden step toward me.</p><p>\u201cI ask you, woman\u2014you still bleed?\u201d</p><p>Jamie jerked under my hand, but I squeezed his arm to be still.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy? What has that to do with it?\u201d</p><p>The oniseegun was plainly uneasy; he glanced from me back toward the huts. A stir was perceptible in the dark behind him; many bodies were moving to and fro, with a mutter of voices like the whisper of the cane fields. They were getting ready to go.</p><p>\u201cA woman bleeds, she kill magic. You bleed, got your woman-power, the magic don\u2019t work for you. It the old women do magic; witch someone, call the loas, make sick, make well.\u201d He gave me a long, appraising look, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019 gone do the magic, what the Maggot do. That magic kill her, sure, but it kill you, too.\u201d He gestured behind him, toward the empty bench. \u201cYou hear Bouassa speak? He say the Maggot die, three days. She taken the boy, he die. You go follow them, mon, you die, too, sure.\u201d</p><p>He stared at Jamie, and raised his hands in front of him, wrists crossed as though bound together. \u201cI tell you, amiki,\u201d he said. He let his hands fall, jerking them apart, breaking the invisible bond. He turned abruptly, and vanished into the darkness, where the shuffle of feet was growing louder, punctuated with bumps as heavy objects were shifted.</p><p>\u201cHoly Michael defend us,\u201d muttered Jamie. He ran a hand hard through his hair, making fiery wisps stand out in the flickering light. The fire was dying fast, with no one left to tend it.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken this place, Sassenach? Where Geillis has gone wi\u2019 Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, all I know is that it\u2019s somewhere up in the far hills on Hispaniola, and that a stream runs through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we must take Stern,\u201d he said with decision. \u201cCome on; the lads are by the river wi\u2019 the boat.\u201d</p><p>I turned to follow him, but paused on the edge of the cane field to look back.</p><p>\u201cJamie! Look!\u201d Behind us lay the embers of the egungun\u2019s fire, and the shadowy ring of slave huts. Farther away, the bulk of Rose Hall made a light patch against the hillside. But farther still, beyond the shoulder of the hill, the sky glowed faintly red.</p><p>\u201cThat will be Howe\u2019s place, burning,\u201d he said. He sounded oddly calm, without emotion. He pointed to the left, toward the flank of the mountain, where a small orange dot glowed, no more at this distance than a pinprick of light. \u201cAnd that will be Twelvetrees, I expect.\u201d</p><p>The drum-voice whispered through the night, up and down the river. What had Ishmael said? The drum callin\u2019 them down from the hills\u2014those strong enough to go.</p><p>A small line of slaves was coming down from the huts, women carrying babies and bundles, cooking pots slung over their shoulders, heads turbaned in white. Next to one young woman, who held her arm with careful respect, walked Margaret Campbell, likewise turbaned.</p><p>Jamie saw her, and stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cMiss Campbell!\u201d he said sharply. \u201cMargaret!\u201d</p><p>Margaret and her attendant stopped; the young woman moved as though to step between her charge and Jamie, but he held up both hands as he came, to show he meant no harm, and she reluctantly stepped back.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d he said. \u201cMargaret, do ye not know me?\u201d</p><p>She stared vacantly at him. Very slowly, he touched her, holding her face between his hands.</p><p>\u201cMargaret,\u201d he said to her, low-voiced, urgent. \u201cMargaret, hear me! D\u2019ye ken me, Margaret?\u201d</p><p>She blinked once, then twice, and the smooth round face melted and thawed into life. It was not like the sudden possession of the loas; this was a slow, tentative coming, of something shy and fearful.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken ye, Jamie,\u201d she said at last. Her voice was rich and pure, a young girl\u2019s voice. Her lips curled up, and her eyes came alive once more, her face still held in the hollow of his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been lang since I saw ye, Jamie,\u201d she said, looking up into his eyes. \u201cWill ye have word of Ewan, then? Is he well?\u201d</p><p>He stood very still for a minute, his face that careful blank mask that hid strong feeling.</p><p>\u201cHe is well,\u201d he whispered at last. \u201cVerra well, Margaret. He gave me this, to keep until I saw ye.\u201d He bent his head and kissed her gently.</p><p>Several of the women had stopped, standing silently by to watch. At this, they moved and began to murmur, glancing uneasily at each other. When he released Margaret Campbell and stepped back, they closed in around her, protective and wary, nodding him back.</p><p>Margaret seemed oblivious; her eyes were still on Jamie\u2019s face, the smile on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, Jamie!\u201d she called, as her attendant took her arm and began to urge her away. \u201cTell Ewan I\u2019ll be with him soon!\u201d The little band of white-clothed women moved away, disappearing like ghosts into the darkness by the cane field.</p><p>Jamie made an impulsive move in their direction, but I stopped him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d I whispered, mindful of what lay on the floor in the salon of the plantation house. \u201cJamie, let her go. You can\u2019t stop her; she\u2019s better with them.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, you\u2019re right.\u201d He turned, then stopped suddenly, and I whirled about to see what he had seen. There were lights in Rose Hall now. Torchlight, flickering behind the windows, upstairs and down. As we watched, a surly glow began to swell in the windows of the secret workroom on the second floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past time to go,\u201d Jamie said. He seized my hand and we went quickly, diving into the dark rustle of the canes, fleeing through air suddenly thick with the smell of burning sugar.</p><p>62</p><p>ABANDAWE</p><p>\u201cYou can take the Governor\u2019s pinnace; that\u2019s small, but it\u2019s seaworthy.\u201d Grey fumbled through the drawer of his desk. \u201cI\u2019ll write an order for the dockers to hand it over to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we\u2019ll need the boat\u2014I canna risk the Artemis; as she\u2019s Jared\u2019s\u2014but I think we\u2019d best steal it, John.\u201d Jamie\u2019s brows were drawn together in a frown. \u201cI wouldna have ye be involved wi\u2019 me in any visible way, aye? You\u2019ll be having trouble enough with things, without that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grey smiled unhappily. \u201cTrouble? Yes, you might call it trouble, with four plantation houses burnt, and over two hundred slaves gone\u2014God knows where! But I vastly doubt that anyone will take notice of my social acquaintance, under the circumstances. Between fear of the Maroons and fear of the Chinaman, the whole island is in such a panic that a mere smuggler is the most negligible of trivialities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great relief to me to be thought trivial,\u201d Jamie said, very dryly. \u201cStill, we\u2019ll steal the boat. And if we\u2019re taken, ye\u2019ve never heard my name or seen my face, aye?\u201d</p><p>Grey stared at him, a welter of emotions fighting for mastery of his features, amusement, fear, and anger among them.</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d he said at last. \u201cLet you be taken, watch them hang you, and keep quiet about it\u2014for fear of smirching my reputation? For God\u2019s sake, Jamie, what do you take me for?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie\u2019s mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>\u201cFor a friend, John,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019ll take your friendship\u2014and your damned boat!\u2014then you\u2019ll take mine, and keep quiet. Aye?\u201d</p><p>The Governor glared at him for a moment, lips pressed tight, but then his shoulders sagged in defeat.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cBut I should regard it as a great personal favor if you would endeavor not to be captured.\u201d</p><p>Jamie rubbed a knuckle across his mouth, hiding a smile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try verra hard, John.\u201d</p><p>The Governor sat down, wearily. There were deep circles under his eyes, and his impeccable linen was wilted; obviously he had not changed his clothes from the day before.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, and it\u2019s likely better I don\u2019t. But if you can, keep out of the sealanes north of Antigua. I sent a boat this morning, to ask for as many men as the barracks there can supply, marines and sailors both. They\u2019ll be heading this way by the day after tomorrow at the latest, to guard the town and harbor against the escaped Maroons in case of an outright rebellion.\u201d</p><p>I caught Jamie\u2019s eye, and raised one brow in question, but he shook his head, almost imperceptibly. We had told the Governor of the uprising on the Yallahs River, and the escape of the slaves\u2014something he had heard about from other sources, anyway. We had not told him what we had seen later that night, lying to under cover of a tiny cove, sails taken down to hide their whiteness.</p><p>The river was dark as onyx, but with a fugitive gleam from the broad expanse of water. We had heard them coming, and had time to hide before the ship came down upon us; the beating of drums and a savage exultation of many voices echoing through the river valley as the Bruja sailed past us, carried by the downward current. The bodies of the pirates no doubt lay somewhere upriver, left to rot peacefully among the frangipani and cedar.</p><p>The escaped slaves of the Yallahs River had not gone into the mountains of Jamaica, but out to sea, presumably to join Bouassa\u2019s followers on Hispaniola. The townsfolk of Kingston had nothing to fear from the escaped slaves\u2014but it was a good deal better that the Royal Navy should concentrate their attention here than on Hispaniola, where we were bound.</p> <p>Jamie rose to take our leave, but Grey stopped him.</p><p>\u201cWait. Will you not require a safe place for your\u2014for Mrs. Fraser?\u201d He didn\u2019t look at me, but at Jamie, eyes steady. \u201cI should be honored if you would entrust her to my protection. She could stay here, in the Residence, until you return. No one would trouble her\u2014or even need to know she was here.\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated, but there was no gentle way to phrase it.</p><p>\u201cShe must go with me, John,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no choice about it; she must.\u201d</p><p>Grey\u2019s glance flickered to me, then away, but not before I had seen the look of jealousy in his eyes. I felt sorry for him, but there was nothing I could say; no way to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and swallowed noticeably. \u201cI see. Quite.\u201d</p><p>Jamie held out a hand to him. He hesitated for a moment, but then took it.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Jamie,\u201d he said, voice a little husky. \u201cGod go with you.\u201d</p> <p>Fergus had been somewhat more difficult to deal with. He had insisted absolutely on accompanying us, offering argument after argument, and arguing the more vehemently when he found that the Scottish smugglers would sail with us.</p><p>\u201cYou take them, but you will go without me?\u201d Fergus\u2019s face was alive with indignation.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cThe smugglers are widowers or bachelors, all, but you\u2019re a marrit man.\u201d He glanced pointedly at Marsali, who stood watching the discussion, her face drawn with anxiety. \u201cI thought she was oweryoung to be wed, and I was wrong; but I know she\u2019s oweryoung to be widowed. You\u2019ll stay.\u201d And he turned aside, the matter settled.</p><p>It was full dark when we set sail in Grey\u2019s pinnace, a thirty-foot, single-decked sloop, leaving two docksmen bound and gagged in the boathouse behind us. It was a small, single-masted ship, bigger than the fishing boat in which we had traveled up the Yallahs River, but barely large enough to qualify for the designation \u201cship.\u201d</p><p>Nonetheless, she seemed seaworthy enough, and we were soon out of Kingston Harbor, heeling over in a brisk evening breeze, on our way toward Hispaniola.</p><p>The smugglers handled the sailing among them, leaving Jamie, Lawrence and I to sit on one of the long benches along the rail. We chatted desultorily of this and that, but after a time, fell silent, absorbed in our own thoughts.</p><p>Jamie yawned repeatedly, and finally, at my urging, consented to lie down upon the bench, his head resting in my lap. I was myself strung too tightly to want to sleep.</p><p>Lawrence too was wakeful, staring upward into the sky, hands folded behind his head.</p><p>\u201cThere is moisture in the air tonight,\u201d he said, nodding upward toward the silver sliver of the crescent moon. \u201cSee the haze about the moon? It may rain before dawn; unusual for this time of year.\u201d</p><p>Talk about the weather seemed sufficiently boring to soothe my jangled nerves. I stroked Jamie\u2019s hair, thick and soft under my hand.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I said. \u201cYou and Jamie both seem able to read the weather from the sky. All I know is the old bit about \u2018Red sky at night, sailor\u2019s delight; red sky at morning, sailor take warning.\u2019 I didn\u2019t notice what color the sky was tonight, did you?\u201d</p><p>Lawrence laughed comfortably. \u201cRather a light purple,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot say whether it will be red in the morning, but it is surprising how frequently such signs are reliable. But of course there is a scientific principle involved\u2014the refraction of light from the moisture in the air, just as I observed presently of the moon.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin, enjoying the breeze that lifted the heavy hair that fell on my neck.</p><p>\u201cBut what about odd phenomena? Supernatural things?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhat about things where the rules of science seem not to apply?\u201d I am a scientist, I heard him say in memory, his slight accent seeming only to reinforce his matter-of-factness. I don\u2019t believe in ghosts.</p><p>\u201cSuch as what, these phenomena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I groped for a moment, then fell back on Geilie\u2019s own examples. \u201cPeople who have bleeding stigmata, for example? Astral travel? Visions, supernatural manifestations...odd things, that can\u2019t be explained rationally.\u201d</p><p>Lawrence grunted, and settled his bulk more comfortably on the bench beside me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I say it is the place of science only to observe,\u201d he said. \u201cTo seek cause where it may be found, but to realize that there are many things in the world for which no cause shall be found; not because it does not exist, but because we know too little to find it. It is not the place of science to insist on explanation\u2014but only to observe, in hopes that the explanation will manifest itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be science, but it isn\u2019t human nature,\u201d I objected. \u201cPeople go on wanting explanations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do.\u201d He was becoming interested in the discussion; he leaned back, folding his hands across his slight paunch, in a lecturer\u2019s attitude. \u201cIt is for this reason that a scientist constructs hypotheses\u2014suggestions for the cause of an observation. But a hypothesis must never be confused with an explanation\u2014with proof.</p><p>\u201cI have seen a great many things which might be described as peculiar. Fish-falls, for instance, where a great many fish\u2014all of the same species, mind you, all the same size\u2014fall suddenly from a clear sky, over dry land. There would appear to be no rational cause for this\u2014and yet, is it therefore suitable to attribute the phenomenon to supernatural interference? On the face of it, does it seem more likely that some celestial intelligence should amuse itself by flinging shoals of fish at us from the sky, or that there is some meteorological phenomenon\u2014a waterspout, a tornado, something of the kind?\u2014that while not visible to us, is still in operation? And yet\u201d\u2014his voice became more pensive\u2014\u201cwhy\u2014and how!\u2014might a natural phenomenon such as a waterspout remove the heads\u2014and only the heads\u2014of all the fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen such a thing yourself?\u201d I asked, interested, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cThere speaks a scientific mind!\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cThe first thing a scientist asks\u2014how do you know? Who has seen it? Can I see it myself? Yes, I have seen such a thing\u2014three times, in fact, though in one case the precipitation was of frogs, rather than fish.</p><p>\u201cWere you near a seashore or a lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce near a shore, once near a lake\u2014that was the frogs\u2014but the third time, it took place far inland; some twenty miles from the nearest body of water. And yet the fish were of a kind I have seen only in the deep ocean. In none of the cases did I see any sort of disturbance of the upper air\u2014no clouds, no great wind, none of the fabled spouts of water that rise from the sea into the sky, assuredly. And yet the fish fell; so much is a fact, for I have seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it isn\u2019t a fact if you haven\u2019t seen it?\u201d I asked dryly.</p><p>He laughed in delight, and Jamie stirred, murmuring against my thigh. I smoothed his hair, and he relaxed into sleep again.</p><p>\u201cIt may be so; it may not. But a scientist could not say, could he? What is it the Christian Bible says\u2014\u2018Blest are they who have not seen, but have believed\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it says, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things must be accepted as fact without provable cause.\u201d He laughed again, this time without much humor. \u201cAs a scientist who is also a Jew, I have perhaps a different perspective on such phenomena as stigmata\u2014and the idea of resurrection of the dead, which a very great proportion of the civilized world accepts as fact beyond question. And yet, this skeptical view is not one I could even breathe, to anyone save yourself, without grave danger of personal harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubting Thomas was a Jew, after all,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cTo begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes; and only when he ceased to doubt, did he become a Christian\u2014and a martyr. One could argue that it was surety that killed him, no?\u201d His voice was heavy with irony. \u201cThere is a great difference between those phenomena which are accepted on faith, and those which are proved by objective determination, though the cause of both may be equally \u2018rational\u2019 once known. And the chief difference is this: that people will treat with disdain such phenomena as are proved by the evidence of the senses, and commonly experienced\u2014while they will defend to the death the reality of a phenomenon which they have neither seen nor experienced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFaith is as powerful a force as science,\u201d he concluded, voice soft in the darkness, \u201c\u2014but far more dangerous.\u201d</p><p>We sat quietly for a time, looking over the bow of the tiny ship, toward the thin slice of darkness that divided the night, darker than the purple glow of the sky, or the silver-gray sea. The black island of Hispaniola, drawing inexorably closer.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you see the headless fish?\u201d I asked suddenly, and was not surprised to see the faint inclination of his head toward the bow.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen a good many odd things among these islands\u2014but perhaps more there than anywhere else. Some places are like that.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t speak for several minutes, pondering what might lie ahead\u2014and hoping that Ishmael had been right in saying that it was Ian whom Geillis had taken with her to Abandawe. A thought occurred to me\u2014one that had been lost or pushed aside during the events of the last twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cLawrence\u2014the other Scottish boys. Ishmael told us he saw twelve of them, including Ian. When you were searching the plantation...did you find any trace of the others?\u201d</p><p>He drew in his breath sharply, but did not answer at once. I could feel him, turning over words in his mind, trying to decide how to say what the chill in my bones had already told me.</p><p>The answer, when it came, was not from Lawrence, but from Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWe found them,\u201d he said softly, from the darkness. His hand rested on my knee, and squeezed gently. \u201cDinna ask more, Sassenach\u2014for I willna tell ye.\u201d</p> <p>I understood. Ishmael had to have been right; it must be Ian with Geilie, for Jamie could bear no other possibility. I laid a hand on his head, and he stirred slightly, turning so that his breath touched my hand.</p><p>\u201cBlest are they who have not seen,\u201d I whispered under my breath, \u201cbut have believed.\u201d</p><p>We dropped anchor near dawn, in a small, nameless bay on the northern coast of Hispaniola. There was a narrow beach, faced with cliffs, and through a split in the rock, a narrow, sandy trail was visible, leading into the interior of the island.</p><p>Jamie carried me the few steps to shore, set me down, and then turned to Innes, who had splashed ashore with one of the parcels of food.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, a charaid,\u201d he said formally. \u201cWe shall part here; with the Virgin\u2019s blessing, we will meet here again in four days\u2019 time.\u201d</p><p>Innes\u2019s narrow face contracted in surprised disappointment; then resignation settled on his features.</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll mind the boatie then, \u2019til ye all come back.\u201d</p><p>Jamie saw the expression, and shook his head, smiling.</p><p>\u201cNot just you, man; did I need a strong arm, it would be yours I should call on first. No, all of ye shall stay, save my wife and the Jew.\u201d</p><p>Resignation was replaced by sheer surprise.</p><p>\u201cStay here? All of us? But will ye not have need of us, Mac Dubh?\u201d He squinted anxiously at the cliffs, with their burden of flowering vines. \u201cIt looks a fearsome place to venture into, without friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall count it the act of greatest friendship for ye to wait here, as I say, Duncan,\u201d Jamie said, and I realized with a slight shock that I had never known Innes\u2019s given name.</p><p>Innes glanced again at the cliffs, his lean face troubled, then bent his head in acquiescence.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s you as shall say, Mac Dubh. But ye ken we are willing\u2014all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie nodded, his face turned away.</p><p>\u201cAye, I ken that fine, Duncan,\u201d he said softly. Then he turned back, held out an arm, and Innes embraced him, his one arm awkwardly thumping Jamie\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cIf a ship should come,\u201d Jamie said, letting go, \u201cthen I wish ye to take heed for yourselves. The Royal Navy will be looking for that pinnace, aye? I doubt they shall come here, looking, but if they should\u2014or if anything else at all should threaten ye\u2014then leave. Sail away at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave ye here? Nay, ye can order me to do a great many things, Mac Dubh, and do them I shall\u2014but not that.\u201d</p><p>Jamie frowned and shook his head; the rising sun struck sparks from his hair and the stubble of his beard, wreathing his head in fire.</p><p>\u201cIt will do me and my wife no good to have ye killed, Duncan. Mind what I say. If a ship comes\u2014go.\u201d He turned aside then, and went to take leave of the other Scots.</p><p>Innes sighed deeply, his face etched with disapproval, but he made no further protest.</p><p>It was hot and damp in the jungle, and there was little talk among the three of us as we made our way inland. There was nothing to say, after all; Jamie and I could not speak of Brianna before Lawrence, and there were no plans to be made until we reached Abandawe, and saw what was there. I dozed fitfully at night, waking several times to see Jamie, back against a tree near me, eyes fixed sightless on the fire.</p><p>At noon of the second day, we reached the place. A steep and rocky hillside of gray limestone rose before us, sprouted over with spiky aloes and a ruffle of coarse grass. And on the crest of the hill, I could see them. Great standing stones, megaliths, in a rough circle about the crown of the hill.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say there was a stone circle,\u201d I said. I felt faint, and not only from the heat and damp.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite well, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d Lawrence peered at me in some alarm, his genial face flushed beneath its tan.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, but my face must as usual have given me away, for Jamie was there in a moment, taking my arm and steadying me with a hand about my waist.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, be careful, Sassenach!\u201d he muttered. \u201cDinna go near those things!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to know if Geilie\u2019s there, with Ian,\u201d I said. \u201cCome on.\u201d I forced my reluctant feet into motion, and he came with me, still muttering under his breath in Gaelic\u2014I thought it was a prayer.</p><p>\u201cThey were put up a very long time ago,\u201d Lawrence said, as we came up onto the crest of the hill, within a few feet of the stones. \u201cNot by slaves\u2014by the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands.\u201d</p><p>The circle was empty, and innocent-looking. No more than a staggered circle of large stones, set on end, motionless under the sun. Jamie was watching my face anxiously.</p><p>\u201cCan ye hear them, Claire?\u201d he said. Lawrence looked startled, but said nothing as I advanced carefully toward the nearest stone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t one of the proper days\u2014not a Sun Feast, or a Fire Feast, I mean. It may not be open now; I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Holding tightly to Jamie\u2019s hand, I edged forward, listening. There seemed a faint hum in the air, but it might be no more than the usual sound of the jungle insects. Very gently, I laid the palm of my hand against the nearest stone.</p><p>I was dimly conscious of Jamie calling my name. Somewhere, my mind was struggling on a physical level, making the conscious effort to lift and lower my diaphragm, to squeeze and release the chambers of my heart. My ears were filled with a pulsating hum, a vibration too deep for sound, that throbbed in the marrow of my bones. And in some small, still place in the center of the chaos was Geilie Duncan, green eyes smiling into mine.</p><p>\u201cClaire!\u201d</p><p>I was lying on the ground, Jamie and Lawrence bending over me, faces dark and anxious against the sky. There was dampness on my cheeks, and a trickle of water ran down my neck. I blinked, cautiously moving my extremities, to be sure I still possessed them.</p><p>Jamie put down the handkerchief with which he had been bathing my face, and lifted me to a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, still mildly confused. \u201cJamie\u2014she\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Mrs. Abernathy?\u201d Lawrence\u2019s heavy eyebrows shot up, and he glanced hastily behind him, as though expecting her to materialize on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI heard her\u2014saw her\u2014whatever.\u201d My wits were coming slowly back. \u201cShe\u2019s here. Not in the circle; close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan ye tell where?\u201d Jamie\u2019s hand was resting on his dirk, as he darted quick glances all around us.</p><p>I shook my head, and closed my eyes, trying\u2014reluctantly\u2014to recapture that moment of seeing. There was an impression of darkness, of damp coolness, and the flicker of red torchlight.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s in a cave,\u201d I said, amazed. \u201cIs it close by, Lawrence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said, watching my face with intense curiosity. \u201cThe entrance is not far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake us there.\u201d Jamie was on his feet, lifting me to mine.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d I stopped him with a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2014she knows I\u2019m here, too.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him, all right. He paused, and I saw him swallow. Then his jaw tightened, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cA Mh\u00eccheal bheannaichte, d\u00econ sinn bho dheamhainnean,\u201d he said softly, and turned toward the edge of the hill. Blessed Michael, defend us from demons.</p><p>The blackness was absolute. I brought my hand to my face; felt my palm brush my nose; but saw nothing. It wasn\u2019t an empty blackness, though. The floor of the passage was uneven, with small sharp particles that crunched underfoot, and the walls in some places grew so close together that I wondered how Geilie had ever managed to squeeze through.</p><p>Even in the places where the passage grew wider, and the stone walls were too far away for my outstretched hands to brush against, I could feel them. It was like being in a dark room with another person\u2014someone who kept quite silent, but whose presence I could feel, never more than an arm\u2019s length away.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand was tight on my shoulder, and I could feel his presence behind me, a warm disturbance in the cool void of the cave.</p><p>\u201cAre we headed right?\u201d he asked, when I stopped for a moment to catch my breath. \u201cThere are passages to the sides; I feel them as we pass. How can ye tell where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear. Hear them. It. Don\u2019t you hear?\u201d It was a struggle to speak, to form coherent thoughts. The call here was different; not the beehive sound of Craigh na Dun, but a hum like the vibration of the air following the striking of a great bell. I could feel it ringing in the long bones of my arms, echoing through pectoral girdle and spine.</p><p>Jamie gripped my arm hard.</p><p>\u201cStay with me!\u201d he said. \u201cSassenach\u2014don\u2019t let it take ye; stay!\u201d</p><p>I reached blindly out and he caught me tight against his chest. The thump of his heart against my temple was louder than the hum.</p><p>\u201cJamie. Jamie, hold on to me.\u201d I had never been more frightened. \u201cDon\u2019t let me go. If it takes me\u2014Jamie, I can\u2019t come back again. It\u2019s worse every time. It will kill me, Jamie!\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened round me \u2019til I felt my ribs crack, and gasped for breath. After a moment, he let go, and putting me gently aside, moved past me into the passage, taking care to keep his hand always on me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d he said. \u201cPut your hand in my belt, and dinna let go for anything.\u201d</p><p>Linked together, we moved slowly down, farther into the dark. Lawrence had wanted to come, but Jamie would not let him. We had left him at the mouth of the cave, waiting. If we should not return, he was to go back to the beach, to keep the rendezvous with Innes and the other Scots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If we should not return...</p><p>He must have felt my grip tighten, for he stopped, and drew me alongside him.</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI must say something.\u201d</p><p>I knew already, and groped for his mouth to stop him, but my hand brushed by his face in the dark. He gripped my wrist, and held tight.</p> <p>\u201cIf it will be a choice between her and one of us\u2014then it must be me. Ye know that, aye?\u201d</p><p>I knew that. If Geilie should be there, still, and one of us might be killed in stopping her, it must be Jamie to take the risk. For with Jamie dead, I would be left\u2014and I could follow her through the stone, which he could not.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered at last. I knew also what he did not say, and what he knew as well; that should Geilie have gone through already, then I must go as well.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me, Claire,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd know that you are more to me than life, and I have no regret.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t answer, but kissed him, first his hand, its crooked fingers warm and firm, and the brawny wrist of a sword-wielder, and then his mouth, haven and promise and anguish all mingled, and the salt of tears in the taste of him.</p> <p>Then I let go, and turned toward the left-hand tunnel.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d I said. Within ten paces, I saw the light.</p><p>It was no more than a faint glow on the rocks of the passage, but it was enough to restore the gift of sight. Suddenly, I could see my hands and feet, though dimly. My breath came out in something like a sob, of relief and fear. I felt like a ghost taking shape as I walked toward the light and the soft bell-hum before me.</p><p>The light was stronger, now, then dimmed again as Jamie slid in front of me, and his back blocked my view. Then he bent and stepped through a low archway. I followed, and stood up in light.</p><p>It was a good-sized chamber, the walls farthest from the torch still cold and black with the slumber of the cave. The wall before us had wakened, though. It flickered and gleamed, particles of embedded mineral reflecting the flames of a pine torch, fixed in a crevice.</p><p>\u201cSo ye came, did you?\u201d Geillis was on her knees, eyes fixed on a glittering stream of white powder that fell from her folded fist, drawing a line on the dark floor.</p> <p>I heard a small sound from Jamie, half relief, half horror, as he saw Ian. The boy lay in the middle of the pentacle on his side, hands bound behind him, gagged with a strip of white cloth. Next to him lay an ax. It was made of a shiny dark stone, like obsidian, with a sharp, chipped edge. The handle was covered with gaudy beadwork, in an African pattern of stripes and zigzags.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer, fox.\u201d Geilie sat back on her heels, showing her teeth to Jamie in an expression that was not a smile. She held a pistol in one hand; its fellow, charged and cocked, was thrust through the leather belt she wore about her waist.</p><p>Eyes fixed on Jamie, she reached into the pouch suspended from the belt and withdrew another handful of diamond dust. I could see beads of sweat standing on her broad white brow; the bell-hum from the time-passage must be reaching her as it reached me. I felt sick, and the sweat ran down my body in trickles under my clothes.</p><p>The pattern was almost finished. With the pistol carefully trained, she dribbled out the thin, shining stream until she had completed the pentagram. The stones were already laid inside it\u2014they glinted from the floor in sparks of color, connected by a gleaming line of poured quicksilver.</p><p>\u201cThere, then.\u201d She sat back on her heels with a sigh of relief, and wiped the thick, creamy hair back with one hand. \u201cSafe. The diamond dust keeps out the noise,\u201d she explained to me. \u201cNasty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She patted Ian, who lay bound and gagged on the ground in front of her, his eyes wide with fear above the white cloth of the gag. \u201cThere, there, mo chridhe. Dinna fret, it will be soon over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your hand off him, ye wicked bitch!\u201d Jamie took an impulsive step forward, hand on his dirk, then stopped, as she lifted the barrel of the pistol an inch.</p><p>\u201cYe mind me o\u2019 your uncle Dougal, a sionnach,\u201d she said, tilting her head to one side coquettishly. \u201cHe was older when I met him than you are now, but you\u2019ve the look of him about ye, aye? Like ye\u2019d take what ye pleased and damn anyone who stands in your way.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie looked at Ian, curled on the floor, then up at Geilie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take what\u2019s mine,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cBut ye can\u2019t, now, can ye?\u201d she said, pleasantly. \u201cOne more step, and I kill ye dead. I spare ye now, only because Claire seems fond of ye.\u201d Her eyes shifted to me, standing in the shadows behind Jamie. She nodded to me.</p><p>\u201cA life for a life, sweet Claire. Ye tried to save me once, on Craigh na Dun; I saved you from the witch-trial at Cranesmuir. We\u2019re quits now, aye?\u201d</p><p>Geilie picked up a small bottle, uncorked it, and poured the contents carefully over Ian\u2019s clothes. The smell of brandy rose up, strong and heady, and the torch flared brighter as the fumes of alcohol reached it. Ian bucked and kicked, making a strained noise of protest, and she kicked him sharply in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cBe still!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it, Geilie,\u201d I said, knowing that words would do no good.</p><p>\u201cI have to,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m meant to. I\u2019m sorry I shall have to take the girl, but I\u2019ll leave ye the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat girl?\u201d Jamie\u2019s fists were clenched tight at his side, knuckles white even in the dim torchlight.</p><p>\u201cBrianna? That\u2019s the name, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She shook back her heavy hair, smoothing it out of her face. \u201cThe last of Lovat\u2019s line.\u201d She smiled at me. \u201cWhat luck ye should have come to see me, aye? I\u2019d never ha\u2019 kent it, otherwise. I thought they\u2019d all died out before 1900.\u201d</p><p>A thrill of horror shot through me. I could feel the same tremor run through Jamie as his muscles tightened.</p><p>It must have shown on his face. Geilie cried out sharply and leapt back. She fired as he lunged at her. His head snapped back, and his body twisted, hands still reaching for her throat. Then he fell, his body limp across the edge of the glittering pentagram. There was a strangled moan from Ian.</p><p>I felt rather than heard a sound rise in my throat. I didn\u2019t know what I had said, but Geilie turned her face in my direction, startled.</p><p>When Brianna was two, a car had carelessly sideswiped mine, hitting the back door next to where she was sitting. I slowed to a stop, checked briefly to see that she was unhurt, and then bounded out, headed for the other car, which had pulled over a little way ahead.</p><p>The other driver was a man in his thirties, quite large, and probably entirely self-assured in his dealings with the world. He looked over his shoulder, saw me coming, and hastily rolled up his window, shrinking back in his seat.</p><p>I had no consciousness of rage or any other emotion; I simply knew, with no shadow of doubt, that I could\u2014and would\u2014shatter the window with my hand, and drag the man out through it. He knew it, too.</p><p>I thought no further than that, and didn\u2019t have to; the arrival of a police car had recalled me to my normal state of mind, and then I started to shake. But the memory of the look on that man\u2019s face stayed with me.</p><p>Fire is a poor illuminator, but it would have taken total darkness to conceal that look on Geilie\u2019s face; the sudden realization of what was coming toward her.</p><p>She jerked the other pistol from her belt and swung it to bear on me; I saw the round hole of the muzzle clearly\u2014and didn\u2019t care. The roar of the discharge caromed through the cave, the echoes sending down showers of rocks and dirt, but by then I had seized the ax from the floor.</p><p>I noted quite clearly the leather binding, ornamented with a beaded pattern. It was red, with yellow zigzags and black dots. The dots echoed the shiny obsidian of the blade, and the red and yellow picked up the hues of the flaming torch behind her.</p><p>I heard a noise behind me, but didn\u2019t turn. Reflections of the fire burned red in the pupils of her eyes. The red thing, Jamie had called it. I gave myself to it, he had said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to give myself; it had taken me.</p><p>There was no fear, no rage, no doubt. Only the stroke of the swinging ax.</p><p>The shock of it echoed up my arm, and I let go, my fingers numbed. I stood quite still, not even moving when she staggered toward me.</p><p>Blood in firelight is black, not red.</p><p>She took one blind step forward and fell, all her muscles gone limp, making no attempt to save herself. The last I saw of her face was her eyes; set wide, beautiful as gemstones, a green water-clear and faceted with the knowledge of death.</p><p>Someone was speaking, but the words made no sense. The cleft in the rock buzzed loudly, filling my ears. The torch flickered, flaring sudden yellow in a draft; the beating of the dark angel\u2019s wings, I thought.</p><p>The sound came again, behind me.</p><p>I turned and saw Jamie. He had risen to his knees, swaying. Blood was pouring from his scalp, dyeing one side of his face red-black. The other side was white as a harlequin\u2019s mask.</p><p>Stop the bleeding, said some remnant of instinct in my brain, and I fumbled for a handkerchief. But by then he had crawled to where Ian lay, and was groping at the boy\u2019s bonds, jerking loose the leather straps, drops of his blood pattering on the lad\u2019s shirt. Ian squirmed to his feet, his face ghastly pale, and put out a hand to help his uncle.</p><p>Then Jamie\u2019s hand was on my arm. I looked up, numbly offering the cloth. He took it and wiped it roughly over his face, then jerked at my arm, pulling me toward the tunnel mouth. I stumbled and nearly fell, caught myself, and came back to the present.</p><p>\u201cCome!\u201d he was saying. \u201cCan ye not hear the wind? There is a storm coming, above.\u201d</p><p>Wind? I thought. In a cave? But he was right; the draft had not been my imagination; the faint exhalation from the crack near the entrance had changed to a steady, whining wind, almost a keening that rang in the narrow passage.</p><p>I turned to look over my shoulder, but Jamie grasped my arm hard and pushed me forward. My last sight of the cave was a blurred impression of jet and rubies, with a still white shape in the middle of the floor. Then the draft came in with a roar, and the torch went out.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d It was Young Ian\u2019s voice, filled with terror, somewhere close by. \u201cUncle Jamie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice came out of the darkness just in front of me, surprisingly calm, raised to be heard above the noise. \u201cHere, lad. Come here to me, Ian. Dinna be afraid; it\u2019s only the cave breathing.\u201d</p><p>It was the wrong thing to say. When he said it, I could feel the cold breath of the rock touch my neck, and the hairs there rose up prickling. The image of the cave as a living thing, breathing all around us, blind and malevolent, struck me cold with horror.</p><p>Apparently the notion was as terrifying to Ian as it was to me, for I heard a faint gasp, and then his groping hand struck me and clung for dear life to my arm.</p><p>I clutched his hand with one of mine and probed the dark ahead with the other, finding Jamie\u2019s reassuringly large shape almost at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got Ian,\u201d I said. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d</p><p>He gripped my hand in answer, and linked together, we began to make our way back down the winding tunnel, stumbling through the pitch dark and stepping on each other\u2019s heels. And all the time, that ghostly wind whined at our backs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could see nothing; no hint of Jamie\u2019s shirt in front of my face, snowy white as I knew it to be, not even a flicker of the movement of my own light-colored skirts, though I heard them swish about my feet as I walked, the sound blending with that of the wind.</p><p>The thin rush of air rose and fell in pitch, whispering and wailing. I tried to force my mind away from the memory of what lay behind us, away from the morbid fancy that the wind held sighing voices, whispering secrets just past hearing.</p><p>\u201cI can hear her,\u201d Ian said suddenly behind me. His voice rose, cracking with panic. \u201cI can hear her! God, oh God, she\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>I froze in my tracks, a scream wedged in my throat. The cool observer in my head knew quite well it was not so\u2014only the wind and Ian\u2019s fright\u2014but that made no difference to the spurt of sheer terror that rose from the pit of my stomach and turned my bowels to water. I knew she was coming, too, and screamed out loud.</p> <p>Then Jamie had me, and Ian too, gripped tight against him, one in each arm, our ears muffled against his chest. He smelled of pine smoke and sweat and brandy, and I nearly sobbed in relief at the closeness of him.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cHush, the both of ye! I willna let her touch ye. Never!\u201d He pressed us to him, hard; I felt his heart beating fast beneath my cheek and Ian\u2019s bony shoulder, squeezed against mine, and then the pressure relaxed.</p><p>\u201cCome along now,\u201d Jamie said, more quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s but wind. Caves blow through their cracks when the weather changes aboveground. I\u2019ve heard it before. There is a storm coming, outside. Come, now.\u201d</p><p>The storm was a brief one. By the time we had stumbled to the surface, blinking against the shock of sunlight, the rain had passed, leaving the world reborn in its wake.</p><p>Lawrence was sheltering under a dripping palm near the cave\u2019s entrance. When he saw us, he sprang to his feet, a look of relief relaxing the creases of his face.</p> <p>\u201cIt is all right?\u201d he said, looking from me to a blood-stained Jamie.</p><p>Jamie gave him half a smile, nodding.</p><p>\u201cIt is all right,\u201d he said. He turned and motioned to Ian. \u201cMay I present my nephew, Ian Murray? Ian, this is Dr. Stern, who\u2019s been of great assistance to us in looking for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much obliged to ye, Doctor,\u201d Ian said, with a bob of his head. He wiped a sleeve across his streaked face, and glanced at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI knew ye\u2019d come, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said, with a tremulous smile, \u201cbut ye left it a bit late, aye?\u201d The smile widened, then broke, and he began to tremble. He blinked hard, fighting back tears.</p><p>\u201cI did then, and I\u2019m sorry, Ian. Come here, a bhalaich.\u201d Jamie reached out and took him in a close embrace, patting his back and murmuring to him in Gaelic.</p> <p>I watched for a moment, before I realized that Lawrence was speaking to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite well, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d he was asking. Without waiting for an answer, he took my arm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite know.\u201d I felt completely empty. Exhausted as though by childbirth, but without the exultation of spirit. Nothing seemed quite real; Jamie, Ian, Lawrence, all seemed like toy figures that moved and talked at a distance, making noises that I had to strain to understand.</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps we should leave this place,\u201d Lawrence said, with a glance at the cave mouth from which we had just emerged. He looked slightly uneasy. He didn\u2019t ask about Mrs. Abernathy.</p><p>\u201cI think you are right.\u201d The picture of the cave we had left was vivid in my mind\u2014but just as unreal as the vivid green jungle and gray stones around us. Not waiting for the men to follow, I turned and walked away.</p><p>The feeling of remoteness increased as we walked. I felt like an automaton, built around an iron core, walking by clockwork. I followed Jamie\u2019s broad back through branches and clearings, shadow and sun, not noticing where we were going. Sweat ran down my sides and into my eyes, but I barely stirred to wipe it away. At length, toward sunset, we stopped in a small clearing near a stream, and made our primitive camp.</p><p>I had already discovered that Lawrence was a most useful person to have along on a camping trip. He was not only as good at finding or building shelter as was Jamie, but was sufficiently familiar with the flora and fauna of the area to be able to plunge into the jungle and return within half an hour bearing handfuls of edible roots, fungi, and fruit with which to augment the Spartan rations in our packs.</p><p>Ian was set to gather firewood while Lawrence foraged, and I sat Jamie down with a pan of water, to tend the damage to his head. I washed away the blood from face and hair, to find to my surprise that the ball had in fact not plowed a furrow through his scalp as I had thought. Instead, it had pierced the skin just above his hairline and\u2014evidently\u2014vanished into his head. There was no sign of an exit wound. Unnerved by this, I prodded his scalp with increasing agitation, until a sudden cry from the patient announced that I had discovered the bullet.</p> <p>There was a large, tender lump on the back of his head. The pistol ball had traveled under the skin, skimming the curve of his skull, and come to rest just over his occiput.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Christ!\u201d I exclaimed. I felt it again, unbelieving, but there it was. \u201cYou always said your head was solid bone, and I\u2019ll be damned if you weren\u2019t right. She shot you point-blank, and the bloody ball bounced off your skull!\u201d</p><p>Jamie, supporting his head in his hands as I examined him, made a sound somewhere between a snort and a groan.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, his voice somewhat muffled in his hands, \u201cI\u2019ll no say I\u2019m not thick-heided, but if Mistress Abernathy had used a full charge of powder, it wouldna have been nearly thick enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the wound, no, though it\u2019s sore. I\u2019ve a terrible headache, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder. Hold on a bit; I\u2019m going to take the ball out.\u201d</p><p>Not knowing in what condition we might find Ian, I had brought the smallest of my medical boxes, which fortunately contained a bottle of alcohol and a small scalpel. I shaved away a little of Jamie\u2019s abundant mane, just below the swelling, and soused the area with alcohol for disinfection. My fingers were chilled from the alcohol, but his head was warm and comfortingly live to the touch.</p><p>\u201cThree deep breaths and hold on tight,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019m going to cut you, but it will be fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d The back of his neck looked a little pale, but the pulse was steady. He obligingly drew in his breath deeply, and exhaled, sighing. I held the area of scalp taut between the index and third fingers of my left hand. On the third breath, I said, \u201cRight now,\u201d and drew the blade hard and quick across the scalp. He grunted slightly, but didn\u2019t cry out. I pressed gently with my right thumb against the swelling, slightly harder\u2014and the ball popped out of the incision I had made, falling into my left hand like a grape.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I said, and only then realized that I had been holding my breath. I dropped the little pellet\u2014somewhat flattened by its contact with his skull\u2014into his hand, and smiled, a little shakily. \u201cSouvenir,\u201d I said. I pressed a pad of cloth against the small wound, wound a strip of cloth round his head to hold it, and then quite suddenly, with no warning whatever, began to cry.</p><p>I could feel the tears rolling down my face, and my shoulders shaking, but I felt still detached; somehow outside my body. I was conscious mostly of a mild amazement.</p><p>\u201cSassenach? Are ye all right?\u201d Jamie was peering up at me, eyes worried under the rakish bandage.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, stuttering from the force of my crying. \u201cI d-don\u2019t k-know why I\u2019m c-crying. I d-don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He took my hand and drew me down onto his knee. He wrapped his arms around me and held me tight, resting his cheek on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s fine now, mo chridhe, it\u2019s fine.\u201d He rocked me gently, one hand stroking my hair and neck, and murmured small unimportant things in my ear. Just as suddenly as I had been detached, I was back inside my body, warm and shaking, feeling the iron core dissolve in my tears.</p><p>Gradually I stopped weeping, and lay still against his chest, hiccuping now and then, feeling nothing but peace and the comfort of his presence.</p><p>I was dimly aware that Lawrence and Ian had returned, but paid no attention to them. At one point, I heard Ian say, with more curiosity than alarm, \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding all down the back of your neck, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll fix me a new bandage, then, Ian,\u201d Jamie said. His voice was soft and unconcerned. \u201cI must just hold your auntie now.\u201d And sometime later I went to sleep, still held tight in the circle of his arms.</p><p>I woke up later, curled on a blanket next to Jamie. He was leaning against a tree, one hand resting on my shoulder. He felt me wake, and squeezed gently. It was dark, and I could hear a rhythmic snoring somewhere close at hand. It must be Lawrence, I thought drowsily, for I could hear Young Ian\u2019s voice, on the other side of Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he was saying slowly, \u201cit wasna really so bad, on the ship. We were all kept together, so there was company from the other lads, and they fed us decently, and let us out two at a time to walk about the deck. Of course, we were all scairt, for we\u2019d no notion why we\u2019d been taken\u2014and none of the sailors would tell us anything\u2014but we were not mistreated.\u201d</p><p>The Bruja had sailed up the Yallahs River, and delivered her human cargo directly to Rose Hall. Here the bewildered boys had been warmly welcomed by Mrs. Abernathy, and promptly popped into a new prison.</p><p>The basement beneath the sugar mill had been fitted up comfortably enough, with beds and chamber pots, and aside from the noise of the sugar-making above during the days, it was comfortable enough. Still, none of the boys could think why they were there, though any number of suggestions were made, each more improbable than the last.</p><p>\u201cAnd every now and then, a great black fellow would come down into the place with Mrs. Abernathy. We always begged to know what it was we were there for, and would she not be letting us go, for mercy\u2019s sake? but she only smiled and patted us and said we would see, in good time. Then she would choose a lad, and the black fellow would clamp onto the lad\u2019s arm and take him awa\u2019 wi\u2019 them.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice sounded distressed, and little wonder.</p><p>\u201cDid the lads come back again?\u201d Jamie asked. His hand patted me softly, and I reached up and pressed it.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014or not usually. And that scairt us all something dreadful.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s turn had come eight weeks after his arrival. Three lads had gone and not returned by then, and when Mistress Abernathy\u2019s bright green eyes rested on him, he was not disposed to cooperate.</p><p>\u201cI kicked the black fellow, and hit him\u2014I even bit his hand,\u201d Ian said ruefully, \u201cand verra nasty he tasted, too\u2014all over some kind of grease, he was. But it made nay difference; he only clouted me over the head, hard enough to make my ears ring, then picked me up and carried me off in his arms, as though I was no more than a wee bairn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian had been taken into the kitchen, where he was stripped, bathed, dressed in a clean shirt\u2014but nothing else\u2014and taken to the main house.</p><p>\u201cIt was just at night,\u201d he said wistfully, \u201cand all the windows lighted. It looked verra much like Lallybroch, when ye come down from the hills just at dark, and Mam\u2019s just lit the lamps\u2014it almost broke my heart to see it, and think of home.\u201d</p><p>He had had little opportunity to feel homesick, though. Hercules\u2014or Atlas\u2014had marched him up the stairs into what was obviously Mistress Abernathy\u2019s bedroom. Mrs. Abernathy was waiting for him, dressed in a soft, loose sort of gown with odd-looking figures embroidered round the hem of it in red and silver thread.</p><p>She had been cordial and welcoming, and had offered him a drink. It smelled strange, but not nasty, and as he had little choice in the matter, he had drunk it.</p> <p>There were two comfortable chairs in the room, on either side of a long, low table, and a great bed at one side, swagged and canopied like a king\u2019s. He had sat in one chair, Mrs. Abernathy in the other, and she had asked him questions.</p><p>\u201cWhat sorts of questions?\u201d Jamie asked, prompting as Ian seemed hesitant.</p><p>\u201cWell, all about my home, and my family\u2014she asked the names of all my sisters and brothers, and my aunts and uncles\u201d\u2014I jerked a bit. So that was why Geilie had betrayed no surprise at our appearance!\u2014\u201cand all sorts of things, Uncle. Then she\u2014she asked me had I\u2014had I ever lain wi\u2019 a lassie. Just as though she were asking did I have parritch to my breakfast!\u201d Ian sounded shocked at the memory.</p><p>\u201cI didna want to answer her, but I couldna seem to help myself. I felt verra warm, like I was fevered, and I couldna seem to move easy. But I answered all her questions, and her just sitting there, pleasant as might be, watching me close wi\u2019 those big green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ye told her the truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. Aye, I did.\u201d Ian spoke slowly, reliving the scene. \u201cI said I had, and I told her about\u2014about Edinburgh, and the printshop, and the seaman, and the brothel, and Mary, and\u2014everything.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Geilie had seemed displeased with one of his answers. Her face had grown hard and her eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Ian was seriously afraid. He would have run, then, but for the heaviness in his limbs, and the presence of the giant who stood against the door, unmoving.</p><p>\u201cShe got up and stamped about a bit, and said I was ruined, then, as I wasna a virgin, and what business did a bittie wee lad like me have, to be goin\u2019 wi\u2019 the lassies and spoiling myself?\u201d</p><p>Then she had stopped her ranting, poured a glass of wine and drank it off, and her temper had seemed to cool.</p><p>\u201cShe laughed then, and looked at me careful, and said as how I might not be such a loss, after all. If I was no good for what she had in mind, perhaps I might have other uses.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice sounded faintly constricted, as though his collar were too tight. Jamie made a soothing interrogatory sound, though, and he took a deep breath, determined to go on.</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2014she took my hand and made me stand up. Then she took off the shirt I was wearing, and she\u2014I swear it\u2019s true, Uncle!\u2014she knelt on the floor in front of me, and took my c**k into her mouth!\u201d</p> <p>Jamie\u2019s hand tightened on my shoulder, but his voice betrayed no more than a mild interest.</p><p>\u201cAye, I believe ye, Ian. She made love to ye, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d Ian sounded dazed. \u201cNo\u2014I mean, I dinna ken. It\u2014she\u2014well, she got my c**k to stand up, and then she made me come to the bed and lie down and she did things. But it wasna at all like it was with wee Mary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I shouldna suppose it was,\u201d his uncle said dryly.</p><p>\u201cGod, it felt queer!\u201d I could sense Ian\u2019s shudder from the tone of his voice. \u201cI looked up in the middle, and there was the black man, standing right by the bed, holding a candlestick. She told him to lift it higher, so that she could see better.\u201d He paused, and I heard a small glugging noise as he drank from one of the bottles. He let out a long, quivering breath.</p><p>\u201cUncle. Have ye ever\u2014lain wi\u2019 a woman, when ye didna want to do it?\u201d</p><p>Jamie hesitated a moment, his hand tight on my shoulder, but then he said quietly, \u201cAye, Ian. I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The boy was quiet, and I heard him scratch his head. \u201cD\u2019ye ken how it can be, Uncle? How ye can do it, and not want to a bit, and hate doing it, and\u2014and still it\u2014it feels good?\u201d</p> <p>Jamie gave a small, dry laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, what it comes to, Ian, is that your c**k hasna got a conscience, and you have.\u201d His hand left my shoulder as he turned toward his nephew. \u201cDinna trouble yourself, Ian,\u201d he said. \u201cYe couldna help it, and it\u2019s likely that it saved your life for ye. The other lads\u2014the ones who didna come back to the cellar\u2014d\u2019ye ken if they were virgins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014a few I know were for sure\u2014for we had a great deal of time to talk, aye? and after a time we kent a lot about one another. Some o\u2019 the lads boasted of havin\u2019 gone wi\u2019 a lassie, but I thought\u2014from what they said about it, ye ken\u2014that they hadna done it, really.\u201d He paused for a moment, as though reluctant to ask what he knew he must.</p><p>\u201cUncle\u2014d\u2019ye ken what happened to them? The rest of the lads with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ian,\u201d Jamie said, evenly. \u201cI\u2019ve no notion.\u201d He leaned back against the tree, sighing deeply. \u201cD\u2019ye think ye can sleep, wee Ian? If ye can, ye should, for it will be a weary walk to the shore tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can sleep, Uncle,\u201d Ian assured him. \u201cBut should I not keep watch? It\u2019s you should be resting, after bein\u2019 shot and all that.\u201d He paused and then added, rather shyly, \u201cI didna say thank ye, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Jamie laughed, freely this time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re verra welcome, Ian,\u201d he said, the smile still in his voice. \u201cLay your head and sleep, laddie. I\u2019ll wake ye if there\u2019s need.\u201d</p><p>Ian obligingly curled up and within moments, was breathing heavily. Jamie sighed and leaned back against the tree.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sleep too, Jamie?\u201d I pushed myself up to sit beside him. \u201cI\u2019m awake; I can keep an eye out.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed, the dying firelight dancing on the lids. He smiled without opening them and groped for my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo. If ye dinna mind sitting with me for a bit, though, you can watch. The headache\u2019s better if I close my eyes.\u201d</p><p>We sat in contented silence for some time, hand in hand. An occasional odd noise or far-off scream from some jungle animal came from the dark, but nothing seemed threatening now.</p><p>\u201cWill we go back to Jamaica?\u201d I asked at last. \u201cFor Fergus and Marsali?\u201d</p><p>Jamie started to shake his head, then stopped, with a stifled groan.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we shall sail for Eleuthera. That\u2019s Dutch-owned, and neutral. We can send Innes back wi\u2019 John\u2019s boatie, and he can take a message to Fergus to come and join us. I would as soon not set foot on Jamaica again, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d I was quiet for a moment, then said, \u201cI wonder how Mr. Willoughby\u2014Yi Tien Cho, I mean\u2014will manage. I don\u2019t suppose anyone will find him, if he stays in the mountains, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he may manage brawly,\u201d Jamie interrupted. \u201cHe\u2019s the pelican to fish for him, after all.\u201d One side of his mouth turned up in a smile. \u201cFor that matter, if he\u2019s canny, he\u2019ll find a way south, to Martinique. There\u2019s a small colony there of Chinese traders. I\u2019d told him of it; said I\u2019d take him there, once our business on Jamaica was finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t angry at him now?\u201d I looked at him curiously, but his face was smooth and peaceful, almost unlined in the firelight.</p><p>This time he was careful not to move his head, but lifted one shoulder in a shrug, and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cOch, no.\u201d He sighed and settled himself more comfortably. \u201cI dinna suppose he had much thought for what he did, or understood at all what might be the end of it. And it would be foolish to hate a man for not giving ye something he hasna got in the first place.\u201d He opened his eyes then, with a faint smile, and I knew he was thinking of John Grey.</p><p>Ian twitched in his sleep, snorted loudly, and rolled over onto his back, arms flung wide. Jamie glanced at his nephew, and the smile grew wider.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said. \u201cHe goes back to his mother by the first ship headed for Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cHe might not want to go back to Lallybroch, after all this adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna care whether he wants to or not,\u201d Jamie said firmly. \u201cHe\u2019s going, if I must pack him up in a crate. Are ye looking for something, Sassenach?\u201d he added, seeing me groping in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d I said, pulling the flat hypodermic case out of my pocket. I flipped it open to check the contents, squinting to see by the waning light. \u201cOh, good; there\u2019s enough left for one whopping dose.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sat up a little straighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fevered a bit,\u201d he said, eyeing me warily. \u201cAnd if ye have it in mind to shove that filthy spike into my head, ye can just think again, Sassenach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d I said. \u201cIan. Unless you mean to send him home to Jenny riddled with syphilis and other interesting forms of the clap.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyebrows rose toward his hairline, and he winced at the resultant sensation.</p><p>\u201cOw. Syphilis? Ye think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be a bit surprised. Pronounced dementia is one of the symptoms of the advanced disease\u2014though I must say it would be hard to tell in her case. Still, better safe than sorry, hm?\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted briefly with amusement.</p><p>\u201cWell, that may teach Young Ian the price o\u2019 dalliance. I\u2019d best distract Stern while ye take the lad behind a bush for his penance, though; Lawrence is a bonny man for a Jew, but he\u2019s curious. I dinna want ye burnt at the stake in Kingston, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect that would be awkward for the Governor,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cMuch as he might enjoy it, personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldna think he would, Sassenach.\u201d His dryness matched my own. \u201cIs my coat within reach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I found the garment folded on the ground near me, and handed it to him. \u201cAre you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He leaned back, the coat laid across his knees. \u201cIt\u2019s only that I wanted to feel the bairns all close to me while I sleep.\u201d He smiled at me, folded his hands gently atop the coat and its pictures, and closed his eyes again. \u201cGood night, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>63</p><p>OUT OF THE DEPTHS</p><p>In the morning, buoyed by rest and a breakfast of biscuit and plantain, we pressed on toward the shore in good heart\u2014even Ian, who ceased to limp ostentatiously after the first quarter-mile. As we came down the defile that led onto the beach, though, a remarkable sight met our eyes.</p><p>\u201cJesus God, it\u2019s them!\u201d Ian blurted. \u201cThe pirates!\u201d He turned, ready to flee back into the hills, but Jamie grasped him by the arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot pirates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the slaves. Look!\u201d</p><p>Unskilled in the seamanship of large vessels, the escaped slaves of the Yallahs River plantations had evidently made a slow and blundering passage toward Hispaniola, and having somehow arrived at that island, had promptly run the ship aground. The Bruja lay canted on her side in the shallows, her keel sunk deep in the sandy mud. A very agitated group of slaves surrounded her, some rushing up and down the beach shouting, others dashing off toward the refuge of the jungle, a few remaining to help the last of their number off the beached hulk.</p><p>A quick glance out to sea showed the cause of their agitation. A patch of white showed on the horizon, growing in size even as we watched.</p><p>\u201cA man-of-war,\u201d Lawrence said, sounding interested.</p> <p>Jamie said something under his breath in Gaelic, and Ian glanced at him, shocked.</p><p>\u201cOut of here,\u201d Jamie said tersely. He pulled Ian about and gave him a shove up the defile, then grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d said Lawrence, shading his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s another ship coming. A little one.\u201d</p><p>The Governor of Jamaica\u2019s private pinnace, to be exact, leaning at a perilous angle as she shot round the curve of the bay, her canvas bellied by the wind on her quarter.</p><p>Jamie stood for a split second, weighing the possibilities, then grabbed my hand again.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d he said.</p><p>By the time we reached the edge of the beach, the pinnace\u2019s small boat was plowing through the shallows, Raeburn and MacLeod pulling hard at the oars. I was wheezing and gulping air, my knees rubbery from the run. Jamie snatched me up bodily into his arms and ran into the surf, followed by Lawrence and Ian, gasping like whales.</p><p>I saw Gordon, a hundred yards out in the pinnace\u2019s bow, aim a gun at the shore, and knew we were followed. The musket discharged with a puff of smoke, and Meldrum, behind him, promptly raised his own weapon and fired. Taking it in turns, the two of them covered our splashing advance, until friendly hands could pull us over the side and raise the boat.</p><p>\u201cCome about!\u201d Innes, manning the wheel, barked the order, and the boom swung across, the sails filling at once. Jamie hauled me to my feet and deposited me on a bench, then flung himself down beside me, panting.</p><p>\u201cHoly God,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cDid I no\u2014tell ye to\u2014stay away\u2014Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave your breath, Mac Dubh,\u201d Innes said, a wide grin spreading under his mustache. \u201cYe havena enough to be wasting it.\u201d He shouted something to MacLeod, who nodded and did something to the lines. The pinnace heeled over, changed her course, and came about, headed straight out of the tiny cove\u2014and straight toward the man-of-war, now close enough for me to see the fat-lipped porpoise grinning beneath its bowsprit.</p> <p>MacLeod bellowed something in Gaelic, accompanied by a gesture that left the meaning of what he had said in no doubt. To a triumphant yodel from Innes, we shot past the Porpoise, directly under her bow and close enough to see surprised-looking heads poking out from the rail above.</p><p>I looked back as we left the cove, to see the Porpoise still heading in, massive under her three great masts. The pinnace could never outrace her on the open sea, but in close quarters, the little sloop was light and maneuverable as a feather by comparison to the leviathan man-of-war.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the slave ship they\u2019ll be after,\u201d Meldrum said, turning to look alongside me. \u201cWe saw the man-o\u2019-war pick her up, three miles off the island. We thought whilst they were otherwise occupied, we might as well nip in and pick ye all off the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d Jamie said with a smile. His chest was still heaving, but he had recovered his breath. \u201cI hope the Porpoise will be sufficiently occupied for the time being.\u201d</p><p>A warning shout from Raeburn indicated that this was not to be, however. Looking back, I could see the gleam of brass on the Porpoise\u2019s deck as the pair of long guns called stern chasers were uncovered and began their process of aiming.</p><p>Now it was us at gunpoint, and I found the sensation very objectionable. Still, we were moving, and fast, at that. Innes put the wheel hard over, then hard again, tacking a zigzag path past the headland.</p><p>The stern chasers boomed together. There was a splash off the port bow, twenty yards away, but a good deal too close for comfort, given the fact that a twenty-four pound ball through the floor of the pinnace would sink us like a rock.</p><p>Innes cursed and hunched his shoulders over the wheel, his missing arm giving him an odd, lopsided appearance. Our course became still more erratic, and the next three tries came nowhere near. Then came a louder boom, and I looked back to see the side of the canted Bruja erupt in splinters, as the Porpoise came in range and trained her forward guns on the grounded ship.</p> <p>A rain of grapeshot hit the beach, striking dead in the center of a group of fleeing slaves. Bodies\u2014and parts of bodies\u2014flew into the air like black stick-figures and fell to the sand, staining it with red blotches. Severed limbs were scattered over the beach like driftwood.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mary, Mother of God.\u201d Ian, white to the lips, crossed himself, staring in horror at the beach as the shelling went on. Two more shots struck the Bruja, opening up a great hole in her side. Several landed harmlessly in the sand, and two more found their mark among the fleeing people. Then we were round the edge of the headland, and heading into the open sea, the beach and its carnage lost to view.</p><p>\u201cPray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\u201d Ian finished his prayer in a whisper, and crossed himself again.</p><p>There was little conversation in the boat, beyond Jamie\u2019s giving Innes instructions for Eleuthera, and a conference between Innes and MacLeod as to the proper heading. The rest of us were too appalled by what we had just seen\u2014and too relieved at our own escape\u2014to want to talk.</p><p>The weather was fair, with a bright, brisk breeze, and we made good way. By sundown, the island of Hispaniola had dropped below the horizon, and Grand Turk Island was rising to the left.</p><p>I ate my small share of the available biscuit, drank a cup of water, and curled myself in the bottom of the boat, lying down between Ian and Jamie to sleep. Innes, yawning, took his own rest in the bow, while MacLeod and Meldrum took it in turns to man the helm through the night.</p><p>A shout woke me in the morning. I rose on one elbow, blinking with sleep and stiff from a night spent on bare, damp boards. Jamie was standing by me, his hair blowing back in the morning breeze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked Jamie. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna believe it,\u201d he said, staring aft over the rail. \u201cIt\u2019s that bloody boat again!\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, to find that it was true; far astern were tiny white sails.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I said, squinting. \u201cCan you tell at this distance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, no,\u201d Jamie said frankly, \u201cbut Innes and MacLeod can, and they say it\u2019s the bloodsucking English, right enough. They\u2019ll have guessed our heading, maybe, and come after us, as soon as they\u2019d dealt with those poor black buggers on Hispaniola.\u201d He turned away from the rail, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cDamned little to be done about it, save to hope we stay ahead of them. Innes says there\u2019s a hope of giving them the slip off Cat Island, if we reach there by dark.\u201d</p><p>As the day wore on, we kept just out of firing distance, but Innes looked more and more worried.</p><p>The sea between Cat Island and Eleuthera was shallow, and filled with coral heads. A man-of-war could never follow us into the maze\u2014but neither could we move swiftly enough through it to avoid being sunk by the Porpoise\u2019s long guns. Once in those treacherous shoals and channels, we would be sitting ducks.</p><p>At last, reluctantly, the decision was made to head east, out to sea; we could not risk slowing, and there was a slight chance of giving the man-of-war the slip in the dark.</p><p>When dawn came, all sight of land had disappeared. The Porpoise, unfortunately, had not. She was no closer, but as the wind rose along with the sun, she shook out more sail, and began to gain. With every scrap of sail already hoisted, and nowhere to hide, there was nothing we could do but run\u2014and wait.</p><p>All through the long hours of the morning, the Porpoise grew steadily larger astern. The sky had begun to cloud over, and the wind had risen considerably, but this helped the Porpoise, with her huge spread of canvas, a great deal more than it did us.</p><p>By ten o\u2019clock, she was close enough to risk a shot. It fell far astern, but was frightening, nonetheless. Innes squinted back over his shoulder, judging the distance, then shook his head and settled grimly to his course. There was nothing to be gained by tacking now; we must head straight on, as long as we could, taking evasive action only when it was too late for anything else.</p><p>By eleven, the Porpoise had drawn within a quarter-mile, and the monotonous boom of her forward guns had begun to sound every ten minutes, as her gunner tried the range. If I closed my eyes, I could imagine Erik Johansen, bent sweating and powder-stained over his gun, the smoking slow-match in his hand. I hoped that Annekje had been left on Antigua with her goats.</p><p>By eleven-thirty, it had begun to rain, and a heavy sea was running. A sudden gust of wind struck us sideways, and the boat heeled over far enough to bring the port rail within a foot of the water. Dumped onto the deck by the motion, we disentangled ourselves as Innes and MacLeod skillfully righted the pinnace. I glanced back, as I did every few minutes, despite myself, and saw the seamen scampering aloft in the Porpoise, reefing the topsails.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s luck!\u201d MacGregor shouted in my ear, nodding where I was looking. \u201cThat\u2019ll slow them.\u201d</p><p>By twelve-thirty, the sky had gone a peculiar purple-green, and the wind had risen to an eerie whine. The Porpoise had taken in yet more canvas, and in spite of the action, had had a staysail carried away, the scrap of canvas jerked from the mast and whipped away, flapping like an albatross. She had long since stopped firing on us, unable to aim at such a small target in the heavy swell.</p><p>With the sun gone from sight, I could no longer estimate time. The storm caught us squarely, perhaps an hour later. There was no possibility of hearing anything; by sign language and grimaces, Innes made the men lower the sails; to keep canvas flying, or even reefed, was to risk having the mast ripped from the floorboards.</p><p>I clung tight to the rail with one hand, to Ian\u2019s hand with the other. Jamie crouched behind us, arms spread to give us the shelter of his back. The rain lashed past, hard enough to sting the skin, driven almost horizontal by the wind, and so thick that I barely saw the faint shape on the horizon that I thought was Eleuthera.</p><p>The sea had risen to terrifying heights, with swells rolling forty feet high. The pinnace rode them lightly, carried up and up and up to dizzy heights, then dropped abruptly into a trough. Jamie\u2019s face was dead white in the storm-light, his sodden hair pasted against his scalp.</p><p>It was near dark that it happened. The sky was nearly black, but there was an eerie green glow all across the horizon that silhouetted the skeletal shape of the Porpoise behind us. Another of the rain squalls slammed us sideways, lurching and swaying atop a huge wave.</p><p>As we picked ourselves up from yet another bruising spill, Jamie grabbed my arm, and pointed behind us. The Porpoise\u2019s foremast was oddly bent, the top of it leaning far to one side. Before I had time to realize what was happening, the top fifteen feet of the mast had split off and pitched into the sea, carrying with it rigging and spars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man-of-war swung heavily round this impromptu anchor, and came sliding sideways down the face of a wave. The wall of water towered over the ship, and came crashing down, catching her broadside. The Porpoise heeled, spun around once. The next wave rose, and took her stern first, pulling the high aft deck below the water, whipping the masts through the air like snapping twigs.</p><p>It took three more waves to sink her; no time for escape for her hapless crew, but plenty for those of us watching to share their terror. There was a great bubbling flurry in the trough of a wave, and the man-of-war was gone.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s arm was rigid as iron beneath my hand. All the men stared back, faces gone empty with horror. All save Innes, who crouched doggedly over the wheel, meeting each wave as it came.</p><p>A new wave rose up beside the rail and seemed to hover there, looming above me. The great wall of water was glassy clear; I could see suspended in it the debris and the men of the wrecked Porpoise, limbs outflung in grotesque ballet. The body of Thomas Leonard hung no more than ten feet from me, drowned mouth open in surprise, his long soft hair aswirl above the gilded collar of his coat.</p> <p>Then the wave struck. I was snatched off the deck, and at once engulfed in chaos. Blind and deaf, unable to breathe, I was tumbled through space, my arms and legs wrenched awry by the force of the water.</p><p>Everything was dark; there was nothing but sensation, and all of that intense but indistinguishable. Pressure and noise and overwhelming cold. I couldn\u2019t feel the pull of my clothing, or the jerk of the rope\u2014if it was still there\u2014around my waist. A sudden faint warmth swathed my legs, distinct in the surrounding cold as a cloud in a clear sky. Urine, I thought, but didn\u2019t know whether it was my own, or the last touch of another human body, swallowed as I was in the belly of the wave.</p><p>My head hit something with a sickening crack, and suddenly I was coughing my lungs out on the deck of the pinnace, still miraculously afloat. I sat up slowly, choking and wheezing. My rope was still in place, yanked so tight about my waist that I was sure my lower ribs were broken. I jerked feebly at it, trying to breathe, and then Jamie was there, one arm around me, the other groping at his belt for a knife.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right?\u201d he bellowed, his voice barely audible above the shrieking wind.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I tried to shout back, but it came out as no more than a wheeze. I shook my head, fumbling at my waist.</p> <p>The sky was a queer purple-green, a color I had never seen before. Jamie sawed at the rope, his bent head spray-soaked and the color of mahogany, hair whipped across his face by the fury of the wind.</p><p>The rope popped and I gulped in air, ignoring a stabbing pain in my side and the stinging of raw skin about my waist. The ship was pitching wildly, the deck swinging up and down like a lawn glider. Jamie fell down on the deck, pulling me with him, and began to work his way on hands and knees toward the mast, some six feet away, dragging me.</p><p>My garments had been drenched through, plastered to me from my immersion in the wave. Now the blast of the wind was so great that it plucked my skirts away from my legs and flung them up, half-dried, to beat about my face like goose wings.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s arm was tight as an iron bar across my chest. I clung to him, trying to aid our progress by shoving with my feet on the slippery deckboards. Smaller waves washed over the rail, sousing us intermittently, but no more huge monsters followed them.</p><p>Reaching hands grasped us and hauled us the last few feet, into the nominal shelter of the mast. Innes had tied the wheel over long since; as I looked forward, I saw lightning strike the sea ahead, making the spokes of the wheel spring out black, leaving an image like a spider\u2019s web printed on my retina.</p><p>Speech was impossible\u2014and unnecessary. Raeburn, Ian, Meldrum, and Lawrence were huddled against the mast, all tied; frightful as it was on deck, no one wanted to go below, to be tossed to and fro in bruising darkness, with no notion of what was happening overhead.</p> <p>I was sitting on the deck, legs splayed, with the mast at my back and the line passed across my chest. The sky had gone lead-gray on one side, a deep, lucent green on the other, and lightning was striking at random over the surface of the sea, bright jags of brilliance across the dark. The wind was so loud that even the thunderclaps reached us only now and then, as muffled booms, like ships\u2019 guns firing at a distance.</p><p>Then a bolt crashed down beside the ship, lightning and thunder together, close enough to hear the hiss of boiling water in the ringing aftermath of the thunderclap. The sharp reek of ozone flooded the air. Innes turned from the light, his tall, thin figure so sharply cut against the flash that he looked momentarily like a skeleton, black bones against the sky.</p><p>The momentary dazzle and his movement made it seem for an instant that he stood whole once more, two arms swinging, as though his missing limb had emerged from the ghost world to join him, here on the brink of eternity.</p><p>Oh, de headbone connected to de...neckbone. Joe Abernathy\u2019s voice sang softly in memory. And de neckbone connected to de...backbone... I had a sudden hideous vision of the scattered limbs I had seen on the beach by the corpse of the Bruja, animated by the lightning, squirming and wriggling to reunite.</p><p>Dem bones, dem bones, are gonna walk around.</p><p>Now, hear de word of de Lawd!</p><p>Another clap of thunder and I screamed, not at the sound, but at the lightning bolt of memory. A skull in my hands, with empty eyes that had once been the green of the hurricane sky.</p><p>Jamie shouted something in my ear, but I couldn\u2019t hear him. I could only shake my head in speechless shock, my skin rippling with horror.</p> <p>My hair, like my skirts, was drying in the wind; the strands of it danced on my head, pulling at the roots. As it dried, I felt the crackle of static electricity where my hair brushed my cheek. There was a sudden movement among the sailors around me and I looked up, to see the spars and rigging above coated in the blue phosphorescence of St. Elmo\u2019s fire.</p><p>A fireball dropped to the deck and rolled toward us, streaming phosphorescence. Jamie struck at it and it hopped delicately into the air and rolled away along the rail, leaving a scent of burning in its wake.</p><p>I looked up at Jamie to see if he was all right, and saw the loose ends of his hair standing out from his head, coated with fire and streaming backward like a demon\u2019s. Streaks of vivid blue outlined the fingers of his hand when he brushed the hair from his face. Then he looked down, saw me, and grasped my hand. A jolt of electricity shot through us both with the touch, but he didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say how long it lasted; hours or days. Our mouths dried from the wind, and grew sticky with thirst. The sky went from gray to black, but there was no telling whether it was night, or only the coming of rain.</p><p>The rain, when it did come, was welcome. It came with the drenching roar of a tropical shower, a drumming audible even above the wind. Better yet, it was hail, not rain; the hailstones hit my skull like pebbles, but I didn\u2019t care. I gathered the icy globules in both hands, and swallowed them half-melted, a cool benison to my tortured throat.</p><p>Meldrum and MacLeod crawled about the deck on hands and knees, scooping the hailstones into buckets and pots, anything that would hold water.</p><p>I slept intermittently, head lolling on Jamie\u2019s shoulder, and woke to find the wind still screaming. Numb to terror now, I only waited. Whether we lived or died seemed of little consequence, if only the dreadful noise would stop.</p><p>There was no telling day from night, no way to keep time, while the sun hid its face. The darkness seemed a little lighter now and then, but whether it was by virtue of daylight or moonlight, I couldn\u2019t tell. I slept, and woke, and slept again.</p><p>Then I woke, to find the wind a little quieter. The seas still heaved, and the tiny boat pitched like a cockleshell, throwing us up and dropping us with stomach-churning regularity. But the noise was less; I could hear, when MacGregor shouted to Ian to pass a cup of water. The men\u2019s faces were chapped and raw, their lips cracked to bleeding by the whistling wind, but they were smiling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone by.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice was low and husky in my ear, rusted by weather. \u201cThe storm\u2019s past.\u201d</p><p>It was; there were breaks in the lead-gray sky, and small flashes of a pale, fresh blue. I thought it must be early morning, sometime just past dawn, but couldn\u2019t tell for sure.</p><p>While the hurricane had ceased to blow, there was still a strong wind, and the storm surge carried us at an amazing speed. Meldrum took the wheel from Innes, and bending to check the compass, gave a cry of surprise. The fireball that had come aboard during the storm had harmed no one, but the compass was now a melted mass of silver metal, the wooden casing around it untouched.</p><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d said Lawrence, touching it reverently with one finger.</p><p>\u201cAye, and inconvenient, forbye,\u201d said Innes dryly. He looked upward, toward the ragged remnants of the dashing clouds. \u201cMuch of a hand at celestial navigation, are ye, Mr. Stern?\u201d</p><p>After much squinting at the rising sun and the remnants of the morning stars, Jamie, Innes, and Stern determined that our heading was roughly northeast.</p><p>\u201cWe must turn to the west,\u201d Stern said, leaning over the crude chart with Jamie and Innes. \u201cWe do not know where we are, but any land must surely be to the west.\u201d</p><p>Innes nodded, peering soberly at the chart, which showed a sprinkle of islands like coarse-ground pepper, floating on the waters of the Caribbean.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been headed out to sea for God knows how long. The hull\u2019s in one piece, but that\u2019s all I\u2019d say for it. As for the mast and sails\u2014well, they\u2019ll maybe hold for a time.\u201d He sounded dubious in the extreme. \u201cGod knows where we may fetch up, though.\u201d</p><p>Jamie grinned at him, dabbing at a trickle of blood from his cracked lip.</p><p>\u201cSo long as it\u2019s land, Duncan, I\u2019m no verra choosy about where.\u201d</p><p>Innes quirked an eyebrow at him, a slight smile on his lips.</p><p>\u201cAye? And here I thought ye\u2019d settled for sure on a sailor\u2019s life, Mac Dubh; ye\u2019re sae canty on deck. Why, ye havena puked once in the last twa days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I havena eaten anything in the last twa days,\u201d Jamie said wryly. \u201cI dinna much care if the island we find first is English, French, Spanish, or Dutch, but I should be obliged if ye\u2019d find one with food, Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Innes wiped a hand across his mouth and swallowed painfully; the mention of food made everyone salivate, despite dry mouths.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Mac Dubh,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cLand! It\u2019s land!\u201d The call came at last, five days later, in a voice rendered so hoarse by wind and thirst that it was no more than a faint croak, but full of joy, nonetheless. I dashed up on deck to see, my feet slipping on the ladder rungs. Everyone was hanging over the rail, looking at the humped black shape on the horizon. It was far off, but undeniably land, solid and distinct.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think we are?\u201d I tried to say, but my voice was so hoarse, the words came out in a tiny whisper, and no one heard. It didn\u2019t matter; if we were headed straight for the naval barracks at Antigua, I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The waves were running in huge, smooth swells, like the backs of whales. The wind was gusting now, and Innes called for the helmsman to bring the bow another point nearer the wind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could see a line of large birds flying, a stately procession skimming down the distant shoreline. Pelicans, searching the shallows for fish, with the sun gleaming on their wings.</p><p>I tugged at Jamie\u2019s sleeve and pointed at them.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d I began, but got no further. There was a sharp crack! and the world exploded in black and fire. I came to in the water. Dazed and half-choked, I floundered and fought in a world of dark green. Something was wrapped about my legs, dragging me down.</p><p>I flailed wildly, kicking to free my leg of the deadly grip. Something floated past my head, and I grabbed for it. Wood, blessed wood, something to hold onto in the surging waves.</p> <p>A dark shape sleeked by like a seal beneath the water, and a red head bobbed up six feet away, gasping.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d Jamie said. He reached me with two strokes, and ducking under the piece of wood I held, dived down. I felt a tugging at my leg, a sharp pain, and then the dragging tension eased. Jamie\u2019s head popped up again, across the spar. He grasped my wrists and hung there, gulping air, as the rolling swell carried us, up and down.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t see the ship anywhere; had it sunk? A wave broke over my head, and Jamie disappeared temporarily. I shook my head, blinking, and he was there again. He smiled at me, a savage grin of effort, and his grip on my wrists tightened harder.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d he rasped again, and I did. The wood was harsh and splintery under my hands, but I clung for all I was worth. We drifted, half-blinded by spray, spinning like a bit of flotsam, so that sometimes I saw the distant shore, sometimes nothing but the open sea from which we had come. And when the waves washed over us, I saw nothing but water.</p><p>There was something wrong with my leg; a strange numbness, punctuated with flashes of sharp pain. The vision of Murphy\u2019s peg and the razor-grin of an openmouthed shark drifted through my mind; had my leg been taken by some toothy beast? I thought of my tiny hoard of warm blood, streaming from the stump of a bitten limb, draining away into the cold vastness of the sea, and I panicked, trying to snatch my hand from Jamie\u2019s grasp in order to reach down and see for myself.</p> <p>He snarled something unintelligible at me and held on to my wrists like grim death. After a moment of frenzied thrashing, reason returned, and I calmed myself, thinking that if my leg were indeed gone, I would have lost consciousness by now.</p><p>At that, I was beginning to lose consciousness. My vision was growing gray at the edges, and floating bright spots covered Jamie\u2019s face. Was I really bleeding to death, or was it only cold and shock? It hardly seemed to matter, I thought muzzily; the effect was the same.</p><p>A sense of lassitude and utter peace stole gradually over me. I couldn\u2019t feel my feet or legs, and only Jamie\u2019s crushing grip on my hands reminded me of their existence. My head went under water, and I had to remind myself to hold my breath.</p><p>The wave subsided and the wood rose slightly, bringing my nose above water. I breathed, and my vision cleared slightly. A foot away was the face of Jamie Fraser, hair plastered to his head, wet features contorted against the spray.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d he roared. \u201cHold on, God damn you!\u201d</p><p>I smiled gently, barely hearing him. The sense of great peace was lifting me, carrying me beyond the noise and chaos. There was no more pain. Nothing mattered. Another wave washed over me, and this time I forgot to hold my breath.</p> <p>The choking sensation roused me briefly, long enough to see the flash of terror in Jamie\u2019s eyes. Then my vision went dark again.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, Sassenach!\u201d his voice said, from a very great distance. His voice was choked with passion. \u201cDamn you! I swear if ye die on me, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>I was dead. Everything around me was a blinding white, and there was a soft, rushing noise like the wings of angels. I felt peaceful and bodiless, free of terror, free of rage, filled with quiet happiness. Then I coughed.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t bodiless, after all. My leg hurt. It hurt a lot. I became gradually aware that a good many other things hurt, too, but my left shin took precedence in no uncertain terms. I had the distinct impression that the bone had been removed and replaced with a red-hot poker.</p><p>At least the leg was demonstrably there. When I cracked my eyes open to look, the haze of pain that floated over my leg seemed almost visible, though perhaps that was only a product of the general fuzziness in my head. Whether mental or physical in origin, the general effect was of a sort of whirling whiteness, shot with flickers of a brighter light. Watching it hurt my eyes, so I shut them again.</p><p>\u201cThank God, you\u2019re awake!\u201d said a relieved-sounding Scottish voice near my ear.</p><p>\u201cNo I\u2019m not,\u201d I said. My own voice emerged as a salt-crusted croak, rusty with swallowed seawater. I could feel seawater in my sinuses, too, which gave my head an unpleasant gurgling feel. I coughed again, and my nose began to run profusely. Then I sneezed.</p><p>\u201cEugh!\u201d I said, in complete revulsion at the resultant cascade of slime over my upper lip. My hand seemed far off and insubstantial, but I made the effort to raise it, swiping clumsily at my face.</p> <p>\u201cBe still, Sassenach; I\u2019ll take care of ye.\u201d There was a definite note of amusement in the voice, which irritated me enough to open my eyes again. I caught a brief glimpse of Jamie\u2019s face, intent on mine, before vision vanished once again in the folds of an immense white handkerchief.</p><p>He wiped my face thoroughly, ignoring my strangled noises of protest and impending suffocation, then held the cloth to my nose.</p><p>\u201cBlow,\u201d he said.</p><p>I did as he said. Rather to my surprise, it helped quite a lot. I could think more or less coherently, now that my head was unclogged.</p><p>Jamie smiled down at me. His hair was rumpled and stiff with dried salt, and there was a wide abrasion on his temple, an angry dark red against the bronzed skin. He seemed not to be wearing a shirt, but had a blanket of some kind draped about his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo ye feel verra bad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHorrible,\u201d I croaked in reply. I was also beginning to be annoyed at being alive, after all, and being required to take notice of things again. Hearing the rasp in my voice, Jamie reached for a jug of water on the table by my bed.</p><p>I blinked in confusion, but it really was a bed, not a berth or a hammock. The linen sheets contributed to the overwhelming impression of whiteness that had first engulfed me. This was reinforced by the whitewashed walls and ceiling, and the long white muslin draperies that bellied in like sails, rustling in the breeze from the open windows.</p><p>The flickering light came from reflections that shimmered over the ceiling; apparently there was water close by outside, and sun shining on it. It seemed altogether cozier than Davy Jones\u2019s locker. Still, I felt a brief moment of intense regret for the sense of infinite peace. I had experienced in the heart of the wave\u2014a regret made more keen by the slight movement that sent a bolt of white agony up my leg.</p><p>\u201cI think your leg is broken, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie told me unnecessarily. \u201cYe likely shouldna move it much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice,\u201d I said, through gritted teeth. \u201cWhere in bloody hell are we?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged briefly. \u201cI dinna ken. It\u2019s a fair-sized house, is all I could say. I wasna taking much note when they brought us in. One man said the place is called Les Perles.\u201d He held the cup to my lips and I swallowed gratefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d So long as I was careful not to move, the pain in my leg was bearable. Automatically, I placed my fingers under the angle of my jaw to check my pulse; reassuringly strong. I wasn\u2019t in shock; my leg couldn\u2019t be badly fractured, much as it hurt.</p><p>Jamie rubbed a hand over his face. He looked very tired, and I noticed that his hand trembled with fatigue. There was a large bruise on his cheek, and a line of dried blood where something had scratched the side of his neck.</p><p>\u201cThe topmast snapped, I think. One of the spars fell and knocked ye overboard. When ye hit the water, ye sank like a stone, and I dived in after you. I got hold of you\u2014and the spar, too, thank God. Ye had a bit of rigging tangled round your leg, dragging ye down, but I managed to get that off.\u201d He heaved a deep sigh, and rubbed his head.</p><p>\u201cI just held to ye; and after a time, I felt sand under my feet. I carried ye ashore, and a bit later, some men found us and brought us here. That\u2019s all.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>I felt cold, despite the warm breeze coming in through the windows.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the ship? And the men? Ian? Lawrence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe, I think. They couldna reach us, with the mast broken\u2014by the time they\u2019d rigged a makeshift sail, we were long gone.\u201d He coughed roughly, and rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. \u201cBut they\u2019re safe; the men who found us said they\u2019d seen a small ketch go aground on a mud flat a quarter-mile south of here; they\u2019ve gone down to salvage and bring back the men.\u201d</p><p>He took a swallow of water, swished it about his mouth, and going to the window, spat it out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sand in my teeth,\u201d he said, grimacing, as he returned. \u201cAnd my ears. And my nose, and the crack of my arse, too, I shouldna wonder.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and took his hand again. His palm was heavily calloused, but still showed the tender swelling of rising blisters, with shreds of ragged skin and raw flesh, where earlier blisters had burst and bled.</p><p>\u201cHow long were we in the water?\u201d I asked, gently tracing the lines of his swollen palm. The tiny \u201cC\u201d at the base of his thumb was faded almost to invisibility, but I could still feel it under my finger. \u201cJust how long did you hold on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>He smiled a little, and held my hand more tightly, despite the soreness of his own. It dawned on me suddenly that I wasn\u2019t wearing anything; the linen sheets were smooth and cool on my bare skin, and I could see the swell of my ni**les, rising under the thin fabric.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldna hold ye up against the drag of your skirts, so I ripped them off,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat was left didna seem worth saving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose so,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cbut Jamie\u2014what about you? Where\u2019s your coat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, then let his shoulders drop, and smiled ruefully.</p><p>\u201cAt the bottom of the sea with my shoon, I expect,\u201d he said. And the pictures of Willie and Brianna there, too.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jamie. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I reached for his hand and held it tightly. He looked away, and blinked once or twice.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI expect I will remember them.\u201d He shrugged again, with a lopsided smile. \u201cAnd if not, I can look in the glass, no?\u201d I gave a laugh that was half a sob; he swallowed painfully, but went on smiling.</p><p>He glanced down at his tattered breeches then, and seeming to think of something, leaned back and worked a hand into the pocket.</p><p>\u201cI didna come away completely empty-handed,\u201d he said, pulling a wry face. \u201cThough I would as soon it had been the pictures I kept, and lost these.\u201d</p><p>He opened his hand, and I saw the gleam and glitter in his ruined palm. Stones of the first quality, cut and faceted, suitable for magic. An emerald, a ruby\u2014male, I supposed\u2014a great fiery opal, a turquoise blue as the sky I could see out the window, a golden stone like sun trapped in honey, and the strange crystal purity of Geilie\u2019s black diamond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have the adamant,\u201d I said, touching it gently.

The knowledge of joy in all things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was told.\u201d I lifted my hand to his face and stroked it lightly, feeling hard bone and lively flesh, warm to the touch, and joyful to behold above all things.</p><p>\u201cWe have Ian,\u201d I said softly. \u201cAnd each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true.\u201d The smile reached his eyes then. He dropped the stones in a glittering heap on the table and leaned back in his chair, cradling my hand between his.</p><p>I relaxed, feeling a warm peace begin to steal over me, in spite of the aches and scrapes and the pain in my leg. We were alive, safe and together, and very little else mattered; surely not clothes, nor a fractured tibia. Everything would be managed in time\u2014but not now. For now, it was enough only to breathe, and look at Jamie.</p><p>We sat in a peaceful silence for some time, watching the sunlit curtains and the open sky. It might have been ten minutes later, or as much as an hour, when I heard the sound of light footsteps outside, and a delicate rap at the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Jamie said. He sat up straighter, but didn\u2019t let go of my hand.</p><p>The door opened, and a woman stepped in, her pleasant face lit by welcome, tinged with curiosity.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, a little shyly. \u201cI must beg your pardon, not to have waited upon you before; I was in the town, and learned of your\u2014arrival\u201d\u2014she smiled at the word\u2014\u201conly when I returned, just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must thank ye, Madame, most sincerely, for the kind treatment afforded to us,\u201d Jamie said. He rose and bowed formally to her, but kept hold of my hand. \u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am. Have ye word of our companions?\u201d</p><p>She blushed slightly, and bobbed a curtsy in reply to his bow. She was young, only in her twenties, and seemed unsure quite how to conduct herself under the circumstances. She had light brown hair, pulled back in a knot, fair pink skin, and what I thought was a faint West Country accent.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cMy servants brought them back from the ship; they\u2019re in the kitchen now, being fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, meaning it. \u201cThat\u2019s terribly kind of you.\u201d</p><p>She blushed rosily with embarrassment.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d she murmured, then glanced shyly at me. \u201cI must beg your pardon for my lack of manners, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said. \u201cI am remiss in not introducing myself. I am Patsy Olivier\u2014Mrs. Joseph Olivier, that is.\u201d She looked expectantly from me to Jamie, clearly expecting reciprocation.</p><p>Jamie and I exchanged a glance. Where, exactly, were we? Mrs. Olivier was English, that was clear enough. Her husband\u2019s name was French. The bay outside gave no clue; this could be any of the Windward Isles\u2014Barbados, the Bahamas, the Exumas, Andros\u2014even the Virgin Islands. Or\u2014the thought struck me\u2014we might have been blown south by the hurricane, and not north; in which case, this might even be Antigua\u2014in the lap of the British Navy!\u2014or Martinique, or the Grenadines...I looked at Jamie and shrugged.</p><p>Our hostess was still waiting, glancing expectantly from one to the other of us. Jamie tightened his hold on my hand and drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI trust ye willna think this an odd question, Mistress Olivier\u2014but could ye tell me where we are?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Olivier\u2019s brows rose to the edge of her widow\u2019s peak, and she blinked in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWell...yes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call it Les Perles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I put in, seeing Jamie taking breath to try again, \u201cbut what we mean is\u2014what island is this?\u201d</p><p>A broad smile of understanding broke out on her round pink face.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I see!\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, you were cast away by the storm. My husband was saying last night that he\u2019d never seen such a dreadful blow at this time of year. What a mercy it is that you were saved! But you came from the islands to the south, then?\u201d</p><p>The south. This couldn\u2019t be Cuba. Might we have come as far as St. Thomas, or even Florida? We exchanged a quick glance, and I squeezed Jamie\u2019s hand. I could feel the pulse beating in his wrist.</p><p>Mrs. Olivier smiled indulgently. \u201cYou are not on an island at all. You are on the mainland; in the Colony of Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAmerica?\u201d He sounded slightly stunned, and no wonder. We had been blown at least six hundred miles by the storm.</p><p>\u201cAmerica,\u201d I said softly. \u201cThe New World.\u201d The pulse beneath my fingers had quickened, echoing my own. A new world. Refuge. Freedom.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Olivier, plainly having no idea what the news meant to us, but still smiling kindly from one to the other. \u201cIt is America.\u201d</p><p>Jamie straightened his shoulders and smiled back at her. The clean bright air stirred his hair like kindling flames.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, \u201cmy name is Jamie Fraser.\u201d He looked then at me, eyes blue and brilliant as the sky behind him, and his heart beat strong in the palm of my hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Claire,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
