Ancient, towering evergreens grow in dense thickets on either side, their mossy, spearlike trunks rising high enough into the summer sky to block out the sun. Shadows lie knee-deep along the worn ribbon of asphalt; the air is still and quiet, like an indrawn breath. Expectant.</p> <p>Once, this road had simply been the way home. She\u2019d taken it easily, turning onto its potholed surface without a second thought, rarely\u2014if ever\u2014noticing how the earth dropped away on either side. Her mind had been on other things back then, on the minutiae of everyday life. Chores. Errands. Schedules.</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t taken this route in years. One glimpse of the faded green street sign had been enough to make her turn the steering wheel too sharply; better to go off the road than to find herself here. Or so she\u2019d thought until today.</p><p>People on the island still talk about what happened in the summer of \u201904. They sit on barstools and in porch swings and spout opinions, half-truths, making judgments that aren\u2019t theirs to make. They think a few columns in a newspaper give them the facts they need. But the facts are hardly what matter.</p><p>If anyone sees her here, just standing on this lonely roadside in a pocket of shadows, it will all come up again. They\u2019ll remember that night, so long ago, when the rain turned to ash ...</p><p>Part One</p> <p>Midway upon the journey of our life</p><p>I found myself within a forest dark,</p><p>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p><p>\u2014DANTE ALIGHIERI, THE INFERNO</p><p>One</p><p>2000</p> <p>Lexi Baill studied a Washington State map until the tiny red geographical markings shimmied in front of her tired eyes. There was a vaguely magical air about the place names; they hinted at a landscape she could hardly imagine, of snow-draped mountains that came right down to the water\u2019s edge, of trees as tall and straight as church steeples, of an endless, smogless blue sky. She pictured eagles perched on telephone poles and stars that seemed close enough to grasp. Bears probably crept through the quiet subdivisions at night, looking for places that not long ago had been theirs.</p><p>Her new home.</p><p>She wanted to think that her life would be different there. But how could she believe that, really? At fourteen, she might not know much, but she knew this: kids in the system were returnable, like old soda bottles and shoes that pinched your toes.</p><p>Yesterday, she\u2019d been wakened early by her caseworker and told to pack her things. Again.</p><p>\u201cI have good news,\u201d Ms. Watters had said.</p><p>Even half-asleep, Lexi knew what that meant. \u201cAnother family. That\u2019s great. Thanks, Ms. Watters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just a family. Your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course. My new family. It\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p> <p>Ms. Watters made that disappointed sound, a soft exhalation of breath that wasn\u2019t quite a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ve been strong, Lexi. For so long.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tried to smile. \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, Ms. W. I know how hard it is to place older kids. And the Rexler family was cool. If my mom hadn\u2019t come back, I think that one would have worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it was your fault, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lexi said. On good days she could make herself believe that the people who returned her had their own problems. On bad days\u2014and they were coming more often lately\u2014she wondered what was wrong with her, why she was so easy to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou have relatives, Lexi. I found your great-aunt. Her name is Eva Lange. She\u2019s sixty-six years old and she lives in Port George, Washington.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sat up. \u201cWhat? My mom said I had no relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was ... mistaken. You do have family.\u201d</p><p>Lexi had spent a lifetime waiting for those few precious words. Her world had always been dangerous, uncertain, a ship heading for the shoals. She had grown up mostly alone, among strangers, a modern-day feral child fighting for scraps of food and attention, never receiving enough of either. Most of it she\u2019d blocked out entirely, but when she tried\u2014when one of the State shrinks made her try\u2014she could remember being hungry, wet, reaching out for a mother who was too high to hear her or too strung out to care. She remembered sitting for days in a dirty playpen, crying, waiting for someone to remember her existence.</p><p>Now, she stared out the dirty window of a Greyhound bus. Her caseworker sat beside her, reading a romance novel.</p><p>After more than twenty-six hours en route, they were finally nearing their destination. Outside, a steel-wool sky swallowed the treetops. Rain made squiggling patterns on the window, blurring the view. It was like another planet here in Washington; gone were the sun-scorched bread-crust-colored hills of Southern California and the gray crisscross of traffic-clogged freeways. The trees were steroid-big; so were the mountains. Everything seemed overgrown and wild.</p><p>The bus pulled up to a squat, cement-colored terminal and came to a wheezing, jerking stop. A cloud of black smoke wafted across her window, obscuring the parking lot for a moment; then the rain pounded it away. The bus doors whooshed open.</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d</p><p>She heard Ms. Watters\u2019s voice and thought move, Lexi, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She looked up at the woman who had been the only steady presence in her life for the last six years. Every time a foster family had given up on Lexi, returned her like a piece of fruit gone bad, Ms. Watters had been there, waiting with a sad little smile. It wasn\u2019t much to return to, maybe, but it was all Lexi knew, and suddenly she was afraid to lose even that small familiarity.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t come?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>Ms. Watters held out her hand, with its veiny, twiglike fingers and big knuckles. \u201cShe will.\u201d</p><p>Lexi took a deep breath. She could do this. Of course she could. She had moved into seven foster homes in the past five years, and gone to six different schools in the same amount of time. She could handle this.</p><p>She reached out for Ms. Watters\u2019s hand. They walked single file down the narrow bus aisle, bumping the cushioned seats on either side of them.</p><p>Off the bus, Lexi retrieved her scuffed red suitcase, which was almost too heavy to carry, filled as it was with the only things that really mattered to her: books. She dragged it to the very edge of the sidewalk and stood there, perched at the rim of the curb. It felt like a dangerous drop-off, that little cliff of concrete. One wrong step could break a bone or send her headlong into traffic.</p><p>Ms. Watters came up beside Lexi, opening an umbrella. The rain made a thumping sound on the stretched nylon.</p><p>One by one, the other passengers disembarked from the bus and disappeared.</p><p>Lexi looked at the empty parking lot and wanted to cry. How many times had she been in exactly this position? Every time Momma dried out, she came back for her daughter. Give me another chance, baby girl. Tell the nice judge here you love me. I\u2019ll be better this time ... I won\u2019t forget about you no more. And every time, Lexi waited. \u201cShe probably changed her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have family, Lexi,\u201d Ms. Watters repeated the terrifying words and Lexi slipped; hope tiptoed in.</p><p>\u201cFamily.\u201d She dared to test out the unfamiliar word. It melted on her tongue like candy, leaving sweetness behind.</p><p>A banged-up blue Ford Fairlane pulled up in front of them and parked. The car was dented along the fender and underlined in rust. Duct tape crisscrossed a cracked window.</p><p>The driver\u2019s door opened slowly and a woman emerged. She was short and gray-haired, with watery brown eyes and the kind of diamond-patterned skin that came with heavy smoking. Amazingly, she looked familiar\u2014like an older, wrinkled version of Momma. At that, the impossible word came back to Lexi, swollen now with meaning. Family.</p><p>\u201cAlexa?\u201d the woman said in a scratchy voice.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t make herself answer. She wanted this woman to smile, or maybe even hug her, but Eva Lange just stood there, her dried-apple face turned into a deep frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your great-aunt. Your grandmother\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew my grandmother,\u201d was all Lexi could think of to say.</p><p>\u201cAll this time, I thought you were living with your daddy\u2019s people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a dad. I mean, I don\u2019t know who he is. Momma didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Eva sighed. \u201cI know that now, thanks to Ms. Watters here. Is that all your stuff?\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt a wave of shame. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Watters gently took the suitcase from Lexi and put it in the backseat. \u201cGo on, Lexi. Get in the car. Your aunt wants you to live with her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, for now.</p><p>Ms. Watters pulled Lexi into a fierce hug, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Lexi almost hung on too long. At the last second, before it turned embarrassing, she let go and stumbled free. She went to the battered car and wrenched the door open. It rattled and pinged and swung wide.</p><p>Inside, the car had two brown vinyl bench seats, with cracked seams that burped up a gray padding. It smelled like a mixture of mint and smoke, as if a million menthol cigarettes had been smoked within.</p><p>Lexi sat as close to the door as possible. Through the cracked window, she waved at Ms. Watters, watching her caseworker disappear into the gray haze as they drove away. She let her fingertips graze the cold glass, as if a little touch like that could connect her with a woman she could no longer see.</p><p>\u201cI was sorry to hear about your momma passing,\u201d Aunt Eva said after a long and uncomfortable silence. \u201cShe\u2019s in a better place now. That must be a comfort to you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi had never known what to say to that. It was a sentiment she\u2019d heard from every stranger who\u2019d ever taken her in. Poor Lexi, with her dead, drug-addict mother. But no one really knew what Momma\u2019s life had been like\u2014the men, the heroin, the vomiting, the pain. Or how terrible the end had been. Only Lexi knew all of that.</p><p>She stared out the window at this new place of hers. It was bold and green and dark, even in the middle of the day. After a few miles, a sign welcomed them to the Port George reservation. Here, there were Native American symbols everywhere. Carved orca whales marked the shop fronts. Manufactured homes sat on untended lots, many of them with rusting cars or appliances in the yard. On this late August afternoon, empty fireworks stands attested to the recent holiday, and a glittering casino was being built on a hillside overlooking the Sound.</p><p>Signs led them to the Chief Sealth Mobile Home Park. Aunt Eva drove through the park and pulled up in front of a yellow and white double-wide trailer. In the misty rain, it looked blurred somehow, rounded with disappointment. Plastic gray pots full of leggy, dying petunias guarded the front door, which was painted Easter-egg blue. In the front window, a pair of plaid curtains hung like fabric hourglasses, cinched in the middle with strands of fuzzy yellow yarn.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t much,\u201d Aunt Eva said, looking ashamed. \u201cI rent from the tribe.\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know what to say. If her aunt had seen some of the places Lexi had lived in her life, she wouldn\u2019t have made excuses for this pretty little trailer. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d her aunt said, turning off the engine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi followed her aunt across a gravel path and up to the front door. Inside, the mobile home was neat as a pin. A small, L-shaped kitchen sidled up to a dining area that held a yellow speckled Formica and chrome table with four chairs. In the living room, a plaid loveseat and two blue vinyl La-Z-Boys faced a TV on a metal stand. On the end table there were two pictures\u2014one of an old woman with horn-rimmed glasses and one of Elvis. The air smelled like cigarette smoke and fake flowers. There were purple air fresheners hanging from almost every knob in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSorry if the place kinda smells. I quit smoking last week\u2014when I found out about you,\u201d Aunt Eva said, turning to look at Lexi. \u201cSecondhand smoke and kids is a bad mix, right?\u201d</p><p>A strange feeling overtook Lexi; it was birdlike, fluttery, and so foreign she didn\u2019t recognize the emotion right away.</p><p>Hope.</p> <p>This stranger, this aunt, had quit smoking for her. And she\u2019d taken Lexi in when obviously money was tight. She looked at the woman, wanting to say something, but nothing came out. She was afraid she might jinx everything with the wrong word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kinda outta my depth here, Lexi,\u201d Aunt Eva finally said. \u201cOscar and me\u2014he was my husband\u2014we never had kids. Tried, just din\u2019t. So, I don\u2019t know about raising kids. If you\u2019re gonna be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be good. I swear it.\u201d Don\u2019t change your mind. Please. \u201cIf you keep me, you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I keep you?\u201d Aunt Eva pursed her thin lips, gave a little frown. \u201cYour momma sure did a number on you. Can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. She broke my sister\u2019s heart, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was good at hurting people,\u201d Lexi said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re family,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know what that means.\u201d</p><p>Aunt Eva smiled, but it was sad, that smile, and it wounded Lexi, reminded her that she was a little broken. Life with Momma had left its mark. \u201cIt means you\u2019re staying here with me. And I guess you\u2019d best just call me Eva from now on, \u2019cause that Aunt bit is gonna get old fast.\u201d She started to turn away.</p><p>Lexi grabbed her aunt\u2019s thin wrist, feeling the velvety-soft skin wrinkle in her grasp. She hadn\u2019t meant to do it, shouldn\u2019t have done it, but it was too late now.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>Lexi could hardly form the two small words; they felt like a pair of stones in her tight throat. But she had to say them. Had to. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, her eyes stinging. \u201cI won\u2019t cause you any trouble. I swear it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou probably will,\u201d Eva said, and finally, she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re a teenager, right? But it\u2019s okay, Lexi. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been alone a long time. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Lexi could only nod. She\u2019d been alone a long time, too.</p><p>Jude Farraday hadn\u2019t slept at all last night. Finally, just before dawn, she gave up even trying. Peeling back the summer-weight comforter, taking care not to wake her sleeping husband, she got out of bed and left her bedroom. Opening the French doors quietly, she stepped outside.</p><p>In the emergent light, her backyard glistened with dew; lush green grass sloped gently down to a sandy gray-pebbled beach. Beyond it, the Sound was a series of charcoal-colored waves that rolled and rolled, their peaks painted orange by the dawn. On the opposite shore, the Olympic mountain range was a jagged line of pink and lavender.</p><p>She stepped into the plastic gardening clogs that were always by the door and went into her garden.</p><p>This patch of land was more than just her pride and joy. It was her sanctuary. Here, hunkered down in the rich black earth, she planted and replanted, divided and pruned. Within these low stone walls, she had created a world that was wholly defined by beauty and order. The things she planted in this ground stayed where she put them; they sent out roots that ran deep into this land. No matter how cold and bitter the winter or how driving the rainstorms, her beloved plants came back to life, returning with the seasons.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early.\u201d</p><p>She turned. Her husband stood on the stone patio, just outside their bedroom door. In a pair of black boxer shorts, with his too long, graying-blond hair still tangled from sleep, he looked like some sexy classics professor or a just-past-his-prime rock star. No wonder she\u2019d fallen in love with him at first sight, more than twenty-four years ago.</p> <p>She kicked off the orange clogs and walked along the stone path from the garden to the patio. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>He took her in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s the first day of school.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, the thing that had crept into her sleep like a burglar and ruined her peace. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re starting high school. They were just in kindergarten a second ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an interesting ride, seeing who they become in the next four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting for you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re in the stands, watching the game. I\u2019m down on the field, taking the hits. I\u2019m terrified something will go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can go wrong? They\u2019re smart, curious, loving kids. They\u2019ve got everything going for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can go wrong? Are you kidding? It\u2019s ... dangerous out there, Miles. We\u2019ve been able to keep them safe up until now, but high school is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let up a little, you know.\u201d</p><p>It was the sort of thing he said to her all the time. A lot of people gave her the same advice, actually, and had for years. She\u2019d been criticized for holding the reins of parenthood too tightly, of controlling her children too completely, but she didn\u2019t know how to let go. From the moment she\u2019d first decided to become a mother, it had been an epic battle. She had suffered through three miscarriages before the twins. And there had been month after month when the arrival of her period had sent her into a gray and hazy depression. Then, a miracle: she\u2019d conceived again. The pregnancy had been difficult, always tenuous, and she\u2019d been sentenced to almost six months of bed rest. Every day as she\u2019d lain in that bed, imagining her babies, she\u2019d pictured it as a war, a battle of wills. She\u2019d held on with all her heart. \u201cNot yet,\u201d she finally said. \u201cThey\u2019re only fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cJust a little. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. You check their homework every day and chaperone every dance and organize every school function. You make them breakfast and drive them everywhere they need to go. You clean their rooms and wash their clothes. If they forget to do their chores, you make excuses and do it all yourself. They\u2019re not spotted owls. Let them loose a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I give up? If I stop checking homework, Mia will stop doing it. Or maybe I should quit calling their friends\u2019 parents to make sure the kids are going where they say they\u2019re going? When I was in high school we had keggers every weekend, and two of my girlfriends got pregnant. I need to keep better track of them now, trust me. So many things can go wrong in the next four years. I need to protect them. Once they go to college, I\u2019ll relax. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right college,\u201d he teased, but they both knew it wasn\u2019t really a joke. The twins were freshmen in high school and Jude had already begun to research colleges.</p><p>She looked up at him, wanting him to understand. He thought she was too invested in their children, and she understood his concern, but she was a mother, and she didn\u2019t know how to be casual about it. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought that her children would grow up as she had, feeling unloved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like her, Jude,\u201d he said quietly, and she loved him for saying it. She rested against him; together they watched the day brighten, and Miles finally said, \u201cWell, I better get going. I have a surgery at ten.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him deeply, then followed him back into the house. After a quick shower, she dried her shoulder-length blond hair, put on a thin layer of makeup, and dressed in jeans and a boatnecked cashmere sweater and faded jeans. Opening her dresser drawer, she withdrew two small wrapped packages; one for each of her children. Taking them with her, she walked out of her bedroom, down the wide slate hallway. With morning sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows, this house, constructed mostly of glass and stone and exotic woods, seemed to glow from within. On this main floor, every viewpoint boasted some decorating treasure. Jude had spent four years huddled with architects and designers to make this home spectacular, and her every dream for it had been realized.</p><p>Upstairs, it was a different story. Here, at the top of a floating stone and copper stairway, it was kidland. A giant media room, complete with big-screen TV and a pool table, dominated the east side of the house. Additionally there were two large bedrooms, each with their own en suite bathroom.</p><p>At Mia\u2019s bedroom door, she knocked perfunctorily and went inside.</p><p>As expected, she found her fourteen-year-old daughter sprawled on top of the blankets in her four-postered bed, asleep. There were clothes everywhere, like shrapnel from some mythic explosion, heaped and piled and kicked aside. Mia was actively engaged in a search for identity, and each new attempt required a radical clothing change.</p><p>Jude sat down on the edge of the bed and stroked the soft blond hair that fell across Mia\u2019s cheek. For a moment, time fell away; suddenly she was a young mother again, looking down at a cherubic girl with corn-silk hair and a gummy grin who\u2019d followed her twin brother around like his shadow. They\u2019d been like puppies, scrambling over each other in their exuberant play, chattering nonstop in their secret language, laughing, tumbling off sofa and steps and laps. From the very start, Zach had been the leader of this pair. He\u2019d spoken first and most often. Mia hadn\u2019t uttered a real word until after her fourth birthday. She hadn\u2019t needed to; her brother was there for her. Then and now.</p><p>Mia rolled over sleepily and opened her eyes, blinking slowly. Her pale, heart-shaped face, with its gorgeous bone structure\u2014inherited from her father\u2014was an acne battlefield that no amount of care had yet been able to clear. Multicolored rubberbands looped through her braces. \u201cHola, Madre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first day of high school.\u201d</p><p>Mia grimaced. \u201cShoot me. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better than middle school. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you. Can\u2019t you homeschool me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember sixth grade? When I tried to help you with your math homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisaster,\u201d Mia said glumly. \u201cIt could be better now, though. I wouldn\u2019t get so mad at you.\u201d</p><p>Jude stroked her daughter\u2019s soft hair. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide out from life, Poppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hide out from life. Just from high school. It\u2019s like swimming with sharks, Mom. Honest. I could lose a foot.\u201d</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cSee? You have a great sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say when they\u2019re trying to set up an ugly girl. Thanks, Madre. And who cares, anyway? It\u2019s not like I have friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Zach has friends who try to be nice to his loser sister.

Inside lay a thin pink leather diary with a gleaming brass lock.</p><p>\u201cI had one when I was your age, and I wrote down everything that happened to me. It can help\u2014writing stuff down. I was shy, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Mia. I wish you saw that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right. Zits and braces are all the rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be open to people, okay, Mia? This is a new school, make it a new opportunity, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ve been going to school with the same kids since kindergarten. I don\u2019t think a new address is going to help. Besides, I tried being open ... with Haley, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was more than a year ago, Mia. It doesn\u2019t do any good to focus on the bad things that happen. Today is the first day of high school. A new start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Mia tried gamely to smile.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now get out of bed. I want to get to school early today, so I can help you find your locker and get you settled into first period. You have Mr. Davies for geometry; I want him to know how well you did on the WASL test.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are not walking me into class. And I can find my locker by myself, too.\u201d</p><p>Intellectually, Jude knew that Mia was right, but Jude wasn\u2019t ready to let go. Not yet. Too many things could go wrong. Mia was fragile, too easily flustered. What if someone made fun of her?</p><p>A mother\u2019s job was to protect her kids\u2014whether they wanted it or not. She stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll be practically invisible. You\u2019ll see. No one will even know I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>Mia groaned.</p><p>Two</p><p>On the first day of school, Lexi woke early and staggered down the narrow hallway to the bathroom. One look in the mirror confirmed her worst fears: her skin was pale, a little sallow, even, and her blue eyes were puffy and bloodshot. She must have cried in her sleep again.</p><p>She took a quick, lukewarm shower, careful not to waste her aunt\u2019s money. There was no real point in drying her hair. The waist-length black strands would curl and frizz and do whatever they wanted to, so she pulled it all into a ponytail and went back to her room.</p><p>There, she opened her closet door and stared at the few articles of clothing she owned. There were so few choices ...</p> <p>What did kids wear here? Would Pine Island be like Brentwood or the Hills, where kids dressed like avant-garde fashion models? Or East L.A., where rap-star wannabes and grungoids filled the classrooms?</p><p>There was a knock at her bedroom door, so quiet Lexi barely heard it. She made her bed quickly and then opened the door.</p><p>Eva stood there, holding a cotton-candy-pink sweatshirt with a rhinestone butterfly bedazzled onto the front. The kidney-shaped wings were purple and yellow and shamrock green. \u201cI got this for you at work yesterday. I figured every girl should have something new to wear on the first day of high school.\u201d</p><p>It was the ugliest thing Lexi had ever seen, better suited to a four-year-old than a fourteen-year-old, but she loved it instantly. No one had ever bought her something special for the first day of school. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said, feeling a tightening in her throat. She\u2019d only lived with her aunt for four days, and every hour she felt a little more at home. It scared her, that settling in. She knew how dangerous it could be to start liking a place. A person.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wear it if you don\u2019t want to. I just thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to wear it. Thanks, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt gave her a smile so bright it bunched up her cheeks. \u201cI told Mildred you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Eva bobbed her head in a little nod and backed into the hallway, closing the door behind her. Lexi put on the pink sweatshirt and stepped into a pair of faded Target jeans. Then she filled her hand-me-down backpack with the notebooks, paper, and pens Eva had brought home from work last night.</p><p>In the kitchen, she found Eva standing by the sink, dressed now for work in her blue Walmart smock, lemon-yellow acrylic sweater, and jeans, drinking coffee.</p><p>Across the small, tidy space, their gazes met. Eva\u2019s brown eyes looked worried. \u201cMrs. Watters worked hard to get you into Pine Island High. It\u2019s one of the best schools in the state, but the school bus don\u2019t come over the bridge, so you\u2019ll have to take the county bus. Is that okay? Have I already told you all this?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Eva. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve been riding buses for years.\u201d She didn\u2019t add that she\u2019d often slept on their dirty seats when she and Momma had nowhere else to go.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Eva finished her coffee and rinsed out her cup, leaving it in the sink. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t want to be late on your first day. I\u2019ll drive you. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take the bus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on the first day. I got the late-shift special.\u201d</p><p>Lexi followed her aunt out to the car. As they drove toward the island, Lexi studied her surroundings. She\u2019d seen all of this on maps, but those little lines and markings only told so much of the story. For instance, she knew that Pine Island was twelve miles long and four miles wide; that it was accessible by ferry to downtown Seattle and by bridge to mainland Kitsap County. On the Port George side of the bridge, the land was tribal. Pine Island, she saw now, was not.</p><p>She could tell by the houses that the people who lived on the island were rich. The houses over here were practically mansions.</p><p>They turned off the highway and drove up a hill to the high school, which was a collection of squat redbrick buildings huddled around a flagpole. Like many of the schools Lexi had attended, Pine Island had obviously grown faster than expected. A collection of portables ringed the main campus. Eva parked in the empty bus lane and looked at Lexi. \u201cThese kids are no better\u2019n you. You remember that.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt a rush of affection for this careworn woman who had taken her in. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Eva nodded. \u201cGood luck,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t say that luck was useless at a new school. Instead, she forced a smile and got out of the car. As she waved good-bye, a school bus pulled up behind Eva, and kids poured out of it.</p><p>Lexi kept her head down and started moving. She\u2019d been the new girl often enough to know the tricks of the camouflage trade. The best tactic was to blend in, disappear. You did that by looking down and moving fast. Rule one: never stop. Rule two: never look up. By Friday, if she\u2019d followed this pattern, she\u2019d just be one of the kids in the freshman class, and then she could try to make a friend or two. Although it wouldn\u2019t be easy here. What could she possibly have in common with these kids?</p><p>When she made it to Building A, she double-checked her schedule. There it was. Room 104. She merged into the crowd of students, all of whom seemed to know one another, and let their tide carry her forward. In the classroom, kids slid into their seats and kept talking excitedly.</p><p>Her mistake was to pause. She looked up just long enough to get her bearings, and the classroom went quiet. Kids stared at her; then whispering began. Someone laughed. Lexi felt her flaws keenly\u2014her thick black eyebrows and crooked teeth and frizzy hair, her lame jeans and lamer sweatshirt. This was the kind of place where every kid got braces at adolescence and a new car at sixteen.</p><p>In the back of the room, a girl pointed at her and started to giggle. The girl seated beside her nodded. Lexi thought she heard nice butterfly, and then: did she make it herself?</p><p>A boy stood up, and the room went quiet again.</p><p>Lexi knew who he was. Every school had a guy like him\u2014good-looking, popular, athletic, the kind of boy who got what he wanted without even trying. The football captain and class president. In his aqua blue Abercrombie T-shirt and baggy jeans, he looked like Leonardo DiCaprio, all golden and smiling and sure of himself.</p><p>He was coming toward her. Why? Was there another, prettier girl behind her? Was he going to do something to humiliate her, to make his friends laugh?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. She could feel everyone looking at them, watching.</p><p>Lexi bit her lower lip to hide her crooked teeth. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSusan and Liz are bitches. Don\u2019t let them get to you. The butterfly\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>She stood there like an idiot, dazzled by his smile. Get a grip, Lexi. You\u2019ve seen good-looking guys before. She should say something, smile; something.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, taking her arm. At his touch, she felt a little jolt, like an electrical charge.</p><p>He should have moved, led her somewhere. That was why he was touching her arm, right? But he just stood there, staring down at her. His smile faded. She couldn\u2019t breathe all of a sudden; the whole world drained away until only his face was left, only his amazing green eyes.</p><p>He started to say something, but Lexi\u2019s heart was pounding so fast, she couldn\u2019t hear his words, and then he was being pulled away from her, led away by some beautiful girl in a skirt that was smaller than a dinner napkin.</p><p>Lexi stayed a moment too long, staring at his back, still feeling out of breath. Then she remembered where she was and who she was: the new girl in the bedazzled pink sweatshirt. Tucking her chin into her chest, she bolted forward, made her way to a seat in the back row. She slid onto its slick surface just as the bell rang.</p><p>As the teacher droned on about the early days of Seattle, Lexi replayed that moment, over and over. She told herself it meant nothing, the way he\u2019d touched her, but she couldn\u2019t let it go. What had he been going to say to her?</p><p>When the class ended, she dared to look at him. He moved with the crowd of students, laughing at something the girl in the miniskirt said. At Lexi\u2019s desk, he paused, looked down at her, although he didn\u2019t smile or stop. He kept moving.</p><p>Of course he didn\u2019t stop. She rose slowly and walked to the door. For the rest of the morning, she tried to hold her head high as she moved through the crowded halls, but by noon, she was lagging, and the worst was yet to come.</p><p>Lunch in a new school was hell. You never knew what was in and what was out, and the whole social order could be upset if you dared to sit where you weren\u2019t supposed to.</p><p>At the door to the cafeteria, Lexi paused. Just the idea of walking in there, being scrutinized and judged, was more than she could bear today. Normally she was stronger than that, but Mr. Popular had unbalanced her somehow, made her want the impossible, and she knew firsthand how waylaid one could be by longing. It was a waste of time. She walked back outside, where the sun was shining. She dug through her backpack, found the lunch Eva had packed for her and a well-read copy of Jane Eyre. Some kids had stuffed animals or special childhood blankets. Lexi had Jane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked idly through campus, looking for a place to sit down and read while she ate her lunch. Across the campus, she spied a pretty little tree growing up from a triangular patch of grass, but it wasn\u2019t the tree that caught her attention. It was the girl sitting cross-legged on the grass beneath its green canopy, hunched over a book. Her blond hair was divided into a pair of loosely twined braids. Dressed in a delicate pink tulle skirt, a black tank top, and black high-tops, she definitely made a statement.</p><p>It was a statement Lexi understood: I\u2019m not like you. I don\u2019t need you.</p><p>Lexi had spent a few years dressed the same way herself, back when she hadn\u2019t wanted to make friends, when she\u2019d been afraid of being asked where she lived or what her momma was like.</p><p>She took a deep breath and walked toward the girl. When she drew near, Lexi paused. She wanted to say the right thing, but now that she was here, she didn\u2019t know what that would be.</p> <p>The girl looked up from her book. She was fragile looking, with acne-blistered skin and green eyes that were rimmed with too much purple eyeliner. Brightly colored rubber bands accented her braces.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here. And he\u2019s not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>The girl gave a disinterested shrug and went back to reading. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I sit with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocial suicide,\u201d the girl said without looking up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The girl looked up again. \u201cIt\u2019s social suicide to sit with me. Even the theater kids won\u2019t hang with me. Yeah. It\u2019s that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I won\u2019t make the cheerleading squad? How tragic.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked interested in Lexi for the first time. A smile quirked her mouth. \u201cMost girls care about stuff like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Lexi dropped her backpack onto the grass. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWuthering Heights.\u201d</p><p>Lexi held out her own book. \u201cJane Eyre. Can I sit down?\u201d</p><p>The girl scooted sideways to make room on the small patch of grass. \u201cI haven\u2019t read that one. Is it good?\u201d</p><p>Lexi sat down beside her. \u201cMy favorite. When you\u2019re done with yours, we could trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be awesome. I\u2019m Mia, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi. So what\u2019s the book about?\u201d</p><p>Mia began talking slowly, stumbling over her words, but when she started talking about Heathcliff, she kind of took flight. The next thing Lexi knew, they were laughing as if they\u2019d been friends for years. When the bell rang, they got up and walked toward their lockers together, still talking the whole way across campus. Lexi didn\u2019t keep her head down anymore, didn\u2019t clamp her books to her chest or purposely not make eye contact with anyone. Instead, she laughed.</p> <p>Outside the door to her Spanish class, Mia stopped and said in a rush: \u201cYou could come to my house after school today. If you wanted to, I mean.\u201d She looked nervous as she asked it. \u201cI know you probably won\u2019t. No worries.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt like smiling; only nervousness over her teeth kept her in check. \u201cI would totally like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the flagpole by the admin building, okay?\u201d</p><p>Lexi went into her classroom and took a seat at the back. She eyed the clock for the rest of the day, willing time to speed up until finally at 2:50, she was at the flagpole, waiting. Kids swarmed around her, jostling one another as they made their way onto the buses lined up outside.</p><p>Maybe Mia wouldn\u2019t show. Probably she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Lexi was about to give up the whole thing when Mia came up beside her. \u201cYou waited,\u201d she said, sounding as relieved as Lexi felt. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Mia led the way through the hive of students, toward a shiny black Escalade parked out on the main road. She opened the passenger door and climbed in.</p><p>Lexi followed her new friend into the leather-scented beige seat.</p><p>\u201cHola, Madre,\u201d Mia said. \u201cThis is Lexi. I invited her home with me. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>The woman in the driver\u2019s seat turned around, and Lexi was stunned by her beauty. Mia\u2019s mom looked like Michelle Pfeiffer with her perfect, pale face and sleek blond hair. In an obviously expensive salmon-colored sweater, she looked like she belonged on the Nordstrom catalog cover. \u201cHello, Lexi. I\u2019m Jude. It\u2019s nice to meet you. And how is it that I don\u2019t know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. That explains it. Where did you move here from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hold that against you,\u201d Jude said with a bright smile. \u201cWill your mother mind if you\u2019re not home right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lexi said, tensing for the inevitable next question.</p><p>\u201cI could call her if you\u2019d like, introdu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo-om,\u201d Mia said, \u201cyou\u2019re doing that thing again.\u201d</p><p>Jude flashed Lexi a smile. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassing my daughter. Something I am sadly wont to do these days, just by breathing. But I can hardly stop being a mother, can I? I\u2019m sure your mom is just as embarrassing, right, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>Lexi had no idea what to say to that, but it didn\u2019t matter. Jude laughed and went on as if she hadn\u2019t asked a thing. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be seen and not heard. Fine. Buckle up, girls.\u201d</p><p>She started up the car, and Mia immediately started talking about a book she\u2019d heard about.</p><p>They drove away from the school and onto a pretty little main street. The traffic was stop-and-go all the way through town, but once they made it onto the highway, the road was clear. They followed one curvy, tree-lined, two-lane road after another until Jude said, \u201cHome sweet home,\u201d and turned onto a gravel driveway.</p><p>At first there was nothing but trees on either side of them, trees so tall and thick they blocked out the sun, but then the road curved again and they were in a clearing full of sunlight.</p><p>The house was like something out of a novel. It sat proudly amid its landscaping, a soaring structure made of wood and stone, with windows everywhere. Low stone walls delineated magnificent gardens. Behind it all was the blue Sound. Even from here, Lexi could hear waves hitting the shore.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Lexi said, getting out of the car. She had never been in a house like this before. How should she act? What should she say? She would do the wrong thing for sure and Mia would laugh at her.</p><p>Jude slipped an arm around her daughter and they walked ahead. \u201cI bet you girls are hungry. Why don\u2019t I make you some quesadillas? You can tell me about the first day of high school.\u201d</p><p>Lexi hung back instinctively.</p><p>At the front door, Mia looked back. \u201cLexi? You don\u2019t want to come in, do you? You\u2019ve changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt her insecurity dissolve, or perhaps more accurately, it joined with Mia\u2019s and morphed into something else. They were alike; impossibly, the girl who had nothing was like this girl who had everything. \u201cNo way,\u201d Lexi said, laughing as she hurried toward the door.</p><p>Inside, she slipped out of her shoes, seeing a second too late that her socks had holes in the toes. Embarrassed, she followed Mia into the magnificent house. There were walls of glass that framed a stunning ocean view, a stone fireplace, gleaming floors. She was afraid to touch anything.</p><p>Mia grabbed her hand and dragged her into a huge kitchen. There were gleaming copper pots hanging from a black skeletal thing above the eight-burner stove and fresh flowers in several places around the room. They sat down at a long black granite counter while Jude made quesadillas.</p><p>She just walked right up to me, Madre. And I told her it was social suicide to sit with me, but she didn\u2019t care. Is that cool or what?</p><p>Jude smiled at that, and started to say something, but Mia kept talking. Lexi could hardly keep up with Mia\u2019s steady stream of stories. It was as if Mia had been holding observations and thoughts inside of her for years, and now they were coming out. Lexi knew about that, about holding things inside and being afraid and trying to stay quiet. She and Mia compared opinions on high school, boys, classes, movies, tattoos, belly button piercings, and they agreed on everything. The more they agreed on, the more Lexi worried: what would happen when Mia found out about Lexi\u2019s past? Would Mia want to be friends with a drug addict\u2019s kid?</p><p>At about five o\u2019clock, the front door banged open and a group of kids burst into the house.</p><p>\u201cShoes,\u201d Jude yelled from the kitchen without looking up.</p><p>Nine or ten kids surged forward, boys and girls. Lexi could tell they were the popular kids. Anyone would have recognized them\u2014pretty girls in low-rise jeans and midriff-baring T-shirts, and boys in PIHS blue and yellow sweats. They\u2019d probably come here from football and cheerleader practice.</p><p>\u201cMy bro is the one in the gray sweats,\u201d Mia said, leaning closer. \u201cDon\u2019t judge him by the company he keeps. Those girls have the brains of breath mints.\u201d</p><p>It was the guy from first period.</p><p>He peeled away from the crowd with the ease of one who knew how popular he was and sidled up to Mia, putting an arm around her shoulders. The resemblance between them was startling; Mia\u2019s face was a feminine, sculpted version of his. He started to say something to his sister, and then he noticed Lexi. His gaze sharpened, grew so intense that she felt that fluttering start in her chest again. No one had ever looked at her like that before, as if everything about her was interesting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the new girl,\u201d he said quietly, pushing the long blond hair out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d Mia said, grinning so wide her braces were a multicolored blur.</p><p>His smile faded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lexi,\u201d she said, although he hadn\u2019t asked her her name.</p><p>He looked away from her, disinterested. \u201cI\u2019m Zach.\u201d</p><p>A girl in tiny shorts and a midriff-baring top moved in behind him, draped herself along his side, and whispered something in his ear. He didn\u2019t laugh, barely smiled in fact. Instead, he backed away from Lexi and Mia. \u201cLater, Me-my,\u201d he said to his sister. Slinging an arm around short-shorts girl, he led her toward the stairs and disappeared into the crowd of kids running upstairs.</p><p>Mia frowned at her. \u201cIs something wrong, Lexi? It\u2019s okay if I say you\u2019re my friend, right?\u201d</p><p>Lexi stared at the empty place where he\u2019d been, feeling unsettled. He\u2019d smiled at her, hadn\u2019t he? At first, for a second? What had she done wrong?</p><p>\u201cLexi? Is it okay if I tell people we\u2019re friends?\u201d</p><p>Lexi let out the breath she\u2019d been holding. She forced her attention away from the stairs. Seeing Mia\u2019s nervousness, she realized what was important here, and it wasn\u2019t a guy like Zach. No wonder he confused her. He would always be incomprehensible to a girl who\u2019d grown up in the weeds. What mattered was Mia and this fragile beginning of their friendship. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, smiling. For once, she didn\u2019t care about her teeth. She was pretty sure Mia wouldn\u2019t care. \u201cYou can tell everyone.\u201d</p><p>The media room was full of kids, as usual. Some women might be overwhelmed by the noise and mayhem, but not Jude. Years ago\u2014back when the twins were starting sixth grade\u2014she\u2019d made a conscious effort to make her house welcoming. She wanted the kids to hang out here. She\u2019d known herself well enough to know that she didn\u2019t want to be dropping her kids off into other women\u2019s care; she wanted to be the one in charge. To that end, she\u2019d designed the upstairs carefully, and it had worked. Some days, there were fifteen kids here, eating their way through her snack provisions like locusts. But she knew where her children were and she knew they were safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, as she unlocked the great room\u2019s series of wood-framed pocket doors and opened them wide, she could hear movement upstairs; the floors groaned and footsteps thudded through the house.</p><p>For once, Mia wasn\u2019t hiding out from all that horseplay in the media room, she wasn\u2019t locked in her bedroom, watching The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast or another of her Disney comfort movies. She was out on the beach, sitting on the sandy edge with Lexi beside her. A heavy woolen blanket wrapped them together; black and blond hair tangled together in the salty air. They\u2019d been sitting out there for hours, talking.</p><p>Just the sight of it, of her daughter talking to a friend, made Jude smile. She had waited so long for this, hoped for it so fervently, and yet now that it had happened, she couldn\u2019t help worrying just a little. Mia was so fragile, so needy; it was too easy to hurt her. And after the thing with Haley, Mia couldn\u2019t take another friend\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>Jude needed to learn a little bit about Lexi, just to know who her daughter was hanging out with. It was a parenting choice that had yielded good results over the years. The more she knew about her kids\u2019 lives, the better mother she could be to them. She stepped out onto the patio. The breeze immediately plucked at her hair, whipped strands across her face. Without bothering to step into any of the shoes that lay cluttered outside the door, she walked barefooted across the flagstones, past the collection of dark, woven outdoor furniture. At the edge between the grass and the sand, a giant cedar tree rose tall and straight into the pellucid blue sky. As she approached the girls, she heard Mia say, \u201cI want to try out for the school play, but I know I won\u2019t get a part. Sarah and Joeley always get the leads.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was totally scared to talk to you today,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t? It\u2019s no good to be afraid of stuff. You should go for it.\u201d</p><p>Mia turned to Lexi. \u201cWould you come with me to tryouts? The other theater kids ... they\u2019re so serious. They don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded, her face solemn with understanding. \u201cI\u2019ll come. Definitely.\u201d</p><p>Jude stopped beside her daughter. \u201cHey, girls.\u201d She put a hand on Mia\u2019s slim shoulder.</p><p>Mia grinned up at her. \u201cI\u2019m going to try out for Once upon a Mattress. Lexi\u2019s gonna come with me. I probably won\u2019t get a part, but...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Jude said, pleased by this development. \u201cWell. I better take Lexi home now. Your dad will be home in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come with?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. You have a paper due on Friday. You might as well get started on it,\u201d Jude answered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already checking the Web site? It\u2019s the first day of school,\u201d Mia said, her shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cYou need to stay on track. Grades matter in high school.\u201d She looked down at Lexi. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take the bus,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to drive me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bus?\u201d Jude frowned. In all her years of parenting on this island, she had never had a child make that offer. Most said they could call their moms; none ever offered to take the bus. Where would one even catch a bus around here?</p><p>Lexi unwound herself from the red and white striped wool blanket. When she stood up, it slumped to the sand. \u201cReally, Mrs. Farraday. You don\u2019t need to drive me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lexi, call me Jude. When you say Mrs. Farraday, I think of my mother and that\u2019s not a good thing. Mia, go tell Zach I\u2019m starting the drive. Ask him who else needs a ride.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jude started up the Escalade. Five kids shoved their way into the plush interior, talking over one another as they buckled up their seatbelts. In the front passenger seat, Lexi sat quietly, staring straight ahead. Jude admonished Zach and Mia to start on their homework and then drove away. The route was so familiar she could have driven it in her sleep\u2014left on Beach Drive, right on Night Road, left on the highway. At the top of Viewcrest, she pulled into her best friend\u2019s driveway. \u201cHere you go, Bryson. Tell Molly we\u2019re still on for lunch this week.\u201d</p><p>He mumbled some kind of answer and got out of the car. For the next twenty minutes, she drove the standard route around the island, letting off one kid after another. Finally, she turned to Lexi. \u201cOkay, hon, where to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bus stop?\u201d</p><p>Jude smiled. \u201cI am not putting you on a bus. Now, where to, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPort George,\u201d Lexi said.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jude said, surprised. Most of the kids at Pine High lived on the island, and, really, the other side of the bridge was a whole different world. Geographically, only about three hundred feet separated Pine Island from Port George, but there were many ways to calculate distance. Port George was where nice, upstanding boys from Pine Island went to buy beer and cigarettes at the minimart, using fake IDs they made on old magic cards. There was all kinds of trouble in the schools there. She drove out to the highway and headed off the island.</p><p>\u201cTurn there,\u201d Lexi said about a mile from the bridge. \u201cIn fact, you can let me out here. I can walk the rest of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Jude followed the signs to the Chief Sealth Mobile Home Park. From there, Lexi directed her down a winding road to a tiny plot of land, overgrown with weeds and grass, where a fading yellow double-wide sat on concrete blocks. The front door was an ugly shade of blue and cracked up the middle, and the curtains inside were ragged and unevenly hemmed. Rust inched like caterpillars along the seams. Deep, muddy ruts in the grass showed where a car was usually parked.</p><p>Jude parked at the edge of the grass and turned off the engine. This was hardly what she\u2019d expected. \u201cIs your mom home? I hate to just drop you off. I\u2019d actually like to meet her.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked at Jude. \u201cMy mom died three years ago. I live with my Aunt Eva now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Jude said. She knew how it had felt to lose a parent\u2014her father had died when Jude was seven. The world had become a dark and frightening place, and for years she\u2019d been unsure of her place in it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that. I know how difficult it must be for you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived with your aunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days? But ... where were you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoster care,\u201d Lexi said quietly, sighing. \u201cMy mom was a heroin addict. Sometimes we lived in our car. So I guess you don\u2019t want me hanging around with Mia anymore. I understand. Really. I wish my mom had cared who I hung out with.\u201d</p><p>Jude frowned. None of this was what she\u2019d expected. It did worry her, all of it, but she didn\u2019t want to be that kind of woman, the kind who judged a person by his or her circumstance. And right now Lexi looked as beaten as any teenager Jude had ever seen. Everything about the girl radiated defeat; no doubt she\u2019d been disappointed a lot in her life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like my mom,\u201d Lexi said earnestly. The need in the girl\u2019s blue eyes was unmistakable.</p><p>Jude believed her, but still, there was potential danger here. Mia was fragile, easily led astray. Jude couldn\u2019t simply ignore that, no matter how sorry she felt for this girl. \u201cI\u2019m not like my mother, either. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia is shy. I\u2019m sure you already know that. She doesn\u2019t make friends easily and she worries too much about being liked. She\u2019s always been that way. And last year, she had her heart broken. Not by a boy. It was worse than that. A girl\u2014Haley\u2014befriended her. For a few months, they were inseparable. Mia was as happy as I\u2019ve ever seen her. But the truth was that Haley had her sights set on Zach, and he fell into her trap. He didn\u2019t know how it would upset Mia. Anyway, Haley dumped Mia for Zach, and when Zach lost interest, Haley refused to come to the house anymore. Mia was so hurt she stopped talking for almost a month. I was really worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess ... because if you\u2019re going to be her friend, she needs to know she can count on you. I\u2019d like to know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything to hurt her,\u201d Lexi promised.</p><p>Jude thought of all the dangers this friendship could pose to her daughter, and all the benefits, and she weighed them, as if this decision were hers to make, although she knew it wasn\u2019t. A fourteen-year-old girl could make her own friends. But Jude could make it easy for Mia and Lexi to stay friends, or difficult. What was best for Mia?</p><p>When she looked at Lexi, the answer came easily. Jude was a mother, first, last, and always. And her daughter desperately needed a friend. \u201cI\u2019m taking Mia into the city on Saturday for manicures. A girls\u2019 day. Would you like to join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a job yet. Money\u2019s tight. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy treat,\u201d Jude said easily, \u201cand I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>2003</p><p>The last three years had both worn Jude down and sharpened her. She hadn\u2019t known how terrifying life could be until the first time she handed Zach and Mia car keys and watched them drive away. From that moment on, she\u2019d begun to be afraid for her kids. Everything scared her. Rain. Wind. Snow. Darkness. Loud music. Other drivers. Too many kids in a car.</p><p>She\u2019d issued her kids cell phones and instituted rules. Curfews. Accountability. Honesty.</p><p>She paced when they were minutes late and didn\u2019t breathe easily until they were safely in bed. She\u2019d thought that was the worst of it, the freedom that came with a driver\u2019s license, but now she knew better.</p><p>It had all been a prelude to this: senior year of high school. The semester had just begun, and already it was a pressure cooker, a Rubik\u2019s Cube of deadlines and paperwork. College loomed on the horizon like a nuclear cloud, tainting every breath of air. Years of driving back and forth to sporting events, practices, play rehearsals, and performances was nothing compared with this.</p><p>On the wall above her desk she had two giant calendars, one marked ZACH and the other MIA. Every college deadline was written in red ink; every test date was in bold-face type. Jude had spent years studying admission statistics and reading about the various universities, gauging which would be best for her kids.</p><p>Getting into college would be a cakewalk for Zach. He had entered senior year with a 3.96 GPA and a perfect SAT score. He could go almost anywhere he wanted.</p><p>Mia was a different story. Her grades were good but not great; same with her SAT. Even so, she had set her heart on the prestigious University of Southern California drama school.</p><p>Jude had begun to lose sleep about it all. She lay in bed at night, going though admission statistics and criteria in her head until she felt sick. She was constantly figuring out how to make her daughter\u2019s dream come true. It wasn\u2019t easy to get one kid into an ultracompetitive school, and Jude needed to get two in. The twins had to go to college together; any other outcome was unthinkable. Mia needed her brother beside her.</p><p>And now, as if all that pressure weren\u2019t bad enough, the word she\u2019d been dreading had just been said aloud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Party.</p><p>Jude drew in a deep and steadying breath.</p><p>She was seated at the dinner table, with her family gathered around her. It was a Friday night in early October; the sky was the color of bruised plums.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Zach said from his place at the table. \u201cCan we go or not? Molly and Tim are letting Bryson go.\u201d</p> <p>Mia was beside her brother. Her blond hair had been braided wet and dried into crimpy zigzags. In the past three years, she had blossomed into a true beauty, with flawless skin and a smile that was marquee bright. Her friendship with Lexi had stayed as true as magnetic North, and it had given Mia a new confidence. Her daughter still wasn\u2019t brave or extremely social, but she was happy, and that meant the world to Jude. \u201cWhat about you, Mia? Do you want to go to this party?\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cZach wants to go.\u201d</p><p>It was the answer Jude had expected. They were a pair, these two, in every way. Where one went, the other followed; it had been that way from the moment of their birth and probably before. One could hardly breathe without the other.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that, Miles?\u201d Jude said. \u201cThe kids want to go to a party at Kevin Eisner\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem with that?\u201d Miles asked, pouring hollandaise sauce on his grilled asparagus.</p> <p>\u201cThe Eisners are in Paris, if I\u2019m not mistaken,\u201d Jude said, seeing the twins flinch in unison. \u201cSmall island,\u201d she reminded them.</p><p>\u201cKevin\u2019s aunt is there, though,\u201d Zach said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like no adult is around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d Mia added, nodding.</p><p>Jude sat back. She\u2019d known this moment was coming, of course. She\u2019d been a teenager herself, and senior year was the Holy Grail of teenhood. So, she knew what it meant when seniors wanted to \u201cparty.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had endless conversations with the kids about alcohol, told them repeatedly how dangerous it could be, and they swore not to be interested in drinking, but she wasn\u2019t a fool. Neither was she the kind of woman who pretended her children were perfect. What mattered to her was protecting them from the risks associated with adolescence, even those of their own making.</p><p>She could say no. But they might defy her, and wouldn\u2019t they be more in danger then? \u201cI\u2019ll call Kevin\u2019s aunt,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cMake sure an adult is supervising the party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Mia whined, \u201cway to totally humiliate us. We\u2019re not children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Mom,\u201d Zach said. \u201cYou know you can trust us. I\u2019d never drink and drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer it if you\u2019d promise never to drink,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cI might drink one beer. It won\u2019t kill me. You want me to lie to you? I thought that wasn\u2019t how we rolled in this family.\u201d</p><p>Her own words thrown back at her, and with deadly accuracy. The price for honesty with your kids was that often you learned what you\u2019d rather not. The way Jude saw it, there were two parenting choices: ask for honesty and try to roll with unwanted truths or stick your head in the sand and be lied to. Zach\u2019s honesty was a reason to trust him. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said in a forceful enough voice to end the conversation.</p><p>The rest of the meal passed quickly. As soon as they cleared the table, the kids put the dishes in the dishwasher and then ran upstairs.</p><p>Jude knew they were getting ready for the party. They assumed victory\u2014she\u2019d seen it in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said to Miles. They stood side by side at the picture window, staring out at the darkening night. The Sound had turned graphite and the sky was a deep bronze color. \u201cHow do we stop them from drinking and keep them safe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChaining them to a wall would work. Too bad the state frowns on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop them from drinking\u2014you know that. If not tonight, then some night they\u2019ll get drunk. That\u2019s just the way it is. So, what do we do to protect them? Maybe we should have a party here. We could take the kids\u2019 keys and make sure everyone stayed safe. We could make sure they don\u2019t drink too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. No. We\u2019d be risking everything we own. Not to mention, if someone got hurt, we\u2019d be responsible. And you know teenagers, they\u2019re like bacteria. They multiply too fast to see and you can\u2019t keep them in your sights. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even suggest it.\u201d</p><p>Jude knew he was right, but it didn\u2019t help. \u201cDo you remember high school? Because I sure do. Keggers at Morrow Farm were a weekly occurrence. And we drove home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to trust them, Jude. Let them start making some decisions. Mia\u2019s smart, and she sure as hell isn\u2019t a party girl. And Zach would never let anything bad happen to her. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Jude nodded, thinking it all through for the thousandth time. There seemed to her to be no good answer. No indisputably right way to go.</p><p>For the rest of the evening, Jude wrestled with the question of how to be the best parent in this situation. She was still trying to figure it out at nine o\u2019clock when the kids came running down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Zach said.</p><p>She looked at her kids. Zach, so tall and handsome and steady in his low-rise jeans and striped American Eagle sweatshirt, and Mia, in tattered blue jean capris, white T-shirt, and blue silk men\u2019s tie, knotted off to the side. She had her hair drawn back in a ponytail that geysered at the top of her head. She\u2019d come out of her shell since meeting Lexi, but she was still fragile, a little needy. She could get her heart broken so easily, could make the wrong decision because she was afraid of being laughed at.</p><p>They were good kids. Honest kids who cared about their futures. They\u2019d never given Jude any reason to mistrust them.</p><p>\u201cMadre?\u201d Zach said, smiling, reaching for her hand. \u201cCome on. You know you can trust us.\u201d</p><p>Jude knew he was manipulating her, using her love to his advantage, but she was helpless to resist. She loved them both so much and she wanted them to be happy. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cThis is like the witch trials. Can we go or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe said we won\u2019t drink,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Miles came up beside Jude, slipped an arm around her waist. \u201cWe can count on your word, then?\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s face split into a huge smile. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour curfew is midnight,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cMidnight?\u201d Zach said. \u201cThat\u2019s so lame. Like we\u2019re middle schoolers. Come on, Mom. Dad?\u201d</p><p>Miles said \u201cMidnight,\u201d at the same time Jude said, \u201cOne o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>Zach and Mia surged at her, drew her into a fierce hug.</p><p>\u201cStay safe,\u201d Jude said nervously. \u201cIf there\u2019s any trouble, call me. I mean it. If you drink\u2014and you shouldn\u2019t\u2014but if you do, call home. Your dad and I will pick you up, and any of your friends. I mean it. No questions asked, no getting in trouble. I promise. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Mia said. \u201cYou\u2019ve told us for years.\u201d</p><p>And with that, they were off, running for the sporty white Mustang she and Miles had bought for them last year.</p><p>\u201cYou should have held firm at midnight,\u201d Miles said when the car door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. It was so easy for him. When Miles said no, they gave up. When she said no, they tried harder, boring through her resolve like boll weevils through corn, until there was nothing left between them and what they wanted.</p><p>Miles frowned as the red taillights of Zach\u2019s car disappeared into the darkness. \u201cSenior year isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jude said. Already she regretted the decision to let them go. There were so many things that could go wrong ...</p><p>On a warm autumn night like this, Amor\u00e9 was packed with customers. Summer was ending and everyone, locals and tourists alike, knew the cold season was moving their way.</p><p>Lexi had worked part-time at this ice cream shop since sophomore year. Every penny she earned went into her college fund. She and her boss, Mrs. Solter\u2014a sixty-year-old widow with steel gray hair and a penchant for layering beaded necklaces\u2014worked the counter in perfect synchronicity, one ringing sales while the other scooped ice cream.</p><p>Tonight, even though the place was busy, Lexi kept watching the clock. The party at the Eisners\u2019 place started at nine, and Mia and Zach were picking her up.</p><p>Zach.</p><p>He was the only fly in the ointment of her new life. In the past three years, Lexi had found a place where she belonged. Aunt Eva cared for her deeply; it was obvious, even though the woman wasn\u2019t demonstrative. Mia had become Lexi\u2019s other half, her sister. They were inseparable. And the Farradays had welcomed Lexi into their family with open arms, never judging her. Jude had become like a mother to her, so much so that on Mother\u2019s Day, Lexi always bought two cards\u2014one for Eva and one for Jude. She always wrote thanks across the white space.</p><p>Only Zach held back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like Lexi. That was all there was to it. He never stayed in a room alone with her longer than was absolutely necessary, and he hardly ever spoke to her. When he did say something to her, he looked away, as if he couldn\u2019t stand making eye contact. Lexi didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d done to offend him, and no amount of reparations had helped. The worst part was that it hurt her feelings every time. Every time he looked away or walked away, she felt a little pinch of loss.</p><p>But it was a good thing; that was what she told herself. It was good that he didn\u2019t like her because she liked him too much. And one thing she knew for sure, had known from the beginning: Zach Farraday was off-limits.</p><p>At just past nine, she heard the Mustang drive up outside. She whipped off her multicolored apron and ran to the employees\u2019 bathroom for her purse. Snagging it off the wall, she glanced in the mirror just long enough to see that her makeup was still okay, and then headed for the front door, waving to Mrs. Solter as she passed.</p><p>\u201cBe good,\u201d Mrs. Solter said with a happy little wave.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Lexi promised. She ran out to the Mustang and climbed into the backseat. The stereo was blaring so loudly that no one could talk.</p><p>Zach backed out of the parking stall and headed out of town. In no time at all, they were turning onto a long gravel driveway. At its end sat a quaint yellow Victorian, with a pitched shake roof and a big white wraparound porch. Lights hung from the eaves, illuminating baskets of flowers.</p><p>When they got out of the car, Lexi could hear the distant buzz of conversation and the music, but there were very few kids visible. They were probably down at the beach, where the neighbors were less likely to see them and thus less likely to complain to the local police.</p><p>Zach came around the car and stood by Lexi. She tried to act casual. As usual, she couldn\u2019t manage it. She turned slightly and caught him staring down at her.</p><p>Before she could think of anything cool to say, Mia came up beside Lexi, held her hand. \u201cWill Tyler be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Zach answered. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, walking off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi and Mia followed him through the tall grass. When they reached the front yard, they saw the party. There were probably seventy-five kids in the yard; most were gathered around the fire. The sweet smell of pot filled the air.</p><p>Mia grasped Lexi\u2019s hand, yanked her to a stop. \u201cThere he is. How do I look?\u201d</p><p>Lexi scanned the crowd until she saw Tyler Marshall. He was a tall, gangly kid with skateboarder hair who wore his baggy pants so low on his hips he was constantly yanking them up. Mia had had a crush on him since the end of junior year.</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful. Go talk to him,\u201d Lexi said.</p> <p>Mia\u2019s cheeks turned bright red. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Lexi said, squeezing Mia\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Zach Attack?\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Zach shrugged, and the three of them walked deeper into the party. They made their way past a pair of silver kegs and walked up to Tyler.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mia,\u201d Tyler said, giving her a bright grin. He held out a half-empty bottle. Raspberry vodka.</p> <p>Mia reached for the bottle and took a drink before Lexi could even react.</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes me the designated driver,\u201d Zach said. Then he added, \u201cBe careful, Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna walk on the beach?\u201d Tyler asked Mia.</p><p>Mia gave Lexi a wow look and followed Tyler toward the beach.</p><p>Lexi was acutely aware of Zach beside her. He stood there, saying nothing, and yet she felt something in the quiet between them. Unable to help herself, she turned and looked up at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know how to answer. There seemed to be something going on she didn\u2019t understand. She wished she\u2019d never asked the stupid question in the first place.</p><p>\u201cLexi\u2014\u201d he started.</p><p>Amanda Martin appeared in front of them as if by magic, holding a half-empty pint of Captain Morgan spiced rum. She was a leggy redhead with full lips and eyes that slanted gypsylike. Zach\u2019s latest girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d she purred. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d She wrapped her arms around him and melted against him.</p><p>Lexi watched them walk away, all tangled together\u2014he was kissing Amanda now\u2014and felt a familiar sense of disappointment. Sighing, she wandered down to the beach. There, she met up with some of the kids from the drama club. For years, Lexi had been hanging out with these kids, watching them all rehearse with Mia. They sat around on the sand, talking. Of course, college came up. It was the big topic these days. From the very start of senior year, they\u2019d been talking about deadlines and applications and admission stats. Every day, another university representative was in the library, talking to any senior who was interested. Weekend campus visits were becoming the norm. And the students from Pine Island didn\u2019t just go to downtown Seattle to check out schools. Oh, no. Their parents flew them all over the country.</p><p>\u201cLexster!\u201d Mia\u2019s voice rose above the noise.</p><p>Lexi turned and saw Mia lurching toward her.</p><p>\u201cI doan know how I got this drunk,\u201d Mia said, swaying dangerously. \u201cLexi, how did I get this drunk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrinking, maybe?\u201d Lexi got up and put a steadying arm around Mia.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lexi,\u201d Mia whispered, but it was a drunk\u2019s whisper, stagey and slurred. She put an arm around Lexi. \u201cYou \u2019n Zach Attack are my bess friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, too.\u201d</p><p>Mia slumped to a sit on the cold sand. When Lexi joined her, they leaned together. \u201cTyler said I\u2019m pretty,\u201d Mia said. \u201cDo you think he means it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be a fool not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe danced,\u201d Mia said, her voice dreamy. She swayed for a moment and then went still. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my lips. Are my lips still there?\u201d</p><p>Lexi burst out laughing. \u201cI think we better get you home. Let\u2019s go find Zach.\u201d</p><p>Lexi helped Mia to her feet and led her friend through the crowd. They found Zach in the shadows by the side of the house. Amanda was throwing herself at him. At least Lexi thought she was.</p><p>\u201cZach?\u201d Lexi dared. \u201cMia\u2019s not in good shape. I think she needs to go home.\u201d</p><p>At that, Mia doubled over and vomited into the grass.</p><p>Zach rushed to Mia\u2019s side. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, putting an arm around her.</p><p>Mia swayed unsteadily, wiping her mouth. \u201cI doan feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmanda?\u201d Zach said. \u201cCan she stay at your house? I can\u2019t bring her home like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d Amanda said, making a sour face. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving the party this early. It\u2019s barely midnight.\u201d She gave Zach a long kiss and then walked away, flipping her hair as she headed back toward the keg.</p><p>\u201cMia can spend the night at my house,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cEva will be asleep by now.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at her. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Zach guided Mia back to the Mustang and put her in the backseat. It was like trying to make cooked spaghetti stand, and by the time he was finished, Mia was laughing uproariously and spread out across the seat. Snapping her seatbelt in place took forever.</p><p>Lexi got into the passenger seat while Zach started the engine. He backed up slowly and drove out to the main road.</p><p>As they sped down the highway toward the bridge, his fingers tapped out a rhythm on the leather-covered steering wheel. The music coming through the stereo was unfamiliar to Lexi, but its beat was strangely addictive. Mia was humming in the backseat, out of tune, as usual.</p><p>At the trailer, Lexi got out of the car, and Mia was right behind her, stumbling out, laughing as she fell to her knees in the damp grass. \u201cLess go to our hill,\u201d she said, staggering back to her feet.</p><p>Zach rushed to his sister\u2019s side, held her up. \u201cHey, Mia,\u201d he said gently, \u201cmaybe you should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled drunkenly. \u201cYeah. Tha would be good.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at Lexi. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s in bed to leave, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that. I know you want to get back to Amanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I want.\u201d</p><p>Stung, Lexi went to Mia, took her from Zach. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Mia.\u201d She guided her best friend across the damp grass and up into the mobile home. In the living room, Mia collapsed to the floor, giggling and moaning. \u201cSshh,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll jus sleep for a sec...\u201d</p><p>Lexi left Mia on the carpeted floor for a minute and went back outside. From the porch, she stared at Zach. Slowly, she moved toward him. He was looking at her now, watching her even, and his attention made something in the pit of her stomach flutter. \u201cS-she\u2019s fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your hill?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMia and I hang out there. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was aware of his footsteps cracking on twigs and branches as they pushed their way through the heavy salal and brush. The path was so thin you could only find it if you knew where it was. When she emerged into the open again, it was onto a high bluff of untended land that overlooked a busy strip of the highway, the glittering casino, and the black Sound beyond. \u201cI come out here all the time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool.\u201d Zach sat down on the soft ground.</p><p>Lexi reluctantly sat beside him. They were so close she could feel his leg against hers.</p><p>She waited for him to say something, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Silence stretched out, turned uncomfortable. \u201cSo you guys are checking out colleges next weekend. That\u2019s cool,\u201d Lexi finally said. It was all she could think of.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound very excited about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia says she\u2019ll die if we don\u2019t go to USC together. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want to go to school with her, too, and I want to be a doctor like the old man, but...\u201d He looked out over the casino and sighed.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, caught her looking at him. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t cut it?\u201d he said so quietly she barely heard his voice above the distant drone of highway noise.</p><p>She had known Zach for more than three years now, adoring him from a distance; she\u2019d studied him like an archaeologist, culling through his words for hidden meaning. And never had he said anything like this to her. He sounded vulnerable and confused.</p><p>The night seemed to fall quiet; the buzz of the cars faded. All Lexi could hear was the beating of her heart and the even strains of their breathing. She was reminded of all the times she\u2019d waited for her mother\u2019s return, only to be disappointed, discarded. If there was one emotion she understood profoundly, it was uncertainty. Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined that Zach could feel the same way. It made her feel connected to him, in tune. For one split second, he wasn\u2019t Mia\u2019s brother; he was the boy she\u2019d seen on that first day of school, the one who\u2019d made her heart speed up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were ever afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m afraid of something.\u201d He leaned the slightest bit toward her. Maybe he was just shifting his seat on the hard dirt; she didn\u2019t know\u2014she just knew how it felt to be afraid, and the way he was looking at her made it hard to breathe. Without really thinking, just feeling, she leaned toward him for a kiss.</p><p>She was just about to close her eyes when he jerked back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The magnitude of what she\u2019d almost done knocked the breath from her. He didn\u2019t even like her, and, worse than that, he wasn\u2019t available for her. Jude had made that clear; so had Mia. And Mia was what mattered, not some useless, baseless crush on a boy who fell in love with a different girl every week.</p><p>Horrified, she mumbled an apology, got to her feet, and started running through the brambles and bushes for the relative safety of her mobile home.</p><p>\u201cLexi, wait!\u201d</p><p>She ran into the mobile home and slammed the door shut behind her. Mia lay at her feet, singing a song from The Little Mermaid.</p><p>Lexi stepped over her best friend and peeked out from between the curtains.</p><p>Zach stood there a long time, staring at the closed door. Then he finally went back to his car and started it up.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Lexi had brushed her teeth and put on her pajamas and crawled into bed with Mia that she let herself really think about what she\u2019d almost done.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, Lexi Baill,\u201d she said into the quiet.</p><p>\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d Mia said; then she started to snore.</p><p>The next morning, Lexi stood at her bedroom window, staring out at the falling rain, feeling sick to her stomach. She couldn\u2019t believe that she\u2019d almost kissed Zach last night.</p><p>What an idiot.</p><p>What should she do now? Tell Mia the truth, throw herself on her best friend\u2019s mercy and apologize for a moment of lunacy? But what if it ruined everything? And Zach would never tell. Or would he? Did he hate Lexi that much?</p><p>\u201cI feel like crap.\u201d</p><p>Lexi heard the mattress creak against the wood-slatted bed frame. There was a pinging sound as Mia maneuvered to a sit. Lexi turned slowly around, feeling a fresh wave of shame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia pushed the tangled blond hair out of her eyes, which were a little dazed looking, unfocused. A red scratch marred one pale cheek. Lexi had no idea how Mia had gotten the injury. No doubt Mia didn\u2019t either. \u201cMan,\u201d she said. \u201cI got roasted last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d Lexi went back to the bed and climbed in beside her best friend.</p><p>Mia leaned against her. \u201cThanks for taking care of me. I swear I didn\u2019t drink that much.\u201d She banged her head back against the wall. \u201cGod, I hope my mom doesn\u2019t hear about this.\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t take it; the truth was corroding her from the inside out. She had to be a good friend to Mia. She had to be. \u201cSpeaking of last night. I did a really stup\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Mia sat up suddenly. \u201cTyler asked me to the homecoming dance.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stopped. \u201cWhat?\u201d She and Mia usually hung out together on dance nights. Neither one of them had been asked to any of the dances last year. She felt vaguely jealous that this time she\u2019d be sitting out the dance while Mia was having fun.</p><p>\u201cYou can come with us. Really. It\u2019d be a blast. We could triple date with Amanda and Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. No. And about Zach...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Mia kicked back the covers and got out of bed. She stood there, a little unsteady on her feet, looking around the room for her pants.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the dryer. You puked on them last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d Mia padded out of the bedroom and headed down the hallway. The trailer shuddered at the weight of her steps.</p><p>Lexi followed Mia, stood in the hall while her friend slipped back into her jeans. She was about to bring up Zach again when Eva came out of her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eva,\u201d Mia said with an obviously forced smile. \u201cThanks for letting me spend the night last night.\u201d</p><p>Eva said, \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome. Did you have fun last night?\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled again, but it was ragged; her skin was a little gray. \u201cWe did. It was great.\u201d She put an arm around Lexi. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without Lexi. She\u2019s the best friend ever.\u201d</p> <p>Outside, a car horn honked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be my mom,\u201d Mia said. \u201cShe texted me last night. We\u2019re going to visit my grandmother today. I better go.\u201d</p><p>Lexi followed Mia to the front door. In her mind, she blurted out her secret several times, and they laughed about it; in truth, she said nothing, just stared at Mia\u2019s long blond hair.</p><p>At the front door, Mia hugged her fiercely. \u201cThanks, Lexi. I mean it.\u201d She drew back, looking a little uncertain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you know. I shouldn\u2019t have lost it like that. You\u2019ll come to the dance with Ty and me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m not lame enough already,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. We\u2019ll have a blast.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the car horn honked again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so OCD,\u201d Mia said, opening the door.</p> <p>The white Mustang was parked out front, its engine purring, exhaust melting into the fog.</p><p>Zach got out of the car and stood there, staring at Lexi over the Mustang\u2019s white roof. Rain pelted his face, made him blink.</p><p>Mia flung her hoodie over her head and ran down to the car, getting in.</p><p>Lexi was certain she saw Zach shake his head slightly, as if to say, it never happened ... it can\u2019t happen. Then he got back into his car.</p><p>Lexi watched them drive away, then went back into the trailer, closing the door behind her. He didn\u2019t want her to tell Mia. Was that what he\u2019d meant?</p><p>Eva sat at the kitchen table, her hands cupped around her mug. \u201cHis car woke me up last night,\u201d she said, looking up. \u201cSo I went to the window. I din\u2019t expect you to come home.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tried to imagine the scene Eva had witnessed: Lexi practically carrying Mia up the stairs; Mia collapsing on the floor, singing. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be staying at the Farradays\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I know why you din\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sat down across from Eva. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, too ashamed to make eye contact. Aunt Eva would be disappointed in her now, maybe she\u2019d even wonder if Lexi was like her mother after all.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drink anything, if that\u2019s what you think. I saw ... my mom drink, so I\u2019m...\u201d She shrugged. There was no way to put all of that emotion into a few careful words. \u201cI didn\u2019t drink anything.\u201d</p><p>Eva reached across the table and took hold of Lexi\u2019s hands. \u201cI\u2019m no warden, Alexa. You wouldn\u2019t know it to look at me, but I remember what it\u2019s like to be young, and I know how the world works. A girl can get in real trouble when she\u2019s in that condition. She can make a bad decision. I would hate for you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you know. And one more thing: Mia and her brother aren\u2019t like you. Those two got choices you don\u2019t. They\u2019ll get breaks you won\u2019t. You understand me?\u201d</p><p>Lexi knew that; she\u2019d known it from the first time she walked in the Farraday house. Mia could afford to make mistakes. Lexi couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Eva looked at her. \u201cAnd about that boy. I seen the way he ran after you. You be careful there, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>Eva studied her carefully. Lexi wondered what she saw. \u201cYou just be careful around him.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Jude loved her garden in October. It was a time of organization, of planning for the future. She lost herself in the work of planting bulbs, imagining how each choice would alter the garden next spring. And she needed that now, to find a kind of peace.</p><p>The past five days had been stressful for her, although she couldn\u2019t exactly say why. She hadn\u2019t wanted the kids to go to the party, but they had, and it had gone uneventfully. Zach had come home right on time, and she\u2019d hugged him tightly (smelling his breath) and sent him to bed. She\u2019d seen no evidence of drinking, and Mia had spent the night with Lexi and come home smiling the next day. Apparently, nothing had gone wrong. So why did she think something had? Maybe Miles was right, and she was seeing problems where none existed.</p><p>She sat back on her heels and clapped her hands together to release the dirt clinging to her gloves. Tiny black particles rained down, creating a lacy pattern on her thighs.</p><p>She was just about to reach for the clippers lying in the dirt beside her when she heard a car. She looked up, tented a gloved hand across her eyes, and saw sunlight glint off the silver hood of a brand new Mercedes.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d she muttered. She\u2019d forgotten about the time.</p><p>The car pulled up in front of the low stone wall that outlined her front garden.</p><p>Jude pulled off her dirt-caked gloves and stood up as her mother got out of the car. \u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Caroline Everson walked around her bullet car and into the vibrant garden with the bearing of an ice pick. She was dressed, as always, winter or summer, in a pair of black wool pants and a fitted blouse that showcased her toned, fit body. Her white hair was drawn back from her angular face; the severity of the style offset her bottle-green eyes to perfection. At seventy, she was still a beautiful woman. And successful; that was what mattered to Caro. Success. \u201cHave you agreed to be on the garden tour yet?\u201d</p><p>Jude wished she\u2019d never revealed that little dream to her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s not ready yet. Soon, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ready? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Jude heard the derisiveness in her mother\u2019s tone and tried not to let it wound her. Caroline saw no point in hobbies. The end game was what mattered to her mother, and until Jude showed this garden on the island tour, she would somehow be a failure. \u201cCome inside, Mother. Lunch is ready.\u201d Without waiting for a response, Jude led the way toward the front door. On the porch, she slipped out of her gardening clogs, brushed the dirt off her pants, and then went inside.</p><p>Sunlight poured through the home\u2019s twenty-foot-tall windows, made the exotic wood floors glow like burnished copper. An immense granite fireplace dominated the great room, which was decorated in soothing neutrals. The real star of this room was the view: soaring glass panels captured a swatch of emerald grass, a layer of steel blue Sound, and the distant Olympic Mountains.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you a glass of wine?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Her mother set down her purse so carefully it might have held explosives. \u201cOf course. Chardonnay, if you have it.\u201d</p><p>Jude was glad for the excuse to leave the room. She passed through the dining area, created by a long bird\u2019s-eye maple table and ten chairs, to the open kitchen beyond. The only time she couldn\u2019t see her mother was when she opened the wood-paneled door of the Sub-Zero refrigerator.</p><p>When she returned to the great room, her mother was standing at the end of the sofa, looking up at the huge canvas that hung above the fireplace. It was a gorgeous, abstract work of art\u2014swiping, curling streams of amber and red and black that somehow managed to convey a buoyant happiness. Mother had painted it decades ago, and Jude still had trouble reconciling the work\u2019s glorious optimism with the woman standing in front of it now.</p><p>\u201cYou should replace that piece. The gallery has some lovely work now,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Jude said simply, and it was true. This piece had been her father\u2019s favorite\u2014she remembered standing with him as a little girl, her small hand tucked in his bear-paw grasp, watching Mother paint it. Look at the way she does that, it\u2019s magic, he\u2019d said, and for a time Jude had believed it, believed there was a kind of magic in their home. \u201cI remember watching you paint it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifetime ago,\u201d her mother said, turning her back on the painting. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go clean up? I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Jude handed her mother the glass of wine and then left the room. She took a quick shower and changed into a pair of comfortable jeans and a black V-necked sweater and returned to the great room, where her mother was seated on the sofa, her spine straight, sipping at the wine like a hummingbird.</p><p>Jude sat opposite her mother. A large stone coffee table separated them. \u201cLunch is ready anytime you\u2019re hungry,\u201d Jude said. \u201cI\u2019ve made us a Waldorf salad.\u201d</p><p>At that, they lapsed into their usual silence. Jude couldn\u2019t help wondering why they continued this pretense. Once a month, they met for a meal\u2014trading locations back and forth as if it mattered where they were. During a lunch of healthy food and expensive wine, they pretended to have something to talk about, a relationship.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the article in The Seattle Times? The one about the gallery?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You sent it to me. You said how important motherhood is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNannies notwithstanding.\u201d</p><p>Mother sighed. \u201cOh, Judith Anne. Not that old whine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right,\u201d Jude said, and not because it was the only response that would end the conversation. It was true. Jude was forty-six years old. She should have forgiven her mother by now. Then again, her mother had never asked for forgiveness, never thought it necessary, even though she\u2019d checked out of motherhood as if it had been a cheap motel. Fast and in the middle of the night. Jude had been seven years old and suddenly upended by grief, and yet, after her father\u2019s funeral, no one had thought to reach out for her, certainly not her own mother, who went back to work the very next day. In all the years that came after, her mother had never stopped working. She\u2019d given up painting and become one of the most successful gallery owners in Seattle. She nurtured young artists while entrusting her daughter\u2019s care to one nanny after another. They\u2019d had no relationship whatsoever until about five years ago, when Caroline had called and scheduled lunch. Now, once a month, they pretended. Jude didn\u2019t even know why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow are the children?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Jude said. \u201cZach\u2019s grades are phenomenal and Mia has become a talented actress. Daddy would have been proud of her.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed. It didn\u2019t surprise Jude, that small exhalation of breath. Dad as a topic was off-limits. Jude had been a daddy\u2019s girl; neither one of them wanted to acknowledge that now, all these years after his death, although Jude still missed him and his bear hugs. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right,\u201d her mother said, smiling tightly. \u201cI assume Zach can go to any school he wants. I hope he continues with his plans to become a doctor. It would be a shame if he quit his studies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s another reminder that I quit law school. I was pregnant and Miles was in medical school. We hardly had a choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lost the baby,\u201d her mother said, as if that was what mattered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jude said quietly, remembering. She\u2019d been young and in love, and honestly, for most of her life, she\u2019d been afraid of motherhood, afraid that she would discover in herself some genetic anomaly that had been passed down from Caroline. She and Miles had gotten pregnant accidentally\u2014too soon, when they weren\u2019t ready\u2014and Jude had discovered from the inception how profoundly she could love. The very idea of motherhood had transformed her.</p><p>\u201cYou have always loved your children too much. You care too much about making them happy.\u201d</p><p>Parenting advice from her mother. Perfect. Jude smiled thinly. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to love your children too much. Although I wouldn\u2019t really expect you to understand that.\u201d</p><p>Her mother flinched. \u201cJudith, why is it that you give that girl from the trailer park the benefit of every doubt, and you give me none?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLexi\u2014and you certainly know her name by now\u2014has been like a part of this family for the past three years. She has never disappointed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have.\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t answer. What was the point? Instead, she stood up. \u201cHow about we have lunch now?\u201d</p><p>Her mother rose. \u201cThat would be nice.\u201d</p><p>They spent the rest of the appointed time\u2014exactly two hours, from twelve to two, talking about things that didn\u2019t matter. When it was over, Mother kissed Jude perfunctorily on the cheek and went to the entry, where she paused. \u201cGood-bye, Judith. Today was lovely. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Mother.\u201d</p> <p>Jude stared through the open door at her mother\u2019s slim figure, walking fast through the garden, not bothering to look at any of it. As hard as she tried to feel nothing, Jude experienced the free-form depression that always accompanied these lunches. Why was it that she couldn\u2019t quite stop wanting her mother\u2019s love? The Mercedes came to life with a throaty purr and drove slowly up the driveway.</p><p>On the entry table, a cordless phone lay next to a glass bowl filled with floating roses. Jude picked it up and punched in her best friend\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly. Thank God,\u201d Jude said, leaning against the wall. Suddenly, she was exhausted. \u201cThe wicked witch was just here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother? Is it Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwenty minutes. Dockside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you there.\u201d</p><p>On Friday, after school, they went shopping for dresses. Jude was ridiculously pleased about the whole thing. She knew it was just a dance, nothing earth-shattering, but it was Mia\u2019s first real date, and Jude was eager to make the whole experience perfect for her daughter. To that end, she\u2019d set up manicures and pedicures for both of them\u2014and Lexi, of course\u2014and an evening of shopping at the mall.</p><p>She heard her bedroom door open and she turned. Miles stood in the doorway. He leaned against the doorjamb, wearing a pair of well-worn Levi\u2019s and an Aerosmith T-shirt. In the pale autumn light, he looked ruggedly handsome. A gray stubble had grown out during the day, giving his face a sculpted look. \u201cI come home from work early and you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she went to him, let him take her in his arms. \u201cWhy is it, Dr. Farraday, that you don\u2019t shave and your hair starts going gray and you manage to look more handsome, but if I forget makeup for one day, people mistake me for Grandma Moses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey only call you that behind your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>He touched her jawline, a featherlight caress. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Jude, and you know it. It\u2019s why things go your way.\u201d</p><p>It was true for both of them. Miles had been golden from childhood. Good-looking and brilliant, with a ready smile, he seduced people without even trying. His nickname at the hospital was Doc Hollywood.</p><p>\u201cTake Zach out for dinner. I\u2019ll be home as soon as I can. Maybe we can sit on the beach tonight and have a glass of wine. We haven\u2019t done that in a while.\u201d</p><p>Miles drew her in for a kiss that meant something. Then he swatted her butt. \u201cYou better go before I remember how much I like afternoon sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to morning sex and evening sex, which you hate?\u201d She twirled playfully out of his grasp and headed upstairs.</p><p>At Zach\u2019s bedroom door, she knocked, waited for a \u201ccome in,\u201d and opened the door. He sat in that expensive new game chair of his, playing something on his Xbox. She touched his head, scratched his hair. His hair was still damp from football practice. He lifted up into her touch, straining like a flower toward the sun.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the mall to buy Mia a dress for the dance. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to the dance, remember? Amanda will be in L.A. with her family.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat down on the bed. \u201cI hate that you\u2019re not going. It\u2019s senior year. And Mia tells me you\u2019re a shoo-in for homecoming king.\u201d</p><p>Zach rolled his eyes. \u201cBig deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should take a friend to the dance. Someday you\u2019ll look back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I care about that crap in the future, shoot me. Really.\u201d</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cOkay, fine. But at least come shopping with us. It would mean a lot to Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Lexi was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. What does that have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia has a friend with her. And I am not sitting outside a dressing room while my sister tries on dresses. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I\u2019m not giving up on the dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shock,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving up on something. And do not buy me jeans again. I mean it, Mom. You don\u2019t get what I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Fine.\u201d Jude scratched his head one last time and turned away from him.</p><p>She left Zach\u2019s room and met Mia in the hallway. Together, they went out to the garage. In fifteen minutes, they had picked up Lexi and were on their way to the mall.</p><p>At the first store, Mia wandered among the racks, looking a little confused and overwhelmed, and then suddenly she pulled out a dress. \u201cLook at this one,\u201d she said, holding up a floor-length salmon-pink dress with lacy sleeves and a tiered skirt. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked Lexi.</p><p>Lexi smiled, but it was a little distracted. \u201cIt\u2019s great. Try it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll try one on, too. Please? I can\u2019t do it alone. You know I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sighed. She went to the rounder, found an aquamarine-blue gown with a beaded, strapless bodice, and followed Mia into the dressing rooms.</p><p>When they came out, Jude was stunned by how beautiful they both looked. \u201cThose are perfect,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mia studied her own reflection as she spun around. \u201cThese are definitely our dresses for homecoming, don\u2019t you think, Lexster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to the dance,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a date.\u201d</p><p>Mia stopped twirling. \u201cThen I\u2019m not going either.\u201d</p><p>Lexi muttered something under her breath and walked back into the dressing room. When she came back out, she was dressed in her jeans and T-shirt. \u201cNo more dresses for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford one anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lexi,\u201d Mia pleaded. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend. If you don\u2019t go to the dance, I won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could go with Zach,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Mia shrieked. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Mom. We can totally double-date.\u201d</p><p>Lexi gasped. \u201cI am not going to force your brother to take me to a stupid dance.\u201d On that, she walked away from them.</p><p>Tears immediately brightened Mia\u2019s eyes. \u201cDid I hurt her feelings, Mom? I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>Jude watched Lexi leave the store. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe all just ... forget sometimes that Lexi doesn\u2019t have the same opportunities that you do. We should have been a little more sensitive. Come on.\u201d They walked over to the register, where Jude paid for both dresses. She had the clerk box up Lexi\u2019s. \u201cGo get dressed, Poppet. I\u2019ll take care of Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Jude walked out of the small boutique and into the busy mall, carrying a shopping bag. Everywhere she looked, she saw packs of girls, no doubt armed with their parents\u2019 credit cards. No wonder Lexi was out of sorts. It had to be difficult to be different from all the kids you knew, from your best friend, who just expected to get what she wanted.</p><p>Jude saw Lexi sitting on the bench outside the bookstore. She was slumped forward, with her long black hair falling across her downcast face.</p><p>Jude went to her, sat down. Lexi scooted sideways to make room for her.</p><p>\u201cSorry for the rant,\u201d Lexi mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI should have been more sensitive. I know those dresses are expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>Jude tucked the hair back behind Lexi\u2019s ear so she could see the girl\u2019s face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool. I shouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal out of it.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat back. Her heart ached for Lexi; she knew how hard life had been for the girl, how hard it still was sometimes. While most of the island kids\u2014like her own\u2014were looking all over the country for the perfect college, Lexi was planning on going to the local junior college after graduation. She worked too many hours at the ice cream shop, saving every cent she earned. Her pie-in-the-sky dream was a full scholarship to the UW, but those were few and far between. It pained Jude to think that Lexi would miss the rite-of-passage senior year homecoming dance. \u201cI hear Zach has a good chance of being homecoming king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kaye Hurtt is a shoo-in for queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be Maria de la Pena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Zach won\u2019t be there because Amanda\u2019s going to be out of town.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tilted her face to Jude. If Jude hadn\u2019t known better, she would have said Lexi looked scared. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want either one of you to miss the dance. Zach would never take a real date, not while he\u2019s with Amanda, but you\u2019re his sister\u2019s best friend. Amanda wouldn\u2019t mind. And then all three of you could have fun at the dance. You\u2019ll always remember it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Lexi said quietly. \u201cWhat about what happened with Haley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey. You would never do something like that to Mia. This is a whole different thing.\u201d Jude smiled. She knew how sensitive Lexi was to overstepping her welcome, but this would be good for everyone. \u201cHow about if we let Zach decide?\u201d</p><p>Lexi stared at her for a long time, saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a sympathy date, Lexi. It\u2019s a night out for friends. And I really think Zach should be there when he\u2019s named homecoming king, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Lexi sighed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Jude held out the shopping bag. \u201cI bought the dress for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept that,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>Jude saw Lexi\u2019s gratitude, but there was something else in the girl\u2019s blue eyes, a dark, smoky shame that broke Jude\u2019s heart. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the family, Lexi. You know that. Let me do this for you, okay? I know you want to go to the dance. Let Zach take you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked down at the tile floor. The hair behind her ear fell free again, shielded her profile from Jude. \u201cOkay, Jude,\u201d she finally said, softly. \u201cIf Zach wants to take me, I\u2019ll go with him. But...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shook her head; her hair shimmered at the movement. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if he says no.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cOkay. Open your eyes,\u201d Jude said, putting her hands on Lexi\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>Lexi drew in a deep breath and did as she was told. In front of her was a big mirror surrounded by tiny globe lights. For a split second, she saw a stranger\u2014a girl with sleek, glossy black hair, layered now around her face, and perfectly arched eyebrows. Carefully applied violet eyeliner had enhanced her blue eyes, given her a smoky, sophisticated look, and blush highlighted her high cheekbones. She was almost afraid to smile, in case it was an illusion.</p><p>Jude leaned closer. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi slipped out of the chair and turned around. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, hugging Jude tightly.</p><p>Later, on the ferry home, she and Mia sat in the backseat of the Escalade, with Jude in the driver\u2019s seat. Lexi kept sneaking looks at herself in the mirror. She wanted to believe it would make a difference somehow, this transformation, that Zach would finally look at her and think she was pretty. But she knew better.</p><p>Tonight was not going to go well. Honestly, she couldn\u2019t fathom why he\u2019d agreed to take her to the dance\u2014probably because Jude and Mia had pressured him mercilessly, and one thing was always true: Zach hated to disappoint his sister.</p><p>If only Lexi hadn\u2019t almost kissed him. None of this would be a problem if she\u2019d never turned to him that night. Or if she\u2019d told Mia the truth. If only ... if only. It was a list that went on and on, and she\u2019d reread it so many times in her mind that she felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>It had been a week since the party\u2014since the hilltop. Lexi had repeatedly intended to tell Mia the truth, but she hadn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t, and now, for the first time, when she saw her best friend, Lexi felt like a liar. And every time she saw Zach, she ran like a track star. She was terrified that she\u2019d ruined everything, that when her secret came out, she\u2019d lose Mia\u2019s friendship and Jude\u2019s respect. Everything that mattered to her.</p><p>\u201cI should have said no,\u201d Lexi muttered later, as she and Mia bounded up the stairs at the Farraday house to get dressed. \u201cThis has disaster written all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get you,\u201d Mia said, closing the door behind them. \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lexi immediately felt guilty. \u201cSorry. It\u2019ll be fun. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d She went to Mia\u2019s overflowing closet, where both dresses hung between sheets of plastic. They dressed and studied themselves in the oval mirror by the desk. Only occasionally could Mia\u2019s black-and-white Converse high-tops be seen under her hemline.</p> <p>\u201cI think I look okay,\u201d Mia said, turning to Lexi. Her green eyes held worry. \u201cDon\u2019t I? Will he think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous. Tyler will\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock at the door interrupted them. There was a pause, then it opened. Jude stood there, holding a silver camera. \u201cTyler is here.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked nervously at Lexi. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally hot. He\u2019s lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>Mia threw her arms around Lexi and hugged her tightly. \u201cThank God you\u2019re with me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have the guts to go downstairs without you.\u201d</p><p>Holding hands, they left the bedroom and walked down the big curving staircase.</p><p>Zach and Tyler were in the living room, standing together, talking. Both were wearing blue suits. Zach\u2019s hair was still wet\u2014the football game had just ended and he\u2019d raced home to get ready.</p><p>He looked up and saw Lexi. She saw the way he frowned as she came down the stairs. Her heart started beating so fast she felt light-headed.</p><p>Be cool, she thought.</p><p>She\u2019d say she was sorry right away, laugh it off, that stupid near-kiss. Maybe she\u2019d say she\u2019d been drunk and didn\u2019t remember any of it. Could she pull that off?</p><p>As she neared him, Zach stepped forward, offering her a blue-tipped white carnation in a clear plastic box. \u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got, like, a rubber band on it; it goes on your wrist,\u201d he said. \u201cAmanda says they\u2019re the best kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said again, not daring to look at him. He\u2019d mentioned his girlfriend; she got the point.</p><p>\u201cOkay, picture time,\u201d Jude said. Miles came up beside her. \u201cWe\u2019ll need fingerprints from you, Tyler,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Mia shrieked, blushing.</p><p>Lexi moved awkwardly into place beside Zach. He put an arm around her, but didn\u2019t pull her close. They stood like images from an Old West photograph, stiff and unsmiling.</p><p>Flash. Click.</p><p>The photographs went on and on, until finally Zach said, \u201cNo more, dos amigos. We\u2019re outta here.\u201d</p><p>As they started for the door, Lexi pulled away from Zach. She stepped into the entryway, where she\u2019d left a brown shopping bag by the table. Reaching inside, she pulled up a small green plastic container that held a potted purple petunia.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you,\u201d Lexi said to Jude, feeling her face grow hot. It was such a little gift\u2014she\u2019d found it on the half-price counter at the local nursery. It was probably totally the wrong thing, but it was all Lexi could afford. \u201cI know you don\u2019t really need anything, but I looked ... and you don\u2019t have any petunias, so I thought ... anyway, thanks for the dress.\u201d</p><p>Jude smiled. \u201cThank you, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lexster,\u201d Mia said from the doorway.</p><p>Lexi walked to the door with Jude, and then followed Mia out to the Mustang.</p><p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock curfew,\u201d Jude yelled from the doorway.</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t seem to be listening. He walked on ahead to the Mustang, which was parked out front. He opened Lexi\u2019s door but didn\u2019t wait for her to get in. Instead, he walked around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>When Mia and Tyler were settled in the backseat, Lexi took her place beside Zach. He started up the car and cranked on the music.</p><p>All the way to the high school, Mia and Tyler whispered together. Zach kept his eyes on the road. He seemed pissed off at Lexi, or at the fact that she was his date. She could hardly blame him. In the school lot, he parked close to the stairs, and the four of them merged into the colorful river of kids streaming into the gymnasium, which had been transformed into a tacky version of New Orleans, complete with streamers and fake moss. The Mardi Gras theme continued when they walked into the gym, where a chaperone handed them a handful of brightly colored bead necklaces.</p><p>The song playing was \u201cHella Good,\u201d and the dance floor was overflowing.</p><p>They got their pictures taken first\u2014each couple alone, then the girls, then Mia and Zach.</p><p>Lexi could see how stiff Zach was. Every girl in the senior class seemed to be watching them. No doubt Amanda had asked for a full report, and Zach wasn\u2019t going to do anything to hurt his girlfriend\u2019s feelings. He wouldn\u2019t even look at Lexi.</p><p>Finally, he took her hand and led her out onto the dance floor. As they got there, the music changed, slowed down. He took her in his arms.</p><p>Lexi stared at his chest, tried to move with him and not step on his feet. Honestly, she had no idea how to dance, and she was so nervous, she couldn\u2019t breathe. Finally, she looked up and found him staring down at her, his eyes unreadable. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t want to take me to the dance, Zach. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d was all she could think of to say.</p><p>He grabbed her by the hand and pulled her through the crowd. She stumbled along behind him, trying to keep up, smiling at the people she pushed past so it didn\u2019t seem weird that Zach was pulling her off the dance floor.</p><p>He kept going, past the punch bowl and the row of parent/teacher chaperones and through the big doors to the football field. There, everything was black and still. The stars overhead joined with a bright moon and set the goalposts aglow.</p><p>Zach finally stopped. \u201cWhy did you try to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I lost my balance. It was stupid...\u201d She sighed and looked up, immediately wishing she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wanted you to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, Zach,\u201d she said. Her voice cracked, betraying her. She knew his reputation. He probably said things like this all the time. He went through girlfriends like she went through lip gloss. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I kiss you, Lex?\u201d</p><p>In her mind, she said no, but when Zach looked down at her, she shook her head, unable to find her voice.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to stop me,\u201d he said, pulling her close, \u201cthis would be the time.\u201d</p><p>And then he was kissing her and she was falling and flying, twisting into someone else, something else. When he finally drew back, he looked as pale and shaky as she felt, and she was glad of that, because she was crying.</p><p>Crying. What an idiot ...</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach!\u201d</p><p>Lexi heard Mia\u2019s voice and she lurched away from Zach, wiping the stupid tears from her eyes.</p><p>Mia ran up to them. \u201cThey\u2019re crowning the homecoming king and queen. You better get in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about that. I\u2019m talking to Lexi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Zach looked at Lexi again, frowning; then he walked off, headed for the gymnasium.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you two doing out here?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>Lexi started walking toward the gym. She didn\u2019t dare look at her best friend. \u201cHe wanted to tell me something about the game tonight.\u201d She forced a laugh. \u201cYou know me. I don\u2019t know jack about football.\u201d She winced. Another lie to her best friend. Who was she becoming? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the last time that night she and Zach were alone together until he walked her up to the front door of the mobile home, and even then, Mia was in the car, watching them.</p><p>At her door, Lexi had no idea what to say to him. Everything felt off balance; she was like some prey animal, frozen with fear, her senses acute. The kiss had rocked her world, but had it even made a ripple in his?</p><p>He stared down at her, his golden hair turned silver by the moonlight.</p><p>She wanted to scream say something but managed only a shaky smile. \u201cThanks for letting me be your sympathy date, Zach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCurfew,\u201d Mia yelled from the car. \u201cMom will have a cow if we\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Zach leaned down, kissed Lexi\u2019s cheek. It took all her effort not to respond, not to put her arms around him, but she just stood there, feeling his lips on her skin like a branding iron.</p><p>She stood there a long time, long after they\u2019d left. Then, finally, she went into her house and turned off the lights.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t go to school on Monday. How could she face either Zach or Mia after what had happened?</p> <p>By Monday night, though (and he hadn\u2019t called, of course he hadn\u2019t, why would she think he would?), Eva had threatened to make a doctor\u2019s appointment\u2014something they definitely couldn\u2019t afford.</p><p>So, on Tuesday, Lexi went back to school. Out at the bus stop, she huddled under the narrow shelter\u2019s overhang, watching rain turn the world into a blue and green kaleidoscope.</p><p>She would just be cool.</p><p>She\u2019d smile casually at Zach and keep walking, as if the kiss meant nothing. She wasn\u2019t a complete idiot. It had just been a kiss from a boy who kissed girls all the time. Lexi couldn\u2019t let it mean anything to her.</p><p>At school, she easily avoided Zach\u2014they hardly moved in the same social circles\u2014but there was no way to avoid Mia. Their lives were too braided together. After the last bell, Mia walked Lexi to work.</p><p>All the way downtown, Lexi kept a smile on her face as she listened to Mia\u2019s dance play-by-play. Again. But the word liar screamed through her mind over and over, and every time she looked at her best friend, she felt sick to her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cWe made out. Did I tell you that?\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cOnly about a million times.\u201d Lexi stopped in front of Amor\u00e9, where a sweet, vanilla-scented air enveloped them. She meant to just say later and go inside, but instead she paused. \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first I thought his tongue was kinda slippery and gross, but I got used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCry?\u201d Mia looked confused, then nervous. \u201cShould I have cried?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cWhat do I know about kissing?\u201d</p><p>Mia frowned at Lexi. \u201cYou\u2019re acting weird. Did something happen at the dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what could have happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something with Zach, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Lexi hated herself; she wanted to tell the truth, but the thought of losing Mia\u2019s friendship terrified her. And what would be the point, really? It had just been a single kiss, not the start of anything. \u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m fine. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mia said, believing her. And that just made Lexi feel worse. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Lexi walked into the ice cream shop. It was brightly lit, with a long glass and chrome ice cream counter and a small area that contained a few tables and chairs. In the warmer months, this place was hopping busy, but now, in mid-October, business was pretty slow.</p><p>Her boss, Mrs. Solter, was standing at the register when Lexi walked in. A bell tinkled over the door at her entrance.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lexi,\u201d Mrs. Solter said brightly. \u201cHow was your dance?\u201d</p><p>Lexi forced a smile. \u201cGreat. Here. I brought you some necklaces.\u201d She held out the Mardi Gras beads from the dance. Mrs. Solter lit up at the sight of them and swooped in like a magpie for the shiny necklaces.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Lexi. That was thoughtful of you.\u201d Mrs. Solter immediately put all the necklaces around her neck.</p><p>Lexi spent the rest of the day and into the evening waiting on customers. At nine o\u2019clock, when business had slowed down to almost nothing, she set about cleaning the counters and getting ready to close up. She was coming out of the back room, carrying a container of Windex and a soggy rag, when Zach walked into the shop.</p><p>The bell tinkled gaily above him; she could barely hear it over the sudden acceleration of her heartbeat.</p><p>He never came here alone. Amanda was always with him, hanging on to him like that Louisiana moss you saw in horror flicks. Lexi slipped behind the counter so there was something between them.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, moving toward her.</p><p>\u201cHi. You ... want ice cream?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her intently. \u201cMeet me at LaRiviere Park tonight.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the bell tinkled again and the door flew open. Amanda rushed into the shop and sidled up to Zach, putting her tentacle-arm around him. \u201cHey, Lexi. Thanks for keeping an eye on Zach for me. At the dance, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t smile, even though she wanted to. \u201cYou want ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. It\u2019s too fattening,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cCome on, Zach. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She moved toward the door.</p><p>Zach stayed where he was. Ten o\u2019clock, he mouthed. Please.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s heart was pounding as she watched him follow his girlfriend out of the shop.</p><p>Ten.</p><p>She would be an idiot to think he really meant for her to meet him at the beach. He was dating Amanda, the human Post-it note. They were the most popular couple in school.</p><p>And it would hurt Mia if she found out. A kiss at the dance was one thing, almost understandable even, ordinary. This\u2014sneaking out to be with him\u2014would be something else. A bigger lie.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t do it. Shouldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>She glanced over at her boss. Don\u2019t do it, Lexi. \u201cUh, Mrs. Solter? I was wondering if I could leave a few minutes early. Maybe nine-fifty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can handle closing up by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cHot date?\u201d</p><p>Lexi hoped her laughter didn\u2019t sound as nervous as it felt. \u201cWhen have you ever known me to have a hot date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose boys at your school must be blind, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>For the remainder of her shift, Lexi refused to think about the decision she\u2019d made. She focused on her job and did it to the best of her ability. It wasn\u2019t until later, when she left the shop, that nerves got the best of her.</p><p>She was an idiot to do this, but she kept walking.</p><p>Main Street was quiet on this chilly autumn night. Lights glowed through restaurant windows, but there were few patrons at this hour.</p><p>She passed the brightly lit Island Center grocery store and kept going, past the ferry terminal, past the Windermere Real Estate office and the Lil Ones Nursery School. In less than five minutes, she was out of town. Here, black stained the sky; a bright blue moon glowed above the towering treetops. There weren\u2019t many houses out this way, and the few that were here were mostly summer homes for Seattleites, and their windows were dark.</p><p>At the entrance to LaRiviere Beach Park, she paused.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be here.</p><p>Still, she followed the winding asphalt road down to the sandy stretch of beach. Moonlight shone on the tangle of giant driftwood piled up on the coarse gray sand.</p><p>There were no cars in the parking area.</p><p>Of course there weren\u2019t.</p><p>She walked out to the beach. The pile of giant driftwood\u2014whole trees washed up onto the shore and tangled together\u2014lay like giant toothpicks on the sand. A brightly lit ferry chugged through the Sound, looking like a Chinese lantern against the black water. Behind it, the Seattle skyline was a tiara of colored lights.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She heard Zach\u2019s voice and turned. \u201cI didn\u2019t see your car,\u201d was all she could think to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at the end of the other lot.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the hand and led her to a place where he had a blanket spread out on the sand.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve brought a few girls here,\u201d she said nervously. She needed to remember that. What was special for her was ordinary for him.</p><p>He sat down and pulled her gently down beside him. She immediately took her hand back. She couldn\u2019t be smart when he was touching her, and she needed to be smart. This was her best friend\u2019s brother.</p><p>He said, \u201cLook at me, Lexi. Please,\u201d and she was helpless to resist. He tucked a curly strand of hair behind her ear. It was the gentlest touch she\u2019d ever felt, and it made her want to cry. \u201cI know we shouldn\u2019t be together. Do you want to be, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said quietly. She closed her eyes, unable to look at him. In the darkness, she heard his breath, felt it against her lips, and all she could think about was how often she\u2019d been hurt. Lexi thought about her druggo mom, who\u2019d told her all the time how much she loved her. She\u2019d hold Lexi so tightly Lexi couldn\u2019t breathe, and then suddenly it would be over. Her mom would get pissed and storm off and forget she even had a daughter. The only time Lexi remembered ever being happy before Pine Island was when her mother went to prison. Lexi had been with a nice family then, the Rexlers, and they\u2019d tried to make her feel as if she belonged. Then her mother had come back.</p><p>Usually Lexi tried not to remember those last days with her mother, when Momma had been high all the time and pissed off and mean. Lexi had learned the truth about love then, how close it could be to hate, and how it could empty you out.</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s friendship means everything to me,\u201d she said, finally looking at him. She saw how her words hurt him, and she understood at last. All that hostility of his, all that looking away; it had been an act. \u201cYou pretended not to like me because of Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the start,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cI wanted to ask you out, but you were already her friend. So I stayed away ... or I tried to. I never could, though, not really. And then, when you tried to kiss me...\u201d</p><p>Lexi\u2019s heart felt like taking flight. How was it possible that she could be so happy and so sad at the same time? \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t talk about this anymore. We should just forget about it. I couldn\u2019t lose Mia or your family. I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve already been hurt enough, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t already thought all of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop it anymore, Lex. I\u2019ve been thinking about you for three years. Maybe if you hadn\u2019t kissed me back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to,\u201d she said quietly. It was impossible to lie to him. How could she? She had loved him from the second she first saw him. She started to smile and thought about her teeth and bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI love your smile,\u201d he said, leaning toward her. She felt the distance between them closing, smelled the peppermint of his breath.</p><p>The kiss started slowly, gently. She felt his tongue touch hers, and her heart seemed to take flight. When he took her in his arms, she gave up, gave in. The kiss went on and on, deepening until she thought she couldn\u2019t stand for it to end. Behind them, the waves whooshed along the shore, and it became a song. Their song. Their sound. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Desire came from somewhere deep inside of her, radiating outward, tingling, aching. She started to tremble so hard he drew back, looked at her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No, she wanted to say, no I\u2019m not, but when she saw herself reflected in his eyes, she was ruined. She wanted him with a ferocity that terrified her. It was dangerous to want anything in this life, but his love maybe most of all. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied. \u201cJust cold.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cCan we come here again tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>They were going down a bad road here; she should hit the brakes now, tell him it was too bad that they loved each other and let it go. Now, while she still could. She should tell him no, say she wouldn\u2019t do anything to jeopardize her friendship with Mia, but when she looked at him, she had no strength to turn him away. He made everything inside of her stop hurting.</p> <p>Dangerous, Lexi, she thought, say no. Think of your best friend and what matters. But when he kissed her again, she whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Jude sat in bed with her husband, listening with half an ear to the late-night news. An expensive down comforter, covered by a custom silk duvet, floated like a cloud around them. In the past few days\u2014since the dance, in fact\u2014her mommy radar had been emitting a strong signal. Something was wrong with Zach, and she didn\u2019t know what it was. Nothing bothered her more than being out of the loop in her kids\u2019 lives. \u201cZach broke up with Amanda,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>She looked at him. How was it that no matter what drama unfolded in this house, he never seemed to worry? He accused her of being a helicopter parent, all noise and movement, hovering too close to her children, but if that were true, he was a satellite, positioned so far up in the sky he needed a high-powered telescope to track the goings-on in his own home. Maybe it was the medical school training. He\u2019d learned how to suppress his emotions a little too well. \u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could have said less, actually. It\u2019s hardly an event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMolly said Bryson said Zach was acting weird after football practice. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s handling the breakup as well as it appears. You should talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man. He\u2019s a teenage boy. Talking is hardly our best sport.\u201d Miles smiled at her. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dying to ask him what\u2019s going on. You can\u2019t help yourself. So, go. Just listen to the kid and believe him when he says Amanda doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s seventeen. When I was seventeen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour horndog past is not comforting.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek and climbed over him to get out of bed. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me, I know.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Jude left their bedroom.</p><p>The second floor was ablaze with light. As usual, neither of her intelligent children had mastered the incredibly complex hand-and-eye coordination necessary to turn off a light switch. She paused outside Mia\u2019s door, listening. She could tell that her daughter was on the phone. No doubt she was talking to either Lexi or Tyler.</p><p>Jude made her way to Zach\u2019s room. At his closed door, she paused. She would not batter him with questions or bury him under advice. This time she would just listen.</p><p>She knocked and got no answer. Knocking again, she announced herself and opened the door.</p><p>He was in his game chair, wielding the black remote as if he were a fighter pilot, which, on-screen, he was.</p><p>\u201cHey you,\u201d she said, coming up beside him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to beat this level.\u201d</p> <p>She sat down on the black shag rug beside him. This room had been decorated once by a professional and redone over the years by Zach. Expensive chocolate-colored wallpaper had been covered by movie posters. The bookshelves were an archaeological display of his childhood: a graveyard of action figures, a tangled heap of plastic dinosaurs, stacks of video game cases, a dog-eared copy of Captain Underpants, and the five Harry Potter novels.</p><p>She wanted to say, Can we talk? but to a teenage boy (or most any male), one might as well say, May I please rip out your spleen?</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d Zach said. \u201cYou think I\u2019m doing drugs? Or spraying graffiti? Maybe you\u2019re worried that I\u2019m a girl trapped in a dude\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. \u201cI am so misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do worry about the weirdest shit. I mean stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about Amanda? Or how you feel? I\u2019ve been through a few broken hearts in my time. Keith Corcoran in high school almost ruined me.\u201d</p><p>He put down the controller and looked at her. \u201cHow did you know you loved Dad?\u201d</p><p>Jude was pleasantly surprised by the question. Usually she had to pry this kind of conversation out of her son. But maybe he was growing up, or maybe he\u2019d actually been hurt by Amanda.</p><p>There were so many things she could say, memories she could share, and if she were talking to Mia, she might have done just that. But this was Zach. She didn\u2019t want to ruin this moment by talking too much.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw him, I knew. I know it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s true. When he said he loved me, I believed him, and I hadn\u2019t believed anyone since my dad. Until Miles ... and you kids, I used to worry that I was like my mother. Your dad reminded me what love felt like, I guess, and when he kissed me for the first time, I cried. I didn\u2019t know why then, but now I do. It was love and it scared the bejesus out of me. I knew I\u2019d never be the same again.\u201d She smiled at her son, who for once was soaking up every word. \u201cSomeday you\u2019ll meet the right girl, Zach. I promise. Only you\u2019ll be grown up and she\u2019ll be a woman, and when you kiss her, you\u2019ll know you belong with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky she will.\u201d</p><p>In the next two weeks, Lexi learned about keeping secrets. When she was with Zach, her love for him was overpowering, a wave that knocked her sideways so hard she couldn\u2019t tell which way was up. Later, when she was with Mia, guilt smacked her just as hard. Mia knew something was up with Zach, but it never occurred to her to look to Lexi for answers.</p><p>That was the worst of it, the broken trust. More than once Lexi had almost blurted out the truth, desperate for absolution, but she hadn\u2019t done it, hadn\u2019t opened her heart to her best friend. And why not?</p><p>Love. She couldn\u2019t deny Zach anything, it seemed, and he wasn\u2019t ready to tell his sister about them. Lexi wasn\u2019t even completely sure why; she just knew that Zach was afraid to tell Mia, and if Zach was afraid, Lexi was more so.</p><p>Every night, he picked Lexi up from work and drove them out to \u201ctheir\u201d beach. There, they lay on a blue plaid woolen blanket, talking. Lexi told him about her early years, what it had been like with her mother, how it felt to be forgotten and abandoned; Zach listened and held her hand and told her she was the strongest person he knew. He told her about his dreams for medical school and the expectations of success that sometimes crushed his spirit.</p><p>The stars overhead became their private universe. Zach pointed out the constellations and told her the stories that went along with each one: tales of gods and monsters, love and tragedy. His voice in the cold darkness became the home port she\u2019d never known; in his arms, she discovered peace. She saw a side of him she\u2019d never imagined. He felt things so deeply that sometimes he was afraid of his own emotions, and he worried that he would disappoint his parents. His surprising insecurities only made her love him more.</p><p>Tonight, they lay together, looking up at the giant universe. He took her in his arms and rolled over, covering her body with his own. She kissed him deeply, pouring every piece of her heart into the kiss, as if she could somehow meld their souls with the sheer force of her love. When his hand slid inside her shirt, up her bare back, she let him go. It felt so good to be touched like that by him.</p><p>He unhooked her bra. She felt the soft cups slip away from her breasts, and then he was touching her there.</p><p>She dragged herself sideways, slipped out from underneath him. Breathing hard, aching for his touch, she lay there.</p><p>\u201cLex? Did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She refastened her bra and then rolled over to face him. In the moonlight, he was so handsome she could hardly breathe for wanting him. But she\u2019d seen her mother give her body away too many times to be reckless with her own. She sat up, back on her heels, and bowed her head. Was this what love did to a person, twisted them up and emptied them out until there was nothing left but need? If so, how would she survive it? \u201cWhat are you doing with me, Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Lexi steeled herself. If she\u2019d learned anything from her mother, it was that nothing good grows in the dark. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be your secret, Zach. If you\u2019re ashamed of me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshamed? Is that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to tell Mia about us ... or your family.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAh, Lex ... I love you. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, and something in the sound reminded her how damaged she was, how certain she was that no one could love her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like being a twin. I love Mia, but I want you to be mine. And my mom jumps into my life like it\u2019s a swimming pool. She\u2019ll have an opinion on this, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Zach. So much I can\u2019t believe it. But I can\u2019t be just yours. Mia\u2019s my best friend. We have to tell her. And your parents are important to me, too. I need them to like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I don\u2019t want to hurt Mia. If she thinks I stole you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can belong to both of you,\u201d Lexi said solemnly. \u201cI already do.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her one more time and took her by the hand, pulling her to her feet. In a silence that suddenly felt ominous, they gathered up the blanket and stood beneath the stars, facing each other. The burden of their decision felt unbearably heavy, and Lexi almost wanted to take it back, to say, let\u2019s keep it secret a little longer. What if she lost him because of it? She didn\u2019t fool herself. It was possible. If Zach had to choose between Lexi and his family, it would be no contest. He would always choose Mia, who was as much a part of him as the green of his eyes. The bond that connected the twins ran deep. Last year, Zach had been hurt on the football field, and Mia had known instantly; she\u2019d felt her brother\u2019s pain.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. She\u2019ll understand. She has to.\u201d</p><p>The next day, as Lexi sat in one class after another, supposedly listening to her teachers drone on about this or that, all she could think about was telling Mia the truth. She imagined the conversation over and over, polishing each remorseful word like an agate. And still, when the last bell rang, she had the urge to just run away.</p><p>What if Mia didn\u2019t forgive her? Lexi could lose everything that mattered.</p><p>If only she\u2019d done the right thing the first time and told the truth. She, of all people, should have known better. She\u2019d grown up on a diet of lies; she knew the bitter taste they left in your mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After class, she joined the throng of kids in the hallway. On either side of her, lockers clanged open and shut; students were laughing, talking, shoving one another. Mia met her outside of her last-period class, and together they walked toward the flagpole.</p><p>Zach came up alongside Lexi and slung an arm around her as if it meant nothing, but at his touch, her whole body came alive. She was attuned to his smallest movement; the breath he took, the hair that fell across his eyes, the finger that stroked her upper arm.</p><p>She pulled away. It was meant to be a casual move, but she overdid it and stumbled into Mia.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Mia said, laughing. \u201cYou new to walking?\u201d</p> <p>Lexi looked at her best friend. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d She didn\u2019t dare look at Zach, but she felt his gaze on her, hot as a touch. \u201cPrivately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Mia shrugged. No hint of worry crossed her face. Why would it? She trusted these two more than anyone else in the world. Mia led the way to a grassy spot by the admin building, not far from the tree where she and Lexi had met on the first day of school. \u201cOkay,\u201d Mia said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t speak. She felt exposed suddenly, a liar. She would lose her best friend now. And maybe the boy she loved.</p><p>Zach reached out, took hold of Lexi\u2019s hand. \u201cWe wanted to tell you we\u2019re together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh. Duh. I can see that.\u201d Mia looked back at the row of buses. \u201cDo you see Ty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re together,\u201d Zach said again.</p><p>Mia slowly turned, looked at them, frowning now. \u201cTogether? As in hooked up? You two?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded.</p><p>The color drained from Mia\u2019s face. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe almost kissed me after the party at the Eisners\u2019 cabin,\u201d Zach said.</p> <p>\u201cThat was weeks ago,\u201d Mia said. \u201cLexi would have told me. Right, Lexster? You tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything but this,\u201d Lexi admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would ever happen. I met Zach on the first day of high school\u2014before I met you, even\u2014and I thought ... no, that isn\u2019t what I want to say. I always liked him, that\u2019s the point, but I never thought he\u2019d like me back. I mean ... he\u2019s Zach and I\u2019m ... me. And I didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to think ... I was one of those girls who\u2019d use you to get to him. Like Haley. It isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d Mia said, her mouth trembling. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her, Me-my,\u201d Zach said. \u201cAnd we love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-love? So all this time, you\u2019ve been sneaking around behind my back? I kept asking Zach what was wrong, and he said nothing. Neither of you said anything. Were you laughing at me the whole time?\u201d Mia said, stricken.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zach said. \u201cCome on, you know us better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? You\u2019re both liars.\u201d Mia\u2019s eyes filled with tears. She spun on her heels and ran for the row of school buses, climbing aboard just as the doors closed.</p><p>Lexi saw Mia on the bus, staring at them through the cloudy window, her pale face streaked with tears, her hand pressed to the glass.</p> <p>Zach put his arm around her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lex. She\u2019ll be okay with this. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t?\u201d Lexi whispered. \u201cWhat if she never forgives me?\u201d</p><p>For the next several hours, Lexi sat in her lonely bedroom, staring into a future without Mia\u2019s friendship.</p><p>Yeah, she loved Zach. With all of her heart and soul, but she didn\u2019t love Mia any less. It was a different emotion, rounder and softer and more comfortable; maybe it was more solid and reliable, too. All she knew was that she couldn\u2019t trade one for the other. That would be like having to choose between air to breathe and water to drink. She needed both to survive.</p><p>She never should have kept this secret from her friend. She should have done the right thing from the beginning\u2014if she had, none of this would be happening now. It was a truth she should have learned from her childhood. Always do the right thing from the start. Instead, she\u2019d done the wrong thing and hurt her best friend\u2019s feelings.</p><p>She knew what she had to do. She left her small, tidy bedroom and walked down the narrow hallway to the living room, where she found Eva sitting on the couch, watching TV.</p><p>\u201cCan I go to Mia\u2019s house?\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cAt this hour? On a school night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d Lexi said. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do if her aunt said no.</p><p>Eva looked at her. \u201cThis about that boy of yours?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou going to do the right thing?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded again, realizing with a jolt of shame that Eva had known what was going on all along. \u201cI have to tell Mia the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is always a good thing.\u201d Eva set down the remote. The pleats in her careworn face were emphasized by a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Lexi hated how that made her feel. She hadn\u2019t been a good girl lately. She swallowed hard, smiled one time, briefly, almost desperately, and then she left the house.</p><p>In almost no time, the county bus had dropped her off on Night Road. She walked the last few hundred yards to the Farraday house, which was blazing with lights on this dark autumn night. She picked her way through the carefully landscaped front yard and went up to the front door. She hesitated for a moment and then rang the bell.</p><p>Long minutes passed and finally Zach answered. \u201cLex,\u201d he said, looking broken. \u201cShe won\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your parents here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded and moved past him, going up the stairs. At Mia\u2019s room, she didn\u2019t even knock, just pushed the door open and went inside. Mia stood by the big oval mirror. Even in the shadowy light, Lexi could see how wounded Mia had been by them. \u201cMia,\u201d Lexi said, moving forward. She felt Zach come up behind her.</p><p>\u201cI trusted you,\u201d Mia said, her mouth trembling.</p><p>Lexi would have preferred anger, screaming; anything would have been better than Mia\u2019s quiet heartbreak. \u201cMia, you\u2019re the best friend I\u2019ve ever had. I love you like a sister, and I\u2019m sorry if I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. You both did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I want you to know how much you matter to me. No one has ever mattered as much. You have to believe that. If you want me to break up with him, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Zach said, stepping toward her.</p><p>Lexi ignored him. Her gaze stayed steady on Mia. \u201cI\u2019ll break up with him, I will. But I can\u2019t stop loving him. I don\u2019t know how. I should have told you that a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Mia wiped her eyes. \u201cThere was always something weird about the way you looked at each other. I thought I was being oversensitive ... because of Haley.\u201d She sighed heavily. \u201cI know how I feel about Tyler. If it\u2019s like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Lexi said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYou promise you won\u2019t dump me for him?\u201d Mia said.</p><p>It was an easy promise to make. Lexi let go of Zach\u2019s hand and moved toward Mia. \u201cI promise. And I\u2019ll never lie to you again. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he breaks your heart,\u201d Mia said steadily, \u201cyou\u2019ll still be my best friend? Because you\u2019ll need me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always need you,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI\u2019d die if I couldn\u2019t come over here. Honestly. No matter what happens with Zach and me, you and I will always be bffs.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cSay you\u2019re okay with this, Mia. Please.\u201d</p><p>Mia sniffed. Lexi wanted her friend to smile, but maybe that was asking too much. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cAnd it sounds crazy, but you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d Zach added.</p><p>\u201cI want you guys to be happy,\u201d Mia finally said. \u201cWhat kind of person would I be if I didn\u2019t? I love both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we love you,\u201d Lexi said. It was true; she loved Mia through and through. Her best friend was a lioness, as all of this proved. Mia had been hurt\u2014two people she trusted had lied to her\u2014and still she stood here, trying to smile, caring about their happiness.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be the three of us for senior year,\u201d Zach said, obviously relieved. \u201cHow cool will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw a party just yet,\u201d Mia said, looking at her brother. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to tell Mom tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t care, will she?\u201d Lexi asked, frowning. \u201cI mean, she likes me.\u201d</p><p>Mia finally smiled. \u201cAre you kidding? Our mom cares about everything.\u201d</p><p>The next night, the Journey Through Senior Year meeting was held at 6:00 P.M. in the high school library. Most of the island parents showed up.</p><p>\u201cWe all know how special Pine Island is,\u201d said police officer Roy Avery from his place at the head table. \u201cI know a lot of this year\u2019s seniors\u2014my own youngest son graduated two years ago\u2014and I\u2019ve watched this class go from Little League to varsity. I\u2019ve watched you protect them with car seats and helmets and airbags. Some of you might think that the biggest danger facing them now is that colleges will reject them, but there\u2019s a new threat; one some of you know all too well, and some of you know not at all.</p><p>\u201cPartying. Some of you think that the island keeps your kids safe, away from big-city dangers. But danger is here, too. It\u2019s in every empty house and lonely stretch of beach. It\u2019s in bottles of beer and rum. Starting about now every year, the senior class starts to feel both edgy and bulletproof. So keep an eye on your kids. Don\u2019t let them outsmart you. Let them know how dangerous partying can be.\u201d</p><p>As the crowd began to ask questions, Jude looked out at the familiar faces.</p><p>She\u2019d driven carpool with many of these women; together, over the years, they\u2019d sat freezing at football games, decorated gymnasiums for dances, been classroom moms. They\u2019d joined forces to raise their children in a safe community. Now there was a new enemy: drinking. She had no doubt that the mom patrol would join forces again and be on the lookout for potential trouble.</p><p>When Officer Avery returned to his seat, Jude stood up. \u201cThank you to Officer Avery for that important heads-up. And thank you to Ann Morford for her insight on the college application process. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be knocking on your door with more question as the deadlines approach. Now, as the head of the parent group, I get to talk about the fun part. Graduation night. As most of you know, Pine Island works to keep drinking and driving out of the graduation equation. To that end, we plan a fun-filled night for the senior class. They leave right after the ceremonies and board a bus. They\u2019ll get home at six A.M. the next morning. This year\u2019s festivities look great...\u201d</p><p>For the next few minutes, Jude laid out the plan she and her committee had come up with. Because it was Pine Island, and everyone had an opinion, she spent another ten minutes answering questions and then sent around a sign-up sheet for chaperone volunteers. After that, she joined her best friend, Molly, and they walked out of the gymnasium in a stream of parents. As always, Molly was dressed in an effortlessly chic style\u2014low-rise jeans, a fitted men\u2019s-style white shirt, and a necklace of hammered copper and turquoise. Her hair, cut short and dyed platinum this year, offset her dark eyes and ready smile. She and Jude had become friends more than a decade ago. Molly\u2019s son, Bryson, was the same age as the twins, so Molly and Jude had found themselves together at one function after another\u2014class functions, field trips, Chuck E. Cheese birthday parties. They\u2019d been friends ever since; Jude didn\u2019t think she would have made it through the tough middle school years without Molly and their Thursday margarita nights. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Together, they walked into the cold evening. Jude was just about to say something to Molly, when she heard:</p><p>\u201cThe party sounds great.\u201d</p><p>Jude turned to find Julie Williams beside her. \u201cHey, Julie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope Zach is feeling better,\u201d Julie said, buttoning up her coat.</p> <p>Jude felt through the mess in her purse, looking for her car keys. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsh says he sprained his ankle. He\u2019s missed practice most of the week.\u201d</p><p>Jude stopped and turned. \u201cZach missed football practice? Because of his ankle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d Molly said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAll week,\u201d Julie said.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s better now,\u201d Jude said evenly. \u201cIn fact I\u2019m sure of it. Tell Coach he\u2019ll be at practice tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsh will be glad to hear that,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAnd I signed up to chaperone the grad party. Let me know if you need me for anything else.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded distractedly. Actually, she wasn\u2019t even listening. Clutching her keys, she moved purposefully through the crowd, barely making eye contact with people around her. At the car, Molly stopped beside her. \u201cI take it he doesn\u2019t have a sprained ankle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lying little shit,\u201d Jude said. \u201cHe\u2019s come home from practice every day this week, right on time. He even had wet hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what has he been doing?\u201d Molly asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d like to know.\u201d She forced a smile. \u201cLunch tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll want to hear the scoop.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded and got into her car. All the way home, she talked to herself, practicing the conversation she would have with Zach.</p><p>Once inside the house, she called Zach on his cell phone, got no answer, and left a message. Then she began to pace. She should have made the kids come home for dinner tonight.</p><p>This time of night, the view outside was all but gone. A dark sky had settled over a black body of water. Only a few bright lights shone out here and there from the opposite shore. In the orange glow of her porch light, Jude saw a Halloween version of herself trapped in the glass.</p><p>She was there, tapping her foot, staring at her own reflection, when the twins came through the front door like bank robbers, shoving each other out of the way, their voices climbing over each other to be heard.</p><p>\u201cZachary, I need to speak to you,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>They skidded to a stop and looked up in perfect unison.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zach said, highlighting his mastery of the English language.</p> <p>Jude pointed to the sectional in the great room. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Zach moved slowly, his body pouring like syrup onto the overstuffed sofa. \u201cWhat?\u201d Already his gaze was narrowing, his arms were crossing. A shaft of blond hair obscured one green eye.</p><p>Mia plopped down beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou may go, Mia,\u201d Jude said to her daughter, her voice brooking no disobedience.</p><p>\u201cMom, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Jude said again.</p><p>With a dramatic sigh, Mia got up and flounced out of the room. Jude doubted she went far; her daughter was probably eavesdropping from the foyer.</p><p>Jude sat down in a chair opposite Zach. \u201cWhat do you have to tell me, Zachary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he said, not making eye contact. \u201cWe went to Pizza Factory for dinner. You had that meeting tonight. You told us to eat out. It\u2019s not even late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about your dinner plans tonight. You have something to tell me, and we both know it,\u201d Jude said sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou mean football,\u201d Zach said, sounding both miserable and guarded. \u201cCoach called you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn an island this size? You think that\u2019s how I find out things? Really, Zach? And what would Coach Williams have told me if he had called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I haven\u2019t been to practice in five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured, I hear. Funny that I haven\u2019t noticed a limp.\u201d</p><p>His rounded shoulders answered her question.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I didn\u2019t say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, Zach. It won\u2019t help you. Why have you missed practice?\u201d</p><p>Mia came back in the room and sat down next to her brother. She held his hand. \u201cTell her,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe were going to tell you when you got home tonight, Mom. Honest.\u201d</p><p>Jude crossed her arms and leaned back, waiting. There was no point in dismissing Mia. Jude shouldn\u2019t have bothered with that. \u201cYes, please, Zach. Enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been with Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with her,\u201d he said.</p><p>Love. Lexi.</p><p>Of all the excuses she\u2019d imagined, that hadn\u2019t even made the list. Zach was in love with his sister\u2019s best friend.</p><p>Jude looked at Mia, who wasn\u2019t smiling but didn\u2019t look angry, either. \u201cMia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cool, Madre,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jude wasn\u2019t quite sure how to respond, and here were her mirror-image kids, so alike they seemed to breathe in tandem, sitting slanted together, looking somehow both worried and defiant, waiting to hear her reaction to this news. They had hidden this from her, and it stung a little. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Mia flinched at that, and Jude knew she\u2019d been hurt by this, a little at least.</p><p>Jude let out her breath. This could be ruinous. What would happen if\u2014when\u2014Zach broke up with Lexi? What if Lexi stopped coming around? Mia would be heartbroken.</p><p>She chose her words carefully. \u201cObviously, Zach, I\u2019m not going to tell you who to date and who not to. But Lexi is important to all of us. You need to remember that she was Mia\u2019s best friend before you started dating her and she\u2019ll be Mia\u2019s best friend after it\u2019s over. And we don\u2019t keep secrets in this family. You know that. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He smiled brightly. As usual, he expected to get his way.</p><p>\u201cAnd about football practice. You will be on time to every practice from here on, and you will be without a car for the next week. I don\u2019t appreciate being lied to.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s smile fell. \u201cThat\u2019s bogus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs is lying,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Headlights flashed through the living room window, illuminating Zach and Mia for a moment.</p><p>The front door opened and Miles walked into the house, with a jacket slung over his shoulder and a novel under his arm. He came around the fireplace and saw them standing there in silence. He recognized trouble and frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Zach said. He looked at Mia and hitched his head. They ran upstairs and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Miles asked, tossing his sport coat onto the sofa. He went to the elegant mirrored bar in the corner of the room. A moment later he handed Jude a white wine.</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s dating,\u201d Jude said, thankful for the wine.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Miles said. \u201cThat was quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Miles took a moment to think about that. \u201cWell. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not okay. He\u2019s been skipping football practice.\u201d</p><p>Miles sat down beside her. \u201cI\u2019m sure you had one of your come-to-Jesus talks with him. He\u2019ll be back on track tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did he go off track? Zach\u2019s been dating a new girl every month since freshman year. As far as I know, he\u2019s never skipped anything to be with a girl. Lexi must be special. He actually used the word love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, worried it. \u201cI see problems here, Miles. Lexi\u2019s practically one of the family. And jealousy can be brutal\u2014remember how they used to fight over the Captain Hook action figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Captain Hook action figure. Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cThis is a delicate situation. A lot could go wrong.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a little indulgently. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about you, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can see the dark side of anything,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just started dating. How about holding off on an airstrike?\u201d</p><p>Jude smiled at that. She knew he was right\u2014she was overreacting. But a lot could go wrong with this new relationship. Hearts could be broken. Still, there was nothing she could do about it now. She went to her husband, put her arms around him, and looked up. \u201cYou are no help at all.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>The next morning, Jude woke to a cool and surprisingly sunny day. While Miles showered and dressed for work, she stood at her bedroom window, sipping coffee, trying to imagine how she could improve the borders in her garden. The lines weren\u2019t quite crisp enough, and she really wasn\u2019t happy with some of the lighting. It was too bad she hadn\u2019t noticed that in September. Now it was autumn, the rainy season, and gardening pretty much required a snorkel and mask.</p><p>Miles came up behind her, reached for her coffee cup and took a sip, then handed it back to her. \u201cLet me guess: you don\u2019t like the roses you planted last week and azaleas would be better.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. What are you going to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch with my mother.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t let her bully you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. I just have to get through it.\u201d Smiling at him, she went into the bathroom and took her shower. Afterward, she kissed Miles good-bye and started her day. She corralled the kids to breakfast, cleaned up the kitchen after them, and sent them to school with hugs and kisses.</p><p>She was out the door only an hour behind them. She dropped off Miles\u2019s dry cleaning, picked up some paperwork from the college counselor she\u2019d hired, got her nails done, returned the movies they\u2019d rented, and stopped by the grocery store to order a fresh, free-range, organic turkey for Thanksgiving.</p><p>With all those island stops, she made it to the ferry terminal with seconds to spare, driving right onto the boat. The channel crossing took less than forty minutes. In downtown Seattle, she found a parking spot a few blocks from the gallery and pulled in at exactly 12:06. Only a few minutes late.</p><p>On the sidewalk out front, she straightened, stiffened her spine, and set her chin up, like a prizefighter about to face a bigger opponent. In taupe wool pants and a creamy cashmere turtleneck, she knew she looked good ... but was it good enough for her mother\u2019s critical eye?</p><p>She sighed at that. It was ridiculous, all this worry about her mother. God knew Caroline didn\u2019t worry about Jude\u2019s opinion. She resettled her purse over her shoulder and headed to the gallery. On the wall out front, a discreet sign welcomed her to JACE.</p><p>She stepped inside. It was a big, brick-walled space, dotted with large mullioned windows. Gorgeous paintings hung one after another, illuminated with precision. As always, there was a sadness to the work that made Jude frown. It was all in greens and browns and grays.</p><p>\u201cJudith,\u201d her mother said, coming forward. She was dressed in slim black pants and a rose-colored silk blouse. A gorgeous stone necklace offset her green eyes. \u201cI expected you a few minutes ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTraffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Mother\u2019s smile was as brittle as old bones. \u201cI thought we could eat outside today. It\u2019s so unexpectedly lovely.\u201d Without waiting for a response, she led Jude through the gallery and up to the rooftop patio that overlooked Alaskan Way. From here, the view of Elliott Bay and Pine Island sparkled in the pale autumn sunlight. Large sculpted evergreens grew from huge terra-cotta pots. A table had been set with silver and crystal. Everything was perfect, as usual. Lovely, as her mother would have said.</p><p>Jude sat down, scooting in close.</p><p>Mother poured two glasses of wine and then sat down across from Jude. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, lifting a silver lid and serving up the salad ni\u00e7oise, \u201cwhat are you doing with yourself these days?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe kids are seniors in high school. That keeps me pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. What will you do when they go to college?\u201d</p><p>The remark was unsettling. \u201cI saw a master gardener class that looked interesting,\u201d she said, hearing\u2014and hating\u2014the anemic tone in her voice. Lately, she\u2019d begun to wonder exactly the same thing. What would she do when her children were gone?</p><p>Her mother looked at her. \u201cWould you ever consider managing JACE?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe gallery. I\u2019m getting older. Most of my friends retired long ago. You\u2019ve a good eye for talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... the gallery is your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Her mother sipped her wine. \u201cI suppose. Why couldn\u2019t it be yours as well?\u201d</p><p>Jude considered that. She had watched her mother work this gallery for years, giving up everything else in her life. She\u2019d even given up painting. Nothing mattered to her mother except the artists she chose and their work. It was an empty existence. And then there was the real problem: her mother would never quit, and the idea of working together was horrifying. They hadn\u2019t had an honest conversation in thirty-some years. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Mother put down her wine. \u201cMay I ask why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see us working well together. And I certainly can\u2019t see you actually retiring, Mother. What would you do?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother glanced away, looked out at the bay, where a boat was pulling up to the marina. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in years, Jude felt a kind of kinship with her mother. Both of them were facing changes in life, the natural consequences of aging. The difference between them was that Jude had people she loved around her. In that way, her mother was a cautionary tale. \u201cYou\u2019ll never quit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Now, let\u2019s eat. I only have forty minutes left. Really, Judith, you should try to be on time for our lunches...\u201d</p><p>They spent the next forty-four minutes making agonizing small talk; neither one really listened to the other. Long silences punctuated every comment, and in the quiet, Jude all too often recalled her lonely childhood. Years she\u2019d spent waiting for a kind word from this woman. When it was finally over, Jude said good-bye and left the gallery.</p><p>Outside, she stood on the street, unexpectedly unsettled. Her mother had struck a nerve with that what will you do? sentence, and it irritated Jude that she even cared. She walked down the busy street toward her car. She was almost there when she glanced in a window and stopped.</p><p>There, in a glass display case, was a gorgeous gold ring.</p><p>She went inside, looked closer. It was stunning: a perfect combination of edgy and sophisticated, modern and timeless. The shape was slightly asymmetrical, with a triangular flap on the top edge. The artist must have somehow wrapped heated metal around a form and then twisted it just enough to give the wide band a fun little tail. The empty jewel prong was also slightly off center.</p><p>Jude looked up. In response, an elegantly coifed older woman made almost no noise as she crossed the store and stepped gracefully behind the counter. \u201cHave you found something?\u201d</p> <p>Jude pointed at the ring.</p><p>\u201cAh. Exquisite.\u201d The saleswoman unlocked the glass case and withdrew the piece. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bazrah. One of a kind.\u201d She offered it to Jude, who slipped it on her forefinger.</p><p>\u201cIt would make a beautiful graduation gift for my daughter. What stone would you suggest setting in it?\u201d</p><p>The woman frowned in concentration. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have children, but if I were buying my daughter a ring like this, I think I\u2019d want to extend the experience. Perhaps you could choose the stone together.\u201d</p><p>Jude loved the idea. \u201cHow much is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hundred and fifty dollars,\u201d the saleswoman answered.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to look at something less\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is the ring I want. And could you show me some watches? For my son...\u201d</p><p>Jude spent another thirty minutes in the store, waiting for the inscriptions to be finished, then paid for her purchases and left.</p><p>She drove down to the waterfront and caught the three o\u2019clock ferry. At just before four, she was back on Pine Island, turning onto Night Road.</p><p>At home, she found Mia seated at the dining room table, with her laptop open, watching something on the screen.</p><p>\u201cI overacted in Our Town,\u201d Mia said miserably. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me? USC will hate this.\u201d</p><p>Jude went to Mia, stood beside her. \u201cGo to that scene in Streetcar, when you were on the balcony. That\u2019ll blow them away.\u201d</p><p>Mia took out one CD and put in another.</p><p>\u201cHow was school today?\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cMrs. Rondle gave us a pop quiz. So lame. And they announced the winter play. Romeo and Juliet, set during the Vietnam War. I can get the lead, which is cool. Zach is gonna take Lexi home after practice, but he\u2019ll be home for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Jude rubbed Mia\u2019s back. \u201cWhat do you think about Zach and Lexi being together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet it\u2019s killed you not to ask me that before.\u201d</p><p>Jude smiled. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s scary ... and sorta cool, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Jude thought about Mia before Lexi, when her daughter had been like a scared, fragile turtle with her head tucked deep inside her shell. Mia\u2019s only friends had been fictional. Lexi had changed all that. \u201cWhatever happens between them, you and Lexi have to stay honest with each other. You have to stay friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Zach breaks up with her. That\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it myself, believe me. But ... I think he really likes her. He talks about her all the time.\u201d</p><p>Jude stood there a minute longer, trying to figure out how to best bring up the other thing on her mind. Finally, she decided to just do it. \u201cThere\u2019s one other thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want to ask me again if Tyler and I are doing it? We\u2019re not.\u201d Mia laughed.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I fell in love. Keith Corcoran. Senior year of high school. Just like you. I didn\u2019t know until Keith kissed me how falling in love could be like riding a waterfall into warm water.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNo one talked to me about it. Grandma is a pretty buttoned-up woman. All she ever said to me about love was that it derailed a woman. So I learned on my own and, like everyone, I made some mistakes. And the world is more dangerous now. I don\u2019t want you to sleep with Tyler\u2014you\u2019re too young\u2014but...\u201d She went over to the second drawer beside the stove, opened it. She took out a small brown bag and handed it to Mia. \u201cThese are for you. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>Mia peered into the bag and saw the word condom printed on a brightly colored box. She gasped and clamped a hand over the bag. \u201cMo-om. Gross. We haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019ll need them. In fact, I hope you don\u2019t, but you know me. And I can see that you think you do love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need these,\u201d Mia mumbled. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d</p><p>Jude looked down at her daughter. Touching her chin, she forced Mia to look up at her. \u201cSex changes everything, Mia. It can be great for a relationship when you\u2019re ready\u2014older\u2014but it can be napalm when you\u2019re not ready. And baby, you\u2019re not ready. Just so you know.\u201d</p><p>By mid-November, every kid in the senior class was stressed out. The high school hallways were filled now with kids talking about colleges. Families spent weekends on the road, visiting campuses and talking to admissions counselors and trying to find the perfect fit.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s concerns\u2014and stresses\u2014were less complex. She didn\u2019t have some endless bank account from which to draw money, so her choices were limited to state schools. And sadly, since she\u2019d fallen in love, her grades had dropped. It wasn\u2019t much, just a tenth of a point, but in the dog-eat-dog world of college admissions, that was appreciable. Lately, when she was at the Farradays\u2019 or out with Zach and Mia and Tyler, she felt like some visitor from another country, unable to really comprehend their conversations. They all talked about USC and Loyola and NYU as if they were shoes you could point to and purchase.</p><p>Lexi could hardly comprehend that kind of confidence.</p><p>She stared down at the paperwork in front of her. Columns of calculations taunted her. No matter how hard she tried, there wasn\u2019t going to be enough money. Not for a four-year school. If she didn\u2019t get a governor\u2019s full-ride scholarship, she was out of the race.</p><p>Down the hall, a door opened.</p><p>Lexi looked up, saw Eva coming her way. \u201cYou\u2019ve been at that a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCollege is expensive,\u201d Lexi said with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI wish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I get to be this age with no money? I hate that I can\u2019t help you more.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt a rush of affection for this woman who had changed her life, given her a place to belong. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Eva. You\u2019ve given me everything that matters.\u201d</p><p>Eva looked down at her. She looked worried; the wrinkles around her mouth compressed into deep grooves. \u201cI talked to Barbara today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your sister? Still knitting enough blankets for a third world country?\u201d</p><p>Eva sat down across from Lexi. \u201cShe wants me to move to Florida with her\u2014after you graduate, of course. I wouldn\u2019t even think of it, but ... this weather is hell on my knees. We were thinking maybe you could come, too. There\u2019s a beauty school right down the road. That\u2019s a good trade. People always need their hair cut.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tried to smile. She wanted to, but couldn\u2019t quite find the strength. The idea of being without Eva was frightening, but Florida was so far away. How would she ever see Mia and Zach if she lived in Florida? And would she really have to choose between the people she loved? Was that part of growing up?</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re thinking of your young man. You goin\u2019 to school together, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll see each other on vacations, though. I\u2019ll be in Seattle and he\u2019ll come home to see his parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you got it all worked out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be careful, Lexi,\u201d Aunt Eva said quietly. \u201cI know what happens when boys get ready to go off to college. That\u2019s when girls make bad choices. Don\u2019t you be one of those girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Eva got slowly back to her feet. Lexi noticed how slowly her aunt moved now that the weather had turned cold. She patted Lexi\u2019s shoulder and headed over to the hook by the front door, where her blue Walmart smock hung, waiting. She slipped it on and then put on her coat. \u201cOff to work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got lots of Thanksgiving merch to display.\u201d She turned. \u201cI\u2019ll get us a turkey. We can have a dinner with all the trimmings. Would you like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLove it.\u201d</p><p>Eva opened the door and went out into the rainy darkness.</p><p>Only a moment or so later, there was a knock at the door. Her aunt must have forgotten something and locked herself out.</p><p>Lexi went to the door and opened it.</p><p>Zach stood on the top step, holding red roses. \u201cI thought she\u2019d never leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZach! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her until she was clinging to him like a drowning girl. \u201cI had to see you,\u201d he said finally, his breath as ragged as hers. Then he picked her up and carried her down the hallway. The whole house shook, and somewhere she dropped the flowers. He put her down on her narrow twin bed and covered her body with his, kissing her. When he pressed against her, she could feel his hardness through her jeans.</p><p>His tongue played with hers, and the feel of it pushed her toward something, a wanting\u2014a needing\u2014that was new and frightening and powerful. Without thinking about it, she pulled him onto her, so she could feel how much he wanted her.</p><p>He cursed and broke free, sliding off of her. At her confused frown, he tried to smile, but the look in his eyes was dark. She saw her own desire mirrored there. The difference was that he wasn\u2019t afraid. \u201cIt\u2019s better if we don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said shakily.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, pulling her sweater back down. Her eyes stung, and she didn\u2019t know why exactly, but she felt ashamed. She rolled onto her side, away from him. He tucked up against her, molded his body to hers.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so afraid of me, Lexi? I don\u2019t mean sex. I mean me. Why are you so sure I\u2019ll hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I love you, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Zach\u2019s view of love had been painted by his family; hers was a little darker. She knew how it felt to be abandoned by someone who\u2019d claimed love. \u201cJust hold me, Zach,\u201d she said, settling deeper into his arms.</p><p>As they lay there, she stared at the floor. A single rose lay on the industrial gray carpeting, stepped on, its bright red blossom tattered and torn.</p><p>With winter break came the first round of college deadlines. By the time classes ended on the twenty-third of December, Lexi had mailed in most of her applications, and the waiting game had begun. She often woke in the middle of the night, with her heart pounding, a nightmare of rejection still hanging in the back of her mind. Zach and Mia were stressed out, too, but it wasn\u2019t so bad for them. Sure, they wanted USC, but there were no bad answers waiting for them. The question for them wasn\u2019t if they\u2019d go to a four-year school; it was which one they would choose. The only one who seemed totally whacked out about the process was Jude, who couldn\u2019t seem to have a conversation that didn\u2019t include some college reference.</p><p>Tonight, Lexi was at the ice cream shop, working late. The school vacation gave business a shot in the arm. Families came downtown to Christmas shop, strolling from store to store beneath trees outlined in sparkling white lights.</p><p>She was ringing up a quart of fig and goat cheese ice cream when the phone rang. Thanking the well-dressed woman at the register, she answered, \u201cAmor\u00e9 Ice Cream Shop. This is Alexa. May I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLex, it\u2019s Mia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to call me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ottomans are gone for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKim\u2019s having a party. We\u2019ll pick you up at nine, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi,\u201d Mrs. Solter said firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s a business phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>Mia said, \u201cLater,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>Lexi went back to work. From then on, the minutes seemed to crawl forward on sore knees, but finally the ice cream shop was closed up and Lexi was outside in the cold, waiting. All around her, Christmas lights hung from eaves and wrapped around potted trees in front of the local businesses. Bright banners hung from the lampposts, fluttering in the night air, and a giant illuminated star hung above Main Street.</p><p>A red SUV pulled up in front of her. Mia opened the passenger door and leaned out. \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Lexi hurried around to the back door and climbed in the backseat, where Zach was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lexi,\u201d Tyler said from the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lexi said, cuddling up to Zach.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been together last night, studying with Mia in the Farradays\u2019 big media room (and making out whenever Mia left them alone), but it felt like a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cI called your aunt,\u201d Mia said. \u201cShe said it\u2019s cool if you stay at my house tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lexi leaned against Zach, rested her hand on his thigh.</p><p>She had to be touching him.</p><p>There were already about fifteen cars at the Ottoman house when they pulled up.</p><p>The four of them walked up the gravel driveway together. Noise from the party sounded muted and distant, until they stepped inside.</p><p>Music was playing at the edge of pain. The kitchen was wall-to-wall kids; a few more lay sprawled in the living room, making out, and through the glass pocket doors, they could see about ten more outside, standing around a fire.</p><p>Tyler pulled Mia into his arms and twirled her around, lifting her off her feet. Mia laughed and clung to him, and then they were kissing like crazy.</p><p>Zach took Lexi by the hand and led her out to the fire, where a group of football players were shotgunning beer.</p><p>\u201cZach ... Zach ... Zach...\u201d</p><p>The crowd chanted his name as they approached.</p><p>Bryson stepped forward, holding a Coors Light. \u201cBrewski, dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler\u2019s the d.d.,\u201d Zach said. \u201cHell, yeah.\u201d He took the beer, jammed a pen into its side, snapped the cap, and guzzled the whole thing in one shot. Wiping his mouth, he grinned at the crowd around him.</p><p>\u201cYou want one, Lexi?\u201d Bryson asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lexi,\u201d Zach said, rubbing her arm.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deny him. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll have a beer, but no shotgunning. I do my own laundry.\u201d</p><p>Zach laughed and called out for another beer.</p><p>For the next two hours, the party roared forward; the crowd grew louder and sloppier and drunker. Every now and then, the air smelled like pot. Someone was always laughing, and then, suddenly, the music changed.</p><p>The soundtrack from The Little Mermaid started. Throughout the house, guys\u2014including Zach\u2014groaned. Lexi grinned. \u201cI love it when a girl has the party.\u201d</p><p>Mia appeared out of nowhere. In her expensive pink terrycloth sweatpants and thick white hoodie, she looked rumpled and drunk, a little unsteady on her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s my song,\u201d she said, grabbing Lexi\u2019s hand, dragging her out onto the patio, where kids were dancing.</p><p>She hung on to Lexi, trying to move to the beat, but this close, Lexi could see how drunk Mia was, and how sad. \u201cMia? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler is all over Alaina Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re misreading the signs. You are pretty hammered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only shotgunned a few beers. And I\u2019m not overreacting.\u201d She leaned forward, whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2019cause she does it. All the guys know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he loves you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Mia said. \u201cThe point is, I love him. So what am I waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Before Lexi could answer, Tyler showed up and took Mia away, leading her off the makeshift dance floor. Lexi saw how pathetically happy Mia looked at his return. It saddened her because she knew how dangerous it was to love someone that much, and because she knew it was how she looked at Zach.</p><p>\u201cMy sister dumped you, huh?\u201d Zach said, coming up behind her, taking her in his arms. \u201cI would never do that to you.\u201d</p><p>She turned into him, kissing him. She tasted beer and something else, something sharp and metallic. The look in his eyes was a little bleary, as if he couldn\u2019t quite focus.</p><p>He kissed her again, deeply, and then, taking her hand, he led her through the party and down to the beach. He started kissing her even before they lay down. His hand slid up under her shirt, unhooked her bra. She knew she should stop him, but it felt so good, and when he touched her breasts, she felt as if she were floating, flying ... She made a sound she\u2019d never heard before. Behind them, distant now, the music changed, or went on, or even went off; she couldn\u2019t hear anything except her own heavy breathing and the way he kept saying her name and whispering that he loved her.</p><p>It took a Herculean effort to push him away. \u201cDon\u2019t, Zach...\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from her and lay there. She felt the loss of his touch as a physical pain, and she instantly regretted her move. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zach. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Mia said, stumbling toward them. In the moonlight, Lexi could see how glassy eyed Mia was now, almost as if she\u2019d been crying. And she was unsteady on her feet. Her shirt was buttoned incorrectly; the way it hung on her thin frame made her look strangely bent. She plopped down beside Lexi.</p><p>Lexi tried to rehook her bra without anyone noticing.</p><p>Zach sat up, drew his knees in, and stared out at the black Sound. After a long silence, he said quietly, \u201cMia? I don\u2019t want to leave Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to go,\u201d Mia said, leaning against Lexi. She looked at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s not one yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn August,\u201d Zach said. He looked to her for support, but she could offer none. She was suspended, in a dangerous position between these two, both of whom she loved. \u201cCouldn\u2019t we all go to UW together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not be able to go to the U,\u201d Lexi said to him. \u201cIt\u2019s so expensive. I might have to start at Seattle CC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could do that, too,\u201d Zach said. \u201cIt would save Mom and Dad a ton of money.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked at her brother. \u201cNow you don\u2019t want to go to USC with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave Lex,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Mia looked away, stared out at the water. \u201cOh,\u201d was all she said, but in that little half word, Lexi heard an ocean of disappointment.</p><p>They all knew Mia needed Zach at college with her.</p><p>Tyler stumbled over to where they were and collapsed into the sand. \u201cHey, Mia,\u201d he said drunkenly, reaching for her. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Zach said. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tyler laughed. \u201cOh, yeah. Whoa. I can\u2019t drive, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Lexi got to her feet and looked at the party. Kids were sprawled everywhere. The few who were still standing staggered around. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she said, starting to panic. \u201cWe don\u2019t want your mom to know we were drinking...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Zach said again, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cMadre said we could call anytime,\u201d Mia said, trying to get Tyler to his feet. \u201cNo questions asked, she said. No repercussions.\u201d</p> <p>Zach looked at Lexi.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she said. This was bad.</p><p>He cursed again and made the call. \u201cHey, Mom,\u201d he said, straightening, trying to sound sober and failing. \u201cYeah. I know. Sorry. But ... we need you to pick us up ... yeah ... Tyler ... I know ... thanks.\u201d He closed the phone and looked at them. \u201cShe sounded pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one in the morning,\u201d Lexi said. If only she hadn\u2019t had that beer. She could have driven them home and spared them all what was coming.</p><p>They made their way back to the house, where kids were still huddled around the fire. All around, on the grass, more kids were making out, passed out.</p> <p>In the driveway, they stood by Tyler\u2019s SUV. It seemed to take forever, but finally a pair of headlights appeared on the rise, turned toward them, and grew brighter.</p><p>The big black Escalade parked. Jude stepped out of the driver\u2019s seat and came around to them. She was wearing a heavy, floor-length cashmere robe over pajamas. Without makeup, she looked pale and tired. And pissed off. Her gaze narrowed as she looked them over. Lexi had no doubt that she saw it all: Mia\u2019s glassy eyes and misbuttoned shirt, Zach\u2019s unsteady stance, Tyler\u2019s droopy eyes.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t make eye contact she was so embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Jude said with a sigh. \u201cPut on your seatbelts.\u201d</p><p>The drive home was utterly silent. When they were all in the entryway, Jude said, \u201cPut Tyler in the media room. He can sleep on the sofa. Now I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d On that, she turned her back on them and walked down the hall. At her bedroom door, she paused, turned back. \u201cGood job for calling,\u201d she said tiredly, and then she went into her room and closed the door.</p><p>Mia immediately giggled. Zach shushed her, and they all climbed the stairs to the second floor. Tyler fell a couple of times, yelling out curses. By the time they got him onto the sofa, he was already asleep.</p> <p>At Mia\u2019s bedroom door, Zach kissed Lexi until she couldn\u2019t think straight, and then left her.</p><p>She and Mia crawled into the big king-sized bed. Moonlight spilled through the window, illuminating them.</p><p>\u201cYour mom looked pretty pissed tonight,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. We did the right thing. She wouldn\u2019t want us driving.\u201d</p><p>Lexi lay back into the pile of soft pillows, staring up at the dark, peaked ceiling. \u201cAbout what Zach said ... about school...\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to follow that up. The dream was too sharp to handle.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is...\u201d Mia sighed. \u201cI want to go to USC. I actually dream about it. You know? But I\u2019m afraid to go without Zach. I wish I were stronger ... but I\u2019m not. I need him with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled onto her side and looked at Lexi. \u201cI have a secret. About Tyler and me.\u201d She paused. \u201cWe did it.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi rolled over to face Mia. \u201cIt? You did it?\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s face was so close Lexi could smell the beer on her breath and the floral scent of her shampoo. Her green eyes were bright. \u201cHe said he loved me. I know it\u2019s true now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails!\u201d Lexi said, trying to keep her voice a whisper. As she listened to Mia\u2019s story, Lexi couldn\u2019t help thinking about Zach and how much she loved him, and she wished she hadn\u2019t pushed him away now.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re officially the last virgin in our class,\u201d Mia finally said.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes, feeling strangely adrift, as if she\u2019d missed some boat that everyone else was on. What if Zach only said he understood her reluctance? What if someday he just ... found someone else to love?</p><p>Beside her, Mia started to snore.</p><p>Lexi thought about sneaking out of bed and going to Zach\u2019s room. She\u2019d never done that before\u2014she\u2019d promised both Jude and Mia that she wouldn\u2019t do it\u2014and usually it was an easy promise to keep. But tonight, she felt his absence keenly. They had so little time together. It was late December already. No matter what they all said\u2014what they dreamed aloud\u2014they wouldn\u2019t be going to school together. Beginning in September, they would only see one another on breaks. If then.</p><p>She closed her eyes and dreamed of Zach, remembering the times on their beach ...</p><p>\u201cLexi. LEXI.\u201d</p><p>She came awake with a start.</p><p>Zach was peering down at her, his blond hair falling forward. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand. It was just that simple. He pressed a finger to his lips, said sshhh as they tiptoed down the hall toward his room.</p><p>She could have stopped him, pulled back as she\u2019d done so many times before, but suddenly all her reasons for holding back felt silly. Whatever he wanted, she wanted. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought that she might lose him. She wanted to be everything to him while she could, so he would keep on loving her.</p><p>She followed him up onto his big bed, with its impossibly soft sheets and the airy goose-down pillows. Moonlight spilled through the open window, pooling on the white cotton.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing her a small pink-wrapped box.</p><p>\u201cChristmas isn\u2019t for two days. I don\u2019t have your present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might not have another chance to be alone,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her hands were shaking slightly as she opened the box. Inside, on blue velvet, lay a thin silver band with a tiny sapphire chip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise ring,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cThe lady at the store said it\u2019s what you give the girl you love. It means I want to marry you someday.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stared down at it, feeling tears start behind her eyes. He did love her. As much as she loved him. When she lifted her gaze, all the love she\u2019d hoarded since childhood was in her eyes. She gave all of it to him, all of herself. \u201cDo you have some condoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is what you want?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if you aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she whispered, taking off his shirt. \u201cLove me, Zach. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Jude had very few Christmas memories from her childhood. Here was what she remembered: quiet mornings in the big house on Magnolia Bluff, a fake tree decorated by professionals, a single designer stocking hanging from the mantel. Breakfast had been catered. There had been gift openings, of course\u2014a short, silent affair with Caroline sitting perched on an expensive gilt chair, her foot tapping nervously on the hardwood, while Jude sat cross-legged on the floor. A few solemn thank-yous were passed back and forth, and then the whole ordeal was done. When the last gift was revealed, her mother had practically run for the door.</p><p>Once, when her father had been alive, she recalled writing a letter to Santa ... but that kind of whimsy had died with her dad.</p><p>Jude did things a little differently in her own home. Since motherhood had surprised her with its powerful pull, she\u2019d become a holiday junkie. She decorated from corner to corner, until the entire house looked like a catalog spread. But it was Christmas morning that she really looked forward to, when the family came together, their cheeks creased from sleep, to open presents. In those early morning hours, with her sleepy, grinning children settled around her, she could see the result of her efforts. Her twins would remember these times with fondness.</p><p>Now, though, the boxes and papers and bows were put away, and they were at the table, eating their traditional holiday meal\u2014eggs Florentine with fresh fruit and homemade cinnamon rolls.</p><p>Last night, in a burst of holiday cheer, snow had come to the Northwest, and the view outside was a gorgeous tableau of white and blue.</p><p>Jude had always loved snow days, and when they came for the holidays, it was a double bonus. Today, after brunch, the whole family was going ice skating down at the pond on Miller Road. It would be a good time, she thought, to have a serious talk with the kids about what had happened the other night at the party. It had taken a superhuman effort not to rail at them, but she had managed it. Still, there was some talking to be done, some ground rules for senior year to be reassigned.</p><p>She was so deep in imagining how she would conduct this conversation, what she would say to them, that she hardly heard what Zach had just said.</p><p>She turned to her son, who was busily buttering one of the cinnamon rolls she\u2019d made. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Zach grinned. From across the glittering expanse of their formal dining table, with his blond hair messy from sleep, he looked about thirteen years old. \u201cA promise ring.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell. Even Miles frowned. His hand paused midreach. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Across the table from Zach, Mother straightened. \u201cExcuse me, did you say a ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty,\u201d Mia said, pulling a frosted bit from her cinnamon roll. She popped it into her mouth. \u201cMom? Are you having a stroke?\u201d</p><p>Jude had to force herself to remain calm. Her son\u2014her not quite eighteen-year-old son\u2014had given his girlfriend a ring for Christmas. \u201cAnd what exactly are you promising Lexi?\u201d She felt Miles lean toward her. His fingers closed around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cIt means I promise to marry her someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, look. We\u2019re out of fruit,\u201d Miles said evenly. \u201cHere, Jude. I\u2019ll help you get some more.\u201d Before she could protest\u2014she still felt frozen\u2014he led her out of the dining room and into the big kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said, pulling her behind the fridge. \u201cThey\u2019ll hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d she said. \u201cI want him to hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t come down on him about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s okay for our son to give a promise ring to a girl he\u2019s been dating for three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s done, Jude. A fait accompli.\u201d</p><p>She pushed his arm away. \u201cGreat parenting, Miles. Do nothing. What if we\u2019d found out he was doing heroin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not heroin, Jude,\u201d he said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s love. Or so he thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is love, Jude. You can tell that by looking at the kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have this debate with you. If you want to throw yourself on the sword, go ahead, but don\u2019t expect me to suture you up when you start bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a mountain out of a molehill. He was in a jewelry store, shopping for a present for his girlfriend, and he got swept away by romance. That\u2019s all. It happens to men, too, unevolved as we are.\u201d He pulled her toward him. \u201cSadly, our son is an idiot. They should have told us this when he was born. That way we could have lowered our expectations.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare make me smile.

Stop worrying. This is nothing. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI will keep my opinion to myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, smiling indulgently. \u201cAnd you\u2019re so good at that.\u201d</p><p>Jude sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll try. But I\u2019ll tell you this, Miles. They better go to separate schools.\u201d</p><p>Moving with an uncustomary stiffness, Jude went back into the great room and returned to her place at the end of the table. Miles held out her chair for her and squeezed her shoulder as she sat down.</p><p>The mood had changed. There was no mistaking the sudden quiet. Mia and Zach were both looking at her with the wariness of the guilty.</p><p>She managed a tight smile and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you just love it when it snows for Christmas?\u201d</p><p>Someone answered\u2014honestly, she barely knew who it was. Perhaps her mother, saying something about the weather.</p> <p>Jude\u2019s hands were trembling just a little, and if she were a woman who had to worry about her blood pressure, she would have worried now. She understood suddenly why so many of her friends had warned her about the stresses of senior year. It was only December, and already their lives felt out of kilter, as if the warm water that had always buoyed them up had abruptly begun to drain away. There was danger in shallow water, unseen shoals. Like love and parties and children who lied to you.</p><p>\u201cI need to return that pink sweater,\u201d Mia said at one point. \u201cIt\u2019s way too big. I want to get something to wear to Timmy\u2019s party on Saturday. You want to come to the mall with me, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked up. \u201cTimmy\u2019s party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on Saturday, remember?\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cYou two are not going to a party on Saturday,\u201d Jude said, stunned that they would even think to ask.</p><p>Zach looked up sharply. \u201cYou said we could go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before you called me, drunk, at one-twenty to come pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said we should call you,\u201d Zach said. \u201cI knew we\u2019d get into trouble for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou let them go to a party?\u201d her mother said, her carefully arched eyebrows raised. \u201cWith alcohol?\u201d</p><p>Jude drew a deep breath and exhaled it to stay calm. The last thing she needed now was parenting advice from a woman who\u2019d handled motherhood as if it were radioactive waste. \u201cYou did the right thing by calling. I\u2019m glad you did. But you also got drunk, and that\u2019s the wrong thing. We\u2019ve talked about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe learned our lesson,\u201d Zach said. \u201cWe won\u2019t drink again. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. This is the last week of winter break, and I want to spend it as a family. We\u2019re going to Molly and Tim\u2019s tomorrow, and your grandmother\u2019s gallery is having a special show on Monday night. Ty and Lexi are welcome to come over as much as you want them to, but no party on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Zach started to come out of his chair. Miles put a hand on his son\u2019s shoulder, guided him back down.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Zach muttered, slumping into his seat, scowling.</p><p>Jude tried to find a smile again and couldn\u2019t. Maybe God had designed senior year so that mothers like her could let their children leave home. If this kept up, it would be easier than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>In January, on the last day of winter break, precipitation began as an icy, misting rain but quickly transformed into lacy white flakes that frosted fence posts and telephone wires. Soon, the roads were thick with new snow and red safety cones appeared at the bottom of steep hills. Kids bundled up and went out to sled on the barricaded hills; their moms stood by in groups, talking among themselves and taking pictures.</p><p>Lexi and Zach were at her house, snuggled up together in her twin bed. On her bedside table, a scented candle burned brightly, dispelling the slightly damp-smelling air that always came to the mobile home when the windows were shut.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt will be home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine soon.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at him and smacked his arm, then rolled away and got out of bed. \u201cYou promised your mom you\u2019d finish your college apps today, and she\u2019s been so pissed off lately, I don\u2019t want to make her mad again. So move it.\u201d She got dressed and headed for the door. She meant to walk right out of her bedroom and go straight to the kitchen table, where the paperwork for college was arranged in neat piles.</p><p>At the last minute, she weakened and turned around.</p><p>He lay in her bed, naked, her tattered blue comforter across his hips, his bare feet stuck out from the end. His smile worked its magic; she moved toward him. When she got close, he reached up and curled his warm hand around the back of her neck, pulling her down for a kiss. Just before his lips touched hers, she heard him say, \u201cI love you so much.\u201d It took all her willpower not to crawl back in bed with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sex maniac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>Something about his smile, or the green of his eyes and the love she saw, something caught her then. How could she let him go away to college? Just walk away from her?</p><p>\u201cCome on. I want your mom to keep liking me, and I told her I would make sure you finished the USC app today. You know she\u2019s going to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I just missed the deadline?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Now get your ass up. You need to finish putting everything together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur last day of break and we have to do stupid shit,\u201d Zach grumbled, throwing the covers back. He saw the way she reacted to his nakedness and he grinned wolfishly, but before he could say anything, Lexi left the bedroom and sat down at the kitchen table.</p><p>Zach slid into a seat beside her, propping his elbow on the table. \u201cLex?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go wherever you go. Really.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and kissed her, and she thought about how it would feel to let him go, to say good-bye. It was all well and good for him to say he wanted to be with her, but that was a distant cousin to going with her. To be with Lexi, he\u2019d have to stand up to his parents and disappoint Mia, who was more than just a sister. It would never happen, so there was no point dreaming about it.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to piss your mom off again. Let\u2019s finish up and get going. Mia says everyone is sledding on Turner Hill.\u201d</p><p>In February, Zach and Mia turned eighteen. The magic number convinced them that they were adults; suddenly they questioned every rule and restriction. Curfews struck them as irrelevant now, unnecessary. They were constantly testing the limits and wanting more freedom.</p><p>As the weather warmed, class parties sprung up like mushrooms on the roadside. Blooming instantly. All it took was a phone call and a fake ID in someone\u2019s hand. My parents are gone became the class motto, the equivalent of a clan call. Kids arrived at empty houses or on the beach or in the woods with fifths and six-packs and Baggies of pot. Some parents chose to host the parties themselves, rigorously taking car keys, but if no \u201ccool\u201d parent could be found, well, the party must go on.</p><p>The whole scenario had exhausted Jude, worn her to a frazzle. She felt more like a warden than a parent, and the constant battling with her twins about safety and compromise and good choices had weakened her. She no longer believed them when they said they wouldn\u2019t drink. At first she had clamped down, denied them, but that had only driven them to sneak out, which led to more clamping down\u2014and more angry rebellion. Every day felt like a mountain to climb, every night they spent at home a triumph.</p><p>On top of all that was the college pressure. It had become a cauldron that held them all, parents and kids; the water was heating up fast. One question was asked over and over: have you heard? It was asked mother to mother at Safeway, in line at the post office, or on the ferry.</p><p>Honestly, Jude was as nervous as her kids about it.</p><p>Even now, on this gorgeous March afternoon, when she should have been gardening, she was standing at the window, staring up the driveway. It was almost three-thirty. The kids had just gotten home from school. They\u2019d torn through the kitchen like locusts and then gone upstairs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing a groove in the floor,\u201d Miles said from the living room, where he was reading the newspaper. He had had a surgery cancelled today and come home from the hospital early.</p><p>She saw a flash of white.</p><p>The mail was here.</p><p>She grabbed her coat and stepped into the garden clogs on the porch and headed up the gravel driveway. At the top of the hill, she pulled open the mailbox and saw what she\u2019d been waiting for.</p><p>A nice thick envelope with the USC emblem on the upper left corner.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t absolute proof, of course, the thickness of the envelope, but everyone knew it took a lot of pages to welcome a student and only one to reject.</p><p>Then it struck her. One envelope.</p><p>She let out a sigh and reached for the rest of the mail.</p><p>And there it was. At the bottom of the stack.</p><p>A second thick envelope with the same logo.</p><p>Jude hurried back down the driveway. Once inside the house, she yelled out for the kids.</p><p>\u201cDid something come?\u201d Miles asked, taking off his reading glasses.</p><p>Jude tossed the heap of mail on the entry table and showed him the two special envelopes. \u201cMail call,\u201d she said, feeling suddenly nervous. She had to say it twice\u2014yell it, really\u2014and then the kids came hurrying down the stairs.</p><p>Jude handed Zach the envelope with his name on it.</p><p>Mia snatched the other envelope, ripping it open as she walked away. Not more than ten feet away, she spun around. \u201cThey accepted me!\u201d A grin burst across her face and then faded as she looked at her brother. \u201cZach?\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>Please, Jude prayed. Let it be both of them.</p><p>Zach opened the envelope and read the letter. \u201cThey accepted me.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s shriek could have shattered glass. She launched herself forward to sweep Zach and Mia into a family hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you guys.\u201d She waited for Zach to hug her, but he was too stunned to move. Finally, she stepped back, beaming at them. \u201cBoth of you at USC. It\u2019s your dream come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to call Lexi and Ty,\u201d Mia said. She grabbed Zach\u2019s hand and pulled him toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAnd the crowd goes wild. Come on, Mama Bear,\u201d Miles said, coming to stand beside her. \u201cI\u2019ll pour us champagne.\u201d</p><p>Jude stared up the empty stairs. \u201cWhy are we the only ones celebrating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not. They\u2019re upstairs calling all their friends with the good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat blows,\u201d she said, looping her arms around his waist and looking up at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndeed. Most of parenthood does. But we can still celebrate.\u201d He kissed her lightly on the lips. \u201cMaybe now you can relax.\u201d</p><p>After last period, Lexi went to the counselor\u2019s office. It was a small narrow room lined on all sides with bookshelves. In those shelves, there were literally thousands of college manuals.</p><p>She sat in a blue plastic chair, waiting.</p><p>At just past three-thirty, the receptionist looked up from her desk. \u201cLexi, Mrs. Morford can see you now.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi nodded and slung her heavy backpack over her shoulder. She walked down the narrow, college-poster-lined hallway and stepped into the office in the back. Through the window, she could see the gym and a pair of skinny kids\u2014probably freshmen\u2014playing Hacky Sack.</p><p>Lexi sat down opposite the large brown desk that dominated the room. Her counselor, Mrs. Morford, sat behind it.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Miz Morford.\u201d Lexi reached into her backpack and pulled out two thick envelopes. Inside were acceptances from the UW and Western Washington. She handed them to her counselor, who read the letters and then set them down.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Lexi. Now, what can I do for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth schools offered me scholarships. Two thousand dollars. But ... look at the costs. The UW tuition is fifty-three hundred, room and board is sixty-two hundred, and books are another thousand. That\u2019s more than thirteen thousand dollars. How can I get more help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about this when your grades dropped last semester, Lexi. The UW and WWU are extremely competitive schools. There are several island scholarships you can apply for, though, and you could always take out a loan. They have some really good educational programs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to borrow ten thousand dollars a year. And even then I\u2019d have to work all through school. I\u2019d be in debt when I graduated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of people go through college on loans, Lexi. It\u2019s a way of betting on your own future.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sighed. \u201cI guess community college isn\u2019t so bad. I can go to the UW in two years.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Morford nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to save money. Two years will go by fast. In no time you\u2019ll be back with your friends.\u201d</p> <p>Not the ones who mattered.</p><p>Lexi thanked the counselor and walked down to her bus stop. All the way home, she worked and reworked the numbers, trying to magically refashion it all into a plan she could make work.</p><p>But there was no making it work. Short of borrowing a ton of money, she was not going to a four-year school.</p><p>By the time she was home, she was thoroughly depressed. Never had she felt as much of an outsider on Pine Island as she did now. She would have given almost anything for the choices most island kids took for granted.</p><p>At home, she went straight into her room and flopped onto the bed.</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>She answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi! Zach and I got into USC. Both of us. And Tyler got into UCLA. Isn\u2019t that awesome? Can you come out to dinner with us tonight? We\u2019re celebrating!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Lexi banged her head against the headboard. She should just drown herself. Tears stung her eyes. She wasn\u2019t one to feel sorry for herself, but why couldn\u2019t life go her way JUST ONCE? \u201cOf course I\u2019ll celebrate with you.\u201d</p><p>Mia launched into another college story and Lexi couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She mumbled some excuse and hung up on her best friend.</p><p>A few minutes later, a knock at her bedroom door surprised Lexi. \u201cC-come in,\u201d she said, sitting up in bed.</p><p>Eva walked into the small, cramped room. The walls were covered with photographs: there were pictures of Zach playing football, of Mia waterskiing, of the three of them at the homecoming dance. \u201cThese walls are paper thin. I heard you crying.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wiped her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Eva sat down on the side of the bed. \u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Lexi knew she looked awful. Her eyes were puffy and red from crying. \u201cZach and Mia got into USC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want them to get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Just saying it made her feel miserable and small. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that when he leaves...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I met my Oscar when I was sixteen and he was twenty-eight. Ooh-ee, was it a mess, I can tell you. A sixteen-year-old girl isn\u2019t supposed to know what she wants, and a man that age ain\u2019t supposed to want her at all.\u201d She sighed, smiling. \u201cMy daddy woulda shot Oscar if he\u2019d showed his face at our place, so we waited. Oscar was in the service, and he went away for a few years. We wrote letters back and forth. Then on the day I turned eighteen, I married him. During Vietnam, we were apart again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you make it through all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about being at the same school or the same town or even the same room, Lexi. It\u2019s about being together. Love is a choice you make. And I know you\u2019re young, but that don\u2019t mean a thing. Do you believe in how you feel? That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the same thing? You might think on that.\u201d Eva patted her hand and stood up. \u201cWell. If I don\u2019t head out now, I\u2019ll be late for the night shift. Do you have plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Farradays want to celebrate tonight. They invited me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the most sensitive thing I\u2019ve ever heard. You okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be,\u201d Lexi said. When her aunt got to the door, Lexi said, \u201cThanks, Eva.\u201d</p><p>Eva waved a gnarled hand as if to say, humpf!, and left the room.</p><p>Alone again, Lexi looked at the pictures and clippings on her wall. Then, with a last tired sigh, she got up, made her bed, and headed down the hall.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later\u2014right on time\u2014she was sitting in the living room, waiting. She had put on her best dress and taken extra time with her hair and makeup. When she was done, no evidence of her emotional meltdown remained.</p><p>Outside, a car pulled up. Headlights shone into the living room and then clicked off.</p><p>She meant to get up, but she couldn\u2019t seem to move.</p><p>The knock on the front door rattled the whole mobile home.</p><p>Finally, she made herself rise, move, open the door. Zach and Mia stood there.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d Mia said, launching herself forward to hug Lexi, who did her best to reciprocate.</p><p>Lexi dared to look over Mia\u2019s shoulder at Zach, who looked as devastated as she felt.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said woodenly.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Lexi felt Mia take her hand, and she let her best friend lead her down the wooden steps and across the wet grass to the waiting Escalade, where the three of them got into the backseat, with Lexi in the middle, as usual.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lexi,\u201d Miles said, looking at her in the rearview mirror. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you could join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never miss a celebration like this,\u201d she said, managing a smile.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all celebrating,\u201d Mia said. \u201cLexi got scholarships to the UW and WWU. It\u2019s a dream come true, right, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dream come true,\u201d Lexi agreed tiredly.</p><p>After they picked up Tyler, the conversation kicked into high gear. All the way to the restaurant, Mia and Jude talked about USC and Los Angeles and what it would be like to hang out on the beaches of Southern California. Every sentence began with some version of It\u2019ll be so cool ...</p><p>Zach held Lexi\u2019s hand, squeezing it just a little too hard.</p><p>Finally, as they pulled up to the restaurant and parked, Lexi dared to look at him.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to go, he mouthed. But he would, and they both knew it.</p><p>May came to the Pacific Northwest like a favorite relative, bringing sunshine. Gone were the perennial gray skies and ceaseless, dripping rain. Overnight, it seemed, color returned to this misty landscape. All over the island, curtains that had long been ignored were thrown open, barbeques were wheeled out of their garage hideaways, and patio furniture was uncovered and scrubbed clean. It was a glorious leonine month always, a bright respite before the pale gloom of June, and this year it was particularly bold. The combination of an egg-yolk sun and a surprising heat brought kids pouring into beach parks and bike paths.</p><p>On Saturday, the fifteenth, Lexi woke early. It had been a restless night, full of bad dreams about planes that taxied down runways and rose into cloudy skies. She padded out of her bedroom and headed down the hall.</p><p>Eva was waiting for her in the kitchen, wearing her old white chenille bathrobe and a pointed metallic hat. On the table beside her were two glazed donuts on yellow paper plates; one had a twisty blue candle in it. \u201cHappy birthday,\u201d she said, blowing on a noisemaker.</p><p>Lexi almost burst into tears. In all the college drama, she\u2019d forgotten about her eighteenth birthday. But Eva had remembered.</p><p>\u201cI got you two presents this year.\u201d Eva cocked her head to indicate the wrapped packages on the table.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t help remembering her birthdays before Eva\u2014long, unhappy days spent waiting alone for a mother who never showed. She kissed her aunt\u2019s wrinkled, velvety cheek and then took a seat at the table.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Eva said, taking a seat across from Lexi.</p><p>Lexi enthusiastically started unwrapping the paper. Inside the box lay a sapphire blue cotton sweater with tiny silver buttons. She held it up, admiring it. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it don\u2019t fit, we can exchange it at the store.\u201d</p><p>Lexi would never return it, even if it were two sizes too small. It would always be in her top drawer, alongside the pink bedazzled butterfly sweatshirt she\u2019d outgrown. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Eva. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Eva nodded. \u201cOpen that one.\u201d</p><p>The other gift was about the size of a tablet of paper, and slim. Lexi opened it carefully and lifted the lid.</p><p>On the top was a four-color brochure for an apartment complex in Pompano Beach, Florida. \u201cFun in the sun,\u201d it promised, in big, bold type. Below it was a class catalog from Broward Community College.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Barbara\u2019s apartment building,\u201d Eva said, leaning forward. \u201cI got to thinking about your future, and I thought, hell\u2019s bells, why couldn\u2019t you come to Florida with me? Barbara\u2019s got two bedrooms, and her and I have shared a bedroom before. You could have your own room and go to classes during the day. You wouldn\u2019t have to pay any rent at all.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked across the table at this woman who had done so much for her, and her throat tightened. \u201cIt looks great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shoulda known you wouldn\u2019t want beauty school. Barbara told me as much. You\u2019re the first one of us ever to go to college. College,\u201d Eva said the word reverently. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of you. And you need to get to know your other aunt. Her kids and grandkids are dying to meet you.\u201d She patted Lexi\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you got your boy to think about, but he\u2019s goin\u2019 off somewhere with his sister. So I wanted you to know you had me to think about, too. You aren\u2019t alone anymore, Alexa. Not unless you want to be. Now, let\u2019s eat these donuts. I got to be at work soon. Make a wish and blow out your candle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A wish.</p><p>Lexi stared into the small flame dancing above the twisted blue candle.</p><p>There was only one wish, and it wouldn\u2019t come true, but she made it anyway.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Lexi. I hope your birthday wish comes true.\u201d</p> <p>After that, they ate their donuts, toasted her birthday again with glasses of milk, and went their separate ways\u2014Eva to a Saturday shift at Walmart, Lexi to the ice cream shop. For the rest of the day, Lexi was in constant motion. On a sunny weekend like this, the shop was crazy busy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t slow down again until evening, when Zach and Mia picked her up from work.</p><p>Lexi did her best to be cheerful around both of them. She laughed and joked and talked at the dinner table, but when Jude brought out a cake with candles, her fragile veneer cracked a little and it took willpower not to cry or run away.</p><p>Next year, she would celebrate her birthday by herself. Mia and Zach would be in sunny Southern California, living the college dream. She wanted to be happy for them, she really did. But she kept glimpsing the future that lay like a storm cloud on the horizon. Oh, they talked about staying in touch and keeping their lives braided together, and their intentions would be as true as their emotions, but it wouldn\u2019t be enough. When she told them about Eva\u2019s Florida offer, they both groaned aloud and begged her not to go so far away. They wanted to see her on school breaks.</p><p>Easy for them to ask. But she wanted that, too.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna be like?\u201d Mia asked that night as the three of them lay together on blankets on the beach. It was the first time one of them had dared to ask the question aloud.</p><p>They were holding hands, staring up at the stars.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming about it for so long,\u201d Mia said. \u201cBut now that it\u2019s getting close, I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Lexi heard Zach sigh beside her. Because she loved him, she knew what that sound meant: he was stuck in the middle. He loved Lexi\u2014she knew that, believed it with every part of her soul\u2014but he and Mia were more than connected. They were twins, with all that the word implied. They could read each other\u2019s thoughts. And really, one of the things Lexi loved most about Zach was how much he cared about the people he loved. He hated hurting anyone. Mia most of all.</p><p>That was why he was going to USC. No matter how much he loved Lexi, he loved Mia and his parents even more. He couldn\u2019t disappoint them. And he worried that Mia was too shy to make it at USC on her own.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll still be friends forever,\u201d Lexi said. She wanted it to be true, needed it to be.</p> <p>Beside her, she heard Mia draw in a breath and quietly start to cry.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Sadness rose up in Lexi, and before she knew it, she was crying, too. \u201cWe ... we\u2019re dorks,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes, and although it was true, and it made her smile, she still couldn\u2019t stop crying. She loved both of them and soon they\u2019d be gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, Lexi,\u201d Mia said. She rolled over and hugged Lexi and then rolled over onto her back again.</p><p>Overhead, the night sky loomed, as incomprehensible as their futures; beneath it, Lexi knew how small they were.</p><p>Zach pulled his hand out of Lexi\u2019s grasp and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Then he got up and hurried back to the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call me tons, right?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>Mia squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll be like Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox. Bffs forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam and Frodo. Harry and Hermione.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi and Mia,\u201d Mia said. \u201cJust think: someday we\u2019ll be old together and we\u2019ll laugh about how scared we were to go off to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz we\u2019ll still be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Lexi fell silent. She\u2019d learned a long time ago that there were things she might want but would never have, and it hurt less if she tried not to want what was unattainable. Was this friendship like that? Was this just a high school friend version of first love that would diminish into a fond memory with time and distance?</p><p>Zach ran back, slightly out of breath. He stood above them, a silhouette against the moonlit waves. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Mia demanded.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t ask why; she just got up and took his hand. She loved the way his strong, warm fingers curled around hers.</p><p>He held out a Ninja Turtles Thermos. \u201cI have an idea. Move your ass, Mia, and quit asking questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone thinks he\u2019s the boss of me,\u201d Mia said as she got to her feet and brushed the sand off her backside.</p><p>Zach led them down to the big cedar tree that guarded their beach.</p><p>In the moonlight, he looked pale, almost ghostlike, but there was a brightness in his green eyes that shone like tears.</p><p>He held out the Thermos and opened it. \u201cWe\u2019ll put something in here and bury it.\u201d He stared at Lexi. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ... like ... our pact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor as long as this time capsule is buried here, we\u2019ll be best friends,\u201d Mia said seriously. \u201cGoing off to college won\u2019t change that. Nothing will change it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be like everyone else,\u201d Lexi said, hoping her comment didn\u2019t sound like a question, but even now, in this solemn moment, she had trouble believing. Everything came so easily to these two. \u201cWe\u2019ll never really say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Mia nodded. \u201cNot as long as this is buried.\u201d</p><p>Zach held out the open Thermos. Moonlight caught a flash of the silver interior and made it glow. \u201cPut something in here as proof.\u201d</p><p>At another time, in another place, it might have been funny or melodramatic or just plain silly, but not here, not now, in this darkness that felt weighted by the future that was bearing down on them like an eighteen-wheeler.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lex,\u201d Zach said. \u201cCollege won\u2019t change that. We\u2019ll stay in love. Always.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stared at him. It felt like they were connected, drawing one breath back and forth.</p><p>Mia dropped a pair of expensive gold earrings into the Thermos.</p><p>Zach took off the Saint Christopher medal he always wore and dropped it inside.</p><p>All Lexi had was the string friendship bracelet Mia had given her in tenth grade. Mia had long ago lost the one Lexi had made for her, but Lexi had never taken this one off before. She untied it slowly and dropped it in the Thermos. Her memento made no sound when it landed; it bothered her, as if she were the only one of three of them that left no mark somehow.</p><p>Zach screwed the lid back on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should ever dig it up,\u201d Mia said. Behind her, a gust of wind came up from the waves and ruffled her hair. \u201cDigging it up would mean ... like good-bye, and we don\u2019t want that. As long as it\u2019s here, it means we still love each other.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wanted to say just the right thing. The moment seemed magical, charged; she\u2019d always remember it. \u201cNo good-byes,\u201d she said, meaning it.</p><p>The look that moved between them was heavy with emotion: in their eyes, they passed around the sad truth that they would be separating soon and that they loved one another, as well as the sweet truth, or hope, that in this coming future some things would survive, that three teenagers could stand in the moonlight and promise to be friends forever and keep that promise.</p><p>They knelt in the sand, far above the high-tide line, and at the base of the old tree, they dug deep, deep into the cold gray sand and buried their Ninja Turtles Thermos time capsule.</p><p>Lexi wanted to keep it going, to keep promising to search for a future that felt slippery, but when the capsule was buried, the sand looked undisturbed again, and the moment washed away.</p><p>Nine</p><p>In early June, the garden was miraculous. This was the time of year that Jude\u2014finally\u2014could take a moment to sit back and enjoy the hard work she\u2019d done. Everywhere she looked, she saw the rewards of her careful planning and judicious pruning. The beds were a riot of glorious color, with sugary pink saucer-sized roses, ruffled yellow peonies, spiked purple delphinium. The deep green English boxwood she\u2019d taken such time with was well on its way to becoming the bones of the garden. Above it all, a lotus tree was in full golden bloom; it looked like a Monet painting, just slightly out of focus, against the vibrant blue sky.</p><p>She could see how it was all coming together, growing in. Soon, maybe even next year, she would be ready to reveal her pride and joy to the garden-tour attendees.</p><p>She peeled off her dirty gloves and got to her feet. The heady scent of roses captured her, made her stand there a moment longer than she\u2019d intended. There was such peace for her here. Every plant, every flower, every shrub was placed according to her plan. If she didn\u2019t like the way something grew or spread or bloomed, she yanked it out and replaced it. She was the Red Queen of this realm, in complete control, and, as such, she was never disappointed.</p><p>But there was more to her current sense of well-being than that. She hadn\u2019t realized until the twins got accepted to USC how tense she\u2019d been throughout senior year, how stressed out. She\u2019d worried endlessly about the kids and for them. She\u2019d worried that one or the other would miss a deadline or make an irreparable mistake or that they wouldn\u2019t have the chance to go to college together. Now, she could sleep again, and, amazingly, she was excited for them to leave home. Oh, she was still anxious about them, still concerned about the emptiness of her nest, but spring had lightened more than a gloomy sky; it had lightened her way. She could glimpse a new future for herself, a time when she could be the captain of her own journey. If she wanted to go back to school for landscape architecture, she could; if she wanted to open a garden accessories store, she could. And if she wanted to simply sit on a lawn chair for the whole summer, reading the classics she\u2019d missed, she could do that, too. Hell, she could spend a summer reading comic books if she wanted to.</p><p>The thought was liberating and a little scary.</p><p>She glanced down at her watch. It was nearing three o\u2019clock, which meant that the kids would be home from school any minute. If the pattern from the past month held, they\u2019d come home in a swarm of seniors, all of whom seemed to be on a mild form of crack. That was what pseudo adulthood and impending graduation had done to the kids. They\u2019d become amped up, superemotional versions of themselves. The boys laughed too hard sometimes; girls became maudlin at the drop of a hat, burst into tears over a bad hair day.</p><p>It was no wonder that emotion ran so high in these first golden days of summer. In the words of the great Sam Cooke, change gonna come, and everyone knew it, felt its hot breath drawing near. Most of the island kids had been together since grade school, and their friendships ran deep. They were torn now, wanting both to stay here, where life was safe and known, and to fly far, far away, testing the wings they\u2019d just recently grown. Each passing day, each hour, brought the end of high school that much closer. They felt the need to make lasting memories together. That was what mattered most to them, getting together. It was the same thing that scared the parents. Parties were rampant.</p><p>To combat the whole party obsession, Jude had taken her cue from the plain old garden spider: she created an attractive web. She\u2019d had Miles haul out the Jet Skis and the ski boat and ready them for use. She made endless trays of food for ravenous boys and set out bowls of chocolate-covered dried cherries for the girls. She made it easy for her kids\u2019 friends to spend the day and night here, under her watchful eyes. For the most part, it had worked. Also, she had learned to trust her kids. Sure, they snuck a few beers at parties, but they kept their word: someone always stayed sober to drive, and they had never missed a curfew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She put her gardening supplies away\u2014everything in its place\u2014and paused in her greenhouse. There was the petunia Lexi had given her the night of the dance; it looked leggy and forlorn. She made a mental note to plant it, and then went back into the house. There, she showered and dressed in a pair of low-rise black pants and a fitted white T-shirt. She placed the movies she\u2019d rented on the kitchen counter: Along Came Polly, Starship Troopers 2, and Return of the King.</p><p>She was just about to go to the garage for a Coke when the front door banged open.</p><p>Footsteps thundered across the wood floors of the great room and thudded up the stairs.</p><p>What the hell?</p> <p>Jude put down her dishrag and walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>The front door stood wide open.</p><p>Jude closed the door and then went up the stairs. Zach\u2019s door was open; Mia\u2019s was closed.</p><p>She paused outside her daughter\u2019s room, heard the unmistakable sound of crying. Sobbing.</p><p>\u201cMia?\u201d she said. At the silence that followed, she opened the door.</p> <p>Her daughter lay sprawled facedown on her bed, crying into the stuffed pink puppy that had been her favorite childhood toy.</p><p>Jude went to the bed. \u201cHey, Poppet,\u201d she said quietly, using the nickname that had been lost along the way, tucked in somewhere alongside baby teeth and patent leather shoes.</p><p>Mia made a howling sound and cried harder.</p><p>Jude stroked her daughter\u2019s silky blond hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d she said, over and over.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like forever, Mia rolled over and looked up at Jude through puffy, bloodshot eyes. Her face was damp with tears, and her mouth trembled unevenly. \u201cH-he ... b-broke ... up with m-me,\u201d she said, bursting sobs.</p><p>Jude climbed up into the big bed beside Mia, who curled up against Jude\u2019s side like one of the potato bugs they used to hunt for.</p> <p>Her bright, beautiful, almost grown daughter looked like a little kid again, curled up, crying, holding Daisy Doggy as if it were a talisman, and maybe it was. The mementos of one\u2019s past had serious magic.</p><p>Mia looked up, tears streaking down her face. \u201cIn class,\u201d she added, as if it somehow doubled his crime.</p><p>Jude remembered this pain. Every woman had felt some version of it: the end of first love. It was when you learned, for good and always, that love could be impermanent. \u201cI know how much it hurts,\u201d Jude said. \u201cKeith broke up with me the week before senior prom. The week before. He took Karen Abner, and I sat home and watched Saturday Night Live by myself. I cried so much I\u2019m surprised the house didn\u2019t float away.\u201d She remembered that night with clarity. Her mother had come home late, taken one look at Jude and said, Oh, for God\u2019s sake, Judith Anne, you\u2019re a child, and kept walking. Jude looked down at her daughter\u2019s teary face. \u201cA broken heart hurts.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd it heals.\u201d</p><p>Mia sniffled loudly. \u201cNo one else is gonna want me. I\u2019m such a dweeb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mia. You haven\u2019t even begun to find out who you really are, and, believe me, other boys are going to fall in love with you. If a guy can\u2019t see how special you are, he isn\u2019t good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just hurts so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t always, though. You won\u2019t always want to puke when you see him with another girl. And then one day you\u2019ll see another guy who makes your heart race and it\u2019ll ... just fade. Your heart will stitch itself back up and only a tiny scar will remain behind, and someday you\u2019ll tell your daughter how Tyler Marshall hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never want to see him again. How can I go to the grad party if he\u2019s there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any good to hide out in life, Mia. That\u2019s how you used to handle things. You\u2019re stronger now.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cI know. Lexi says I shouldn\u2019t care what anyone thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mia said, but she sounded unconvinced.</p><p>Jude held her daughter, remembering the whole of their lives in the blink of an eye. \u201cI love you, Poppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, Madre. Can we go get Lexi now? I need her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That\u2019s what best friends are for.\u201d</p><p>In less than ten days, they would be graduating from high school.</p><p>Lexi stood in a crowd of seniors, staring out at the sea of folding chairs that had been set up in the gymnasium.</p><p>Principal Yates stood beneath the basketball hoop, his arms extended, telling them how the ceremony would go, but only a handful of kids were paying attention. The rest of them were laughing and talking and jostling one another.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll file alphabetically out of the gym and along the bleachers and onto the football field\u2014if it\u2019s sunny. If not, we\u2019ll be in here,\u201d the principal was saying. \u201cNow, let\u2019s try a walk-through, okay? Jason Adnar, you start us off...\u201d</p><p>Lexi followed along as she was supposed to, finding her seat on the floor. The rehearsal took all of sixth period, and when it was over, they were released from school. The whole class burst out of the gym like some musical where the kids were starting summer break.</p><p>She and Zach found each other without really trying; it was like echolocation. Each just knew where the other was, and they couldn\u2019t stand to be apart. Everything felt so big these days, so momentous. Graduation. Summer vacation. College. Sometimes all Lexi could really hold onto was now, her love for Zach and her friendship with Mia. Everything else was changing.</p><p>Zach took her by the hand, and they walked across campus. At the student parking lot, he opened the Mustang door for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mia?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>\u201cMom is picking her up. They\u2019re having girl time after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be good for Mia.\u201d Lexi got in the car.</p><p>Zach slid into the driver\u2019s seat and looked at her. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tensed. Reaching over, she held on to his hand as if it were a lifeline, which it had been from the beginning. All the way through town and down to LaRiviere Park, she said nothing.</p><p>At the park, he pulled into their usual spot and turned off the engine. She waited for him to open his door, but instead he twisted around in his seat. His green eyes were bright with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>He was going to break up with her. She should have expected this, been ready for it. She wanted to say, I know you do, but she couldn\u2019t do it. The words felt like broken glass in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want go to Seattle Central with you. We could get an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What? You want to go to community college with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you, Lex.\u201d</p><p>She actually shuddered with relief, made a little sound.</p><p>He kissed her damp cheek and wiped his eyes, looking embarrassed by tears that were more valuable to her than diamonds.</p><p>Holding hands, they left the car and walked out to their place among the driftwood and sat down together. Waves whooshed along the sand, sounding like first love to Lexi. When she looked at him, she almost started to cry again.</p><p>He began to spin the dream for her. He talked about their life and the apartment they would find and the jobs they would get. He meant it, all of it, and she loved him all the more for it, but wanting it wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d was all she had to say. She hated to remind him, but what kind of friend would she be if she didn\u2019t? She loved Mia as much as she loved Zach.</p><p>Zach sighed. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d He stared past her, out at the Sound. Then he said it again, more softly, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should even talk about this, Zach. What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it could work. Why couldn\u2019t it? We could get an apartment in Seattle. The three of us. We could go to Seattle Central Community College for a year or two and then transfer to the U. I\u2019ll still get in a good med school. It\u2019s not like USC is the only good school in the world.\u201d</p><p>She felt like a kid hanging onto a balloon, being pulled effortlessly into the air. His vision was so buoyant; for a few precious moments, she let herself believe in all of it. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them what I want,\u201d and she lost her hold on the string and fell back to earth.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, burrowing as tightly against him as she could. Instead of saying anything, she strained upward, kissing him until the tears in her eyes dried up. She let her hands and her mouth communicate how much she loved him.</p><p>Afterward, they lay entwined, listening to the incoming tide, watching the cerulean blue sky begin ever so slightly to darken. Finally, as the day drifted toward a lavender evening, they had to leave their snow-globe world, where the view was always the same and no one else could get in.</p><p>Lexi held his hand all the way back to his house, afraid to let go. As they turned onto Night Road, her tension grew, until it was a pitchfork-jabs headache that wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>She loved Zach, but he didn\u2019t know anything about disappointment. Everything had always come so easily. He didn\u2019t expect anything else.</p><p>She saw it in his face, a steely determination that fit uncomfortably on his handsome features, like a boy stepping into his dad\u2019s oversized shoes and pretending they fit. \u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d he asked, coming around to her side of the car.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a confident smile. \u201cIt\u2019ll be cool. You\u2019ll see. Come on.\u201d</p><p>She let him take her hand and lead her into the house.</p><p>Miles and Jude lay engtangled on the sofa, each reading a book. Mia lay stretched out on the sectional\u2019s other end, watching TV. In a pink terrycloth hoodie, baggy gray sweats, and rhinestoned flip-flops, she looked like a little girl playing dress up. It wasn\u2019t until you saw her bloodshot eyes that you knew how wounded she still was, how fragile.</p><p>Mia got to her feet. \u201cHey guys,\u201d she said, smiling a little too brightly.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s heart ached for her best friend; she saw how hard Mia was trying to be strong. She went to her, hugged her fiercely. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Mia said. \u201cOr I will be. You guys should stop worrying about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom? Dad?\u201d Zach said, coming forward. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Jude looked up sharply. Lexi was reminded of one of those nature shows where the prey animal steps on a twig and the predator suddenly looks up. That was how Jude looked now\u2014on alert. \u201cYou want to talk to us? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d She got up quickly, moved toward her son.</p><p>Zach took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m not going to USC. I want all three of us to go to Seattle Central CC. Mia? We could get an apartment.\u201d</p><p>Jude froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Miles got to his feet. \u201cWe paid your tuition deposit. It\u2019s nonrefundable. Damn it, Zach\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked you to pay it,\u201d Zach yelled back.</p><p>\u201cYou never asked us not to,\u201d Miles said harshly. He stood beside Jude, who\u2019d gone pale. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you this, I\u2019m not paying for any damn apartment. If you want to throw opportunity away, you can do it on your tab. See how much fun college is when you have to work full-time and pay your own bills.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Zach said. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Jude hissed, holding up a hand. She looked shell-shocked, a little dazed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Talk to us, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d Mia said, frowning. \u201cYou won\u2019t go to school with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her,\u201d he said, looking miserable.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you can leave me? Me?\u201d Mia said, starting to cry.</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you to come with us. I said that,\u201d Zach answered. \u201cCome on, Mia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice do I have?\u201d Mia cried, looking from Zach to Lexi. \u201cI guess this is you being my friend, too, huh?\u201d Then she ran for the stairs.</p><p>Zach followed his sister from the room and up the stairs.</p><p>Lexi felt Jude\u2019s gaze on her, judging her, blaming her, and Lexi felt a rush of shame. This family had done so much for her, given her so much, and now she was to blame for this. It took all her courage to look up into Jude\u2019s disappointed face. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad at me,\u201d she whispered, wringing her hands. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Jude said. Her voice was shaky and her face was pale.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him to do this ... to want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of Mia instead of Zach. Instead of yourself. You know how talented she is, and how shy. How would it be if the three of you lived together\u2014really. How long before you and Zach started to ignore her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would never happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? It looks as if it just did.\u201d Jude paused; her face seemed to soften at that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I hate to tangle you up in all of this. But if they don\u2019t go to USC they\u2019ll regret it, and sooner or later they\u2019ll blame you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi hated the truth she heard in those words.</p><p>\u201cTalk to them,\u201d Jude said, clutching Miles\u2019s hand so tightly her fingers were white.</p><p>Lexi wanted to say no, at least to be uncertain about what to do, but she wasn\u2019t. Some courses of action were obvious. She had done the wrong thing once before, risked her friendship with Mia and her place in this family. Then, as now, love and longing had blinded her. It was a mistake she refused to repeat.</p><p>She turned her back on Miles and Jude and made her way across the room\u2014bigger suddenly, an endless sea crossing\u2014and went up the stairs. They were in Mia\u2019s room, standing like a pair of matched statues, staring at each other.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>They turned at the same time, wearing identical expressions.</p><p>\u201cI wish I were stronger,\u201d Mia said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than you think,\u201d Lexi said, moving into the room. Zach reached out for her but she sidestepped him. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d</p><p>Mia started to cry. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of USC for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could go by yourself,\u201d Zach said, and Lexi loved him for saying it, but she heard the crack in his voice, saw the regret already filling his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill to go to USC,\u201d Lexi said quietly. \u201cI\u2019d give anything.\u201d She swallowed, looked from one face to the next, struck by how alike they were, mirror images. \u201cYou guys can\u2019t give up everything just because I don\u2019t have it. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>She could see how hurt Zach was by her words, and how relieved. She drew in a shaky breath. Yes, he loved her. But he loved his sister, too, and he wanted to make his parents proud, and to secure his future. All of that, he could do at USC. Lexi forced a smile. \u201cEnough of this. You two are going to USC. I\u2019ll be rocking SCC. We\u2019ll see each other every vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a whole month at Christmas,\u201d Mia said. At another time she might have smiled, but now she looked as broken as Lexi felt. Was this adulthood, this pruning of dreams to be practical?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Mia said. Zach just stood there, looking pissed and relieved and a little desperate. Cornered.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t change anything,\u201d Lexi said, and they all knew it was a lie.</p><p>The decision had been made. There was nothing more to say.</p><p>Ten</p><p>For the next few days, Jude felt a little unsteady, adrift. A bullet had been dodged, there was no doubt about that. Lexi had somehow convinced Zach to follow through on the plans that had been made. It should have been a more than satisfactory conclusion, and it was, but like all compromises, something had been lost by everyone. There was a fissure in this house now, a resentment that was new. Jude couldn\u2019t remember when Zach had been so angry at her. Zach, her pliable, lovable boy, had become a surly, angry teenager who slouched in his chair and mumbled his sentences. He was pissed at his sister and his mother\u2014and maybe at Lexi, who knew?\u2014and he wanted everyone to know it.</p><p>Jude had tried to give him space. In the days since the blowup, she\u2019d walked carefully around him, treated him with exaggerated care, but the price to her was high. She simply couldn\u2019t stand being on the outs with her children. Last night, she\u2019d hardly slept at all for worrying about it. Instead she\u2019d lain in bed, staring up at the ceiling, envisioning one conversation after another. In her imaginings, she and Zach always ended up laughing about their differences ... and he rededicated himself to USC and his sister. Sometimes he even finished with, I know how young we are, Madre, don\u2019t worry so much, it\u2019s cool, thanks ...</p><p>Now, she stood at her bedroom window, staring out at her backyard as evening fell across the water.</p><p>Tonight was the last big high school party of the year\u2014the grad barbeque. Truth be told, she didn\u2019t want to let them go. There was so much unresolved between them, so many things to discuss, but she knew nothing would be solved tonight. And if she denied them this party, they\u2019d never speak to her again. But tomorrow. Tomorrow they were going to work through all this drama and get back on track. This was their last year together; she\u2019d be damned if they\u2019d spend it like strangers.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Mia said, knocking at her bedroom door and opening it wide. \u201cCan I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>That was fast becoming a dangerous sentence. Jude turned, forced a smile. \u201cOf course, honey.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked beautiful in the bright late-afternoon light. She was dressed for the party in a pair of ragged, cutoff jeans with carefully placed holes, a tight white T-shirt, and a vintage men\u2019s paisley vest that hung off her slim shoulders. Her hair had been drawn back from her face in a loose ponytail; several red metallic baby barrettes held the tiny wisps out of her eyes. \u201cYou look sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Mia came up beside Jude, put an arm around her waist, and leaned against her. Side by side, supported by each other, they stared out the window. \u201cHe loves her, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mia turned, tilted her face up. \u201cHe loves her.\u201d</p><p>Jude fell silent. For the first time, the words actually resonated. Love. All this time she\u2019d minimized it, trimmed its sails because of their age. She\u2019d told herself they were too young to understand their own lives. But it was true, their love; it might not last, but it was real.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m breaking them up, making him go to school with me, and you know what the worst part is? They\u2019ve stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>Jude touched her daughter\u2019s cheek, seeing the pain in Mia\u2019s eyes. This daughter of hers was so sensitive. \u201cOf course they have. They\u2019ll always be there for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to be there for them, too. That\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to USC, Mom. The three of us can go to community college and get an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you and Dad won\u2019t pay for it, we\u2019ll get jobs. It\u2019s the right thing to do, Madre. You always said nothing mattered more than love and family. Did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia, we\u2019ve paid deposits, made commitments. It\u2019s not this simple. You can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of footsteps in the hallway interrupted them. Zach came into the room. \u201cThere you are, Mia. It\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and I are talking,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Zach rolled his eyes. \u201cJust tell her you\u2019ll do what she wants. That\u2019s the A answer for team Farraday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Zach,\u201d Jude said. She felt unsettled, as if everything was unspooling around her, falling free, rolling away, and she couldn\u2019t find anything to hold onto.</p><p>\u201cFair?\u201d Zach said. \u201cIs that what matters now? You used to say you wanted us to be happy, but that\u2019s only true when we do what you want us to do.\u201d He looked at Mia. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We have to pick up Lexi, and I don\u2019t want to be late to the party.\u201d On that, he turned his back on them and strode out of the room.</p><p>\u201cGotta go, Madre.\u201d Mia gave Jude a last, sad smile, and followed her brother.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jude called out, hurrying after her daughter, following her to the front door. Outside, she could see the Mustang, hear its engine roar to life.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow,\u201d Jude said to Mia. \u201cThis decision about USC is not made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Mia gave her a bright smile. \u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I do not forgive you,\u201d Jude said. \u201cAnd sweet talking won\u2019t work this time. This isn\u2019t over. You have to think about your futures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom, but it kinda is. Love you,\u201d Mia gave Jude a kiss on the cheek and then ran out to the car.</p><p>\u201cI want you home by one o\u2019clock,\u201d Jude said, following her daughter. It was too small, not really what she wanted to say at all, but it was all she had now. Tomorrow they would have a serious talk, all three of them. \u201cAt one-o-two, I\u2019m calling the police or driving over.\u201d</p><p>At the car, Mia hugged her mother fiercely. \u201cWe\u2019ll be home,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cAnd no drinking,\u201d Jude said. She leaned down to see her son through the car window. \u201cZach, you\u2019re the designated driver. No matter what. That\u2019s our deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>She had to add: \u201cIf anything happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Zach said. \u201cWe\u2019ll call home for a ride. Come on, Mia. Lexi\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe home by one,\u201d Jude said again, stepping back, watching them drive off. \u201cI mean it,\u201d she said, but there was no one beside her to hear the words.</p><p>Driving too fast, music blaring through the car, Zach turned onto Night Road. Lexi slid into the car door at every hairpin turn.</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d Mia yelled from the backseat, but Zach just cranked up the music. \u201cYeah,\u201d by Usher was at the edge of pain.... got so caught up I forgot ...</p><p>When they got to the party, there were already more than a dozen cars parked in the clearing.</p><p>Zach pulled the key out of the ignition and dropped it in the well between the seats. \u201cI need something to drink,\u201d he said, getting out of the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lexi got out of the car and went to him. \u201cBut you\u2019re the d.d.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. And I know my limits. You\u2019re not my mom.\u201d He pulled away from her and strode toward the party.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Mia came up beside her. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt me?\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cAt you, me, my parents, himself. Everyone. He doesn\u2019t know what he wants and it\u2019s killing him. He\u2019s always been like that. When things come easily, Zach\u2019s cool. But when he\u2019s confused or hurting, he loses it. Sometimes he yells and sometimes he shuts up. This time he\u2019s yelling. He\u2019s especially mad at Mom and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys would be crazy to give up USC for a crappy apartment and classes at a community college. He\u2019ll see that,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>Mia took her by the hand, and they headed down the driveway. Deep in the woods, they found the small log cabin that was one of the island\u2019s original homesteads. A big bonfire danced in front of the beach. Beside it stood a pair of silver kegs. Over to the left, someone was grilling hot dogs.</p><p>Mia and Lexi stood at the perimeter of the party, talking. All around them kids were laughing and dancing and drinking. Out on the water, a pair of Jet Skis buzzed and raced. Music blared out from a boom box on the porch. The air smelled of pine trees and wood smoke and marijuana.</p> <p>As they stood there, Tyler walked past them. Alaina Smith was draped all over him, hanging on him. He had his hand on her ass.</p><p>Mia drew in a sharp breath. Wiping her eyes, she walked over to the keg and got herself a beer, downing it as fast as she could.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>\u201cJust stay with me,\u201d Mia said shakily. \u201cDon\u2019t let me be alone ... I might make a fool of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never let you be alone,\u201d Lexi promised. She got a beer, and even though she hated the taste, it softened her somehow, and Mia, too, and in no time they were smiling again and making jokes.</p><p>When she finished her second beer, Mia said, \u201cWe need Zach. I have a surprise for you two. Something to tell you. Meet me on the beach.\u201d She headed into the crowd before Lexi could stop her, and that was cool, because Lexi didn\u2019t want to stop her. As much as she loved being with her best friend, she wanted Zach here, too. This was their graduation party, the last one before the big day, and the three of them should be together.</p> <p>Lexi headed down to the beach and sat in the sand, waiting.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Zach said a few minutes later, sitting down beside her. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mia? She went looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Zach shrugged and handed her a bottle of rum. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re not supposed to be drinking,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cLast one, I promise. Here.\u201d</p><p>She hated to drink like this, without mixers or anything, but she didn\u2019t want to upset him, so she took a sip.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t give a shit about what I want,\u201d he said and lifted the bottle to his mouth again.</p> <p>Lexi didn\u2019t know if he was talking about his mother or his sister, but it didn\u2019t really matter either way. \u201cYes, she does.\u201d</p><p>He took another long drink, handed it to her. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t give a shit what she wants.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sighed. \u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his eyes wild. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly what he was feeling: it was the universe of her own emotions. She was afraid of watching him go; he was afraid of letting her stay. \u201cI know,\u201d was all she could say. She believed him now, believed in his love, and that was everything.</p><p>They needed to be strong for each other, and she would be the one to start. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop loving you, Zach.\u201d</p><p>In a taut voice, he said, \u201cCome here,\u201d and took her hand and led her deep into the woods.</p><p>There, they kissed and undressed and made love in a way that was new; sad, maybe, and a little rough, with their bodies communicating all the difficult words they couldn\u2019t say. When it was over and they lay there, spent, staring up at the starlit sky, Lexi reached for the rum bottle and drank until their future didn\u2019t seem so sharp and a nice fuzziness blurred the edges.</p><p>Finally, unsteady on their feet, they left the copse of trees and returned to the party, which was now completely out of control. There were more than one hundred kids there, talking, laughing, dancing. Boys were tossing a football back and forth; a bunch of people were gathered around the kegs; more stood around the huge bonfire. On the cabin, a sign read: Class of 2004\u2014Good Bye and Good Luck.</p><p>Mia shrieked when she saw them and stumbled toward them. \u201cWhere were you guys?\u201d she said, handing Lexi a half-empty bottle of rum. \u201cThis is our night. The three of us. Okay?\u201d</p><p>They stood there, a little drunk, staring at one another, an island in a sea of seniors. Mia reached out for Zach\u2019s hand, then for Lexi\u2019s, and, with that touch, the connection returned. They were them again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s party,\u201d Zach said, smiling at his sister.</p><p>Lexi could see the love between these two, and as much as it hurt to know that they would leave her, she was glad the fight was over. They needed this last summer together.</p><p>They merged into the party and became a part of it, laughing, drinking, dancing until the moon rose in a dark sky and the air turned cold. By two o\u2019clock in the morning, the party was winding down. Kids lay sprawled on the ground, on the grass, on the porch.</p><p>Mia started to say something and stopped. \u201cWha was I saying?\u201d</p><p>Zach laughed drunkenly. \u201cYou said you had a surprise for us. You\u2019ve been saying it all night. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, thass right,\u201d Mia said and fell sideways. Her head smacked on a rock and she moaned, \u201cShit. Tha hurt...\u201d</p><p>Lexi helped Mia sit back up. \u201cShe\u2019s bleeding, Zach.\u201d</p><p>They all burst into laughter at that.</p><p>Lexi tried to use her sleeve to wipe the blood off Mia\u2019s forehead, but her balance was off and she kept poking Mia in the eye instead, and Mia just laughed harder.</p><p>Mia lurched up suddenly and stood there, swaying. \u201cOh man...\u201d She clamped a hand over her mouth for a second and then stumbled sideways, falling to her knees in the sand and vomiting. The wretching sound and the smell made Lexi almost sick, too, but she went to Mia anyway, held her hair back.</p><p>\u201cI am so hammered,\u201d Mia finally said, wiping her mouth with her sleeve and sitting back on her heels.</p><p>Zach lurched toward them. He was so unsteady he tripped over a stone and fell down. \u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIss time to go,\u201d Mia said. \u201cMom\u2019ll kill us if we\u2019re late. Wha time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo ten,\u201d Lexi said, squinting at her watch. She thought that was right. The numbers were dancing and blurring.</p><p>\u201cOh SHIT.\u201d Zach staggered to his feet. \u201cWe gotta go.\u201d</p><p>They made their weaving, unsteady way up the bank and across the grassy lawn, stepping around the bodies of their passed-out classmates. Mia stepped on someone\u2019s arm and laughed, yelled, \u201cOops! Sorry.\u201d</p><p>As they staggered to the car, it hit Lexi: Zach was drunk. She turned to him.</p><p>He stood there, swaying like a palm tree in the trade winds, his eyes closed.</p><p>Then she looked at Mia, who was puking again. Blood was dripping down the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t drive,\u201d Lexi said to Zach.</p><p>Mia got closer to the car and bent forward like a rag doll, pressing her cheek against the hood. \u201cCall Mom,\u201d she said. She dug in her pocket for her phone, dropped it on the ground.</p><p>Lexi picked up the phone.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Zach said. \u201cLass time she practically grounded us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHesh right,\u201d Mia said. \u201cLess jus go.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tried to concentrate, but she couldn\u2019t. All she could really think about was that they should call Jude, but what would Jude think of Lexi then? What if Eva found out about this? Lexi had promised to be good, and here she was at a party again.</p><p>Mia shivered violently. \u201cI\u2019m freezing, Zach \u2019tack. Where\u2019s my coat? An my head hurts. Why does my head hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should sleep here,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cMom would kill us,\u201d Zach said, stumbling forward, slamming into his car. He wrenched the driver\u2019s door open and fell into the seat. The keys were in the well; he searched around, swearing, and then laughed, \u201cGot \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of there, Zach,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cYou\u2019re too drunk to drive.\u201d She walked around the driver\u2019s side of the car, trying not to stumble or fall. \u201cMia, help me,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cTell Zach he\u2019s too drunk to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIss only a mile...\u201d Mia said. \u201cAn Mom did flip out lass time we called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Zach said, smiling sloppily.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Mia moaned, wiping more blood from her forehead. She opened the car door and fell into the backseat. \u201cOuch,\u201d she said, laughing, and then curled up into a fetal position on the seat.</p><p>Zach slipped the key into the ignition and started the engine, which roared to life in the quiet darkness. \u201cCome on, Lex. Iss no big deal. Less go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lexi said, shaking her head. The movement pushed her off-balance and made her fall forward; she hit the side of the car. \u201cWait. I gotta think. This isn\u2019t a good idea...\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Beep.</p><p>Beep.</p><p>Beep.</p><p>Jude sat up, bleary-eyed.</p><p>She was on the sectional in the living room. Her cell phone lay on the cushion beside her, chirping. An infomercial flitted silently across the TV screen.</p><p>She struggled to focus on the small face of her watch. 3:37. Then she flipped open her cell phone. There was a text from Mia.</p><p>Sry wr late. On our way. Luv U. The text had come in at 2:11.</p><p>Oh, they would be sorry. They\u2019d come home late, not checked in with Jude, and forgotten to turn off the exterior lights. This would be their last party for a while. She got up, turned off the TV and the outside lights, and locked the front door. As she climbed the stairs, she tried to decide whether to wake them up or yell at them tomorrow.</p><p>She opened Mia\u2019s door and turned on the light. The bed was empty.</p><p>She felt a ping of fear, like a drop of acid on bare skin, and went to Zach\u2019s room.</p><p>It was empty, too.</p><p>Take a breath, Jude. They missed their curfew; that was all. They\u2019d started to leave the party and then been caught up somehow.</p><p>She called Mia\u2019s cell. It rang and rang, then went to voice mail.</p><p>It was the same with Zach\u2019s phone.</p><p>She ran downstairs to her room. Miles lay sleeping in bed, a book open on his chest, the television on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late, Miles, and they\u2019re not home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall them,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI did. No one answered.\u201d</p><p>Miles sat up, frowning, and glanced at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s almost four o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re never this late,\u201d she said.</p><p>Miles ran a hand through his hair. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to panic. They probably lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could drive over there,\u201d Jude said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Miles nodded. \u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Jude felt a rush of relief, then a burst of anger. \u201cThey are so grounded,\u201d she muttered, leaving the room.</p><p>She stepped out into the long, dark hallway. It was black ... and then red ... yellow. Lights cut through the darkness, blinking, blaring.</p> <p>Police lights.</p><p>She stumbled, almost fell. Then Miles was beside her, steadying her.</p><p>She felt herself moving forward but she wasn\u2019t really walking. She was a piece of flotsam caught up in her husband\u2019s motion.</p><p>Two policemen stood outside their door. It was raining, hard; why did she notice that? She knew these men, knew them and their wives and their children, but they shouldn\u2019t be here now, at her house, in the middle of the night, their images flashing red and yellow.</p><p>Officer Avery stepped forward, his hat in his hand.</p> <p>She saw everything in pieces, out of focus, as if she were looking through binoculars set for someone else\u2019s eyes; staccato bursts of color, a macabre night, rain that looked like bits of ash falling from the sky.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s been an accident.</p><p>Words. Sounds. Lips that moved and the sound of heavy breathing. Falling rain.</p><p>Mia ... Zach ... Alexa Baill ...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t process it, couldn\u2019t make sense of it. My babies ... you\u2019re talking about my children.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been airlifted to Harborview, all three of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re okay?\u201d she heard her husband ask, and it shocked her so badly she almost pulled away from him. How could he find a voice now? Ask anything?</p><p>Did the policeman answer? What had he said? Jude couldn\u2019t hear anything over the rain, or the beating of her heart. Was she crying? Is that why she couldn\u2019t see?</p><p>Miles looked at her, and in his eyes she saw how breakable they both were, how fragile. It had happened in an instant, this new frailty; in the time it took them to walk from their bedroom to the front door, they had been pared down, their bones weakened. She thought his touch would bruise her now, leave a mark.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get dressed,\u201d he said, taking her by the arm. \u201cWe need to go.\u201d</p><p>The drive to the hospital seemed to take forever. There were no ferries running at this hour, so they had to take the bridge to Kitsap County and drive around to Seattle.</p><p>In the car, they didn\u2019t speak. Silence felt manageable; words did not. It took concentration just to draw in each breath and exhale without crying.</p><p>She wished she were a religious woman. All that spirituality she\u2019d cultivated didn\u2019t help her now; she needed faith, an antidote to this escalating fear. When they parked, Jude turned to her husband. He looked drawn and gaunt and the look in his eyes was harrowing.</p><p>She wanted to comfort him, as she did so often when he came home from work still mired in loss. She wanted to tell him not to think of the worst, but she was too brittle to even offer an arm.</p> <p>Inside the bright white hospital, Jude straightened her shoulders and forged ahead, trying to manage her fear by controlling everything around her. But her questions went unanswered, her calls for help unheeded.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Miles finally said, taking her aside in the crowded hallway. \u201cJust let them do their jobs. All we can do is wait.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to do nothing, but she had no choice. So she stood there, overwhelmed by helplessness, trying not to cry. Waiting.</p><p>Finally, at just past six in the morning, they got an answer. It felt as if they\u2019d been here for decades, but in truth, it had been less than an hour.</p><p>\u201cMia is in surgery,\u201d the man in front of her said. He was a big black man with tattooed biceps and the kindest, molasses-colored eyes she\u2019d ever seen. His orange scrubs looked more like prison clothes than hospital wear. \u201cShe suffered some pretty severe internal injuries. That\u2019s all I know,\u201d he added when Miles began to question him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, though,\u201d Jude said. Everything felt scrambled in her head, sounds seemed to be muffled. Why could she hear her own heartbeat in all this noise?</p><p>\u201cThe surgeon will come out to talk to you when he\u2019s done, but it will be a while. They just went in,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Zach?\u201d Miles asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to see him,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cHe sustained some chemical burns to his face and eyes, so he\u2019s bandaged. Before you ask, Dr. Farraday, that\u2019s all I know. He also cracked a couple of ribs. The girl, Alexa, is in with a doctor right now, but I think her injuries are less severe. A broken arm, a forehead laceration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurns?\u201d Jude said. \u201cHow bad is it? Has he seen a specialist? There\u2019s that doctor from the UW\u2014what\u2019s his name, Miles?\u201d</p><p>Miles took her hand. \u201cLater, Jude,\u201d he said firmly, and she felt that helplessness rise up in her again.</p><p>They followed the nurse into a private room, where her son, the boy she\u2019d thought only last week was looking so much like a man, lay in a metal-railed bed all alone, surrounded by machines. The right side of his face was bruised and swollen, misshapen somehow. Bandages wrapped his head, mushrooming out above his ears. A rectangular gauze pad covered the lower part of his right cheek and jawline.</p><p>Miles squeezed her hand, and this time she clung to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding your hand, Zach,\u201d Jude said, trying not to cry as she stared down at her son\u2019s bruised, burned face and bandaged eyes. His other hand was bandaged up past his wrist. \u201cJust like I used to, remember? I used to hold your hand all the way into the classroom in kindergarten. You got cool in eighth grade\u2014after that, I could only hold your hand in the car, and only for a few minutes. I used to reach back into the backseat, remember? And you\u2019d hold my hand for a few minutes, just so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>For a moment she thought she\u2019d imagined his voice. \u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered, squeezing his hand.</p><p>Zach tried to sit up. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie still, son. You\u2019re in a hospital,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cI ... can\u2019t see ... What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a car crash,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cAm I blind?\u201d</p><p>Of course not, Jude wanted to say. It couldn\u2019t be true, not to her son who had been afraid of the dark. \u201cYour eyes are bandaged, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know the extent of your injuries yet,\u201d Miles said evenly. \u201cJust rest, Zach. The important thing is that you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mia?\u201d Zach asked quietly, still sitting up. He looked around, blind behind all that gauze. \u201cAnd Lex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s in surgery right now. We\u2019re waiting to hear,\u201d Jude answered. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine. This is a wonderful hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lexi?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse thought she was going to be fine. We\u2019ll know more soon,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cJust rest, baby,\u201d Jude said, using her voice to soothe him as she had so often when he was little. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>She sat by his bed, as she\u2019d done so many times in his life. A few moments later, Miles left again to check on Mia\u2019s status. Waiting for answers was terrible, but Jude had to bear it. What choice did she have? And she believed in the deepest part of her soul that Mia would be fine. She had to believe that.</p><p>Behind her, the door opened again. \u201cNo news yet,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>Jude looked down at Zach again, trying to think of what to say to him. Words felt heavy and unwieldy and she couldn\u2019t tame her fear enough to think, so she dug deep into the past, went back to the days when she\u2019d had two babies who tangled up together like puppies in her lap, and she told him his favorite story. She didn\u2019t remember it word for word, but she remembered enough to start. \u201cThe night Max wore his wolf suit to make mischief, his mother called him Wild Thing and sent him to bed without dinner...\u201d</p><p>As she remembered the words\u2014something about the gnashing of his terrible teeth\u2014she tried to distance herself from the memories they evoked. But how could she? The story reminded her of a boy who\u2019d cried when she turned the lights out in his room, a boy who\u2019d been terrified of monsters in the closet and under the bed. Only his sister\u2019s presence could really calm him. Jude had ignored all the good parenting manuals and let the twins climb into bed with her and Miles.</p><p>And now his eyes were wrapped; he was deep in the dark.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her eyes. \u201cWhat, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo see her. Tell her ... tell her I\u2019m fine, okay?\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand and let go. \u201cOf course.\u201d She stood up, shaky on her feet, and turned to Miles. \u201cYou\u2019ll hold his hand while I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She pretended not to notice that they couldn\u2019t look at each other anymore. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>She stayed a second longer, unable somehow to leave her son; then she left the room and went out into the brightly lit hallway. Pausing to get her bearings, she walked up to the busy nurses\u2019 station.</p><p>\u201cCan I get information on Alexa Baill?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you a relative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is in Room 613 west. That\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded and left the nurse\u2019s station.</p><p>At 613 west, she paused a moment, then opened the door.</p><p>The room held two beds. The one by the window was unoccupied. In the other lay Lexi. Although her bed was angled up, she was asleep. Her pretty, heart-shaped face was bruised, her left eye had a bandage above it, probably from a laceration, and her left arm was in a cast. Beside her, Eva Lange sat in a plastic chair. The woman looked older than Jude remembered, and smaller. She had her hands clasped tightly in her lap.</p><p>Jude had heard so many stories about this woman over the years, how she\u2019d picked up Lexi sight unseen and offered her a home. Eva had had hardly any money, and only a rented trailer and a secondhand car to her name, but she\u2019d welcomed Lexi in. \u201cHello, Eva,\u201d Jude said. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>Eva looked up. Her dark eyes swam with tears and the wrinkles on her cheeks were accordion-deep. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? Getting a doctor to talk to you is like finding a winning lotto ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Miles get you some information. It\u2019s hard, though. We\u2019re waiting to hear about ... Mia, too.\u201d Jude looked at Eva, and though they had almost nothing in common, they had this moment, this mother\u2019s worry strung between them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Eva said softly, her eyes moist. \u201cShe told me she was spending the night at your house. With Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That was the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t home at 3:30?\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Jude suddenly, sharply, that her children were responsible in this, that they\u2019d driven ... and that she had let them go. \u201cThey ignored their curfew.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jude moved closer to the bed, stared down at this girl her son loved. It all seemed so unimportant now, the fight they\u2019d had because of that love. The question of colleges. Jude would do things differently from now on. Honest, God. I\u2019ll be better. Just make Mia and Zach and Lexi okay. \u201cShe\u2019s like a part of our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how much she loves you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love her, too. Well. I better go back now,\u201d she said at last, stepping back. \u201cWe might get word on Mia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m praying for all of them,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>Jude nodded, wishing she knew how to pray.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cJude, honey, there\u2019s news.\u201d</p><p>Jude awoke with a start. She was slumped in a chair at Zach\u2019s bedside. Somehow she\u2019d managed to fall asleep. She blinked and rubbed her eyes. It made no sense that sunlight was streaming through the window. She could tell that her son was asleep by the even strains of his breathing.</p> <p>Miles helped her to her feet and led her out into the hallway, where a man in blue scrubs stood waiting for them.</p><p>She clung to Miles\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Adams,\u201d the surgeon said, pulling the multicolored cap off his head. He had a shock of gray white hair and a pleated, basset hound face. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s knees buckled. She held on to Miles\u2019s strong arm, but suddenly he was shaking, too.</p><p>\u201cInjuries too severe ... no seatbelt ... thrown from the car...\u201d The surgeon kept talking, but Jude couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>A hospital chaplain moved into her field of vision, dressed in black, a crow coming to pick at bones.</p> <p>She heard someone screaming, and the sound blocked out everything. She pushed at the chaplain.</p><p>It was her. She was the one screaming no, crying.</p><p>When people tried to hold her\u2014maybe Miles, maybe the chaplain, she didn\u2019t know who was reaching for her\u2014she pushed free and stumbled aside, crying out her daughter\u2019s name.</p><p>She heard Miles behind her, firing questions at the surgeon, getting answers, something about cerebral blood flow and pentobarbital. When she heard him say brain death she threw up and sank to her knees in her own vomit.</p><p>Then Miles was beside her, handling her with the kind of gentleness that he usually reserved for his elderly patients. He put an arm around her, hoisted her to her feet and steadied her; she kept collapsing inward.</p><p>There were people gathered around, staring at her. Take it back, she thought, looking around at them.</p><p>Please, God.</p><p>Please.</p> <p>She was making a scene, humiliating herself.</p><p>Miles took her into an empty room, where she collapsed onto a plastic chair, bowing forward. It isn\u2019t real. It can\u2019t be. \u201cI was just with her,\u201d she said to Miles, looking up at him through scalding tears.</p><p>He sank to his knees in front of her and said nothing. She felt her insides draining away, emptying. Then there was a knock at the door.</p><p>How long had they been in here? A minute? An hour?</p><p>The chaplain stepped into the room. Beside him, a woman in a cheap blue suit held a clipboard.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see Mia?\u201d the chaplain said.</p><p>Jude looked in his blue eyes and saw tears; this stranger was crying for her, and the cold truth settled deep, deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Miles said, and it was the first time she even thought of him, of his pain. When she looked at him, she saw that he was crying, too.</p><p>They were so fragile. Who had known that? Not her, surely. Until just now, as she reached for her husband\u2019s hand, she\u2019d thought she was a strong woman. Powerful, even. Lucky.</p><p>They stood up together and walked down one corridor and then another until they came to the last door on their right. Far from other patients. Of course.</p><p>Miles had the strength to open the door, although how, Jude would never know.</p><p>The room was brightly lit, which surprised Jude; almost everything in it was stainless steel. And there was noise in here, machines whooshing, thunking. A computer screen showed a heartbeat spiking and falling across a field of black.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jude whispered. She\u2019d been wrong. In the roar of I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019d misunderstood. Mia wasn\u2019t gone. She was right here, looking as beautiful as always, her chest rising and falling. \u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Clipboard woman stepped forward. \u201cActually, she\u2019s not. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s called brain death, and I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Miles said, so harshly the poor woman went pale. \u201cI know why you\u2019re here and how long we have. I\u2019ve spoken with Dr. Adams. We\u2019ll consent. Just leave us alone.\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded.</p><p>\u201cConsent to what?\u201d Jude looked at Miles. \u201cShe looks perfect. A little bruised, but ... look how she\u2019s breathing. And her color is good.\u201d</p><p>Miles\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s the machines,\u201d he said gently. \u201cHer body is being kept alive, but her mind ... our Mia ... isn\u2019t in there anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Jude. You know how much I\u2019d fight for her if ... our girl were still here to fight for.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to believe him. Everything inside of her was screaming that this wasn\u2019t fair, that it wasn\u2019t right, that a mistake had been made. She started to pull back, shaking her head, but Miles wouldn\u2019t let her go. He pulled her hard against his chest, held her so tightly she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he whispered into her ear.</p><p>She screamed out loud, struggling in his arms, saying no no no, and still he held her against him. She cried until her whole body felt limp and empty, and finally he let her go.</p><p>She moved woodenly to her daughter\u2019s bedside.</p><p>Mia was surrounded by machines and wires and needles and IVs. She looked healthy enough to wake up any second and say Hola, Madre.</p><p>\u201cHey, Poppet,\u201d Jude said, hating the way her brittle voice cracked on the familiar nickname. \u201cShe needs her Daisy Doggy. Why didn\u2019t we bring him?\u201d</p><p>Miles came up beside her. \u201cHey, baby girl,\u201d he said, and he broke.</p><p>Jude wanted to comfort him, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I said to her was that I didn\u2019t forgive her. Oh my God, Miles\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>If Miles hadn\u2019t been beside her, holding her up, she would have collapsed beside this girl who seemed to be sleeping so peacefully. Jude remembered how it had felt to carry her, to imagine and love her before she\u2019d ever even seen her, how she used to talk to them, her unborn twins, swimming in her swollen belly like a pair of tiny fish, coiled together, always together ...</p><p>Zach would be alone now. An only child.</p><p>How would they tell him this?</p><p>The world felt Bubble Wrapped and far away. Jude didn\u2019t focus on anything except her daughter. In the next hour, calls were made to friends and family. Miles did all the talking. Words came at Jude, words that had had no meaning before. Organs. Heart. Corneas. Skin. Save people\u2019s lives. She nodded and signed and looked at no one and said nothing. People pushed at her, jostled her as they ran tests on Mia. More than once Jude snapped at someone and told them to be careful with her daughter. It was all she could do now. She reminded them that Mia was ticklish, that she sang off-key and hummed all the time, that she hated to be cold.</p><p>No one seemed to listen. They looked impossibly sad and lowered their voices to whispers. At some point the chaplain sidled up to her, pulled her away from the bed, and tried to comfort her with rote words. She elbowed him hard and rushed back to Mia. \u201cI\u2019m here, Poppet,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>She stood there as long as they let her, perfectly still, whispering words of love and telling stories and trying to remember every single thing about Mia.</p><p>Finally\u2014and she had no idea when it was, or how long she\u2019d been there\u2014Miles came up to her.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d he said, and she had the idea that he\u2019d said it more than once, maybe even yelled it.</p><p>She tore her gaze away from Mia and turned to her husband.</p><p>Behind Mia stood a team of people in surgical scrubs. She caught sight of someone holding a red and white cooler.</p><p>\u201cThey have to take her now, Jude,\u201d he said, peeling her fingers from the bed rail.</p><p>She stared at him through hot tears. \u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing. What was there to say? Who could ever be ready for a thing like this?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going with her?\u201d she said, pressing a hand over his heart, feeling it beat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the viewing area.\u201d His voice broke. \u201cShe won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to sit outside the OR,\u201d she said, even though she really wanted to run away.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She turned again, leaned down and kissed her daughter\u2019s plump pink lips. \u201cI love you, Poppet.\u201d She pulled the blanket up to Mia\u2019s neck. It was an instinctive gesture, a mother\u2019s caress. Finally, she drew back, shaking, and let Miles pull her away from the bed. In a moment, Mia would be really gone ...</p><p>They were wheeling her daughter out of the room when Jude remembered what they\u2019d forgotten. How had they forgotten?</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Miles looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d was all she could say.</p><p>Lexi can hear Mia talking, laughing ... saying something about part of your world ...</p><p>She mumbled, \u201cHuh?\u201d to her best friend and reached over for Mia, but there was no one beside her. Lexi woke slowly, blinking. Something was wrong. Where was she?</p><p>She tried to sit up and felt a sharp pain in her chest. It hurt so badly she cried out.</p><p>\u201cAlexa?\u201d Eva got up. She\u2019d been in a chair by the window, reading.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Lexi asked, frowning.</p><p>Eva moved closer. \u201cThe hospital.\u201d</p><p>The two words stopped time. Lexi remembered everything in a rush of images: the car\u2019s white hood hurtling forward; the tree, burned white by the headlights; Mia\u2019s screaming; smoke; the sound of shattering glass ...</p><p>\u201cWe crashed,\u201d she whispered, turning to look at her aunt. One look in Eva\u2019s sorrow-filled eyes and she knew it was bad. Lexi threw back the covers and started to get out of bed.</p><p>Eva grabbed her good wrist and held firm. \u201cDon\u2019t, Lexi. You\u2019ve got a broken rib and a fractured arm. Just be still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see Zach and Mia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sagged with relief. \u201cThank God. When did she leave? And how\u2019s Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia died, Lexi. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Died.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t seem to comprehend the words. How could it be? She felt Mia beside her, leaning close, whispering, don\u2019t let me be alone. I might do something stupid. It had been a moment ago, a second. Can I sit with you? \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t say that...\u201d</p><p>Eva shook her head, and there it was, wrapped in the silence like some sleeping snake that had just been poked. The truth lashed out.</p><p>The car. The crash. Dead.</p><p>No. No. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be true,\u201d Lexi whispered.

She glanced over at the door and expected to see Mia there, dressed in some weird getup, her arms crossed, her hair braided unevenly, smiling that smile of hers and saying, hola amiga, what should we do?</p><p>Then she sat up. \u201cZach?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Eva said. \u201cHe was burned. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>Burned.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any fire.\u201d</p><p>Burned.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Eva asked gently, holding Lexi\u2019s hand.</p> <p>Lexi lay back, feeling as if her soul had been scooped out of her body with a ragged blade. If she could have willed herself into nonexistence, she would have. Please God, let him be okay. How could she live otherwise?</p><p>How could she live without Mia?</p><p>Jude stood beside the gurney, holding Mia\u2019s hand. She knew there was commotion going on all around her: people coming and going, the team members talking about \u201cthe harvest\u201d as if Jude were deaf. There was a boy that desperately needed Mia\u2019s strong, loving heart, only a year younger than her daughter, and another boy who dreamed of playing baseball ... a mother of four who was dying of kidney failure and just wanted to be strong enough to walk to school with her children. The stories were heartbreaking and should have comforted Jude. She\u2019d always cared about things like that. But not now.</p><p>Let Miles find peace in these donations. She did not. Neither did they upset or offend her. She just didn\u2019t care.</p><p>There was nothing inside of her but pain; she kept it trapped inside, behind pursed lips. God help her if she started screaming.</p><p>At her back, she heard a door open and she knew who it was. Miles had brought Zach to say good-bye to his twin sister. The door closed quietly behind them.</p> <p>It was the four of them now, just the family. All those doctors and specialists were outside, waiting.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Mia,\u201d Zach said. \u201cI can\u2019t feel her.\u201d</p><p>Miles went pale at that. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cMia ... didn\u2019t survive, Zach,\u201d Miles said at last.</p><p>Jude knew she should go to her son, be there for him, but she couldn\u2019t make herself let go of Mia\u2019s hand, couldn\u2019t move. If she let go, Mia would be gone, and the idea of that loss was overwhelming, so she held it away.</p><p>\u201cShe d-died?\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cThey did everything they could. Her injuries were too extensive.\u201d</p><p>Zach started ripping the bandages off his eyes. \u201cI need to see her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Miles pulled their son into an embrace. \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he said, and by the end of his breath, they were both crying. \u201cShe\u2019s right here. We knew you\u2019d want to say good-bye.\u201d He led their burned, bandaged son to the gurney, where his sister lay strapped down, her body covered in white and kept alive by wheeled machines.</p> <p>Zach felt for his sister\u2019s hand and held it. As always, they came together like puzzle pieces. He bowed forward, let his bandaged head rest on his sister\u2019s chest. He whispered the nickname from their babyhood, \u201cMe-my...,\u201d and said something Jude didn\u2019t understand; probably it was a word from long ago, forgotten until now, a word from the twin language that was theirs alone. It had always been Zach chattering back then, talking for his sister ... and it was that way again.</p><p>Behind them, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>Miles took his son by the shoulders, eased him back from the gurney. \u201cThey have to take her now, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put her in the dark,\u201d Zach said in a hoarse voice. \u201cI\u2019m not really the one who was afraid. It was her.\u201d His voice cracked. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>At that little reminder of who they were, who they\u2019d been\u2014the twins\u2014Jude felt the last tiny bit of courage crumble away.</p><p>Don\u2019t put her in the dark.</p><p>Jude squeezed Mia\u2019s hand tightly, clinging to her daughter for as long as she possibly could.</p><p>Miles and Zach came up around her, reached out. They held one another upright, the three of them, the family that was left.</p><p>The knock at the door came again.</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d Miles said, his face wet with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s time. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Jude knew what she had to do, what they all were waiting for. She\u2019d rather cut out her own heart. But she had no choice.</p><p>She let go of her daughter\u2019s hand and stepped back.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Jude crouched in the hallway near the OR door. At some point, she\u2019d lost her footing and fallen to the cold linoleum floor, and she stayed there, her face pressed to the wall. She could hear people coming and going around her, rushing from one trauma to the next. Sometimes they stopped and talked to her. She looked up into their faces\u2014frowning and compassionate and a little distracted\u2014and she tried to understand whatever it was they were saying, but she couldn\u2019t. She just couldn\u2019t. Her whole body shook with cold and her vision was cloudy and she couldn\u2019t hear anything except the reluctant beating of her heart.</p><p>No. I do not forgive you.</p><p>We\u2019ll talk tomorrow.</p><p>These were the words that ran in an endless loop through her mind.</p><p>\u201cJudith?\u201d</p><p>She turned slightly, saw her mother standing there, tall and straight, her white hair perfectly styled, her clothes ironed. She knew her mother had been here for hours; she\u2019d tried repeatedly to speak to Jude, but what good were words now between strangers?</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, Judith,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit here in the hallway. Let me get you some coffee. Food will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood will not help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to yell, Judith.\u201d Mother glanced up and down the hallway, to see who might have heard the outburst. \u201cCome with me.\u201d She reached down.</p><p>Jude wrenched sideways, scurrying tighter into the corner. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mother. Just let me be, okay? Find Miles. Or go see Zach. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly are not fine. I think you should eat something. You\u2019ve been here seven hours.\u201d</p><p>Already Jude was sick of people saying this to her. As if food in her stomach would remedy the hole in her heart. \u201cGo away, Mother. I appreciate you coming here, okay? But I need to be alone. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I?\u201d Her mother made a quiet sound, and then said, \u201cFine.\u201d She lowered herself to her knees beside Jude.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Her mother collapsed the last inch to the cold linoleum floor. \u201cI\u2019m sitting with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jude felt a stirring of guilt\u2014no doubt this was one of her mother\u2019s self-interested gestures, a way to force Jude into bending to her will. At any other time, it would have worked, Jude would have sighed in defeat and gotten to her feet, doing as her mother asked. Now, she didn\u2019t care. She wasn\u2019t going to leave this spot until Miles came to get her. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t sit here, Mother. It\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked at her, and for a split second, there was an unbearable sadness in her gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve been cold before, Judith Anne. I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>Jude shrugged. It was all too much for her. She couldn\u2019t think about anything right now, and certainly not her mother. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she said tiredly, and the minute the word was out of her mouth, she regretted it. How could one word bring back an era, a child, in such exquisite detail? She saw Mia at thirteen, braces and acne and insecurity, saying \u201cwhatever\u201d in answer to every question ...</p><p>She closed her eyes and remembered ...</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, confused by the sound of her own name. How long had she been here? She glanced sideways; her mother was asleep beside her.</p><p>Miles stood outside the OR.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he said, reaching down for her.</p><p>Jude started to get up and fell back down. He was beside her in an instant, steadying her. When Jude was standing on her own, he helped Caroline to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Caroline said stiffly, smoothing her hair back from her face, although no strands had fallen free. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the waiting room,\u201d she said. Glancing at Jude for a moment, she almost said something more; then she turned and walked away.</p><p>Jude clung to her husband\u2019s arm and let him lead her into the operating room, where Mia lay on the table, draped in white. Her silvery-blond hair was covered in a pale blue cap. Jude took it off, let her daughter\u2019s hair fall free. She stroked it as she\u2019d done so many times before.</p><p>Mia still looked beautiful, but her cheeks were pale as chalk, her lips were colorless.</p><p>Jude held Mia\u2019s hand and Miles held Jude\u2019s. The three of them stayed connected, no one saying much of anything, just crying, until a nurse finally came in.</p><p>\u201cDr. Farraday? Mrs. Farraday? I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but we need to take your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Jude tightened her hold on Mia\u2019s cold hand. \u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>Miles turned to her and tucked her hair behind one ear. \u201cWe have to be with Zach now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be gone when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone now, Jude.\u201d</p><p>Jude started to feel pain and pushed it away, letting numbness return. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to feel anything. She leaned down and kissed Mia\u2019s cheek, noticing how cold it, too, was, and whispering, \u201cI love you, Poppet.\u201d Then she drew back and watched Miles do the same thing. She didn\u2019t know what he said; all she could hear was her own blood, rushing into and out of her heart. At first she was dizzy, but as she walked down the busy hallway and stepped into the elevator and rode down to the sixth floor, she lost even that slim sensation.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Farraday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>From somewhere in the fog, she heard Miles say her name. The impatient tone told her that he\u2019d said it more than once.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dr. Lyman,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>They were in another hallway, outside Zach\u2019s room. Jude didn\u2019t even remember getting here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d Dr. Lyman said.</p><p>She nodded and said nothing.</p><p>Dr. Lyman led them into her son\u2019s room. Zach sat slumped in bed, his arms crossed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s us, Zach,\u201d Jude said, trying to sound strong for her son.</p><p>Dr. Lyman cleared his throat and moved to Zach\u2019s bedside. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Zach shrugged, as if it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cMy face hurts like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a burn,\u201d Dr. Lyman said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m burned?\u201d Zach said quietly. \u201cOn my face? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare,\u201d Dr. Lyman said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t even know it\u2019s possible, but car airbags have something like jet fuel in them, a propellant. Normally they deploy just fine, but sometimes, and this is what happened to you, Zachary, it can go wrong and cause chemical burns. That\u2019s what happened to your eyes, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do I look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe burns aren\u2019t bad,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cThere\u2019s a small patch along your jaw that we\u2019re going to watch carefully, but there should be little or no real scarring. We don\u2019t anticipate needing any skin grafts. May I remove the bandages now?\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded.</p><p>Dr. Lyman went over to the sink and washed his hands and then carefully unwound Zach\u2019s bandages. Zach\u2019s hair had been shaved on one side and left long on the other, and it gave him a lopsided, off-balance look.</p> <p>As the bandages came off, Jude saw the whole blistered, oozing burn, the way it swept down along his hairline, across his cheek and jaw.</p><p>Slowly, Dr. Lyman removed the bandages on Zach\u2019s eyes, and the metal, honeycombed cups over each eye. He tilted Zach\u2019s head and put some drops in his eyes. \u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said, \u201copen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s lashes were crusty and spiked looking. He wet his lips and bit down on his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it, Zach,\u201d Miles said, leaning toward him.</p><p>Zach\u2019s eyelashes fluttered like a baby bird\u2019s first lifting of wings, and then slowly, slowly, he opened his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can you see?\u201d Dr. Lyman asked.</p><p>Zach took his time, turned his head. \u201cIt\u2019s blurry, but I can see. Mom. Dad. New guy with white hair.\u201d</p><p>Miles sagged forward. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Lyman said, \u201cThe blurriness is temporary. Your vision should clear up in no time. You\u2019re a lucky young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Lucky.\u201d</p><p>Jude could hear Zach crying, and it brought her fresh pain, both because it was happening and because she couldn\u2019t think of how to make him feel better. There was nothing she could do to help him or herself or Mia.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zach,\u201d Miles said when the doctor left them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, Dad,\u201d Zach said. \u201cHow am I supposed to live with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia wouldn\u2019t blame you,\u201d Miles said, and though his words were reasonable, his voice betrayed the depth of his pain. Jude could tell how hard her husband was trying to grieve for one child while comforting the other. She could tell because her struggle was the same.</p><p>\u201cI wish I were blind,\u201d Zach said, and for the first time, he sounded like a man. Certain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home and see Mia\u2019s room. Or her picture.\u201d</p><p>Just then, Officer Avery walked into the room. He was holding a crumpled-up paper bag in his hands, worrying the rolled crease with his blunt-tipped fingers. \u201cDr. Farraday? Jude?\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to bother you at this difficult time.\u201d He cleared his throat again. \u201cBut I need to ask Zach some questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Miles asked, stepping closer to the bed. \u201cZach? Can you answer a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>The officer cleared his throat and then stepped awkwardly toward Jude, offering her the paper bag. \u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She felt as if she were underwater, reaching for something that looked close but was really far away. She was faintly surprised when she felt the rough brown paper. Opening it, she saw a blur of quilted pink\u2014Mia\u2019s purse\u2014and she closed the bag quickly, clutching it in shaking hands.</p><p>The policeman stepped back a respectful distance, opened a small notebook. \u201cYou are Zachary Farraday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I am. You were Officer Friendly in fourth grade.\u201d</p><p>Officer Avery smiled briefly at that. \u201cAnd it was your white Mustang that was totaled on Night Road last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you attended a party at the Kastner house on Saturday night, with your sister and Alexa Baill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd about a hundred other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were drinking alcohol,\u201d the officer said, consulting a piece of paper. \u201cI have test reports here that show your blood alcohol level at point twenty-eight,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat\u2019s almost four times the legal limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zach said quietly.</p><p>I won\u2019t drink and drive, Madre ... you know you can trust me? How many times had Jude heard him make that promise?</p><p>She closed her eyes, as if darkness offered any refuge from this.</p><p>The officer flipped a page. \u201cDo you remember leaving the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was about two o\u2019clock. Mia was having a cow about us being late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you all decided to get in the car and drive,\u201d the officer said. The words were like a battering ram. Jude felt each one hit her spine and reverberate up.</p><p>\u201cLexi wanted to call home,\u201d Zach said quietly. \u201cI told her not to be stupid. We did that once and Mom flipped out. I didn\u2019t want to miss another party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Zach,\u201d Miles said, shaking his head.</p><p>Jude thought she might be sick again.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten all about that other time, when they\u2019d believed her words and called her for help. And what had she done\u2014made them pay for it by forcing them to skip several events that weekend.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>\u201cYou were fine until you came to Night Road,\u201d Officer Avery went on.</p><p>\u201cThere was no one on the road. Mia was ... Mia was in the backseat, singing along to the radio. That Kelly Clarkson song. I told her to shut up, and she hit me in the back of the head and then...\u201d Zach drew in a deep breath. \u201cWe weren\u2019t even going that fast, but it was dark and the turn just came up, you know? That hairpin just past the Smithsons\u2019 mailbox. Like out of nowhere. I heard Mia scream, and I yelled at Lexi to hit the brakes and tried to grab the wheel ... and then...\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cYou told Lexi to hit the brakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was driving,\u201d Zach said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to. I was supposed to. I was the designated driver. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Baill\u2019s blood alcohol level was point zero nine. The legal limit is point zero eight. Of course, she\u2019s under twenty-one, so she can\u2019t legally drink at all,\u201d the officer said.</p><p>Lexi was driving, not Zach.</p><p>Zach hadn\u2019t killed his sister.</p><p>Lexi had.</p><p>\u201cI need to see Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lexi,\u201d her aunt said, her face slackening with sorrow. \u201cSurely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see him, Aunt Eva.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt started to say no, but Lexi wouldn\u2019t listen. Before she knew it, she was crying and pushing past her aunt, limping down the hall.</p><p>She saw him through the open door at the end of the hallway.</p><p>He was alone in his room.</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d she said at the doorway, moving toward him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he said, barely moving his lips.</p><p>Lexi felt those two words crash into her again. She stumbled. \u201cI know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to feel her, you know. She was always humming inside my head. Now ... now...\u201d He looked up. When he saw her, his eyes filled with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p><p>She limped over to the bed and took him in her arms as best she could with one arm and a broken rib. Every breath hurt, but she deserved it. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Zach.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her face anymore. \u201cGo away, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zach,\u201d she said again, hearing the smallness of those words. She\u2019d held them in her hands like a fragile flower, thinking they would bloom somehow when she offered them to him; how na\u00efve she\u2019d been.</p><p>Jude came into the room, carrying Mia\u2019s purse and a can of Coke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lexi stammered, trying to stop her stupid, useless tears. Failing.</p><p>Then her aunt was beside her, taking hold of her hand. \u201cCome away, Alexa. This is not the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Jude said dully, as if she\u2019d just processed Lexi\u2019s apology. \u201cYou killed my Mia.\u201d Her voice broke on that. \u201cWhat is sorry supposed to mean to me?\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt her aunt stiffen, straighten. \u201cThis from the woman who knew her children were going to drink and gave them car keys. I\u2019m sorry, but Lexi is not the only one responsible here.\u201d</p><p>Jude drew back as if she\u2019d been slapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lexi said again, letting her aunt pull her away. When she finally dared to turn back around, Jude was still there, standing beside Zach\u2019s bed, clinging to her daughter\u2019s purse.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Eva said, coming to a stop.</p><p>Lexi was crying so hard, she could hardly tell what was going on around her. She felt Eva\u2019s grip on her wrist tighten. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she whispered, not really caring. She glanced down the hallway. His door was closed now.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>Lexi turned, wiped her eyes.</p><p>A police officer was standing outside her room.</p><p>Eva held Lexi\u2019s hand as they walked down the hallway. At their approach, the officer straightened. He pulled a small notepad out of his shirt pocket. \u201cAre you Alexa Baill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cI have a few questions for you. About the accident,\u201d he said, uncapping his pen.</p><p>Eva looked up at him. \u201cI may work at Walmart, sir, but I watch Law and Order every week. Alexa will be getting an attorney. He\u2019ll tell her what questions she can answer.\u201d</p><p>Jude shut the door. She was shaking so hard it took a real effort to hold on to the knob and pull.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>She heard her son\u2019s voice, heard the pain in it, and she moved automatically to his bedside.</p><p>It was where she was supposed to be, where she belonged. So she stood there, holding Mia\u2019s purse and pretending to be whole. But every time she looked down at the quilted pink leather in her hands, she thought of the stuffed puppy Mia had loved, Daisy Doggy, and the footed jammies she\u2019d worn as a child and the color her daughter\u2019s cheeks had been yesterday ...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, not Lexi\u2019s,\u201d Zach said miserably.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s...\u201d Jude\u2019s voice broke like an old twig, snapped into quiet. She wondered dully if she\u2019d ever be able to look at Zach again without wanting to cry. It was all so tangled up\u2014her memories of Mia were inextricably bound with images of Zach. Her babies. Her twins. But now there was only the one, and when she looked at him, all she saw was the empty space beside him where Mia should have been.</p><p>She wanted to say the right thing to him, but she didn\u2019t know what that was anymore, and she was so exhausted. She couldn\u2019t put her words through a mill and crank out smaller, prettier versions. It took every scrap of courage she had just to stand here, to stand by him and pretend he\u2019d done nothing terrible and pretend they would all be fine.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he said, looking at her through green eyes swimming in tears.</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the designated driver but I drank. It\u2019s my fault. How do I get through this?\u201d</p><p>Jude had no answer for him.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he cried. \u201cYou always tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t always listen, do you?\u201d The words were out before she could stop them. She should have taken them back, at least wished them back, but she was too broken right now to care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said miserably. He took her hand, squeezed it. She felt his touch like a shimmer of heat on the road: distant, fleeting.</p><p>\u201cShe would forgive you, Zach,\u201d Jude said. It was the truth, and all she could think of.</p><p>Jude stared dully out the window. I do not forgive you. The last words she\u2019d said to Mia.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I just tell her I wanted to go to USC?\u201d</p> <p>Jude thought about telling him about Mia\u2019s last decision to go to SCC with Lexi and Zach, but what was the point? It would only hurt him more to learn how much Mia loved him.</p><p>\u201cMom? Maybe I\u2019ll go anyway. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>Jude saw how desperate Zach was for her approval, and it broke her heart. As if a college choice could undo all of this tragedy somehow and return their family to them. It was her fault he felt this way. She\u2019d made college so damned important, and he wanted her love as much as he needed Mia. She knew she should talk to him about this, tell him it was a bad idea; her voice was gone, though. All she could think about was the woman she\u2019d been before. The mother to whom USC had been so important.</p><p>I do not forgive you.</p><p>She flinched at the memory of those last terrible words. \u201cNone of this matters now, Zach. Just sleep.\u201d</p> <p>She knew she should say something more, help him with his grief, but what good were words to them now? She looked away from her son\u2019s sad, sad eyes and stared out the window at a bright and shiny day.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>It felt like they\u2019d been at the hospital for days, but it had been less than thirteen hours. While Jude sat at Zach\u2019s bedside, news of the accident spread through Pine Island. By early evening, the phone calls had begun. Jude answered the first few, eager to have something to do, to think about beside her loss, but within seconds she knew it had been a terrible mistake. Even as she listened to murmurs of support, she heard the relief in other people\u2019s voices, the immense gratitude that it wasn\u2019t their child who had died. She heard I\u2019m so sorry until she despised those words as she had never despised anything in her life, and she discovered an anger in her soul that was new. Toxic.</p><p>Finally, she turned off her phone and buried it in her purse and let Miles handle the condolences. She drank so much coffee she felt jittery, a racehorse at the gate with no race to run. A mother of twins who only had one child.</p><p>She paced the hallways, walked up and down the bright corridors, seeing nothing. She couldn\u2019t sit by Zach anymore, couldn\u2019t talk to Miles, couldn\u2019t go see Mia. Her existence was defined by that which she couldn\u2019t do or have. So she kept moving, sobbing on and off, clutching wads of Kleenex that turned into soggy gray lumps in her hand.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d She heard her name as if from a distance and looked up, disoriented. Where was she?</p> <p>Molly was in front of her, holding an overnight bag clutched to her stomach. Without makeup on, dressed in pink Juicy sweatpants and a white cardigan, with her white hair a spiky mess, she looked as ruined as Jude felt inside.</p><p>Molly moved toward her awkwardly, let the bag thump to the floor between them. She kicked it aside and took Jude in her arms. When Molly began to cry, Jude felt as if she were floating away, disappearing, only her friend\u2019s embrace kept her in this corridor at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Jude said, easing out of Molly\u2019s arms. \u201cPlease.\u201d Her eyes felt painfully dry, sandpapery, and yet her vision was blurred. She saw now where she was\u2014near the entrance to the waiting room.</p><p>Molly tried gamely to smile, but it didn\u2019t work. \u201cI brought you some clothes. Toothbrush. Whatever I could think of.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. The last thing in the world she wanted was to stand here, pretending she wasn\u2019t shattered inside, but she couldn\u2019t make herself move, either.</p><p>Just down the hall, in the waiting room, she saw the crowd of women sitting together, watching Jude from a safe distance. They were women she knew from the island, women with whom she\u2019d chaired committees, played tennis, had lunch. Women with whom she\u2019d shared both motherhood and friendship. Neighbors, friends, acquaintances. They\u2019d heard about the accident and come to help in whatever way they could, the modern equivalent of a quilting bee. In hard times, these women came together to help one another. Jude knew all of this because she was one of them. If someone else\u2019s child had been killed, Jude would have put everything else aside and come to offer help.</p><p>They needed to support her. Jude could see that, but she couldn\u2019t seem to care about it.</p> <p>How could she make them understand that the woman they knew was gone? She wasn\u2019t the woman who\u2019d befriended them anymore.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the durable woman she\u2019d always imagined herself to be. She wasn\u2019t courageous. If she\u2019d been a soldier in wartime, there would be no hill charge led by her. She wouldn\u2019t throw her body on a grenade.</p><p>Rather, she froze.</p><p>There was no better word for it. All the strength she had\u2014and it was a slippery thing, her strength, as small as a guppy and as hard to hold\u2014she used to control her emotions. She didn\u2019t see how she could accept sympathy or make other people feel included. It took everything she had inside to pretend to be \u201chandling\u201d this.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here for you, Jude,\u201d Molly said. \u201cWe all are. What can we do to help?\u201d</p><p>Help. It was what women did for one another, even when there was no way to accomplish it.</p><p>She took a deep breath and tried to straighten her shoulders. The attempt was a dismal failure, and she ended up rounded again, a woman curling up inside like a thin strip of wood. Still, she clutched Molly\u2019s hand and moved forward, one step at a time.</p><p>The women in the waiting room rose as one, an audience getting to its feet.</p><p>Jude moved into their midst, let them surround her, hold her. She wished they wouldn\u2019t cry, but they did, and their tears kept hers at bay.</p><p>Jude stayed as long as she could, engulfed by the women who\u2019d defined her for years, feeling desperately alone. As soon as possible, she got back to her feet, shaky now, more vulnerable than before, and ran back to the quiet in Zach\u2019s room.</p><p>For the next twenty hours, she rarely ventured into the hallway again. She knew people were out there, hovering and drifting and whispering\u2014Molly and her husband, Tim, and several of their island neighbors, and her mother, but Jude didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She and Zach sat together, both staring dully at the TV hanging from the ceiling, saying little. Mia\u2019s absence filled the antiseptic-scented air, and her loss was all either wanted to talk about, but neither had the strength to form such painful words, so they sat in silence. The only time they turned the channel was when the news came on. The media had picked up the story of the accident, and neither Jude nor Zach could stand to watch the coverage. Miles, thankfully, handled the influx of calls with a calm \u201cno comment.\u201d</p><p>Finally, on Tuesday morning, the hospital discharged Zach.</p><p>On the drive home, Miles kept up a steady stream of conversation. He was trying to \u201cgo on,\u201d to merge into the lane of their new existence, but neither Jude nor Zach could go there with him. Each of Miles\u2019s attempts landed in the big empty backseat of the Escalade, and he eventually gave up, turning on the radio instead.</p><p>\u201c... Pine Island teen killed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude snapped it off and the silence returned. She slumped in her leather seat, with the heat cranked high enough to warm her frozen core, staring dully out the window as the ferry pulled into port. She was so mired in grief that she hardly saw the familiar island landscape until all at once she recognized her surroundings.</p><p>Miles had turned onto Night Road.</p><p>She gave a gasp of recognition. \u201cMiles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said. \u201cHabit.\u201d</p><p>The trees on either side of them were giants that blocked out the struggling mid-June sun. Deep shadows lay banked on either side. High in one of the branches, a lone eagle perched proudly, watching something far below.</p><p>They turned a hairpin corner, and there it was: the scene of the accident. Twin skid marks scarred the gray asphalt. A tree was cracked, half of it fallen aside. At its base, a memorial had sprung up.</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d Zach said from the backseat.</p><p>Jude wanted to look away but she couldn\u2019t. The ravine between the road and the broken tree was strewn with bouquets of flowers, stuffed animals, high school pennants, and photos of Mia. Parked along the side of the road was a van with a satellite disk perched on top: a local news vans. Jude knew what she\u2019d see on the evening news tonight: images of teenagers, kids she\u2019d known since they had gaps in their teeth, looking haggard and drawn now, older, crying about Mia\u2019s death, laying mementos of her short life on the ground, holding lit votives in small glass jars.</p><p>And what would happen to all those stuffed animals that had been put here? Fall would come and rain would pound the color out of everything, and this place would become another ragged reminder of their loss.</p><p>Less than a mile, she thought as Miles turned onto their gravel driveway.</p><p>Mia had died less than a mile from home. They could have walked ...</p><p>At the front door was another shrine. Friends and neighbors had layered the entrance with flowers. When Jude got out of the car, she smelled the sweet, heady fragrance, but already some were fading, their petals beginning to curl and turn brown.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of it,\u201d she said to Miles.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, Jude. It means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it means,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cPeople loved our daughter\u2014a girl who is never coming home again.\u201d Her voice caught, and she hated how overwhelmed she felt when she looked at these flowers. She would have done the same thing for a neighbor\u2019s child, and she would have cried as she bought the flowers and placed them here. She would have felt an incredible sense of loss, and the sharp, sweet relief of knowing that her kids were okay. \u201cThey\u2019ll just die,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>Miles pulled her into his arms.</p><p>Zach came up beside them, leaned into Jude. She wanted to put her arm around him, but she felt paralyzed. It took concentration just to breathe with the cloying scent of all these flowers.</p><p>\u201cShe liked white roses,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>At that, the grief came at Jude again. How had she not known that about Mia? All those hours she\u2019d spent in her garden and never had she planted a single creamy white rose. She looked down at the flowers by her front door. There were dahlias, zinnias, and roses of every color except white.</p><p>In a burst of anger, she scooped up all the flowers and carried them over to the woods behind the garage and threw them into the trees.</p><p>She was just about to turn away when something white caught her eye.</p><p>An unopened rosebud lay on the top of the flowery heap, its petals as rich in color as fresh cream.</p><p>Jude scrambled through the brush, feeling stinging nettles lash across her face and hands, burning her skin, but she didn\u2019t care. She picked up the lone rosebud, clutching it in one shaking hand, feeling the prick of thorns.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>She heard Miles\u2019s voice coming at her. Clutching the single stem, she looked back at him.</p><p>In the harsh sunlight, he looked slight suddenly, fragile. She saw the hollows of his cheeks and the spidery look of his fingers as he reached out. He took her hand and helped her to her feet. She stared up into the gray eyes that had been her only real home and all she saw now was emptiness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They walked into their home, which was bright with lights and sweltering hot.</p><p>The first thing Jude saw was a shamrock-green sweater hanging from the antique hall tree by the door. How many times had she asked Mia to take it up to her room?</p><p>I will, Madre. Honest. Tomorrow ...</p><p>She let go of her husband\u2019s arm. She was about to reach for the sweater when she heard her mother\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cJudith?\u201d</p><p>Her mother stood in the entryway, dressed in an elegant steel-gray fitted blouse and black pants. She reached out, pulled Jude into her arms. Jude wished there was comfort in this embrace, but it was as cold and rote as everything else between them.</p><p>She drew back as quickly as she could, crossing her arms. She was freezing cold suddenly, even though the house was warm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve put the food away,\u201d Mother said. \u201cYour friends have been so supportive. I\u2019ve never seen so many foil-wrapped casseroles in my life. I\u2019ve put everything in the freezer, marked and dated. I\u2019ve also made all the funeral arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Jude looked up sharply. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother looked worriedly at her. \u201cI was trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not having a funeral,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cNo funeral?\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cRemember your parents\u2019 funerals? And I remember my father\u2019s. No way I\u2019m going through that for Mia. We\u2019re not religious. I\u2019m not going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be religious to have a funeral, Judith,\u201d her mother said. \u201cGod will be ther\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare mention God to me. He let her die.\u201d</p> <p>She saw her mother pale, draw back, and, just like that, Jude lost her hold on anger. Without it, she felt so exhausted she could hardly stand.</p><p>\u201cI need to sleep,\u201d she said. Clutching Mia\u2019s purse and the single white rose, she turned her back on her family and stumbled down the hallway to her bedroom, collapsing on her bed.</p><p>Mia\u2019s purse spilled out; the contents lay scattered across the expensive sheets.</p><p>Jude lay on her side, snuggled up to her pillow, staring down at Mia\u2019s things.</p><p>The pink Juicy Couture wallet that had been last year\u2019s Christmas gift. A tube of lip gloss, a bent and mangled tampon, a crumpled-up twenty-dollar bill, a half-empty pack of gum, and a used movie ticket. Inside the wallet was a picture of Zach, Mia, and Lexi taken at senior prom.</p><p>Forgive me?</p><p>If only she\u2019d hugged Mia right then, told her that she loved her. Or if she\u2019d said no to the party. Or taught her children that alcohol was dangerous even though parties were fun. Or insisted on driving them. Or not bought the kids a car or ...</p><p>The list of her regrets grew too heavy, weighed her down; she closed her eyes.</p> <p>Behind her, she heard her bedroom door open and close.</p><p>Miles came toward the bed\u2014she could sense that it was him, but she couldn\u2019t turn toward him or open her eyes. He slipped into bed, pulled her against him. She felt him stroke her hair, and she shivered at his touch, freezing again.</p><p>\u201cYour mother left. She said something about knowing when she wasn\u2019t welcome, which of course is completely untrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve asked about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to grieve, Miles. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never planted a white rose,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ask Mia what flower she liked? Why didn\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing through our whole lives, tilling it up, looking for mistakes. It\u2019ll kill us.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, feeling tears start again.</p><p>God, she was already tired of crying, and it hadn\u2019t even started. She\u2019d been without her daughter for less than three days. The rest of her life stretched out before her like the Gobi Desert.</p><p>\u201cWe have to have a funeral,\u201d Miles said softly.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the thing to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Zach and I need it.\u201d</p><p>Jude pressed her face into the pillow, blotting her tears. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, overcome again by all of it. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now,\u201d she said, closing her eyes.</p><p>Miles left the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>SEATTLE TIMES</p><p>Local Teen Killed in Drunk Driving Accident</p><p>An eighteen-year-old Pine Island girl was killed early yesterday morning in a single car crash on Night Road.</p><p>Mia Farraday, a Pine Island High School senior, was thrown out of a Ford Mustang when it hit a tree, authorities said.</p><p>The driver, eighteen-year-old Alexa Baill, of Port George, was reportedly intoxicated at the time. Another passenger, Zachary Farraday, was also injured in the incident.</p><p>Pine Island Police Officer Roy Avery is \u201ctired of delivering bad news to parents of local teens.\u201d He pointed out that before this most recent fatal crash, an accident in another part of the county killed a sixteen-year-old Woodside girl.</p><p>\u201cBoth wrecks happened on dark, twisty, two-lane roads, and both young drivers had been drinking,\u201d Officer Avery said.</p><p>\u201cWe have to stop these teens from partying. That\u2019s all there is to it. The consequences are tragic. Every year, there\u2019s a grad-party accident. This year, someone was killed.\u201d</p><p>The local chapter of MADD has taken a strong interest in this incident. President Norma Alice Davidson demanded publicly that charges be brought against this young driver. \u201cOnly stiffer penalties will make teens take notice of the danger,\u201d she said.</p><p>Prosecuting attorney Uslan declined to comment about whether Ms. Baill would be charged with DUI vehicular homicide. A memorial service for Mia Farraday will take place Wednesday at Grace Church on Pine Island at 4:00 P.M.</p><p>All over Pine Island, there were reminders of Mia\u2019s death: on the high school reader board, WE MISS YOU, MIA; on the movie marquee, IN MEMORY OF MIA. There were signs in store fronts and taped to car windows.</p><p>But those reminders weren\u2019t the worst of it. Now, as Lexi walked up Main Street, she was bombarded by memories. She and Mia had painted ceramic platters together there, at the Dancing Brush ... they\u2019d bought designer jelly beans at the candy store and books at the bookstores.</p><p>Books.</p><p>That was what had brought them together in the first place, two lonely girls who, before each other, experienced the world from afar, through words.</p><p>Can I sit here?</p><p>Social suicide.</p><p>Eva handed Lexi a wad of toilet paper. \u201cYou\u2019re crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d She wiped her eyes, surprised to find how hard she was crying.</p><p>Eva touched her arm gently. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>The lawyer\u2019s office was just off Main Street, tucked back in a tree-lined quad that housed a yarn shop, an antique shop, and an art gallery.</p><p>The small, squat brick building had big windows and a bright blue door that read: Scot Jacobs, Attorney at Law.</p><p>Lexi followed Eva into the office. The main room held a big oak desk, three plastic chairs, and a framed black-and-white photograph of driftwood on a beach. A tired-looking older woman with black horn-rimmed glasses sat behind the desk.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Alexa,\u201d the receptionist said. \u201cI\u2019m Bea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Bea. This is my Aunt Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou both can go in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d Eva whispered to Lexi.</p><p>Lexi shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d They walked down a narrow hallway, past a conference-type room.</p><p>At the back office, a youngish man sat behind a big glass desk. At their approach, he rose. In a crumpled blue suit and overwashed pink shirt, he looked like the kind of attorney they could afford, and of course they couldn\u2019t really afford him. His hair was unstylishly long, a little tousled, and he needed a shave, but his brown eyes were kind and compassionate.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Lexi said, moving forward to shake his plump, slightly damp hand.</p><p>Lexi sat down in one of the two upholstered chairs that faced the desk. Beside her, Eva put her purse on the floor and sat down in the other chair. \u201cThank you for agreeing to see us,\u201d her aunt said.</p><p>Mr. Jacobs steepled his pale fingers and studied Lexi. \u201cYou\u2019re in a bad spot, Miss Baill. Your accident has sparked a firestorm around here. The regional MADD organization is fired up. They want an example made of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Lexi asked.</p><p>\u201cThey think that if you go to prison, kids will get the message. And a lot of people want to see this message go out to kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison? Prison?\u201d Lexi said, feeling the floor drop out from under her.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a kid,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>\u201cActually, she\u2019s eighteen. That makes her an adult, and she was legally intoxicated at the time of the accident. Of course, at her age, point zero is the legal limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey send girls to prison for an accident like this?\u201d Eva asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen alcohol is involved, they can. They can also go for probation and community service. There are a lot of potential outcomes here, and a lot of choices along the way. That\u2019s what I\u2019m for: to help guide and defend Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what should I do?\u201d Lexi said quietly. She was shaken to her core by the whole idea of this. She\u2019d seen what happened as an accident. It was a crime, though. Now she saw how much more she had to face, and it terrified her.</p><p>\u201cWe fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight? But I did it. I drove drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your car, and you were the least intoxicated of the three,\u201d Scot said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a brain surgeon to figure out what happened. You thought you were the safest among you to drive. And jurors tend to drink. They\u2019ll know a thing like this can happen to anyone. I\u2019ll need to hire an investigator, but you\u2019ll definitely plead not guilty. Last year I defended a man who killed two people in a similar situation, and I got him acquitted. It\u2019s not over till it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Acquitted. Not guilty. How could Lexi ever face Zach in court and say she wasn\u2019t guilty? How could she face anyone on the island and say that? \u201cBut she\u2019s dead. I can\u2019t pretend I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrison isn\u2019t the answer, Lexi. Believe me.\u201d He collated some papers on his desk, thumped them into a packet. \u201cHere\u2019s the plan. You\u2019re going to speak to high school kids and share your story. I\u2019ll set something up for you. It\u2019ll look good if you take responsibility for your actions. Show the community and the media that you can send a message to other teens without going to prison.\u201d He gave her a sad smile. \u201cI know your whole story, Lexi. People will respond to what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He opened a file and looked at it. \u201cYour mother, Lorena Baill, was first arrested in 1986, when you were three months old. You lived with seven foster families in your first fourteen years. Every time your mom got out of rehab or jail, she came back for you. The courts kept giving her chances.\u201d He looked up. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a hard life, Lexi. And you were with your mom when she overdosed.\u201d</p><p>Lexi swallowed hard. It was a memory she tried never to remember. \u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJurors will have sympathy for you.

Nothing. I can\u2019t stress that enough. I will tell them that I\u2019m representing you and find out what I can. If we\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll decide not to charge you. If we\u2019re not...\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>Eva stood up. \u201cThank you, Mr. Jacobs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Scot. Please. And don\u2019t you worry, Lexi. We\u2019ll keep you out of prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about going today?\u201d Eva said.</p><p>Lexi stood at the window, staring outside. \u201cHow can I not go to my best friend\u2019s funeral?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed her,\u201d Lexi said quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to be easy.\u201d She didn\u2019t think anything would ever be easy again. But she had to do this. She had to stand there, ashamed, and let her friends see what came from drinking and driving. And she had to see Zach one more time\u2014and his parents\u2014and tell them how sorry she was.</p><p>She went into the bathroom and sat on the beige fiberglass rim of the bathtub. She closed her eyes and felt Mia beside her. Do you want to come to my house after school? I\u2019ll meet you at the flagpole ... she just came right up to me, Madre, and asked if she could sit down ... move over, Zach Attack, you\u2019re hogging my best friend ...</p> <p>Lexi cried until there was nothing left inside of her. Then, drawing in a deep breath, she exhaled slowly and got to her feet.</p><p>Feeling hollow and shaky, she dressed in a pair of plain black pants, black flats, and a short-sleeved blue angora sweater that Mia had bought for her.</p><p>In the living room, she found Eva standing by the kitchen table, dressed all in black, looking worried. She was gulping coffee\u2014it was what she did when she was nervous; that was one of the things Lexi knew about Eva now. Whenever Eva missed smoking, she drank black coffee until the craving passed. \u201cThis is a bad idea. What if there are reporters there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to face them sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Eva gave her one last worried look, started to say something, and changed her mind. Lips thinned by those unspoken words, she walked out of the double-wide and led the way to the old Ford Fairlane.</p><p>They drove onto the island in silence.</p><p>As they passed the high school, Lexi noticed the reader board. Now it read: Mia Farraday Memorial. Grace Church. 4:00 P.M. today / GRAD SATURDAY @ 1:00.</p><p>The parking lot in front of the church was full.</p> <p>Lexi let out her breath.</p><p>Eva pulled into an empty spot and parked.</p><p>Lexi got out of the car. As she moved forward, her broken arm started to ache and nerves fluttered in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Eva said, taking hold of Lexi\u2019s good arm.</p><p>Inside, the church was full of teenagers and parents and teachers. Up by the altar was a poster of Mia in her costume from Once upon a Mattress. In the beaded blue bodice, with stage makeup emphasizing her green eyes, she looked radiant and beautiful, a young woman with a bright future.</p><p>Lexi stumbled; Eva kept her going.</p><p>Lexi heard people whisper as she passed.</p><p>\u201c... Lexi Baill ... surprise...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... if she\u2019d been a better friend...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... poor thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201c... some nerve...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Lexi, you want to sit here? Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She turned slowly, saw Zach\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Amanda Martin, sitting in the pew to her right.</p><p>Amanda scooted sideways, made her mom and dad scrunch together to make room.</p><p>Lexi sat down by Amanda. She looked into the girl\u2019s sad eyes, and suddenly they were both crying. They hadn\u2019t been friends in high school, but it didn\u2019t matter now; all that stuff just fell away. \u201cIt totally wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what people say.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was surprised by how much that meant to her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Before Amanda could say anything else, the service began.</p><p>The priest said Mia\u2019s name, and every high school girl in the church burst into tears, and more than a few boys joined in. The priest\u2019s words painted a picture of a happy eighteen-year-old girl who was almost Mia and yet not quite. He didn\u2019t say that she snored when she lay on her back or that she moved her lips when she read or that she liked to hold her best friend\u2019s hand while they walked through the mall.</p><p>His words she could withstand. It was the slideshow of Mia\u2019s life that devastated her. Mia in a pink tutu, her arms circled above her head ... Mia holding a Captain Hook action figure, grinning ... holding Zach\u2019s hand as they stood in the cold ocean water, grimacing. The last picture was of Mia alone, wearing a crazy tie-dyed T-shirt and cutoffs, smiling for the camera, giving the world a thumbs-up.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes, sobbing now. Music began to play: it was not the right music. Mia wouldn\u2019t have liked the droning, solemn chords. And somehow that hurt most of all. Whoever had picked the music hadn\u2019t thought of Mia. It should have been a Disney song, something that would have gotten Mia on her feet and made her sing along with her hairbrush as a microphone ...</p><p>Sing with me, Lexster. We could be in a band ... and Zach, laughing, saying, no more, Mia, dogs are starting to howl ...</p><p>Lexi wanted to clamp her hands over her ears, but the words came from inside of her, memories blooming up and spilling over.</p><p>\u201cTime to go, Lexi,\u201d Amanda said gently.</p><p>Lexi opened her eyes. \u201cThanks, for letting me sit with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou coming to graduation?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. Had it only been six days ago she and Mia and Zach had been together in the gym, practicing for graduation? \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>People moved into the aisle, streamed toward the double doors. Lexi felt their gazes on her. Faces frowned in recognition as they passed her. Parents looked judgmental; kids looked sad and sympathetic.</p><p>Finally she saw the family. They sat in the front pew, still and stiff and dressed in black. People paused to offer condolences as they passed.</p><p>Lexi moved toward them, unable to stop herself. She was going against the flow; mourners stared at her, frowned, moved out of her way.</p><p>In the front row, the Farradays rose in unison and turned.</p><p>Neither Jude nor Zach acknowledged her. They just stared, dull-eyed, their faces streaked with tears.</p><p>Lexi had practiced what she would say to them a hundred times, but now, faced with the magnitude of their loss and her guilt, she couldn\u2019t even open her mouth. The whole family turned away from her and walked to the church\u2019s side door.</p><p>Lexi felt Eva come up beside her. She sagged into her aunt, giving up the strength it had taken to come here.</p><p>\u201cNo one blames him,\u201d Eva said bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have been,\u201d Eva said. \u201cWhat good is it to make a promise and then ignore it? He should be blamed, too.\u201d</p><p>Lexi remembered how he\u2019d looked at her in the hospital; the green eyes she loved so much had been darkened by more than grief. She\u2019d seen guilt there, too, as deep as her own. \u201cHe blames himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d Eva said firmly. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She took Lexi by the arm and led her out of the church. Lexi could hear people whispering about her, blaming her. If she\u2019d been less culpable, she might have agreed with Eva, maybe been pissed at Zach, but any other blame was less than hers. That was all there was. Zach had failed to live up to a promise. She\u2019d made the deadly decision herself. Guilt and remorse filled her to the brim; there was no room for anger, too. Zach had screwed up; Lexi had done far, far worse.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should have told me it was a bad idea to go to the funeral,\u201d Lexi said as they drove out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cIf someone had,\u201d Eva said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you would have listened.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wiped her eyes. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat huddled in the limousine\u2019s dark interior. Outside, it began to rain; drops landed on the roof like infant heartbeats.</p><p>She was so deep in grief that when the car door opened, letting in a blast of gray and yellow light, it stung her tear-burned eyes and she looked around, disoriented.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d the driver said, standing by the open door. He was a slash of more black in the rain, a slanted shadow beneath an umbrella. Behind him, Molly and Tim stood huddled with their grown children.</p><p>\u201cCome along, Zachary,\u201d her mother said, herding him out of the limousine.</p><p>Miles slid past Jude and got out of the car. Then he held out his hand for her. \u201cJude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she said, glad that he couldn\u2019t see her eyes behind the dark sunglasses she wore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you,\u201d Miles said to Caroline, who no doubt nodded and walked briskly away, making sure Zach stood up straight and didn\u2019t cry. That was what Jude remembered about her father\u2019s funeral: not crying. No one had cried for him. Her mother simply hadn\u2019t allowed it. She\u2019d treated grief like a malignancy of some kind\u2014a few snips, a few stitches, and you were good as new.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t not go,\u201d Miles said, squatting beside the car. Rain pelted his face, straightened his hair.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>It was their family sound now; before it had been laughter. Now it was the sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I want to be strong enough for this?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself, and I want to be there. I just ... can\u2019t. I\u2019m not ready to watch them lower her into the ground. And I\u2019m sure as hell not ready to stand next to you while you let go of pink balloons.\u201d Her voice broke on that. \u201cLike she\u2019s up in some heaven waiting to catch them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d he said tiredly, and she understood.</p><p>He wanted her to believe that Mia was in a better place, but Jude couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>She knew what it was costing her, this inability of hers to be strong, but she couldn\u2019t do it. There was simply nothing of her left. Try as hard as she might (and honestly, it exhausted her to even try), she couldn\u2019t seem to be present, not even as a mother.</p><p>Zach knew she wasn\u2019t herself anymore. He treated her as if she were made of spun sugar. He approached her warily, making sure never to say anything about Mia. But sometimes, when she said good night to him, she saw the need in his eyes, the naked pain, and it hurt her to her bones. She\u2019d reach for him in those moments, but he wasn\u2019t fooled. He knew it wasn\u2019t her touch, that somehow she wasn\u2019t there, and when she walked away, she saw that he looked more broken after she\u2019d soothed him than before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking Zach\u2019s heart,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI know you know that. He needs you today.\u201d</p><p>Jude swallowed hard. \u201cI know. And I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t stand there. Did you see how they all looked at us at the funeral? All I could think was that I hated them all, with their healthy kids. I look at people who aren\u2019t us and I hate them. And I look at Zach, and all I see is the emptiness beside him. He\u2019s half a person, and we all know it ... and sometimes I can\u2019t help blaming him. If he hadn\u2019t gotten drunk...\u201d She drew in a sharp breath. \u201cOr if I hadn\u2019t let him go that night...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep this up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been less than a week,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd if you tell me time will heal this, I swear to God, I\u2019ll kill you in your sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Miles stared at her a long time and then pulled her into his arms. \u201cI love you, Jude,\u201d he whispered into her ear, and against her best intentions she started to cry.</p><p>She loved him, too. And she loved Zach. It was inside her somewhere. She just couldn\u2019t reach it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her good-bye for you.\u201d</p><p>She heard the car door click shut, and she was alone again. Thankfully. For a long while, she sat there in the darkness, listening to the rain on the roof, trying not to think about anything, but her daughter\u2019s presence was everywhere, in every breath, every sigh, every blink of the eye. Finally, furtively, she reached into her small black purse and pulled out Mia\u2019s cell phone. With a quick glance around, she flipped it open and listened to Mia\u2019s outgoing message.</p><p>Hi! You\u2019ve reached Mia. I\u2019m way too busy to talk now, but if you\u2019ll leave me a message, I\u2019ll totally get back to you.</p> <p>Jude listened to it over and over again, sometimes talking to her daughter, sometimes crying, sometimes just listening. She was so caught up in reaching Mia that she gasped when the door opened. She snapped the phone shut and shoved it in her purse as Zach climbed into the limousine. His eyes were red and swollen.</p><p>Jude slid over to him and took his hand. She hated the way he looked at her\u2014surprised by her touch\u2014and she wanted to offer words of comfort, but she had none.</p><p>She and Zach and Miles slumped together on the long ride home.</p><p>Her mother sat opposite them, her hands clasped in her lap, her beautiful eyes glistening with tears that never fell. Jude was surprised by that sign of emotion, of loss. Only a week ago the sight of her mother\u2019s improbable tears would have amazed Jude, made her want to reach out. Now, she didn\u2019t care. Her own pain crowded out everyone else\u2019s. It was a pathetic, humiliating truth, but a truth nonetheless.</p><p>At the house, Jude got out of the car and walked to the front door alone. All she wanted to do now was sleep. She must have said it out loud because she heard her mother say, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. Sleep will help.\u201d</p><p>Jude seemed to awaken at that. \u201cWill it, Mother? Really?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother patted Jude\u2019s wrist. It was a light touch, barely there before it was gone. \u201cGod doesn\u2019t give us more than we can bear. You\u2019re stronger than this, Judith.\u201d</p><p>Anger blindsided Jude. It was one of her new emotions. She had never been angry before, not really, but it was always with her now, as much a part of her as the shape of her face and the color of her skin. It took tremendous effort not to show it all the time. She spun away from her mother before she said something she would regret and headed into the house.</p><p>In the entryway, she came to a halt. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mia\u2019s sweater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zach said, coming up behind her.</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s green sweater. It was hanging right here.\u201d Jude\u2019s anger mutated into panic.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the laundry,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI was going to wash it along with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude ran to the laundry room and pawed through the pile of dirty clothes until she found Mia\u2019s sweater. Bringing it to her face, she pressed the soft wool to her nose, inhaling Mia\u2019s scent. Her tears dampened the fabric, but she didn\u2019t care. Ignoring her family\u2019s stares, she stumbled into her bedroom and slammed the door shut behind her, collapsing on the bed.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like hours, she heard her bedroom door open.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Molly said from the doorway. She stood there, looking sad and uncertain in a chic black dress with a cinch belt, wringing her hands together. Her white hair was a mess, pulled back from her face in a thin headband; a black grow-out line spread along her forehead. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I stop you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jude crawled to a sit, leaned back against her silk upholstered headboard.</p><p>Molly got up onto the big bed and took Jude into her arms, holding her as if she were a child. Jude didn\u2019t mean to cry again, but she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI used to think I was strong,\u201d Jude whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou are strong,\u201d Molly said, tucking a damp strand of hair behind Jude\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cI have no idea who I am anymore.\u201d It was true. All of this had shown her the truth of her soul: she was weak, fragile. Not the woman she\u2019d imagined herself to be at all.</p><p>Or maybe that wasn\u2019t true. Maybe she knew now what she hadn\u2019t known before: she wasn\u2019t kind and caring and compassionate and even-tempered. She was angry and weak and even a little vindictive. Most of all, she was a bad mother.</p><p>Everything lately pissed her off. Sunshine. Healthy children. Parents who complained about their kids. Lexi.</p><p>Jude suddenly didn\u2019t want to be touched. She pulled out of Molly\u2019s arms and slumped back against the headboard. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t wearing her seatbelt.\u201d She said it quietly, afraid; it had only been a few days, and already Jude had learned that people didn\u2019t want to hear about Mia. How was she supposed to stop talking about her daughter? But just the mention of her name could send people running for the door.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Molly said, holding her hand, settling in beside her.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jude said. \u201cNo one wants to hear about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen to anything you want to say.\u201d</p><p>Jude turned to her. \u201cShe always wore her seatbelt.\u201d She drew in a shaking breath and reached over into the nightstand for tissues.</p><p>A mistake; she saw that instantly.</p><p>Inside the drawer, she saw a small blue velvet ring box sitting beside a pair of Costco reading glasses. Knowing she shouldn\u2019t touch it, she took it out, flipped it open.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Molly asked.</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s graduation present.\u201d</p><p>Molly was silent for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to take her shopping with me for the stone. A girls\u2019 day. Maybe a mani-pedi when we were done.\u201d On that, Jude\u2019s resolve cracked, and she started to cry.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jude,\u201d Molly said, hugging her again.</p><p>Jude should have felt enveloped by her friend\u2019s love, but she couldn\u2019t feel anything at all. Not then, as she stared down at this beautiful, unfinished ring with gaping, empty prongs ...</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>The high school parking lot was full of cars on this sunny Saturday afternoon.</p><p>Lexi sat in the passenger seat of her aunt\u2019s Ford Fairlane, staring through the grimy windshield at the crowd gathered around the flagpole.</p><p>\u201cYou belong here, Alexa,\u201d her aunt said. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked as hard for this day as anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d her aunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Lexi took a deep breath and reached for the door handle. The old door creaked open, popping at the end of its arc.</p><p>She and Eva walked through the chattering crowd of family and friends who had come to see the class of 2004 graduate. Lexi kept her head down, not making eye contact with the reporters at the flagpole. As she passed them, she heard one of them say, \u201cTwo hundred and seventy-two seniors, Phil. It should have been two hundred and seventy-three.\u201d</p><p>At the edge of the football field, Lexi paused.</p><p>\u201cYou better hurry,\u201d Eva said. \u201cWe\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded, but as she looked at the rows of folding chairs set up on the green football field, she felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Alexa,\u201d her aunt said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl. And don\u2019t you dare think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Eva gave her a bright smile and then disappeared into the crowd of proud parents streaming up into the bleachers.</p><p>Lexi saw the Farradays up there. Jude and Miles were seated in the second row, with Molly and Tim and Grandmother Caroline. Even from here, Lexi could see how pale and thin Jude looked. The black sunglasses she wore accentuated the pallor of her skin and the sharpness of her cheekbones. She had no lipstick on, and she was carrying Mia\u2019s pink purse.</p><p>Lexi knew then she couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t walk through this crowd and go into the gymnasium, where all her friends were dressed in caps and gowns, waiting to walk triumphantly to the seats on the field. She couldn\u2019t see Zach, not on this day, when Mia\u2019s absence would be so keenly felt.</p><p>She pulled off her cap and unzipped her gown, stuffing them both in her big patchwork purse. She was about to leave when the class of 2004 filed onto the field, a stream of royal blue and marigold yellow robes against a cloudless sky.</p><p>She moved into one of the empty aisles beneath the bleachers. On the field below, her classmates moved into their assigned seats.</p><p>Zach was walking alone. In sunglasses (probably to protect his burned eyes in this bright sunlight), with his shaved head and burned jawline, he hardly looked like himself. Like Jude, there was a new hollowness to his face, and he wasn\u2019t smiling.</p><p>When the last of the seniors had taken their seats, the audience burst into applause.</p><p>Amid the noise, Principal Yates walked onto the stage and stood at the podium. He spoke eloquently about Pine Island and what it was like to grow up on land that was surrounded by water, how it strengthened the sense of community. At the end of his speech, he said, \u201cThis is a class that has been touched by a sudden, terrible tragedy, and these students who were on their way to adulthood have grown up in the past week. We hope as they move forward and are faced with choices in their lives, both big and small, they will remember what they learned about consequences in the year 2004.\u201d He gave the class a sad, knowing smile. \u201cAnd now, Amanda Martin is going to sing a song in memory of a very special girl, who should have been with us today.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tried to steel herself, but when the music began, she felt a terrible ache in her chest. And then Amanda\u2019s voice, pure and sweet, rang out: \u201cI can show you the world ... shining, shimmering, splendid...\u201d</p><p>The song brought Mia bursting back to life, twirling on the dance floor, singing off-key. She\u2019d loved the Disney movies so much. I\u2019m Ariel, she used to say all the time. You\u2019re Belle. No Snow White or Cinderella, not for us; we\u2019re the new-school Disney girls ... we go for what we want ...</p><p>Lexi wasn\u2019t the only one sobbing when Amanda finished her song. At least half of the senior class was crying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The applause was thunderous, and when it faded once again, the commencement began.

People looked around.</p><p>Onstage, the principal cleared his throat and went on. \u201cAndrew Clark...\u201d</p> <p>Lexi\u2019s heart pounded. She was sure someone would point to her, yell, \u201cThere she is; there\u2019s the girl who killed Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZachary Farraday.\u201d</p><p>Zach walked woodenly up the aisle and onto the stage. He took his diploma from the principal and faced the bleachers. Slowly, he upheld a framed photograph of Mia and then leaned closer to the microphone. \u201cShe wanted to do a cartwheel today...\u201d</p><p>A cartwheel, Lexster ... that would get their attention.</p><p>Lexi sagged back against the sun-warmed concrete wall, closing her eyes. The ceremony went on, calling names and handing out diplomas, but she hardly noticed. All she could hear were memories, things Mia had said to her over the years ...</p> <p>\u201cLex?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath and opened her eyes to see Zach standing in front of her. Behind them, down on the field, there was sound and color and movement, but here it was quiet and still. They were alone in an alcove beneath the bleachers. \u201cH-how did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hoped for this moment, dreamed of it, thought of ways to make him understand how sorry she was, but she could see that he knew, that he understood. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said softly. It was the only thing that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, shrugged. She understood the gesture perfectly: it meant that nothing mattered anymore, their love least of all. His look was the saddest thing she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never forgive me, will you?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me I can\u2019t forgive,\u201d he said, and on that, his voice broke and he turned away from her. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She reached into her purse, burrowed past the polyester of her gown, and pulled out her worn, dog-eared copy of Jane Eyre. It was a stupid gift for a girl to give a boy, but it was all she had that mattered to her. \u201cI want you to have this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your favorite book. I can\u2019t take\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. It has a happy ending.\u201d</p><p>He reached out; for a second, they were both touching the book. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Good-bye, Zach,\u201d she whispered, watching him walk away from her.</p> <p>She pulled away from the wall and walked out beneath the bleachers. She didn\u2019t bother to hunch her shoulders or avert her eyes. She didn\u2019t care if people stared at her.</p><p>In the parking lot, she climbed into Eva\u2019s old car and waited.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t do it, huh?\u201d Eva said later, when she got behind the wheel.</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cWho cares? It\u2019s just a dumb ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d Lexi said, realizing as she said it that her whole life would now be divided into two parts: before she\u2019d killed her best friend, and after.</p><p>Graduation was more than Jude could handle. The day had been full of ghosts, missing faces, the wrong girls ...</p><p>By the time the ceremony finally ended, she felt like crumbling into a heap. She\u2019d tried to convince Zach to go to the grad-night party with his friends. You\u2019ll always remember it, she\u2019d said tiredly, although they both knew it was a lie. Intellectually, she knew she should make him go, pretend that his life was still going forward on the same old track, but she couldn\u2019t really feel that.</p><p>So they\u2019d driven home in silence. She sat slumped against the car window, cold to the bone even though the seat\u2019s heater was set on high. In the seat behind her, Zach drummed his fingers on the seat rest, and when they got home, he bolted out of the car and ran up the stairs. No doubt he wanted to lose himself in video games.</p><p>\u201cLexi was there,\u201d Miles said later, when he and Jude were alone in the kitchen.</p><p>Jude felt a rush of anger. Whole, healthy Lexi, with just a white arm cast to mark her place in the car that night.</p><p>\u201cThat takes nerve. I hope Zach didn\u2019t see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Miles said, looking at her. \u201cDon\u2019t do that, Jude. You\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse? Are you kidding me? How could this possibly get worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make Zach choose between you and Lexi. He loves you; you know that. He\u2019s always done everything he could to make you proud of him. Don\u2019t use that against him now. He and Lexi have things to work out.\u201d</p><p>Jude sighed heavily and headed to her bedroom, closing the door behind her.</p><p>For the next forty-eight hours all she did was lie in bed, sometimes sleeping, sometimes crying. She lay there with her eyes closed for hours, thinking come to me, Mia, talking to her daughter, but nothing happened. Not a breeze across her face that felt like a breath, not a flickering of the bedside lamp. Nothing. And she didn\u2019t really believe that Mia could hear her.</p><p>By the time she finally crawled out of bed, she looked like a ninety-year-old homeless woman who had found a designer dress on the street and worn it for weeks. She knew Miles didn\u2019t understand. Last night he\u2019d made that sound\u2014that sigh of desperation or despair\u2014when she couldn\u2019t change into a nightgown. He didn\u2019t understand how fragile she felt. If she lifted her arms, they might break off.</p><p>She changed into an old pair of sweats. Not bothering to shower or brush her teeth, she made her way out of the bedroom, drawn forward by the scent of Starbucks coffee.</p><p>Miles was in the kitchen, sitting at the granite counter, sipping coffee. At her entrance, he sat up straighter, gave her a smile of relief that should have warmed her broken heart.</p><p>The television was on. Before Jude could say anything, she heard the newscaster say, \u201c... killed her best friend in a drunk-driving incident only a week before graduation.\u201d</p><p>Jude shouldn\u2019t have looked at the screen, but she did. The twisted, ruined Mustang with the windshield shattered made her almost violently ill. She hadn\u2019t seen that image before ... and then Lexi\u2019s face was on-screen, smiling brightly. \u201cLocal MADD president Norma\u2014\u201d</p><p>Miles hit the remote, and the screen went black.</p><p>Jude felt that new anger rising in her again; it drowned out everything else. She heard Miles talking to her, but she couldn\u2019t hear anything except this roaring white noise in her head. She poured herself a cup of coffee and walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>How would she survive this? How could she see Lexi again on the street someday and not just fall to her knees?</p><p>Lexi, who could go on with her life ...</p><p>Jude stood in the great room, trembling, wondering what to do. Should she go back to bed?</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying to clear her mind of the image she\u2019d just seen of Zach\u2019s car ...</p><p>At first, she thought she heard her heart beating, and she thought: that\u2019s odd, and then she realized someone was knocking on the front door. Wiping her eyes, she went to the door, expecting to see a friend with a casserole, saying, I\u2019m so sorry, but it was a stranger who stood there, a tall, elegant-looking, gray-haired man in a pinstriped blue suit.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Farraday. I don\u2019t know if you remember me. I\u2019m Dennis Uslan. I\u2019m the prosecuting attorney assigned to your case. My niece, Helen, graduated with Zachary.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s breath released in a rush. She hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d been holding it. \u201cYes, Dennis. Of course I remember you. You helped with construction of the new ball field at Rotary Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry to simply stop by, but your phone seems to be off the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReporters,\u201d she said, stepping back. \u201cThey call constantly asking for a \u2018comment on our tragedy.\u2019 Come in.\u201d She led him into the great room, where sunlight shone through the giant windows. The view over the Sound was spectacular on this crystalline day.</p><p>Dennis had just taken a seat when Miles walked into the room, dressed in shorts for running.</p><p>\u201cMiles,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThis is Dennis Uslan. He\u2019s the prosecuting attorney for our case.\u201d</p><p>Miles looked at Dennis. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware we had a case.\u201d</p><p>Dennis rose from his seat. \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to speak to you about. I\u2019m getting a lot of pressure from MADD and the community to charge Alexa Baill with DUI vehicular homicide. Obviously a trial can be a lengthy and heartbreaking undertaking, and I wanted to know where you stand on the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would happen to Lexi?\u201d Miles asked.</p><p>\u201cIf convicted, she could face more than fifteen years in prison, although, admittedly, that outcome is extreme. She could also be found not guilty or plea bargain to something lesser. Any way you go, though, it\u2019s tough on the victim\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>Jude flinched at the word victim.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it will help anyone if Lexi goes to prison,\u201d Miles said. \u201cWe need to forgive her, not punish her. Maybe other kids could learn from her mistake? She could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive her?\u201d Jude couldn\u2019t believe what her husband had just said.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Farraday,\u201d Dennis asked, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Jude knew the right answer, knew what she would have said before all of this, what she would have believed: that Miles was right. Only forgiveness could ease Jude\u2019s pain.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t that woman anymore. \u201cJustice,\u201d she said at last, seeing Miles\u2019s disappointment in her. \u201cWhat mother wouldn\u2019t want that?\u201d</p><p>In the nine days since high school graduation, Lexi had become a lost soul. On Monday morning, she\u2019d shown up bright and early for work at the ice cream shop, only to be told (kindly, but told just the same) that she\u2019d been fired. Try and understand, Mrs. Solter had said, there\u2019s a lot of anger against you in town right now. It would be bad for business to have you working here.</p><p>After that Lexi had stayed home, reading one book after another. For the first time in years, she turned to Jane Eyre for comfort. She was reading it again when someone knocked on her door.</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?</p><p>\u201cYour lawyer is here.\u201d</p><p>Lexi put down her book and went out to the living room.</p><p>\u201cThey filed charges against you,\u201d Scot said before Lexi even sat down. \u201cDUI vehicular homicide and assault. Your arraignment is Wednesday. We\u2019ll plead not guilty and get a court date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot guilty?\u201d Lexi said, trying to process it all. She didn\u2019t even know what she felt anymore.</p><p>\u201cThe question is not whether you were driving or whether Mia died. It\u2019s about legal responsibility. You had an accident. You didn\u2019t commit a crime. So our plan is...\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t hear anything past \u201cresponsibility.\u201d Suddenly, she was her own mother, trying to run away from what she\u2019d done. \u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scot looked at her. \u201cNo, what, Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to plead guilty,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly will not,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>Lexi loved her aunt for that. \u201cCome on, Eva. Am I supposed to get away with killing my best friend? I did it, and we can\u2019t afford\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou will not plead guilty,\u201d Eva said again. \u201cI have the money in my retirement fund.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting your emotions run wild,\u201d Scot said. \u201cI can see that you\u2019re a good person, and you want to do the right thing, but pleading guilty isn\u2019t it. DUI vehicular homicide is a class-A felony, punishable by up to life in prison. Believe me, prison is not where you want to be, Lexi. And with the sentiment out there ... we have to fight for your freedom.\u201d</p><p>Could she stand up in court and say she wasn\u2019t guilty when everyone knew she was? \u201cWe all know what\u2019s right here. Don\u2019t you want me to do the right thing, Aunt Eva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too young to know what\u2019s right here, Lexi. You did a terrible thing. I admit it. But is prison the answer? No. You were there; you visited your mother.\u201d Eva moved closer. She cupped Lexi\u2019s face in her chapped, dry hands. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about me, but don\u2019t be. We can afford whatever we have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you pled guilty and we got a plea bargain,\u201d Scot said, \u201cthe judge wouldn\u2019t have to follow it. He can impose any sentence he wants, within the guidelines. And with the media out there, he may want to make an example of you. You could spend your life behind bars, Lexi.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am an example,\u201d Lexi said quietly. \u201cI am the worst thing that can happen, and kids should know that. How can I stand in that courtroom and say I\u2019m not guilty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t enough bad come from that night?\u201d Eva asked.</p><p>\u201cThis discussion is over. You\u2019re paying me for my advice, and this is it: you\u2019re pleading not guilty,\u201d Scot said firmly.</p><p>Lexi sighed. They were talking about the law and her future. That wasn\u2019t really the point at all, but they were trying so hard to save her. She didn\u2019t want to disappoint them, too. Especially not Eva. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat in the courtroom between her husband and her son. Zach sat perfectly upright, as she\u2019d often begged him to do. Gone was the slouching, playful kid he\u2019d been. Now he pulled his pants up and wore a belt and cleaned his room without being asked. She knew why, too: he was trying so hard to make her happy. He lived in fear of saying or doing the wrong thing around her, of making her cry. Especially here, in front of everyone they knew.</p><p>The benches in the courtroom filled up quickly. As soon as word had gotten out about Lexi\u2019s arrest and arraignment, admittance to this courtroom had become the hottest ticket in town. People had lined up before dawn in the hopes that they would get a seat. Everyone had an opinion on the case: some thought Lexi was a victim; others deemed her a danger to society. Some blamed Jude and Miles for lackluster supervision and bad parenting; these were the parents who swore their own children didn\u2019t drink. A few whack jobs even blamed the drinking age, saying that if it were eighteen, things like this wouldn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Local reporters, and perhaps one or two national journalists, milled through the hallway outside. Jude didn\u2019t look around, didn\u2019t want to see the friends she\u2019d made over her years here on Pine Island, the women she\u2019d talked to during class parties or in the carpool lane or in the checkout line at Safeway. Many of them called her regularly, and she took the calls, but they rarely lasted long. Jude simply couldn\u2019t think of what to say anymore. Neither did she care about representatives of MADD, who had conducted a press conference just this morning and were demanding prison time for Lexi.</p><p>Lexi.</p><p>Just the name was enough to send Jude spiraling into anger or despair. She did her best never to think about the girl who\u2019d caused all of this, who\u2019d killed her daughter. The girl her son had loved. The girl she\u2019d loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late,\u201d her mother said, taking a seat on Zach\u2019s other side.</p><p>The judge cracked his gravel down and called for order.</p><p>The gallery quieted.</p><p>\u201cMs. Baill,\u201d the judge said, \u201cyou are aware of the crimes with which you have been charged?\u201d</p><p>At the defendant\u2019s table, Lexi and her lawyer stood. She looked incredibly fragile and small standing there. Her hair was unkempt and frizzy, out of control. Her cheap black pants needed ironing and were a little too short.</p> <p>\u201cI am, Your Honor,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cAnd on the charge of DUI vehicular homicide, how do you plead?\u201d</p><p>Lexi paused. \u201cGuilty, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of stunned surprise in the courtroom and then pandemonium broke out. Both attorneys jumped to their feet, yelling over each other to be heard.</p><p>\u201cIn my chambers,\u201d the judge said harshly. \u201cNow. You, too, Ms. Baill.\u201d</p><p>Lexi followed her attorney out of the courtroom. In their wake, the gallery started whispering furiously among themselves.</p><p>Zach turned to Jude. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. What\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>Jude sat very still, breathing as best she could, trying to feel nothing. This was some kind of ruse, a way to garner sympathy. She couldn\u2019t have answered Zach if she had known what to say. Finally, the lawyers filed back into the courtroom. The crowd quieted.</p><p>The judge sat down and looked at Lexi. \u201cAnd on the charge of vehicular assault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty, Your Honor,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>The judge nodded. \u201cMs. Baill, it is my duty to remind you that you have the right to a trial in this case, to have your actions judged by a jury of your peers. You understand that by pleading guilty, you are relinquishing this right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you understand that a guilty plea means that you will be convicted of this crime without a trial and that you may be subject to immediate sentencing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Your Honor,\u201d she said again, stronger this time.</p><p>\u201cAlthough it is unusual, given the terrible consequences of this case on the community, this court is prepared to put this matter to rest. Ms. Baill, do you have a statement you\u2019d like to make?\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded briefly and rose. \u201cI do, Your Honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may go to the podium,\u201d he directed.</p><p>Lexi walked over to the podium and looked out over the gallery. Her gaze went to Zach. \u201cI drank, and I drove, and I killed my best friend. My lawyer tells me that guilt or innocence is a question of law, but he\u2019s wrong. How can I atone? That\u2019s the real question. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I can only pay for it and say how deeply, deeply sorry I am. I love ... Zach and the Farradays and Mia. I will always love them, and I pray that someday they will hear those words from me and not be hurt by them. Thank you.\u201d She returned to her place at the defendant\u2019s table and sat down.</p><p>The judge looked down at some papers spread in front of him. \u201cI have an amicus brief from Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, asking for a sentence that will make an example of Ms. Baill and let other teens know what they could face in similar circumstances. And now, to the family.\u201d He looked up and smiled gently. \u201cI know it\u2019s unexpected, but would any of you like to make a statement to this court?\u201d</p><p>Miles looked at Jude. The prosecuting attorney had told them they\u2019d be allowed to speak after the trial, so they\u2019d thought about what they\u2019d say, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen until weeks from now.</p><p>Jude shrugged, uncertain.</p><p>Miles rose to his feet and stood for a moment. Only the slightest tightening of his jaw betrayed the depth of his emotion. Looking at him now, no one in this room would imagine that he had begun to cry in his sleep.</p><p>He smoothed the pale pink tie at his throat and went to the podium at the front of the room, looking out at their friends and neighbors. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure everyone in this room knows, it has been an incredibly difficult time for my family. There are no words to express the depth of our loss. Still, I\u2019m surprised by Lexi\u2019s plea. I\u2019m sure she was advised not to do so by her counsel.</p><p>\u201cI know Lexi. She\u2019s been like a member of our family for the past few years. I know she would undo all of this if she could, and I am not so na\u00efve as to believe that she is purely at fault and my own children are blameless. I should have forbidden my children to drink instead of remembering my own high school years. I should have been harder on them, perhaps taught them better lessons about alcohol. There is plenty of tragedy to go around here, and plenty of blame. It doesn\u2019t fall on Lexi alone.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Lexi. \u201cI forgive you, Lexi, for what that\u2019s worth, and I admire your decision to plead guilty. I\u2019m not sure I could have advised one of my children to do the same.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Your Honor, for this opportunity to speak,\u201d Miles said at last, looking at the judge. \u201cI ask only that you treat Lexi as a girl who made a terrible mistake and owned up to it, not as a cold-blooded killer. Prison is no answer. It is just another tragedy, and there\u2019s been enough of that.\u201d He turned away from the podium and went back to his seat.</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t make a conscious decision to speak. She stood like some kind of marionette on someone\u2019s strings. Jerkily, awkward. She didn\u2019t even know what she would say until she stood at the podium, staring out at the people she\u2019d known for years. She\u2019d watched their children grow alongside hers, gone to their birthday parties. Some of them had younger kids who had yet to face the upcoming high school drinking parties.</p><p>\u201cI wish to God I hadn\u2019t let my children go to the party that night,\u201d she said quietly, feeling something inside of her break. \u201cI wish they hadn\u2019t gotten drunk. I wish Mia had put on her seatbelt. I wish they had called me to come and get them.\u201d She paused. \u201cI will never hold my daughter again. I won\u2019t do her hair on her wedding day or hold her first baby.\u201d She reached into her pocket and pulled out the ring she\u2019d bought for Mia\u2019s graduation. The gold shone brightly beneath the fluorescent lighting, the empty prongs like fingers reaching. \u201cThis is the ring I was going to give Mia for graduation. I thought a pink pearl would be nice here, but I was going to let her decide.\u201d Her voice weakened on that, and her strength evaporated. She looked at Lexi, sitting there, crying. Those tears should have meant something to Jude; she knew that, but they didn\u2019t. Regret wouldn\u2019t bring Mia back. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive Lexi Baill. I wish I could. Maybe justice will help me. At the very least, maybe it will send a message to the next kid who thinks it\u2019s okay to drive home from a party.\u201d She walked back to her seat and sat down, trying not to notice Miles\u2019s obvious disappointment in her.</p><p>\u201cMs. Lange?\u201d the judge said.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s aunt walked slowly to the podium. Instead of looking at the gallery, she looked at the bench. \u201cI am not an educated woman, Your Honor, but I know that justice and revenge are two different things. Lexi is a good girl who made a bad choice. I am proud of her for standing here and admitting that. I beg you to be merciful in sentencing. She has a lot of good she can do in this life. And I am afraid of what prison will do to her.\u201d Eva composed herself and then returned to her seat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The judge looked up. \u201cAnyone else?\u201d</p><p>Jude felt Zach shift in his seat, and then, slowly, he stood.</p><p>A gasp moved through the gallery. Jude knew what they saw when they looked at Zach: his burns, the newly shaved head, the discolored skin around his eyes, but mostly those who knew him saw his sadness. The boy who used to smile was gone. In his place stood this paler, injured version of her son.</p><p>\u201cZachary?\u201d the judge said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all her fault,\u201d he said without going to the podium. \u201cI was the designated driver that night. I was the one who\u2019d said I wouldn\u2019t drink. But I did anyway. I did. If she hadn\u2019t driven, I would have. I should go to prison instead of her.\u201d</p><p>He sat back down.</p><p>\u201cPlease stand, Ms. Baill,\u201d the judge said. \u201cTeen drinking and driving is an epidemic in this country. Toxicology reports confirm that you were intoxicated when you decided to get behind the wheel of a car. At the end of the night, a girl was dead and a community and a family are left to grieve.\u201d He looked at Zach. \u201cOthers might share moral responsibility for this tragedy, but the legal responsibility for this crime is yours alone. Obviously, no amount of prison time can make up for Mia\u2019s bright light or bring solace to the Farraday family. But I can make sure that other teens see this case and understand the risk they take when they drink and drive. I sentence you to sixty-five months in the women\u2019s correctional facility in Purdy.\u201d</p><p>And the gavel fell.</p><p>Lexi heard her aunt cry out.</p> <p>Guards moved toward Lexi; one pulled her arms behind her and clamped handcuffs around her wrists. She felt her aunt\u2019s arms come around her. Lexi couldn\u2019t hug her back, and, after all that had happened in the last weeks, that was when it really sunk in.</p><p>For the first time, she was really, truly afraid. All she\u2019d thought about was her soul and atonement, but what about her body? How would it be to spend more than five years behind bars?</p><p>\u201cOh, Lexi,\u201d Eva said, tearing up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took me in,\u201d Lexi said. Even now, with all that was happening, that sentence meant so much. Lexi found it hard to say more. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you waste your savings on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget what you did for me.\u201d</p> <p>Eva started to cry in earnest. \u201cBe strong,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll visit as often as I can. I\u2019ll write to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d the guard said, and Lexi felt herself being pulled away, led out of the courtroom and down a long hallway and up two sets of stairs. Finally, they put her in a room that was about ten by ten, with cement walls; no window; a metal, seatless toilet; and a metal bench. The place smelled of urine and sweat and dried vomit.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to sit down, so she stood there, waiting.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait long. Soon, the guards came back for her, talking to one another about something that had happened at lunch as they led her out of the back of the courthouse to a waiting police car.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking you directly to Purdy,\u201d one of the guards said.</p><p>Purdy. The Washington Corrections Center for Women.</p><p>Lexi nodded and said nothing.</p><p>The guard shackled her ankles and snapped her handcuffed wrists to the chain around her waist.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She hobbled along behind him, her head hung low. In the police car, she was buckled into the backseat. The chains around her waist bit into her back, so that she had to sit forward, with her nose almost pressed against the grill that protected the officers in the front seat. As they drove to the corner, they came to a stoplight.</p><p>In front of them, the Farradays were crossing the street; they looked like paper-doll versions of themselves, thin and fragile and bent. Zach was in the back, alone, his shoulders slumped downward, his chin dropped. From this side, his shaved head and burned jaw turned him into someone she hardly recognized.</p><p>Then the light changed, and they drove away.</p><p>Purdy prison was a monolithic slab of gray concrete set behind a wall of razor-wire fencing. All around it were green trees and blue skies. The surrounding beauty only served to make the prison look darker and more menacing.</p><p>As she moved toward this life she\u2019d never imagined, Lexi wished suddenly, fervently, that she had pled not guilty as her lawyer had suggested.</p><p>Inside the prison, they put her in a big cage. Crouched inside like an animal, she could see some of the prison. Bars of steel and walls of Plexiglas and women in khaki gathered in groups.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes and tried to make it all go away.</p><p>Finally, a guard came to get her, unlocked the cage, and herded her forward. She stood numbly beside him as he pressed her fingers onto an inked pad and rolled her prints onto paper. They positioned her in front of a camera, snapped a picture. Then someone yelled next! and she was moving again, shuffling forward into the loud, pulsing, clanging heart of the prison.</p><p>The guard led her into a room. \u201cShe\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>Two female guards came forward. \u201cStrip,\u201d one said, resting a plump hand on the walkie-talkie on her belt.</p><p>\u201cH-here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do it for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Lexi\u2019s hands were shaking as she unhooked her belt and pulled it free from the loops.</p><p>The guard took the belt from her, coiling it in her hands as if it were a weapon.</p><p>Swallowing hard, Lexi unbuttoned her pants and stepped out of them. Then she kicked off her black flats and unbuttoned her white shirt. It took every scrap of bravery she possessed to reach behind her back to unhook her bra.</p><p>When she was naked, the heavier of the two guards came forward. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Lexi followed one humiliating instruction after another. She opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue, lifted her breasts, coughed, wiggled her fingers, turned around and bent over.</p><p>\u201cOpen your cheeks.\u201d</p><p>She reached back and held her butt cheeks open.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Inmate Baill,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>Lexi straightened slowly and turned to the guard again. She couldn\u2019t look the woman in the eyes, so she stared at the dirty floor.</p><p>The guard handed her a stack of clothes: a pair of scuffed white tennis shoes, khaki pants and shirt, a used white bra, and two pairs of discolored underwear.</p><p>Lexi dressed as quickly as possible. The bra didn\u2019t fit right and the underwear itched and she needed socks, but of course she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cBe careful who you hang around with, Baill,\u201d the guard said in a voice that didn\u2019t match her gruff exterior.</p><p>Lexi had no idea what to say to that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d the guard said, indicating the door.</p><p>Lexi followed the woman out of the reception area and into the prison again, where the noise and the pounding and the catcalls seemed deafening. She kept her eyes downcast and followed, feeling the floor literally shaking beneath her feet from the hundreds of women stomping on the cell block before her.</p><p>Finally, they came to her cell, an eight-by-ten block of space hemmed on three sides by concrete walls and on the fourth by a solid metal door that had a small window, probably so the guards could look inside. The cell had two bunks with thin mattresses, a toilet, a sink, and a small desk. On the lower bunk sat a scrawny white girl with a cross tattooed on her throat. At Lexi\u2019s entrance, she looked up from her magazine.</p><p>The door clanged shut behind Lexi, but she could still hear the stomping and the catcalling going on in the cell block. She crossed her arms across her chest and stood there, shaking.</p><p>\u201cI got the bottom bunk,\u201d the girl said; her teeth were brown and ruined.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>Lexi saw now how young her cellmate was. The lines in her face and the circles under her eyes aged her, but Cassandra probably wasn\u2019t much past twenty-three. \u201cI\u2019m Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is receiving. We won\u2019t be cellmates for long. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know anything. She stood there a minute longer, then she climbed up onto her rickety bunk that smelled of other women\u2019s sweat. Lying on the coarse gray blanket, staring at the dirty gray ceiling, she couldn\u2019t help thinking of her mother, of that one terrible prison visit.</p><p>Here I am, Mom. Just like you after all.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Before the accident, Jude would have said she could handle anything, but grief had overwhelmed her. Intellectually, she knew it had to be dealt with somehow, and yet she couldn\u2019t imagine how to accomplish such a thing. She was like a swimmer in deep water who saw a great white approaching. Her mind screamed swim, but her body just hung there, paralyzed.</p><p>To everyone else, the so-called trial had been the end of the story. Justice was served; now go back to your regularly scheduled program. Jude had felt pressure from everywhere to heal now.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d gone gray. It was the only way to describe her life. A depression unlike anything she\u2019d ever known or imagined descended. She could find nothing to look forward to, nothing to do.</p><p>One by one, in the past six weeks, people had given up on her. She knew she\u2019d disappointed her friends and family, but she couldn\u2019t care about it. Her feelings were either gone or buried in such a dense fog that they eluded her. Oh, sometimes she was normal\u2014she might go to the store or drop something off at the post office, but she was always at risk of finding herself standing somewhere, in front of a row of plump purple eggplants or holding a letter, with no memory of how she\u2019d gotten there or what she needed. She\u2019d gone to the store twice in her pajamas, and once she\u2019d worn shoes that didn\u2019t match. The simplest tasks loomed like Mount Everest. Making dinner was beyond her.</p><p>She cried at the drop of a hat and screamed out for her daughter in her sleep.</p><p>Miles had gone back to work, as if it were completely normal to live with a frozen heart. She knew how much he was still hurting, and she ached for him, but he was already growing impatient with her. Zach hardly came out of his room. He\u2019d spent the summer in his new gaming chair, with his headphones on, killing animated enemies.</p><p>They were doing their best, Zach and Miles, and they didn\u2019t understand why Jude couldn\u2019t pretend, why she couldn\u2019t go out for lunch with her friends or work in her garden. Something. She saw how Miles looked at her in the evenings, over a dinner he\u2019d brought home in Styrofoam containers. He would say things like, \u201cHow are you today, honey?\u201d What he really meant was, \u201cWhen are you going to get over this and come back to me?\u201d</p><p>He thought that was the endgame. For him, the memory of their daughter was already becoming a treasured family heirloom that you put on a high shelf, behind a case of glass, and took down once or twice a year, at birthdays or Christmas. You couldn\u2019t handle it too roughly or too often for fear it would break.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like that for her. She saw blank spaces everywhere\u2014in an unused chair at the dinner table, in teen magazines that came addressed to Mia Farraday, in clothes left in a hamper. Mostly, she saw Mia in Zach, and it was unbearable. On good days, she could smile at her son, but there were so few good days; and on black days, when she couldn\u2019t get out of bed, she lay there thinking what a shitty mother she\u2019d become. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the middle of August, she\u2019d stopped doing almost everything. She had to remind herself to shower and wash her hair. The only time she even got out of bed was to welcome her husband home, and she saw the sadness in Miles\u2019s eyes when he looked at her then.</p><p>She knew she was depressed. Miles kept asking her to \u201csee someone.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand how deep this new darkness in her ran and how afraid she was to let go of it. She didn\u2019t want to get better. Really, she just wanted to be left alone. On the rare day when she even thought about trying, she told herself that Zach needed her, that Miles needed her, that she\u2019d always thought of herself as a strong woman, but the words were like snapshots found in a drawer that showed a stranger\u2019s life. Impossible to care about.</p><p>Now, she and Miles were out on the back patio, pretending to be the couple they\u2019d been before.</p><p>Miles was in the lounge chair beside her, with his feet stretched out. In his lap lay an open newspaper, but she knew he wasn\u2019t really reading it. They all tended to avoid the news these days; there was always a story about drunk driving somewhere within the pages. She felt him looking at her, but she didn\u2019t meet his gaze.</p> <p>Instead, she counted the minutes until she could make some excuse and go back to bed. She was holding Mia\u2019s unset, unfinished ring in her hand. She did that a lot lately, just held it.</p><p>\u201cYou should put that away,\u201d Miles said. There was a taint of irritation in his voice that had become familiar.</p><p>\u201cAnd go on,\u201d Jude said. \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t continue,\u201d he said, raising his voice.</p><p>She was startled by the volume. \u201cSave your surgeon voice for people who work for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting it drown you. Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt.\u201d She finally turned to him. \u201cOur daughter\u2019s death. So what, I\u2019m overreacting? How disappointing for you.\u201d</p><p>Miles tightened his jaw. \u201cEnough. I\u2019m not going to let you turn me into the bad guy who didn\u2019t love Mia enough because I can still somehow love my son and my wife. You need help. You need to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart what? Forgetting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetting go. It\u2019s not healthy to keep hanging on to her. Zach needs you. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there it is. The real point. You miss your wife, so I better toe the line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, Jude, you know that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to lose us.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere deep inside, she felt the sting of that, and the truth of it. She experienced a rare desire to explain, to try to make him understand. \u201cI went to Safeway last night. At midnight. I thought no one would be there. And I was right. I wandered around the aisles, just looking at stuff. When I ended up at the check stand, I had four tomatoes and ten boxes of Lucky Charms. The cashier said, \u2018Wow, you must have a lot of kids.\u2019 I stared at her and thought, How many kids do I have? What do I say to people? One, two. One now? I ran out without paying. You\u2019re right. I need help. How about if I get some of it from you and you just back off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to back off. I\u2019m scared as hell you\u2019re going to fill up your pockets with rocks and walk out into the water one day, like that stupid movie we saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? See?\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cAll right, Jude. You want my help? I\u2019m going to give it to you. I\u2019m going to get us started.\u201d He walked toward the sliding pocket doors and went into the house.</p><p>She let out a relieved sigh and sank back into the chair. That was how all of their conversations seemed to go lately. Miles storming off or walking away or trying to cure her with a hug. None of it meant much to her.</p><p>She stared down at Mia\u2019s stoneless ring, seeing the way the sunlight glanced off the prongs.</p><p>Then it hit her.</p> <p>She knew what Miles was going to do to \u201chelp\u201d her. It was something he\u2019d mentioned often. You can\u2019t keep putting it off, he\u2019d say. As if grief were a train that needed to stay on schedule.</p><p>With a cry, she flew out of her chair and ran up the stairs.</p><p>Mia\u2019s door was open.</p><p>She stumbled to a stop, frozen. She hadn\u2019t been able to touch the doorknob since that terrible night. She\u2019d kept the door closed, as if not seeing the pink room would diminish her pain somehow.</p><p>But now Miles was in there, probably starting to box up her things.</p><p>To give to other kids, Jude. Children in need. Mia would want that.</p><p>She shrieked his name and ran for the open door, ready to scream at him, grab at him, claw at him.</p><p>He was kneeling on the wheat-colored carpet, his head bowed, clutching the soft pink stuffed puppy that had once been their daughter\u2019s second-best friend in the world, next to her brother. \u201cDaisy Doggy,\u201d he said thickly.</p><p>Jude remembered with a stunning clarity how much she loved this man and how much she needed him. She tried to think of what to say to him now, but before she found her voice, Zach came up beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the\u2014\u201d He saw his dad, holding Daisy Doggy, crying, and Zach started to back up.</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d Miles said, wiping his eyes, but Zach was already gone. Down the hall, a door slammed shut.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re losing him,\u201d Miles said quietly. Slowly, as if his arm didn\u2019t quite work right, he put down the stuffed puppy.</p><p>Jude heard the censure that had crept back into his voice, the blame he placed on her, and she felt weighed down by it. \u201cWe\u2019re all lost, Miles,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t get that.\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer that, she went back downstairs and crawled into bed.</p><p>Lexi knew now why her lawyer had wanted her to plead not guilty. Prison was a place where women beat one another up for a hand-rolled cigarette. You had to be careful every second. The wrong look at the wrong woman could literally get you killed.</p><p>She was afraid all of the time, and when she wasn\u2019t afraid, she was irritated. Her temporary cellmate, Cassandra, had turned out to be a crystal-meth addict who would do anything for drugs and moaned all night in her sleep. Lexi had spent the first four weeks dodging the big mean women who ran the drug trades. She spoke to no one.</p><p>Today, though, she had something to look forward to.</p><p>It was visiting day. Lexi knew it was wrong to make Eva come up all this way, and she wished she were strong enough to tell her not to come, but she couldn\u2019t. It was so damned lonely here. Eva\u2019s visits were the only good thing left in her life, the only hour all week to which she looked forward.</p><p>She spent all morning counting the minutes, listening to Cassandra puke in their lidless steel toilet. When the guard showed up to take Lexi to the visitors\u2019 room, she practically leaped up. Following instructions precisely, she made her way through the various doors, past the inspections, and into the big, windowed room where family and friends came to visit.</p><p>There, she found an empty table and sat down, tapping her foot nervously on the floor. Guards were stationed around the room, watching everything, but other than that, it almost looked like a school cafeteria.</p><p>Finally, Eva came through the door. She looked smaller and older, with her gray hair frizzing out around her pleated face. As always, she looked uncomfortable in here, out of place.</p><p>\u201cOver here, Aunt Eva!\u201d Lexi said, raising her hand as if she were a high school girl again.</p><p>Eva shuffled forward. At the table, she stopped suddenly and kind of collapsed into the chair. \u201cLord, help me,\u201d she said, pressing a hand to her chest. \u201cYou\u2019d think I was the criminal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t mean that. It was just an ordeal, getting in today. Something must be up. That\u2019s all. How are you?\u201d She reached across the table and patted Lexi\u2019s hand, smiling brightly. \u201cHow are you this week?\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t mean to grab her aunt\u2019s hands, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. It felt so good to touch someone. The depth of her need surprised her. She was so hungry for conversation, for connection, that she launched into a review of the book she\u2019d read this week, and she told Eva all about her job in the laundry. In turn, Eva told her about the summer sale at Walmart and the weather in Port George.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Lexi had run out of news that she really looked at her aunt, and that was when she saw the changes. It had only been two months since Lexi\u2019s incarceration, but these visits had already left marks on Eva\u2019s face. Her wrinkles were deeper, her lips thinner. She had to keep clearing her throat, as if it hurt to speak.</p><p>Once Lexi saw all of that, she couldn\u2019t unsee it. She understood all at once how selfish she\u2019d been to this woman who had never been anything but kind.</p><p>\u201cHave you started taking college courses yet?\u201d Eva asked, pushing the fuzzy hair out of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get a degree in here. Just like you planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ex-cons have a hard time getting into law school.\u201d Lexi slumped back in her chair, feeling defeated now, alone. She\u2019d been through this kind of thing before, back when she\u2019d been in the care of strangers. She\u2019d waited and waited to see her mom, only to be heartbroken again and again. Sometimes the only way to survive was to stop hoping. Stop waiting.</p><p>Eva had been there for Lexi in a way that no one else ever had. We\u2019re family, Eva had said to her on that day, so long ago now, when they\u2019d first come together, and it had become the truth.</p><p>Now it was Lexi\u2019s turn. If she didn\u2019t release Eva now, her aunt would stay here, connected to this terrible place by a string of uncomfortable visiting days. \u201cYou should go to Florida,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Eva stopped. Had she been saying something? \u201cWhat do you mean? I can\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi leaned forward, grasped Eva\u2019s hands across the table. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in here for more than five years. And I know how much you want to live with Barbara\u2014this rainy weather is so hard on your knees. You deserve to be happy, Eva. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Lexi swallowed hard. She knew what she had to do. Eva would have to be forced to let go. \u201cI won\u2019t see you again, Eva. It won\u2019t do you any good to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Alexa...\u201d</p><p>It was all in that softly spoken name\u2014the regret, the disappointment, the loss\u2014and it hurt to hear it; mostly it hurt to know that she was pushing away the only person in the world who loved her. But it was for Eva\u2019s own good.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that what love was supposed to be?</p><p>\u201cWhen I get out, I\u2019ll come to Florida,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you do this,\u201d Eva said, her eyes filling with tears.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t let you do this,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cGive me this, Eva. Please. Let me do this for you. It\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p><p>Eva sat there a long time. Then, finally, she wiped her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll write every week.\u201d</p><p>Lexi could only nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll send pictures.\u201d</p><p>They kept talking, both of them trying to say everything that was needed, building up a store of words that would keep them warm come winter. But finally, the time was over, and Eva got to her feet. She looked even older now, more tired. And Lexi knew she\u2019d done the right thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood-bye, Alexa,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>Lexi stood there, nodding. \u201cThanks for...\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>Eva pulled her into a hug and held on to her tightly. \u201cI love you, Alexa,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lexi was shaking when she drew back. \u201cI love you, too, Eva.\u201d</p> <p>Eva looked at her through shiny eyes. \u201cAnd you remember this: I knew your mama. You are nothing like her, you hear me? And don\u2019t you let this place change that.\u201d</p><p>And then she left.</p><p>Lexi stood there for as long as she could see her aunt. Finally, she left the visitors\u2019 room and returned to her cell. She hadn\u2019t been there for more than forty minutes when a guard came and stood in the open doorway.</p><p>\u201cBaill. Get your things.\u201d</p><p>Lexi scooped up her few belongings\u2014toiletries, letters, photographs\u2014and put them in a dented shoe box, then she followed the guard into the main section of the prison.</p> <p>All around her, women were stomping their feet and calling out to her. In the steel and concrete prison, the noise was thunderous. Lexi didn\u2019t look up, just kept her belongings pressed to her chest and her eyes downcast.</p><p>The guard stopped suddenly.</p><p>The cell door in front of them buzzed loudly, clicked, and opened.</p><p>The guard stepped aside. \u201cInside, Baill. This is your permanent cell.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stepped around the guard\u2019s bulky body and peered into the cell that would probably be her home for the next sixty-three months.</p><p>The cement walls were plastered with photographs and drawings and magazine ads. A heavyset woman sat on the lower bunk, her broad shoulders slumped forward, her thick, heavily tattooed arms resting on her bent knees. She had long, ropey strands of gray-black hair and dark skin. Moles dotted her cheeks, and tattoos curled around her throat.</p> <p>The door clanged shut behind her. \u201cI\u2019m Lexi,\u201d she said, having to clear her throat before she had enough confidence to add, \u201cBaill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTamica,\u201d the woman said, and Lexi was surprised by the pretty sound of her voice. \u201cHernandez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy kid\u2019s about your age,\u201d Tamica said, heaving her considerable bulk off the narrow bed. It was concrete and steel; no springs pinged at the movement. She moved forward, pointed to a tattered, worn photograph taped to the concrete-block wall. \u201cRosie. I was pregnant with her when I got in here. Didn\u2019t know it, though.\u201d Tamica crouched down by the toilet and rolled a cigarette. As she smoked, she exhaled into the vent on the wall. \u201cYou got any pictures?\u201d</p><p>Lexi put down her box of belongings and sat next to Tamica on the cold floor. She picked up a few photographs from the pile. \u201cThis is my Aunt Eva. And this is Zach.\u201d She stared down at his senior picture. She touched it all the time. Already it felt as if she were starting to forget him, and that terrified her. \u201cAnd this is Mia. The girl I ... killed.\u201d</p><p>Tamica took the picture of Mia, studied it. \u201cPretty girl. Rich?\u201d</p><p>Lexi frowned. \u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, ain\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Lexi wasn\u2019t quite sure how to answer that. The question seemed to imply facts that weren\u2019t quite true, or that she hadn\u2019t really seen before.</p><p>\u201cI killed my husband,\u201d Tamica said, indicating a picture on the wall.</p><p>\u201cSelf-defense,\u201d Lexi said. It was something you heard about a lot in here. She seemed to be the only guilty person in prison.</p><p>\u201cNah. Killed the fucker in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI been here so long now I can hardly remember the bad shit I done.\u201d Tamica put out the cigarette and hid the unsmoked half inside of her mattress. \u201cWell, I guess we might as well talk. Get to know each other.\u201d She looked at Lexi, and in those dark eyes, there was a sadness that made Lexi uncomfortable. \u201cWe got time, you and me. And I could use a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Tamica smiled slightly. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>On a Wednesday in late August, Zach emerged from his bedroom looking disheveled and a little disoriented. His short hair was dirty and spiky; his T-shirt had a big stain across the front.</p><p>Jude and Miles were in the great room, staring at the TV, though neither was watching. They hadn\u2019t spoken in more than an hour. When Zach walked into the room, Jude\u2019s heart ached at the sight of him. If she weren\u2019t so exhausted, she would have gone to him, maybe asked how he was, but she hadn\u2019t slept in weeks, and even the merest movements were beyond her. She\u2019d lost fifteen pounds this summer, and the loss left her looking skeletal and wan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to USC,\u201d he said without preamble.</p><p>Miles rose slowly. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this, Zach. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what she would want,\u201d Zach said, and with that, the air seemed to get sucked out of the room, leaving them all breathless.</p><p>Miles sank back to the sofa. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure?\u201d Zach said, his voice dull. \u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m doing, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jude stared at her son, seeing the salmony patch of new skin along his jaw. Blue veins in his cheeks looked like cracked lines in aged porcelain. He was this big, broad-shouldered kid who\u2019d been whittled down by grief. How could she tell him to stay here, in this airless, dead place? \u201cOkay,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>For the next few days, Jude made a herculean effort to act like her old self. She wasn\u2019t that woman, of course, but she wanted\u2014this one time\u2014to think about her son instead of her daughter. In the old days\u2014only months ago now, a lifetime\u2014she would have thrown a huge \u201cgood luck in college / going away\u201d party for her kids. Now, it took everything inside of her to invite a few friends over to say good-bye to Zach. Honestly, she didn\u2019t want to do even that, but Miles insisted.</p><p>On the big day, she took a shower and washed and dried her hair. When she looked in the mirror, she was surprised by the thin, fragile-looking face that stared back at her. Too many sleepless nights had left dark circles under her eyes, and even in this final week of August, after a long, hot summer, she was as pale as chalk.</p><p>She brought out her makeup kit and went to work, and by three o\u2019clock, when the doorbell rang, she looked almost like her old self.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d Miles said, coming up behind her. He slipped his arms around her waist and kissed the side of her neck. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, forcing a smile. In truth, she felt a fluttering of panic. The thought of people around her, of having to pretend she was okay, getting over it, moving on, made her hyperventilate.</p><p>Miles took her by the hand and led her down the hall to the front door.</p><p>Molly and Tim stood on the front porch; both were smiling just a little too brightly. They had come bearing food, with their kids in a group behind them. The freezer was already full of foil-wrapped food that people had brought after the accident. Jude couldn\u2019t look at any of it, couldn\u2019t eat a bite of it. Just the sight of foil made her queasy.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d Miles said, stepping aside to let them in. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Instead of welcoming them, Jude crossed her arms and glanced out at her garden.</p><p>Prickly, ugly weeds grew everywhere. Her once-beloved plants seemed to be climbing over one another in a rush to leave their confinement.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>Jude blinked and saw Molly standing beside her. Had she been talking? \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cSenior moment. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>Molly and Miles exchanged worried glances.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey,\u201d Molly said, putting an arm around her.</p><p>Jude let her friend sweep her up like a warm tide and carry her into the front room, where a Good luck, Zach banner hung across the mantel. Miles put music on the stereo, but at the first song\u2014Sheryl Crow singing \u201cThe First Cut Is the Deepest\u201d\u2014he snapped it off and turned on the television instead. The Seahawks were playing football.</p><p>One by one, Zach\u2019s friends filed into the house. They took up space, these boys and girls she\u2019d known for so long. She\u2019d been with most of them since kindergarten. She\u2019d fed them and driven them to and from events and even occasionally advised them. Now, like Zach, they were getting ready to leave the safety of the island and go off to college.</p><p>Minus one.</p><p>Miles came up beside Jude, touched her arm. \u201cIs he going to come down?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, and in his eyes she saw the same thought that dogged her: the old Zach would never have been late to his own party. \u201cHe said he would. I\u2019ll go get him,\u201d she said.</p><p>She nodded and left, realizing too late that she\u2019d just walked away from Molly. She should have excused herself.</p><p>Honestly, it was hard to remember things like that these days.</p><p>At Zach\u2019s closed door, she reached into her pocket\u2014always full now of aspirin\u2014and she chewed one. The terrible taste actually helped.</p><p>Then she knocked on the door.</p><p>There was no answer, so she knocked again, harder, and said, \u201cI\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>He was slumped in his gaming chair, wearing headphones and wielding a controller like a fighter pilot. On the TV screen in front of him, a remarkably realistic tank rolled down a barren hillside, gun blazing.</p><p>She touched his head, gave it a little scratch.</p><p>He leaned into her hand, and she wondered how long it had been since she\u2019d touched him. With that thought came the loss again, the grief and the guilt. \u201cWhat you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to beat this level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friends are here ... to say good-bye,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said.</p><p>They went downstairs together, saying nothing.</p><p>In the living room, there was a moment of silence as they entered, awkward and uncomfortable. How could this ever be a celebration, really? Then Zach\u2019s friends came up him, smiling uncertainly, talking quietly.</p><p>Jude stood back. She was trying like hell to stay present, to stay in this moment that mattered to her son, but it hurt so much. She should have expected it, should have known she couldn\u2019t celebrate Zach\u2019s journey to college\u2014to USC\u2014without also mourning the fact that he was going alone.</p><p>She stayed as long as she could, smiled more than she would have thought possible; she even cut the cake and asked Miles to make a toast, but long before the day turned to early evening, she slipped down the hallway and hid in her dark office.</p><p>How could she go to USC, say good-bye to her son and not be overwhelmed with grief? USC was Mia\u2019s school\u2014everyone knew that. Her bedroom walls were studded now with red and gold USC paraphernalia. The worst part (which she would never admit to anyone) was that she wanted him gone. Every time she looked at him, she broke all over again. Without him, she could just do nothing. Be nothing.</p><p>Feeling shaky, she went to the sofa and sat down. Suddenly she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide,\u201d someone said, and the lights came on.</p><p>Molly stood there, holding a plate of lemon bars. She took one look at Jude and rushed to the couch, sitting down beside her. \u201cBreathe, honey. In and out. In and out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Jude said when the panic subsided.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to set you off again, but your mother\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReason enough to hide out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to you anymore, Jude. But I\u2019m here. You know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it.\u201d</p><p>Molly\u2019s gaze was steady, worried. \u201cYou can call me anytime ... I know how hard it will be on you when Zach is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone.\u201d The word was like the flick of a knife. Zach was leaving. Mia was gone.</p><p>She forced a smile. The only way to stop a conversation like this was to pretend she was okay. \u201cYes. Well. I better go see my mother before she decides to redecorate.\u201d She reached for a lemon bar, which she had no intention of eating, but it was the polite thing to do. The normal thing.</p><p>The next day, she and Miles and Zach set off for the airport.</p> <p>It should have been a joyous occasion. Each of them tried to pretend. Miles made inane conversation and stupid jokes all the way to Sea-Tac.</p><p>On the airplane, they pretended not to notice the empty seat across from Miles. Before, they\u2019d always sat two and two. Now they filled up a row themselves. The three of them.</p><p>At the college, they walked around in the hot California sunshine, remarking on the beauty and elegance of the campus.</p><p>Throughout the weekend, grief, always elastic, stretched out and snapped back, surprising them with its force at the oddest times. Seeing a blond girl in a black vest ... seeing a girl in a pink sweater do a cartwheel on the grass, hearing Zach\u2019s roommate ask about sisters or brothers ...</p><p>But they made it through. On Sunday night, they had a last family dinner at Mastro\u2019s Steakhouse in Beverly Hills and then took Zach back to his dorm room. There, Jude saw the decorations on Zach\u2019s roommate\u2019s side\u2014posters and family pictures and a quilt made by the kid\u2019s mom. It occurred to her then, too late, that she should have shopped for Zach, filled this room with everything he would need to succeed at school. The old Jude would have moved him in with boxes and boxes ...</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Jude said, trying not to cry.</p> <p>\u201cCall your mother,\u201d Miles said gruffly. \u201cKeep in touch.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded and hugged his dad. When he drew back and looked at Jude, she saw the uncertainty and shame in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do well, Mom. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Jude pulled him into her arms and held him as tightly as she could. Her shame and guilt were almost unbearable. She wanted to tell him how much she loved him, but the words that had once come so easily were impossible to form now.</p><p>He held her for a long time, and then slowly they drew apart.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d Zach said quietly.</p><p>It all came down to that one word. Good-bye. Once you said it out loud, it was real.</p><p>\u201cBye, Zach,\u201d Jude said softly. She and Miles walked out of his dorm room, into the busy hallway. Behind them, his door quietly clicked shut.</p><p>Seventeen</p> <p>That fall, time seemed alternately to fly forward and to crawl. With Zach gone, the house was as quiet as a tomb. Miles worked longer hours than ever. Jude knew he was afraid to come home to her. He hated how far she\u2019d fallen into the gray.</p><p>But now it was November, Thanksgiving weekend, and Zach was home. She\u2019d promised Miles, and herself, that she would make a real effort for her son. She wanted that. At least her mind wanted it, and she was determined for once to act like a mother.</p><p>And so she had come up here, to the attic above the garage. She stood in front of the red and green boxes that contained their Christmas decorations.</p><p>What had she been thinking?</p><p>How could she hang three stockings on the mantel? Or hold the Life-Savers-and-white-yarn ornament Mia had made in kindergarten? How?</p><p>She turned her back on all of it and headed for the door. By the time she got back into the house, her hands were shaking and she was cold.</p><p>She never should have told Miles she\u2019d decorate, but the sadness in Zach\u2019s eyes had filled her with guilt. She\u2019d thought that decorating for Christmas might cheer him up. He\u2019d been so depressed all week. He claimed that school was going well, that he had great grades\u2014and even swore that med school was still his future, but he was so quiet that sometimes she forgot he was even home. He never answered his cell phone, and after a while it had stopped ringing.</p><p>She moved into the living room. Sunlight shone through the tall windows, gilding the wooden floors. Zach and Miles sat next to each other on the big, overstuffed sofa, both wielding controllers, while two ninjas kickboxed each other on the big flat-screen TV.</p><p>\u201cYou find the ornaments?\u201d Miles said, without looking up.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Miles sighed; lately he was always sighing. So was she, for that matter.</p><p>Their whole relationship seemed to be made of air, filled with nothing. She wanted to make him happy, but she couldn\u2019t find any way to say what he needed to hear.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and she was relieved. She hated guests, but anything was better than this retread conversation about who she used to be. \u201cAre we expecting anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. People don\u2019t drop by anymore,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s Drew or Greg,\u201d Jude said, steeling herself to see one of Zach\u2019s friends.</p><p>She went to the door and opened it.</p><p>A stranger stood there, holding a manila envelope.</p><p>No. Not a stranger, but she couldn\u2019t place his face. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Scot Jacobs. Alexa\u2014Lexi\u2014Baill\u2019s defense attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, Mr. Jacobs,\u201d Miles said, appearing beside Jude.</p><p>She felt herself being pushed aside. She heard the door shut. Feeling light-headed, she followed the men into the living room.</p><p>\u201cI came to speak to Zachary,\u201d the lawyer said, and, at his name, Zach put down the controller and stood. \u201cI have these papers from Lexi. She asked me to deliver them to you personally. She thought you would be home this weekend.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at Jude\u2014just Zach\u2014and offered the envelope. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>How long did she stand there, staring? She could feel the blood moving in her veins, pounding on the walls of her heart. A high-pitched scream filled her head.</p><p>No. She was making that sound. Was that really her? The anger she\u2019d spent months suppressing came roaring back. Zach was talking, saying something, but Jude didn\u2019t hear the words; she didn\u2019t care anyway.</p><p>\u201cGet out of this house,\u201d she said suddenly. Yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...\u201d Scot said.</p><p>\u201cSorry? Sorry? Your client kills my daughter, but that\u2019s not enough for her, is it? She\u2019s not done with us. Now she has to ruin my son\u2019s life, too. How do we even know Zach is the father? How far along is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Zach said sharply.</p><p>Miles looked shaken and pale, but the anger Jude felt was nowhere to be seen in his eyes. That pissed her off even more. She was always alone in her feelings lately, always wrong.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s five and a half months pregnant,\u201d Scot answered.</p><p>\u201cHow convenient. What is in the envelope? What does she want from Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are adoption papers, Mrs. Farraday, and I can tell you that Lexi did not come to this decision easily. If ... Zach doesn\u2019t want the baby, she\u2019s prepared to undergo the adoption process alone. She\u2019ll find a good family. She doesn\u2019t want her baby to be in foster care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Zach doesn\u2019t want the baby?\u201d Jude said, incredulous. \u201cHe\u2019s eighteen years old, for God\u2019s sake. He can\u2019t remember to wash his clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hated foster care,\u201d Zach said quietly.</p><p>Scot nodded. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want that for her baby.\u201d</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t make sense of all of this; there seemed to be some undercurrent pulling at her, swirling around her, but she couldn\u2019t see a ripple. \u201cWhere\u2019s a pen?\u201d Jude said tightly.</p><p>\u201cJudith,\u201d Miles said, using his reasonable voice, the one that meant she was being a bitch or a shrew or whatever. She couldn\u2019t care less. She was sick to death of his reasonableness. The pain in her heart was all consuming, unbearable. It took every scrap of control she possessed not to howl in agony. \u201cThis is our grandchild we\u2019re talking about. We can\u2019t be cavalier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m being cavalier?\u201d Jude stared at her husband, hating him as much as she\u2019d ever hated anyone. \u201cYou think it\u2019s not tearing me up inside? You think I haven\u2019t dreamed of my first grandchild? But not like this, Miles. A child by the girl who killed our Mia? No, I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Zach said loudly.</p><p>Jude had forgotten he was even there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zach. I know this is terrible, tragic, but you need to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I ever done anything but listen to you?\u201d he said.</p><p>She heard the anger in his voice and stepped back from it. \u201cW-what are you saying, Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my baby,\u201d Zach said firmly. \u201cMine and Lexi\u2019s. I can\u2019t just turn my back on that. How can you want me to?\u201d</p><p>Jude felt the floor beneath her open up, and suddenly she was falling. She saw his whole sad future in a flash: no college degree, no decent job, no falling in love with the right girl and starting fresh in life. At that, her last, desperate hope that he would someday climb out of this pit and learn to be happy again disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a dad,\u201d Zach said. \u201cI\u2019ll quit school and come home.\u201d</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t breathe. How could this be happening? \u201cZach,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cThink about your future\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done, Mom,\u201d he said. \u201cWill you guys help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll help,\u201d Miles said. \u201cYou can stay in school. We\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>Scot cleared his throat, and the three of them looked at him. \u201cLexi thought Zach would feel this way ... or maybe she hoped. Anyway, she has also had me draft custody papers. She\u2019s prepared to give Zach full custody. She\u2019s asked for only two things from you. She doesn\u2019t want her child to know that she\u2019s in prison. Ever. She actually suggested that you tell the baby she ... died.\u201d He paused, looked at Zach. \u201cAnd she wants to hand you the baby herself, Zach. Only to you. So you\u2019ll need to be at the hospital when she gives birth.\u201d</p><p>Jude turned sharply on her heels and walked away. In her bedroom, she took three\u2014no, four\u2014sleeping pills and crawled into bed. As she lay there, trembling, praying for the pills to work, she tried to think about a baby, this baby, her grandchild; she tried to picture a tiny version of Mia, with hair like corn silk and eyes like green marbles.</p><p>How could she look at a baby like that and ever feel anything but her own loss?</p><p>Lexi was in the prison cafeteria when the first labor pain hit. She grabbed Tamica\u2019s wrist, squeezing hard.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Lexi said when it was over. \u201cIs that what it\u2019s going to be like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse.\u201d Tamica led her across the crowded cafeteria to one of the guards positioned by the door. \u201cThe kid\u2019s going into labor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guard nodded, radioed the news to someone else, and then told them to go back to their cell. \u201cSomeone will come for you, Baill.\u201d</p><p>Lexi let herself be led down to her cell. There, she curled up on Tamica\u2019s lower bunk and made it through the rising pain. Tamica stroked her hair and told her silly stories about her life. Lexi tried to listen and be polite, but the pains were sharper and coming faster now.</p><p>\u201cI ... can\u2019t ... take ... it. How do women take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaill?\u201d</p> <p>She heard her name through this fog of pain; when the cramp ended, she looked up groggily.</p><p>Miriam Yungoh, the prison doctor, was there. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a baby who wants to come out and play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cGive me drugs.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Yungoh smiled. \u201cHow about if I examine you first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p> <p>Lexi hardly paid attention to all the things that happened next. It was probably just as well. There was the pelvic exam that any prisoner walking past the cell could see, the strip search in receiving (to make sure that she wasn\u2019t trying to sneak something out of the prison in her vagina\u2014ha!), and the reshackling of her wrists and ankles.</p><p>She didn\u2019t relax until she was lying in the gurney in the back of an ambulance, shackled to the bed\u2019s metal rails. \u201cCan Tamica come with me? Please? I want her at the hospital,\u201d Lexi said between pains.</p><p>No one answered her, and when the next pain hit, she forgot everything else. By the time she got to the hospital, her pains were coming so fast it was like being in the ring with a prizefighter. She was in a private hospital room, with guards stationed both inside and outside the room. She wanted to roll over or walk or even just sit up, but she couldn\u2019t do any of that. She was shackled to the guardrails of the bed on the left side. One ankle and one wrist. And they wouldn\u2019t give her drugs because it was too late for that. Whatever the hell that meant.</p><p>Another pain hit. The worst one yet. She screamed out, her belly tightening so hard she thought she was going to die.</p><p>When the pain abated, she tried to sit up and then spoke to the guard. \u201cGet a nurse or doctor in here, please. Something\u2019s wrong. I can tell. It hurts too much. Please.\u201d She was panting now, trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cMy job isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Lexi begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The guard looked at Lexi; her eyes narrowed. Lexi wondered what the woman saw: a murderer chained to a bed, or an eighteen-year-old girl, giving birth to a baby she\u2019d probably never know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check,\u201d the guard said and left the room.</p><p>Lexi fell back into the pillows. She tried to be strong, but she had never felt so alone. She needed Aunt Eva here, or Tamica, or Zach or Mia.</p><p>Another pain ripped through Lexi; she strained against the restraints, felt the cold metal bite into her wrist and ankle. Then it was over.</p><p>Sagging back into the pillows, she exhaled. Her whole body felt wrung out.</p><p>She touched her belly. She could feel her baby in there, wriggling, probably trying to find her way out of this pain. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, little girl. We\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to imagine the baby inside of her. For months now, as she\u2019d lain in her lonely prison bed, she\u2019d dreamed of this baby, and in her dreams it was always a girl.</p> <p>When the pain came again, she cried out, certain this time that her stomach was going to split open like that scene in Alien. She was still screaming when the doctor came into the room, with a nurse beside him.</p><p>\u201cChained to the bed? Where are we, medieval France? Uncuff her. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Doctor, but I can\u2019t do that,\u201d the guard said. To her credit, she actually looked sorry.</p><p>\u201cHello, Lexi. I\u2019m Dr. Farst,\u201d he said, coming to her bedside.</p><p>\u201cH-hi,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019m dying. Do they ever rip you in half?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cIt just feels that way. I\u2019m going to examine you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her gown aside and positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>\u201cCan you see her yet? Aagh\u2014\u201d Lexi arched up in pain again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Alexa, it looks like someone is ready to be born. When I say push, you bear down as hard as you can.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was so tired, she could hardly move. \u201cWhat does that mean, bear down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019re constipated and trying to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Alexa. Push.\u201d</p><p>Lexi strained and pushed and screamed. She lost track of how many times the doctor told her to stop and start and stop again. She hurt so badly she could hardly stand it, and she wished someone were beside her, telling her she was okay, that she was doing great. That was how it happened in the movies.</p><p>And then a baby cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl,\u201d the doctor said with a smile.</p><p>Lexi had never known before that a heart could take flight, but that was how she felt suddenly; the pain was gone\u2014already forgotten\u2014and angels were lifting her up. She saw the doctor hand the baby\u2014her baby\u2014to the nurse, and she couldn\u2019t help reaching out to hold her. One arm lifted; the other clanged against the restraint.</p><p>\u201cUncuff her wrist,\u201d the doctor said to the guard, pulling off his blue surgical cap. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dr. Farst turned to the guard. \u201cIn this room, I\u2019m God. Take off the cuff. Leave the ankle if you have to. That should keep society safe from this teenager.\u201d He walked over to the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d he said.</p><p>It meant he thought she had lots of time ahead of her, that someday she\u2019d be in a room like this, giving birth to a child that she would bring home and love. That someday she would nurse her own child.</p><p>She could have told him that he was wrong, that she wasn\u2019t young anymore and that dreams were ephemeral things, like balloons that, once loosed, disappeared into the sky above you. But he was so nice, and she was tired, and she didn\u2019t want to look truth in the face right now.</p><p>The nurse came up beside her, handed Lexi a tiny bundle wrapped in pink.</p><p>Her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone for a minute. I know ... there are people waiting.\u201d</p><p>There was an awkward moment when truth muscled its way into the room, and then the nurse and doctor left.</p><p>Lexi stared down at her baby in awe, mesmerized by her little pink face and her bow-shaped lips, by her muddy blue eyes that seemed to know secrets that Lexi hadn\u2019t yet learned. Lexi reached down and touched a grape-sized fist. \u201cI have so much to say to you, little girl, but you won\u2019t remember it. You won\u2019t remember me. But I\u2019ll remember you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi held her daughter close, gave her all the love she had inside of her, hoping to imprint her in a way that would last. \u201cLike geese,\u201d she whispered into the tiny, shell-pink ear, \u201ctheir babies imprint on the mama in the first sighting and never forget.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door. The guard answered, spoke to someone in the hallway outside, and then opened the door. Scot walked in. He was as rumpled as always, in a cheap wool suit and an out-of-date tie, but the look in his eyes was so caring and compassionate that she felt the start of panic. She instinctively tightened her hold on her baby.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lexi,\u201d he said. At the red mark on her wrist, he frowned. \u201cThey shackled you? Motherfu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Scot leaned down. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Lexi.\u201d At the words, his face seemed to kind of fall. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d she asked, and even with all the pain that she knew was coming, her heart skipped a beat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me sit up, would you, Scot?\u201d</p><p>He helped her get positioned, then drew back. \u201cYou sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice do I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give up full custody, that\u2019s for sure. When you get out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at her,\u201d Lexi said, staring down at this beautiful girl. \u201cShe\u2019ll be loved by them. She\u2019ll feel loved. She\u2019ll feel safe. She\u2019ll have all the things I can\u2019t give her. Believe me, Scot, she doesn\u2019t need a mother like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree, but it\u2019s your choice,\u201d Scot said. \u201cI\u2019ll send him in.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sat up straighter, and then he was there, in the doorway.</p><p>It hurt more than she\u2019d expected, more than the labor she\u2019d just suffered through. He stood tall, bigger than she remembered, his shoulders broader. Wheat-blond hair fell across his eyes, and she remembered how much he used to hate that, how she\u2019d laugh when she pushed it aside to see his eyes as he leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>She loved him so much. It wasn\u2019t only in her blood, the way she loved him; it was her blood. She didn\u2019t know if everyone else was right and her love for him would someday begin to fade like an old photograph; how could she know that? She only knew that her love for him was the very best of her and without it her heart would be empty.</p><p>He moved closer, looking uncertain.</p><p>She was glad her daughter was in her arms, because she would have touched him. She wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop herself.</p><p>Up close, she saw the scar along his jawline; the wrinkled skin was the same pink as their baby\u2019s face. Soon, maybe, it would be gone altogether or become too fine to see, but it was there now, a visible reminder of her crime.</p><p>\u201cHi, Zach,\u201d she said, hearing the tremble in her voice.</p><p>He drew in a breath, saying her name quietly, and there finally was the heartache. His voice reminded her of nights on the beach, of kisses that went on all night. Of dreams and futures.</p><p>\u201cShe looks just like Mia,\u201d he said, and, with that, the past was here with them again, crouched alongside this bundled-up bit of the future.</p><p>Lexi wanted to apologize, but she held back. There was no point anymore; those days were over. This was about something else. Someone else. \u201cI would name her Grace,\u201d Lexi said, wiping her eyes. \u201cIf it was up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her mother,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Her mother. Lexi didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to name ... I thought you liked Katya.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a breath at that: so, he remembered. It felt like a lifetime ago, that conversation of hope between two kids who thought that love was easy. They\u2019d been on their beach, spinning diaphanous dreams of the future. \u201cMy friend ... Tamica is a Catholic. She says when God forgives you, he grants you grace.\u201d She looked down at her daughter. \u201cGracie? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>The baby made a mewling sound, and Lexi started to cry. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, baby,\u201d she said, kissing the tiny pink lips.</p><p>Then she looked up at Zach. \u201cTell her I loved her enough to do what was best for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring her to visit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She kissed her daughter one last time, and then slowly, slowly handed her to Zach. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to grow up like I did. Keep her away from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took the small bundle in his arms. \u201cGrace,\u201d he said. \u201cGrace Mia Farraday.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt the pain of that. \u201cI love you, Gracie,\u201d she whispered, wishing she\u2019d kissed her daughter one more time before she handed her over. \u201cAnd Zach, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door. It was so loud it startled her.</p><p>\u201cThat will be my mom,\u201d Zach said. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d</p> <p>Lexi shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>He paused, moved his gaze from the baby to Lexi. \u201cI ruined everything,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t find her voice, not even to say good-bye to her daughter or the boy she loved.</p><p>Jude had tried to prepare for this day. She told herself this would be it, the start of a new Jude, and so when Zach came out of Lexi\u2019s hospital room, holding a pink-wrapped newborn, his eyes glazed with emotion, Jude felt hope rising within her, standing tall.</p><p>\u201cGrace Mia Farraday,\u201d Zach said.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Miles said, coming up beside his son, cupping the baby\u2019s small head in his long surgeon\u2019s hand.</p><p>Jude looked down into her granddaughter\u2019s small face, and time seemed to fall away.</p><p>For a second, she was a young mother herself, with a baby in each arm and Miles beside her.</p><p>Grace looked exactly like Mia.</p><p>The same bow-shaped lips and muddy blue eyes that would turn green, the same pointed chin and white-blond eyelashes. Jude drew back instinctively.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Zach said, looking up at her. \u201cDo you want to hold her?\u201d</p> <p>Jude started to shake. The cold in her heart radiated out to her fingers, and she wished she\u2019d brought a coat. \u201cOf course.\u201d She made herself smile and reach out, taking Mia\u2014no, Grace\u2014in her arms, holding her close.</p><p>Love her, she thought desperately, beginning to panic. Feel something.</p><p>But there was nothing. She stared down at her own granddaughter, this baby who looked enough like Mia to fool anyone, and Jude felt nothing at all.</p><p>Physically, Lexi healed quickly. Her boobs shrank back to their normal size, and her milk dried up. Within a month, a few pale silvery lines on her lower belly were the only evidence that she\u2019d ever had a child.</p><p>She felt as faded as those marks. Pregnancy had changed her. A girl named Alexa Baill had gone into that hospital, chained to a bed, and given birth to the most beautiful baby in the world. She\u2019d seen the boy she loved one last time. And then it was all gone, and an older, wiser Lexi had come back to Purdy.</p><p>Before, she\u2019d been fragile, even hopeful; she saw that now, the way you saw a missing fence post. The lack stood out. She\u2019d been damaged, broken by the terrible thing she\u2019d done, but she\u2019d believed in redemption, in the power of justice. She\u2019d thought that going to prison would be an atonement and that with atonement she could be forgiven.</p><p>What a crock.</p><p>Her lawyer had been right. She should have fought the charges, said she was sorry and young and stupid.</p> <p>Instead, she\u2019d done the right thing and been crushed. She\u2019d lost everything that mattered to her, but nothing hurt more than the loss of her child.</p><p>In the two months since Grace\u2019s birth, Lexi had tried to hold on to who she was, but the best parts of her were draining away. Day after day, she attempted to write letters to her daughter, and each new failure stripped away a piece of her, until now there was so little left she felt transparent. Especially today.</p><p>She was in the yard, sitting on a bench beneath a pale denim sky. Over to her left, some khaki-clad women were playing basketball. The trees outside the prison were in full, vibrant bloom. Every now and then a pink blossom floated over the skeletal mountain of razor wire and landed on the ground like an impossibly kept promise.</p><p>\u201cYou look like someone who could use a boost.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked up. The woman standing there had a carrot-colored crew cut and a blue kerchief tied around her shorn head. A snake tattoo peeked out from her collar. She was a stocky woman with powerful hands and skin that looked like someone had scrubbed at her cheeks with steel wool.</p><p>Lexi knew who this woman was. Everyone did. Her nickname, Smack, said it all.</p><p>Lexi got slowly to her feet. In all the time she\u2019d been here, she\u2019d never spoken to Smack. There was only one reason women befriended Smack, and once you started talking to her, you never stopped.</p><p>\u201cI can make your pain go away,\u201d Smack said.</p><p>Lexi knew it was wrong, dangerous to listen to that promise, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. This pain of hers was unbearable, especially today. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>Smack smiled slowly, revealing black, ugly teeth. Meth. Mouths like that were a dime a dozen in here. \u201cFor the first time? A sweet thing like you? I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get the hell away from her, Smack.\u201d</p><p>Lexi saw Tamica barreling this way like a mama grizzly bear. She put a paw-sized hand on Lexi\u2019s chest and pushed her aside hard. Lexi stumbled, almost fell. She regained her balance quickly and surged forward. \u201cThis is my business, Tamica. You can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Tamica went toe-to-toe with Smack. \u201cBack off or I\u2019ll take you apart like cheap-ass furniture.\u201d</p><p>Lexi pushed in between the women. \u201cI need it,\u201d she said to Tamica, almost pleading. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore. I don\u2019t want to feel anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold out your hand,\u201d Smack whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tamica said. \u201cI won\u2019t let you do this, hermana.\u201d</p><p>Lexi made a roaring, wailing sound of pure unadulterated pain and punched Tamica in the nose.</p><p>A whistle blew.</p><p>Smack slipped two pills into Lexi\u2019s hand and then ran so fast it was as if she\u2019d never been there.</p><p>\u201cYou crazy?\u201d Tamica said, stumbling back. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either. I never asked you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHermana,\u201d Tamica said, sighing. \u201cI know how much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? A year ago today I killed my best friend.\u201d</p><p>Two guards stepped in between them and pushed Lexi away from Tamica. \u201cBack up, Baill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell,\u201d Tamica said.</p><p>\u201cNice try, Hernandez,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cI saw the whole thing. Come on, Baill.\u201d</p><p>Lexi knew where they were taking her, knew and didn\u2019t care. Yesterday she would have said that nothing scared her more than going to The Hole, but now, on the anniversary of Mia\u2019s death, in a world where Lexi had had a child and lost her, it barely warranted a sigh.</p><p>They led her down one hallway after another, finally coming to a small, windowless room. When the door opened, Lexi got a whiff of urine and filth and she started to panic, to turn away.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d the guard nearest her said, giving her a shove inside. There was a rough steel-gray blanket on a metal bed. The mattress and pillow were made of old, misshapen rubber. The only opening in the door was the size of a TV remote. Food probably came through that slot three times a day.</p><p>Lexi stood in the darkness, shivering suddenly, although it wasn\u2019t cold. The stench of the cell was making her eyes water.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cLearn something.\u201d</p><p>The door clanged shut, and she was in the dark.</p><p>Lexi stood there, freezing already. She opened her palm. It was too dark to see the pills, but she felt them. She put them in her mouth and swallowed them without water. It took a while for them to take effect, but finally a calm settled over her. She closed her eyes and forgot all about Mia\u2019s off-key singing and Zach\u2019s promise of love and Grace\u2019s mewling baby sounds. She sat on the cell\u2019s rubber mattress staring at nothing, thinking nothing, feeling nothing, just passing through time that felt interminable.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>Though nothing can bring back the hour</p><p>of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;</p><p>We will grieve not; rather find</p><p>strength in what remains behind.</p><p>\u2014WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, ODE:</p><p>INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY</p><p>FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>2010</p><p>From a distance, the Farraday family appeared to have healed. Miles, the renowned surgeon, was back to doing what he did best, and if he spent too many hours in the OR, it seemed right that he should save as many lives as he could. Zach had surprised everyone who knew him by blistering through both junior college and the University of Washington; he\u2019d graduated in three years and started medical school a year early. Now he was in his second year, and his grades were stellar. He had moved into a rental house on the island, and he did two things in his life: school and fatherhood. He seemed not to care that he had no time for a social life. Islanders spoke of him with pride, saying how tragedy had shaped him, and how well he\u2019d risen to the challenge of fatherhood.</p><p>And then there was Jude.</p><p>For years, she had tried to reclaim the woman she\u2019d been before her daughter\u2019s death. She\u2019d done what was asked of her, what was expected. She\u2019d gone to support groups and therapists. She\u2019d taken Xanax and Zoloft and Prozac at various times. She\u2019d slept too much and then too little. She\u2019d lost too much weight. Mostly, she\u2019d learned that some pain simply could neither be cured nor ignored nor healed.</p><p>Time hadn\u2019t healed her wounds. What a crock of shit that little clich\u00e9 was. The kind of thing lucky people said to those who were less fortunate. Those same lucky people thought that talking about grief helped, and they thought nothing of telling you to \u201ctry to get on with your life.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she\u2019d stopped expecting to feel better, and that was when she found a way to live. She couldn\u2019t control her grief or her life or much of anything, really (that was what she knew now), but she could control her emotions.</p><p>She was careful. Deliberate.</p><p>Brittle.</p><p>That most of all. She was like an antique porcelain vase that had been broken and painstakingly repaired. Every scar was visible up close, and only the gentlest touch could be used in handling the piece, but from a distance, from across the room, in the right light, it looked whole.</p><p>She followed a rigid routine; she\u2019d learned that a schedule could save her. A to-do list could be the framework for a life. Wake up. Shower. Make coffee. Pay bills. Go to the grocery store ... the post office ... the dry cleaners. Put gas in the car.</p><p>This was how she moved through the hours of every day. She cut and styled her hair even though she didn\u2019t care how she looked; she wore makeup; she dressed carefully. Otherwise, people would frown at her, lean closer, and say, \u201cHow are you, really?\u201d</p><p>Better to look healthy and keep moving. On most days, that worked for her. She woke up and made it through the interminable daylight. On weekdays, she fed her granddaughter breakfast and drove her to kindergarten. A few hours later, she picked Grace up from the elementary school and dropped her off at the afternoon day care program that allowed Zach to spend his days in medical school.</p><p>Jude had learned that if she focused on the minutiae of life, she could keep her grief at bay.</p><p>Most days, anyway. Today, though, no amount of pretending could protect her.</p><p>Tomorrow was the sixth anniversary of Mia\u2019s death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jude stood in her designer kitchen, staring at the six-burner stove. Late-afternoon sunlight slanted through the window, made the tiny bronze flecks in the granite countertop sparkle.</p><p>Miles came up beside her and kissed her cheek. He had stayed close to Jude all day. \u201cZach and Grace will be here for dinner,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She nodded. It occurred to her a moment too late that she could have turned into his arms and kissed him back, but as with so many things, her timing was off. She watched him move away from her, saw the distance between them expanding. It was a skill she\u2019d acquired; she actually saw empty space now.</p><p>She knew he was disappointed in her, in their marriage, just as she knew that he still loved her. At least he wanted to, and for Miles desire and reality were the same thing because he made it so. He still believed in them. He woke every day and thought today: today would be the day she\u2019d remember how to love him again.</p> <p>She went to the fridge for ground beef and pork and set about the comforting task of making meatballs. For the the next hour, she lost herself in routine: dicing vegetables, forming meatballs, frying them up. By the time her sauce was made, the house smelled of red-wine-based tomato sauce and savory thyme-rich meatballs. A humid sweetness hung in the air as water boiled on the stove. She turned the sauce down to simmer and made a salad. She was just closing the refrigerator door when she heard a car drive up.</p><p>She tucked the hair behind her ear, feeling the coarse new strands of gray that threaded through the blond\u2014tactile reminders of her loss. As she neared the living room, Miles saw her coming and met her halfway, putting an arm around her waist.</p><p>Grace walked into the sunlit entry. In her butterfly-print capri pants and smocked pink blouse, with her corn-silk blond hair fighting its way out of a lopsided ponytail, she looked like a little wood sprite. It wasn\u2019t until you studied her small, heart-shaped face, with its pointed chin and sharp nose, that you saw that there was nothing truly elfin about the serious child in front of you. Like the rest of them, she rarely smiled and laughed quietly, covering her mouth with her hand as if the sound were unpleasant.</p><p>Miles released his hold on Jude and went to his granddaughter, scooping her up in his arms and twirling her around. \u201cAnd how\u2019s my little Poppet today?\u201d</p><p>Jude flinched at the endearment. She\u2019d tried to stop her husband from using it, but he said he couldn\u2019t do it, that he looked at Grace and saw Mia, and the nickname slipped out.</p> <p>Jude saw Mia in Grace, too. That was the problem. Every time Jude looked at this child, the wound reopened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Papa,\u201d she said. \u201cI found an arrowhead on the beach at recess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Zach said, kicking the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cI could have,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t. Jacob Moore found it, and you punched him in the nose when he wouldn\u2019t give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacob Moore?\u201d Miles said, peering down at his granddaughter through the rimless glasses he now wore. \u201cIsn\u2019t he the kid who looks like Bigfoot?\u201d</p> <p>Grace giggled and covered her mouth, nodding. \u201cHe\u2019s seven,\u201d she whispered solemnly. \u201cAnd in kindergarten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her, Dad,\u201d Zach said, tossing his keys on the table by the door. \u201cShe\u2019s already looking at cage fighting as her only career option.\u201d He hung up his backpack, pausing for a second at the green sweater still hanging on the hall tree. His long fingers brushed the fabric. They all did that, touched the sweater like a talisman every time they came into the house. Then he turned away and headed toward the great room.</p><p>Jude was so removed from her own life that she saw her son from a distance even when he was right in front of her. His blond hair had grown out again; it was too long, messy and unkempt. His jawline was stubbly\u2014his beard grew in some places and not others because of the burn; his shirt was on inside out, and probably had been all day; and when he took off his sneakers, his socks didn\u2019t match. Worse than all of that was the exhaustion in his eyes. No doubt he\u2019d spent last night studying and still gotten up bright and early to make Grace breakfast. One day he was just going to drop where he stood.</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer?\u201d Miles said to his son as he kissed Grace\u2019s pink cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to drink beer,\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>\u201cVery funny, young lady. I was asking your daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Jude grabbed two beers from the fridge and poured herself a white wine; then she followed her men out to the patio.</p> <p>She sat down in the lounge chair by the barbeque. Miles was to her left, and Zach sat at the outdoor table, slumped in an armchair, with his stockinged feet planted up on the table. Grace walked past them and sat alone at the edge of the grass, where she started to talk to her own wrist.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still got her invisible friend, I see,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cOrdinary kids have invisible friends,\u201d Zach said. \u201cGrace has an invisible alien friend who is a princess trapped in a jar on her planet. And that\u2019s the least of our problems.\u201d He took a sip of beer and set the bottle aside. \u201cHer teacher says she has trouble making friends. She lies about everything, and she\u2019s ... started asking about her mother. She wants to know why she doesn\u2019t live with us and where she is.\u201d</p><p>Jude straightened in her chair.</p><p>\u201cShe needs us more,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should quit med school for a while,\u201d Zach said, and it was obvious from his voice and his body language that he\u2019d been considering this for some time. \u201cThird year is supposed to be wicked hard, and, honestly, I\u2019m jammed as it is. Every second of my life I\u2019m either studying or rushing to be with Grace. When I\u2019m with her, I\u2019m so tired I\u2019m useless. You know what she said to me last night? \u2018Daddy, I can take care of myself if you\u2019re too tired to make dinner.\u2019\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cShe\u2019s five years old, for God\u2019s sake. And she\u2019s worried about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re twenty-four,\u201d Miles said. \u201cYou\u2019re doing a hell of a job, Zach. We\u2019re proud of you, aren\u2019t we, Jude? You can\u2019t quit med school now. You\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I have study group at night. If I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll blow the final. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick her up and feed her dinner,\u201d Jude said. It was expected of her; she knew it. \u201cYou study as long as you need to.\u201d</p><p>Zach glanced over at her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t trust her with Grace; of course he didn\u2019t. He still remembered the early days when Jude had tried to be a grandparent and failed. Her grief had been knife sharp then: it stabbed at the strangest times and left her for dead. Because of it, she used to oversleep and forget to pick Grace up. Once\u2014the worst of times\u2014Miles had come home at night to find Grace lying forgotten in Mia\u2019s bedroom, in a dirty diaper, while Jude lay curled in the fetal position on her own bed, sobbing, holding Mia\u2019s photo.</p><p>They all knew that Jude couldn\u2019t look at Grace without feeling an overwhelming grief. Everything Grace did reminded Jude of her loss, and so she kept her distance from her granddaughter. It shamed Jude and embarrassed her, this weakness, but there was no way she could fix it. She\u2019d tried. But in the past two years, she\u2019d gotten better. She picked Grace up regularly from both kindergarten and the day care she went to after school. It was only on the worst of days, when Jude fell into that gray world, that she crawled into bed and forgot everything she had to do and everyone around her. Especially her granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better now,\u201d she said to Zach. \u201cYou can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what tomorrow is,\u201d Jude cut him off before he could say what they all already knew: tomorrow would be a bad day for all of them. \u201cBut you can trust me this time.\u201d</p><p>It should have been raining. The landscape beyond her window should have been ominous and black, like ink spreading, with swollen charcoal skies and cobwebbed black leaves skidding across dirty sidewalks and crows gathered on telephone lines. A scene out of The Stand. Instead, the sixth anniversary of her daughter\u2019s death dawned bright and sunny, with the kind of cornflower-blue sky that turned Seattle into the prettiest city in the world. The Sound sparkled; Mount Rainier came out to play, its vivid white peak resplendent over the city\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Still, Jude felt cold. Freezing. All around her, tourists walked through the Pike Place Market, dressed in shorts and T-shirts, carrying cameras and eating food off sticks or out of greasy white bags. Long-haired musicians staked out the primo street corner locations, hammering away at their accordions or guitars or bongo drums. One even had a piano.</p><p>Jude wrapped the heavy cashmere scarf around her neck and resettled the purse on her shoulder. At the end of the market, a triangular patch of grass provided a resting spot for the homeless. A giant totem pole looked down on them.</p><p>She crossed the busy street and walked up a steep hill to a swizzle stick of a building that poked high into the clear blue sky.</p><p>\u201cMs. Farraday,\u201d the doorman said, tipping his ridiculous hat at her.</p><p>Unable today to smile, she nodded and walked past him. Waiting for the elevator, she tapped her foot on the tile floor and bit her lip. She took off her scarf and put it back on. By the time she reached Dr. Bloom\u2019s austere glass-walled office, she was so cold she expected to see her own breath.</p><p>\u201cYou can go in, Ms. Farraday,\u201d the receptionist said at her entrance.</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t respond. She passed through the waiting area and went into Dr. Bloom\u2019s elegantly decorated office. \u201cTurn on the heat,\u201d she said without preamble, collapsing onto the plush chair beside her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a throw beside you,\u201d her doctor said.</p><p>Jude reached down for the camel-colored mohair blanket and covered herself with it, shivering. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, realizing the doctor was staring at her.</p><p>Dr. Harriet Bloom took a seat opposite Jude. She was as austere as her office\u2014steel-gray hair, an angular face, and dark eyes that noticed everything. Today she was wearing a houndstooth sheath with black hose and fashionable black pumps.</p><p>When Jude had first folded under Miles\u2019s relentless pressure to \u201cget help\u201d and \u201csee someone,\u201d she\u2019d visited a string of psychiatrists and therapists and counselors. At first her sole criterion had been their ability to dispense prescription drugs. In time, she\u2019d weeded out the touchy-feely purveyors of hope and the idiots who told her boldly that someday she would smile again. The minute someone told her that time healed all wounds, she got up and left.</p><p>By 2005, only Harriet Bloom remained\u2014Harriet, who rarely smiled and whose demeanor hinted at a personal understanding of tragedy. And she could prescribe drugs.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jude said again, shivering.</p><p>\u201cWe both know what day it is.\u201d</p><p>Jude wanted to make a smart comeback, but she couldn\u2019t. All she could do was nod.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMiles held me, but I pushed him away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do anything to mark the anniversary?\u201d</p><p>The question made Jude angry, and anger was good, better than this free-falling despair. \u201cLike send balloons up to her? Or sit by that granite stone in the grass where her body is? Or maybe I should invite guests over and celebrate her life ... which is over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes people find comfort in such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, you don\u2019t want comfort.\u201d Harriet wrote something on her notepad. \u201cWhy do you keep coming to me? You control your feelings so tightly we can hardly make progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come to you for drugs. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, really?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTonight will be ... bad. I\u2019ll start remembering her, and I won\u2019t be able to stop. I\u2019ll think that Miles was wrong. That she could have gotten better, or that if I\u2019d kissed her she could have woken up like a Disney princess. I\u2019ll imagine that I should have tried mouth-to-mouth or pounded on her heart. Crazy things.\u201d Jude looked up. Tears blurred Dr. Bloom\u2019s sharp face, softened it. \u201cI\u2019ll take some sleeping pills, and then it will be tomorrow, and I\u2019ll be okay until Thanksgiving, and then Christmas, and then ... her birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at that. \u201cYeah. Not that he celebrates it anymore, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time your family celebrated anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer to that. We\u2019re pod people like in that body-snatcher movie. We only pretend to be real. But why are we rehashing all of this? I just want you to tell me how to get through today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never ask me about tomorrow. Why is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost patients want to learn how to live. They want me to make a map that they can follow to get them to a healthy future. You simply just want to survive each day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe-llo. I\u2019m not bipolar or schizophrenic or borderline. I\u2019m sad. My daughter died, and I\u2019m devastated. There\u2019s no getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way it is.\u201d Jude crossed her arms. \u201cLook, you\u2019ve helped me, if that\u2019s what this is about. Maybe you think I should be doing better by now, maybe you think six years is a long time. But it\u2019s not, not when your child died. And I am doing better. I grocery shop. I cook dinner. I go out with girlfriends. I make love to my husband. I vote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention either your son or your granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be an exhaustive list,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cAre you still stalking Grace?\u201d</p> <p>Jude pulled her scarf off. She was hot now, sweating, in fact, and the scarf was choking her. \u201cI don\u2019t stalk her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stand in the trees and watch her at that after-school program, but you won\u2019t hold her or play with her. What would you call it?\u201d</p><p>Jude started to unbutton her coat. \u201cMan, it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you held Grace? Or kissed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. It\u2019s an oven in here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn menopause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude,\u201d Harriet said with an irritating patience. \u201cYou refuse to love your granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jude said, finally looking up. \u201cI can\u2019t love her. There\u2019s a difference. I\u2019ve tried. Do you really think I haven\u2019t tried? But when I look at her, I feel ... nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Jude sighed. \u201cI get what you\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve done this dance for years. I tell you I can\u2019t feel, and you toss back that I don\u2019t want to. My brain is the boss. I get it. I do. The old me would have been certain you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the new you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe new me is living. That\u2019s enough. I don\u2019t burst into tears when I see pink anymore; I can start my car without crying; I can look at my son and not be angry at him. Sometimes I can look into his eyes without even thinking about Mia. I can pick my granddaughter up from school and give her a bath and read her a bedtime story, all without crying. You know how much progress this is. So can we just, for now, forget the next step and let me get through this day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could talk about Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jude said sharply. She\u2019d learned a long time ago that talking about Mia only sharpened the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk about her. You need to remember her and grieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do nothing but grieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your grief is an artery that\u2019s been clamped off. If you don\u2019t take that clamp off and let it flow, you\u2019ll never heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t heal,\u201d Jude said tiredly, leaning back into the sofa. \u201cBig surprise. How about if we talk about Miles? We made love last week. That\u2019s a good sign, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Harriet sighed and made a notation on her pad. \u201cYes, Jude. That\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>Every day after kindergarten was over, Grace went to the Silly Bear Day Care until Daddy got home from big-boy school.</p><p>On good days, like today, they all got to play outside, but Mrs. Skitter made them walk from the day care to the beach holding a scratchy yellow rope. Like they were babies.</p><p>As usual, Grace was at the very front of the line, right behind the teacher. She could hear the other kids laughing and talking and horsing around. She didn\u2019t join in; she just followed along behind, staring at the big pillows of her teacher\u2019s butt.</p><p>When they reached the beach park, Mrs. Skitter gathered the ten of them in a circle in front of her. \u201cYou know the rules. No going in the water. No fighting. Today we\u2019re going to play hopscotch in the sand. Who wants to help me make the squares?\u201d</p><p>Hands went up, kids started yelling, \u201cMe, me, me!\u201d and bouncing up and down. It reminded Grace of the baby birds she\u2019d seen at the newborns exhibit her dad had taken her to. Chirp, chirp.</p><p>She walked over to her usual spot. Everyone knew she liked it here. She sat on a log in the sand, way out of the waves\u2019 reach. Sometimes, if she was lucky, she saw a crab or a sand dollar. Mostly, she just talked to her best friend.</p><p>She stared down at the pink band she wore on her wrist. On its center, where there used to be a Minnie Mouse watch, her daddy had placed a small round mirror, about the size of her palm. It was the best present she\u2019d ever gotten. It had allowed her to leave her bedroom. Before the wrist mirror, she\u2019d spent hours standing in front of her bedroom mirror, talking to her friend, Ariel, who was a princess on another planet.</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t stupid. She knew that some of the other kids made fun of her for having an invisible friend, but she didn\u2019t care. The kids in her class were stupid anyway.</p><p>None of them knew how quiet this planet could be, so they hadn\u2019t learned to listen like she had. She was used to quiet. Her grandparents\u2019 house was like a library sometimes.</p><p>There was something wrong with Grace. She\u2019d known that her whole life, even if she didn\u2019t know what it was. People didn\u2019t like her, not even her grandma. Grace tried to be likable and nice and quiet, she really did, but none of it ever worked, and things just went wrong for her, no matter how hard she tried. She broke things and tripped over stuff and couldn\u2019t seem to learn her letters.</p><p>Hey, Gracerina, Ariel said.</p><p>Grace looked down at the circle of glass. She couldn\u2019t really see Ariel. It wasn\u2019t like that. She just knew her friend was there now, and she could hear the voice in her head.</p><p>Grown-ups always asked Grace how she knew when Ariel was around or what her best friend looked like. Grace told them Ariel looked exactly like Cinderella.</p><p>It was sort of true.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t actually see Ariel, but she knew when her best friend was in the mirror and when she was gone. And she did look like Cinderella. Grace would swear it.</p><p>She still remembered the first time Ariel had shown up.</p><p>Grace had been a baby, still in diapers. She\u2019d been home with Nana, who used to babysit sometimes when Daddy was busy with school. All Grace remembered about those days was the sound of Nana crying. Everything made Nana sad: the music on the radio, the color pink, the dumb old green sweater hanging in the entry, the closed door upstairs. And Grace.</p><p>Just looking at Grace made Nana cry.</p><p>One day, Grace had done something wrong. She didn\u2019t know what it was. All she knew was that one minute she was standing there with a stuffed pink puppy that she\u2019d found in her grandparents\u2019 room, and the next minute Nana was yanking the puppy out of her hands so hard Grace stumbled sideways and plopped onto her butt.</p><p>Nana burst into tears and so did Grace. She waited for her daddy, but no one came to get her, and finally she just sat there alone, sucking her thumb.</p><p>Then she\u2019d heard someone say her name.</p><p>Gracie, come here ... follow me ...</p><p>She\u2019d wiped her slimy nose and stood up. Holding her yellow blanket, she followed the voice up the stairs to the door that was always shut. No one ever played in this room.</p><p>Inside, it was like something out of a fairy tale, all pink and yellow and perfect.</p><p>Over by the dresser was a big mirror that was shaped sort of like a football, with a red and gold flag stuck into the hinge. A bunch of glittery gold stuff framed the oval mirror\u2014bracelets and metal flowers and sparkly rainbows.</p><p>Gracerina?</p><p>She remembered peering into the mirror, seeing a flash of yellow and smear of pink.</p><p>You okay?</p><p>Grace frowned, looked harder, seeing ... something. A girl, maybe, a little older than her. Are you okay? the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bad,\u201d Grace said, feeling tears start again. \u201cGrace bad.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re not bad.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m Ariel. I\u2019ll be your friend as long as you need me. Here, Gracerina. Lie down on the carpet, go to sleep. I could tell you a story.</p><p>Grace had been so tired. She\u2019d curled up on the soft carpet and pulled her blanket around her. Sucking her thumb, she\u2019d fallen asleep to the pretty sound of her new friend\u2019s voice. Since then, Ariel had been her bestest\u2014her only\u2014friend.</p><p>Why don\u2019t you go play with the other kids?</p><p>Grace looked down at her wrist. \u201cThey\u2019re stupid.\u201d She poked a stick into the sand at her feet.</p><p>Boy alert.</p><p>Grace sat up straighter and looked around. Sure enough, Austin Klimes was coming this way. His face was big and fat, like someone had konked him in the head with a pan. \u201cUh, you wanna come play hopscotch with us?\u201d he said, breathing heavily. His cheeks were flushed, too.</p><p>The teacher had made him come over here. Grace could see the other kids huddled together across the beach, watching her and giggling. They thought it was funny that no one liked her.</p><p>\u201cAriel isn\u2019t allowed to hopscotch.\u201d</p><p>Austin frowned. \u201cEveryone\u2019s allowed to play hopscotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fake friend isn\u2019t a princess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShows what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a big fat liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre too.\u201d He crossed his big arms across his chest.</p> <p>Calm down, Gracerina. He\u2019s just a bully.</p><p>\u201cYour only friend is invisible,\u201d Austin laughed.</p><p>Grace was on her feet before she could stop herself. \u201cYou take that back, lardo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s gonna make me, you? Or your invisible friend?\u201d</p><p>Grace punched him right in his piggy nose. He screamed like a baby and ran for the teacher.</p> <p>Oh, boy.</p><p>Grace watched the kids huddle around Austin. They turned to point at her and then huddled again. Mrs. Skitter led Austin over to the ice chest, where she kept all her teacher stuff. In no time at all, Austin must have been fine, because he ran off to play hopscotch.</p><p>Here she comes.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t need Ariel to tell her she was in trouble. She leaned forward and rested her arms on her thighs.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head up. Fine blond hair fell across her face. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMay I sit down?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you shouldn\u2019t have punched Austin in the nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And you\u2019re gonna have to tell his parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your dad.\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sent him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t wanna play with me. And I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone wants friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Ariel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been a good friend to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never makes fun of me.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Skitter nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve lived on this island a long time, Grace, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of kids come and go. I used to know your daddy, did I ever tell you that? I worked in the lunch room when he was in high school. Anyway, the point is, everyone makes friends sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cNot me. No one likes me. And I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings change, Gracie. You\u2019ll see.\u201d Mrs. Skitter sighed, put her hands on her thighs. \u201cWell, I was going to collect some beach stones. The pretty kind. You want to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not find any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you might.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Skitter stood up, put her hand out.</p><p>Grace stared at her teacher\u2019s white hand. A simple gold band on one finger meant she was married.</p><p>\u201cMy daddy\u2019s not married,\u201d she said impulsively.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cuz my mom is a super spy.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Skitter frowned seriously. \u201cReally? How exciting. You must miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But I\u2019m not s\u2019posed to.\u201d</p><p>For the next two hours, she followed Mrs. Skitter around, bent over, peering down at the rocks at her feet. One by one, the other kids went home, until finally it was only Grace and her teacher on the beach. Mrs. Skitter kept looking at her watch and making a tsking sound. Grace knew what that meant.</p><p>It was getting dark when Papa showed up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Gracie,\u201d her grandfather said, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cGrandma forgot me again,\u201d Grace said, letting the fistful of rocks tumble from her hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not feeling well. But I\u2019m here, and I thought I\u2019d take my best girl for ice cream.\u201d He bent down and scooped Grace into his arms. She clung to him, wrapping her legs around him like a little monkey.</p><p>He carried her over to Mrs. Skitter, and they said good-bye. Then he put her into the car seat in the back of Grandma\u2019s big black car.</p><p>\u201cYou have something to tell me,\u201d he said, starting the engine.</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d She looked up, saw her grandpa looking at her in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cThe fight with Austin Klimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Grace said, sighing. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re not supposed to hit other kids, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe started it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kicked sand in my face. And he said I was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he said a bad word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, Grace, you shouldn\u2019t be hitting kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you only said I couldn\u2019t hit girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, slumping in her seat. \u201cI won\u2019t hit Austin Klimes anymore, even if he\u2019s a butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that about Jacob Moore, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t hit Jake.\u201d</p><p>She could tell that Papa was trying not to smile. \u201cWe are not going through the kids in day care one by one. You can\u2019t hit any of them. And before you look for a loophole, no hitting kids in kindergarten, either. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a loophole? Is that like a hula hoop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Are you gonna tell my daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Grace felt truly bad about what she\u2019d done. Now her daddy would give her that disappointed look, and she\u2019d get scared and snuggle up to him and hope he wouldn\u2019t leave her. She didn\u2019t have a mommy. What would she do without a daddy?</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>\u201cScared? What do you mean, you\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><p>Lexi leaned against the gray wall of her cell. After seventy-one and a half months in prison, she was finally getting out. She\u2019d served her whole sentence\u2014and then some, thanks to bad choices\u2014so there would be no parole for her, no probation. She had a community service advocate who was prepared to help her \u201ctransition,\u201d but the truth was that in a few minutes, she\u2019d be just another citizen, free to go where she pleased. All she knew was that she was going to Florida to be with Eva; after that, her life stretched out like a desert highway with no end or turns in sight.</p><p>Strangely, now that the day was upon her, she was afraid to leave. This ten-foot square cell had become her world, and there was a safety in the familiarity of it. There were eight steps from the bed to the toilet; two from the sink to the wall; three from the bed to the door. The walls were covered with Tamica\u2019s family photos\u2014pictures of people that had become like family to Lexi. Her own pictures, of Aunt Eva and Zach and Mia, had been taken down years ago. Looking back was too painful, and a waste of time on top of it. She could never forget Mia\u2019s smile, with or without a reminder.</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d Tamica put down the tabloid magazine she was reading. \u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who I am in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to focus on whoever you became in here, hermana. Especially not you. You got so much life ahead of you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi looked down at her few belongings. On the end of the bed were her prized possessions, all that she\u2019d hoarded and collected in the past years: a shoe box full of letters\u2014from Aunt Eva and to Grace; Mia and Zach\u2019s senior pictures and a photograph of the three of them at a school dance; and a worn, often-read paperback copy of Wuthering Heights. No more Jane Eyre for her; why read about someone else\u2019s happy ending?</p><p>A guard appeared at the door. \u201cTime to go, Baill.\u201d</p><p>Tamica moved slowly off the bed. In the past few years, as Lexi had whittled her own body down to a runner\u2019s leanness, Tamica had packed on the pounds. She claimed menopause was the culprit, but prison food didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Lexi stared at the sad, dark face of the woman who had saved her in here, had been a friend when she desperately needed one; if Lexi still knew how to cry, she would have. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you,\u201d Lexi said, wrapping her arms around Tamica\u2019s broad, rounded back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll write to you,\u201d Lexi promised.</p><p>\u201cSend me a picture of you and Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTamica ... I gave up that right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Tamica grabbed her by the shoulders, shook her. \u201cYou know what I would give to be walking outta here with you? Don\u2019t you dare be JELL-O. You made a mistake and you paid for it. Period.\u201d She pulled Lexi into another hard embrace. \u201cSee your daughter, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Baill,\u201d the guard said.</p><p>Lexi let go of Tamica and walked over to the bed, where she gathered up her few belongings. She intended just to walk out, be as cool as possible, but she couldn\u2019t. At the door, she paused and turned back.</p><p>Tamica was crying. \u201cDon\u2019t you come back,\u201d she said, \u201cor I\u2019ll whoop your white ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Lexi promised.</p><p>As she carried her pathetic shoe box through the prison, women catcalled and yelled to her. She remembered how they had scared her at first, these women. She was one of them now, and she knew that no matter how long she lived or how much she changed, a part of her would be here, behind bars. Maybe a part of her always had been. A girl without a mother was a prisoner of a different kind.</p><p>At the desk, another uniformed guard handed her some paperwork and a bag with her own clothes in it, as well as a small manila envelope.</p><p>\u201cYou can change in there,\u201d the guard said, pointing to a door down the hall.</p><p>Lexi went inside the room and shut the door. Alone, she stripped out of her faded, worn prison khakis and secondhand underwear.</p><p>Inside the bag, she found the wrinkled black pants and white blouse she\u2019d worn to the courthouse so long ago, along with her own beige bra and black panties and a flattened patchwork denim purse. Black kneesocks and cheap black flats completed the old Lexi look. Or the young Lexi.</p><p>She dressed carefully, enjoying the feel of the soft cotton against her dry skin. The pants were too big for her now; they hung off her protruding hip bones. So was the bra. In her zeal to keep busy and get strong, she\u2019d spent long hours in the gym, and her body had turned almost freakishly sinewy. Her boobs had all but checked out.</p><p>She buttoned up the black pants and tucked her shirt into the baggy waistband before turning to the mirror. For years, she\u2019d imagined joy on this day, pictured it. But now, when she stared at her reflection, all she saw was a tired, stringy version of who she\u2019d been.</p><p>She looked like an adult. More than that even, she looked at least ten years older than she was, with her pale skin, her prominent cheekbones and colorless lips. Her black hair had been cut off a few years ago by the prison barber, who had taken all of seven minutes to chop off twelve inches of hair. The pixie cut had grown out into soft curls that framed her angular face.</p><p>She opened the yellow envelope and found an expired driver\u2019s license with a young girl\u2019s face on it, a half-empty package of gum, a cheap drugstore watch, and her promise ring from Zach.</p><p>A knock on the door roused her.</p><p>\u201cBaill. You okay?\u201d</p><p>She put everything, including the ring, in her purse, threw the bag and envelope in the wastebasket, and left the room.</p><p>At the prison office, she signed one document after another and took the two hundred dollars that was her exit money from the state. How a person was supposed to start a new life with two hundred bucks and no valid ID was beyond her.</p><p>She followed instructions and did as she was told, until she heard a door clang shut behind her and she was standing in the open air, beneath a bright late-afternoon sky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Free air.</p><p>She tilted her face to the sky, felt the day\u2019s warmth on her cheeks. She knew the van was waiting for her\u2014it would take her to the nearest bus station\u2014but she couldn\u2019t seem to make herself move. It felt amazingly good to just stand here, with no bars or razor wire defining her space and no women getting in her face. No\u2014</p><p>\u201cLexi?\u201d</p><p>Scot Jacobs walked up to her, smiling. He was older\u2014his hair was short now, conservative looking, and he wore glasses\u2014but other than that, he looked the same. He might even be wearing the same suit. \u201cI wanted someone to be waiting for you.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know how to process the gratitude she felt. After so many years of bottling emotions, it wasn\u2019t easy to open them. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, and she stared back, then he said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s go,\u201d and started walking toward his car.</p><p>She automatically fell into step behind him.</p><p>He stopped, waited for her to catch up.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled. She wasn\u2019t a prisoner anymore. \u201cOld habits, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>This time she walked next to him to the blue minivan parked in the lot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind the junk in the car,\u201d he said, opening the passenger door. \u201cIt\u2019s my wife\u2019s car, and she says she never knows what she\u2019s going to need, so she never takes anything out.\u201d</p><p>Lexi climbed up into the passenger seat and stared at the imposing gray of the prison.</p><p>She snapped her seatbelt into place. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice of you to pick me up, Mr. Jacobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Scot. Please,\u201d he said, pulling out onto the road and away from the prison.</p><p>She opened the window and stuck her head out, breathing in the sweet, clean air. The landscape was exactly as she remembered: towering trees, summer blue sky, distant mountains. Out here, life had gone on without her.</p> <p>\u201cI was sure bummed to hear they added time on to your sentence for bad behavior. I expected to pick you up a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. 2005 was a bad year. After I lost Gracie...\u201d She couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. All of that was behind her now, anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good as an ex-con can be. I don\u2019t do drugs or drink, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you got your degree. Your aunt was so proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSociology,\u201d Lexi said, turning her head to stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cStill dreaming of law school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still young, Lexi,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d She leaned more deeply into the comfortable seat, watching the miles fly past. Soon, they were in Port George, driving through the Native-owned land, past the fireworks stands that lined the road in early summer. And then they were on the bridge, crossing over Shallow Pass.</p><p>Welcome to Pine Island, pop. 7,120.</p><p>She felt her chest tighten. There was the entrance to LaRiviere Park ... the high school ... Night Road. By the time Scot pulled up in front of his office, Lexi\u2019s jaw ached.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Scot asked, opening her door.</p><p>Get out, Lexi. Smile. If there\u2019s one thing you know how to do now, it\u2019s fake a smile.</p><p>She managed it. \u201cThanks, Scot.\u201d</p><p>He handed her one hundred dollars. \u201cThis is from your aunt. And here\u2019s a bus ticket to Pompano Beach. The bus leaves tomorrow afternoon at 3:30.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>How was she supposed to keep her distance when she was here, at the scene of her crime and the only place that had ever felt like home?</p><p>\u201cJenny invited you to spend the night and have dinner with us if you\u2019d like,\u201d Scot said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She said it too quickly and realized her mistake. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, it\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t been around people for a long time. Two thousand one hundred forty-four and a half days.\u201d She smiled tiredly and looked around, anxious to be on her own.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask me?\u201d Scot said.</p><p>Lexi wanted to shake her head, maybe even say hell, no, but she just stood there.</p><p>\u201cShe lives with her dad in the old Tamarind cabin on Cove Road. I see her every now and then in town with her dad.\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t react. In prison, she\u2019d learned to hide everything, especially pain. \u201cDoes she look happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks healthy.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Well, Scot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could fight for her, Lexi. Partial custody or at least visitation rights.\u201d</p><p>Lexi remembered \u201cvisitations\u201d with her mom: the two of them in a room while a social worker looked on. What Lexi remembered about those rare days was how scared she was of the woman who\u2019d borne her. \u201cI\u2019m a twenty-four-year-old ex-con whose last real job was part-time at an ice cream shop. I have no place to live, and I doubt like hell I\u2019ll be hired at any decent job. But I should swoop in and see my daughter, wedge myself into the Farraday family again, and bring up all that pain ... so that I can feel happier. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be like my mother. I won\u2019t make any decision that isn\u2019t in my daughter\u2019s best interest. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to Florida tomorrow. Grace deserves better than me, and if I\u2019m around she\u2019ll love me anyway. That\u2019s what kids do: they love loser parents, and it breaks their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a loser. And what\u2019s wrong with her loving you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Scot pursed his lips. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a set of keys and extracted one. \u201cThis is the key to my office. There\u2019s a sofa bed in the conference room and a bike by the front door. The combination is 1321. We closed up early today, so the place is all yours.\u201d</p><p>She took the key and pocketed it. \u201cThank you, Scot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I believe in you, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She should have walked away then, said nothing more. That was what she meant to do; instead, she found herself looking up at him, saying, \u201cDid Zach get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s still in school, I think. No wife. He lived with his parents for a few years and then moved into that cabin on the cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never wrote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times. I sent all the letters back unopened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lexi,\u201d Scot said, sighing. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms, trying not to remember the feel of those letters in her fingers, the sight of them on the rough gray wool of her blanket. But she\u2019d been so angry then, so wounded. She\u2019d acted out in all kinds of terrible ways. By the time she was past all of that, stronger, it was too late. He never wrote again, and she hadn\u2019t had the courage to write to him.</p><p>\u201cI should have taken your advice,\u201d Lexi finally said, unable to look at Scot as she said it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. Thanks again. I think I\u2019ll go for a bike ride. It\u2019s a beautiful day.\u201d</p><p>Scot went over to the front door of his office, got the bike, and guided it back to her.</p><p>She wanted to tell him how much it had meant to her, his being there today. For years she\u2019d prepared to be all alone when she got out of prison, and she saw now how painful that would have been.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She nodded one last time and took the bike from him and rode away.</p><p>Soon she was smiling in spite of herself. It felt so good to be free, to turn when she felt like it and go where she wanted. She would never take this for granted.</p><p>She spun by the theater\u2014saw that they\u2019d added on to it\u2014and the bank and the beauty salon where Aunt Eva had gotten her hair cut. There, she saw a pay phone. After a quick signal, she turned into the parking lot and called Eva, collect.</p><p>There was no answer.</p><p>Disappointed, she climbed back onto the bike and started pedaling.</p><p>The ice cream shop was still there; beside it was a new coffee shop and a computer repair place.</p><p>When she came to the high school, she slowed down. A big new gymnasium dominated the campus. It looked nothing like she remembered, except that the flagpole was still there and that was enough.</p><p>Meet me at the flagpole, by the admin building ...</p><p>She pedaled harder, down the bumpy asphalt road and up Raspberry Hill. Out here, there were occasional dirt roads and the odd mailbox, but mostly it was uninhabited. Sunset was nearing, and the sky was a deep midnight color, and before she knew it she was on Night Road. She hadn\u2019t even meant to turn here.</p><p>But here she was, at the hairpin turn. The skid marks were long gone, but the broken tree remained, its pinkish flesh almost black now. Dying.</p><p>She came to a stop and half stumbled off the bike, hearing it clatter to the pavement behind her. On either side of her, trees blocked out the sun.</p><p>The memorial to Mia was tattered now, only visible if you knew what to look for. The small white cross had been grayed by the changing seasons and stood drunkenly to the left. Here and there empty vases lay in the bushes. An old, airless balloon hung limply on a high branch.</p><p>She released her breath in a long, shaky sigh.</p><p>In prison, she\u2019d spent years in group therapy, talking about the pain, the remorse. Her counselor had told her often that time and hard work would heal her. That she would be whole when she could forgive herself.</p><p>As if.</p><p>Even if she could forgive herself, which was inconceivable, it wouldn\u2019t bring Mia back. That was what all those positive thinkers didn\u2019t get: some things could never be made right. If Lexi became Mother Teresa, Mia would still be dead and it would still be Lexi\u2019s fault. It had been six years, and still Lexi prayed to Mia every night. Every morning she woke to a split second of joy and then the pulverizing reality. It was that sense of loss that had caused her to turn to Valium for a few years, but ultimately she\u2019d discovered that you could run from your pain, but you couldn\u2019t hide. It was something she should have known already, a lesson she should have learned from her mother. When she realized the ugly truth\u2014that she was becoming her mother\u2014she quit taking the Valium. She was so clean now she hardly even took aspirin. The only real answer lay in the courage to see a thing clearly and try to do better. Be better.</p><p>She knelt there a long time, on the cold, hard roadside, knowing it was dangerous to be stopped on this curve and not caring. If anyone saw her here ...</p><p>Finally, she got back on the bike and started to ride. She almost sped right past the Farraday house, but at the last minute she stopped. Even in the falling darkness, she could see how different the place looked. The garden was untended, the planter boxes were empty.</p><p>She saw the mailbox: their name was still on it.</p><p>When a pair of headlights shone at her, she jumped on the bike and rode away. From a safe distance, she watched a silver Porsche turn into the driveway behind her.</p><p>Miles.</p><p>Sighing, she rode back into town and bought dinner at a fast-food place. At Scot\u2019s office, she locked up the bike and went inside through the back door. In the conference room, she found a red floral sofa bed with a neat pile of white sheets set on the cushion. Beside the sheets lay a manila envelope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She picked up the envelope. Below it, stuck to the cushion, was a pink Post-it note.</p><p>Lexi\u2014She\u2019s in kindergarten. Morning class.</p><p>F.Y.I.</p><p>S</p> <p>She opened the manila folder and found a single photograph. There, smiling up at her, was an elfin blond-haired girl in a pink blouse.</p><p>Her daughter.</p><p>Man plans. God laughs.</p><p>Lexi understood that sentence for the first time.</p><p>She had planned her release from prison down to the smallest detail. She\u2019d talked about her plans in Group and told Tamica everything. She had intended to go to Florida and move in with Eva and Barbara and start looking for a job. She\u2019d even dreamed of graduate school. She would make a good social worker; maybe she could help girls in trouble. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her that once she left the razor wire behind, she would be back in a world where unexpected things happened.</p> <p>Who would have thought she\u2019d end up here, on Pine Island? The only place in the world she didn\u2019t want to be.</p><p>She made up the sofa bed and then crawled between the softest sheets she\u2019d ever felt. Pale light from an outside street lamp fell through the window, lighting the dark room. She closed her eyes and tried to will herself to sleep, but it was so quiet, and she could have sworn that the picture of Grace was breathing.</p><p>For years, she\u2019d ruthlessly suppressed all thoughts of her daughter. She walked away when Tamica mentioned Grace and turned away when the TV screen showed images of little girls running into their mothers\u2019 arms. She\u2019d told herself that Grace deserved the kind of life Lexi could never offer.</p><p>But now, in the dark, with the photograph beside her, she felt that resolve weaken.</p><p>She slept fitfully, dreaming dreams that were best forgotten. Finally, at six o\u2019clock, she threw the covers back. Padding barefooted to the bathroom, she was surprised to find a shower. She took her first private shower in years and dried off with a soft white towel.</p><p>Her reflection afterward showed a face that was pointed and thin, like a drowned rat, framed by wispy black curls. Towel drying her hair, she dressed in the courtroom clothes that were all she had and went in search of breakfast, which she found at a local diner.</p> <p>Still, the photograph in her purse kept breathing. Sometimes she heard a giggle, and, irrationally, she thought it came from the bag.</p><p>After breakfast, she walked up Main Street and found a local thrift shop that was just opening for the day. She used seven dollars to buy a pair of secondhand Bermuda shorts, a blue T-shirt that had a dragonfly stenciled on the front, and an aqua cotton hoodie. She traded her black flats for a pair of flip-flops and threw the kneesocks away.</p><p>Walking out of the store, she smiled, feeling really free for the first time. She had a bus ticket to Florida in her pocket. In no time at all\u2014just seven and a half hours\u2014she\u2019d be on her way out of here ...</p><p>A yellow smear moved in a gust of black exhaust. A school bus. Small faces peered out from the windows.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t make a conscious decision to follow the bus; rather, she just kept walking. On Turnagin Way, she angled left and walked up the hill. By the time she reached the four-way stop, there were kids all around, laughing and talking and dragging ridiculously big backpacks on the sidewalk beside them. There were mothers everywhere, too, monitoring crosswalks and conversations and movement.</p><p>A line of buses was parked in front of the elementary school. The carpool lane ran through a row of parked cars, parents dropping their kids off.</p><p>A black SUV pulled past her and stopped.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s breath caught. From her place by the tree, she saw Jude get out of the SUV and go to the back passenger door, opening it wide.</p> <p>And there, sitting in a big car seat, was a miniature version of Mia, with buoyant corn-silk blond hair and a heart-shaped face.</p><p>Lexi inched sideways for a better view, making sure she was partially hidden within the crowd of schoolchildren.</p><p>Jude helped Grace out of the car and stepped back.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t smile, and Jude didn\u2019t give her a kiss, and then Grace walked away alone.</p><p>Lexi frowned. She couldn\u2019t help remembering how it had been before, when Jude had driven Mia and Lexi to school. The kisses, the hugs, the game-show contestant waves good-bye.</p><p>Maybe Jude was having a bad day. Or Grace had just said a bad word or gotten in trouble. Or maybe Grace had asked not to be kissed in public and Jude snuggled with her before they got in the car.</p><p>Lexi hardly noticed when the SUV started to move again. By the time she reached the crosswalk, it was in the line of cars exiting the school grounds, but Lexi wasn\u2019t looking there. All of her attention was focused on the little girl in the yellow T-shirt wearing a ridiculously big Hannah Montana backpack. Her shoulders were slumped, and she moved reluctantly toward the school, dragging her feet.</p><p>No one talked to Grace as she walked into the school.</p><p>Moments later, the bell rang, and the few remaining students ran for the school doors.</p><p>Lexi stood on the patch of grass between the bus lane and the carpool lane, staring at the now-quiet brick grade school. She\u2019s in kindergarten. Morning class.</p><p>She had walked alone into too many schools herself, with no one waving good-bye, no one coming to pick her up. She remembered how alone she\u2019d felt at lunchtime.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>That was what Lexi remembered most about her early childhood. She had always felt alone, a stranger in someone else\u2019s family, an outsider in some new school. Even after Eva, Lexi had never quite felt enfolded in a family ... until she\u2019d met the Farradays. From that first day of ninth grade, when she\u2019d met Mia and come home with her, Lexi had felt welcomed into their midst.</p><p>That was why she\u2019d given them custody of Grace, so her daughter would know how it felt to be loved.</p><p>Lexi looked down at her watch. It was not quite nine o\u2019clock. How long did morning kindergarten last? Two hours? Three?</p><p>The bus for Florida didn\u2019t leave until 3:30. That gave her several hours with nothing to do.</p><p>She could ride her bike around town or get something to eat or go to the library and read. But even as she ran through the list of things she could do, she knew there was only one thing she wanted to do.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it. You made your choice. Think of Grace.</p><p>The arguments rifled through her thoughts, but she paid them no mind. She couldn\u2019t, not this time. For every day of her daughter\u2019s life, Lexi had pictured Grace happy and well adjusted. Loved and adored. That Grace she could make herself walk away from.</p><p>But this little girl, with her draggy feet and slumped shoulders ... this little girl didn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cShe is though,\u201d Lexi said aloud. \u201cAnyone can have a bad day.\u201d</p><p>Still, she walked around the school, up past the portables, to the big playground out back. Here, confined within a chain-link fence was the elementary school play yard: basketball hoops and paved pads and grassy areas and a baseball diamond. She found a giant evergreen shadowing a patch of grass. There, she sat down and waited.</p><p>As the minutes passed, she told herself she\u2019d misinterpreted what she\u2019d seen, imposed her own sad school history on Grace. Her daughter was a happy girl\u2014she had to be\u2014the Farradays were the Bradys for a new generation. No one lived in the Brady house and felt lonely or unloved. She\u2019d prove it to herself and then be on her way.</p><p>Around ten-thirty, a bell rang. The big double doors banged open and a herd of small kids ran out onto the playground.</p><p>Kindergarten recess. It was obvious. There were only about thirty kids, and they were so small. A pretty brunette woman in jeans and a red blouse supervised their play.</p><p>Lexi got to her feet, moving along the fence line.</p><p>Grace was the last one to come out of the school. She stood off to the side, alone. She seemed to be talking to herself. To the back of her hand, actually. The other kids laughed and played and ran around. Grace just stood there, talking to her watch.</p><p>Smile, Lexi thought. Please.</p><p>But Grace never smiled, not once, during that ten-minute recess. None of the kids talked to her, and she didn\u2019t join into any of the games.</p><p>No one likes her, Lexi thought, with a stab in her chest. \u201cGracie,\u201d she whispered, shaking her head.</p><p>Across the playground, Grace looked up, although she couldn\u2019t possibly have heard her name spoken aloud. Lexi felt that look pierce her. Unable to help herself, she waved.</p><p>Grace looked behind her. Seeing no one there, she turned back to Lexi. Slowly, she smiled and waved back. Then the bell rang and she ran into the school.</p><p>Lexi could have lied to herself then, could have made up stories or tried harder not to care, but she didn\u2019t bother with any of that. She didn\u2019t want to rush to judgment, didn\u2019t want to make a terrible mistake\u2014again\u2014but neither could she ignore what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>No.</p><p>Grace might be unhappy, and that changed everything.</p><p>There would be an empty seat on the Florida-bound bus today.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Grace sat in the backseat of the car, feeling very small.</p><p>\u201cHow was school today?\u201d Nana asked without looking in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make any new friends?\u201d</p><p>Grace hated that question. Her grandmother asked it all the time. \u201cI am queen of the kindergarten. Allison Shunt is making me a crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Grace sighed. It was wonderful, for Stephanie, who really was the queen of the kindergarten. She stared down into the little magic mirror on her wrist, wishing Ariel would come to visit her, but the circle was blank.</p><p>Ariel, she mouthed. I\u2019m lonely.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Grace rested her head on the car seat\u2019s fluffy side and stared out the window, watching the big green trees blur past. They drove up one street and down another and around a big corner, and then they were home.</p><p>Nana drove carefully down the dirt driveway to the cabin.</p><p>Grace waited patiently to be let out of her car seat, and, once freed, she grabbed her backpack and followed Nana up the gravel path to their front door.</p><p>Inside, she heard Nana mutter something under her breath as she start picking up stuff. Nana didn\u2019t like Daddy to leave clothes lying around, and she hated Gracie\u2019s toys.</p><p>Grace turned on the TV and climbed up onto the sofa to wait for her daddy. When Nana wasn\u2019t looking, she sucked her thumb. She knew it was a babyish thing to do, but Nana made her nervous and sucking her thumb helped.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Nana said.</p><p>Grace pulled the thumb out of her mouth. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sucking my thumb. I was biting my fingernail. Is that bad, too?\u201d</p><p>Nana frowned, and Grace felt her heart beat faster again, a sick feeling settled in her tummy.</p><p>Nana came closer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with sucking your thumb, Grace.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was sweet and silky, like honey, and Grace felt herself starting to smile. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should try it.\u201d</p><p>Grace giggled. \u201cIt makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there was no God. That\u2019s what you told Daddy when he wanted to go to the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>Nana\u2019s smile faded. \u201cI\u2019m going to make dinner now.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew immediately that she\u2019d done something bad again. She wanted to suck her thumb, but instead she dragged her blanket into her lap and sat there, watching Nana cook. No one said anything for the longest time. Grace kept looking down at her wrist mirror, whispering Ariel\u2019s name, but her friend was gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the next two hours it was just Grace and her grandmother, together in this small house, hardly ever talking.</p><p>Then, finally, Daddy was home. Grace heard his car drive up, saw the headlights flash light into the house. She jumped down from the sofa and ran for the front door.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d she yelled when he came into the house. He dropped his big backpack and scooped her into his arms. Just like that, her world righted itself.</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that, but she could see how tired he was. His eyelids were kind of saggy, and he\u2019d forgotten to comb his hair again today.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething smells good.\u201d</p><p>Nana came into the room. She was wiping her hands on a towel, but that was stupid because she never made a mess or got dirty. \u201cMeatloaf and au gratin potatoes. The salad is in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he said, starting to loosen his hold on Grace.</p> <p>She clung to him like a cobweb. \u201cI love you, Daddy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Nana came closer. She peered at Daddy, her pretty face turning into another frown. \u201cYou aren\u2019t sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinals,\u201d he said.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t understand. Of course he wasn\u2019t sleeping. He just got home. \u201cAre we gonna play rodeo tonight, Daddy?\u201d That was her favorite. She got to ride on his back while he bucked her high into the air.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Grace should stay with us tonight,\u201d Nana said.</p> <p>Grace tightened her hold on her daddy. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you, Daddy. I promise. I\u2019ll let you study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d Daddy said, \u201cbut we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Nana gave him a long steady look, and then shrugged. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be here before eight to pick her up. Don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt a rush of relief when Nana was gone. She didn\u2019t quite know why, but her grandmother scared her. It was like playing with someone\u2019s extraspecial toy, you were always afraid you were going to accidentally break it.</p><p>She looked at her daddy and saw how tired he was. She hated when he got quiet. \u201cThey made me the queen of kindergarten,\u201d she said, hoping to make him proud.</p><p>\u201cEven after you punched Austin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one likes him, Daddy. They were glad I punched him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, the Lord of the Flies day care?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He carried her over to the sofa and sat down. She snuggled up to him, resting against his chest. This was her favorite place in the whole world. The only time she ever felt safe was when he was holding her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did they make you queen?\u201d</p><p>She scrunched her face in thought. Then she remembered Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Charlie got to be the winner cuz he was the nicest boy. \u201cI saved Brittany from drowning. She went in too deep so I saved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved Brittany from drowning,\u201d he said, staring down at her.</p><p>She felt her cheeks grow hot. How come lies just popped out of her mouth like little soap bubbles? She couldn\u2019t help it. No wonder no one liked her.</p><p>Daddy touched her cheek. \u201cYou know, Grace, when I was a kid, I thought I had to do everything right. Go to the right school, get the right grades, follow the rules. I wanted to make my mom ... and my sister ... proud of me.\u201d He looked away. For a long time, he was quiet, and the silence made her heart hurt. Had she said the wrong thing again? Finally he cleared his throat and said, \u201cThe point is: I\u2019m proud of you just the way you are. I love you no matter what, Gracie. You can take that to the bank.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what he meant. She hated the bank, except for the strawberry candies they gave out, and she knew the rest of it wasn\u2019t true. Once, she\u2019d heard Daddy tell Papa that Grace was having trouble in school. Behavioral problems and no friends were the words she\u2019d heard through the door. Her daddy had said a really bad word and asked Papa when they all just got to be happy again.</p><p>He wanted her to have friends. It was important to him. \u201cI\u2019m pop\u2019lar, Daddy. I can\u2019t hardly finish my lunch cuz everyone is talking to me so much.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed her cheek. \u201cOkay, Princess,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cOkay. Now let\u2019s have something to eat before I pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the meatloaf,\u201d Grace said, smiling proudly at him. Her dad\u2019s smile was sad, and that scared her so much she added, \u201cAnd the \u2019tatoes.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again and got up. \u201cCome on, Gracie, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>She hurried along behind him, trying to keep up.</p><p>Once again, Jude had awakened too early. There was no light bleeding through the louvered blinds in her bedroom, but she could feel dawn gathering on the horizon like an army before a charge.</p><p>Beside her, she felt Miles move in his sleep; he turned toward her, took her in his arms, his breath a warm caress against the back of her neck.</p><p>She rolled over and snuggled close to him, slid her bare leg between his. His eyes opened slowly, lazily, and he smiled.</p><p>He leaned closer, kissed her lightly at first, then more passionately. His hands slid down her silky nightgown and found the lacy hem, then bunched it, dragged it up, up, until she was naked. He took off his boxer shorts and threw them aside.</p><p>She followed the lead of his desire, touched him the way he liked, arching into his hand until she had to have him inside of her. When she came, it was an explosion of feeling from somewhere deep inside of her. She cried out so loudly it embarrassed her, and when she collapsed beside him, she was trembling.</p><p>They never spoke about this new passion of theirs; she knew that he, like she, was afraid that words would jinx it. For so many years after their loss, sex had simply been gone, like smiles and laughter. Its return had surprised both of them. Somehow, they\u2019d learned to connect by touch, to communicate their love almost solely without words. It wasn\u2019t the A answer, wasn\u2019t enough for Miles, whom she still caught looking at her with infinite sadness most of the time, but it was what they had now, and she knew how lucky they were to have it.</p><p>She kissed him lightly and drew back. Reaching down for her nightgown, she slipped it back on and got out of bed. At the windows, she stopped and twisted the shades\u2019 rod, letting the light stream in. To her left was the garden she\u2019d given up on. It was a riotous mess of flowers and branches and leaves, without order or care. Ugly.</p><p>Miles came up beside her, kissed her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re still watching Grace today?\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded. \u201cZach has a finals study group this morning. He seems stressed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was stressed out second year and I wasn\u2019t a twenty-four-year-old single dad.\u201d He squeezed her upper arm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we bring Gracie over here? Zach can come over whenever he gets done. We can play a game. We still have that Candy Land around somewhere, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Jude saw their reflections in the window: watery, pencil-drawing-like shapes. At the words Candy Land, time fell away; she was a young mother again, hunkered down on the floor with her twins, reaching for a card, laughing ...</p><p>She slipped out of Miles\u2019s arms and went into the bathroom. She was out of her nightgown and into the shower before he could get to her.</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said, standing in the doorway, giving her that disappointed look again. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. It\u2019s just a game.\u201d Her voice barely cracked, but she knew it betrayed her.</p><p>There was a pause before he said, \u201cI\u2019ll go for a run and meet you at Zach\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run too much,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged. It was his way of dealing with the loss. He ran; he worked.</p><p>\u201cSee you later,\u201d she said finally. She stayed in the shower until she heard him leave, and then she got out and began drying her hair. By the time she\u2019d dressed in a pair of pale beige capris and a soft cotton T-shirt, she was in control of her emotions again.</p><p>Grief was like that these days: a stealth bomber. She could be going along just fine, moving forward, and then something would blow up unexpectedly. Years ago, when it had all been fresh, she could spend days off the path, in a gray world where nothing was stable. Now, she could right herself most of the time.</p><p>That was progress.</p><p>She started to leave the bathroom and remembered halfway to the door that she hadn\u2019t brushed her teeth or put on makeup.</p><p>She went back and brushed her teeth but decided to forgo the makeup. She\u2019d only have to remove it tonight, and nothing left her more wrung out than a day with Grace and Zach. It took so much effort to be present in their lives without really being present that she came home exhausted.</p><p>She went to her car, a black hybrid SUV, smaller than the old Escalade, and started the engine. Backing out of the garage, she executed a tight three-point turn and drove up the gravel driveway, noticing the wildness of their land. Everything had grown in the past few years; blackberry bushes climbed like bullies over everything.</p><p>She turned onto the main road and drove to Zach\u2019s house.</p><p>As always, walking into this cabin was a little like going back in time for Jude. The blue sofa was the one she and Miles had gotten for their first apartment; the chairs were from the year they\u2019d had the twins. They\u2019d stored all of their old furniture and outdated trinkets for their kids. They used to say jokingly, with two moving out, we\u2019ll need to save it all.</p><p>Zach was raising his daughter and going to med school in a house that mirrored the one in which she and Miles had done all the same things.</p><p>\u201cAnyone here?\u201d she called out.</p><p>Zach came around the corner from the kitchen, holding a cup of coffee and carrying Grace, who clung sleepily to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Zach said, rubbing Grace\u2019s back. \u201cI know I look like shit. I was up until four. Can you guys still watch Gracie today? I have study group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I can be home by seven.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded and went into the kitchen, where she started cooking breakfast. Because she kept Zach\u2019s house stocked with food, she knew she\u2019d find everything she needed for waffles, scrambled eggs, and a fruit plate.</p><p>When Miles got there, hair still wet from his shower and smiling in the way that only he among them still could, Jude felt a weight slide off her shoulders. Miles was the glue that held their lives together. Around him, Jude and Zach breathed easier.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my girl,\u201d Miles said, opening his arms wide.</p><p>Zach put Grace down and she ran for her grandfather, hurled her little pink polka-dot flanneled body at him.</p><p>Miles scooped her up and whispered something in her ear, and she giggled.</p><p>Jude felt a spasm in her chest. There were times, like this, when all that she\u2019d lost hit her so hard she had trouble standing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat while it\u2019s hot,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>\u201cYummy!\u201d Grace said, scampering out of Miles\u2019s arms and running for the table. As always she sat next to a blank spot and an extra place setting. That was the place for her \u201cinvisible friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The alien princess trapped in a jar.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s the clinical stuff going?\u201d Miles asked Zach when he sat down.</p><p>\u201cI love the clinical. Diagnosing is awesome, but pharmacokinetics? That stuff is kicking my ass,\u201d Zach answered, scooping eggs onto his daughter\u2019s plate.</p><p>Miles reached over to stab a waffle with his fork. \u201cPathology was my downfall second year. I don\u2019t know why. You just have to get through it all with the knowledge. Third year is when you really get into it.\u201d</p> <p>Jude watched the way her son buttered Grace\u2019s waffle while he talked to his father, how he cut it up into small pieces for her and put her napkin in her lap, and she was so proud of him that she thought, we\u2019re all going to be okay. Someday we\u2019ll be laughing again.</p><p>She found herself smiling at the unexpected idea of happiness, of a future together. She listened to one of Zach\u2019s stories about diagnosing some terrible disease, and how he\u2019d screwed up, and she laughed along with her husband and son.</p><p>After breakfast was over, the unanticipated sense of lightness remained. Jude sent Zach off to the UW with a kiss on the cheek and a hug that was so fierce he actually frowned at her.</p><p>\u201cGo on. We\u2019ll have fun today,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom,\u201d Zach said.</p> <p>\u201cNo problema,\u201d she answered without thinking. At the silly reminder of who they\u2019d been, she fell silent.</p><p>And then he was grabbing his backpack and heading out the door.</p><p>\u201cPapa, can I go to my playhouse?\u201d Grace asked when her dad was gone.</p><p>\u201cPut on your clothes and brush your teeth first,\u201d Miles said distractedly. He was looking for the TV remote. When he found it, the screen thumped to life and a baseball game filled the screen. Miles flopped onto their old sofa and put his feet up on the coffee table.</p><p>While Jude washed the dishes, she saw a yellow flash blur past her. \u201cStay away from the water, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAriel and me are just gonna play Barbies in the playhouse,\u201d Grace answered, grunting to open the sliding glass door.</p> <p>\u201cAriel and I,\u201d Jude said automatically. \u201cMiles, do the ordinary rules of grammar apply to imaginary friends?\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cHuh? What was that, babe?\u201d</p><p>Jude went back to washing the dishes. She heard the sliding door thump shut and she glanced to the left.</p><p>Outside, Grace ran nimbly across the yard, toward the pink and yellow Princess Playhouse Santa had brought her last year. It was positioned just beyond the deck, on a patch of grass that looked out over the gray sandy beach.</p><p>\u201cCome on, hurry,\u201d Grace was yelling to her imaginary friend.</p><p>Jude dried the dishes and put them away. When she was finished, she glanced out at Grace again. She could see her granddaughter through the plastic castle\u2019s open window. She was talking to the air while she made Barbie dance.</p><p>\u201cYou going out to the magic kingdom?\u201d Jude asked Miles.</p><p>\u201cIn a sec. I just want to see this play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to make them a chicken casserole for dinner,\u201d Jude decided on the spot. She didn\u2019t want Zach to be hungry when he got home from studying.</p><p>She moved through the familiar family recipe with almost no effort. Every few minutes she looked up to make sure that Grace was okay, and then she went back to work.</p><p>When the casserole was in the fridge, along with a note about cooking it, she cleaned up the kitchen again and then headed into the living room. She was about to say something to Miles when a flash of movement caught her eye.</p><p>She opened the sliding glass door and stepped out onto the weathered deck. It was a beautiful June day, with sharp blue skies and no clouds. To the right of the property was a thick stand of evergreens that blocked the view of the neighboring house.</p><p>Grace was standing by the trees.</p><p>Beside her stood a girl dressed in faded shorts and a blue T-shirt. Was it Mildred\u2019s daughter, from next door? Was she home from college?</p><p>Then the girl turned and Jude saw her face.</p><p>Jude reached out to the sliding glass door to steady herself and was about to call for her husband when pain exploded in her chest. It hurt so much she couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t do anything except plaster her hand over her heart and fall to her knees.</p><p>Lexi rode down to LaRiviere Park.</p><p>As she got off the bike and looked out over the gray sandy beach, with its mounds of silvered driftwood tangled along the shore, she was assailed by memories.</p><p>She locked her bike into the rack and then moved past the driftwood, remembering the first time Zach had told her he loved her. They\u2019d been right there ...</p><p>She walked down to the pebbled beach. Here, the stones were polished to glassy perfection by the waves. Counting the houses, she knew when she reached her destination.</p><p>There it was: the old Tamarind cabin. There had been a party here once, back in her junior year of high school. Jude had never found out about that one.</p><p>Tall cedar trees ran in a thick line along one side of the property. To their right, on the lot next door, she saw a colorful plastic castle/playhouse, complete with a pointed gray turret and bright pink pennant. Beside it, perched like a baby bird at the end of the grayed deck, sat a little girl dressed in yellow. She was talking to her wrist again.</p><p>Lexi approached her daughter slowly, taking care to stay hidden by the trees. The last thing she wanted was for Zach to come storming out of the house like a Nazgul, telling her to get the hell away from his daughter.</p><p>Really, all Lexi wanted was to make sure that Grace was happy. Everything could go on as planned as long as Grace was happy.</p><p>She started to say, \u201cHey,\u201d but her voice caught. She cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cHey, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not s\u2019posed to talk to strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a stranger, Gracie. I\u2019ve known you all your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Grace cocked her face to the right, studying Lexi. Her lips pursed. \u201cI saw you at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It took everything Lexi had inside of her just to stand there. She wanted to fling herself at Grace and hold her in her arms and beg for forgiveness. Still, she took care to stand in the shade of the trees, out of the house\u2019s view.</p><p>\u201cYou waved. How come?\u201d</p><p>Lexi took a step closer. Her heart was taking flight. \u201cI knew you when you were a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know my daddy?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Grace\u2019s face scrunched up. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he still like chocolate-chip-mint ice cream and hate anything that looks like a comb?\u201d</p><p>Grace giggled and immediately covered her mouth to stifle the sound. \u201cNana says his hair looks like a beetle, which is funny cuz beetles are gross. Especially the ones who live on poop.\u201d</p><p>Lexi battled a smile. \u201cCan I stand by you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Lexi moved closer, stood beside a huge tree. \u201cHow come you\u2019re out here all alone?\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s little face drooped. \u201cMy daddy is gone. Again. Nana\u2019s in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your grandma still dance while she cooks?\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned up at her. \u201cShe hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grandma Jude hates you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look like her.\u201d</p><p>A chill crept down Lexi\u2019s spine. \u201cHer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s dead sister. That\u2019s why Nana never looks at me. I\u2019m not s\u2019posed to know that, but I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was murdered by pirates. That\u2019s why no one talks about it.\u201d Grace sighed. \u201cMy daddy sometimes cries when he looks at me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do look like Mia,\u201d Lexi said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou knew Daddy\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lexi said quietly. \u201cShe was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, do you have a dog?\u201d</p><p>Lexi was startled by the change in subject. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve never had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a dog. Or maybe a chipmunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you asked your dad for a pet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had rattlesnake for dinner last night. With peanuts.\u201d</p><p>Something was going on here; Grace was throwing stuff at her, but why? Had the talk of Zach\u2019s emotions scared her? Lexi said the only thing she could think of. \u201cI ate ostrich once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your daddy\u2019s not here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m a big girl. I get to stay home alone all the time. I can take my own bath and everything. Last night I made dinner all by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he go out a lot?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded.</p><p>Lexi studied her daughter\u2019s gorgeous face, with its sad green eyes and pale skin, and wondered if she\u2019d left any mark on this girl at all. \u201cDo you have any friends at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-friends?\u201d Grace said, then grinned. \u201cTons. I\u2019m the most pop\u2019lar girl in the class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky. I was lonely sometimes in school,\u201d Lexi said, watching her daughter closely. She couldn\u2019t help herself; she took a step closer.</p><p>Grace\u2019s lips trembled a little. \u201cI really don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace!\u201d someone yelled sharply. \u201cGet in here. Now.\u201d</p><p>Lexi jumped back into the trees. Peering around a shaggy green branch, she saw the cabin. The sliding glass door was open, and Miles stood there, frowning. He hadn\u2019t seen Lexi, she was sure of it. So why did he sound so pissed?</p><p>\u201cGrace, damn it,\u201d he yelled again. \u201cGet in here. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta go.\u201d Grace popped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cDoes he always yell at you like that?\u201d</p><p>Grace started to turn away, but Lexi dared to reach out and take hold of her girl\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019d like to be your friend,\u201d she said softly. It was hard to stop there. Suddenly there was so much more she had to say. She\u2019d been a fool for thinking she could walk away from her daughter.</p><p>A smile broke over Grace\u2019s face, its brightness warming Lexi. \u201cOkay. Bye,\u201d Grace said, waving. Then she turned and ran back for the house.</p><p>Lexi got up slowly. She understood at last how it felt to stop running.</p><p>She walked back to her bike, climbed aboard, and pedaled up the hill toward town.</p><p>An ambulance passed her, lights flashing, siren blaring, but she hardly noticed.</p><p>She was on her way to see Scot Jacobs.</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>Jude was in the emergency ward of Seattle Hope. She lay in a narrow bed, connected to all kinds of monitors and machines and alarms, but it was all unnecessary. She hadn\u2019t had a heart attack.</p><p>She looked up at her husband, feeling foolishly fragile. She\u2019d broken so easily, again. \u201cI thought all of that was behind me.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the sweat-dampened hair away from her face. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA panic attack.\u201d She practically spit the words out.</p><p>Grace climbed up the metal bed rails. She slipped and plopped back to the floor, then climbed up again. The rattling clang reverberated through Jude\u2019s tense body, made a headache blossom at the base of her skull. \u201cWhat\u2019s panic?\u201d Grace asked, banging her chin against the bed rail.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re scared,\u201d Miles said.</p><p>\u201cI saw a beach rat once. It was scary,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAnd those big hairy black spiders are scary. Did one crawl up your leg?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNana\u2019s really tired, Gracie,\u201d Miles said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you read that book over there for a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wanna know what scared Nana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Gracie. Okay?\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cIs it like when I had chicken pox and I just wanted sleep?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Papa.\u201d Grace slid down the side of the bed and shuffled over to the chair in the corner and sat down. She opened a tattered copy of The Cat in the Hat and tried to sound out the words.</p><p>Jude felt bad\u2014shaky, headachy, sick to her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m losing it, Miles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She loved the strong, steady movement of his hand through her hair. It calmed her more than any medication could. \u201cI thought I saw her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMia?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jude couldn\u2019t help feeling disappointed by the question. She\u2019d tried to see Mia. Neither psychics nor prayers had worked. And certainly, seeing Mia wouldn\u2019t cause Jude to think she was having heart failure. The opposite would be true: such a vision would restart her heart.</p><p>She glanced sideways, saw that Grace was absorbed by the challenge of reading. \u201cLexi,\u201d Jude whispered. It was the first time she\u2019d said the name aloud in years. \u201cShe was talking to Gracie.\u201d</p><p>Miles took her hand in his. He didn\u2019t look at all ruffled by her admission, and his calm soothed her. \u201cIt\u2019s common to experience dreamlike sensations or perceptual distortions during a panic attack. You know that. Remember the time you thought a car was going to hit Grace? If I hadn\u2019t been there, you would have killed yourself running into traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d Jude said, but even as she said it, she questioned herself. So many weird things had happened to her since Mia\u2019s death. \u201cHer hair was short and curly. And she was really thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Lexi,\u201d Miles said evenly. She loved how certain he sounded. Sometimes Miles\u2019s certainty made Jude want to gouge his eyes out, but now she wanted to share his calm.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer sentence was up in November. Remember how tense we all were, waiting to see if she would show up here?\u201d</p><p>Tense was an understatement. Jude had spent the end of last year strung tighter than a trip wire. It wasn\u2019t until mid-January that she had begun to relax. Miles had wanted to call the state and track Lexi\u2019s movements, but Jude had been adamant about no contact whatsoever. She hadn\u2019t wanted anyone in their family to even say Lexi\u2019s name aloud, let alone find out where she\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t show. Didn\u2019t call or send a note. And she sent Zach\u2019s letters back unopened,\u201d Miles said reassuringly. \u201cLexi made her decision. She thinks G-R-A-C-E is better off without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as if you disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always disagreed. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked up. \u201cDid you just spell my name, Papa?\u201d</p><p>Miles smiled tightly at his granddaughter. \u201cI was testing you. Good job, Poppet.\u201d</p> <p>Grace beamed at him. \u201cI\u2019m the best speller in my class. I\u2019m getting a trophy for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not coming back, Jude,\u201d Miles said softly, leaning down to kiss her forehead. \u201cAll of that is behind us.\u201d</p><p>Grace loved hospitals. They were grownup places, and because her Papa was a surgun\u2014or something like that\u2014people brought her books and juice boxes and gave her paper and crayons. Sometimes, when a doctor wanted to be alone with Nana and Papa, one of the nurses would even take her for a walk through the busy hallways. Her favorite was seeing the newborn babies in the see-through plastic boxes. She loved their tiny pink and blue caps.</p><p>Even so, after a few hours, she was bored. Ariel was hiding; she hadn\u2019t come to Grace\u2019s wrist mirror since the playhouse, and Grace\u2019s hand was hurting from coloring so many pictures.</p><p>She was about to whine\u2014again\u2014when the door to Nana\u2019s room burst open. Dad rushed in, carrying a huge stack of books under one arm. \u201cHow is she?\u201d he asked Papa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Nana said. She smiled, but it looked sorta flat. Like she was tired. \u201cYou two don\u2019t need to go into doc speak. I had a panic attack that felt a hell of a lot like a heart attack. They\u2019re discharging me now. It\u2019s embarrassing, really.\u201d</p><p>Dad put his books down on the chair beside Grace. Ruffling her hair, he moved past her and went to the bedside. \u201cPanic attack? You haven\u2019t had one of those in years. Not since\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nana held up a shaking hand. \u201cWe all know the history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thought she saw Lexi,\u201d Papa said.</p><p>Daddy drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>This was news. Nana had a reason, and the reason had a name. Grace scrambled up the metal bed rails again and hung on. \u201cWho\u2019s Lexi?\u201d</p><p>No one answered her. They just looked at one another.</p><p>\u201cA delusion?\u201d Daddy asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYour dad thinks so,\u201d Nana said. \u201cHopefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s made her feelings pretty clear,\u201d Daddy said. \u201cLexi, I mean. She\u2019s probably in Florida with Eva.\u201d</p><p>Grace reached over and put her hand in his back pocket. It made her feel connected to him, even if he hardly noticed. \u201cWho\u2019s Lexi?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cMildred\u2019s niece is back from school,\u201d Daddy said. \u201cShe has dark brown hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s who it was,\u201d Nana said.</p><p>Grace bounced a little on the bed rail. The metal clanged. It bugged her that no one was paying attention to her. \u201cI saw a baby with four arms,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Gracie home, Zach?\u201d Nana said. \u201cShe\u2019s been really good.\u201d</p><p>Grace slithered down from her perch and went to the desk, where she gathered up all her pictures and crayons. Taking one drawing of a butterfly on a flower, she handed it to her Nana. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>Nana stared at the picture. \u201cThanks, Gracie. I feel better already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re magic crayons. They make anyone better. That\u2019s why the hospital has \u2019em,\u201d Grace said earnestly. \u201cThe yellow ones can fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Grace,\u201d Daddy said. He gathered all their things together and took her out to the car.</p><p>She climbed into the car seat in the back, and he strapped her in.</p><p>All the way home, Grace talked to her daddy.</p><p>She\u2019d been quiet for hours, and she had so much to say. She told him about the new game Ariel had taught her and the sand dollar she\u2019d found by the playhouse and about the new friend she\u2019d made today and the seagull that had landed right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cLook, Daddy,\u201d Grace said, sitting up straighter as they drove through town. \u201cThere she is. There\u2019s my new friend. Hi!\u201d Grace yelled at the closed window, waving furiously. \u201cDid you see her, Daddy? That\u2019s a cool bike she has. It\u2019s magic. I think she\u2019s a movie star. She said she ate an ostrich once.\u201d</p><p>Daddy kept driving. A few minutes later, he turned into their driveway and parked.</p><p>\u201cYou believe me about the ostrich lady, don\u2019t you? She says she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Gracie. No pretending tonight, okay? Daddy\u2019s had a tough day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t pretending,\u201d Grace said, stung by the accusation. She dragged her blanket off the seat beside her and wrapped it around her neck. Her daddy was in one of those moods where he wasn\u2019t listening to her; even when he looked at her, she got the feeling he wasn\u2019t paying attention. Like he was seeing someone else in his head. And he looked sad.</p><p>Grace had grown up around sad. She knew it was best to stay quiet and cuddle when he was like this. But she\u2019d been quiet all day, and she was desperate to talk to someone. To him.</p><p>In the house, Grace went right to the fridge and pulled out the heavy casserole Nana had made. She worked really hard not to drop it. \u201cThis goes in the oven, Daddy,\u201d she said, holding it out proudly.</p><p>He took it from her and put it in the oven. \u201cI\u2019m going to go take a shower. I\u2019ll put a DVD in for you.\u201d</p><p>She started to say she didn\u2019t want to watch a movie, but he was already turning away, going into the living room.</p><p>She climbed up onto the sofa with her blanket and sucked her thumb. No one was paying any attention to her, anyway. It seemed like Daddy took the longest shower in the world, and, when he was done and walking around in his baggy sweat pants, with his wet hair dripping onto the red USC T-shirt, she followed him around, talking about anything she could think of.</p><p>\u201cOn the way to the hospital, I got to sit in the front of Papa\u2019s car. We followed the am\u2019blance. And he let me drive ... just onto the ferry. I went really slow. I\u2019m a good driver. I saw a killer whale eat a seal. It was gross.\u201d</p><p>Nothing made him pay attention. He hardly even looked at her, and his face just got sadder and sadder, so much that Grace started to feel sad herself. Lonely.</p><p>By the time he put her into her jammies and tucked her into bed, she felt like crying.</p><p>Dad curled up alongside her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve been weird tonight, Princess. Being in the hospital reminded me of my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d she said solemnly, showing off that she remembered the name they hardly ever said aloud. \u201cI bet you hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much of a doctor if that were true.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cBesides, I got you in a hospital.\u201d</p><p>Grace snuggled against him. This was one of her favorite stories. \u201cWhat did I look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a perfect little princess. Your eyes were sort of brownish-blue then. You hardly even cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my mommy was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe named you Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you named me after your sister. Then you took me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved you from the very first second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but how come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Gracie,\u201d he said, reaching over for the book on the nightstand. \u201cDaddy\u2019s had a hard day. How about if I read more of The Secret Garden to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you want to hear about my new friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe movie star who ate an ostrich and rides a magic bike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might not really be a movie star. Maybe she\u2019s a spy who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Gracie,\u201d he said, opening the book. \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p><p>He knew, though; he always knew. Grace smiled sleepily and murmured, \u201cColin is better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah,\u201d Daddy said, turning to the right page and starting to read. \u201cOne of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever...\u201d</p><p>Grace popped her thumb into her mouth and listened to the music of her daddy\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThey yell at her, Scot. And she\u2019s always alone. No one bothers to come out and play with her. Her only friend seems to be invisible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy son\u2019s imaginary friend is a duck. What does that say about him, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious,\u201d Lexi said. She had spent endless hours wrestling with her own emotions, and no matter how often or how forcefully she told herself that Grace was better off without an ex-con for a mother, she couldn\u2019t trample the new feeling that she\u2019d been wrong to abandon her daughter. It was like opening the door on a tornado\u2014there was no stopping the damage that would be done inside, and no closing the door again.</p><p>Abandon. The word ate through Lexi\u2019s best intentions and stripped her bare. In all her attempts to be unlike her own mother, had she done the same thing? And how was it that she\u2019d never asked herself this question before?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Scot said, pushing back his chair. The metal wheels screeched on the Pergo flooring. \u201cIt\u2019s very serious. Why don\u2019t you sit down? You\u2019re moving like an egg beater.\u201d</p> <p>She did as he asked and sat down.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cGiving Grace up was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Her voice dropped; it was difficult to say the words, even after all her therapy. \u201cThe only thing that kept me going was this image of what her life would be like. I saw pink dresses and birthday parties with ponies and bedtime stories and family Christmas dinners. I saw a little girl who grew up knowing she was loved, knowing where she belonged.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cI trusted them, Scot,\u201d she said, anger surging up. \u201cAll of them. Miles. Jude. Zach. I trusted them to give her the childhood I never had. And you know what I found? A lonely little girl whose daddy is too busy to be with her ... a girl who gets yelled at for nothing ... who plays all alone. A girl with no friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p> <p>She got up again and began pacing. \u201cI\u2019m a felon. An ex-con. I\u2019m twenty-four years old with almost no job experience. Gee, I worked in the prison library and an ice cream shop, and I picked raspberries in the summer. I\u2019m broke. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your Aunt Eva have money when she took you in?\u201d</p><p>Lexi stopped moving and stared out of the office window. Outside, a young mother was helping her red-haired daughter up to a silver drinking fountain. \u201cShe had a job and a place to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a college degree and you\u2019re a hard worker. On top of that, you\u2019re one of the most honorable people I know. You know more about love\u2014and its lack\u2014than most people. So I\u2019ll ask you again: what do you want to do? It\u2019s a simple question. Either you stay or you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I choose to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would petition the court to modify the parenting plan. We\u2019d seek joint custody. Or, failing that, visitation rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSupervised, I suppose. Me being an ex-con.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a violent offender, Lexi,\u201d he said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t your mother. But yes, they might impose supervision at the start. I didn\u2019t say it would be easy, but you will get visitation rights at least, and you\u2019ll quite possibly get joint custody. We wouldn\u2019t get full custody, but you\u2019re her mother, Lexi. The court knows how important you are to her. And you\u2019re welcome to stay at my office until you find someplace else.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re her mother.</p><p>For years, even before Gracie was born, Lexi barred that thought from her consciousness. The words were simply too painful to consider, but now, hearing them spoken aloud, she heard their sweetness, and longing swelled inside of her.</p><p>She could hold Gracie, hug her and kiss her and take her to the park ...</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Scot said into the building silence. \u201cI imagine the Farradays will fight you.\u201d</p><p>It was too late to worry about that now. She\u2019d loosened the idea of motherhood, and it had uprooted her, swept her skyward. \u201cLet\u2019s file the papers,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p> <p>She finally turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Jude gave up trying to sleep at about four o\u2019clock. She left the warmth of her bedroom and made her way into the dark living room. There, standing in front of the tall black windows, she stared at her own tarnished reflection.</p><p>She knew what the doctors wanted her to believe: that panic had caused her delusion rather than the other way around.</p><p>She wanted to believe it, too.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t believe it and that was that. Sometime during the night, she\u2019d become convinced. So much so that hours later, when Miles shuffled through the great room in search of coffee, she said. \u201cI saw her. Lexi. I saw her.\u201d</p><p>Miles looked confused. \u201cWait.\u201d Walking past her, he went into the kitchen and came out with a cup of coffee. \u201cNone for you. You look ready to blast off as it is. Now, say it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her. I wasn\u2019t mistaken.\u201d She tapped her foot nervously, stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to keep track of her.\u201d</p><p>She nodded curtly. \u201cI know. I didn\u2019t. Out of sight, out of mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d He stood there, naked except for his blue boxers, staring out the window. \u201cOkay,\u201d he finally said and handed her his coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d</p><p>He went to his laptop, pulled up a phone number, and then made a call.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bill, sorry to call so early, but we have a situation here. Can you find out when Alexa Baill was released?... yes, I\u2019m aware we asked not to know. Something has changed. Yes. Thank you. I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and took his coffee back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked gently, touching her hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>They stood there together, staring out at the backyard, saying nothing as the sky turned bright and blue. Time passed like the beats of their hearts, quiet and steady. The phone startled Jude so much she let out a little scream.</p><p>Miles answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Jude tapped her foot again and crossed her arms, digging her fingernails into her own arms so tightly she almost drew blood.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Miles said, frowning. \u201cWhy is that? Oh. Okay, thanks. Again, sorry to bother you.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jude said, wishing she\u2019d downed a Xanax.</p><p>\u201cShe was released two days ago. Time was added onto her sentence for bad behavior.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s foot tapped so fast she was practically dancing. \u201cShe came straight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something. Get an injunction or something. Maybe we should move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not going to move.\u201d Miles took her by the shoulders and made her look at him. \u201cCalm down, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Jude felt hysterical laughter bubbling up inside of her. She knew it was inappropriate to laugh now, but her emotions were all cross-wired these days. Sometimes she cried when she was happy and laughed when she was scared and screamed when she was tired. She pulled free of Miles and ran to her bedroom, where she found her Xanax and fumbled to open the bottle. \u201cDamn child-proof caps.\u201d</p><p>Miles took it from her and opened it, handing her a pill, which she downed with his hot coffee. \u201cYou better get me an appointment with Dr. Bloom.\u201d</p><p>She survived the next two hours in a medicated haze. She washed and dried her hair and dressed in a pale beige summer-weight sheath. It wasn\u2019t until she was in Dr. Bloom\u2019s chair, squirming under the psychiatrist\u2019s sharp gaze, that she realized she was still in her slippers. \u201cThank you for making time for me,\u201d Jude said, trying to hide her slippered feet.</p><p>\u201cA panic attack. You haven\u2019t had one in more than eighteen months. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet Harriet\u2019s penetrating gaze. It made her feel weak and delusional. So she glanced to her left. \u201cI was at Zach\u2019s house on Saturday morning, making breakfast for everyone. Zach is studying for finals. School is going late this year. All those damn snow days add up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Harriet prompted.</p><p>\u201cI saw Gracie outside ... talking to ... Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi is the girl who was driving the car that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked much about her. In fact, I believe you said you\u2019d never come back if I mentioned her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of sight, out of mind,\u201d Jude answered by rote, tapping her foot again.</p><p>\u201cSo you saw her again, after all these years, and you had a panic attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was talking to Gracie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer daughter,\u201d Dr. Bloom said.</p><p>Jude snapped to her feet and started pacing. She was having trouble breathing. \u201cShe gave up that right when she went to prison. She signed documents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that when you think she gave up the right to be a mother? When she went to prison? Or when she killed your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Jude said, breathing hard now. Her chest hurt. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? She can\u2019t waltz back in and act as if it never happened. Zach finally has his life back on track. I won\u2019t let him see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down, Jude,\u201d Dr. Bloom said in a reasonable voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she wants ... what if\u2014oh, God.\u201d Jude drew in a great gulping breath and started to panic. Dr. Bloom was beside her almost instantly, touching her back, rubbing it in a soothing way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right, Jude. Just breathe. Here, sit down.\u201d</p><p>Jude got her breathing under control and the pain in her chest receded. With a shaking hand, she pushed the sweat-dampened hair out of her face and tried to smile. \u201cI\u2019m falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that really be so terrible?\u201d</p><p>Jude wrenched away from the doctor. \u201cAre you sure you went to med school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude. You can\u2019t control this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that pearl.\u201d She looked longingly at the door. This wasn\u2019t helping. \u201cI should have swallowed a handful of pills when...\u201d She couldn\u2019t say the words out loud. She\u2019d never been able to.</p><p>\u201cYou thought about it,\u201d Dr. Bloom reminded her. \u201cBut even in the darkest times, you had hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think hope is what stopped me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stopped you?\u201d</p><p>She was not going to answer that. She hated the answer, anyway. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Zach, damn it. He\u2019s fragile, like me. He\u2019s never gotten over his guilt ... or his grief. To see Lexi again ... and what if she wants to be Grace\u2019s mother? I won\u2019t let her be a part of our family again. Oh, God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already a part of your family,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent retort. By the way, you don\u2019t sound like a woman who feels nothing for her granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Jude reached for her purse, snagged it. \u201cI need to see a lawyer, not a shrink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you need a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to protect Grace and Zach. Maybe we need a restraining order...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think keeping Lexi away will protect them?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course. Have you even been listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi is your granddaughter\u2019s mother,\u201d Dr. Bloom said gently. \u201cYou tell me you used to put a lot of store in motherhood.\u201d</p><p>Jude reeled back. \u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d Without waiting for a response, she headed for the door. As she wrenched it open, she heard Dr. Bloom say, \u201cShe was eighteen years old, Jude. Think about that.\u201d</p><p>Jude slammed the door behind her.</p> <p>Twenty-two</p><p>Jude called Miles and asked him to meet her at Zach\u2019s; then she drove straight down to the ferry dock. Her timing was impeccable. They were loading the boat when she got there.</p><p>The thirty-minute Sound crossing seemed to take forever. She tapped her fingers nervously on the steering wheel.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure about anything except this: she had to get to Grace. All she wanted to do right now was gather her family together, as if her arms were the safe place they\u2019d once been. What was left of her family, anyway, what Lexi had left of her family.</p><p>Off the ferry, she drove through town slowly, her eyes peeled for a dark-haired girl in Bermuda shorts and a drugstore T-shirt. She thought she saw Lexi a dozen times, and she stomped on the brakes so often that horns honked behind her.</p> <p>She veered onto Turnagin Way and drove past the elementary school to the day care. There, she got out of the car and strode up to the pretty little A-frame house that was the Silly Bear Day Care. Inside, she found an empty playroom full of brightly colored plastic tables and bean bag chairs.</p><p>She went out to the backyard, where a dozen kids were playing on Lincoln Logs\u2013type swing sets, in sandboxes, and in a playhouse. She took it all in at once, and then began looking for Grace, who she knew would be alone.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jude,\u201d said the day care\u2019s owner, Leigh Skitter. They had known each other for years. Leigh\u2019s youngest son had played soccer with Zach. \u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Grace,\u201d Jude said, realizing too late that she hadn\u2019t said hello and that her voice was sharp.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with Lexi,\u201d Leigh said. \u201cShe sure looks different, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jude felt a chill go through her. \u201cYou let her see Grace?\u201d</p> <p>Leigh seemed surprised by the question, or maybe it was Jude\u2019s raised voice. \u201cShe said you\u2019d agreed to it. And there\u2019s no restraining order in place, is there? I mean, I know she doesn\u2019t have custody, but we all knew she\u2019d come back someday...\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t Jude thought of this scenario? Leigh Skitter had known Zach and Lexi in their high school days. She\u2019d said on several occasions how much she liked Lexi. No doubt she even felt a little sorry for her. So many people did\u2014when Dateline did their segment on the show, plenty of people piped up to say that Lexi\u2019s punishment had been too harsh. Yeah. Poor Lexi.</p><p>Jude felt the start of panic. Why hadn\u2019t they gotten a restraining order against Lexi, just in case? At the very least, she should have told Leigh and the school that Lexi was not to be allowed near her daughter. Didn\u2019t full custody give them that right?</p><p>\u201cJude? Is something wrong? Zach never asked me to keep Grace away from her mother.\u201d</p><p>Jude pushed past Leigh and ran across the sawdust-strewn backyard. At the childproof gate, she manipulated the latch and kept going, racing through the trees toward the beach. There, she shuddered to a halt.</p><p>There were kids everywhere, laughing and playing. The day care\u2019s other supervisor was over by the driftwood, watching the kids.</p><p>Calm down, Judith.</p><p>She scanned the shoreline.</p> <p>There she was\u2014a little blond girl alongside a dark-haired young woman.</p><p>Lexi.</p><p>Jude ran forward, almost falling in her sudden fury. She grabbed Lexi by the arm, spun her around.</p><p>Lexi paled. \u201cJ-Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Nana,\u201d Grace said. \u201cThis is my new friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace. Go over to Tami,\u201d Jude said tightly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jude yelled.</p><p>Grace flinched at the harshness of the command. Her little shoulders hunched forward and she shuffled away, her head hung low.</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to be here,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>As Lexi looked up, Jude noticed several things at once: Lexi was hard looking, almost stringy, but she was still very young. And when she noticed the girl\u2019s frizzy, curly, untamed hair, she thought of Mia saying, she\u2019s like me Madre, is that coolio or what? Jude stumbled back at the memory. She shouldn\u2019t have come here, shouldn\u2019t have approached Lexi. She wasn\u2019t strong enough. \u201cGo,\u201d Jude said weakly. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have.\u201d Jude felt frail enough to drop to her knees. It took concentration just to keep standing.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lonely,\u201d Lexi said, looking toward Grace, who stood apart from the other kids and stared back at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d Jude said bitterly. \u201cShe\u2019s grown up in a broken family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told myself I\u2019d see that she was happy and I\u2019d leave. But she\u2019s not happy.\u201d</p><p>Jude opened her purse, reached in for her wallet with shaking hands. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you to go. How much? Twenty thousand dollars? Fifty? Just tell me how much you want.\u201d Lexi\u2019s face changed at that, but Jude was shaking too hard to focus clearly. A dull thudding squeezed her chest and she had the terrible thought that she might pass out. \u201cA hundred thousand. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave her to Zach,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cGave her. Do you know how hard that was? Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosing a child?\u201d Jude said. \u201cYes, Lexi. I know how it feels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it because I loved her. And because I trusted you and Zach and Miles to be her family.\u201d</p><p>Jude saw the censure in Lexi\u2019s eyes, and she knew it was warranted, and that only made it hurt more. \u201cWe are her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s afraid of you, did you know that? She says you never hold her or kiss her. She wonders why you don\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>Jude felt exposed suddenly; fear bled up inside her, bubbled out until she was shaking so hard she dropped her purse. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d But the words had no bite, no venom.</p><p>\u201cI trusted all of you.\u201d Lexi\u2019s voice broke. It was the first evidence of real emotion, and Jude seized it.</p><p>\u201cZach has given up everything for Grace. Everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean USC, don\u2019t you? Your Holy Grail. You never cared that he was happy, just that he did what you wanted him to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved me. But that meant nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed his sister,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lexi said, her mouth trembling. \u201cAnd I have to live with that every day of my life. I did everything I could to make it up to you and Zach and Grace, but there is no making it up. I gave you my freedom and my daughter\u2014and still you want more. Well, fuck you, Jude. You don\u2019t get any more. Grace is my daughter. My Mia. And I want her back. My lawyer filed the petition today.\u201d</p><p>As Lexi walked away, Jude just stood there, eyes stinging, throat tight, hearing Lexi\u2019s voice say over and over again, my Mia.</p><p>Once Lexi started walking down the beach, she couldn\u2019t stop. She was going in the wrong direction; her bike was parked in the public area at the end of the dead-end road. But she couldn\u2019t turn around, couldn\u2019t watch Jude bundle Grace up and take her away, as if it were dangerous for Grace to know her own mother.</p><p>A cool summer breeze plucked at her hair. Her eyes watered in the wind. Still, she put her hands in her pockets and kept walking. She turned and looked back down the beach. Jude was still there.</p><p>Lexi wanted to be tough and hard, to feel that she was justified in coming here and wanting her daughter back, and she did feel it\u2014justified, for all the reasons she\u2019d given Jude. Mostly because the Farradays had had a chance to make Grace happy and they\u2019d failed.</p><p>But Lexi\u2019s guilt and remorse, always floating inside of her, were rising now. She had destroyed the Farradays. In the beginning, she\u2019d hoped that her years in prison would heal them somehow, but she knew better than anyone that time and distance didn\u2019t heal you. It had been na\u00efve to assume that Grace could be raised as Mia and Zach had, in the bosom of love and happiness. So in a way, it was Lexi\u2019s fault that her daughter was unhappy now.</p><p>All of that was true, and all of it weighed heavily on Lexi, but there was something else too, a lightness that she hadn\u2019t felt in years. It was hope\u2014a bright beam in the blackness of her guilt.</p><p>She could lift Grace up. She could be the kind of mother she\u2019d dreamed of having. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t have money or a big house or a new car, but Lexi knew better than most that love could be enough. Eva had proved that. She hated to hurt the Farradays\u2014and Zach\u2014again, hated it to her marrow, but she\u2019d paid enough for her mistake.</p><p>The decision anchored her. Wiping her eyes, she looked around, surprised to see how far she\u2019d walked. Behind her, the public beach was a gray comma of sand tucked tightly against dark woods. She couldn\u2019t tell if people were still there or not.</p><p>She started to turn back when a flash of hot pink plastic caught her eye. She paused, looked up the beach.</p><p>It was the playhouse, with its fluttery pink pennant and mock stone turret.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really make a decision to go that way. Rather, she just found herself moving toward it, walking, walking, and suddenly she was standing there, on the sandy beach, in the shade of a giant tree, looking at a little girl\u2019s playhouse.</p><p>But in her mind, she was on another beach, years ago, standing under a different tree, in the glow of distant house lights, with her best friend and the boy she thought she\u2019d love forever.</p><p>We\u2019ll bury it.</p><p>A pact.</p><p>We\u2019ll never say good-bye.</p><p>How shiny their na\u00efvet\u00e9 had been, like polished silver, glinting in the darkness. She had never believed in anything as much as she\u2019d believed in the three of them at that moment.</p><p>She bent down, peered through the small, plastic-shuttered window to the castle\u2019s interior. Several Barbies lay in plastic beds, their clothes scattered around. An open Dr. Seuss book lay beside an empty juice box.</p><p>Here was where Grace played alone.</p><p>Lexi let her fingers trail atop the flat, mock stone roof as she moved into the yard. The grass was lush and green\u2014summer hadn\u2019t sapped its color yet or turned it crisp. A worn deck jutted out from the log cabin, clearly a construction afterthought. In one corner was an old picnic table with two benches; beside it a plastic-tarped barbeque. Along the split-rail fence line, roses grew wild, their leggy green branches climbing over one another like adolescent boys offering bright pink flowers to a girl.</p><p>The house\u2014Zach\u2019s house\u2014was a rustic log cabin with a roof that sprouted moss along its seams. Gray stone chimneys bookended the place, seemed to hold it together. She remembered again the party they\u2019d come to here, as juniors. That was before alcohol had taken over their class. Back then, only a few of the kids had been drinking. Mia and Lexi had spent most of the night on the beach, just the two of them, listening to music coming from behind them. Zach had been dating Emily Adamson then, and Lexi remembered how sharp her longing for him had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sliding glass door rattled open, and there he was.</p><p>\u201cLexi.\u201d</p><p>How many times had she dreamed of seeing him again, of hearing him say her name that way?</p><p>He stepped out of the cabin and moved closer. She had thought of him so often, pored over his senior picture until every inch of his face was imprinted on her memory, so she saw instantly how much he had changed. He was taller, and his shoulders were broader, even as he\u2019d lost weight. He had on a ripped gray T-shirt that said USC and a pair of khaki shorts that hung low on his narrow hips. His face was sculpted and lean. He wasn\u2019t as heart-stoppingly handsome as he\u2019d been before; he had a hard, tired look to him, and his eyes were sad.</p> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Was there accusation in his voice? She reminded herself that he\u2019d let her down, that their daughter was unhappy living with him, but it couldn\u2019t quite grab hold, that emotion. As always, when she saw him, a part of her melted. It was her great weakness\u2014he was her weakness and had been from the moment she\u2019d first seen him. But she knew better now. He\u2019d let her go to prison and let her give up custody of their daughter. \u201cI needed to see Grace ... needed to know that she was happy.\u201d</p><p>The gravity that had always connected them exerted its force, and before she knew it, she was moving toward him. It wasn\u2019t until she was close enough to be held by him that she realized he hadn\u2019t moved toward her. He had stayed where he was and let her come to him. Of course.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI had to see my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lexi swallowed hard. She\u2019d imagined this reunion a thousand times, a million, and never had it been so awkward, so seething with loss and distance. She wanted to ask him about Grace, ask if her daughter was like her at all, but she couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t hand him her heart in those few words. It was a mistake she\u2019d made before.</p><p>He stared down at her. She could feel the heat from his body, and the soft exhalations of his every breath. \u201cShe makes a little whistling noise when she sleeps\u2014just like you do. Used to, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know how to respond. Of course he knew what was on her mind; he\u2019d always known what she was thinking. She was breathing faster now; so was he, she noticed. She stared at his mouth and remembered how he\u2019d looked when he smiled, and how much they used to laugh, and she felt the loss all over again.</p> <p>\u201cYou never answered my letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would have been the point?\u201d she said to him. \u201cI thought we\u2019d be better off if we just forgot each other. And those first two years in prison were ... hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to think about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>Used to. She swallowed hard, shrugged.</p><p>He touched her upper arm in a tentative, careful way, as if he were afraid she would either break or scream, or maybe he thought she wouldn\u2019t want him so close. She stood there, staring up at him, realizing with a start that she wanted him to kiss her.</p><p>Fool.</p><p>She stumbled back from him, needing distance between them. She\u2019d been an idiot to get this close. From the moment they\u2019d met, she\u2019d given him her heart. How could she not have learned anything after all that had happened? \u201cYou let me go to prison,\u201d she said to remind herself who he really was.</p><p>\u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me, Zach, you\u2019ve always had choices. I\u2019m the one who didn\u2019t.\u201d She took a deep breath and looked up at this boy\u2014man\u2014she\u2019d loved from the first time she saw him, and the pain of their past was overwhelming. \u201cI want Grace,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cI filed the papers today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you hate me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t do that to Grace. She won\u2019t understand. I\u2019m all she has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cThat\u2019s not true anymore.\u201d She heard a car drive up, tires spin on gravel, and she had no doubt about who had arrived.</p><p>Jude. Sweeping in to save her son and granddaughter from terrible Lexi.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Zach,\u201d Lexi said, turning away.</p><p>\u201cLexi, wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zach,\u201d she said without looking at him. \u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough.\u201d</p><p>Jude was shaking as she strapped Grace into her car seat.</p><p>\u201cOw, Nana!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Jude mumbled. A headache had spiked behind her eyes, and she could hardly see. She texted Miles to get home ASAP and then climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. But she couldn\u2019t go home. Lexi knew where they lived.</p><p>\u201cHow come I\u2019m goin\u2019 home early, Nana?\u201d Grace said from the backseat. \u201cWas I bad again?\u201d</p><p>Home. That was it.</p><p>She drove\u2014too fast\u2014to Zach\u2019s cabin and parked beside his truck. Once there, she took Grace in her arms and hurried inside, slamming the door shut behind her.</p><p>The sliding glass door was open. The whole place smelled of the beach at low tide. Zach stood on the deck, looking out at the Sound.</p><p>Jude carried Grace into her bedroom and put her down on her bed. Handing her a well-worn copy of Green Eggs and Ham, she said, \u201cRead this for just a minute, okay? I have to tell your daddy something, and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Jude left the room and closed the door behind her. Then she went out to the deck and approached her son. She could tell by his stance\u2014his shoulders rounded in defeat, his hands plunged deep in his pockets\u2014what had happened. She hadn\u2019t gotten here in time. \u201cLexi was here,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants another chance, but we don\u2019t get one. Mia will always be gone. I can\u2019t look at the girl who killed her every day.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at her. \u201cGrace is her daughter, Mom.\u201d</p><p>The simplicity of that made Jude catch her breath. She felt suddenly as if she were hurtling toward a precipice, as if they all were. It scared her to her bones; in the past years, they\u2019d healed just enough to survive. They couldn\u2019t go through it again.</p><p>She\u2019d watched from a distance as her immature, coltish boy had become a man. Grief had shattered him; fatherhood had put him back together.</p><p>She flipped open her cell phone and called the friend who had been their lawyer for years. \u201cBill. Jude Farraday. The girl who killed Mia is out of prison, and she\u2019s filed a petition to get custody of Grace ... tomorrow? Great. See you then.\u201d Jude hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cGrace is unhappy,\u201d Zach said, and the heartbreak in his voice was terrible.</p><p>\u201cLexi isn\u2019t the answer, Zach. She\u2019s the cause. Remember that.\u201d Jude touched his arm. He needed her to be strong now. Maybe he\u2019d needed that for years and not had it, but she would be there for him now; this time she would protect him.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>The next morning, Jude woke up early and dressed carefully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a funeral,\u201d Miles said when he saw her in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cReally? It feels like one. I\u2019ll meet you in the car,\u201d she said, hurrying away from him. The last thing she wanted to hear right now was his moral superiority or more endless questions about what they were doing. Of course, the Zen Master wanted to explore the idea that bringing Lexi into their lives could heal them. Last night, when they\u2019d gotten home from Zach\u2019s, she\u2019d actually told him to shut up for the first time in their marriage.</p><p>He\u2019d learned his lesson, apparently, because he said nothing as they picked up Grace at kindergarten, dropped her off at the Silly Bear, and drove into Seattle.</p><p>At one o\u2019clock, Zach joined them in the lobby of the Smith Tower, and by ten past, they were seated in a corner office that overlooked Elliott Bay and Pine Island. From this vantage point, the island was a mound of thick green forests floating on a steel blue sea; it looked uninhabited.</p><p>\u201cScot had the petition delivered to my office,\u201d Bill said when they\u2019d finished with the pleasantries. \u201cAlexa Baill is seeking to modify the parenting plan in which Zach has full custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to take Grace away from me?\u201d Zach asked, sitting very still. \u201cShe thinks I\u2019ve been a bad father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually. She is seeking joint custody,\u201d Bill answered.</p><p>\u201cHow can she do that?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cShe gave up custody when Grace was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParenting plans are rarely set in stone, Jude. In this case, Alexa will need to show a substantial change in circumstances\u2014which getting out of prison certainly provides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what will happen?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we\u2019ll have what\u2019s called an adequate-cause hearing, which establishes only that her circumstances have changed enough to move forward. Next comes the motion for a temporary order. This will establish the custody or visitation rights pending trial. Realistically, it will be at least a year before we actually go to trial. A guardian ad litem will be appointed by the court to determine what the best interests of the child are and to represent Grace\u2019s interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds expensive,\u201d Miles said. \u201cHow can she afford that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a Legal Aid lawyer. Or someone might handle the case pro bono,\u201d Bill said.</p><p>\u201cAt best she\u2019ll get visitation rights; at worst, joint custody. Know this, though: the court will be pushing for reunification with the mother unless she\u2019s clearly unfit or poses a danger to Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying she\u2019ll be a part of our lives forever,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cShe already is,\u201d Miles answered. \u201cShe\u2019s Grace\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t speaking to you,\u201d Jude hissed at her husband. To their lawyer, she said, \u201cBut she is unfit. She abandoned Grace at birth and never even sent her a birthday card. She has no job, no family around here. Her own mother was a felon and a drug addict. Who\u2019s to say what friends she made in prison? We wouldn\u2019t want Grace exposed to people like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Zach said, straightening. \u201cCome on. That\u2019s not even fair. Lexi is nothing like her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to fight her on this,\u201d Bill said, giving Zach a steely look. \u201cYou\u2019re a father now. Not a high school kid. Your job is to protect Grace; to do that, you need to preserve your rights. If Alexa got custody, even partial, who is to say she wouldn\u2019t take off with Grace? And she made a choice, as I understand it. She\u2019s never communicated with Grace. Not once. That doesn\u2019t exactly give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about her parenting. We have to do what\u2019s in your daughter\u2019s best interest. At least for now, we have to keep her away from Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>\u201cHow is that in Grace\u2019s best interests?\u201d Zach said. \u201cLexi is her mother.\u201d</p><p>Bill opened a file. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how it\u2019s in her best interests. I\u2019ve read Alexa\u2019s prison record, Zach, and it\u2019s not pretty. There are reasons she served an extra six months. Fighting. Not following the rules. She was found buying drugs in prison more than once. Valium, I believe, among others. You know who she was, Zach, but prison changes people, and it looks like your Alexa made some bad choices there. You don\u2019t know her anymore. Do you really think Grace is safe around a person like that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d Zach said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cAnd with her family history. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the girl you remember, Zach. She spent a lot of time in solitary confinement. She broke a woman\u2019s nose,\u201d Bill said. \u201cShe could actually be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Zach sat back in his chair, sighing heavily. \u201cDrugs,\u201d he said again, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fight her,\u201d Jude said. \u201cWe have no choice.\u201d</p> <p>Bill nodded. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll file our response and let you know when the adequate-cause hearing is scheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hurting them again, Scot,\u201d Lexi said, pacing her lawyer\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Scot said. \u201cI imagine they don\u2019t want to be reminded of ... what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did isn\u2019t the sum total of who you are, Lexi. We\u2019re not even talking about you here. This is about your daughter. You love her, and she needs you. That\u2019s what you have to focus on now. That\u2019s what you can control. The Farradays\u2019 grief is their problem.\u201d</p> <p>She had been ruined again by just seeing Zach. Wanting him made her want to run away again, to hide. How long would she love him?</p><p>\u201cI saw how much Zach loves her,\u201d Lexi said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about him. Or them. Or what you did. It\u2019s about Grace. What does it feel like, Lexi, when a mother turns her back on you?\u201d</p><p>Lexi stopped pacing and looked at her lawyer. \u201cThank you. That puts it in perspective.\u201d</p><p>His intercom buzzed. Scot reached forward and picked up his phone. \u201cHey Bea ... Bill Brein, huh? Okay, thanks.\u201d Hanging up, he opened his desk calendar and wrote something down. Then he looked up at Lexi. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to be strong, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally strong,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting back.\u201d</p><p>Two days later, Lexi was back in a courtroom. Just stepping through the doorway brought a flood of painful memories. So much so that when Scot asked Lexi to dress in black, she said no. She would not re-create that day. Instead, the day before the hearing, she went to the thrift store again and purchased a flared, ankle-length sea-green skirt, a barely worn V-neck sweater that was only a shade or two lighter, and a pair of bronze sandals.</p><p>In her new, feminine clothes, Lexi tried to feel unlike the girl in black who\u2019d once been taken out of a room like this in chains.</p><p>She felt Scot come up beside her. He touched her arm gently.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt herself straightening; the hair on the back of her neck stood up. She tried not to turn, but how could she stop herself? That gravitational pull toward Zach was too strong.</p><p>Lexi\u2019s heart leaped a little at the sight of him. The suit he was wearing was the same one he\u2019d worn to the homecoming dance; now it pulled across his chest.</p><p>Can I kiss you, Lexi?...</p> <p>She looked away from him, tried to forget. She and Scot walked up to the table on the left side of the courtroom; Zach joined his lawyer at the table across the aisle from them.</p><p>The commissioner was the last to enter. He was a portly man with a shiny bald head and rimless bifocals that rested over a veiny, bulbous nose. His bailiff, an elegant Asian man in uniform, smiled brightly as he took his place near the bench.</p><p>The commissioner smoothed his robes and sat down. \u201cWe\u2019re here for adequate cause,\u201d he said, rifling through the paperwork on his desk, finally finding what he needed. \u201cModification of a parenting plan. Mr. Jacobs?\u201d</p><p>Scot stood up, whispering for Lexi to do the same. \u201cMs. Baill is petitioning this court for a modification of the parenting plan. In 2004, Ms. Baill was an ordinary high school senior, in love for the first time, and looking forward to college. Her exemplary grades and academic record earned her a scholarship at the University of Washington. At eighteen, she had dreams of becoming a lawyer.</p><p>\u201cOne bad decision on a summer night changed everything for both my client and the Farradays. Although Zachary Farraday had promised to be the designated driver at a high school drinking party, he failed to keep his word and became inebriated. His twin sister, Mia, also drank all night. And so, tragically, Alexa offered to drive the Farradays home. It was less than a mile away.</p><p>\u201cIn the crash, Mia was killed. At the time, I counseled Alexa to plead not guilty and fight for her freedom, but Alexa is a deeply moral young woman with a profound sense of right and wrong. So she pled guilty and went to prison, hoping her incarceration would help atone for her mistake.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know then that she was pregnant. Originally she planned to give the baby up for adoption, but Zach surprised her by offering to raise their daughter. She was so grateful and so guilt ridden over Mia\u2019s death that she agreed to give Zachary full custody.</p><p>\u201cIn prison, Alexa earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology, and she hopes now to get a master\u2019s degree in social work, so that she can help other teenagers who face difficulties in their lives.</p><p>\u201cShe is a wonderful young woman, and I have no doubt that she will be an exemplary mother to her daughter. The state has a strong interest in reunification of mothers and their children. In this case, it is absolutely clear that my client has substantially changed her situation and deserves to be reunited with her daughter.\u201d Scot touched Lexi\u2019s arm, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and they both sat down.</p><p>Across the aisle, Bill stood up. In the small courtroom, with its dull walls and scuffed floor, he was an imposing figure, with his expensive gray suit and stern profile.</p><p>\u201cThere can be no adequate cause to modify the parenting plan here. Ms. Baill went to Purdy for DUI vehicular homicide. A class-A felony.\u201d He paused, looked meaningfully at Lexi. \u201cPurdy, Your Honor. That\u2019s less than an hour\u2019s drive from Pine Island. She did not have to be cut off from her daughter\u2019s life. She chose not to be a mother. When Zachary Farraday wrote her letters about their daughter\u2014even sent pictures\u2014Ms. Baill sent the envelopes back unopened. She wrote no letters to her daughter and made no phone calls. Throughout the entire duration of her incarceration, she never once attempted to communicate in any way. A former cellmate of Ms. Baill\u2019s\u2014a Cassandra Wojocheski\u2014will testify that Ms. Baill told her point-blank that she never intended to see her daughter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hardly surprising, this lack of a mothering instinct in Ms. Baill. Her own mother was a felon and a drug addict. For all we know, Ms. Baill has a drug problem herself.</p><p>\u201cIn conclusion, we ask that the custody agreement remain in place. Ms. Baill is not a fit parent, and her circumstances are not significantly changed from the time when she voluntarily relinquished custody of her child.\u201d Bill nodded once and sat down.</p><p>The commissioner tapped a pen on the desk.</p><p>Lexi could hardly breathe for anticipation. Bill\u2019s words had loosened a poison in her bloodstream. She could feel it burning through her veins.</p><p>\u201cWe have adequate cause to move forward here,\u201d the commissioner said. He opened the laptop on his desk and made a few keystrokes as he peered at the screen. \u201cWe\u2019ll set a trial date of April 19, 2011. Does that work for counsel?\u201d</p><p>Both attorneys agreed.</p><p>\u201cA year?\u201d Lexi whispered. \u201cThat can\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Scot said sharply.</p><p>The commissioner went on. \u201cUntil then, let\u2019s move on to the motion for temporary order to begin reunification. I\u2019ll appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate the issues and interests herein and to report the finding to this court.\u201d He flipped through some pages. \u201cI\u2019ll appoint Helen Adams. If she has a scheduling conflict, I\u2019ll let the parties know. And now, to the temporary plan. Mr. Jacobs?\u201d</p><p>Scot stood up again. \u201cMs. Baill is seeking immediate reunification with her daughter and asks that a temporary order of joint custody be entered.\u201d</p><p>Bill stood up. \u201cThat\u2019s patently ridiculous. Ms. Baill has no job and no money and nowhere to live. How can she possibly take the responsibility of joint custody for the minor child? Additionally, Ms. Baill has no parenting skills. As I pointed out previously, her own mother was an addict who abandoned her, so Ms. Baill knows nothing about positive parenting. Perhaps after some parenting classes she would be ready to assume some limited custodial care, but not now. Also, we should overlook neither Ms. Baill\u2019s bad behavior in prison\u2014she was repeatedly sent to solitary confinement in 2005 for fighting and drug use\u2014nor the flight risk she poses. Her only family is in Florida. Who is to say she won\u2019t try to take Grace away with her? She\u2019s already shown a disregard for the laws. We submit that there should be no visitation and no attempt at reunification until the parenting plan is modified next year. That will allow Ms. Baill time to show her true desires with regard to parenting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Honor!\u201d Scot said, rising. \u201cThat\u2019s punitive on its face. Ms. Baill does not have a drug problem. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>The commissioner held up his big hand. \u201cI am going to allow supervised visitation between your client and her daughter. Because of the severity of this situation and the extreme separation that has occurred, a professional reunification specialist will supervise every visit unless one of the child\u2019s relatives agrees to be present. Between now and the trial date, this court will receive regular reports from the GAL.\u201d He hit his gavel on the desk. \u201cNext case.\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt that little gavel strike reverberate up her spine. Turning to Scot, she tried to keep a smile on her face for his benefit. He had tried so hard. She didn\u2019t want him to know how the words supervised visitation sickened her. She\u2019d been in that room before, under the watchful eyes of some dispassionate professional; only she\u2019d been the little girl. Now she\u2019d be the untrustworthy mother. \u201cI get to spend time with her, that\u2019s what matters, right?\u201d</p><p>Scot took her by the elbow and steered her toward the side door. Once in the hallway, he led her down to a quiet corner. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. I know you did your best. And I get to see her. Get to know her. I\u2019ll prove to all of them that I deserve another chance. A year is a long time. Maybe by then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe court wants a professional social worker to accompany your visits, someone who specializes in difficult reunifications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like that are really, really expensive.\u201d</p><p>An unfamiliar bitterness welled up in Lexi, left a sour taste in her mouth. \u201cOf course it comes down to money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get started on research. There must be a way around this, but all I can see on its face is to ask one of the Farradays to supervise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up, Lexi. I\u2019ll keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said, slinging her purse over her shoulder. She couldn\u2019t wait to get out of these ridiculously girly clothes. She should have known better. The whole legal system was set up to give people like the Farradays what they wanted. \u201cI\u2019m outta here, Scot. Thanks.\u201d She started to walk away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed her by the arm. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Love my daughter?\u201d Her voice broke on that and she turned away, walking fast.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>Lexi sat on a park bench outside Scot\u2019s office.</p> <p>She knew about giving up. Back when she\u2019d been neglected by her mother, and, later, when one foster family after another let her go, she had tried to stop hoping for more. As a young girl, sitting in a series of crowded government offices, waiting for new parents, she\u2019d stared at the clock on the wall, watching the minutes tick past, thinking with every tiny click that this time she wouldn\u2019t care, this time she would give up her hope, and, without it, she would be invulnerable.</p><p>But it had never worked. For some reason she\u2019d never quite understood, hope was hardwired into her. Even in prison, when she\u2019d stood in lines of women who wore blank, hopeless expressions, she had been unable to become one of them. Even Valium hadn\u2019t helped to dim that small bright part of her. The problem was that she believed. She wasn\u2019t sure what she believed in\u2014was it God? goodness? herself? She had no answer to the question; she knew only that she owned this belief that if she did the right thing, if she always did her best and took responsibility for her mistakes and lived a moral life, she would succeed. She would not become like her mother.</p><p>But she\u2019d done all of that. She\u2019d gone to prison to atone for her mistake. She\u2019d given up her daughter because she loved Grace so, so much. She had tried to do the right things, and yet still she was being thwarted.</p><p>She had the right to see Grace, but not the money.</p><p>How could she take a whole year of living in this community, seeing her daughter, but never being able to be with her? And how could she get a job\u2014as an ex-con with practically no work history or recommendations\u2014that would pay her rent and living expenses and give her enough left over for legal fees and social worker bills? And if she did somehow accomplish all of that, she would spend weekends with her daughter always being judged and scrutinized. How could a real relationship bloom under such dark skies?</p> <p>It would be easier to give up. She could hop on a bus to Florida, where apparently the sun always shone. Once there, she could write letters to Grace\u2014no one could deny her that now\u2014and she and her daughter could get to know each other the old-fashioned way. Maybe in a few years, a visit could be arranged.</p><p>All she had to do was give up. Just concede defeat and get on the next bus.</p><p>Abandon her daughter a second time.</p><p>Just the thought of it made her ill. She remembered all the hours she\u2019d spent in solitary confinement, feeling as if she were draining away in that fetid darkness, wanting to disappear. It had been Grace that pulled her out of all that, Grace who had convinced Lexi to quit tranquilizing herself with Valium and acting out with her fists. Grace who had made her come back to herself. At least, it had been the idea of Grace.</p><p>She got up and went into Scot\u2019s office. Waving at the receptionist, she walked into his office without knocking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no bother, Lexi,\u201d he said, pushing out from behind his desk.</p> <p>She pulled out the one hundred dollar bill Aunt Eva had sent her. \u201cHow much time with Grace will this get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d he said sadly.</p><p>Lexi bit her lip. She knew what to say next, but she was afraid. \u201cThere\u2019s really only one way for me to see my daughter, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Scot nodded slowly.</p><p>Another minute passed. She waited for him to talk her out of it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said after a long silence. Resettling her purse over her shoulder, she left the office. Outside, she unlocked the bike and climbed aboard, riding out of town. Although it would have saved her three miles, she avoided Night Road and went the long way. She didn\u2019t allow herself to think about where she was going or what she was going to do until she reached her destination.</p><p>At the top of the long gravel driveway, she got off her bike.</p><p>The house still looked beautiful against the blue Sound and even bluer sky. The garden was an absolute mess, but only someone who\u2019d seen it before would know that. To the first-time observer, it was simply a riot of color.</p> <p>Lexi held on to the handlebars and guided the bike down the bumpy road. At the garage, she laid the bike gently on its side in the shorn grass and then she walked up to the front door and rang the bell.</p><p>It was funny how that one little action\u2014ringing the doorbell\u2014thrust her back in time. For a split second, she was innocent again, an eighteen-year-old girl, wearing her boyfriend\u2019s ring, coming to her best friend\u2019s house.</p><p>The door opened and Jude stood there. In a black T-shirt and leggings, she looked dangerously thin; her pale hands and feet seemed too big, and bony, with blue veins just beneath the skin. Lavender shadows beneath her eyes aged her, and a line of gray hair ran along her part.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of nerve coming here,\u201d Jude finally said. Her voice was shaking a little, and that vibration helped Lexi gain control of her own runaway nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve, yourself. She\u2019s my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace isn\u2019t here. And the day care won\u2019t let you see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to see Grace,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI came here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jude was growing paler by the second. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>Jude hesitated, and then backed up, whether to let Lexi in or put distance between them, she wasn\u2019t sure; still, Lexi walked inside and closed the door behind her.</p><p>The first thing she saw was Mia\u2019s shamrock green button-up sweater hanging from the hall tree. She drew in a sharp breath and reached for it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch that,\u201d Jude said sharply.</p><p>Lexi drew her hand back.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t stand here next to this sweater she could neither touch nor turn away from, so she walked past Jude and went into the glass-walled great room. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she saw the beach. Just over there, Zach had told her he loved her ... and there, they\u2019d buried their time capsule. Their proof. Their pact.</p><p>She turned her back on the view. Jude was standing by the massive fireplace now, with its roaring fire on this summer day, and still she looked cold.</p><p>Lexi remembered how beautiful and confident Jude used to be, how much Lexi had ached for a mother like her. \u201cYou remember the first time we met?\u201d Lexi said quietly, not moving closer. \u201cIt was the first day of freshman year. I just went up to Mia and asked if I could sit with her. She told me it was social suicide, and I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to remember. I get it. Do you think I do? I can feel her sitting here; I can hear her laughing, saying, \u2018Madre, can you make us something to eat?\u2019 and you laughing, saying, \u2018I live to serve you, Mia.\u2019 I was so jealous of the kind of family you were. The kind of mother you were. I used to dream that I could belong here, but you know that. It\u2019s why you wanted Zach to go to USC. You wanted him away from me.\u201d Lexi sighed. \u201cMaybe you were right. What would I do if Grace fell in love at seventeen? Who knows? It\u2019s so young. I see that now. Too young.\u201d She moved toward Jude, who flinched at her approach. \u201cYou used to be the best mother in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Jude said dully.</p><p>\u201cSo ... you should know how I feel about Grace. Why I need to see her. You, of all people, should understand.\u201d</p><p>Jude drew in a sharp breath and crossed her arms in front of her chest. \u201cGo, Lexi. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford a social worker to supervise my visits with Grace. But I could see her if you would supervise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my house.\u201d</p><p>Lexi closed the distance between them. She could feel the animosity in Jude, but there was also sadness in her, and it was to the sadness that Lexi spoke. \u201cYou love Grace. I know you do. You\u2019re like me\u2014you don\u2019t know how to go forward or backward, maybe, but you remember how love feels. I\u2019m her mother. Regardless of what I\u2019ve done, she needs to know I love her. If she doesn\u2019t know that...\u201d Lexi\u2019s voice finally broke. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt Grace. I swear it. And I\u2019ll stay away from Zach. Just let me get to know my daughter. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>Lexi tried to think of more to say, but nothing came to her. The silence between them grew heavy, and finally Lexi shrugged and walked to the front door, where the green sweater was a sharp reminder of her best friend. Pausing, she glanced back at the great room. Jude hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cMia would have been on my side in this,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>Jude finally looked at her. \u201cThanks to you, we\u2019ll never know, will we?\u201d</p><p>Jude stood there, freezing cold, staring at the closed door, at the blur of green beside it, trying not to feel anything at all. At some point, she became aware that the phone was ringing. Walking woodenly into the kitchen, she picked up the cordless handset and answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone rang and rang,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Jude sighed. \u201cDid it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you having another one of your bad days? I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi was just here,\u201d she said, surprised to hear the words spoken aloud. She didn\u2019t really want to talk about this with her mother\u2014hell, she didn\u2019t want to talk about anything with her mother\u2014but right now, she couldn\u2019t hold back. Her nerves felt as if they were poking out of her body.</p><p>\u201cThe girl who was driving the car that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. That takes some nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told her.\u201d Jude sagged against the wall, feeling depleted by the whole thing. \u201cShe wants me to supervise visitations so she can see Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her no, of course. That\u2019s what I would do.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for her mother\u2019s words to sink in. When they did, Jude straightened. \u201cThat\u2019s what you would do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Jude pulled away from the wall and walked over to the window. Looking out, she saw her mangled, untended garden. It was a heady mix of bright color and dying black leaves. That\u2019s what I would do.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t let that girl hurt you again,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Mia would be on my side in this.</p><p>Her mother was still talking, saying something about grief, maybe, as if she knew what Jude were feeling right now, but Jude wasn\u2019t really listening. She started moving toward the stairs, drifting like a woman caught in a rip current. Before she knew it, she was at Mia\u2019s bedroom door, reaching for the knob, opening it for the first time in years. She went to the closet, opened it, and stepped inside. A light came on automatically, and there it was, just as she\u2019d left it. The box marked Mia.</p><p>A fine layer of dust attested to how long she\u2019d been away. It had taken her years to find the strength to pack up these belongings. And once she\u2019d done it, there had been no strength left to remember them.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Mother,\u201d she said, and hung up the phone, dropping it to the carpeted floor. She sank to her knees and opened the flaps. The mementos of Mia\u2019s short life lay carefully arranged within. Yearbooks. Trophies for soccer and volleyball. An old pink tutu that had once fit a six-year-old. USC sweats. Barbie dolls with no clothes and a pair of scuffed white baby shoes. Everything except the journal, which she\u2019d never found. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pulled each item out, smelling them, holding them to her face. Although she\u2019d cried for years and years, it felt as if these tears were new somehow, hotter; they burned her eyes and her cheeks. At the bottom of the box lay a framed picture of Mia and Zach and Lexi, their arms hung negligently around one another. The smiles on their faces were bright and shiny.</p><p>She could almost hear them laughing ...</p><p>Mia would have been on my side in this.</p><p>Strangely, that sentence brought back Mia as brightly as if she\u2019d just sailed through the door, saying, hey Madre, and laughing. And not the Mia of static memories, but Mia herself, with her megawatt smile and crazy fashion sense and her insecurities.</p> <p>Mia would be on Lexi\u2019s side in this. The thought of her daughter\u2019s opinion shamed Jude to the depths of her soul. Mother had appealed to the worst in Jude\u2014you told her no, of course. Lexi had appealed to the best in her.</p><p>You used to be the best mother in the world.</p><p>The words brought memories surging forward, and Jude was too exhausted, too depleted to hold them at bay any longer. She thought of Mia as she\u2019d been in senior year\u2014a quiet, thoughtful eighteen-year-old girl who had no idea how beautiful she\u2019d become, who\u2019d fallen in love for the first time and had her heart broken by a boy. A girl who loved without boundaries and found joy in simple things\u2014an old stuffed rabbit, a Disney movie, a hug from her mother.</p><p>At that, Jude felt something break inside of her, like muscle tearing away from bone.</p><p>Hola, Madre, how was your day?</p> <p>They\u2019d thought they were fluent, both of her kids, after a year of Spanish. It used to crack Jude up, and they\u2019d known it.</p><p>She sat there a long time, remembering Mia for the first time in years\u2014really remembering her\u2014and in finding the memories of her daughter, she reclaimed a lost piece of herself. And she was ashamed of who she had let herself become.</p><p>Jude had no idea how long she sat there.</p><p>Finally she looked down at her watch, surprised to see that it was time to pick up Grace from day care. In the old days, she would have forgotten her granddaughter on a day like this. She would have spent hours in the closet, perhaps even fallen asleep. Now she went downstairs, found her car keys, and drove over to the Silly Bear, where she parked out front, right on time.</p><p>\u201cHey, Nana,\u201d Grace said wanly when Jude showed up, and it struck Jude suddenly, sharply, what Lexi had said: she\u2019s afraid of you.</p><p>On the short drive to Zach\u2019s house, Jude watched Grace in the rearview mirror.</p> <p>She looked so much like Mia, but for once, it wasn\u2019t the physical similarities that hurt Jude; it was the differences. Mia and Zach had laughed and chattered constantly, exploring their world like a pair of miniature Magellans, confident and happy ... and secure in the knowledge that they were loved.</p><p>Jude parked the car and helped her granddaughter out of her car seat. Grace scrambled out of the car and bounded up to the house.</p><p>\u201cYou want to play a game?\u201d Jude said, coming up beside her.</p><p>Grace looked up at her in obvious surprise. \u201cYou wanna play with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoody!\u201d Grace ran into the house and back to her bedroom. She emerged a few moments later, holding a brightly colored Chutes and Ladders box. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Jude followed Grace to the table.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed quiet today at day care,\u201d Jude said, moving her game piece forward.</p> <p>Grace shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged again. \u201cJake\u2019s mom brought treats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got some.\u201d Grace stared down at the board.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jude said, getting it. \u201cHis mom brought treats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s mom brings stuff sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat back in her chair. How could this possibly surprise her? For eighteen years, she\u2019d been the mom who brought treats. She\u2019d been the party mom, the field trip mom, the constant presence. But she\u2019d never done any of that for her granddaughter. \u201cI could bring cupcakes sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Grace said, not looking up.</p><p>Again, Jude understood. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as a mom, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jude said. For the next hour, she concentrated on moving through the multicolored squares. She kept up a steady stream of conversation, and by the second game Grace had started to talk to her.</p><p>But she knew Lexi was right: Grace was not a happy little girl. Most of her talk was directed to the small mirror on her wrist, her imaginary friend. And why did children create imaginary playmates? You didn\u2019t need to be a shrink to answer that question. It was because they felt too alone and had no real friends.</p><p>Jude was watching Grace so closely she didn\u2019t hear the front door open.</p><p>Zach walked into the cabin, tossing his heavy backpack onto the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Grace\u2019s face lit up as she ran into Zach\u2019s arms. He scooped her up and kissed her all over her face, until she giggled and told him to stop.</p><p>Miles came in behind him, smiling.</p><p>Jude stared at the two of them\u2014the husband she\u2019d loved for so long and practically abandoned and the boy she\u2019d nurtured like a rare flower for so much of his life and then turned away from. She saw the marks that grief had left on their skin, in their eyes, even in their posture, and she knew the part she had played in all of this. She had been the mud that kept them mired in grief. On their own, they might have healed.</p><p>You used to be the best mother in the world.</p><p>Jude stood up. \u201cI need to talk to you two.\u201d</p><p>Zach frowned. \u201cGracie, why don\u2019t you get your coloring book and crayons? I love watching you color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Daddy.\u201d She slid out of his arms and scampered off.</p><p>Jude clasped her hands together. She had their full attention now, but she was afraid to say the words out loud. \u201cLexi came to see me today.\u201d</p><p>Zach went very still. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked at her son. He was a man; young, but a man, and she was so proud of him she could hardly bear it. When in the last few years had she told him that? \u201cShe asked me to supervise her visits with Grace. She can\u2019t afford the court-ordered social worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Miles asked, moving to stand by his son.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t get to know ... her daughter unless I agree,\u201d Jude said, stalling now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zach asked the question again.</p><p>Jude felt the rapid beating of her heart. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she said softly. It was perhaps the most vulnerable she\u2019d felt in years. She was out of control and uncertain and afraid. Usually she hid those emotions away from Zach and Miles, boxed them up; now she didn\u2019t have that kind of strength.</p><p>She moved toward Zach, who had never been afraid when his sister was alive, and never lonely, but now she saw both of those emotions in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Jude said, \u201cbut I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d Zach said quietly.</p><p>\u201cFor Grace and Mia,\u201d Jude said, gazing up at her son. \u201cAnd for you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>Something weird was happening.</p><p>Grace and Ariel were on the sofa, curled up in Grace\u2019s favorite fuzzy yellow blanket. The cabin lights were low and it was dark outside, so she couldn\u2019t really see her wrist mirror, but she knew Ariel was there because she was humming. Ariel loved to hum.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t tell time, but she knew it was late. She never got to stay up this long after dinner, and the movie on the TV had all kinds of bad words in it, and no one cared that she was hearing it. Or that she saw some guy shoot a bad guy in the head.</p><p>No one was paying attention to Grace at all. Daddy and Nana and Papa had been whispering together all night. They\u2019d made a bunch of phone calls and looked at Daddy\u2019s school calendar about twenty times. Grace didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, but Nana kept snapping at Papa, saying things like, I know what you think, Miles, and, What will I say to her? Maybe I\u2019ve made a mistake ...</p><p>Papa said it was too late for that because Lexi knows and the loud whispering had begun again.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lexi?\u201d Grace asked, looking up from the sofa.</p><p>The three grownups stopped talking and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for bed, Princess,\u201d Daddy said, and Grace wished she\u2019d kept her big fat mouth shut. Whining, she shuffled over to her Papa and opened her arms for a hug. He scooped her up and twirled her around, kissing her neck. She clung to him still, giggling as he let her go, and she slipped back down to the floor.</p><p>Grace went to Nana, who stood by the sliding glass door, chewing on her thumbnail. It took a lot of nerve, but Grace said, \u201cNana? Thanks for playing Chutes and Ladders with me.\u201d</p><p>Nana stopped biting her thumbnail and looked down.</p><p>Grace tried to smile, but it wasn\u2019t very good.</p><p>Then Nana did the most amazing thing: she bent down and picked Grace up.</p><p>Grace was so surprised she gasped. She would have hugged her Nana, but it was over so fast Grace barely had time to blink before Nana was whispering, \u201cNight, Gracie. Don\u2019t let the bed bugs bite.\u201d</p><p>It was so weird. Grace sidled close to her daddy and slipped her hand in his back pocket, just so she could be close to him. He plucked her up and carried her down to the bathroom they both used. He helped her brush her teeth and get ready for bed. When she had on her jammies, he put her in her bed and sat down beside her.</p><p>Her room was messy, with toys everywhere, and her Wall-E comforter in a bunch at the end of the bed. Daddy pulled it up carefully, tucking Grace in.</p><p>\u201cAre we gonna read more of The Secret Garden tonight, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Ask him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Grace whispered furiously to her wrist.</p><p>\u201cHow come you\u2019re talking to Ariel when I\u2019m right here?\u201d Daddy said, frowning at her.</p><p>\u201cAriel thinks something weird is happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does, does she? And what does she think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Grace whispered to her wristband, but Ariel had vanished. \u201cI guess she went to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Daddy reached over and unhooked Grace\u2019s wristband.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t she sleep with me tonight?\u201d Grace mumbled. It was an old fight, and she didn\u2019t expect to win, but she had to ask.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules. She sleeps on the nightstand.\u201d</p><p>Her daddy stretched out on the narrow bed, with her big stuffed panda bear as a pillow behind him. Grace snuggled against him and looked up. \u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cWhat, Gracie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lexi?\u201d</p><p>He stopped stroking her hair. \u201cLexi is your mother.\u201d</p><p>Grace scrambled to sit up. This was news. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi is your mother, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Grace said. \u201cIs she a spy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey, she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn astronaut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt bad, but she wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cWhere has she been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been ... busy. I guess those are questions you\u2019ll have to ask her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI get to ask her questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to see you, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d Grace felt a brand-new emotion unfold with her. It was shiny, like tinfoil, and sparkly as a birthday crown. \u201cDid she miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she did,\u201d he answered.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d Grace said again. She tried to imagine what it would be like to have a mommy, someone who would know everything about her and love her anyway. Now Grace would finally be like all of the other kids.</p><p>But why had her mommy left her in the first place? And how long was she gonna stay? What if she didn\u2019t like Grace? What if\u2014</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Grace said, frowning. \u201cHow come you look sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sad, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to see my mommy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said, but she could tell that he was lying. She\u2019d seen him look sad lots of times, but this time he looked worse than sad.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me she doesn\u2019t like, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t like you, I don\u2019t like her,\u201d Grace said, crossing her arms. She could tell that her daddy was hardly listening to her. He was just staring at the picture on the nightstand\u2014the picture of him and his sister sitting on a gray beach log.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to see her mommy. Why?</p><p>And suddenly Grace was scared. She remembered what happened to Allyson in her class last year when her parents got divorced. One day Ally was in class and the next day she was gone to live with her mommy, who moved away. \u201cI\u2019m gonna see her, but I\u2019m staying with you, right, Daddy? Right?\u201d</p> <p>Her daddy said, \u201cRight, Gracie. Of course,\u201d but for the first time in her life, she didn\u2019t believe her dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying with you,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>Lexi had spent the last twenty-four hours on an emotional roller coaster, rising with hope and plunging with fear. Through it all, she planned and organized. She gathered up the shoe box full of letters she\u2019d written to Grace in prison and tied a ribbon around it. Her gift to her daughter. It was all she had.</p><p>And then, she waited impatiently.</p><p>Finally, though, it was time. She climbed onto her borrowed bike and pedaled out of town.</p><p>At the Farradays\u2019 driveway, she slowed and rode cautiously down the gravel road. After parking the bike near the garage, she slung her ragged, out-of-style purse over her shoulder and went to the front door. There, she took one deep breath and rang the bell.</p><p>Jude opened the door almost immediately. Her face was pale, her eyes icy. No makeup added false vibrancy to her face, and without it she looked both younger and older. Her blond hair\u2014in need of a dye job\u2014was pulled back into a severe ponytail, and she was dressed in soft white knit pants and a watery gray sweater. All in all, she looked colorless, a woman made of clouds. \u201cPlease knock in the future. I don\u2019t like the bell. Come in.\u201d</p><p>Lexi stood there, reminded of what she\u2019d done by the look in Jude Farraday\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Jude stepped back to allow Lexi into the house.</p><p>The green sweater caught her eye.</p><p>\u201cOne hour,\u201d Jude said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll stay in the great room.\u201d</p><p>Lexi nodded. Unable to look at the pain on Jude\u2019s face any longer, she moved past her and went into the great room. Sunlight streamed through the windows and seemed to set the exotic wood ablaze. A fire burned in the giant fireplace and sent waves of unnecessary heat into the room.</p><p>At Lexi\u2019s entrance, Grace stood up. The little girl was dressed in a pretty yellow blouse and pale blue overalls. A pair of blond pigtails stuck out above each ear like apostrophe marks.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Grace said brightly. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for my mommy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lexi,\u201d Lexi said nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lexi?\u201d Grace said.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked at her suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re my mommy?\u201d</p><p>Lexi had to clear her throat. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>Grace made a squealing sound and ran for Lexi.</p><p>Lexi picked up her daughter for the second time in her life, holding her so tightly that Grace started to squirm. Sliding down to her feet, Grace grabbed Lexi\u2019s hand and dragged her over to the sofa, where they sat down together.</p><p>Grace snuggled up to Lexi. \u201cYou wanna play a game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we just sit here a minute? It feels so good to hold you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were born, the doctor put you in my arms for the first time. You were so little and pink. Your fist was the size of a grape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did want you,\u201d Lexi said softly, seeing the confusion in her daughter\u2019s green eyes. \u201cI wanted you like crazy.\u201d She offered Grace the shoe box full of letters. \u201cI wrote these letters to you.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned down at the wrinkled letters stacked in the dusty box, and Lexi couldn\u2019t help feeling ashamed, as if her love was as threadbare as her offering. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it isn\u2019t much of a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daddy loved me from the first second he saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s lower lip trembled just a little. \u201cHe says you named me Grace and he named me Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved his sister more than anyone else in the world. Except you.\u201d</p><p>Grace peered up at Lexi. \u201cDid you know her?\u201d</p><p>Lexi heard Jude\u2019s sharp intake of breath. Lexi looked up. Across the room, Jude stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cShe was my best friend in the whole world,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cMia Eileen Farraday. You are so lucky to look like her. She loved practical jokes. Did anyone ever tell you that? She used to put Saran Wrap across your daddy\u2019s toilet seat. And she couldn\u2019t sing at all, but she thought she could, and when your dad told her to shut up, she laughed and sang louder.\u201d Lexi felt something open up inside of her when she talked about Mia. These memories had been trapped for so long, like a dragonfly in amber, but now they were softening. She looked at Jude. \u201cI gave Mia that green sweater hanging in the entryway. It took all the money I made one month, but when I saw it, I knew it would be perfect\u2014it would match her eyes\u2014and I wanted her to know how much her friendship meant to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy never talks about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lexi said, looking down at her daughter again. \u201cIt\u2019s easier that way, I guess. When you love someone ... and you lose them, you can kind of lose yourself, too. But your daddy has had you to love all these years. I want that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think about living with me sometimes? We could get to know each other, and I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d Grace scrambled off the couch. \u201cI am not gonna leave my daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. You said it.\u201d She ran over to where Jude sat and climbed into her lap, coiling around her like a baby monkey.</p><p>Lexi followed. She knelt on the hardwood at Jude\u2019s feet. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grace, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grace twisted around to look at Lexi. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Lexi said.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you leave me?\u201d</p><p>How could she answer that? As she knelt there, staring at her frightened daughter, she remembered being that little girl, confused by a mother who\u2019d never wanted her but sometimes pretended to. The memories sickened her, made her feel pathetic and selfish. \u201cI always loved you, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>Grace jutted out her pointed chin. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Good mommies don\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>Lexi remembered saying the same thing to her own mother, who had burst into tears and sworn that her love was true.</p><p>She knew, better than anyone, that only time could prove the truth of her love. Grace would have to learn to believe her mother loved her.</p><p>\u201cI wanna live with my daddy,\u201d Grace said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI was wrong to say anything. I\u2019ve been ... away for a long time, and I don\u2019t know much about little girls. But I want to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a mommy. You should already know,\u201d Grace said, clutching Jude\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>What could Lexi say to that? She got slowly to her feet and looked down at them. \u201cMaybe I should go. Thank you, Jude,\u201d she said thickly. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t do it for me, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving me again?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d Lexi promised, backing away. In ten minutes with her daughter, she\u2019d done everything wrong. She\u2019d scared Gracie. \u201cNext week, okay? Same day and time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left something on the couch,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Lexi looked back at the stack of letters. They looked small from here, dirty and disheveled in this perfect room. She\u2019d been a fool to think that letters would matter to a five-year-old. Another mistake. \u201cThey\u2019re for Grace,\u201d was all she could manage to say, and then she left her daughter again.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even know I can\u2019t read,\u201d Grace said, her voice heavy with disappointment. She slithered out of Jude\u2019s grasp and got to her feet. \u201cWhen does my daddy get home?\u201d</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t take her eyes away from the battered shoe box on her sofa. It looked absurdly small and out of place against the expensive fabric.</p><p>\u201cNana?\u201d Grace said, stomping her foot for emphasis. \u201cI want to go home.\u201d</p><p>Jude looked up, seeing Grace standing by the fireplace with a mutinous look in her eyes. Her granddaughter was scared, and so she lashed out. It was exactly what Zach would have done at that age. \u201cOkay. But I don\u2019t know when your daddy will be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Grace said, but her voice wobbled a little.</p><p>\u201cYou want a hug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanna see my daddy.\u201d</p><p>Jude sighed. It was hardly surprising that Grace didn\u2019t want to be comforted by a grandmother who\u2019d spent years ignoring her. \u201cGet your things together and we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>As Grace picked up her toys, Jude walked slowly into the living room. For a moment or two, she stared at the shoe box full of letters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Grace said, holding her yellow blanket against her cheek.</p><p>Jude picked up the box and carried it out to the car. She strapped Grace into her car seat and placed the letters in the passenger seat beside her, where now they seemed to take up a lot of room.</p><p>Jude could tell how upset her granddaughter was, and she wanted to soothe the little girl, but too many separate years had left them strangers. Grace didn\u2019t even look to her grandmother for comfort. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be upset, Gracie. Meeting your mom is confusing, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>Grace ignored her, talking furiously to her wrist.</p><p>Jude stared down at her granddaughter for a long time, perhaps longer than ever before, and then slowly, she stepped back and closed the car door. On the way back to Zach\u2019s, Jude tried to start a few conversations, but Grace didn\u2019t answer. The little girl just kept saying, come back, Ariel, I need you, really, and the fervent whispers reminded Jude of years ago, when a little girl who looked just like Grace used to whisper to her brother constantly in a language only he could understand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the cabin, Jude parked and helped Grace out of her car seat.</p><p>She took hold of Grace\u2019s small hand. \u201cHow about if I read you a story?\u201d</p><p>Grace looked suspicious. Finally, she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d slowly, as if she expected Jude to rescind the offer and maybe start laughing.</p><p>They walked silently into the cabin and Grace headed straight for her bedroom. She grabbed the silvery white princess doll that was her favorite and climbed up onto the white spindle bed, wiggling under the colorful Wall-E comforter. \u201cI\u2019m sucking my thumb,\u201d she said defiantly.</p> <p>Jude couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cMaybe I will, too.\u201d She popped her thumb into her mouth.</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re too old.\u201d</p><p>Laughing at that, Jude went to the bookcase.</p><p>A thin white-jacketed book caught her eye. Slowly, she picked it out from among the others and sat next to Grace. Opening the book, she began to read: \u201cThe day Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind or another and his mother called him \u2018Wild Thing\u2019...\u201d The words took Jude back to a room that was full of action figures and plastic dinosaurs, to a little boy who laughed all the time and wouldn\u2019t listen to stories unless his sister was beside him. The memories were close enough to inhale. For a second, she was a young mother again, sitting in the middle of a big king-sized bed with a baby tucked under each arm and a book open in her lap ...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sad, Nana. Why are you crying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI forgot how much I loved this book. It reminds me of my ... children.\u201d It was the first time in years she\u2019d said the tender word aloud. Children. She\u2019d had two.</p><p>\u201cI like it, too,\u201d Grace said earnestly, moving closer to Jude, almost snuggling up against her. For a long time, they sat there, connected as Jude read the story. When she closed the book and looked down, Grace was asleep.</p><p>She kissed Grace\u2019s soft pink cheek and left the room, closing the door behind her.</p><p>In the living room, she found the letters waiting for her, sitting on the coffee table where she\u2019d left them.</p><p>They weren\u2019t hers to open.</p><p>Still, she stared down at the accordionlike array of letters. The envelopes were unsealed; she could see that. Maybe Lexi had wanted to reread what she\u2019d written over the years.</p> <p>She finally picked up the whole box and sat down with them in her lap. She stared at them a long time, knowing it was wrong to read them.</p><p>Just one. To see if this will break Zach\u2019s heart ...</p><p>She pulled out the first envelope in the box and opened it. The letter inside was written on cheap white paper. Gray splotches marred the surface. Tears.</p><p>This letter was dated November 2005. It had taken Lexi a long time to write this first letter.</p><p>With a tightening in her chest that felt a little like the start of a panic attack, Jude began to read. She had read only the first few paragraphs when the front door opened and Zach walked in. He looked nervous, upset.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom,\u201d he said, tossing his backpack onto the floor. It skidded across the hardwood and thunked against the wall. He shoved the hair out of his eyes impatiently. \u201cHow did it go with Lexi today?\u201d</p><p>Had it always been that way, she wondered suddenly? Had he always had Lexi on the forefront of his mind? And if so, how hard had it been to shut those feelings off?</p><p>\u201cListen to this,\u201d Jude said.</p> <p>\u201cCan I listen later? I want to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a letter Lexi wrote to Grace in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man...\u201d Zach collapsed onto the La-Z-Boy chair by the fireplace.</p><p>Jude saw how afraid he was to hear these words, and she understood. It was easier to suppress heartache than to overcome it. At least that was the road they\u2019d both chosen. She cleared her throat and began to read:</p><p>Dear Grace,</p><p>I was eighteen years old when I had you. It seems sort of dumb to say since I\u2019m only nineteen now, but I figured it would be something you\u2019d want to know about me.</p><p>I wish I could forget about you. That\u2019s a terrible thing to say, but if you were old enough to read this letter you\u2019d already know where I am and what I did. Why I can\u2019t be your mother.</p><p>So, I wish I could forget you.</p><p>But I can\u2019t.</p><p>I wake up in this place and the first thing I think of is you. I wonder if your eyes turned green like your dad\u2019s or if they are blue like mine. I wonder if you sleep through the night yet. If I could, I\u2019d sing you to sleep every night. Not that I know any lullabies.</p><p>I fell in love with you before I ever even saw you. How is that possible? But I did, and then I held you, and then I handed you to Zach.</p><p>What was I supposed to do? Have you visit me in this place, have you see me through bars? I know how bad that is.</p><p>I read somewhere that grief can be like breaking a bone. You have to set it right or it can ache forever. I pray that someday you\u2019ll understand that and forgive me.</p><p>I won\u2019t send you this letter, but maybe someday when you\u2019re grown up, you\u2019ll come looking for me and I\u2019ll have this box of letters and I\u2019ll give them to you. I\u2019ll say See? I loved you. Maybe you\u2019ll even believe me.</p><p>Until then, at least, I know you\u2019re safe. I used to dream I was a Farraday. You\u2019re so lucky to have the family you do. If you\u2019re sad, go to Miles. He can always make you laugh. Or ask Jude for a hug\u2014no one hugs better than your grandma.</p><p>And then there\u2019s your dad. If you let him, he\u2019ll show you all the stars in the sky and he\u2019ll make you feel like you can fly.</p><p>So I won\u2019t worry about you, Gracie.</p><p>I\u2019m going to try to forget you. I\u2019m sorry, but I have to.</p><p>It hurts so much to love you.</p><p>Jude looked up at her son, whose eyes were bright with tears. He looked like her boy again, her golden Zach, and in that moment, she remembered the young Lexi, the girl who\u2019d worn her heart on her sleeve and been the best friend Mia had ever had. She remembered the girl from the trailer park who had never known a mother\u2019s love and yet always had a smile on her face. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go well today with Lexi and Grace. Lexi screwed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went too quickly, pushed Grace before she was ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to be a mom. How could she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does,\u201d Jude said quietly. \u201cI remember how overwhelmed I felt by you and ... Mia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a great mom.\u201d</p><p>Jude couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cOnce, maybe. Not anymore, though. I haven\u2019t acted like your mom in a long time, and we both know it. I ... lost that. I thought...\u201d She paused and forced herself to look at him again. \u201cI blamed you. I did, even though I know I shouldn\u2019t. And I blamed Lexi. And myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. We knew better ... that night,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jude felt a searing pain in her heart at the reminder. It was the kind of pain that had always been a barrier before, something from which to retreat. Now she pushed through it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have drunk that night, but Lexi shouldn\u2019t have driven, and I shouldn\u2019t have let you go. I knew there was going to be drinking there. What was I thinking to trust drunk eighteen-year-olds to make wise decisions? Why did I just assume that we couldn\u2019t stop you from drinking? And ... Mia should have had her seatbelt on. There\u2019s blame enough to go around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he said, and although Jude had heard him say it before, she felt the weight of his burden for the first time. It shamed her that she\u2019d been so focused on her own grief that she\u2019d let her son carry his alone.</p><p>She went to him, took him by the hand, and pulled him to his feet. \u201cWe all carry this, Zach. We\u2019ve carried it for so long it\u2019s reshaped our spines, bent us. We have to stand up again. We have to forgive ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked simply. In his green eyes, she saw Mia, too. She\u2019d forgotten that somehow, in her grief; her babies were twins, and Mia would always be alive in Zach. And now there was Grace, too.</p><p>She put a hand on his face, seeing the faint scar along his jawline. \u201cShe\u2019s there ... in you,\u201d she said gently. \u201cHow did I forget that?\u201d</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Lexi-Mommy says, holding out her hand. \u201cYou want to live with me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The hand turns black and long yellow nails grow out from the fingers like hooks, and Grace screams\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Princess.\u201d</p><p>She heard her daddy\u2019s voice and threw her arms around him. He smelled like he was supposed to, and the nightmare faded away until she remembered that she was in her own bed, in her own room, just where she belonged. There were no wild things here.</p><p>Her dad held her close and stroked her hair. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She felt like a baby. \u201cSorry, Daddy,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has bad dreams sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She knew that was true, because when she was little, she used to hear him screaming in his sleep, and she\u2019d go to him and climb into his bed. He never woke up, but he stopped yelling when she was with him. In the morning, he\u2019d smile tiredly at her and say something about how she really should be a big girl and learn to sleep in her own bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me go away, Daddy. I won\u2019t lie anymore. I promise. And I won\u2019t sock Jacob in the nose, ever. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Princess,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cI should have known your mom would come back for you. I should have prepared us both. It\u2019s just ... I tried not to think about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz she\u2019s mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Daddy said, and it scared her, how sad he sounded. \u201cShe\u2019s the opposite of mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she got mean when she was a spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a spy, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know.\u201d</p><p>Grace bit her lower lip nervously. \u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>Daddy shook his head. For a long time, he was quiet. Grace was about to ask something else when he said, \u201cI met your mom in high school.\u201d His voice was weird; it sounded like he had something stuck in his throat. \u201cI would have asked her out on that first day, but she was already Mia\u2019s friend. So ... I tried not to love her ... until one night ... she almost kissed me. That changed everything. I couldn\u2019t stay away from her after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls aren\u2019t supposed to do that,\u201d Grace mumbled around her thumb.</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother would tell you that girls can do anything. That\u2019s what she told my sister, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned. Daddy seemed all ... gooey, and his eyes were shiny. He was acting like he loved Mommy, but that was stupid because he said she didn\u2019t like him. None of this made sense. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t want me,\u201d Grace said. \u201cShe left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes people don\u2019t have a choice about what they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she gonna visit me again?\u201d</p><p>Dad looked down at Grace. \u201cYour mom is really special, Princess, and I know she loves you. That\u2019s what matters now. The reason she\u2019s been gone is ... well, really it was my fault, too. I let her be the one who was wrong. But I was wrong, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWrong about what?\u201d</p><p>He acted like he was going to say something, then he must have changed his mind.

We\u2019re going to work all this out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll stay with me, right, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but she\u2019s your mom, Gracie, and you need her, no matter what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI screwed up, Scot,\u201d Lexi said again. She was in his office, pacing back and forth in front of the window, chewing on her thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cLexi. Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, faced him. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSit down. You\u2019re making me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>She went to his desk and stood there, looking down at Scot, who looked a little tired today. His hair was a mess and his tie was askew. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny has colic. Jenny and I aren\u2019t sleeping much. But I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Lexi reached down for the framed photograph on Scot\u2019s desk. In it, a pudgy bald baby boy held a plastic key. It made her sad, seeing this baby, thinking of Grace, wondering if she\u2019d had colic or if she\u2019d slept through the night like an angel. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about being a mom,\u201d she said quietly, feeling defeated again.</p><p>\u201cNo one does at the start,\u201d Scot said. \u201cI kept looking for a manual with Danny, but all he came with was a blanket. And I\u2019m pretty sure his grandma gave it to him. Sit down, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>She collapsed more than anything, realizing all of a sudden how exhausted she was. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Scot handed her a newspaper. \u201cIt won\u2019t do any good to dwell on your mistake. Now is the time for action, Lexi. We need to show the court, and the Farradays, that you\u2019re here to stay and that you\u2019re ready to parent Grace. The best way to do that is to find a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve circled a few possibilities. I wish I had enough business to employ you here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough. Thank you, Scot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny has a navy blue suit that she thought you might want to borrow. It\u2019s hanging off the door in the conference room.\u201d</p><p>Lexi was once again filled by gratitude to this man, and his wife. She got slowly to her feet. \u201cDanny is a lucky kid. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cSo is Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Lexi said quietly, feeling a thin resurgence of hope. Saying good-bye to Scot, she went into the conference room and put on Jenny\u2019s navy blue summer-weight suit. It didn\u2019t look great with Lexi\u2019s ice blue T-shirt and flip-flops, but it was the best she had.</p> <p>In less than forty minutes, she was on her bike, heading to the local drugstore, which had advertised for a sales clerk. Full time, minimum wage.</p><p>Inside the bright store, with its array of colorful shelving, she paused and looked around. At the nearest cash register, a heavyset woman with a beehive-like gray pile of hair stood, talking on her cell phone.</p><p>Lexi went to the checkout line and stood there.</p><p>\u201cYou buying something, hon?\u201d the woman said, lowering the phone just a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman bent forward, pressed one scythelike red fingernail to the store intercom, and said, \u201cManager to register one, please.\u201d Then she smiled at Lexi, straightened, and went back to her phone conversation.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Lexi said, although the woman wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>Lexi saw the manager approach register one. He was a tall, thin man, very Ichabod Crane\u2013y, with a nose like an eagle\u2019s beak and spiny eyebrows that grew wild as blackberry bushes.</p><p>She moved toward him confidently, extended her hand. \u201cHello, sir. I\u2019m Alexa Baill. I\u2019ve come to apply for the clerk position.\u201d</p><p>He shook her hand. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>She followed him back into a small, windowless office that was stacked high with cardboard boxes. He sat behind the metal desk and pointed to a stool in the corner.</p><p>She dragged the stool over to the desk and sat down, feeling a little conspicuous on the perch.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a r\u00e9sum\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>Lexi felt her cheeks heat up. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a sales clerk job, right? In high school, I worked at Amor\u00e9, the ice cream shop. I\u2019m good with money and even better with people. I\u2019m a good employee, and I can work any shift. I could get you some recommendations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you work at Amor\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom 2002 to 2004. I ... quit in June, after I graduated from high school.\u201d</p><p>He wrote something down on a piece of paper that looked like an application. \u201cAnd you\u2019re home from college now? Is this a summer job for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m looking for full-time employment.\u201d</p><p>He looked up sharply. His thick eyebrows veed together. \u201cYou went to Pine Island High?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost local kids don\u2019t work here full-time. Where have you worked since high school?\u201d</p><p>Lexi swallowed hard. \u201cPart-time in a library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat library?\u201d</p><p>She let out a quiet breath and lost her good posture. \u201cPurdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prison. I\u2019ve been in prison for a few years. But now I\u2019m out, and I\u2019ll be a good employee. I guarantee you that.\u201d She was speaking, but it was useless. She saw the way his face shuttered at the word prison, the way he wouldn\u2019t meet her gaze now.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said, giving her his first smile\u2014and it was pure fiction. \u201cI\u2019ll contact you when we\u2019ve made our decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means no job,\u201d she said, sliding off the stool.</p><p>\u201cIt means I\u2019ll contact you if we want to hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She tried to stay optimistic; it was only the first of many potential jobs. Maybe other employers would be more liberal minded. \u201cSo, do you want my phone number?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her finally. \u201cYou can give it to me if you want.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tell him no way and walk out with some stitch of dignity, but she had Grace to consider, so she wrote down her phone number and left the drugstore\u2019s bright interior. Outside, she opened her newspaper and found the next opening. A waitress position at Esmerelda\u2019s Mexican Kitchen.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, Lexi tried to believe in herself, even as one job after another evaporated in front of her. Most of the available positions were part-time, without benefits. She lost track of the times some employer had mentioned the economy as her enemy. Apparently she\u2019d gone to prison in good times and come out in bad. Minimum wage was less than nine dollars an hour. That gave her maybe fifteen hundred dollars a month income, before taxes; well over half would go to rent.</p><p>But apparently none of that mattered because she couldn\u2019t get a job. She\u2019d spoken to twelve employers today, and every conversation ended up the same way.</p><p>What have you been doing since high school?</p><p>College, really? Where?</p><p>Who was your last employer?</p><p>Oh (and the look)\u2014the prison library.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, the position had been filled ... You\u2019re too young ... I\u2019ll let you know ...</p><p>One excuse after another. The hell of it was, she couldn\u2019t blame them. Who wanted to hire a twenty-four-year-old ex-con?</p><p>And if that weren\u2019t bad enough, after her useless job interviews, she\u2019d checked out housing on the island.</p><p>There were only three apartment complexes, and one thing was sure: she couldn\u2019t afford to live in any of them. The smallest of the available units rented for nine hundred fifty dollars per month. Plus, the landlord required first and last month\u2019s rent and a security deposit in advance. Twenty-four hundred dollars, due on the day she signed the lease agreement.</p><p>It might as well be a million dollars.</p><p>A few phone calls confirmed that Port George was no better.</p><p>There were more rentals available on the other side of the bridge, but they were still way too expensive.</p><p>The whole day defeated Lexi. By the time she gave up, it was seven o\u2019clock at night and she just wanted to be alone. She rode her bike through the quiet summer night and parked outside Scot\u2019s office. Using her key, she walked inside. All she wanted to do was sleep. Or scream.</p><p>\u201cLexi? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and forced a smile. She owed Scot everything; it wasn\u2019t his fault she was such a pathetic loser. \u201cHey, Scot,\u201d she said, heading into his office. \u201cYou\u2019re working late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you. I have a surprise. Come here.\u201d</p><p>He took her by the hand and led her to the conference room. On the long wooden table, a laptop was open. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, \u201csit down.\u201d</p><p>Lexi did as she was told.</p><p>Scot left the room for a few moments and then returned. \u201cOkay, we\u2019re ready.\u201d He pushed a button on the laptop and Aunt Eva\u2019s worried face filled the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Babs. How can you tell if it\u2019s working?\u201d</p><p>The sight of her aunt\u2019s face was like a tonic. Lexi felt a loosening in her chest. For the first time in hours, she smiled. She wasn\u2019t as alone as she\u2019d thought. \u201cHey, Aunt Eva,\u201d she said, scooting forward.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here, Barbara!\u201d Eva\u2019s face broke into a bright smile. \u201cCome look! This is my Lexi.\u201d</p><p>My Lexi.</p><p>A heavyset woman with a head of steel gray curls bent at the waist and peered into the camera, smiling. \u201cHello, Alexa. My sister never stops talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Barbara,\u201d Lexi said softly, overcome with emotion.</p><p>Barbara\u2019s face moved out of view and Eva scooted closer to her computer. She looked different, older; her cheeks were deeply tanned and lined and her hair had gone completely white. \u201cSo, tell me everything, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>Scot left the room and shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cI met Gracie,\u201d Lexi said. It was the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad. Beautiful. Lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That must be hard to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all hard, Aunt Eva. I didn\u2019t want to come here, because I knew it would be hard, but now I\u2019m here and everything is a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve seen your young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Lexi shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a bad day. It\u2019s going to be hard for me to get a job and hard to afford a place to live. Impossible, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just got out, Lexi. Maybe you need to come home and get taken care of. Barb and me got a hide-a-bed just waiting for you. You could get a job down here and save up your money. Floyd at the Tilt-a-Curl says he\u2019d be happy to hire you to answer phones and clean up. Without rent to pay, you\u2019ll have a nice little nest egg in no time.\u201d</p><p>Home.</p><p>Lexi had to admit, the ease of it appealed to her. She needed to be wanted somewhere. \u201cBut how can I leave Grace again? She\u2019ll never forgive me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know how hard it can be on a kid to have a momma who isn\u2019t ready. Take some time for yourself. Get strong and happy and then go back to your daughter. You go back when you\u2019ve got your life together. I think that\u2019s the responsible thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe responsible thing,\u201d Lexi repeated, hating the idea, even as she recognized the truth of it. She would only confuse Grace now. How could she be a mother when her own life was in shambles? Grace deserved better; she deserved stability. Lexi knew about moms who were unreliable. It didn\u2019t make a child feel safe.</p><p>\u201cAlexa?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as brightly as she could. She didn\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. It was breaking her heart. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up with you? Did you ever take those knitting classes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLord, yes,\u201d Eva laughed. \u201cBarbara and me got enough blankets to fill a motel. When you come down here...\u201d</p><p>The view from the forty-second floor was dreary on this wet June day. The Space Needle hovered to her right, a black-and-white disc suspended against a dull gray sky.</p><p>Jude stood at the window, seeing her ghostly reflection in the glass. She was trying to stand still, appear calm, but it wasn\u2019t working. She felt jittery and uncomfortable in her own skin, as if she\u2019d drunk ten cups of coffee on an empty stomach. She chewed on her thumbnail and went back to pacing. Panic lurked just outside her field of vision; she felt it stalking her, a shadow in the corner, waiting to pounce. But she couldn\u2019t pinpoint the source of her fear. She just knew that she was afraid, that she\u2019d been afraid ever since she\u2019d read that letter of Lexi\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Jude,\u201d Harriet said in that strangely even voice of hers. \u201cIt took a lot of courage to face Lexi again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t face her. In fact I tried not to look at her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you did look at her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded, gnawing on her thumbnail now, tapping her foot.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the girl who killed my daughter ... and my granddaughter\u2019s mother and my son\u2019s first love. And ... a girl I used to care about.\u201d Jude scratched nervously at the side of her face. Her skin was crawling suddenly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Dr. Bloom? I feel like I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot crazy. I think maybe you\u2019re ready to try a Compassionate Friends meeting. There\u2019s one today, you know. At two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat talk again?\u201d Jude sighed and sat down, tapping her foot, fisting and unfisting her hands. \u201cI am not going to go sit in a meeting with a bunch of other grieving parents. Should I talk about Mia? Will that bring her back?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a person who hasn\u2019t lost a child. No, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way to get clos\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo help me, God, if you say closure, I\u2019ll walk out. There\u2019s no closure. That\u2019s just a bunch of claptrap. I still can\u2019t listen to music\u2014any music. I still cry almost every time I shower. Sometimes I scream in the car. I talk to my daughter and she can\u2019t hear me. None of that goes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to say that you felt gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I live in the gray. A thick ashy fog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought the rain looked ashy the night Mia died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d</p> <p>Harriet peered at her over the rims of her half lenses. Her point had been made. \u201cSo if you\u2019re still in the gray, I think maybe you should look around. Maybe you can see something now. Shapes. People.\u201d</p><p>Jude stopped chewing her nail. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your pain won\u2019t end, Jude. I\u2019m not a fool. But maybe you\u2019re finally getting ready to accept that there might be more than just pain. That\u2019s why you\u2019re acting like an overbred poodle right now. You\u2019re afraid of feeling, and it\u2019s happening anyway. You opened up enough to let Lexi Baill into your house. That\u2019s a huge step, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read Grace a story and played a board game with her,\u201d Jude said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow did that make you feel?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked up. \u201cLike a grandmother.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. She hadn\u2019t realized that until right now. \u201cI\u2019ve been hard on Zach. I just ... couldn\u2019t look at him without remembering...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemembering is okay, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way I do it, Doc. It ... breaks me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to be broken a little before you can put yourself back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to put myself back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will. You\u2019re on your way, Jude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow your heart.\u201d</p><p>Jude shivered at the idea of that. She\u2019d worked so hard to shut down her emotions; the idea of opening them up again was terrifying. She didn\u2019t know if she could do it. If she even wanted to.</p><p>For the rest of her scheduled hour, Jude tried to listen to Dr. Bloom, but that sense of panic was rising again, drowning out everything except the in-and-out strains of her own breathing. What if she opened herself up again and the pain simply engulfed her? What if she lost all the progress she\u2019d made? It hadn\u2019t been that long ago that Jude had been practically useless, a crying gray form that couldn\u2019t get through the day without drugs.</p><p>At the end of her session, she said something to Dr. Bloom\u2014she didn\u2019t remember what\u2014and walked outside.</p><p>The weather now was both bright and gray. Clouds the color of beach sand hung low in the sky. Sunlight glowed through in places while rain fell in drops so small no local even noticed, but tourists in the market huddled beneath brightly colored umbrellas. She stood at the corner in front of Dr. Bloom\u2019s building, beneath this crying sky, and tried to remember which way to go. It felt suddenly as if any move could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Ma\u2019am?\u201d a kid said, appearing beside her. With shaggy hair and a skateboard clamped under his arm, he reminded her of long ago\u2014or maybe a second ago\u2014when Zach and Mia had been in middle school.</p><p>She would have given anything to run to her car right now, to drive down to the ferry terminal and go home. But she couldn\u2019t. It was Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said to the kid. \u201cThanks.\u201d She moved forward, walking slowly. Rain tapped at her head, occasionally a drop landed in her eye, but she barely noticed.</p><p>In no time at all, she was standing in front of her mother\u2019s art gallery. In windows on either side of the closed door hung large canvases\u2014one was a traditional landscape, the tulips in the Skagit Valley, done in golds and reds, beneath a shadowy, melancholy black sky; the other was a still life, a vase full of pink dahlias. Only on close examination could one see the hairline crack in the aged-looking porcelain.</p><p>Next door, she opened one of the huge glass doors and entered an elegant lobby. Saying hello to the doorman, she headed for the elevator and rode it to the top floor.</p><p>The elevator opened onto the penthouse: four thousand square feet of ivory marble flooring dotted with exquisite, uncomfortable French antique furniture. Floor-to-ceiling windows captured the Seattle skyline, Elliott Bay, and, on good days, Mount Rainier.</p><p>\u201cJudith,\u201d her mother said, coming toward her. \u201cYou\u2019re early. Would you like a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperately.\u201d Jude followed her mother into the living room. The few solid walls in this space were painted a creamy white and supported giant works of art, none of which Jude liked. They were all dark and despairing somehow; sad. Just looking at the artwork in this room had always depressed Jude. Other than the paintings, there was no color anywhere. Jude sat down in a white chair by the fireplace.</p><p>Her mother brought her a glass of white wine. \u201cThanks, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sat down on the pale sofa opposite Jude. She looked ready to host an elegant party\u2014her white hair was coiled with effortless chic into a French twist; her face was expertly made up to emphasize her green eyes and minimize the lines that fanned out around her thin lips.</p><p>\u201cYou look upset,\u201d Mother said, sipping her wine.</p><p>It was a strangely intimate observation for her mother to make. Normally, Jude would have smiled and made up a pretty excuse, but she had been undone by Lexi\u2019s return, by that damned letter, by the obvious pain her son was now in\u2014all of it. She had no strength left, and she was afraid, even though she didn\u2019t know what scared her. Staying put? Letting go? Holding on? Nothing felt safe anymore. And she wanted someone to talk to, someone to help her find a way out. But her mother was hardly that person.</p><p>She wanted to smile and change the subject and pretend she had nothing pressing on her mind, but her whole life was falling apart, it seemed, and she had no strength left for pretense. \u201cWhy is it we never really talk?\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t even know you. And you certainly don\u2019t know me. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>Her mother put down her wine glass. Backlit by the gray day, she looked ethereal. For the first time, Jude noticed how old her mother looked, how tired. Her shoulders were thin as bird bones and her spine had begun to curve forward. \u201cYou, of all people, should understand, Judith.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice was sharp and thin, a razor blade, but the look in her eyes was perhaps the softest expression Jude had ever seen. There was sadness there. Had it always been there?</p><p>\u201cWhy should I understand?\u201d</p><p>Her mother glanced out the window. \u201cI loved your father,\u201d she said quietly, a crack in her voice. \u201cAfter he passed, I knew I had you to care for, and I wanted to care for you, to love you ... but there was nothing inside me. Even my ability to paint vanished. I thought it would last for a day or a week.\u201d She looked at Jude. \u201cIt just went on and on, and when it finally lifted enough that I could breathe, you were gone from me. I didn\u2019t even know how to get you back.\u201d</p><p>Jude stared at her mother in shock. How was it that she\u2019d never made this connection? She\u2019d known that her mother quit painting on the day of her father\u2019s funeral, that she\u2019d walked out of the house and never returned, not really.</p><p>\u201cI watched the kind of mother you became, and I was so proud of you. But I never said that. You wouldn\u2019t have heard me anyway, although perhaps I want to think that. Either way, I didn\u2019t say it. Then I saw you make the same mistake I did: I saw you stop loving Zach ... and yourself. It broke my heart. I would have told you what you were doing wrong, but you were always so sure that I was weak and you were strong. So yes, Judith, you\u2014of all people, you\u2014should understand my mistakes. You should know why I treated you the way I did.\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t know what to say. It felt as if her whole life, her whole identity, had just cracked open.</p><p>Her mother got to her feet. For a second, Jude thought she was going to walk over here, cross the distance between them, and maybe even sit down beside her. \u201cYou\u2019re young,\u201d her mother said finally. \u201cYou can undo this mistake.\u201d</p><p>Jude felt herself starting to shake. Here it was, the thing she\u2019d been afraid of. \u201cHow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPeople think love is an act of faith,\u201d her mother said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s an act of will. I didn\u2019t have the strength to love you, Jude\u2014or to show that love, I guess. I don\u2019t know which it was, and in the end, what\u2019s the difference? You\u2019re stronger than I ever was.\u201d</p><p>In a way, it was the same thing Dr. Bloom had been saying for years. Jude glimpsed the regret in her mother\u2019s gaze, and it was like looking into her own future. She didn\u2019t want to someday be eighty years old and alone. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who can undo a mistake, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not young anymore,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI\u2019ve missed my chance. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the lunches were about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you wanted me to take over the gallery. So we\u2019d have something in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever wonder where the gallery name came from? JACE. Your father named it for all of us: Judith Anne, Caroline, Edward. He thought we\u2019d always be together in it.\u201d Mother sighed. \u201cAnother regret of mine.\u201d</p><p>Jude got to her feet. The trembling in her hands eased; suddenly she felt stronger than she had in months, maybe years. She didn\u2019t know how she would correct all the wrong paths she\u2019d taken, but it was time to start undoing her mistakes. One at a time. \u201cOn Saturday, I\u2019m going to take Gracie to the aquarium. Why don\u2019t you come with us?\u201d</p><p>Mother gave her an uncertain smile. \u201cReally? I could meet you at the ferry terminal. Say 11:00. We could have lunch at Ivar\u2019s after. You and your father used to love throwing french fries to the gulls.\u201d</p> <p>Jude remembered it in a rush: standing by the railing with her parents, throwing fries to the gulls teeming overhead. That\u2019s it, punkin ... kid\u2019s got quite an arm, doesn\u2019t she, Caro?</p><p>\u201cHe loved us both,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Her mother nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s good to talk about him finally.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Jude knew what she had to do. Maybe she\u2019d known for years, but just now, this instant, in the sweet glow of this new start, she was ready to try. \u201cI can\u2019t stay for lunch. I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s something I need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d her mother said. If she was surprised by the sudden change, she didn\u2019t show it. She led the way to the elevator.</p><p>There, they stared at each other for a long time; in her mother\u2019s aged porcelain face, Jude saw the long-forgotten image of another woman, one who\u2019d loved to paint.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Judith,\u201d her mother said softly.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I\u2019ll see you Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Jude left the austere penthouse and returned to the underground parking structure on Virginia Street. From there, she drove out of the dark lot and into a rainy day. Driving carefully, she arrived at the Capitol Hill Community Center. There, she sat in her car for more than ninety minutes, waiting. Every moment she sat there was an act of courage; it would have been so much easier to drive away. That was what she\u2019d done a dozen times before ...</p><p>Finally, a car pulled up and parked in front of her, and then another. Within a few minutes, she could see people going in. Most of them were women, walking alone in the rain, without umbrellas.</p><p>Jude knew how dangerous and frightening this choice was, but she knew how dangerous the other choice was, too.</p><p>Love is an act of will.</p><p>For too long she\u2019d been afraid of it.</p><p>Her hand was shaking as she opened her car door and stepped out into the rain. She fisted her hands and walked across the street.</p> <p>A woman came up beside her. She was young, with flowing black hair and brown eyes that were full of tears.</p><p>Jude fell into step with the woman, although neither one said anything.</p><p>A sign beside the open door read: Compassionate Friends. 2:00 P.M. Grief support group.</p><p>Jude paused, maybe even stumbled. Fear opened up inside her so fast and sharp she couldn\u2019t breathe. It occurred to her to turn and run. She wasn\u2019t ready for this. She didn\u2019t want to do this. What if they wanted her to let go of Mia?</p><p>The woman beside her touched Jude\u2019s hand.</p><p>Jude gasped, turned. She looked at the woman with the dark hair, and now she saw more than tears. She saw understanding. Here was another woman who had empty eyes and a pinched mouth and had forgotten to color her hair. Jude knew this woman knew how it felt to be both filled with pain and achingly numb.</p><p>Is this what I look like? Jude thought suddenly. She did what she\u2019d never done in her life: she reached out to a stranger and held on. Together, they walked through the open doors.</p><p>In the end, it was exactly as it had been in the beginning. No one had a job for an ex-convict with a sociology degree and no real experience. As her prospects dwindled, so did her hope, until by late Thursday afternoon, she knew she was just going through the motions.</p><p>Now, as she sat on her driftwood log at LaRiviere Park, she understood.</p><p>She\u2019d never had a chance, really.</p><p>Lexi closed her eyes at that.</p><p>She knew what she had to do. The hours down here had been a bandage, nothing more.</p><p>It was time. She\u2019d put off the inevitable long enough.</p><p>She walked over to where she\u2019d left her bike and climbed on, pedaling up the hill toward the main road. She bypassed Night Road and circled back to the Farraday house. Holding tightly to the grips, she made her bumping way down the gravel driveway and stopped at the garage. She was shaking so badly it was hard to position the bike near the side wall of the building, and finally she gave up and let the bike fall into the tall grass. She couldn\u2019t help noticing again the runaway garden and remembering how clipped and cared for it once had been.</p><p>Ripples, she thought. Grief had endless consequences. Pushing that thought aside, she went to the front door and knocked quickly\u2014before she lost her nerve.</p><p>Jude opened the door. \u201cLexi,\u201d she said, obviously surprised.</p><p>\u201cI want to give you something for Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s up in Zach\u2019s old room, watching a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see her?\u201d</p><p>Lexi knew she should say no, but how could she? She nodded. Unable to dredge up words to accompany the gesture, she turned away from Jude and went up the stairs to Zach\u2019s old room. At the door, she paused just long enough to draw a strengthening breath, then she knocked on the door, heard a chirpy come in, and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mommy. What are you doing here?\u201d Grace sat up in Zach\u2019s bed, frowning.</p><p>Lexi actually stumbled. She tried to cover her mistake with a smile, but realized that she\u2019d done that badly, too.</p><p>It was a lot to handle all at once\u2014Grace\u2019s beautiful face, her saying, mommy ... and Zach\u2019s room.</p><p>Everywhere she looked, she saw reminders of the boy with whom she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014a tangle of plastic dinosaurs, a football, a colorful collection of Disney videotapes, green-spined video games. But it was the worn copy of Jane Eyre sitting on the dresser that killed her. She went to it, picked it up, felt its slick, crinkled cover ... saw her name, scrawled in a lost penmanship on the inside cover. He\u2019d kept it. All these years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming to take me away, are you?\u201d Grace asked worriedly.</p><p>Lexi put the book down and turned to face her daughter. \u201cNo. May I sit next to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Lexi climbed into the bed (Zach\u2019s bed, but she shouldn\u2019t think about things that didn\u2019t matter anymore) and scooted as close to Grace as she dared. \u201cI scared you the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 scares me. I punched Jacob in the nose and he\u2019s way bigger\u2019n me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said I wanted you to live with me. That wasn\u2019t what I meant to say at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That. You don\u2019t want me to live with you?\u201d</p><p>Lexi flinched. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about being a mom. And I can see how much you love being with your daddy.\u201d</p><p>Grace seemed to relax at that. \u201cDo you know how to make cupcakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. Moms just make stuff.\u201d</p><p>Lexi leaned back against Zach\u2019s headboard. The bulletin board across the room, above the dresser, was still full of newspaper clippings and ribbons he\u2019d won in high school. For what, she couldn\u2019t even remember. \u201cSo I guess you want the kind of mom who makes cupcakes and walks you to school.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed and covered her mouth to stifle the sound. \u201cI live way too far to walk. Samantha Green\u2019s mom makes everyone a cape for Halloween. Do you know how to sew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I pretty much blow in the good-mother category.\u201d Lexi looked down at her daughter, feeling loss yawn inside of her.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had a chipmunk,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI\u2019d let you play with it.\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cThat would be cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy says chipmunks aren\u2019t pets, but I think they could be,\u201d Grace added, laughing. She immediately covered her mouth.</p><p>Lexi gently pulled Grace\u2019s hand away from her mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t ever be afraid to laugh, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>Grace looked up at Lexi through hopeful eyes.</p><p>Lexi knew she would always remember this moment, and if she were lucky, and she didn\u2019t do anything to screw it up, maybe Grace would remember it, too.</p><p>She took the sapphire ring off her finger and offered it to Grace. \u201cI\u2019d like you to have this, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a grownup ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your dad can put it on a chain so you can wear it as a necklace until it fits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as pretty as you are, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my daddy calls me. Why are you giving me this? It\u2019s not my birthday.\u201d</p><p>Lexi swallowed hard. \u201cI need to leave, Grace. I thought. It doesn\u2019t matter what I thought. I was wrong to come here. I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>Lexi couldn\u2019t say it out loud. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can, though. That\u2019s what I want you to remember. And I\u2019ll write every week and call as much as I can. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s lower lip trembled. \u201cI was mean to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d Lexi said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come here. I just ... keep hurting the Farradays ... and I ... Can I have a hug?\u201d</p><p>Grace scrambled over Lexi\u2019s lap and gave her a huge hug.</p><p>Lexi clung to her daughter, trying to physically imprint the memory of this embrace on both of them. \u201cI love you, Grace,\u201d she whispered into her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t you forget that, okay?\u201d She heard Grace\u2019s little hiccup, and the sound pushed Lexi over the edge. She felt the start of tears, and this time there was no holding them back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Lexi wiped her eyes and pulled back just enough so that she was face-to-face with Grace. \u201cCrying is a good thing sometimes. I\u2019ve waited a long time for those tears. You can send me your school drawings, and I\u2019ll put them on my fridge.\u201d Lexi leaned closer and kissed her daughter\u2019s plump little mouth. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll learn to make cupcakes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Grace said. She looked sad and confused and uncertain.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t know how to mend those emotions without making promises she couldn\u2019t keep. Some endings simply couldn\u2019t be what you dreamed. All she could do was make memories now, say good-bye, and hope for a better future. She\u2019d save her money as fast as she could and come back to claim a life with her daughter.</p><p>She kissed Grace one last time and uncoiled herself from her daughter; then she got off the bed and stood there, looking down.</p><p>Grace was furiously whispering at her wrist mirror and trying not to cry.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Gracie. It\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Lexi said, stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she says.\u201d</p><p>Lexi actually managed to smile at that. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky to have such a good friend, but I\u2019ll make you a deal: if you make friends with someone in your class, really make friends, I\u2019ll send some cupcakes in September for the first-grade party.\u201d</p><p>Grace wiped her eyes and looked up at Lexi. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do I make a friend? No one likes me.\u201d</p><p>Lexi sat down again. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t keep punching boys and lying. If you want to make friends, you have to do friendly things. Who is the nicest girl in your class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha. But she never talks to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Tomorrow, you just go up to Samantha and say something nice to her. And you don\u2019t cheat or lie one time. Tell her you like playing with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Lexi promised. \u201cI had a best friend once, and I could tell her anything. She always made me smile. I never felt alone when she was around.\u201d</p> <p>She hugged her daughter one last time and forced herself to walk away from the bed, past the copy of Jane Eyre, touching it once more (it didn\u2019t mean anything that he\u2019d kept it; don\u2019t think otherwise). In the hallway, she paused and looked back.</p><p>Grace sat huddled in the big bed, looking incredibly sad and small.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Mommy.\u201d Grace sniffled.</p><p>\u201cTell your daddy I said ... hey.\u201d She closed the door behind her.</p><p>She should have run from this house as fast as she could. And she would have, if she hadn\u2019t looked down the hallway to Mia\u2019s room. She moved toward it almost instinctively, opened the door.</p><p>The room welcomed her as it always had, drew her in. She went to the dresser, where Mia\u2019s phone lay beside an English lit paper with an A written across the top. A row of plastic Breyer horses lined the windowsill. There were a dozen pictures of Mia\u2014at play rehearsal, at dance class, sitting by the beach with Zach. There were no pictures of her and Mia in the room anymore. Once, though, they\u2019d been everywhere.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t let myself come in here in ... a while,\u201d Jude said behind her.</p> <p>Lexi spun around, her face hot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude reached down for the stuffed puppy on the nightstand, picked it up. Daisy Doggy. \u201cI used to sleep in here. It worried Miles and my therapist after a while, so I closed the door. Erica cleans it, but I don\u2019t come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel her in here,\u201d Lexi said quietly.</p><p>\u201cCan you? You\u2019re lucky then.\u201d</p><p>Lexi moved closer. \u201cShe loved this room but hated that mirror. She always said it looked like an art project. But she knew how much you liked it.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat down on the bed. When she looked up, her eyes were glazed with tears and her mouth was an unsteady line. \u201cWhy did you drive that night?\u201d</p><p>Lexi was actually grateful for the honesty of the question. \u201cI\u2019ve asked myself that a million times. Zach was hammered, and Mia wasn\u2019t much better. Neither one of them could stand up, really. They didn\u2019t want to call you. It was so late, and they were so drunk.\u201d She paused. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to call you. I wanted you to love me so much ... and then Zach got behind the wheel. I couldn\u2019t let him drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did I let you go that night? I knew there would be drinking. And I gave him the keys.\u201d</p><p>Lexi moved toward the bed, feeling like a ninety-year-old woman with rickety joints and watery eyes and sat down beside Jude. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault, Jude. All mine.\u201d</p><p>Jude shook her head slowly. \u201cI wanted to believe that, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to be a little more honest these days. I know you love Grace. Do you still love Zach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to stop. I\u2019ll keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Jude said quietly. \u201cTalk to him. Tell him how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Lexi almost broke at that small kindness. It reminded her of all the conversations she\u2019d had with Jude over the years, all the moments when they\u2019d been like mother and daughter. It was because of Jude that Zach had taken Lexi to the dance, where everything between them had really begun. \u201cThey were so lucky to have you, Jude. And they knew it. Mia loved you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her voice.\u201d</p><p>Lexi slipped off the bed and crawled under it, feeling beneath the slats until she found what she was looking for. Holding it, she crawled back out and sat back on her heels, offering Jude the small pink journal with an orange lily painted on the front.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Jude breathed, reaching out. \u201cHer journal.\u201d</p><p>Lexi placed it in Jude\u2019s hands and then got to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll go now. Tell ... Zach that I\u2019m going to call Grace once a week and I\u2019ll write even more often.\u201d</p><p>Jude stared down at the journal, running her palm over it as if it were a piece of expensive silk. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something important to do before I leave.\u201d Lexi wasn\u2019t even sure if Jude was listening. \u201cA good-bye I should have said a long time ago. But Jude ... love Grace better, okay? She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>Mia\u2019s diary.</p><p>It had been here all this time, waiting. Jude ran her fingertips over the mottled brass lock, and then, slowly, she opened the book.</p><p>Property of Mia Farraday. Private. Keep out. And yes that means you, Zach Attack.</p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p>I\u2019m scared. Is it okay to write that down? I know how lame it makes me look. But you won\u2019t care, right, Diary?</p><p>No one at high school is gonna talk to me. Mom says h.s. will be better than middle school, but she always says stuff like that. How would she know what it\u2019s like to be me? She was a cheerleader and probably Homecoming Queen. What would she have done if Maribeth Astor called her pizza face?</p><p>I wish I hadn\u2019t cried. That just made everything worse.</p><p>And now I\u2019ll probably have to sit by MB in class.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>It used to be easy for me. So, like, what happened? In grade school I had lots of friends. Well, so, okay, maybe they were Zach\u2019s friends, but we all played together and I didn\u2019t know there was something wrong with me. Now I know. Boy do I know.</p><p>Madre is calling us for breakfast. The most important meal of the day. Yeah, right.</p><p>Loser out.</p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p>You won\u2019t BELIEVE what happened today. Ok I\u2019m gonna write it all down so I don\u2019t forget anything.</p><p>First of all, Mom was wrong about h.s. At least at first. I walked into school with Zach, and even though he was holding my hand, it was like I was invisible. Okay maybe I shouldn\u2019t have worn the pink tutu and high tops, but I\u2019m not like those other girls. They know and I know it. The clothes help keep them away. And so what if they laugh?</p><p>Lunch was a horrorfest. I walked into the lunch room and almost puked. No one made eye contact with me. Zach was sitting with all his Barbie and Ken friends and he waved me over. No way I was gonna go there, so I took my book and went outside.</p><p>That\u2019s when it happened Diary!</p><p>I was sitting on the grass by this scrawny tree, chewing and reading (Wuthering Heights) when this girl just walked up and said can I sit with you.</p><p>I told her it was social suicide and she smiled. Smiled. Then she sat down and we started talking and Diary, we have like EVERYTHING in common.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to jinx it but I think she wants to be my friend ...</p><p>How cool is that???</p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p>Lexi stayed the night at my house last night. We totally fooled Madre and pretended to go to sleep at 11 but then we snuck out and went down to the beach. We sat there for hours, talking, about EVERYTHING. She likes me, and she doesn\u2019t care that no one else does. We are gonna be Harry and Hermione. Friends forever.</p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p>Lexi made me try out for the school play, Once Upon a Mattress. And I GOT THE PART!</p><p>What would I do without her?</p><p>Tod Lymer asked Lexi to the dance. She tried to keep it a secret, but high school is such a soap opera. No one can really keep a secret. Besides, Haley wanted me to know. She laughed when she told me and called me a loser who couldn\u2019t get a date.</p><p>How does Mom always know when something is wrong? When I got home from school, she took one look at me and just walked over and hugged me. I tried to push her away, but she held on, and I burst into tears. Yes, Diary, that\u2019s how cool I am. When I was done telling her the story, she said I needed to remember that good friends wanted the best for each other, and I should remember that.</p><p>I do, Diary. I do want Lexi to be happy. Totally I don\u2019t care at all if she goes to the stupid dance.</p><p>Lexi didn\u2019t go to the dance. She said she\u2019d WAY rather stay home with her best friend and watch movies, so that\u2019s what we did. We made popcorn and watched movies. Zach even stayed home with us. He said any dance without us was a total waste of</p><p>\u201cNana?\u201d</p><p>Jude looked up and saw her granddaughter standing by the bed. In her pink terrycloth sweats, with her curly blond hair a mass of tangles, she looked exactly like Mia at that age, and it disoriented Jude just a little. For the first time in years, Mia felt close enough to touch. The diary had brought her back to Jude.</p><p>Grace burst into tears. \u201cM-my m-mommy left.\u201d</p><p>Love Grace better. She needs you.</p><p>Jude got out of bed and scooped Grace into her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d she whispered, and then suddenly Jude was crying, too. She clung to Grace, crying against the child\u2019s soft, plump cheek, smelling the sweet baby shampoo scent of her hair, remembering ...</p><p>\u201cI tole her I wanted to st-stay with Daddy,\u201d Grace said sobbing. \u201cAn I do wanna be with Daddy, but ... but I want my mommy, too. I shoulda told her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grace.\u201d Jude looked at her granddaughter through a blur of tears. In the soft focus, she saw not only Grace, but Zach and Mia, too. And the Lexi who had been a part of them. They were all in Grace\u2019s face, in her eyes, in the pink bow of her mouth. How had Jude forgotten that?</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t forgotten it. She\u2019d known it all along; she\u2019d looked away from it purposely, afraid that the pain would kill her. But not feeling had taken away her joy, too, left her in that gray haze of numbness.</p><p>In a way, they were all together again in this moment, embraced in one another\u2019s arms just as they would have been if Mia were alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She carried Grace up onto Mia\u2019s big bed and snuggled with her there.</p><p>Grace slowly opened her small fist. Resting on her palm lay the promise ring Zach had given Lexi. \u201cLook what Mommy gave me.\u201d</p><p>Jude picked up the fragile ring. This was what she\u2019d been so upset by all those years ago, a little circle of white gold with a sapphire chip; she\u2019d thought a ring like this could derail a young man\u2019s life. \u201cHe was so romantic,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>Grace popped her thumb in her mouth and mumbled, \u201cWho?\u201d around it.</p> <p>\u201cYour daddy. I should have known that Miles and I would raise a romantic.\u201d</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she rejoiced that her son knew how to love deeply? And to dream of the future. Why was it that pebbles looked like boulders until they were in your rearview mirror? \u201cHe gave your mommy that ring for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Jude unhooked the slim gold chain necklace she wore. Letting the diamond enhancer fall into her lap, she took the ring from Grace and threaded the chain through it and then clasped the necklace on Grace. \u201cYou look like a princess,\u201d Jude said, kissing her granddaughter\u2019s cheek. And once she\u2019d begun kissing Grace, she couldn\u2019t stop. She kissed and nuzzled and snuggled until Gracie cried out for mercy, yelling stop it, Nana\u2014that tickles! and giggling.</p><p>Finally Jude drew back and looked at Grace. \u201cI love you. I should have told you that a million times a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of times.\u201d Grace giggled again and covered her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to quiet your laughter, Gracie. It\u2019s a beautiful sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mommy said.\u201d</p><p>Mommy.</p><p>How was it that an ordinary word, one she\u2019d heard all of her life, could suddenly be so sharp? You used to be the best mother in the world.</p><p>Regret was all around Jude; she felt choked by it, but then she looked down at the girl in her arms, and she could breathe again. The regret melted slowly away, was replaced by a fragile shoot of hope. \u201cYour mom has a heart as big as Alaska. I forgot that. And she made my Mia\u2014and your dad\u2014happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Grace asked, pointing at the book in Jude\u2019s other hand.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t even realized she was still holding it. \u201cIt\u2019s your Aunt Mia\u2019s diary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t \u2019posed to read stuff like that. Hannah Montana says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCuz she\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Jude drew in a sharp breath, waiting for a pain that didn\u2019t quite come. It was there, of course, in that one awful word, but it left quickly, and she was surprised to find that she could still smile. And maybe it was better to face a thing, to say it out loud, rather than to hide it away. \u201cYeah. Now it\u2019s something she left for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she like, Nana?\u201d Grace asked, and Jude wondered how long Grace had held that question back, afraid to ask it of anyone in her family.</p><p>\u201cShe was like ... a beautiful, fragile flower. Until she met your mom, she was afraid of her own shadow and lonely ... so lonely.\u201d She wiped her eyes. \u201cShe wanted to be an actress, and I think she could have made it. All those quiet years weren\u2019t wasted. Mia was always watching people, soaking up the world around her. When she got onstage, she was a different girl completely. Your mom helped her with that. It was Lexi who talked Mia into trying out for her first play.\u201d</p><p>Miles appeared in the doorway. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? You two look like you\u2019re having a party without me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are, Papa!\u201d Grace said, scrambling to her feet. She ran across the bed and launched herself into Miles\u2019s open arms.</p><p>\u201cNana was telling me about Aunt Mia,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAn\u2019 look what my mommy gave me.\u201d She held out the promise ring on the chain.</p><p>\u201cShe was telling you about Mia?\u201d Miles asked, looking at Jude. Over Grace\u2019s golden hair their eyes met, and a quiet understanding passed between them. They both knew what it meant to simply say Mia\u2019s name. He got up into his daughter\u2019s bed and eased close to them, putting an arm around Jude.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been so strong?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cStrong?\u201d He sighed, and in the sound she heard the wellspring of his loss. \u201cI\u2019m not strong anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, thank God, I\u2019m patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Grace wiggled around until she was wedged between them. Then she sat up. Her pointed chin jutted out. \u201cWon\u2019t Daddy be mad that Mommy gave me this ring?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly Jude got it: she knew why Lexi had given Grace the ring. Something important to do before I leave.</p><p>Lexi hadn\u2019t just left Grace for the day. The ring meant good-bye.</p><p>Lexi pedaled up Main Street and parked her bike in front of Scot\u2019s office.</p><p>He was still at his desk, talking on the phone. At her entrance, he smiled and held up a finger. Wait, he mouthed. Don\u2019t go.</p><p>She sat down on the sofa in the office, waiting. As soon as he hung up, she got to her feet and headed toward the desk. \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d she said, standing in front of him.</p><p>He paused in gathering his papers and looked up. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what Grace said to me? I\u2019m already a mom. I should know how to be one. But I don\u2019t. I have no idea how to be my daughter\u2019s mommy. I don\u2019t have a job or a place to live. Anything. I\u2019m not ready. All I did by coming back was hurt them again. Hurt Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi, you can\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to give up. I still want to modify the custody agreement, and I want to be Grace\u2019s mom. I want that more than anything. But I have to do it the right way. I have to do what\u2019s best for her. Not what\u2019s best for me.\u201d Her voice fell away; all she could do was shrug. \u201cI tried to find a job. Ha. Apparently a twenty-four-year-old ex-con can\u2019t even be a part-time janitor. And forget about housing. At best I can rent a room in someone\u2019s house. I\u2019ll have to work seventy hours a week just to live. How do I take care of Grace? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t make it harder, okay? I appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me, but I\u2019m going to Florida tomorrow morning. Eva got me a job. I\u2019ll be able to save up enough to come back in a year. My bus leaves at 9:25.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lexi...\u201d Scot said. \u201cI wish you\u2019d listen to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure they send me pictures,\u201d she said quietly, trying not to cry. \u201cI\u2019ll write to her every week.\u201d</p><p>He went to her then, took her in his arms. She had a hard time letting go. \u201cThank you for everything,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Zach?\u201d Scot asked.</p><p>The question hurt so much she didn\u2019t even try to respond.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a ride to the bus station tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The last thing she wanted was to tell him good-bye again. \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. I left Jenny\u2019s suit in the conference room. Tell her thanks for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can tell her yourself. Come to dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but there\u2019s something I have to do later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to do it alone.\u201d</p><p>Jude sat on the sofa in Zach\u2019s quiet living room. She hadn\u2019t bothered turning on any lights, so the lavender evening crept through the windows. A fire danced orange in the black hearth, and for once she felt warmed by it. Every now and then she heard a giggle coming from down the hall, where Miles and Grace were playing something on the Wii. Grace was like a light that had suddenly been switched on; she talked nonstop, and she hadn\u2019t told a lie all afternoon. Jude had no doubt that the last few hours with her granddaughter would become one of the anchor memories of this new part of their family\u2019s life. The start of After.</p><p>But even as she\u2019d joined in, Jude had felt a rising sense of urgency. There was more to be done, she knew, more wrongs to right.</p><p>Finally, at about seven, the front door opened and Zach walked in, with his heavy backpack hanging off one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Jude said, rising to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThe last test was a bitch,\u201d he said, tossing his backpack. He looked utterly exhausted. \u201cI think I blew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot on your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried calling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy phone died. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>She got up from the sofa and stood there, staring at him. Even now, she wasn\u2019t sure quite how to say all the things on her mind. The last few days had been so startling; she felt like a glacier that had begun slowly to melt and move again.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by the lawyer\u2019s office, too,\u201d he said, meeting her gaze. \u201cI agreed to the modified parenting plan. It\u2019s done. I know you don\u2019t like it, but I can\u2019t hurt Lexi anymore. I won\u2019t. And if she needs to have Grace by herself for a while, I\u2019m going to say yes.\u201d He paused, and then said quietly, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gotten drunk. If I had stayed sober\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Zach, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run this thing, Mom. I know how much you care about everything, but this is about me and Lexi and Grace. I have to do what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. It was time. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>They were like soldiers who\u2019d fought on a common battlefield, she and her son. There were things to say, but they were just words, and they would come in time. What mattered was that they had survived and that there was still love\u2014between them and around them. Everything else was a postscript. There was really only one thing she needed to say to him now. One question to ask. \u201cDo you still love her?\u201d</p><p>Zach seemed to crumble at that. In his eyes, she saw both a fragile youth and a terrible maturity. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved her. I never even tried not to.\u201d</p><p>She gathered her son in her arms and held him as she should have years ago, when he was young and hurting and afraid. She wished she\u2019d known then what mattered most. \u201cI love you like air, Zach.\u201d</p><p>He held her tightly. \u201cI love you, too, Madre.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time he\u2019d called her that in years, and with that little endearment, she melted more, moved just that much closer to who she\u2019d been. She drew back slowly. \u201cI think she\u2019s leaving tomorrow. Going to Florida maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks Grace will be better off without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLexi has always tried to do what was right for everyone else. That\u2019s who she is, isn\u2019t it? I should have remembered that, Zach ... how much Lexi meant to us ... to me.\u201d</p><p>Zach looked at her. She saw both hope and worry in his eyes: hope that she meant it and worry that she didn\u2019t. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo find her, Zach. Tell her how you feel.\u201d She pushed the hair from his eyes and smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of our family. She needs to know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t care, Mom.

We just ... forgive. I used to worry that you and Lexi were too young for love, and I still think of you as young, but you\u2019re not, are you? None of us are, and life doesn\u2019t take the straight road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Zach gave her a hug and then hurried out of the cabin. She was still in the open doorway, staring up the empty driveway when she felt Miles come up beside her.</p> <p>He put an arm around her. \u201cHe went to find Lexi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange comes fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can.\u201d She turned into him, slipped her hands around his waist, and gave him a kiss.</p><p>It was a quiet miracle, really, the durability of their love.</p><p>\u201cNana, Papa!\u201d Grace slipped between them like a little eel. \u201cLet\u2019s play Candy Land. Nana can be Princess Frostine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour Nana doesn\u2019t play\u2014\u201d Miles started.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to play Candy Land again,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>It was strange how a sentence could free something inside of you\u2014such a little thing.</p><p>They sat around the coffee table, in front of the fire. With the board set up, they played and talked and laughed. They were finally putting it away when the front door burst open and Zach walked in.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find her,\u201d he said, looking miserable and pissed off. He tossed his car keys on the entry table. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to look.\u201d</p><p>Grace ran to him and he picked her up, kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy. Look what my mommy gave me.\u201d She held out the ring.</p><p>Jude thought her son was going to crumple to his knees right there. \u201cThe promise ring,\u201d he said, letting Grace slide down to the floor. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want it anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the window, stared out at the dark Sound. \u201cWhere could she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Grace said, coming up beside him, putting her hand in his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cI looked at the park, at that place in the woods by her old trailer. I looked in every window downtown. I even went to the cemetery and the ... place on Night Road. It\u2019s like she vanished.\u201d He turned to Jude. \u201cDid she say anything?\u201d</p><p>Jude tried to remember. She\u2019d been so focused on the journal, she\u2019d barely been listening to Lexi. Another mistake to atone for. \u201cI think she said something about a last good-bye. Something she should have done a long time ago. I should have stopped her. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good-bye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. She said she had one last thing to do. A good-bye she should have said a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Zach grabbed his keys and ran out of the house.</p><p>Lexi tried to wait until midnight, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She was anxious, sick to her stomach about what she had to do. Finally, at about nine-thirty, she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She left Scot\u2019s warm, love-filled home and rode the bicycle out to LaRiviere Park. There she stood at the water\u2019s edge. The sound of waves whooshing forward, reaching for her and receding, would forever remind her of first love. But finally, it was time to go.</p><p>She walked the bike up the hill and pedaled onto the main road. Even this late on a summer\u2019s night, Main Street was full of people milling about, and Lexi dodged between and around them with the ease of a local girl in a tourist town. A faded melancholy assailed her as she passed the places that would forever define her youth. She would always remember the girl she\u2019d been on this Main Street, the girl who laughed with her best friend and waited for a boy in a white Mustang.</p><p>On Beach Drive, she slowed down and coasted up to the Farradays\u2019 driveway. Hiding her bike in the salal, she stayed close to the tree line until she was close enough to see that the house lights were off.</p><p>No one was home.</p><p>Breathing a sigh of relief, she walked down the driveway and around the side of the house.</p><p>Night claimed the backyard. A single porch light glowed above one of the doors, splashed light onto the glittery gray stone patio. Moonlight illuminated the waves and turned the grassy lawn blue.</p><p>She eased past the barbeque area and around the pair of chaise loungers that overlooked the Sound. Flicking on her borrowed flashlight, she pointed a beam of yellow light toward the giant cedar tree that guarded this bit of land from the encroaching water.</p><p>At the base of the tree, she scanned the ground with her flashlight, wondering exactly where she should dig first.</p><p>\u201cWe should have used a marker,\u201d she said to the ghosts of the kids they\u2019d been.</p><p>It\u2019ll be a pact.</p><p>We\u2019ll always be friends.</p><p>Never say good-bye.</p><p>They should never have buried the stupid Thermos, should never have let themselves get so caught up in nostalgia.</p><p>Or maybe she simply shouldn\u2019t have remembered it. Who could have known how heavy a pact could become, how precise a promise could seem?</p><p>She dropped slowly to her knees, feeling the shock of cold sand on her bare skin. She dug through the sand, pushing mounds of it to one side and then the other.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>She dug faster, feeling desperation rise. She had to dig this up, had to say good-bye to Zach ...</p><p>\u201cIs this what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>She heard his voice in the darkness, and when she looked up, there he was, standing at the edge of the trees. She must have walked right past him ...</p><p>\u201cI guess you beat me to it.\u201d She got awkwardly to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt stays. Just like the promise we all made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat promise died in a car on Night Road,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid it?\u201d He moved toward her slowly.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me, Zach. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Words were impossible with him this close. She started to turn away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t know what those words did to her. \u201cDon\u2019t, Zach. It\u2019s too late. I can\u2019t take it again. Just ... let me go. Say good-bye. Throw the Thermos in the Sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her,\u201d he said, and Lexi felt the start of tears.</p><p>How was it they had never had this conversation? She started to say how sorry she was, but he shook his head and said, \u201cBut I miss you, too, Lexi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach...\u201d She could barely see him through her tears now, but she wouldn\u2019t wipe them away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you could forgive me ... I can\u2019t forgive myself, and I\u2019ll get it if you hate me. But Lex ... oh, man ... I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sorry? I killed your sister.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. She saw how uncertain he was, how afraid. \u201cCould you ever love me again?\u201d</p><p>She stared at this blurry version of him, shadows and moonlight, and remembered the first time he\u2019d kissed her, the first time he\u2019d held her hand, the day he\u2019d stood up in court and said he was guilty, too, the day he\u2019d taken their daughter in his arms. It was all between them in this instant\u2014the good, the exceptional, the sad, the horrific. Everything that they\u2019d been as kids and the adults they were trying to now be. She could no more deny loving him than she could carry weights into the Sound and drown herself. Some things simply were in life, and her love for him was one of those things. It didn\u2019t matter that they were young or that there were a dozen reasons for them to be apart. It only mattered that his blood had somehow found its way into her veins and without him she was lost. \u201cI do love you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI tried to stop...\u201d</p><p>He took her in his arms and kissed her. At the touch of his lips, so sweetly, achingly familiar, she felt as if her soul, bound in chains for years, broke free, stretched and opened its wings. She was flying, soaring. She clung to him, crying at last for the best friend she\u2019d killed and the years she\u2019d lost in prison and the daughter whose babyhood would forever be hidden from her. This moment was more than she\u2019d ever dared to hope for, and the love she\u2019d tried so hard to extinguish overwhelmed her.</p><p>She drew back and stared at him in wonder. Tears spiked his lashes, made him look impossibly young again, like the boy she\u2019d given her heart to all those years ago on a night like this, with the lights of the highway rushing past them. \u201cHow?\u201d was all she could say, but she knew he understood. How could they go back, really?</p><p>\u201cI love you so much, Lexi,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what do we do? How do we start?\u201d</p><p>He handed her the dirty Thermos as carefully as if it were an artifact from a lost civilization, which, in a way, it was. \u201cWe keep our promise.\u201d</p><p>Lexi held the time capsule in her hands, picturing the gold earrings, the Saint Christopher medal, and the fraying friendship bracelet within.</p><p>Lexi felt Mia with them\u2014in the warm summer breeze, in the rustling of the trees, in the steady heartbeat of waves. She kissed the sandy curve of the Thermos and buried it again. When she was done, she patted the sand in place. \u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d Lexi said, feeling her best friend beside her for the first time in years.</p><p>Zach finally smiled. \u201cShe always will be.\u201d</p><p>Then he took her hand and they stood up. \u201cCome home with me, Lexi,\u201d he said, and all she could do was nod. Home.</p><p>They walked quietly toward the house, and she thought: this is how we do it; this is how we talk to our daughter. Holding hands.</p><p>The next morning, Grace woke up early. In her footed pink jammies, she walked sleepily down the narrow hallway to her daddy\u2019s bedroom, dragging her yellow blanket along behind her.</p><p>His door was closed. That was weird. She pushed the door open and started to say, Wake up, sleepy head, but all she got out was, \u201cWa\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mommy was in bed with Daddy. They were kinda stuck together, sleeping.</p><p>Grace got a little flutter in her heart.</p><p>Her mommy was here.</p><p>She shuffled forward and climbed up on the bed, squirming between them. Before she could say anything, her daddy started tickling her, and she giggled until she couldn\u2019t breathe. Then she lay there, between her mommy and daddy, feeling like crying even though she didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with me being here, Gracie?\u201d her mommy asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daddy changed my mind,\u201d Mommy said. \u201cIs that okay with you, Grace? Can I live with you guys?\u201d</p><p>Grace giggled at that. She felt so happy she forgot to cover her mouth. \u201cOf course it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>After that, Grace had a lot to tell her new mommy. She talked nonstop until the alarm beside Daddy\u2019s bed rang; then she sat up suddenly and said: \u201cI gotta go to school. It\u2019s the last day. Will you drive me, Mommy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drive,\u201d her mom said, looking nervously at Daddy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d Grace said. \u201cAll mommies know how to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my license back,\u201d Mommy said. \u201cBy first grade, I\u2019ll be ready. Now, how about breakfast? I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>Grace launched herself onto Daddy\u2019s back, and Daddy carried her into the kitchen, plopping her down in her seat at the table.</p><p>All the time she was eating, she couldn\u2019t help staring at her mommy. She could tell that Daddy couldn\u2019t help himself either. It felt like being a family.</p> <p>And Grace could think of a lot more to say to her mommy now. Through breakfast and out to the car, Grace talked. She told Mommy about how bendable Barbie was and how cool Hannah Montana and Cinderella were and how long she could hold her breath, and before she knew it, she said, \u201cAn I c\u2019n waterski like Ashley Hamerow.\u201d</p><p>They were in the car now, driving to school.</p><p>Mom turned in her seat and looked at Grace. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is it?\u201d</p> <p>Grace slumped in her car seat. \u201cNo.\u201d It was hard to only tell the truth. How would anyone like her for who she really was?</p><p>At school, Dad pulled out of the carpool lane and parked under the big trees off to the side of the school.</p><p>\u201cCan I walk you into class?\u201d Mommy asked.</p><p>Grace got that fluttery feeling again. She smiled. \u201cYou could be my show and tell.\u201d</p><p>Mommy smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>They walked through the crowd of children, and Grace started to feel sick. Mommy was gonna notice that she had no friends.</p> <p>But all the way to the classroom door, Mommy held her hand, and when they got there, she knelt down and looked at Grace.</p><p>\u201cYou remember when I told you about my best friend, Mia?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. She wanted to suck her thumb, but the kids would just make fun of her for that.</p><p>\u201cI was so scared the day I met her. It was the first day of school, and no one liked me. I ran out of the lunchroom \u2019cause I couldn\u2019t sit with anyone. And then I saw this other girl sitting all by herself. And I just went up to her and started talking. That\u2019s how we became best friends. You have to take a chance, Grace. Talk to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>Mommy pulled Grace into a fierce hug and kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be here to pick you up when school\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d her mommy said, and then she backed away.</p> <p>Grace looked nervously into the classroom, where kids were busy doing all kinds of things. She saw Samantha standing by the cubbies, all by herself. \u201cAriel? Are you here? I need you.\u201d</p><p>Go on.</p><p>Grace looked down at her wrist; she saw a flash of yellow and heard a sound that was like laughing, or maybe like the waves in front of Nana\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat should I say?\u201d</p><p>You know what to say. You don\u2019t need me anymore, Gracerina.</p><p>\u201cI do! Don\u2019t go.\u201d Grace started to panic. Her cheeks got hot. She was afraid she was gonna cry.</p><p>Go on, Gracerina. You have your mommy now. Trust her.</p><p>Grace looked at her mom one last time and then walked into the classroom.</p><p>Her heart was beating like crazy. Taking a deep breath, she walked over to Samantha and just stood there beside her. \u201cMy mommy came home last night,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>Samantha turned to her. \u201cThe spy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not really a spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is she?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna sit by me today?\u201d Grace said, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna punch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like hopscotch?\u201d Samantha finally said. \u201cCuz I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Grace said, smiling. It was a lie. Really, she didn\u2019t know how to play hopscotch, but she wanted to learn. And anyway she didn\u2019t think it was a bad lie. \u201cI love hopscotch.\u201d</p><p>The day woke Jude gently. She lay in bed with Miles, feeling his body along hers, hearing the catch in his breathing that meant he would soon start snoring.</p><p>She kissed his stubbly cheek and peeled back the covers to get out of bed. Through her bedroom windows, she saw a brilliant salmon-pink sky glowing above the steel blue Sound, and, for the first time in years, she went in search of a camera.</p><p>Standing outside in her terrycloth robe and bare feet, she took several pictures of the black cedar tree silhouetted against the pink sky. It looked new to her all of a sudden. Dew sparkled on the dense green lawn and on the stone patio. She thought about the parties they used to have in this backyard, the laughter that used to fill it, and she hungered for a time like that again. She\u2019d bought that huge outdoor table for her future, assuming that she would have grandkids clustered around it one day. It hadn\u2019t been used in years.</p><p>She walked purposefully outside and pulled the plastic covering off the table, exposing it to the sunlight again.</p><p>Then the garden caught her eye.</p><p>In bare feet, she walked across the dewy grass and stared down at her runaway garden. Everything was a mess; the rows she\u2019d once clipped so carefully were impossible to distinguish in the riot of color. There were flowers everywhere\u2014blooming in spite of her absence, their colorful blossoms tangling up with one another.</p><p>Before, she would have seen disorder here, plants that grew where they weren\u2019t supposed to and bloomed with abandon. She would have gone in search of her tools\u2014clippers and trowels and stakes\u2014and set about the task of re-creation.</p><p>Now, though, on this bright morning, she saw what she hadn\u2019t seen before. There was a beauty in chaos, a wildness that hinted at things gone wrong and mistakes overcome. She stood there a long time, looking down at her ruined and yet still beautiful garden. Finally, she knelt in the grass and began pulling up weeds. When she\u2019d cleared a space, she got shakily to her feet. It was a start.</p><p>She went to her glass-sided greenhouse, where once she\u2019d poured her heart and soul into trays filled with black soil. Things were forgotten in here now, draped in cobwebs. A watering system had kept everything alive; plants, like people, learned to grow in rocky terrain. Up on a high shelf in the back, she found what she was looking for: a small white packet of wildflower seeds. She\u2019d bought them years ago, from a friend of Mia and Zach\u2019s who\u2019d been selling them outside of Safeway. For a trip somewhere, she thought. She\u2019d never intended to plant them, not wildflowers that could sprout anywhere.</p><p>Taking the packet of seeds from the shelf, she walked out and stood in the center of her overgrown garden.</p><p>She poured the mismatched seeds into her palm and stared down at them, reminded of how small things were in the beginning. With a smile, she threw the seeds across the garden. Someday, she would be surprised by what would grow from these seeds. And soon, maybe tomorrow, she would plant a white rose right there, where Mia had lost her first tooth ...</p><p>Returning to the house, she made a pot of coffee. The smoky, roasted scent of it filled the house, drew Miles stumbling into the kitchen with his hand outstretched, mumbling, \u201cCoffee.\u201d</p><p>She handed him a cup, black. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels.\u201d</p><p>Miles frowned. \u201cYou know I have trouble before coffee, but were we talking about angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the cemetery today,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI decided yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>She loved him for asking. \u201cThis is something I need to do by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me when you get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid I\u2019ll throw myself in some open hole?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her and drew back. \u201cBeen there, done that. Not worried anymore. You\u2019ve come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Frodo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Frodo. Sam. Sam came home and got married and had a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m Sam.\u201d</p><p>She stood by him in the kitchen for the next half hour, sipping coffee and talking. When he left her and headed for the shower, she was struck by the extraordinariness of it all: that they could stand around and talk about little things again. A potential dinner party. The newest coffee maker. A movie that was getting good reviews.</p><p>She had gone a whole hour without thinking about her heartache. That might not sound like much to some people, but to her it was monumental, like swimming the English Channel. It offered her a glimpse of something she\u2019d given up on: the possibility of being herself again, of even someday being happy with her life. She knew she could never let go of her sadness, but maybe Harriet was right: maybe she could go on. Maybe time didn\u2019t heal wounds exactly, but it gave you a kind of armor, or a new perspective. A way to remember with a smile instead of a sob. Maybe someday when a stranger asked how many children she had, she could simply say one and talk about Zach.</p><p>God, she hoped so.</p><p>She met Miles in the bathroom and went into the shower as he was coming out. He patted her bare butt, and she smiled and scooted out of his reach and ducked into the hot water. She was rinsing the conditioner out of her hair when the glass door opened.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d Miles said again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Call Zach and remind them that we\u2019re going to the aquarium tomorrow. Mom is meeting us there.\u201d</p><p>Miles paused, and she knew him well enough to recognize that he was thinking about something.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, stepping out of the shower, wrapping a towel around her body.</p><p>\u201cWe had a pretty big anniversary a few years ago. We didn\u2019t celebrate it. We didn\u2019t celebrate any of them ... after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do better this year. Dinner at Canlis.\u201d</p><p>He held out a familiar blue velvet box.</p><p>She was shaking as she reached out for the small, soft box. The velvet was worn on top; that was how often she\u2019d held it, but she hadn\u2019t touched it in years. Releasing a deep breath, she flipped open the lid. One a bed of stark white, Mia\u2019s graduation ring stood up proudly, the gold glinting in the light. The once-empty prongs had been filled with a sparkling pink diamond.</p><p>Jude looked up at this man she loved, and the full power of that emotion, of their commitment, surged through her like a tide carrying her home. He knew her better than she knew herself; he knew that she needed this reminder of their daughter, something Jude could wear, see every day.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Miles Farraday.\u201d</p><p>He touched her face, smiling. \u201cYou\u2019re a warrior. You know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, whispered, \u201cTell her hi for me,\u201d and then went back into the bedroom.</p><p>After he left the house, she dried her hair and dressed in a pair of old, comfortable jeans and a white hoodie. Ordinarily, she\u2019d take the time to put on makeup, but today she didn\u2019t feel the need to hide anything. She was who she was: a woman who\u2019d survived a war of the heart and had the wrinkles to prove it.</p><p>She meant to leave right away, but somehow she couldn\u2019t do it. She spent the next few hours doing chores, picking things up around the house, doing laundry, making a casserole for dinner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stalling. Finally, at just after one o\u2019clock, she drew in a deep breath and stopped moving. It\u2019s time, Jude. Now.</p><p>Slinging a purse over her shoulder, she went to her car and drove away. As she came to the corner, sunlight skittered along the blue water below and winked from windows along either shore. Such a beautiful, beautiful day.</p><p>At Night Road, she slowed down. It had been years since she\u2019d dared to turn onto this stretch of asphalt where her life had changed. It was time to face it at last.</p><p>She turned and kept driving. Then, after about a half a mile or so, she pulled off to the side of the road and parked. Slowly, she got out of the car and crossed the street.</p> <p>The remnants of the memorial were barely visible.</p><p>She stood at the hairpin turn.</p><p>The forest was dark here, even in midday. Ancient, towering evergreens grew in dense thickets on either side, their mossy, spearlike trunks rising high enough into the summer sky to block out the sun. Shadows were knee-deep along this worn ribbon of asphalt; the air was still and quiet, like an indrawn breath. Expectant.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t stay here long. If someone saw her on this lonely roadside, the talk would start up, people would worry about her. Still, she closed her eyes for just a moment, remembering that night, so long ago, when the rain had turned to ash ...</p><p>Letting it go.</p> <p>At last, she returned to her car and drove off the island.</p><p>It took her less than thirty minutes to reach her destination. That surprised her. Somehow, she thought it should have been farther away. It had taken her years to get here, after all.</p><p>The cemetery was a rolling landscape of manicured lawn studded with the decorations of death: headstones, monuments, stone benches.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cCome on, Judith. You can do this.\u201d She reached into the backseat for the three pink balloons she\u2019d bought at the florist\u2019s shop yesterday. Clutching the strings, she herded them up and left her car. In her mind, she clicked through the directions she\u2019d gotten yesterday, but it didn\u2019t really matter. She could have found her child blindfolded ...</p><p>And there was the marker. A smooth granite headstone with an etching of Mia\u2019s face in its center.</p><p>MIA EILEEN FARRADAY.</p> <p>1986\u20142004</p><p>LOVING DAUGHTER AND SISTER.</p><p>NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN.</p><p>There was a small gift-of-life symbol there, too, memorializing the lives she\u2019d saved.</p><p>Jude held her ridiculous balloons, staring at the image of her daughter\u2019s face. Even in granite, Mia\u2019s smile shone brightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get here. I got ... lost,\u201d she finally said, and once she started talking, she couldn\u2019t stop. She sat down on a granite bench and told Mia everything.</p><p>For years, Jude had worried that she would forget her daughter, that time would somehow sand away her memories until nothing solid was left, but now, sitting here in the sunshine, holding her balloons, she remembered everything\u2014how Mia used to suck her thumb and stroke her stuffed puppy\u2019s satin paws, how she used to break into a run just before she saw Jude in the carpool lane, how she ate her oranges in sections, tearing away every tiny speck of white, how in a hurry she was to grow up.</p><p>\u201cI bought you this ring ... a long time ago,\u201d Jude said, feeling the tug of both sadness and joy. It was strange how those emotions could coexist at a moment like this. \u201cI bought it for an eighteen-year-old girl who I thought was my future.\u201d She stared down at the pink diamond. It sparkled in the sunlight, danced.</p> <p>Every time she looked at this ring, she would remember something about her daughter. Sometimes she would cry, but that was okay, because someday, maybe she would smile. Or even laugh.</p><p>That was something she had learned the past few weeks. In the sea of grief, there were islands of grace, moments in time when one could remember what was left rather than all that had been lost.</p><p>She stood and released the balloons into the sky. The pink dots swirled and bounced on an invisible current of air, as if an impatient girl had grabbed at them and missed. A sound like laughter came through the trees, and Jude experienced a profound sense of peace. She\u2019d been wrong before; her daughter was here, with her, inside of her. She\u2019d always been here, even when Jude was too broken to look for her. But it was time now to say, \u201cGood-bye, baby ... I love you.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in years, she believed that her daughter could hear her. </p> </body></html>"]
