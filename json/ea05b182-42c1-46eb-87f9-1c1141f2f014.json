And he\u2019d seen a lot of horrific things over the years. He\u2019d served several rotations in Iraq and witnessed the aftermath of suicide bombers. He\u2019d seen animals used as vessels to hold bombs. He\u2019d been in a caravan that\u2019d hit a string of IEDs, resulting in death and dismemberment of his fellow soldiers. He hadn\u2019t come away from war unscathed\u2014he\u2019d lost most of his left leg, part of his hand, and bore scars, both visible and invisible.</p><p>During his time as deputy in Crook County, he\u2019d dealt with deadly car accidents, including a fatality involving his cousin, Luke McKay. He\u2019d broken up domestic disputes where one or both of the parties were drunk, armed, angry, and bleeding. He\u2019d stumbled across a wild horse slaughter.</p> <p>But this? It was beyond sickening.</p><p>The hysterical 911 call from the neighbor who\u2019d discovered the bodies hadn\u2019t prepared him at all for what he\u2019d found at the crime scene.</p><p>His stomach roiled as his brain flashed back to the carnage and he fought the urge to throw up.</p><p>Again.</p><p>But Cam hadn\u2019t been alone in his reaction. Sheriff Shortbull had stumbled outside and heaved over the juniper hedge after his glimpse at the dead couple.</p> <p>A murder/suicide.</p><p>In Sundance, Wyoming.</p><p>Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.</p><p>Maybe it seemed worse because Cam knew the couple. He\u2019d graduated from high school with Jeff Wingate. Cam couldn\u2019t fathom how the mild-mannered insurance salesman could carry out such brutality, especially to his wife. And Angela hadn\u2019t fought back. She\u2019d literally lay down and died.</p><p>What a fucking waste.</p><p>What a fucking mess.</p> <p>There\u2019d been no indication of domestic issues. No 911 phone calls in the last year. No history of violence. He\u2019d seen them eating in Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish two weeks ago. They\u2019d acted... happy.</p><p>Because the crime scene was beyond their small county\u2019s investigative expertise, they\u2019d had to call in the DCI from Cheyenne. Which meant waiting for the crew to arrive. But neither Cam nor Sheriff Shortbull could stomach waiting inside the house where the bloodbath had occurred.</p><p>So they stood outside in the frigid February weather, taking turns warming up in their patrol cars. He and the sheriff were too disturbed to slide into their usual defense mechanism, cracking jokes\u2014which was how most law enforcement officers handled unpleasant aspects of the job\u2014trying to find any bit of humor to escape the horror of the gruesome scene.</p><p>About two hours into the wait for the experts to arrive, a Ford Explorer inched up the driveway and parked.</p><p>Cam intercepted Angela\u2019s parents, Jim and Teresa Swensen, after they\u2019d exited their car; the sheriff blocked access to the house.</p><p>Jim tried to sidestep Cam, while Angela\u2019s mother cowered behind her husband like a broken shadow. Cam braced himself, trying to imagine how he\u2019d feel if it were one of his kids behind that door. But he couldn\u2019t fathom that level of grief. Couldn\u2019t imagine facing that horror.</p><p>Jim asked, \u201cIs it true? What Becca saw inside the house?\u201d</p><p>Damn gossipmonger. \u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d Cam asked evenly.</p> <p>\u201cBecca said she saw them both. Dead.\u201d His wild eyes turned accusatory. \u201cDid the sheriff\u2019s office intend to notify us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we\u2019d dealt with some of the preliminary issues.\u201d</p><p>Cam hadn\u2019t expected this grisly situation would be kept under wraps for long, not in a town this size, especially since both Angela and Jeff and their families were well liked within the community.</p><p>\u201cOur Angela. She\u2019s really in there,\u201d Jim half-whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s... dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, she is. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to see her.\u201d</p><p>The image of her bullet-riddled body jumped into Cam\u2019s head, unbidden. \u201cYou can\u2019t. It\u2019s a crime scene.\u201d And no parent should ever witness such an atrocity done to their child.</p><p>\u201cJeff killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears so.\u201d</p><p>Jim\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cDid he attack her? Did she fight back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the DCI folks to arrive and help us sort out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before they get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. It\u2019s why we didn\u2019t contact anyone. So why don\u2019t you and Teresa head home and we\u2019ll be in touch as soon as we know anything,\u201d Cam said gently. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do here.\u201d</p><p>Jim shook his head and made a break for it.</p><p>Cam swore and started to give chase, but Teresa grabbed the back of his coat, holding him in place. Cam\u2019s prosthesis was dicey on an uneven crust of snow\u2014one icy misstep and it could pop off completely. And at six foot five, he could do some damage to tiny Teresa if he tried to knock her down.</p><p>Sheriff Shortbull had been watching the events unfold and he\u2019d intercepted Jim before the grief-stricken father ducked around the back of the house.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t kept Jim from seeing the bloody footprints in the snow that led from the back door to the detached garage and then back inside.</p><p>Jim fell to his knees, releasing an agonized wail that ripped Cam\u2019s soul. Teresa immediately let go of Cam. He turned, expecting to see her racing toward her anguished husband, but she was making a beeline for the unmanned front door of her daughter\u2019s house.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Cam snagged her arm, stopping her, and managed to duck when she took a swing at him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go! I have to see her! I have to know that she\u2019s really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me when I tell you that you don\u2019t want to see her like that. Please. Mrs. Swensen. Listen to me. Don\u2019t try to go in there again. It\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>Teresa crumpled to the ground and wept.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do a damn thing but stand beside her and listen while she sobbed inconsolably. Wishing he were anyplace else but here, watching a family\u2019s life forever changed.</p><p>And just when Cam thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, another car barreled up the driveway.</p><p>Both Jim and Teresa turned to look with hope on their faces. Almost as if they expected this death thing had been a horrible mix-up, and Angela would be climbing out of the car.</p><p>Cam squinted. Was that Angela\u2019s sister, Monica?</p><p>Then snow flew as Jim and Teresa raced toward the Lincoln.</p><p>When Sheriff Shortbull yelled, \u201cMcKay. Call for backup. Now!\u201d Cam realized the car contained Jeff\u2019s parents, Bob and Sharon Wingate.</p><p>Jesus. Now they\u2019d have try to preserve the crime scene and prevent four grieving parents from ripping each other apart.</p><p>After Cam called in an immediate request for assistance, he hustled over to help the sheriff, who was dodging blows from Jim Swensen as he tried to stop Jim from attacking Bob Wingate.</p><p>Screaming and obscenities echoed to Cam\u2019s left as Teresa rained down her frustration on Sharon. She punctuated each harsh word with a hard shove, until Sharon lost her footing on the ice and fell on her butt. Then Teresa pounced on her.</p><p>Before Cam could separate the hair-pulling pair, Sharon flipped Teresa on her back and pummeled her in the face, knocking her out cold.</p><p>Heartsick for these families, but forced to do his job, Cam gently pried Sharon away from Teresa. Then he corralled Bob as the sheriff slapped a pair of handcuffs on Jim. Cam had no choice but to handcuff Bob, too.</p><p>No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t tune out the venom Bob spewed at him. At the sheriff. At Jim. When Jim shrieked back, sounding more like a wounded animal than a man, Cam wished he had gags. And earplugs. And a different goddamn job.</p><p>Sheriff Shortbull shoved Jim into the back of his patrol car and Cam put Bob in his car. Then they went to deal with the mothers.</p><p>Teresa had come around. She blinked, as if waking up from a bad dream. When she saw Sharon, Teresa ignored the blood dripping down the front of her coat and charged her.</p><p>Cam and the sheriff ended up cuffing both women and placing them in the cars with their respective husbands.</p><p>Before Cam closed the door, Bob\u2019s accusation rang out loud and clear. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you help him?\u201d</p><p>Cam froze. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boy. Jeff. He came back from war... broken. Not on the outside like you.\u201d Bob\u2019s pain-filled eyes dropped to Cam\u2019s left leg. \u201cBut on the inside. That\u2019s worse. You knew him. You should\u2019ve tried... You should\u2019ve reached out to him.\u201d</p><p>Cam had no response for that. He just quietly shut the door.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Angela\u2019s sister showed up and whisked her parents away, promising to keep them under lock and key. Immediately following their departure, Jeff\u2019s brother, Cliff, appeared to take custody of Bob and Sharon.</p><p>Deputy Rick parked at the end of the road, keeping other curious onlookers at bay. Finally, at two o\u2019clock, the DCI vans arrived.</p><p>The sheriff walked the techs through the scene and left the house as quickly as possible.</p><p>Neither he nor Cam said anything in the four hours the DCI took to catalogue the scene, bag the victims and tag the evidence.</p><p>As near as the DCI experts could figure, the bodies had expired within an hour of each other. No sign that anyone else had been in the house with them. It looked as if Jeff Wingate had pulled out his .22 and emptied all fifteen clips into Angela, right in their bedroom.</p><p>Then Jeff had walked through her blood, leaving bloody footprints from the bedroom to the garage, and picked up the\u2014</p><p>\u201cSheriff? Deputy? We\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Cam and Sheriff Shortbull faced the crime scene tech, a petite blonde, early twenties, with a waxy complexion and haunted eyes. She reminded Cam of his daughter Liesl. He couldn\u2019t imagine his sweet daughter seeing something this horrific. Would the young lady speak to her parents about the atrocities she saw in her job?</p><p>Who do you speak to about the atrocities you\u2019ve seen?</p><p>No one.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything else from us?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. My boss will be out to wrap up. I just...\u201d She glanced back at the house and shivered. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlad to know we\u2019re not the only ones,\u201d the sheriff said.</p><p>Cam wasn\u2019t surprised the sheriff tried to put the young woman at ease, but the normally congenial man couldn\u2019t even muster a smile.</p><p>After another brief conversation, the vans pulled away. No sirens. No flashing lights. No hurry.</p> <p>Darkness had fallen. Cam wasn\u2019t a believer in ghosts. But if any apparitions or memory echoes were to appear, it\u2019d be on a night like this. Pitch black. No moon. Wisps of snow clouds scuttled across the dark sky with wraithlike fingers.</p><p>They\u2019d opted not to drape the house\u2014or the access to it\u2014in crime scene tape. Locals knew where Jeff and Angela lived. They\u2019d drive by out of morbid curiosity and disbelief.</p><p>News crews from Cheyenne, Casper and Denver would figure out the location\u2014no need to make it easy on them. Guaranteed this case would become newsworthy. Local couple found in a murder/suicide on Valentine\u2019s Day. He just hoped some of the details would be kept private.</p><p>Details like Jeff\u2019s military service? Which you hadn\u2019t known about?</p><p>He tuned out Bob Wingate\u2019s accusation and checked his phone. Six messages from Domini. His wife\u2019s escalating concern drove home the point that he couldn\u2019t face his family in his present dark mood.</p> <p>Their brood\u2014six kids adopted over the course of the last three years, ranging in age from two to nine\u2014was loud, messy, fierce, loving, joyful and determined. Going home to the family chaos that defined his life was his favorite part of the day. He knew the scene that would greet him. His youngest son, Markus, would be in meltdown mode before supper. His youngest daughter, Sasha, would be watching Dora the Explorer for the umpteenth time. The twins, Dimitri and Oxsana would be fighting over the dog. Anton and Liesl would be talking about their classrooms\u2019 Valentine\u2019s Day parties after finishing chores.</p><p>Cam closed his eyes. Had it only been last night he\u2019d sat at the kitchen table with his oldest son and daughter supervising Valentine preparations? Anton finished his Transformers cards in less than twenty minutes, while Liesl had painstakingly written out every classmate\u2019s name in red marker. And she\u2019d added a pink squiggle of glitter glue to each paper heart she\u2019d created. By the time Liesl had finished her valentines, she\u2019d been covered in red marker, glue and glitter. She claimed her tongue hurt from licking envelopes, and he\u2019d slipped her an ice cream bar to soothe the sting.</p><p>His wife had smiled at them indulgently as she\u2019d directed the twins\u2019 placement of candy hearts atop the pink and white frosted cupcakes.</p><p>Such innocence didn\u2019t need to be tainted by the black cloud surrounding him. Cam texted Domini not to wait up.</p><p>Back in Sundance, he parked his patrol car behind the sheriff\u2019s office. Both he and the sheriff wrote their reports while the horror was still fresh in their minds. Then they headed to the Golden Boot bar and attempted to dull those too-sharp edges of shock.</p><p>Before they\u2019d finished the first beer, people wanted to know what\u2019d really happened with the Wingates. Some even offered hypothetical motives. As an elected official, the sheriff couldn\u2019t be rude. He answered questions with grace and ease that looked completely effortless, but Cam could see it was taking a toll on the man.</p> <p>Finally, Lettie, the bar owner, spirited them to the back, away from continual interruptions. She dropped off a round and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is useful information, but Jeff and Angela were in here three days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did they seem?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>\u201cJeff looked a little rough around the edges. Angela kept fussing at him. Urging him to eat. Touching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that irritate him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. It appeared to soothe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they weren\u2019t fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They even danced once before they left. It was sweet. They only ever had eyes for each other as teenagers.\u201d She looked at Cam with sad eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember they were crowned king and queen of the winter formal in their junior year? We were all so happy they reconnected after Jeff moved back home a few years ago.\u201d She clucked her tongue. \u201cThose poor families. Left to wonder why. I don\u2019t envy you guys your jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Cam mumbled into his beer.</p> <p>The sheriff sighed. \u201cThere goes the jealous rage theory.\u201d</p><p>They drank in silence until a shadow fell across the table. Cam looked up as Doctor Joely Monroe, a feisty redhead with gamine features and a brusque manner, scooted next to the sheriff in the booth.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc,\u201d Cam said. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s not a coincidence that you\u2019re here?\u201d As the only physician in the area, chances were good she\u2019d treated the victims at some point in the last few years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting some folks later, but I figured I\u2019d find you guys drinking after the day you\u2019ve had.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cSo it\u2019s true? About Jeff and Angela?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She sighed and shoved her hand through her hair, making the short red tresses stick straight up. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it matters, but Angela was my patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Jeff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Doctor Monroe motioned Lettie over to the table. \u201cTwo lemon drop martinis, each with a lemon vodka chaser.\u201d She gestured to them. \u201cYou guys want anything?\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Shortbull shook his head.</p><p>Cam said, \u201cAh, no. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>They waited in silence until Lettie returned with the drinks. After the doc upended her first martini, she asked, \u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamndest thing. We\u2019re not exactly sure,\u201d Sheriff Shortbull said and relayed the events. \u201cDo you know anything that could shed light on this case?\u201d</p><p>Her shrewd gaze winged to his. \u201cWho will hear this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to assure you that it\u2019ll stay between us, but these things have a way of getting out. You know that. Especially in this case, because everyone is trying to make sense of... something in this fucked-up situation.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Fiddled with the stem of her martini glass. \u201cI can tell you that I recently found out Jeff suffered from PTSD.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s gut clenched for the second time at the reminder he\u2019d had no idea Jeff had served in the military, let alone in a combat unit. As Cam tried to think back to the past few years and whether he\u2019d simply forgotten that piece of information, Bob Wingate\u2019s accusations pushed front and center. You should have reached out to him.</p><p>\u201cAngela came into the office last week for her annual checkup. She had bruises on her arms and legs. When I asked why, she said Jeff had been suffering from more combat nightmares than usual. He thrashed around a lot at night and she bore the brunt of it.\u201d</p><p>Cam felt himself nodding. Those types of flashbacks were so real he woke covered in sweat, his throat raw from heat and sand, feeling like he\u2019d been in the desert fighting for his life.</p><p>\u201cWas Angela concerned for her safety?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>Doc Monroe shook her head. \u201cShe swore she knew how to handle it. Handle him. I had no reason not to believe her or I would\u2019ve suggested she stay someplace safer.\u201d She drained the vodka shot. \u201cI see abused women in my practice far too often. I never would\u2019ve put Angela in that category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you back up?\u201d Cam said. \u201cBob Wingate said something to me earlier, and you just confirmed it, but I had no idea Jeff was a combat vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Sheriff Shortbull added. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve bowled with Jeff the last few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy understanding is he was a supply clerk in the National Guard. His unit, based out of Laramie, where he joined during college, got called for Operation Iraqi Freedom. They saw the worst of the initial resistance. Jeff was stationed over there about... a year, I guess.\u201d Doc Monroe looked at Cam. \u201cYou weren\u2019t around then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was also in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela said he wouldn\u2019t speak of that time. Like it\u2019d never happened. As soon as he\u2019d fulfilled his enlistment requirements, he moved back to Sundance from Laramie. She knew he\u2019d been diagnosed with PTSD, but his family had no idea. He refused counseling or medication. And ninety-nine percent of the time he was fine.\u201d</p><p>But that unstable one percent was the unknown\u2014and in this case, a real killer.</p><p>Cam ordered another round for himself. Much like Jeff, he didn\u2019t talk to his family about being a combat survivor. If he hadn\u2019t needed his prosthesis checked twice a year, he\u2019d probably never step foot in the VA. After he\u2019d lost his leg, part of his hand, and received an honorable medical discharge, he\u2019d cut himself off from everyone in his former military life except for a couple guys from his unit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be gross, but Jeff really... offed himself with a chainsaw?\u201d Doc Monroe asked.</p><p>The sheriff nodded. \u201cThe modern day method of falling on his sword. Except he turned it on and...\u201d He drained his beer. \u201cEvidently, it was an older model with no safeguards. It stayed on and kept cutting through everything in its path until it ran out of gas.\u201d</p><p>Both the sheriff and Cam shuddered at the gruesome mental image of the carnage left in the wake of a runaway chainsaw.</p><p>Doc Monroe polished off her second martini. \u201cI\u2019m not a detective, but do any of the pieces fit together yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore now than they did before you joined us. So thanks, Doc. I\u2019ll have to add the supposition to my report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe supposition being...\u201d She paused and then said, \u201cThat Angela must\u2019ve startled Jeff during one of his combat nightmares and he emptied his handgun into her. When he realized what he\u2019d done, he killed himself in a manner which he knew he wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably as close to the truth as we\u2019ll ever get,\u201d Cam said. \u201cNo one will ever really know what went on.\u201d</p><p>She looked at them, her brow furrowed, and Cam knew she\u2019d gone back into doctor mode. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like either of you can easily forget it. Since you have access to a top-notch counselor through the sheriff\u2019s office, I recommend you both take advantage of it. This has the potential to haunt you and affect your job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks for that cheery reminder,\u201d the sheriff said dryly. He grabbed his hat off a peg on the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll get someone to drive me home.\u201d Once he stood by the end of the booth, he told Cam, \u201cTake tomorrow off. But let me know how you\u2019re doin\u2019, okay?\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded. His cell phone buzzed with a text message, which he ignored.</p><p>Doc Monroe signaled someone behind him and finished her last shot. \u201cWill you be all right if I take off too?\u201d</p> <p>No. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The pushy doc angled across the table, forcing his attention. \u201cI know you, Deputy Cameron McKay. Don\u2019t do this to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what? Wonder why I had no freakin\u2019 clue about Jeff\u2019s military service? Maybe I could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have done anything. He would\u2019ve turned away your help if you\u2019d offered.\u201d</p><p>Probably true. But it didn\u2019t diminish his feelings of guilt.</p> <p>\u201cI can also see you\u2019re worried part of you is like Jeff, because you also suffer from PTSD. That one night you\u2019ll wake up disoriented and you\u2019ll open fire on your family. Cam, that won\u2019t ever happen. Not with you.\u201d</p><p>Pissed him off that she\u2019d picked up on that. \u201cHow can you be so sure? No one would\u2019ve predicted a fucking insurance salesman would fill his wife\u2019s body with bullets.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an intense look. \u201cWhat do you do with your gun when you\u2019re done with your shift?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cEither leave it locked up at work or lock it in the gun safe at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any unattended firearms anywhere in your house right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre any of the firearms in your house loaded? Even the ones locked in the gun safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your gun safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you happened to wake up disoriented from a combat nightmare, you couldn\u2019t just reach for your gun beneath your pillow or pull it from the nightstand drawer. You\u2019d have to grab your crutches, hobble from your bedroom to the garage, use the keys to open the gun safe, pick a firearm, and load the right clip into the gun itself. Now you\u2019re ready to aim and fire, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019d still be asleep after all that? Think you wouldn\u2019t have a conscious thought about what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have woken up with my goddamn hands wrapped around Domini\u2019s neck,\u201d he snapped. \u201cDo you have any idea how much that eats at me?\u201d He held out his shaking hands. \u201cLook at these paws. One swipe, one unconscious twist, and I could hurt her. I could even kill her. Just like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. No. No. No. No.\u201d She punctuated every no with a loud smack on the table. \u201cYou aren\u2019t like Jeff Wingate. Not at all. Not even fucking close, Cam. He never faced his demons. You are fully aware of yours. That at least gives you a fighting chance at knowing how to chase them away.\u201d</p><p>Cam almost said something flip about facing his six demon kids everyday, but he held back.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a million McKay family members, but somehow I don\u2019t think you let them see this conflicted side. Except for maybe... Keely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to. But...\u201d It felt like he was betraying Domini even talking to his sister about such intensely emotional baggage. Yet, he didn\u2019t want to talk to his wife about it, either.</p><p>Maybe if you don\u2019t talk to someone about this shit you will end up just like Jeff Wingate.</p><p>\u201cIf you want a fresh pair of ears, Cam, I\u2019m around. Completely confidential. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, Doc. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She patted his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now I have to scoot and meet my Valentine\u2019s Day dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDates? As in more than one?\u201d Cam asked to her retreating back. He poked his head around the edge of the booth and watched his cousins, Chet and Remy West, escorting the lovely and lively doc from the bar.</p><p>Huh. Maybe he was drunker than he thought.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t keep Cam from drinking steadily over the next couple hours. Everyone left him alone, left him mired in thoughts ranging from morose to manic to plain moronic.</p><p>So he was shocked when his brother Colt slid into the booth opposite him. \u201cAm I hallucinating? My recovering alcoholic big bro is in... a bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I am here to haul your drunken ass home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho called you?\u201d That\u2019d come out belligerent.</p><p>\u201cLettie called Domini. Domini called me. She knows I won\u2019t be tempted to linger in here with you and suck down what\u2019s left of the keg.\u201d Colt squinted at the empty pitcher of beer and then at Cam. \u201cAnd I\u2019m strong enough to carry you into the house if need be. Will I hafta do that, Deputy Bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably if I have any more. But I\u2019ve been done drinking for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Colt motioned and Lettie appeared. \u201cCan we leave out the kitchen door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like old times, huh?\u201d Lettie snickered. \u201cSneakin\u2019 two McKay boys out the back.\u201d</p><p>Cam\u2019s wobbliness had nothing to do with his bum leg and Colt propped him up without Cam having to ask.</p><p>On the ride home, Colt said, \u201cSo from what I\u2019ve heard, a bad day on the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe worst.\u201d He thought back to the night his cousin Luke had died. \u201cOne of the worst, for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDomini\u2019s beside herself with worry. Especially after she found out you were first on the scene this morning. And then she hasn\u2019t heard a word from you except a single text.\u201d</p><p>This day was a clusterfuck from one end to the other. \u201cI just... I didn\u2019t feel like talking about it. I still don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Cam closed his eyes and leaned back into the headrest. After a bit he said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s too late to quit my job as a deputy and start ranching fulltime?\u201d</p><p>Colt snorted. \u201cNo dice. You\u2019d last two days and I\u2019d have to pick up your slack. Besides, you\u2019re a good cop, Cam. You\u2019re doing exactly what you oughta be. Yeah, some days are gonna suck ass. Part of life. Crawling into a bottle ain\u2019t the way to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see bad shit on a daily basis that most people don\u2019t ever see. Do you have a way to cope with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike blathering on to a shrink or something? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deal with it all yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Of course that wasn\u2019t the end of the discussion. Colt kept pushing. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna bring the bad stuff from your job home sometimes. Don\u2019t try and hide it. Let your kids and your wife see that your working life ain\u2019t all roses and bein\u2019 treated like a hero. Let them be the light to ward off the darkness that comes with your job.\u201d</p><p>Few people gave Colt credit for being insightful, but Colt had been through some bad things in his life and his advice was solid. Cam whistled. \u201cWhoa, bro. That\u2019s almost poetic.\u201d</p><p>Colt laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re drunker than I thought if you\u2019re callin\u2019 me a poet. Come on. I\u2019ll help you inside.\u201d</p><p>Cam lowered himself to the ground and accepted Colt\u2019s help getting up the steps.</p><p>Domini met them on the porch. The kids were still up and she shooed Liesl, Anton, Dimitri, Oxsana and their dog, Gracie, back inside. She slipped her arm inside Cam\u2019s coat and he welcomed her warmth. Her support. The unconditional love that reminded him he was the luckiest man alive to get to come home to her every night.</p><p>She said, \u201cThank you, Colt, for bringing him home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Cam pressed his lips on the top of Domini\u2019s head. Inhaling her familiar scent. But she didn\u2019t let the affectionate gesture linger. She pulled him into the house. Into the chaos that he normally reveled in.</p><p>But the lights were too bright. The TV too loud. Gracie barked and whined when Anton scolded her. Liesl chattered like a magpie, purposely talking over the twins.</p><p>Colt clapped him on the back. \u201cWhenever I think my house is a zoo with two kids, it\u2019s good to come to your place. Makes our house look like a freakin\u2019 monastery. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Cam nodded and the door slammed behind his brother.</p><p>Domini unbuttoned his coat and removed it. She slid her hands up his chest and wreathed her arms around his neck, pressing her lithe body against his. \u201cI was worried about you. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>No. I\u2019m not even fucking close to all right.</p><p>She eased back and peered into his face. \u201cI can see you\u2019re not.\u201d She rose to her toes, kissed his mouth and whispered, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me crawl into bed and put this day behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam, it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day. The kids planned a special surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I can\u2019t... be around them. I c-can\u2019t let them see me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a little while? They\u2019ve been waiting.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and closed his eyes, not able to bear their disappointed faces. \u201cI can\u2019t. Not tonight. I need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, wait until you see what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiesl. Honey, remember what we talked about?\u201d Domini said.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was a dumb idea,\u201d Anton taunted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dumb idea,\u201d Liesl retorted.</p><p>Anton and Liesl argued.</p><p>Then Oxsana and Dimitri argued.</p><p>Markus beat on a xylophone and Sasha yelled at him to stop until he began to cry.</p><p>The phone started to ring.</p><p>The dog yipped.</p><p>Cam walked down the hallway to their bedroom and shut the door.</p><p>Alone in the silence. He could hear himself breathing in the blessed quiet.</p><p>Then gruesome images and coulda-woulda-shoulda regrets pushed this day\u2019s awful events into the flashes of death from his military past, so it was like a horror movie stuck on replay\u2014a speeded-up version of a movie that he couldn\u2019t get to shut off even if he closed his damn eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why had he thought he\u2019d wanted to be alone? His mind wasn\u2019t a quiet void. In fact, it was a damn unpleasant place to be today.</p><p>He stripped and removed his prosthesis. Grabbing his crutches, he headed for the shower. He remained under the steaming spray until his fingers were pruny and he\u2019d run out of tears.</p><p>Five minutes after he crawled between the sheets and lay there in the darkness, staring at the ceiling, he heard Domini enter their bedroom and lock the door. Then her warm, naked body slid next to his. Her cool hands caressed his face.</p><p>He sighed. This woman filled his life with more happiness than he\u2019d ever known. She deserved better than a man who retreated when his dark edges emerged. But better to be a ghost of a man who disappeared rather than a monster of a man who pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger.</p><p>\u201cThe kids are in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t help with them tonight. I know they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. Baby. It\u2019s okay. Tomorrow is a new day.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut against a rush of tears. He turned his head and kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do. I also know you probably don\u2019t want to talk about what happened.\u201d Her fingers ruffled the hair on his chest. \u201cEven though your body is still, I can tell you\u2019re restless.\u201d</p><p>His cock was starting to stir with her every teasing caress over his skin. Definitely not suffering from whiskey dick.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you with that restlessness, Cam.\u201d Her fist closed around his thickening shaft. \u201cJust relax and let me ease you.\u201d</p><p>His whole body seized up. Ease him? Like she was doing him a goddamned favor? He half-snarled, \u201cIs this a pity fuck?\u201d before he could bite it back.</p><p>But his sexy wife emitted a throaty laugh and lightly slapped his dick. \u201cYes, because it\u2019s such a chore to put my hands all over your strong body. It\u2019s pure torture. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever bear it.\u201d She nipped his shoulder with her teeth. \u201cBut somehow, I\u2019ll suffer through and take one for team McKay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled for the first time in what seemed like days. \u201cSuch a noble sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d She angled forward to lick his nipple. Goose flesh rippled down his abdomen. \u201cBesides. It is Valentine\u2019s Day and I\u2019ll get cranky if I don\u2019t get laid.\u201d She pressed kisses from the tip of his chin up his jawline to his ear. \u201cVery, very cranky, since I\u2019m pretty sure you didn\u2019t get me a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDom, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not up for this.\u201d She squeezed his erection. \u201cBecause I\u2019m holding the ultimate lie detector and it\u2019s saying... mount up.\u201d</p><p>Cam groaned and rolled his hips into her stroking hand.</p><p>\u201cYou need a reminder of what\u2019s good and a chance to forget the bad. Since the word ease pushed your buttons, how about this... Sir, will you let me have my wicked way with you?\u201d</p><p>A bold move on Domini\u2019s part, asking for control. Outside the bedroom they were equal partners in all things. But here, in their private space, with the door locked, Domini surrendered her sexual will to him. Completely. Without question.</p><p>\u201cSay the word to me, Cam, so I don\u2019t give you a reason to bend me over your knee and paddle my butt for insubordination.\u201d</p><p>He twisted his fingers around the chain dangling from her neck, a symbol of the bond between them few would understand. She always knew exactly what he needed. He tugged her closer by the chain and murmured, \u201cYes. Make me forget.\u201d</p> <p>Domini kissed him with teasing sweetness that gradually heated into passion. She pinned his arms above his head and used every sexual trick in her repertoire to drive him wild. To blank his mind to everything but his frenzied need for her.</p><p>Then she connected their bodies and began to move on him. Taking her time, so he felt every sensuous glide of her soft skin over the rougher rasp of his. Whispering Ukrainian endearments in his ear. Each slide of their sweat-coated bodies drove them higher until finally they tumbled over the edge into that vortex of pleasure together.</p><p>Although winded\u2014and sated\u2014Cam wasn\u2019t ready to return to reality. Didn\u2019t want ugliness to intrude on the beautiful gift of peace Domini had given him. He wanted to stay in this cocoon for a little while longer. He rolled Domini to her back and whispered, \u201cAgain,\u201d losing himself in her heat and softness and goodness.</p><p>Then he slept in her arms, in a surprisingly dreamless sleep.</p><p>The next morning Domini poked him to get up\u2014way, way too early since he didn\u2019t have to work and the kids were out of school.</p><p>Cam rolled over, pulling the pillow over his head, intending to sleep the day away.</p><p>He should\u2019ve known better than to try and thwart his wife, the woman who regularly got six kids up and ready for the day. She opened their bedroom door and let the dog in. An open door was an open invitation, and soon Markus and Sasha climbed onto the bed, crawling all over him. Offering hugs, kisses and giggles as their wiggly bodies began to bounce on the mattress. Then the twins joined in the fun, laughing hysterically at their live game of Hop on Pop, which happened to be a favorite family book. Then Anton joined the fray. Showing off karate kicks and spins.</p><p>Cam grinned at his exuberant kiddos, having so much fun with the forbidden activity. If he still had both legs he probably would\u2019ve joined them. So he egged them on.</p><p>A gasp. Then, \u201cCameron West McKay! You\u2019re letting them jump on the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d And wasn\u2019t his wife a good little actress? Pretending to be indignant when she\u2019d known that he needed to be surrounded by all their smiling faces first thing this morning.</p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d she said, pointing to each kid in turn.</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, kids. Mommy is right. No more monkeys jumping on the bed.\u201d</p><p>They reluctantly bounced off and raced out of the room, laughing.</p><p>Speaking of laughing... Where was Liesl? She was always in the thick of things. But since she, too, wore a pirate\u2019s leg\u2014the phrase she used to describe her prosthesis\u2014she\u2019d probably seen no point in trying to do a one-legged hop.</p><p>He dressed, using his crutches, not bothered in the least that his stump hung out. It\u2019d taken a while for him to feel comfortable letting his family see that broken part of him.</p><p>He came back from the war... broken... on the inside. Why didn\u2019t you reach out to him?</p><p>Dammit. He was not going there today. He was not Jeff Wingate.</p><p>Cam swung into the kitchen as saw Liesl sitting alone at the breakfast bar. She beamed a sunny smile his way as soon as she saw him. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, punkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Liesl crawled onto his lap immediately after he sat down. She hugged him tightly and sighed heavily. Then her gap-toothed smile faded.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy said you were too tired last night for my Valentine\u2019s Day surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was. Sorry, sweetheart. Sometimes my job makes me tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you sad? \u2019Cause you looked kinda sad last night.\u201d</p><p>Cam tucked a flyaway strand of blond hair behind Liesl\u2019s ear. \u201cYeah, I was sad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He struggled to put it in terms she could understand without putting a rainbows-and-butterflies spin on it. \u201cBecause I saw a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>His normally animated daughter wore a somber look. \u201cI was scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared that someone hurted you and that\u2019s why you were so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Liesl, honey. I\u2019m sorry you were scared. No one hurt me. Doing my job... sometimes I see stuff that hurts me inside.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and her pigtails bounced. \u201cSometimes, when I\u2019m sad, my heart hurts.\u201d Then she bent forward and placed a kiss on his chest. \u201cDid that make it feel better?\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to Cam\u2019s eyes. He pulled his precious girl closer to the heart she owned. \u201cYes, sweetheart, it really did.\u201d</p><p>Liesl squirmed away. \u201cNow can I give you the surprise?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at the rapid reminder of her short attention span. \u201cBy all means. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you gotta wear this.\u201d She grabbed a gold paper crown she\u2019d embellished with pink glitter glue swirls and tiny hearts cut from construction paper. \u201cYou get to be the King of Hearts.\u201d</p><p>Cam froze. That was the title given to the king and queen of the junior winter formal. The title that Jeff Wingate had worn.</p><p>A happy, humming Liesl tugged the crown over his head, repositioning it until it was exactly how she wanted it. Then she noticed his change in posture. \u201cDaddy, what\u2019s wrong? Is the crown too tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on his cheeks and stared into his eyes. \u201cDoes your heart hurt again? \u2018Cause I can give it another kiss. Sometimes, it takes a whole bunch.\u201d</p><p>And sometimes in a single instant, it just took the sweetness of one little girl, the happy screaming laughter of his kids, and the loving indulgence of his wife to set everything in his world right again.</p><p>That\u2019s when he really understood he was nothing like Jeff Wingate. When the darkness encroached, he didn\u2019t hide in it for long. He let his wife and children be the forces of nature that pulled him back into the light where he belonged.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried that Mommy might feel bad because you\u2019re the king? Because every king needs a queen, Daddy, everyone knows that. So Mommy has a crown, too. She\u2019s the Queen of Hearts. I put purple hearts on yours because Mommy said a purple heart is a sign of bravery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat color are the hearts on Mommy\u2019s crown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed. Because red means love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed it does. Mommy is all full of love, isn\u2019t she?\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSo are you. Making us matching crowns is a good surprise, Liesl. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Liesl snorted. \u201cDaddy, that\u2019s not the surprise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?

It\u2019s all set up in my bedroom. Everyone is waiting for me to bring the king so the show can start.\u201d</p><p>His theatrical daughter loved to put on a show. That meant impromptu costumes and props from the barn and cardboard backdrops done in crayon, and live music\u2014usually kazoos, a xylophone, maracas, drums and a harmonica\u2014basically full out chaos, kids fighting and screaming and crying, popcorn on the carpet and spilled juice. A total mess that\u2019d take three days to clean up.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t wait to be a part of it.</p><p>Cam adjusted his crown, smiled at his daughter, and bowed formally, while holding onto his crutches. \u201cWell, then, Princess Liesl, lead the way.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cDaddy, You\u2019re silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your highness to you, young lady. Come on. The King of Hearts can\u2019t keep his subjects waiting, can he?\u201d</p><p>ROUGH ROAD</p> <p>Rough Road: Chapter One</p><p>\u201cMama, what\u2019s a faggot?\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s entire body seized up and she nearly dropped the bowl she was washing. She turned her head and met the startled eyes of her husband Trevor, who was packaging leftovers on the counter beside her. She managed to ask, \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that word?\u201d in a steady voice.</p><p>\u201cAt school. A third-grader said my dads were faggots.\u201d</p><p>She briefly closed her eyes. Living an unconventional lifestyle in a conservative rural area guaranteed this question would come up at some point\u2014but she hadn\u2019t expected it this soon. Their six-year-old son Westin had just started first grade a month ago.</p><p>Chassie rinsed and dried her hands before she turned around. \u201cHow about if we wait to talk about it until Papai is done giving Max his bath? You can stay up a little later tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Westin\u2019s big blue eyes were somber, suspicious of the bribe. But he nodded and returned to his \u201chomework\u201d\u2014an activity book they\u2019d purchased after his disappointment at not having schoolwork every night in first grade.</p><p>Trevor came over and set his hands on her shoulders. He kissed her temple and whispered, \u201cCome on, Chass. Baby, take a deep breath. We\u2019ll get through this. That word doesn\u2019t have the power to destroy what we\u2019ve built unless we let it.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled his jaw. \u201cI know that. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d A little person slammed into the backs of her legs. She glanced down. A naked little person.</p><p>Two-year-old Max grinned at her, his brown eyes triumphant, his dark hair sopping wet.</p><p>Edgard sauntered into the kitchen, a bath towel draped over his forearm. \u201cThat boy is as slippery as an eel.\u201d He wrapped the towel around Max like a straightjacket and hoisted him up amidst Max\u2019s happy shrieks and giggles. \u201cKiss Mama and Daddy goodnight, little streaker. Then if we can wrassle your jammies on fast, we\u2019ll have time for one book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo books!\u201d</p><p>Chassie smooched both of Max\u2019s chubby cheeks and smoothed her hand over his wet hair. \u201c\u2019Night, Max. Love you.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor kissed Max\u2019s forehead. \u201cLove you son, \u2019night.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s gaze winged between Chassie and Trevor. He mouthed, \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fill you in upstairs. I need to check on Sophia anyway,\u201d Trevor said. He looked at Chassie. \u201cI\u2019ll tuck her in if she hasn\u2019t already crashed.\u201d</p><p>Four-year-old Sophia ran at such high speed all day that many nights she conked out while watching TV or playing in her room.</p><p>The guys disappeared upstairs.</p><p>Chassie finished cleaning the kitchen and headed to the basement to throw a load of clothes in the washer. Her mind had locked on Westin\u2019s question. She knew one thing about her thoughtful son\u2014the taunt hadn\u2019t been tossed at him just today. Westin tried to figure things out on his own, so she worried he\u2019d been dealing with defining the nasty word for longer than a day.</p><p>She leaned against the wall, fighting tears, fighting memories of the cruelty directed at her growing up. The jeers\u2014lazy Indian, ugly squaw\u2014still lingered years later. Back then she\u2019d been so shy she hadn\u2019t fought back. Her brother Dag might\u2019ve gone after her tormentors, but he\u2019d been fighting his own demons. No doubt he\u2019d had the word faggot hurled at him.</p><p>What really caused that long ago hurt to deepen was the knowledge that if their father had known Dag\u2019s sexual orientation, he would\u2019ve flung that word at his son without hesitation.</p><p>When Chassie, Edgard and Trevor decided to add kids to their family, they all three worked every day to make sure their children knew they were loved. To make sure their children knew their parents loved each other. And to show them that love is what built and what sustained their lives. Especially when it was love that a lot of people didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Chassie held on to that thought as she scaled the stairs.</p><p>Westin spun around in his chair and looked at her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHow about a cup of hot chocolate while we\u2019re waiting for Daddy and Papai? And I can check over your homework.\u201d</p><p>Trevor found a pajama-clad Sophia asleep, stretched out on the floor, coloring books, crayons and chalk scattered around her. The girl burned with jealousy that Westin went to school all day, so she\u2019d started her own school. Since her little brother, Max, was too young to sit still for longer than three minutes, she\u2019d lined up her dolls and stuffed animals as students. She\u2019d crafted individual desks out of boxes and set up her classroom. Such a creative, whimsical girl.</p><p>Trevor returned the crayons to the box and set her teaching supplies on her desk next to the pink plastic tea set. Then he scooped her into his arms and stepped around the debris strewn across the floor.</p><p>Sophie stirred briefly.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetheart. It\u2019s bedtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Daddy, I\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. Much like her mother, the girl fought sleep, regardless if she was already asleep. \u201cIn you go.\u201d Trevor laid her on the unmade bed. He pulled off her socks and tucked the purple satin covers around her.</p><p>She gave him a sleepy smile and reached her arms up for a hug.</p><p>He closed his eyes and just held on to her, this sweet child who filled all their lives with so much joy. He nestled her head in the pillow and kissed her cheek. \u201cThat one is from Mama.\u201d He kissed her other cheek. \u201cThat one is from Papai.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cAnd that one is from me.\u201d He brushed her long, dark hair over her shoulder. \u201cWant the night light on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Her gaze darted to the floor. \u201cCan you get Mr. Tuttles? He\u2019s scared to sleep on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He still thought it a strange name for her favorite bear, but she\u2019d chosen it out of the blue at age two and it\u2019d stuck. He snagged the panda and tucked it next to her. \u201c\u2019Night, darlin\u2019 girl. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Trevor plugged in the nightlight and left the door open a crack before he headed down the hallway to the master bedroom.</p><p>He removed his long-sleeved shirt and T-shirt, tossing them in the hamper along with his dirty jeans. After washing his face and arms, he slipped on a pair of black sweatpants and a gray tank top. He\u2019d need to channel his frustration after they talked to Westin, because guaranteed he\u2019d wanna punch the shit out of something.</p><p>Faggots. Who taunted a kid\u2014a kind, innocent little boy\u2014with that term?</p><p>You would have.</p><p>Goddamn. Trevor didn\u2019t want to think along those lines, to remember the judgmental asshole he\u2019d been at one time. He\u2019d been raised that way\u2014as had Chassie and Edgard\u2014which was why they were raising their kids differently.</p><p>He perched on the edge of their gigantic custom-made bed, forearms resting on his thighs, his face aimed at the carpet. Westin and Sophia were aware their family was different from the norm. But due to divorces and remarriages, didn\u2019t most kids these days deal with multiple parents? How was it anyone\u2019s business how they lived in their own home? Or how they loved each other? He\u2019d bet the ranch very few traditional family units were as attuned to each other as theirs. They had to work harder at communication because of having a third partner. And he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way\u2014regardless of the societal repercussions.</p><p>Footsteps fell across the carpet. A pause. \u201cDid you mean to leave the light on in Sophia\u2019s room?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Guess my mind was elsewhere.\u201d Trevor glanced up. \u201cWas she still awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She just yanked the covers over her head. I shut the light off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. And Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut. He didn\u2019t last through one book, let alone two.\u201d Edgard gave Trevor a once-over. \u201cWe working out tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to hit the heavy bag after...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what?\u201d</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cTrev, what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>So Trevor told him.</p><p>Edgard didn\u2019t say anything. Then he crouched in front of Trevor to get his attention. \u201cThat\u2019s not all of what\u2019s bugging you.\u201d</p><p>The man knew him so well. Trevor reached out and ran the back of his knuckles along Edgard\u2019s jaw. He hadn\u2019t shaved for a day and Trevor had the sudden need to feel beard burn on the inside of his thighs. On his chest. Scraping on his cheeks and neck as he kissed Edgard senseless.</p><p>\u201cDangerous to keep lookin\u2019 at me like that, meu amor. Burning me alive with those fiery eyes of yours won\u2019t make me forget the issue at hand, as much as I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Trevor dropped his hand. \u201cI fuckin\u2019 hate that I used to be that type of kid Westin is dealin\u2019 with. Anything I didn\u2019t understand, I belittled. I laughed when I made kids cry. Laughed. Jesus. How many people I bullied growing up would say I\u2019m getting what I deserve? Seeing my son cry.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cI\u2019m to the point I can handle what anyone calls us. But it breaks my damn heart that Westin is hearing that shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey. You\u2019re not the same man you were. Thank God for that.\u201d Edgard stood and held his hand out to Trevor. \u201cWorrying about karma coming back to bite you in the ass won\u2019t help us now.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he was upright, Trevor tugged Edgard against his body and buried his face in Edgard\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m grateful every damn day that we have this life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. We knew goin\u2019 into it, it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome days I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve all been together eight years. And other days, I feel like my life started when I met Chassie and you came back.\u201d Trevor lifted his head. \u201cDo you think we oughta cancel\u2014\u201d</p><p>Edgard covered his mouth with a brief kiss. \u201cNo. The three of us need the time together. Chassie will be relieved that we\u2019d planned to keep Westin out of school tomorrow anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re all set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. \u201cChass is really gonna be surprised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was surprised. It was a sweet, romantic thing to plan, Trev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? You and Chassie bring out the best in me.\u201d Trevor kissed him, more than a soft peck but less than the tongue tangling soul kiss he preferred. \u201cLet\u2019s go talk to our son.\u201d</p><p>Edgard kept his hands on Trevor\u2019s shoulders as they returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Chassie sat at the head of the table with Westin on her lap. He poked the marshmallows in his cup of hot chocolate.</p><p>They each took a seat beside Chassie.</p><p>\u201cSo I checked Westin\u2019s workbook and he got one hundred percent.\u201d She brushed his blond hair from his forehead. \u201cOur smart boy also translated five words into Portuguese.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d in Portuguese, which brought Westin\u2019s quick smile. Chassie and Trevor were learning the language, just not as fast as the kids.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Papai oughta get me\u2019n Mama a Portuguese workbook, so we don\u2019t fall behind you and your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d help you with it, Daddy. You too, Mama,\u201d Westin added.</p><p>\u201cI know you would, son. You\u2019re a helpful, thoughtful boy.\u201d</p><p>Everyone fell quiet.</p><p>\u201cSo someone said something to you at school today?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>Westin looked up. His gaze winged between Trevor and Edgard. \u201cHe said you were faggots.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s stomach churned. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t know what that word means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh-uh. But he said it like it was a bad word. Is it?\u201d</p><p>That was truly the vilest F word\u2014in Edgard\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an ugly word that people who don\u2019t understand love say to hurt someone\u2019s feelings, and make them feel bad about who they love,\u201d Trevor said softly.</p><p>Edgard covered Trevor\u2019s restless hand with his and threaded their fingers together.</p><p>Chassie kissed the top of Westin\u2019s head. \u201cSee how Daddy and Papai are holding hands? They love each other. Some people think that\u2019s wrong. That two men shouldn\u2019t love each other like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe honestly don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Trevor and Edgard reached for Chassie\u2019s hands at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAnd some people don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that your Daddy and I love each other, and we both love your mama, and she loves us both back,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>Westin silently poked his marshmallows again, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Edgard had no idea if any of this was making sense to him. Westin had three loving parents. He was used to seeing Papai kissing Mama and Daddy. It was normal for Westin and his siblings to witness the love and affection that all three of his parents had for each other. In what universe was that wrong?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kinda quiet. Do you have any questions?\u201d</p><p>Westin shook his head. His blond hair fell across his forehead and Chassie lovingly smoothed it back.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Trevor prompted.</p><p>Those blue eyes were enormous when he asked, \u201cHe said I\u2019m probably a faggot too. Am I?\u201d</p><p>Chassie bit her lip and closed her eyes.</p><p>Old memories Edgard thought he\u2019d buried long ago pushed to the surface. The taunts, jeers and accusations that\u2019d been hurled at him since he\u2019d turned thirteen. But Westin was so young, too young to understand why some kid he didn\u2019t know felt entitled to say shit like that to him.</p><p>Trevor scooted closer and took Westin\u2019s hand. \u201cCan I tell you a secret? I used to be one of them mean kids who said words like that, mostly because I didn\u2019t know what it meant. I said that kinda stuff because everyone else did. I\u2019m ashamed of that now. It was wrong; it is wrong. Faggot, fag, homo\u2014are all awful words that try to make love that\u2019s special sound wrong. Do I know if you\u2019ll fall in love with a boy or a girl when you\u2019re older? Nope. But no matter who you fall in love with son, your love, the way you feel, won\u2019t be wrong. And no one has the right to call you names for it.\u201d</p><p>A lump formed in Edgard\u2019s throat. There\u2019d been a time he never would\u2019ve believed that Trevor Glanzer was capable of feeling that way, let alone admitting it out loud.</p><p>\u201cMama, I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are. Give Daddy and Papai a hug and a kiss. Then I\u2019ll tuck you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Chass. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Trevor said and stood.</p><p>Westin clung to Chassie for a minute before he crawled off her lap and threw himself at Edgard. He squeezed the boy tightly and kissed the top of his head. \u201cLove you, son. I\u2019m glad you talked to us about this. You can talk to us about anything, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Papai.\u201d</p><p>He released the boy and Trevor scooped him up.</p><p>As soon as they left the kitchen, Chassie\u2019s tear-filled eyes met his. \u201cHow can we...?\u201d</p><p>Edgard lifted her onto his lap and cradled her to his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. Cry if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d he soothed. He held her, resting his chin on top of her head, knowing once her frustration ebbed, Mama Bear Chassie would roar.</p><p>Chassie stayed quiet, her breath hard and fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d he asked after a bit.</p><p>\u201cDag. Havin\u2019 to hide who he was. And you. Accepting who you were but havin\u2019 to hide it to be with Trevor. And Trevor. Lying to himself about bein\u2019 in love with a man. And me. Feeling smug because I have two men who love me. We decided to live the life we want, screw what anyone else thinks, right? Then I worry it\u2019s unfair to our kids because they\u2019ll have to deal with people around here who think we\u2019re freaks. We\u2014you, me and Trev\u2014we\u2019re somewhat isolated from those attitudes out here on the ranch. But Westin and Sophia and Max will have to face those attitudes every day when they go to school. I hate that this is just the start.\u201d She sighed heavily against his chest. \u201cHomeschooling them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs an option,\u201d Edgard inserted, \u201cbut it isn\u2019t something we need to worry about now. We answered Westin\u2019s question. We reiterated that love between two men isn\u2019t wrong, and neither is the love the three of us share. Most kids are lucky if they\u2019ve got one good parent. Our kids have three great parents. They\u2019ll grow up happy, Chass, because we won\u2019t let them be any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It just stings when those crap attitudes hit us in the face through our sweet son.\u201d She kissed the side of his throat. \u201cI love you. Thanks for talkin\u2019 me down and keeping me from crying. Lord. I\u2019ve been weepy lately.\u201d</p><p>Edgard tipped her chin up and looked into her eyes. \u201cIs there something else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d Trevor said as he entered the kitchen, \u201cbut I feel like beating the fuck outta my heavy bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWestin have any more questions for you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe sacked right out.\u201d He looked at Edgard. \u201cSo whatdya say, partner? Wanna go a few rounds?\u201d</p><p>As much as Edgard like sparring with Trevor, he wasn\u2019t feeling up to it tonight. And he didn\u2019t want to leave Chassie alone. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll get our woman tucked in and make sure she gets the rest she needs.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s eyes met his in understanding. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll be up in a bit.\u201d He ducked down the stairs leading to the basement.</p><p>Chassie stood. \u201cI need to shower first. So it\u2019s okay if you wanna go pound on Trev.\u201d</p><p>He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cAs much as I like pounding on him, maybe I\u2019d rather scrub your back. I\u2019m feeling a little dirty myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what else is new?\u201d They held hands as they climbed the stairs.</p><p>Their water games were mostly innocent. Edgard kneaded her tensed muscles. His relaxation techniques included caresses and soft kisses. He loved touching her, this woman who defined strength and softness. The depth of his feelings for her at the beginning of their relationship as a triad had surprised him. As did how easily and quickly they brought something to each other besides their love for Trevor.</p><p>She squinted at him. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at me funny, Ed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking about how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to get me to cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, querida, I\u2019m trying to get you to smile. \u2019Cause I know how much you love bein\u2019 reminded that me and Trev are wrapped around your little finger.\u201d</p><p>Chassie grinned. \u201cIt is good to be me.\u201d</p><p>After drying off and slipping on her pajamas, Chassie went to check on the kids one last time, like she always did, even if both he and Trevor had already checked them.</p><p>Then she crawled in bed and curled into him, like she did most nights. It\u2019d never bothered him that she\u2019d fall asleep in his arms and wake up in Trevor\u2019s arms since Trevor had to have a hand someplace on Edgard\u2019s body every night. A constant reassurance that he was really there.</p><p>Edgard started to drift off. He heard the shower kick on. Then the familiar scent of soap wafted out on a humid wave as Trevor exited the bathroom. The dresser drawer squeaked and he looked over to see Trevor slipping on a pair of flannel pants. Their days of sleeping in the nude had ended with three kids popping into their room any hour of the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So Edgard was really looking forward to the next three days and nights.</p><p>Trevor tucked his body behind Chassie\u2019s. He reached for Edgard, threading their fingers together and resting their joined hands on the pillow above Chassie\u2019s head.</p><p>All was right with his world and he let sleep overtake him.</p> <p>Rough Road: Chapter Two</p><p>The next morning Chassie had finished packing Westin\u2019s lunch when Edgard wandered into the kitchen. He gave her the brilliant, sexy grin that still weakened her knees. \u201cMornin\u2019, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019 yourself, sleepyhead. Why aren\u2019t you helping Trev with the feeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he had it handled.\u201d Edgard poured himself a cup of coffee.</p><p>Chassie glanced at the clock. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the kids up? Westin is gonna miss the bus if we don\u2019t leave in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s got a stomachache and he\u2019s not goin\u2019 to school today.\u201d</p><p>Her gut clenched. \u201cBecause of what was said to him at school yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Edgard curled his hand around her face and pressed a gentle kiss on her lips. \u201cHe did have a pained look, so I tucked him back in bed. Didn\u2019t see a reason to wake the other kids up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go check on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChass. Baby, I just did.\u201d He kissed her again and stepped back to sip his coffee. \u201cDid you deal with the goats this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She refilled her coffee cup and looked around the kitchen. Seemed weird the kids weren\u2019t up. Mornings were chaotic, but also her favorite part of the day. \u201cI think...\u201d She heard a noise and leaned over to look out the window. A car she didn\u2019t recognize had started up the driveway. \u201cWho on earth is dropping by at seven-thirty in the morning?\u201d</p> <p>The car parked next to the mini-van and a beautiful brunette stepped out. Her hair and makeup perfect; her clothing stylish and unwrinkled. \u201cOmigod. What is my cousin Ramona West doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for Edgard to respond, Chassie raced out of the house.</p><p>Ravishing Ramona paused at the edge of the walkway leading to the front door. She grinned and threw open her arms. \u201cLook at what the cat dragged in all the way from Seattle!\u201d</p><p>Chassie hugged her. \u201cYou look fantastic, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you. I see your men are taking great care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. So you could\u2019ve warned me you were comin\u2019 for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, that would\u2019ve ruined the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat surprise?\u201d</p> <p>The front door to the house opened, disgorging all three of their kids, who were jumping on Ramona like eager puppies. Chassie\u2019s eyes narrowed at Westin. \u201cSomeone wanna tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Max was running around yelling, \u201cSurprise, Mama, surprise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat surprise?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s hands were on her shoulders and Edgard flanked her. \u201cThe surprise that Ramona is here to stay with the kids for the weekend while we whisk you off to celebrate our anniversary.\u201d</p><p>Westin grinned. \u201cHad you fooled, huh Mama? You thought I was really sick.\u201d</p><p>She ruffled his hair, happy to see him smiling after last night\u2019s conversation. \u201cYes. So you were all in on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Sophie giggled. \u201cI\u2019m a good secret keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are.\u201d Chassie looked over and saw Edgard\u2019s truck backed up to the side door and luggage piled in the back. \u201cHow long have you two had this planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a month,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cWe asked Keely if she\u2019d take the kids for a weekend, and she mentioned it to Ramona, who had planned to be in Wyoming next week anyway. So she volunteered to come early.\u201d</p><p>Ramona leaned over and whispered, \u201cThree days of nonstop loud sex with these two hotties who worship you? I\u2019m more than a little jealous, cuz.\u201d She scooped Max up and perched him on her hip. \u201cI see the \u2018why would a single woman volunteer\u2019 question in your eyes and the truth is, I fear my brothers will never get married and give me nephews and nieces, so I\u2019m co-opting the Glanzer kids as mine.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. \u201cWorks for us since my family has disowned me and Ed\u2019s family is in Brazil. Oh, right, they disowned him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are stupid. Family is family. I hardly ever get to see Nick and Holly\u2019s kids, or Blake and Willow\u2019s boys. Boone is all grown up now\u2014I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s a senior in high school. And our McKay cousins...they\u2019ve already got ten million aunts and uncles. So the price of my child care duties is this: I expect to be called Aunt Ramona from here on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Aunt Ramona,\u201d Westin said.</p><p>\u201cBut we already call Keely Aunt Keely,\u201d Sophia added. \u201cAnd India Aunt India\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget I asked to be special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are special,\u201d Westin insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are the sweetest boy in the world.\u201d Ramona kissed his cheek. \u201cWe are gonna have some fun this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we.\u201d</p><p>Edgard aimed Chassie a hot look that made her belly swoop. \u201cYou\u2019ve got five minutes to get your toiletries packed and say goodbye to the kids before we hit the road.\u201d He shook his head when Chassie opened her mouth. \u201cAnd don\u2019t ask where we\u2019re goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be ready,\u201d Trevor added and lightly smacked her ass.</p><p>\u201cBut who\u2019s taking care of the livestock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt,\u201d Edgard and Trevor said simultaneously. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it handled. You\u2019re wasting time, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Chassie raced inside and tossed her bathroom stuff in a bag. What had the guys packed for her? Should she check to see they\u2019d packed enough?</p><p>Don\u2019t worry about it. Chances are high you\u2019ll be nekkid most the weekend anyway.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Six hours later they\u2019d reached their destination\u2014a remote cabin in Montana.</p><p>Trevor hoisted the last cooler out of the pickup bed. He and Edgard had decided it\u2019d be easiest to haul food with them, rather than trying to find a grocery store in the middle of nowhere. The last thing he wanted to do on this rare getaway was spend time buying groceries.</p><p>Inside the cabin, Edgard was putting the food away. He glanced over his shoulder at Trevor and grinned. \u201cThis is a great place. Where\u2019d you find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple guys I knew came up here huntin\u2019 every fall. Lucky for us this is this weekend before the season opens. Where\u2019s Chass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bedroom, checking to see what we packed for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat oughta take her all of two minutes.\u201d Trevor cut through the large living area to the hallway leading to the bedrooms. The master suite had a king-sized bed and a sitting area. He gave the windows that overlooked a small meadow a cursory glance before tracking Chassie to the master bath. The walk-in slate shower was enormous\u2014perfect for three.</p><p>Trevor leaned in the doorframe, watching Chassie paw through the toy bag. Without looking up, she said, \u201cWill we really need three vibrators this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Better to have too many than too few. And you, my sweet, darlin\u2019 wife, have too many clothes on. Strip.\u201d</p><p>Chassie rolled her eyes and then she brushed past him, setting the bag of sex toys on the floor.</p><p>Trevor followed her, stopping at the end of the bed.</p><p>Edgard moved in behind him, resting his chin on Trevor\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou heard him. Ditch the clothes.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cBut we\u2019ve only been here fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ve already wasted five of those minutes.\u201d Trevor\u2019s heart thumped when Edgard\u2019s hand splayed across his lower belly. \u201cThis retreat is to celebrate ten years of marriage and eight years of our commitment to Ed. Now we\u2019re a family, but I wanted us to reaffirm to each other what we are to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to what the three of us are to each other than awesome sex partners,\u201d Chassie shot back.</p><p>\u201cBut sex is part of who we are, and sometimes that connection gets lost in ranch chores, raising kids and other day-to-day stuff,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cAnd I, for one, am very curious as to what our Trevor has planned for us.\u201d</p><p>Chassie smirked. \u201cMe too. No doubt Mr. Bossy will tell us in explicit detail.\u201d</p><p>Trevor raised an eyebrow. \u201cI believe Mr. Bossy already told you to strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta disobey him,\u201d Edgard drawled, \u201c\u2019cause I surely would like to see some red marks across your ass. Been a while, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, Ed. Did you pack a crop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d Cassie grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m stripping, see?\u201d She whipped her sweatshirt off, then her tank top. Trevor loved that she hadn\u2019t worn a bra. She pushed her jeans and plain white panties down her legs, kicking them aside. Naked, she propped her hand on her hip. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>Edgard\u2019s hand moved and unbuttoned Trevor\u2019s jeans. His deft fingers slid the zipper down. One tug and Trevor\u2019s jeans and underwear fell to his knees.</p><p>Trevor shifted impatiently and kicked them off completely.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s demeanor changed as she watched them.</p><p>Something had changed with Trevor too; his cock was fully erect.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s hand gripped the base of Trevor\u2019s cock and stroked up, adding that twist at the end that had Trevor clenching his butt cheeks together.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was in charge,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d Edgard breathed in his ear sending a wave of want through him. \u201cTell me to stop.\u201d</p><p>Right. Like that\u2019d happen.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so,\u201d Edgard breathed again. \u201cTell us what you want.\u201d</p><p>Trevor crooked his finger at Chassie. \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>She was in front of him in an instant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEd, put my cock in her mouth.\u201d Trevor watched as Edgard painted the outline of her lips with the wet tip. Chassie\u2019s breath drifted over the sensitive head for a couple of heartbeats. And then his shaft was gliding into her warm, wet mouth, \u201cSweet Jesus that feels good.\u201d</p><p>Edgard waited several strokes until Chassie\u2019s mouth was wet enough that she could fully take Trevor\u2019s shaft. On the next pass, he didn\u2019t let her retreat. He held her head in place, her lips pressed against Trevor\u2019s groin, his dick filling her throat. \u201cSwallow,\u201d Edgard commanded. \u201cYou know how he likes it.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s eyes remained on Trevor\u2019s as her throat muscles worked him. And worked him again. And again.</p> <p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Trevor murmured and reached down to caress the hollow of her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so perfect in every way. I\u2019m so lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed and she sighed as she released his cock and started sliding her mouth up and down his shaft.</p><p>Then Edgard was unbuttoning Trevor\u2019s shirt and tugging it to his elbows. His hands skated across Trevor\u2019s torso. Stopping to tease all the hot spots that drove him wild. He hissed with pleasure when Edgard pinched his nipple the same time Chassie\u2019s teeth scraped the underside of his cockhead. His lovers knew him well. Knew how to make him shudder and moan. Knew how to make his knees weak and his head spin.</p><p>Knew how to make him feel loved.</p><p>What they brought to each other like this, stripped down, vulnerable\u2014nothing to hide behind\u2014was love in its purest form.</p> <p>Warm lips followed the cup of his shoulder to the sweet spot behind his ear. Another pair of warm lips circled the thick tip of his cock. They built a rhythm together and used it without pause to drive him to the brink.</p><p>As much as Trevor wanted to close his eyes and lose himself in these erotic sensations, he kept his eyes on his wife. Kept his left hand on her face and his right hand gripped Edgard\u2019s hip. Needing to stay connected in the moment. Because any moment he\u2019d fly apart.</p><p>\u201cTrev, let go. We\u2019ve got you,\u201d Edgard said against his nape, his heated breath raising gooseflesh.</p><p>\u201cFeels too damn good,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cThis is only the appetizer, meu amor.\u201d He ground his erection into the cleft of Trevor\u2019s ass.</p><p>Trevor turned his head and Edgard caught his lips in a flirty kiss. His mind blanked to everything except the hardness of Edgard\u2019s body against his and the softness of Chassie\u2019s hair wrapped in his fist. The fast, wet, suctioning pulls of her mouth on his dick. The nips and bites on the back of his neck and shoulder. He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>He started to come; ass tight, balls tight, teeth gritted. That first blast of heat shot up his dick into Chassie\u2019s sucking mouth. She swallowed each burst, her eyes locked to his. On the last spurt, she parted her lips and let his cock slide free, a satisfied smile on her face as she tongued the sensitive tip.</p><p>His entire body twitched. \u201cChrist, woman. That was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor speechless. I like that.\u201d She pushed to her feet and kissed the tattoo on his left pectoral. \u201cThat was fun. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to Edgard and then back to him. \u201cI want to watch Ed fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Trevor wiped come from the corner of her mouth with his thumb. \u201cYou do get off on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d Edgard brought Trevor\u2019s thumb to his mouth and licked it clean with such long, sensual strokes that Trevor\u2019s dick stirred again.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s really what you want?\u201d Trevor prompted Chassie.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She stood on tiptoe and kissed him. \u201cSince you brought vibrators, I can get myself off like two or three times while I\u2019m watching.\u201d She smirked and tugged off his shirt. \u201cBut I do ask that bein\u2019s we\u2019re not limited to the bedroom since our children aren\u2019t around, that you don\u2019t come quickly. Or quietly. I wanna hear you. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you.\u201d Trevor wrapped himself around her and kissed with heat and heart, with soul kisses that showed her that she owned him, body and soul.</p><p>Edgard retreated and gave them the moment.</p><p>When they broke apart, he grinned and pushed her on the bed. \u201cVibrators are fine. But this first go I\u2019m getting you off with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cLike I\u2019m gonna argue with that.\u201d</p><p>Trevor shoved her thighs apart and dove in, growling at the sweet taste of her. \u201cI love that you\u2019re so wet after blowing me.\u201d</p><p>Chassie arched when he jammed his tongue inside her deep. She writhed when he pushed his thumb into her pussy so he could insistently tongue her clit. Little whips, first soft and slow, and then hard and fast. Sucking kisses. Firm-lipped bites.</p><p>The way her body vibrated he knew she teetered on the edge. He enclosed that swollen nub between his lips and lashed it with his tongue until she came in a wet rush, all over his face.</p><p>Trevor eased back. Kissing the insides of her thighs. Brushing his mouth between her hipbones. \u201cChass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. Let me get my brain back online.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He stood and ran his hands down the lean length of her body. \u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not too much time,\u201d Edgard said from the doorway.</p><p>A shudder worked down Trevor\u2019s body at the hungry look on Edgard\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhy you still wearing clothes?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cGot distracted watching you two.\u201d</p><p>Chassie pushed up on her elbows and looked at Edgard. \u201cSince Ed\u2019s the only one dressed, I think he oughta give us a strip tease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019 a mite bossy for a man I\u2019m about to bend over a chair and fuck hard.\u201d</p><p>Trevor crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll act submissive if it\u2019ll get you nekkid faster.\u201d</p><p>Edgard flashed a predatory smile. \u201cYou bein\u2019 submissive to me won\u2019t be an act.\u201d He unsnapped the pearl buttons one at a time until his entire chest was exposed. He shrugged out of the shirt, letting it flutter to the floor. He turned on his heel and walked into the living room.</p><p>Behind him he heard the bed squeak and the crack of skin on flesh, followed by Chassie\u2019s yelp. Yeah, he\u2019d wanted to smack that smooth butt of hers too.</p><p>He paused between the coffee table and the recliner. When Chassie and Trevor appeared, he pointed to the chair. \u201cThat\u2019s where you are, sweet Chass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. No matter where you guys end up, I\u2019ve got a front row seat.\u201d Her tits bounced nicely when she dropped in the chair. \u201cOoh and you already set the vibrators out. Thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d Edgard sat on the edge of the coffee table and stretched his legs out. \u201cHow about you get on your knees...\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd start by takin\u2019 my boots off?\u201d</p><p>Trevor ambled over and dropped to his knees. He cupped his palm beneath the heel of Edgard\u2019s right boot and tugged. He threw the boot behind him and reached for Edgard\u2019s left foot. One tug and that boot joined the other. Socks were next. Then Trevor crawled between his legs. He placed his hands beside Edgard\u2019s on the coffee table and got in Edgard\u2019s face. \u201cDo I gotta ask permission before I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod I love this mouth. I can\u2019t get enough of it.\u201d Trevor\u2019s lips were soft and yielding, not at all the brutal, impatient kiss Edgard had expected. As Trevor continued to blow his mind with the seductive glide of lips on lips, his hands went to Edgard\u2019s belt. He unbuckled and unzipped him without changing the dreamy quality of the kiss.</p><p>Trevor eased his lips back to say, \u201cLift your hips.\u201d</p><p>Edgard pressed upward, his pelvis bumping into Trevor\u2019s.</p><p>Trevor dragged Edgard\u2019s jeans down and off. He hooked his fingers into Edgard\u2019s boxer briefs and pulled them off. \u201cGuess I like stripping you better than you stripping for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works.\u201d Edgard\u2019s breath caught when Trevor\u2019s callused hands roamed over his chest and belly while that hot mouth attacked his left nipple, stopping to trace the tattoo on his left pectoral. He chanced a quick look at Chassie to see she\u2019d started stroking herself.</p><p>Trevor sucked and bit and used his skilled tongue on Edgard\u2019s upper body, knowing the places that made him moan, made him hard and made him beg. Keeping his sexy blue-eyed gaze on Edgard\u2019s, he kissed down his torso. He stopped when the wet tip of Edgard\u2019s cock bumped his chin. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me deep in your throat and hold me there. Like I had Chassie do to you.\u201d</p><p>A half-growl rumbled from Trevor a second before he sucked Edgard\u2019s cock into his mouth. Each bob of Trevor\u2019s head pulled the shaft deeper. The tip bumping his soft palate, gliding back over his tongue and teeth, then past the gag reflex until his full lips circled the root of Edgard\u2019s cock. \u201cI love it when you\u2019re on your knees and my dick is buried in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Trevor swallowed in response.</p><p>Edgard groaned. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>He complied. Then he released Edgard\u2019s cock slowly. \u201cScoot to the edge.\u201d</p><p>The instant Edgard moved, Trevor sucked Edgard\u2019s sac. That deep suctioning tug caused Edgard to moan. Then that wicked tongue slipped down and back to lap at his asshole. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love this.\u201d Trevor teased the pucker with wet swirls before pushing his tongue into the hole, fucking him with short jabs.</p><p>\u201cGod. Damn.\u201d</p><p>Trevor slid his hands up Edgard\u2019s thighs. \u201cTurn around and brace your hands on the coffee table. I need a better angle.\u201d</p><p>Edgard stood on shaking legs, widening his stance as Trevor grabbed hold of each butt cheek, squeezing and caressing as he tongued him straight to heaven.</p><p>\u201cYou two should see how hot you look during a rim job. So fuckin\u2019 sexy. Gets me off every time.\u201d The buzz of the vibrator got louder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor didn\u2019t pause at all in his licking, tongue thrusting and the soft smooches. He just drove Edgard out of his fucking mind with the erotic way his mouth worked him.</p><p>Chassie gasped and emitted a series of breathy moans, her eyes locked on them as she masturbated herself to orgasm.</p><p>Then Trevor\u2019s lips followed the crack of Edgard\u2019s ass, up his spine, to his nape. Edgard loved the feel of Trevor\u2019s full weight on him, pinning him down. Trevor pushed his erection between Edgard\u2019s balls and rubbed their cocks together.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to fuck you?\u201d Trevor murmured in his ear.</p><p>\u201cLater. Grab the lube.\u201d</p><p>Trevor lifted up, giving Edgard one hip slap before moving.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to use that crop on you, Trev?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d have to wrestle me for it and we both know how that always turns out. Where are we doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>When he turned around, holding the lube, Edgard was right there. \u201cOn the floor. I want rug burns on your knees so you remember who put them there.\u201d</p><p>A dark look entered Trevor\u2019s eyes. \u201cLike I could ever forget, amigo. Who you are to me, what you do to me. Inside and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet words won\u2019t get you sweet lovin\u2019, my man.\u201d Edgard kissed him hard and snatched the lube. \u201cHands and knees.\u201d</p><p>Trevor dropped to the carpet. Edgard heard Chassie move behind them. He squirted a generous amount of lube on his fingers and coated his cock. He reached out and smacked Trevor\u2019s ass. \u201cTilt your hips up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you called me Mr. Bossy,\u201d he said to Chassie, who\u2019d perched on the edge of the coffee table, vibrator in hand, to watch.</p><p>Chassie snorted. \u201cYou love it when he\u2019s like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>Edgard added more lube to his fingers and smeared it around Trevor\u2019s asshole. Pushing one finger inside, he rubbed the tip across Trevor\u2019s prostate as his mouth worshiped Trevor\u2019s strong back. He loved the way the muscles bunched and relaxed beneath his tongue and teeth. He loved that beneath Trevor\u2019s musky scent, Edgard could still smell Chassie on his skin.</p><p>\u201cHow long you gonna tease me?\u201d Trevor demanded.</p><p>\u201cAs long as I want.\u201d More lube, another finger, and Edgard was about to burst out of his skin with the need to get inside that tight ass.</p><p>He poised his cock at the soft pucker and said, \u201cI wanna hear you as I fuck you,\u201d and rammed his cock deep on the first thrust.</p><p>Trevor groaned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d His balls swung forward with every hard snap of his hips. Feeling the squeeze of that narrow passage as he withdrew completely. Circling the tip around that stretched opening and slamming in fully over and over.</p><p>Edgard curled his hands around Trevor\u2019s shoulders to give himself leverage. He canted his hips, dragging his cock over Trevor\u2019s prostate on every pass.</p> <p>And his man loved it rough like this. He made masculine-sounding whimpers, but they were whimpers nonetheless.</p><p>Edgard looked down, watching his cock pounding into Trevor\u2019s ass. And what an ass. Round, high and firm. The man filled out a pair of Wranglers and then some.</p><p>He tried to stave off his orgasm, because it felt so fucking good. He layered his chest to Trevor\u2019s back. His pelvis pumping, his mouth grazing Trevor\u2019s ear. \u201cI can go another ten minutes if I slow down and have my hips do all the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, goddamn you. I wanna hear you come. I want the satisfaction of knowing what I do to you.\u201d</p><p>Edgard grinned and licked the shell of his ear. \u201cI lied. I\u2019ll be lucky if I last another ten seconds as I\u2019m about to blow. Are you hard again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yes. Every time you do that...\u201d Trevor\u2019s words were lost on a moan as Edgard did the twisting maneuver with his hips anyway.</p><p>A sheen of sweat covered them both. Edgard wanted to flip Trevor on his back, push his legs up by his ears and look into his gorgeous face as he pumped into him. But his orgasm was too close. His need too sharp this first time.</p><p>He pushed upright again and gripped Trevor\u2019s waist, pulling his body back to meet every hard thrust. \u201cChass,\u201d he panted. \u201cBe ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see his face, Edgard,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSo lost to what you\u2019re doin\u2019 to him.\u201d</p><p>That tipped him over the edge.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s channel clamped down on Edgard\u2019s cock as he started to come. \u201cGive it to me. Harder.\u201d</p><p>He roared as he poured every bit of hot seed into Trevor until his balls were drained.</p><p>Shadows wavered in the sunlight, dancing across his face in a strobe-light effect, giving the moment a surreal, dreamlike quality. He had a temporary sense of panic that this wasn\u2019t real. But the rhythmic clasp of Trevor\u2019s ass around his cock, the heat and hardness of his lover\u2019s body beneath him, and Chassie\u2019s soft hand caressing his shoulder grounded him. Reminding him this wasn\u2019t a dream. This was his life. Their life.</p><p>Edgard grabbed hold of Trevor\u2019s hair and cranked his head around so he could take his mouth. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said between ferocious kisses. \u201cSo fucking much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Trevor gave those ravenous kisses right back to him. \u201cI need...\u201d</p><p>Then Chassie was there, her chest against Trevor\u2019s, her mouth working the cords straining in his throat. \u201cI know what you need.\u201d She slipped her hands between Edgard and Trevor\u2019s bodies to where they were still joined. Pressing her thumbs into Edgard\u2019s hips she pushed him back.</p><p>Edgard eased out of the tight heat slowly. Before Trevor could pin Chassie to the floor and plow into her like a madman, Edgard grabbed her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cHands and knees for you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and Trevor caged her small body beneath his, his hips pumping ferociously as he fucked her. He threw his head back and shouted, his body shuddering as he came.</p><p>As soon as Trevor\u2019s body stilled, Edgard crawled in front of Chassie. He placed the vibrator directly on her clit. \u201cNow come for me.\u201d He swallowed her surprised gasp in a consuming kiss, and didn\u2019t back off until she unraveled between them again.</p><p>They all three slumped to the floor in a sweaty, sticky, spent pile. After they\u2019d caught their breath Chassie asked, \u201cSo how are we gonna spend the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>A few hours later, after exploring the outdoor area and another round of hot sex, they put on robes and returned to the kitchen to cook supper.</p><p>Trevor had gotten better over the years with cooking. He grilled a mean steak. While he manned the grill, Edgard fried potatoes and heated a frozen bag of corn.</p><p>\u201cI feel useless,\u201d Chassie complained.</p><p>\u201cThen set the table. I think there are actual glass glasses in the cabinet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will we get through dinner with no plastic cartoon cups?\u201d</p><p>After all the food was on the table, they looked at each other and grinned. \u201cWell ain\u2019t this fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo ketchup or ranch dressing. And we don\u2019t have to cut up anyone\u2019s food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven our picky eater Sophia would\u2019ve eaten this,\u201d Trevor mused.</p><p>\u201cThe steak is cooked perfectly, Trev.\u201d</p><p>He smirked at Edgard. \u201cI know exactly how you like your meat.\u201d</p><p>They snickered like twelve-year-old boys and Chassie rolled her eyes.</p><p>The silence as they ate was nice for a change, since mealtimes at home were always loud.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time we had a meal in our robes,\u201d Chassie said.</p><p>Trevor swallowed a mouthful of beer. \u201cMaybe when you were tryin\u2019 to get pregnant that first time and we were goin\u2019 at it everywhere, all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, probably not a good thing to tell Westin that he was conceived in the dining room.\u201d</p><p>Edgard noticed Chassie had been picking at her corn more than eating it. \u201cSomething wrong, querida?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here alone with you guys, but I\u2019ll admit I do miss the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do we, sweetheart.\u201d Trevor reached for her hand. \u201cI know it\u2019ll put your mind at ease to call them before bedtime to see how they\u2019re doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She lifted his hand and kissed it. \u201cThank you. Now that that\u2019s out of the way, what else do you have planned for tonight?\u201d</p><p>Edgard wiped his mouth and set his napkin aside. \u201cWe brought a couple of movies\u2014non-cartoon stuff we\u2019ve been wanting to watch but don\u2019t have time for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could play cribbage,\u201d Trevor offered.</p><p>\u201cOr we could just pile onto the couch and watch TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would that be any different than a night at home?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cMax wouldn\u2019t be running around yelling, \u2018Mama, Mama watch me,\u2019 while he\u2019s throwing toys everywhere,\u201d Trevor said dryly.</p><p>Edgard nodded. \u201cAnd we wouldn\u2019t be checking Westin\u2019s homework, finishing laundry, working on scheduling goat milk transportation and cattle shipment times, while combing out Sophia\u2019s hair and wrestling Max and Westin into the tub\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I get it. Tonight will be more sedate,\u201d Chassie said, standing and carrying her plate to the sink.</p><p>\u201cPlus, we won\u2019t have to share our popcorn with the little popcorn hogs.\u201d Edgard hip-checked her away from the sink. \u201cThe movies are in the bag in the bedroom. Pick one while Trev and I finish the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys cooked and are cleaning up? I really am on vacation.\u201d</p><p>Trevor snapped her ass with a dishtowel. \u201cKeep it up, smarty-pants and you will feel that crop tonight.\u201d</p><p>After stowing the leftovers in the fridge, Edgard filled the sink with water and washed while Trevor dried.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I forgot to mention after all that bullshit happened with Westin at school. I ran into Colby earlier that day when I was picking up groceries. He asked if Westin was entered in the mutton bustin\u2019 event at the 4-H fundraiser next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Edgard looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat we\u2019d talk about it. But to be honest, I don\u2019t wanna bring it up unless Westin asks us about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not sure I want him involved in the sport of rodeo at all.\u201d Trevor leaned against the counter. \u201cYou know my Dad didn\u2019t give me a choice. And with you and me bein\u2019 on the circuit as professionals, I don\u2019t want Westin to feel he\u2019s gotta live up to something that we only enjoyed the last few years because we got to be together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid he thinks we\u2019ll be disappointed in him if he doesn\u2019t at least try it and carry on some kind of family tradition in rodeo?\u201d</p><p>Trevor nodded. \u201cOr worse...what if he tries it and likes it? I mean, we both just disappeared off the circuit. But guaranteed if Westin starts ropin\u2019, his last name will create interest. Which will lead to buzz, rumors, and all that bullshit we\u2019re tryin\u2019 to avoid. Especially when folks in the rodeo world learn that you changed your last name to Glanzer and we\u2019re living together with Chassie West. That\u2019ll bring up Dag, too.\u201d He shifted his stance. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of our life, but we do keep a low profile. Putting our kid in the rodeo arena probably ain\u2019t the best thing to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>Edgard frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t disagree. Has Westin expressed interest in rodeoin\u2019 to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned his cousins\u2014Colby\u2019s, Cord\u2019s and Cam\u2019s boys\u2014are competing in a few events this fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p> <p>Trevor\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds to me like he was testing the waters to see what you\u2019d say. We can point out that it\u2019s doubtful Colt and Indy will let their boys compete. Westin worships Boone and Boone ain\u2019t a rodeo cowboy, so we can add that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ed, you\u2019re missing the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Edgard closed the distance between them. \u201cYou are. If he wants to try it, we\u2019ll let him try it. If we tell him no, he\u2019s gonna want to do it even more. Much as we\u2019d like to plan for every variable in our kids\u2019 lives, we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Trevor hooked the towel around Edgard\u2019s neck and tugged. \u201cYou are one smart bastard.\u201d He smashed his lips to Edgard\u2019s in a punishing kiss.</p><p>Edgard lightly punched Trevor in the gut to break the lip lock. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get these dishes done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShould we bring this up with Chassie?\u201d Trevor asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNot unless Westin expresses real interest in the sport. Our Chass worries enough as it is. And with what happened at school this week...well, I say leave it be. Let\u2019s focus on why we\u2019re here this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Trevor grinned. \u201cSex. Lots and lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>A loud, \u201cOmigod, are you serious?\u201d echoed from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she found the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man, I\u2019m blaming you that the only thing we brought was porn.\u201d</p><p>Later the next afternoon they were lazing in bed after a long and sweaty bout of sex. There\u2019d been a certain sweetness having Edgard between them. Edgard making love to Chassie slowly from behind, whispering Portuguese against her neck as Trevor fucked Edgard at the same leisurely pace, his mouth and hands in constant motion on both of them.</p><p>So basking in the afterglow between her men was the perfect time to state her intent. \u201cI wanna have another baby.\u201d</p> <p>Both her men propped up on an elbow and looked at her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about havin\u2019 four kids. If we are serious, I want to do it soon. Max is already two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how soon, sweetheart?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cI go in next month for my annual checkup. I\u2019d like to get my IUD taken out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we had another baby, the kids would outnumber us,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cOur little Max is a handful. More so than Westin and Sophia put together. Makes me wonder what kind of hellion kid four would be.\u201d</p><p>Trevor chuckled and Chassie elbowed him in the gut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I miss havin\u2019 a baby in the house. I think about holding one, rocking one, how good they smell and seeing that sweet little happy face first thing every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting the lack of sleep, the constant crying, one of us always bein\u2019 tethered at home, and Chass, that\u2019s usually you. Plus, we\u2019ve still got Max in diapers.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s gaze moved from Trevor\u2019s face to Edgard\u2019s. \u201cYou\u2019re both against it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d they said simultaneously. \u201cI just think we oughta make sure you wanna have another baby for the right reasons,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell us.\u201d Edgard\u2019s golden-brown eyes were so serious.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothin\u2019 to do with what that shithead said to Westin at school this week,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d She placed a hand on each of their cheeks. \u201cWe make beautiful, smart, compassionate human beings. It\u2019s been shown to us time and time again that the world could use more kids like ours. Especially where we live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a sweet talker,\u201d Trevor drawled.</p><p>\u201cThat she is,\u201d Edgard agreed.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I really feel that one more child would make our family complete.\u201d</p><p>Trevor and Edgard exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cStop doin\u2019 that,\u201d she said poking them both in the chest. \u201cYou have something to say, spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like you need to even it up for my benefit?\u201d Trevor asked. \u201cBecause biologically, two of our kids are Edgard\u2019s and one is mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Chassie inhaled. Exhaled. \u201cOkay, maybe. Look, the only reason we had paternity tests done was to set up the legal guardianship in case something happened to one of us or two of us, so there wasn\u2019t any chance the kids could get separated by the courts. We\u2019ve never treated any of the kids like anything but ours\u2014all of ours. And when we were tryin\u2019 to get pregnant, we let nature take its course\u2014no selective breeding.\u201d</p><p>Edgard groaned and Trevor laughed.</p><p>\u201cBut this time, if we decide we\u2019re all on board havin\u2019 another baby, I would like for Trev to have first crack at providing the fastest swimmers.\u201d She leaned over and kissed each of them. \u201cI love you both. I wanna have another baby with you both. I just wanted to bring this up before my appointment and when we don\u2019t have kids underfoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that might change our minds about adding another one to the chaos?\u201d Edgard said dryly.</p><p>\u201cNot funny.\u201d Chassie flicked his chest.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I\u2019d like to point out is if we do add to our family, we\u2019ll also need to add to our house. We\u2019re busting out of the bedrooms upstairs. And bein\u2019 here,\u201d Edgard gestured to the generous space around them, \u201cjust shows that I wouldn\u2019t mind havin\u2019 a bigger place like this for us all the time.\u201d</p><p>Trevor scratched his chin, a faraway look in his eyes. \u201cYou know, I have been thinking about this. If we added a master suite off the living room, we\u2019d have to install plumbing for the big bathroom with a gigantic shower that I know Chass is dyin\u2019 to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I heard the two of you enjoying the gigantic shower here yesterday. Really enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping. We were bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you gotta be bored to fuck me, Brazil nut? That\u2019s reassuring.\u201d</p><p>Edgard leaned over and kissed Trevor. \u201cChass just attested to the fact I enjoyed it, so lose the pout.\u201d</p><p>Some days Chassie found it hard to believe there was no jealousy between the three of them. From the start they\u2019d made certain that even the smallest perceived slight would be addressed by all of them immediately.</p><p>Although they spent the majority of their time in and out of bed as a trio, they also made sure they got couple time too\u2014her with each of them individually and them with each other. No one ever got the short end of the stick, in love, in bed, in parenting, or in being an equal member of the household. She was so very thankful every day that it worked.</p><p>She tuned back into the conversation as Trevor said, \u201cSince we\u2019re already adding new plumbing, then we could add a ground floor laundry room, which would make everything easier.\u201d</p><p>Edgard nodded. \u201cThen we could finish the basement, wall off a bedroom or two and turn it into a kids\u2019 area, since our dining room and living room are bein\u2019 overrun with toys.\u201d</p><p>Trevor pushed a hank of Chassie\u2019s hair over her shoulder. \u201cI agree with Ed. I think it\u2019s time we had a bigger space for the three of us. We\u2019re conscious of kids overhearing when we\u2019re getting down and dirty, so creating a separate area would give us privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019ll give Chet and Remy a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me do it?\u201d Trevor asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot me\u2019n Ed can do ourselves and that\u2019ll affect the cost, even with the West family discount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does that mean yes to another baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we\u2019d ever say no to you. It helps your case that you\u2019re such an outstanding mama. And that you\u2019re not a psycho pregnant woman,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>\u201cBut childbirth does take a toll on my body. Stretch marks on my tits, my ass, my belly and my hips. Not to mention I turn into a nympho or act like a nun\u2014with no options in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stretch marks are beautiful to me,\u201d Trevor said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd to me,\u201d Edgard said. He traced the jagged white lines beneath her left breast. \u201cYou fed our babies with these, Chass. It\u2019s an amazing thing your body can do. It should show the changes because you\u2019ve\u2014we\u2019ve all\u2014changed with each child.\u201d Then his fingers followed the intertwined the letters C, T and E tattoo centered above her left breast\u2014the exact same tattoo both he and Trevor had in the exact same spot on their bodies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI loved how round you got with each pregnancy.\u201d Trevor let his fingers drag across her lower belly. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle. Three miracles. So don\u2019t ever think we\u2019re lookin\u2019 at you with anything besides love, admiration and lust. It\u2019s humbling what this body can still do to me every time I look at you or touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here, querida. Mr. Smooth said it all right for a change.\u201d</p><p>Chassie closed her eyes...overwhelmed by her love for them.</p> <p>Trevor gathered her against his chest. \u201cHey. No cryin\u2019 allowed. Why don\u2019t we all just stay right here and nap for a little longer? There\u2019s no reason to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. So we don\u2019t have any big plans for tonight?\u201d she asked with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cWe do have a few movies left to watch,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cRight, we didn\u2019t make it through the first one before we were all on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. But, man, it\u2019s been a few years since we\u2019ve gone at it this hard.\u201d</p><p>Edgard kissed her eyelids. \u201cSo you\u2019d probably better rest up, huh?\u201d</p><p>The next morning Chassie had managed to shampoo her hair and shave before she was joined in the big shower by both her men.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve been talkin\u2019,\u201d Trevor started.</p><p>Her gaze zeroed in on their crotches, one at a time. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been doin\u2019 more than talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Edgard poured body wash in his hands and created lather. Then he began soaping the front side of her body, starting at her collarbones. His soft, sure lips moved from the tip of her chin up the side of her jaw.</p> <p>Her entire body became a mass of gooseflesh.</p><p>Then Trevor\u2019s body was snugged up behind hers, his mouth on her ear. \u201cWe had plans for you this morning before we have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this will work too,\u201d Edgard murmured in her other ear.</p><p>\u201cSo just relax and let us take care of you.\u201d Trevor\u2019s mouth skated along the arch of her neck.</p><p>Chassie sighed and closed her eyes. She loved everything about the three of them being together, but when they double-teamed her like this, focused entirely on her pleasure, well, it reminded her of how lucky she was.</p><p>Slippery hands caressed her body, front and back.</p><p>\u201cI love how your skin smells. Not only because you use this honey, goat\u2019s milk, and lavender body wash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is pretty cool that Sky Blue uses so much of our goat milk in their products. I never thought I could make such a good living selling\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally, Chass? We\u2019re all three nekkid together in this shower and you\u2019re talking business?\u201d Trevor admonished with mock outrage.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I surrender to you both completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d Edgard whispered, sending goose bumps cascading down her body. \u201cClose your eyes. Let us take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Every touch, every kiss, sent her deeper into that fuzzy white void where they owned her completely. She trusted them with everything she had, with everything she was.</p><p>\u201cHands on the wall, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Trevor entered her from behind, angling her slightly forward as she braced herself against the shower wall. His hands continued that constant stroking as he slid in and out of her pussy; his mouth busy teasing the back of her neck.</p><p>Then Edgard dropped to his knees.</p><p>Her knees nearly buckled when his tongue began tracing her slit, top to bottom, circling her clit. \u201cOh God this feels so good.\u201d</p><p>When Trevor pulled out and paused, she felt Edgard\u2019s tongue licking the head of Trevor\u2019s cock, then switching to swirl his tongue around the opening to her sex.</p><p>Trevor growled against her nape, slowing down so Edgard could tease them both.</p><p>Chassie started to drift, the steam from the shower returning her to that hazy state, Trevor sending her to another plane with his mouth, his hands and his cock.</p><p>When Edgard zigzagged his tongue back up her slit, her belly performed a slow, delicious roll. He spread the fleshy skin covering her clit and settled his mouth there until she came against his flickering tongue and sucking lips.</p><p>Her body still was quaking when Edgard stood and pulled her against him. Mashed between two wet, hard male bodies caused her sex to clench around Trevor\u2019s hard shaft.</p><p>Edgard and Trevor shared a long, sexy kiss.</p><p>After Edgard pulled away, Trevor growled, \u201cShe tastes good on you.\u201d</p><p>Chassie curled her hands around Edgard\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI need to fuck you, Chass,\u201d he said against her lips. \u201cWith Trev. Right here, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Trevor pulled out of her body and backed away.</p><p>Before she lodged a protest, Edgard said, \u201cJump up. Legs around my waist.\u201d Grabbing her butt cheeks, he gave her a boost. Then they were indulging in those drugging kisses.</p><p>Chassie threaded her hands through Edgard\u2019s dark hair, holding him close and tight enough to feel his heart pounding against hers.</p><p>A cool and slippery finger circled her anus as a warm mouth sucked the droplets of water from her shoulder. Then the slick digit pressed against the opening and slipped inside.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s breaths were short and choppy across her skin as he worked more lube into her ass, using two fingers. \u201cReady to take both of us, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d A tingle of anticipation unfurled low in her belly as they aligned their cocks.</p><p>Both men released a hiss of pleasure when the tips of their cocks rubbed together. They pushed inside her with a simultaneous thrust. She moaned, loving that immediate feeling of fullness with a sharp bite of pain.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good, Chassie,\u201d Trevor murmured in her ear. \u201cTight and hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarm and wet,\u201d Edgard added in her other ear.</p><p>Trevor moved and Edgard countered the move. Slow, slow, slow and then four rapid-fire thrusts as he bottomed out in her ass. Edgard would keep the same maddeningly steady pace...and then jackhammer into her pussy like a man possessed.</p><p>Chassie\u2019s entire body was awash in sensation. Inside. Outside. Hands, mouths, cocks. Teeth on her skin. Fingers pinching her nipples. The muscular heat of Trevor\u2019s body behind her. The grinding thrusts of Edgard\u2019s pelvis against her clit. She was suspended between them. Bent to their will. Their bodies working in tandem and in opposition to make her fly apart.</p><p>Edgard kissed her. Then Trevor angled her head to kiss her. Then three mouths met and it shouldn\u2019t have worked, but it did. It was erotic as hell.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby, I know it\u2019s right there,\u201d Edgard panted. \u201cI can feel your body vibrating. You know how this goes. We don\u2019t come until you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019ll get her there.\u201d Trevor grabbed a fistful of her wet hair and pulled.</p><p>The sharp sting on her scalp and Trevor\u2019s mouth sucking on the spot below her ear was like a jolt of electricity. She arched and cried out, \u201cHarder. Faster. So close.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of their heavy breathing bounced off the shower walls as their cocks powered into her, creating the most amazing friction.</p><p>Chassie drew one breath before she unraveled. Her cunt spasmed around Edgard\u2019s cock and her anal muscles clamped down on Trevor\u2019s shaft. The throbbing pulses so intense she held her breath. As the last twinge faded, twin grunts echoed. Trevor\u2019s pelvis slammed into her butt as he spilled heat in her ass.</p><p>Edgard\u2019s cock remained buried deep, his hips bumping short jabs as he came in hot spurts.</p><p>Trevor rested his forehead on her right shoulder and Edgard rested his forehead on her left shoulder. Her pulse still raced and her body quaked from aftershocks when she kissed Trevor\u2019s temple and then Edgard\u2019s. \u201cThat was...spectacular. Thank you.\u201d She whispered, \u201cI love you,\u201d to each man, nuzzling ears and necks.</p><p>They lifted their heads and looked at each other with cocky grins.</p><p>\u201cI definitely think we need to build a shower like this at home.\u201d</p><p>Rough Road: Chapter Three</p><p>Two days after returning to Sundance, Chassie was cleaning Max up after lunch, when the phone rang. Caller ID said, Moorcroft Elem. She answered quickly. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Glanzer? This is Patricia Donkle. I\u2019m the school counselor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Westin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was involved in an altercation on the playground. He hit another student.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cWhere is Westin now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in my office. I\u2019ve called the parents of the other student who was involved. School policy is a face-to-face meeting. How soon can you be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen or twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Just check in at the front office.\u201d</p><p>Chassie hung up. Max had stopped pounding on his high chair tray and looked ready to crash since it was close to his naptime.</p><p>Trevor and Sophia bounded in, Sophia chattering a million miles an hour, Edgard bringing up the rear. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise that Edgard noticed her distress first.</p><p>\u201cChassie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school called. Westin has been involved in a playground incident. So the counselor has asked me to come to the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her mind raced. \u201cSo if you\u2019ll get Max down for his nap, I\u2019ll go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019ll all go.\u201d Edgard spoke to Sophia. \u201cCan you get Max\u2019s coat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She skipped off.</p><p>\u201cNow you wanna tell us what\u2019s really goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you everything I know. The other kid\u2019s parents will be there.\u201d She lifted Max out of the high chair. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier if one of us stayed here with the younger kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one of us stays?\u201d Trevor demanded.</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cWe all go,\u201d Trevor reiterated.</p><p>The ride into town was quiet\u2014even Sophia and Max were subdued.</p><p>They traipsed into the school and signed in at the office before being directed down a long hallway. A heavyset woman, probably mid-fifties, exited the office marked Counselor. \u201cHi, Mrs. Glanzer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Patricia Donkle.\u201d The counselor\u2019s gaze moved between Edgard and Trevor before returning to Chassie. \u201cAnd they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWestin\u2019s fathers. Trevor and Edgard Glanzer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s...good you\u2019re all here. We\u2019re in these two rooms.\u201d</p><p>Max had started to fuss so Trevor plucked him out of Chassie\u2019s arms and carried him. Sophia remained close to Edgard.</p><p>As soon as the door to the conference room opened, Westin ran to Chassie, burying his face against her stomach.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetie.\u201d She tried to push him back but he wouldn\u2019t budge; he\u2019d curled himself around her completely. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>Westin shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you all have a seat? I\u2019ll bring in the other parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d prefer if you\u2019d fill us in about what\u2019s goin\u2019 on first,\u201d Edgard said.</p><p>Chassie chose a seat at the end of the table and Trevor and Edgard flanked her, keeping the kids on their laps.</p><p>\u201cEvidently one of our students has been saying inappropriate things to Westin. A situation none of us were aware of. But I learned today that it\u2019s been going on for a couple of days. Isn\u2019t that right, Westin?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe boy is two grades older and Westin had been ignoring him, but things escalated today. Westin, would you please tell your parents what happened?\u201d</p> <p>Westin kept his gaze focused on the carpet. \u201cRobbie followed me around the playground yelling that my family was all faggots. So I punched him. And I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m not! He\u2019s mean.\u201d He dissolved into tears again.</p><p>Cassie looked to Edgard and Trevor for support. They were as shocked as she. None of them knew what to say.</p><p>\u201cSo, you understand why we need to deal with this matter as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Chassie pulled Westin away from where he was clinging to her neck.</p><p>The counselor opened the adjoining door.</p><p>A man, woman and young boy entered, taking seats as far from them as possible.</p><p>The woman\u2019s lip curled as she looked at the three of them. She turned her head and whispered behind her hand in her husband\u2019s ear.</p><p>The pudgy boy knuckled away a tear and glared at Westin.</p> <p>\u201cMr. and Mrs. Feckling have demanded Westin apologize to Robbie.\u201d</p><p>Chassie\u2019s arms tightened around Westin. \u201cWestin will apologize as long as Robbie also apologizes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Mrs. Feckling demanded. \u201cThat boy hit my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your son bullied mine. On more than one occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is outrageous.\u201d Mrs. Feckling addressed the counselor. \u201cAn apology is off the table. We want that little freak suspended from school. Who knows what else might set him off and he\u2019ll start swinging again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son has been calling Westin\u2019s family horrid names for several days, Mrs. Feckling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t give him the right to use his fists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even to defend himself against a bigger, meaner boy?\u201d Chassie snapped.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should grow thicker skin,\u201d the woman sneered. \u201cRobbie didn\u2019t say anything that isn\u2019t true.\u201d Her piggy-eyed gaze moved between Chassie, Edgard and Trevor and she shuddered. \u201cYou live a perverted lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur lifestyle isn\u2019t the issue here,\u201d Edgard said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is your son is a bully. And I\u2019ll bet this is not the first time you\u2019ve been called into the school to deal with his behavior.\u201d He looked at the counselor and she nodded.</p><p>Mr. Feckling said nothing as Mrs. Feckling kept yapping. \u201cWhat gives you the right to question our\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough out of you. Cut to the chase,\u201d Trevor said to the school counselor, cutting off Mrs. Feckling\u2019s diatribe. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a zero-tolerance policy for violence, so Westin is looking at a two-day suspension from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPraise the Lord something makes sense around here.\u201d Mrs. Feckling patted Robbie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSee? I told you we\u2019d handle it.\u201d</p><p>Robbie smirked.</p><p>Chassie wasn\u2019t mad at the kid; he couldn\u2019t help being a bully, a bigot and a homophobe since he was being raised by one.</p><p>The counselor faced Robbie\u2019s parents. \u201cSince the start of the school year we\u2019ve also enacted a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, so your son will also be suspended for two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? My son is punished for stating a truth? Look at them! That\u2019s unnatural. It\u2019s obvious they\u2019re f\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will caution you, Mrs. Feckling, to refrain from repeating the offensive language that your son used,\u201d the counselor warned. \u201cI will also remind you that just because previous complaints about your son bullying other children have been officially withdrawn, the unofficial incidents are on your son\u2019s permanent record. If he keeps it up he might end up suspended for the entire year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that little\u201d\u2014she pointed at Westin\u2014\u201cfreak gets preferential treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall my son a name again and I\u2019ll show you exactly where he learned to punch,\u201d Chassie said flatly.</p><p>Edgard and Trevor each put a hand on her thigh under the table. Thoughtful and supportive, but it wouldn\u2019t hold her back from kicking ass if need be.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Glanzer, I know emotions are high right now, but threatening violence isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201d She gave Mrs. Feckling a stern look. \u201cIf I hear you refer to Westin by anything besides his given name, I will recommend a social services agency visit your home to ascertain whether your son is being verbally abused at home and lashing out with the same type of behavior at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you! Our lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharon,\u201d Mr. Feckling snapped. \u201cShut your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a dirty look.</p><p>\u201cAs it sits, both Westin and Robbie will receive a two-day suspension starting tomorrow. They can return to school on Monday, but they must meet with me and the principal before attending class. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re finished.\u201d The counselor stood.</p><p>So did the Feckling family. \u201cSince we\u2019re officially done, just let me say that no one wants this kid or any of your other kids at this school. We\u2019re a Christian community and your amoral behavior disgusts us. You think my son speaking his mind is bad? You should hear what some of the other parents are saying about you three. I don\u2019t see it changing anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with attitudes like yours. What about your Christian tenets of judge not lest ye be judged?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have a right to judge because it protects our children from people like you who fly in the face of traditional family values.\u201d She offered a smug smile. \u201cAnd there\u2019s only so much the school district can do to protect your child from this type of thing becoming a daily occurrence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise.\u201d The Fecklings swept out of the room.</p><p>Westin turned his head and looked at her. \u201cMama? Why does she hate us so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s so full of hate that she doesn\u2019t understand love.\u201d She kissed his forehead. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>The counselor looked frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t understand people like her, but there are a dozen exactly like her that have kids at this school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling us that Westin might always have a rough go of it here?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I hate it. I\u2019m trying to change things, but change is slow. And I feel it\u2019s better to be upfront with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Trevor said. \u201cWe appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>But Chassie was thinking, don\u2019t be surprised if we aren\u2019t here for school come Monday morning.</p><p>After they returned home, Chassie and Sophia went to deal with the goats. Edgard took Westin along to check cattle. Max had thrown a screaming fit in the car until he\u2019d crashed from exhaustion. So Trevor was in the house while Max napped, working on BLM land lease renewals.</p><p>He\u2019d gone to the kitchen for a cup of coffee when he saw Ramona West pull up.</p><p>She immediately bounded up the steps. She smiled at him through the glass door, but her smile dried seeing the tight set to Trevor\u2019s face. He let her in. \u201cThis is a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Chassie call you?</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow and I came to say goodbye. Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>Trevor was the type who wanted to keep family business in the family.</p><p>Ramona has been your family since you married Chassie.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Have a seat. Want coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m good. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Trevor sat across from her. \u201cWhen you watched the kids last weekend did Westin mention anything that\u2019d been happening at school?\u201d</p><p>Ramona nodded. \u201cNothing specific. Just that some kid was talking smack about his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ask for your advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think he wanted to. He\u2019s a deliberate thinker, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. But today, he took action and punched the kid who\u2019s been bullying him. He got suspended from school. The other kid\u2019s mother said a whole bunch of nasty shit to us about our perverted lifestyle. Not only was Westin in the room, so were Sophia and Max.\u201d</p><p>She reached for his arm and squeezed. \u201cOh Trevor. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now Chass has it in her head to pull Westin out and homeschool him. Part of me doesn\u2019t disagree with that. But there\u2019s a part of me thinks it\u2019ll be worse for him\u2014for all the kids in the long run if we do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re beating yourself up because Westin didn\u2019t choose the unconventional lifestyle you live\u2014and he\u2019s getting the backlash for it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor nodded, not at all shocked she\u2019d hit his worry right on the head. \u201cSo maybe it is best to keep them all here until they\u2019ve developed the skills to deal with them type of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to say fight it because I don\u2019t have the same life experiences you three have in living the way you do. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d handle looking into Westin\u2019s sweet face every day and telling him to suck it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I think about dropping him off at the bus stop and leaving him to face that shit alone? At age six? I almost break out in hives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about changing schools? Hulett or Sundance? It\u2019d be extra driving, but if Westin was in a happier learning environment, it\u2019d be worth it.\u201d</p><p>Trevor had suggested it, but Chassie refused to consider it. He\u2019d been frustrated to the point that he\u2019d reminded her that her years going to school in Moorcroft had been shitty too.</p><p>\u201cTrevor, have you guys talked about this to anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. We\u2019re sort of in that state of denial or whatever.\u201d And again, he didn\u2019t want anyone in their personal business.</p><p>But Ramona did not feel the same. She dialed a number on her cell phone and waited for the person on the other end to pick up. \u201cColby? It\u2019s Ramona. I\u2019m good.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI did behave while I was here. One night out with Keely. One. That\u2019s it, I swear! No, Cam did not have to break up a bar fight\u2014Keely and I handled it. Anyway, I stopped by to chat with Chassie before I leave and I heard something really distressing. Westin was suspended from school for standing up to a bully.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Ramona.\u201d</p><p>She shushed him. \u201cThe Glanzer clan is having a hard time with this. Do you have time to swing by and offer your old friends and your cousin some support? Because they sure could use it. Uh-huh. No problem. Bye.\u201d She hung up and said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be here in half an hour. And he\u2019s calling Colt.\u201d</p><p>Trevor wanted to ask what Colby and Colt could do, but the truth was, outside advice might help them. \u201cThanks for meddling, Ramona.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Keely went out and whooped it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one night. Jack frowns on her getting too wild.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cSo that\u2019s exactly what she did, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I swear those two fight just so they can make up.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand love. Which is why I\u2019m still single, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I\u2019ve got you here, you wanna come clean about why you just \u2018happened\u2019 to be in Wyoming the weekend we need you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t buy that coincidence, huh?\u201d</p><p>Trevor shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t about to look a gift horse in the mouth either. So what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat whole I don\u2019t understand love thing I was complaining about? It\u2019s because I swear I have the worst taste in men.\u201d Ramona twirled a section of her hair. \u201cThe last guy I dated seemed normal, right? He\u2019s rich, he\u2019s good-looking, he took an interest in me and my life on a level I\u2019ve never had. Which should\u2019ve been a warning sign. Anyway, I broke it off. He wasn\u2019t ready for that. He refused to accept it, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ramona, is he stalking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cOkay, yeah, he\u2019s stalking me. Everyone thinks I\u2019m being stupid, that I just don\u2019t understand how a real love relationship works, because I\u2019m more the one- or two-night stand kinda chick. But this? This is creepy as hell.</p> <p>\u201cHe follows me everywhere and he doesn\u2019t bother with stealth. He sends me gifts\u2014ridiculously expensive gifts.\u201d Ramona shot him a look. \u201cEvery girl\u2019s dream, right? Wrong. I have no way of returning them to the store or the courier service that delivered them. And that\u2019s exactly what he wants; me to come to him. That\u2019ll add to his delusion I can\u2019t keep away from him because we\u2019re soul mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths. We dated for about three months before I broke it off. He\u2019s spent the last six months doing this shit. I went to market in China for two weeks and when I came home? He\u2019d had my bedroom redecorated to match his.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s so...smooth and charming he convinced the building manager to give him access to my apartment so he could surprise me.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI put all the bedding in the trash\u2014I made sure he knew I did it. Then I called the Salvation Army to haul away the furniture. That\u2019s when I leapt at the chance to come here. I\u2019ve been traveling on business the last month and I\u2019m actually a little afraid to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRamona. Sweetheart. You have to call the cops.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAnd tell them what? This man who looks perfect on paper is a psychopath? He\u2019s a respected businessman, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to your folks? Or your brothers? Or your cousins about this?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cYes, I told Keely and she tattled to Cam. He freaked out. My God he is one scary-ass dude when he\u2019s upset. I shudder to think what he\u2019ll be like when Liesl starts dating. Anyway, he\u2019s got an old Army buddy who lives in Seattle and he\u2019s picking me up at the airport tomorrow. Part of me is pissed because I don\u2019t want a damn babysitter. But another part of me is really relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m relieved too. Keep in touch with us, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Now tell me about this addition Chet and Remy are putting on.\u201d</p><p>When Edgard and Westin returned home, three vehicles, belonging to Colby, Colt and Ramona were parked in the drive.</p><p>\u201cPapai, why are there people here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. Let\u2019s go find out.\u201d</p><p>Westin hesitated to get out of the truck.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d He\u2019d been his same helpful self during the cattle check, hopping out to open gates. He\u2019d been quiet, but that was to be expected, given the day he\u2019d had. So far they hadn\u2019t addressed the \u201chitting is always wrong\u201d issue\u2014mostly because they weren\u2019t sure it was wrong in this case. It\u2019d forced everyone to deal with the issue\u2014not just poor Westin alone.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should do pages in my workbook tonight since I\u2019m kicked out of school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid you\u2019ll fall behind?\u201d he teased. \u201cOf course you should do it. I\u2019ll check it. That means I\u2019ll expect the answers in English and Portuguese.\u201d</p><p>Westin grinned and rattled off \u201cI\u2019ll show you\u201d in Portuguese before he jumped out.</p><p>Inside the house Colby and Colt sat at the dining room table with Trevor.</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019ve been waiting on you,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Ramona are havin\u2019 a tea party with Max and Sophia. Westin is supposed to go up and Chassie will come down so we can chat a bit.\u201d</p><p>Westin groaned. \u201cA tea party? Dad, do I have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Aunt Ramona mentioned playing Legos afterward.\u201d</p><p>He tore off.</p><p>Colt chuckled. \u201cThe L word works every time, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Trevor kicked out the chair next to him. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Edgard noticed no one was drinking beer. Much as he could use one, he\u2019d wait. Colt had been sober for years, but he respected the man too much to make him uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWord of warning? Don\u2019t ask what the powwow is about\u2014that\u2019ll get Chass\u2019s back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Trev, did you really say that to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce. She told me if I ever said it again she\u2019d whap me upside the head with a cast iron skillet and then fill my ass with buckshot.\u201d</p><p>Colt and Colby laughed.</p><p>Chassie sauntered in. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019, sweetheart, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>She sat next to Trevor and blurted, \u201cSo Ramona called you?\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad she did \u2019cause I know you wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d His gaze encompassed all of them. \u201cNone of you would have. And that\u2019s bullshit. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to want to fight your own battles,\u201d Colt said, \u201cbut I also know when you need to ask for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you help us?\u201d</p><p>Edgard reached for Chassie\u2019s hand. \u201cThey\u2019re helpin\u2019 us just by bein\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed.</p><p>\u201cSo Sassy Chassie,\u201d Colt started and grinned, \u201cwhy in the hell would you send your kid to school in Moorcroft anyway? Because that\u2019s where you went? As I recall, your school years were awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought my experience might\u2019ve just been me. My issue bein\u2019 ethnic and poor. And Westin had a wonderful kindergarten teacher. The parents in his class seemed to like us and accept us.\u201d Her nose wrinkled. \u201cWell, most of them.\u201d</p><p>Edgard looked at Colt. \u201cYou\u2019re in the Moorcroft school district too. Doesn\u2019t Hudson start kindergarten next year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s goin\u2019 to school in Sundance. That\u2019s always been the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Trevor asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo reasons. The bus picks the kids up so damn early. There\u2019s no reason for them to have to wait an hour to get to school and an hour to get home.\u201d</p><p>Chassie gave Edgard a sheepish smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what Ed said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man. The other reason is all Hudson\u2019s cousins go to school in Sundance. There\u2019s no mornin\u2019 bus service, but Indy or I have to go to town anyway. And I know the kids; they watch out for each other.\u201d Colt leaned over and poked Chassie\u2019s arm. \u201cJust like they would if Westin went to school with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you got here, Ramona was telling me how much she hated that you, she and Keely all went to different schools,\u201d Trevor said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere did Ramona go?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cHulett.\u201d</p><p>Colby leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be blunt here, guys, okay? The worst thing you could do to Westin is pull him out of public school and homeschool him. Kids need friends and activities outside their siblings, parents and home environment. If you keep him sheltered, you\u2019ve got no chance to prove to the people who think your situation is fucked up, that there\u2019s nothin\u2019 wrong with it.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard had forgotten how intuitive Colby was. The man defined pragmatic and loyal. The three of them had shared good times during the years they traveled the rodeo circuit together. Edgard knew Trevor missed that close friendship.</p><p>But the fact he was here showed he cared. Edgard would talk with Cassie and Trevor about inviting Colby and Channing and their brood over. Maybe they had isolated themselves more than they\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cWhen you put it that way...I definitely don\u2019t think we should homeschool. My ranting was a knee-jerk reaction.\u201d Chassie sighed. \u201cMaybe Westin will have homework if we send him to school in Sundance. He complains now he doesn\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned. \u201cGib was the same way. Braxton...we practically have to hogtie that kid to the chair to get him to finish his schoolwork.\u201d</p><p>Trevor pointed at Colby. \u201cHe gets that from you, pard. We were both the same way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue. I\u2019m lucky my former schoolteacher wife cracks the whip on the boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did any of this convince you to send Westin to school in Sundance?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other. Trevor spoke. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it tonight and make our decision. I\u2019m pretty sure Westin will be on board with it. We appreciate you both comin\u2019 and setting us straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what family does, dumbass.\u201d</p><p>Everyone pushed back from the table.</p><p>\u201cIf you do decide to transfer him, give me a heads up. Me\u2019n Chan will meet you at the school early on Monday.\u201d</p> <p>Edgard clapped Colby on the back. \u201cWill do. You and your lovely wife and kids oughta come over for supper sometime in the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Colby gave him a big smile. \u201cThat\u2019d be great. I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is Channing due again?\u201d Chassie asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a ways to go since she\u2019s only three months along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix kids. Man, how\u2019re you gonna do that?\u201d Edgard asked.</p><p>\u201cNo clue. But hell, it\u2019s that third kid that\u2019s the killer. After that?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNo big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t testing that theory,\u201d Colt said. \u201cThree is enough because Ellison gets into enough trouble for two kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidja ever find out why he smeared McKenna with peanut butter?\u201d Trevor asked.</p> <p>Colt sighed. \u201cHe wanted to see if the dog would lick it off her. McKenna was so happy to have Ellison\u2019s attention she just sat there and let him do it.\u201d</p><p>Chassie snickered. \u201cI know it\u2019s not funny...the kid looks like an angel but he has such a devilish streak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna hafta keep an eye on Max and Ellison when they start school.\u201d</p><p>Ramona came downstairs with the kids.</p><p>After goodbyes were exchanged, Edgard glanced at the clock. The kids would be asking about supper soon and neither he nor Chassie had made anything.</p><p>\u201cListen up. Get your shoes on and grab your coats. We\u2019re goin\u2019 out for pizza.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t have to tell them twice. Pizza out usually meant a special occasion. Westin, Sophia and Max scattered.</p><p>\u201cPizza, huh? What\u2019re we celebrating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re celebrating us.\u201d Edgard dropped a kiss on Chassie\u2019s mouth. \u201cI like bein\u2019 home with you guys, but some of what Colby said rang true. We do isolate ourselves out here. One way for people to see us as a normal family, is to do normal family things. Like goin\u2019 out for pizza on a Wednesday night.\u201d</p><p>Trevor came up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist. \u201cExcellent idea, Ed. where we goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pizza Barn in Moorcroft.\u201d He waited, figuring he hadn\u2019t quite pulled off innocence.</p><p>Chassie opened her mouth, but closed it. Then her eyes took on a determined glint. \u201cBy the look on your face, Edgard Glanzer, I know you\u2019re aware that Wednesday night is family church night. so there will be lots of them churchy-type families havin\u2019 pizza afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then they\u2019ll see we\u2019re happy with our decision to lead this life, and our children are well adjusted and well loved.\u201d</p><p>Chassie hugged Edgard and then Trevor. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat and make sure the kids are ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re kicking dirt in some faces tonight?\u201d</p><p>Edgard shivered at the deep rumble of Trevor\u2019s voice flowing over his neck. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not suggesting we put on a PDA to show the world we don\u2019t care. I want people to understand they\u2019re not about to run us off. Especially since I suspect we\u2019ll be transferring Westin to school in Sundance. We\u2019re here for good.\u201d</p><p>Monday morning Westin was bouncing in his seat. From nerves, or excitement, Chassie didn\u2019t know.</p><p>She draped her arm over his shoulder. \u201cAll that jumping is bound to upset your stomach. Can you take a couple of deep breaths so you don\u2019t throw up on your first day?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Chassie kissed the top of his head. Her eyes met Trevor\u2019s in the rearview mirror. She returned his smile.</p><p>The closer they got to Sundance Elementary, the more jittery she became. Even when she knew they were doing the right thing, she worried about her son getting lost in the hallways or eating alone or dealing with more bullies.</p><p>\u201cMama. You\u2019re squeezing me too tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The semi-circle drop-off zone in front of the building wasn\u2019t jammed with vehicles yet. She craned her neck to see behind them. This traffic wasn\u2019t bad at all.</p><p>\u201cChass? Baby, do you see that?\u201d Edgard asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. Right in front.\u201d</p><p>When Chassie peered out the window, her jaw dropped.</p><p>Lined up in front of the school, were all her McKay relatives and their spouses. Cord and AJ, Colby and Channing, Colt and India, Cam and Domini, Keely and Jack, Kade and Skylar and Kane and Ginger. The other McKays, ones she wasn\u2019t related to, were there also\u2014Quinn and Libby, Ben and Ainsley, Tell and Georgia, and Dalton. Plus, her West cousins, Chet and Remy and Boone.</p><p>Approximately ten thousand McKay offspring raced around the adults.</p><p>After they exited the car, Westin slipped his hand into hers. \u201cMama? Why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m happy that you get to go to school with all your cousins.\u201d She sniffled and leaned her head against Trevor\u2019s bicep while Edgard stroked her back.</p><p>They faced the McKay throng.</p><p>Colby stepped forward. \u201cSurprised to see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised and grateful. And...\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish.</p><p>\u201cKids have enough to deal with without all the B.S. that was goin\u2019 on at the other school. That won\u2019t happen here. We can pretty much guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>Colt moved to stand next to Colby. \u201cNo one wants to take on the McKays one on one, let alone all of us. You guys know you\u2019ve always had our full support with your lifestyle, we just wanted to make sure everyone in town and everyone whose kids attend this school knew it too.\u201d</p><p>Chassie didn\u2019t bother to stop her tears. She\u2019d always felt like she\u2019d had some support in the McKay family, but nothing on this level.</p><p>Boone West crouched in front of Westin. \u201cKnow what? I transferred from the school in Moorcroft to this one when I was in third grade.\u201d</p><p>Westin\u2019s eyes lit up with the hero worship he reserved for his older, cooler cousin. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I promise you\u2019re gonna like it a whole lot better.\u201d</p><p>Chassie couldn\u2019t believe her scrawny, sometimes mouthy cousin had turned into such a thoughtful young man. And a good-looking kid to boot.</p><p>Boone pushed to his feet and hefted his backpack over his shoulder. \u201cAnyone says anything to you, you let me know, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll see you on the bus.\u201d Boone grinned and Chassie swore the girls walking by actually sighed. The boy was on the road to being a heartbreaker.</p><p>Then Boone offered his hand to Trevor and Edgard. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate it,\u201d Trevor said. Then he looked at his longtime friend Colby. \u201cAbove and beyond. You don\u2019t have any idea how much this means to all of us. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>And as the trio walked their son into school, they understood their rough road had just gotten a little easier.</p><p>ALL KNOCKED UP</p><p>A Rough Riders novella featuring Keely and Jack Donohue from All Jacked Up and Slow Ride.</p><p>Author\u2019s note: This story begins two months after the end of Rough Riders book 14\u2014Gone Country...</p><p>All Knocked Up: Chapter One</p><p>Keely\u2014seven months pregnant...</p><p>Keely West McKay Donohue had this pregnancy thing down pat.</p><p>Well, except for the occasional glitches when her heightened emotional state hit overload and she had a teeny, tiny, barely noticeable...episode or two.</p><p>Most of those incidents hadn\u2019t really been her fault.</p><p>Like when the grocery store had run out of her brand of laundry soap again and she\u2019d attempted to express her displeasure to the manager. But he\u2019d refused to listen to reason, calling her consumer\u2019s request a crazy woman\u2019s rant, puh-lease\u2014she hadn\u2019t even hit rant stage. Then the weasel had barricaded himself in his office, had her escorted from the premises by a pimply fifteen-year-old and banned her from the store for life. Luckily, the other grocery store in town had been much more accommodating. They\u2019d even assigned her a shopping assistant to personally escort her through the store every time she showed up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Jack could\u2019ve prevented the incident last month if he\u2019d just taken her out for finger steaks like she\u2019d asked him to. His refusal to understand the depth of her craving had forced her to cook the yummy bits of breaded and fried steak herself. So, it wasn\u2019t completely her fault that she\u2019d accidentally started a small grease fire in the kitchen and she\u2019d had to call the fire department. The fire department in turn had called the local ambulance crew, and they had contacted her brother Cam\u2014a Crook County Deputy\u2014who had called her entire family. Except no one had remembered to call her husband. So when Jack had come home after work to see the driveway filled with emergency vehicles and McKays, he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>She\u2019d had to spray him down with the hose to cool him off. Then she\u2019d really caught hell for ruining his bajillion-dollar, triple-worsted wool suit crafted out of special sheep butt hairs or some such. And people claimed she was on edge during this pregnancy?</p><p>Besides, Jack had it easy. His job as her baby daddy entailed three things:</p> <p>Sucking it up and listening to her every pregnancy complaint like she was reciting secret stock tips.</p><p>Keeping her fed and never ever ever mentioning the amount of food she consumed on a daily basis.</p><p>Fulfilling her sexual needs whenever and wherever she wanted; or keeping his dick far away from her on those bad pregnancy days she suspected she\u2019d chop it off if he showed it to her. Happily those days were mostly behind them now.</p><p>Not such a hard list. So why was he dragging his loafers on getting on with checking off task number three today?</p><p>Keely had even given him a choice on where he could perform his husbandly duties. While she waited for him to choose, she studied her hot hunk of manflesh. The man defined sexy\u2014who could blame her for wanting to jump his bones all the damn time? His dark hair was disheveled from constantly running his fingers through it. His silk paisley tie remained neatly knotted and he hadn\u2019t taken off his suit jacket, which in her mind meant he hadn\u2019t really started to work yet. So this was the perfect time for a break. Besides, Jack never really meant no.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it worth your while,\u201d she said, adding a purring rowr.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d Jack said, without looking away from his computer screen. \u201cAnd stop staring at my crotch to see if I\u2019m getting hard,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me if your boxers are getting tight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause A, I\u2019m thinking about work not sex, and if you want to see me before midnight, which isn\u2019t likely, you\u2019ll find a way to entertain yourself and let me finish this. B, if I do take your offer to bend you over the conference table and fuck you until you scream, guaranteed one of your ten billion family members will decide to pop in and interrupt us. Again.\u201d</p><p>Keely crossed her arms over her chest trying not to feel self-conscious. She could almost rest them on her protruding belly. \u201cThat was not my fault. I cannot control my family, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that only too well,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you have a client scheduled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to cancel.\u201d That\u2019s when she knew she should\u2019ve lied. He\u2019d see her offer as a way to kill time. When in actuality, she saw it as a chance to revisit their spontaneous pre-pregnancy trysts for the first time in what seemed like weeks.</p><p>Jack stopped typing and looked at her sharply. \u201cJust because you\u2019re bored doesn\u2019t mean I am.\u201d</p><p>Bored? Fuck that and fuck you too, buddy. Or better yet, I wouldn\u2019t fuck you right now if you begged me. In fact...Then just like that surly girl disappeared and weepy woman took her place.</p><p>Awesome. She hadn\u2019t run this hot and cold even as a teenager. She hated that a curt word or a scowl from him set her off into a fit of rage or a river of tears. Yet she was sick of him and everyone else muttering about her out-of-whack hormones.</p> <p>So she opted to take the high road for a change. \u201cSorry to interrupt you.\u201d Keely pushed off the doorframe and pulled the door shut behind her. Not slamming it. Point for her.</p><p>But Jack didn\u2019t chase her down.</p><p>That thought caused a pang of sadness. But it also steeled her determination to do something besides wait around for him.</p><p>Keely grabbed her things from her office. Although it was only three-thirty, she shut off the lights and locked the building.</p><p>Once she was in her Escalade tooling down the road, she realized she didn\u2019t want to go home. As social as her life was living amongst her assorted McKay and West relatives, she didn\u2019t want to hang out with any of them.</p><p>The baby performed a kick/karate chop maneuver and she rubbed a hand over her belly. \u201cGuess you\u2019re fine with it bein\u2019 you and me, huh baby D? What should we do? Daddy forbids horseback riding. No more putzing around on the ATV either.\u201d</p><p>She could go to Ziggy\u2019s\u2014see who was celebrating an early happy hour. Throw some darts. Play some pool. But then again...her body weight balance had shifted so much in the last few months that she sucked at darts. Her oversized belly made it impossible to lean over a pool table to make a decent shot.</p><p>On impulse she drove to Spearfish.</p><p>She wandered around Walmart. Annoyed with herself for being lonely but not wanting any company. Wanting this baby out so badly, but scared to death for it to actually come out. Then the baby did a full belly roll inside her that took her breath away, forcing her to rest on a porch swing in the lawn and garden department.</p><p>As she rocked, her thoughts wandered to Jack. First time he\u2019d been snappish with her for a while. He\u2019d been solicitous lately\u2014to the point she suspected the man was walking on egg shells around her.</p><p>Can you blame him after your meltdown two weeks ago?</p><p>That wasn\u2019t her fault. The stupid mixer had gotten stuck and sprayed red velvet cake batter everywhere. What woman wouldn\u2019t have thrown it off the deck and beat it to smithereens with a sledge hammer?</p><p>But Jack didn\u2019t think her behavior was normal. He\u2019d locked up all the power tools in the shed and refused to give her a key to the new paddle lock.</p><p>So maybe she\u2019d had a few crazy moments. But instead of fighting back, Jack had become gentle with her. Not that she wanted him to be a dick, but he hadn\u2019t been acting like the Jack she knew and loved.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Startled out of her brooding, Keely glanced up at the young Walmart employee. \u201cI just felt a little dizzy and needed to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His gaze slid to the cart parked alongside the garden hose display. A cart filled with bags of candy and potato chips. Three liters of strawberry soda. A tube of KY. And two containers of Brussels sprouts. \u201cIs that your cart? Because I can take it up to the checkout for you.\u201d</p><p>She looked him in the eye and lied. \u201cI have no idea whose cart that is. It was there when I sat down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019ll just move it out of your way then.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. So much for sneaking junk food into the house. But her Gestapo husband would\u2019ve confiscated it anyway and lectured her on bad eating habits. He found no humor in her pointing out that her cravings weren\u2019t clich\u00e9d like pickles and ice cream.</p><p>So it was the first time she\u2019d ever left Walmart empty-handed.</p><p>Hungry\u2014again\u2014Keely stopped into a sports bar for a burger and ordered a salad, rather than a mountain of French fries. With her feet up on the bench seat, she watched the news and Wheel of Fortune. When she glanced at the clock, she realized she\u2019d managed to kill three hours since she\u2019d left the office.</p><p>But she still didn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>She checked the newspaper for movie show times. Two movies she\u2019d never convince Jack to see were playing. Perfect way to entertain herself.</p><p>In the nearly empty theater she chose a seat where she could put her feet up. By the time the movie ended, her restlessness had abated and even baby D had settled down. So she opted to make it a double feature. For the second movie she armed herself with a jumbo bucket of popcorn slathered with butter, an extra-large box of Sugar Babies and a caffeine-free soda.</p><p>Mood lighter after the sappy love story and an action flick where the hero had blown up a shit ton of stuff, she sang along with the country tunes on the radio. So she didn\u2019t hear the siren behind her, but she sure noticed the flashing lights in her rearview mirror.</p><p>So much for her good mood.</p><p>Keely watched as her brother Cam got out of the deputy\u2019s car. By the time he reached her she\u2019d rolled the window down. She felt her own panic rise when she saw the panic on his face. \u201cCam. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Keely. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Jack\u2019s been going out of his goddamned mind the last four hours trying to track you down.\u201d He stuck his head in the window. \u201cWhere\u2019s your cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I must\u2019ve left the house without it. Or left it at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a pregnant woman. You need to have that phone on you at all times, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Enough. She was too damn old for another ass-chewing session, especially when she had to pee again. \u201cIs that some kind of Crook County law I wasn\u2019t aware of, Deputy? Are you gonna write me a fucking ticket for not having my cell phone on my person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a smart ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a pain in my ass,\u201d she shot back. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need a goddamn lecture from you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do, when your husband has called the entire family to find out where the hell you are! He\u2019s worried sick, Keely. Are you really blaming him when you\u2019ve been out of contact for hours?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cAre you kiddin\u2019 me? I went to the movies after my husband told me to leave him alone so he could work! And then he has the balls to act all concerned, like it\u2019s my fault? Bullshit.\u201d She glared at Cam. \u201cNot only did the bastard call my family to tattle on me, he called you and put out a BOLO on me too? Un-fucking-believable. He\u2019s really gonna wish he hadn\u2019t done that when I use a croquet mallet on his goddamned laptop and cell phone.\u201d Just thinking about beating the fuck out of his precious electronics made her almost giddy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cam retreated from the car window. \u201cKeely. Hon. Just chill out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe look on your face...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs what?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He blurted, \u201cReally freakin\u2019 close to evil,\u201d and took two steps back from the door so she couldn\u2019t take a swing at him. \u201cRemember. This has all been a misunderstanding. You\u2019re safe. That\u2019s all that matters. Why don\u2019t I call Jack and tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be better off calling a fucking ambulance because I\u2019m gonna kick his ass when I get home.\u201d</p><p>Keely rolled up the window and sped off.</p><p>If her brother wanted to give her a speeding ticket, fine. But he could damn well do it in her driveway.</p> <p>Jack paced on the front porch.</p><p>When he saw the lights of Keely\u2019s car, he could finally breathe. He\u2019d nearly gone bald the last four hours, pulling out his hair, desperately trying not to think of worst-case scenarios.</p><p>Cam had warned him Keely was mad\u2014really mad, boiling mad, mad like he\u2019d never seen her. But Jack wasn\u2019t worried. Her pregnancy mood swings were so erratic she might be whistling a happy tune after she\u2019d had time to think on the drive home about her inconsiderate behavior. She might even throw herself into his arms with a tearful apology.</p><p>He plastered on a smile, prepared to be magnanimous.</p><p>But the door to the Escalade was thrown open so hard the metal supports should\u2019ve bent backward. Her boots hit the pavement before he could offer to help her out. Then she slammed the driver\u2019s door with enough force the entire car shook.</p><p>But it was nothing compared to how hard Keely shook.</p> <p>Shit. \u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fucking word, Jack-ass. I\u2019m so pissed off at you right now you\u2019d better be glad I actually came home.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her and she growled. His wife actually fucking growled at him.</p><p>This was not good.</p><p>\u201cLast warning to back off. I\u2019ve had to pee since I left Spearfish and getting pulled over by my brother has just made it worse...and that\u2019s your fault too.\u201d She stomped up the stairs.</p><p>Undeterred, he followed her. \u201cDo you have any idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>Keely whipped around so fast he didn\u2019t have time to duck the blow from her purse. A purse she was now swinging around like a mace. He was so shocked at the vicious expression on her face that he didn\u2019t manage to dodge the second or third blow.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Keely. Will you knock it off?\u201d</p> <p>The next time she swung, he grabbed the strap and tugged the pink zebra cowhide bludgeoning tool from her fingers.</p><p>\u201cFine, have it,\u201d she yelled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t doin\u2019 enough damage to you to suit me anyway.\u201d She stepped back and braced her hand against the house.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Keely. Can we please talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Count to ten. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d She jammed her heel into the bootjack and removed her right boot.</p><p>\u201cCan you please try and be reasonable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonable?\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou wanna talk about bein\u2019 reasonable? You\u2019re the one who told me to buzz off and leave you alone to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took that out of context.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Keely removed her other boot. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t be home until midnight and I should find something to do to entertain myself.\u201d</p><p>Had he really said that?</p><p>\u201cSo are you all fired up because I wasn\u2019t standing on the porch holding your pipe and slippers to welcome you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019d ever happen.\u201d</p><p>Keely growled at him again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did mention I might be working late. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I couldn\u2019t get ahold of you when my workday ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when am I at your beck and call, Jack Donohue?\u201d</p><p>Where the hell had that come from?\u201cYou have to admit it\u2019s pretty irresponsible for you\u2014a pregnant woman in a rural area\u2014to forget your phone. What if you\u2019d had car trouble?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThen my brother, who was scouring the county for me, could\u2019ve given me a ride home since you called the fucking sheriff\u2019s office like I was a runaway wife. I absolutely cannot believe you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down?\u201d She reached for her boot. \u201cThe fuck I will!\u201d</p><p>The first one missed him, but the second boot hit him square in the shin. \u201cGoddammit, that\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it\u2019s not! You have no idea how furious I am right now.\u201d Keely picked up a potted plant and started toward him. \u201cYou humiliated me in front of my whole family, Jack. And no doubt you\u2019ll blame this, like you blame everything else, on my out-of-control pregnancy hormones!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, buttercup, this psycho redneck behavior is one hundred percent you, and has nothing to do with the baby\u2014\u201d was all he got out before she hurled the flower pot at his head. \u201cI cannot fucking believe you just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better not come into the kitchen because knives are a lot harder to duck, asswipe.\u201d Keely stormed into the house. She slammed the door and he heard the snick of the lock as she locked him out.</p><p>Locked out. Of his own goddamned house.</p><p>Jack yelled, \u201cReal mature, Keely.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, real mature yelling at your pregnant wife.</p><p>He slumped into the closest chair.</p><p>How had this escalated to this point?</p><p>You overreacted.</p><p>Okay, maybe the call to Cam had been unnecessary. But Keely didn\u2019t really believe that he\u2019d called her family to find out where she was as some attempt at humiliation? He\u2019d never do that to her. Jack knew how hard she\u2019d struggled not to be seen as the baby who needed constant supervision and protection. But he\u2019d been frantic because it was so unlike her to be incommunicado for that long. Wanting to know where she was wasn\u2019t a control thing. He missed her, and yeah, he\u2019d felt guilty for snapping at her and blowing her off. He\u2019d initially called her to tell her he\u2019d finished work early because he wanted to spend time with her. But it\u2019d turned into full-blown panic at hour three.</p><p>All he could do now was give her time to calm down. After being married for almost four years he ought to know a way to fix this.</p><p>Grovel.</p><p>Like hell. He ought to spank her.</p><p>Jack swept up the dirt and broken pot. He dug in her purse for her house keys and ended up finding her cell phone\u2014her completely dead cell phone.</p><p>At least she\u2019d had the phone with her.</p><p>Like that would matter now.</p><p>After he\u2019d let himself inside, he wandered into the kitchen. He washed his hands and face, and eyed the butcher block for missing knives.</p><p>Then he wandered through the rest of the main level. Keely wasn\u2019t in the bathroom, den, living room, dining room or out on the back deck. He scaled the stairs to the second floor. Not in the nursery. Or the other three bedrooms.</p><p>The door at the end of the hallway, which led to their bedroom suite, was shut.</p><p>Probably locked.</p><p>Too bad. He\u2019d kick the damn door in if he had to.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t locked.</p><p>Jack stepped inside the moonlit room and froze when he saw Keely standing by the big bay window.</p><p>She wore a nearly see-through white cotton nightgown that made her look like a goddess in the moon\u2019s silvery glow. The way her dark hair trailed down her back, the swell of her abdomen and the heavier weight of her breasts only added fuel to the fire of lust burning inside him.</p><p>That\u2019s when he knew what she needed\u2014what they both needed.</p><p>He moved in front of her and trapped her gorgeous face in his hands, tilting her head to meet his gaze. Then his mouth crashed down on hers and he kissed her with every ounce of passion and hunger she aroused in him just by existing.</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t deny his kiss or fight him, except to grab his shirt to pull him closer. They kissed crazily; mouths avid, bodies straining.</p><p>Jack herded her toward the bed. He broke the kiss, sliding his mouth to her ear. \u201cKeely. I love you. So goddamned much. And I need you. Now. Like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God, please.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the nightgown over her head. He filled his hands with her breasts and teased her neck with open-mouthed kisses and tiny sucking bites.</p><p>She arched into him and moaned.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d he ordered and inserted himself between her thighs. His hands followed the contour of her belly, amazed at how her body grew and changed every day. \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cEvery inch of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth again.</p><p>But sneaky Keely wrested control, her sensual kisses destroying him while she unbuttoned his shirt. Her hands raced over his torso, her fingers digging into his flesh. Then her mouth was on his chest, her tongue flicking his nipples between soft, suctioning kisses.</p><p>His blood pounded so hard even his skin throbbed. Her every lick and nibble made him hiss.</p><p>Jack grabbed a handful of her hair and tugged her head back. \u201cBehave. My way. Or no way. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the outer swell of her stomach and started a trail of kisses from her sternum, straight down her belly. Rubbing his razor-stubbled cheek across the roundness until she squirmed. \u201cYou are so fucking sexy when you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Before she responded, he smooched her belly button and kissed his way down the lower curve of her abdomen, dropping to his knees. He spread her knees wide and jammed his tongue deep into her cunt, filling his mouth, his senses with her essence.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>He lapped at the sweet stickiness, swirling his tongue through her soft tissues. Giving her no respite as he drove her higher and harder with each suck and flicker of his tongue. \u201cCome for me fast, cowgirl. So I can fuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen leave your mouth right there,\u201d she panted.</p><p>Jack tongued her clit relentlessly. When her thighs went rigid, he fastened his mouth to the swollen nub and sucked with enough force his teeth pressed into her quivering flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. Yes!\u201d</p><p>He automatically looked up to watch her as she unraveled, but he couldn\u2019t see over the baby bump. No matter. He could feel the strength of her orgasm pulsing against his lips. Those low-pitched groans of pleasure did it for him every fucking time, and his cock jerked against his fly in anticipation.</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t slump back on the bed and sigh when the last pulse faded. She curled her hands around his face. \u201cYou rock at that, GQ.\u201d</p> <p>He dragged an openmouthed kiss from one side of her belly to the other. Keeping his heated gaze on hers, he said, \u201cStand up.\u201d</p><p>Soon as they were both upright Jack claimed her mouth again, twisting a handful of her silky hair around his palm. He maneuvered her against the wall. He let his lips drift on the underside of her jaw, stopping at her ear. \u201cI want to fuck you hard. You all right with that?\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m always all right with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around and brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>Keely nipped his jaw hard enough he felt a bite of pain before her saucy, sassy tongue snaked out and soothed the sting. Then she spun around and waggled her ass at him.</p> <p>Oh, she\u2019d pay for that taunt.</p><p>Jack ditched his pants and boxers. Then he swatted her right butt cheek hard, keeping his hand between her shoulder blades when she emitted an indignant yelp. \u201cThat one is for whipping your boots at me.\u201d</p><p>Her butt cheeks clenched; she knew he wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>Jack smacked her left butt cheek. \u201cThat one is for throwing a flower pot at me.\u201d Then he slapped both butt cheeks simultaneously, down low, where her ass curved into her thighs. \u201cAnd that one is because I know how much you love me smacking your ass before I fuck you.\u201d He aligned his cock and filled her with one deep thrust.</p><p>Keely lifted her head and moaned. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p><p>Tempting to deny her and stay balls deep in her tight, wet heat. Barely moving. He could come that way, never pulling out fully. It drove her crazy because it took longer to reach the detonation point, even when the explosion was always worth the wait.</p> <p>But he wanted it hard, fast and without pause. Needing that adrenaline pumping though his body as he bottomed out in her soft cunt on every deliberate thrust.</p><p>He pulled out and rammed into her again. And again. Loving the sensation of her softness cushioning his pistoning hips as he pounded into her over and over.</p><p>\u201cGod, I missed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d His heart thundered. His pulse throbbed in his ears, his groin and his neck. It\u2019d been ages since they\u2019d gone at it this intensely; he wouldn\u2019t be setting endurance records because it felt too goddamn good to stop and savor it. \u201cKeely, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold off on my account, Jack. I already came once. Even if I don\u2019t come again, I love it this way.\u201d</p><p>His hands gripped her hips as he powered into her. His body urged faster. His brain...well, his brain wasn\u2019t really functioning beyond convincing him his basic life need at that moment was to come.</p><p>Six more rapid strokes and he was there.</p><p>\u201cSqueeze around me,\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>Keely bore down with her inner muscles.</p><p>His cock jerked, sending blasts of heat against her pussy walls as those muscles clamped down, pulling every bit of seed from his balls. Every bit of reason from his brain.</p><p>Every bit of anger and frustration with his wife was gone as well.</p><p>Nothing compared to make-up fucking after a big fucking fight. Nothing.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding his breath until black spots wavered behind his eyelids and he swayed. He reached for the wall.</p><p>\u201cJack? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed. \u201cSorry that went so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019m not complaining since I had another O at the end,\u201d she purred.</p><p>He eased out of her body and curled his hands around her shoulders to lift her away from the wall.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019m a little off-balance these days. And that\u2019s without you fucking me senseless.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands down her chest, stopping to caress her breasts before placing his hands on the outer swell of her abdomen. \u201cKeely, I love you. You are my world. I\u2019m sorry you doubted that even for a second today.\u201d</p><p>Keely leaned back into him. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that. I just miss you. I miss us. I miss us bein\u2019 together nekkid and sweaty like this. I miss spending time with you even if we\u2019re snuggled up on the couch when you\u2019re working on your laptop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019ve been distracted trying to get everything done before baby D\u2019s birthday... I miss you too, cowgirl. So please, come to bed with me,\u201d he murmured in her hair, his body still quaking from sex that always rocked his world.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to the bathroom first.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry to dampen the afterglow of hot sex.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled and kissed her temple. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Keely rolled onto the bed\u2014naked, that was a bonus\u2014Jack pulled her close. \u201cRest that baby on me for a while.\u201d He wedged his right side under her left side, his stomach bearing the weight of hers, nestling her head on his shoulder and tangling their legs together.</p><p>Keely sighed.</p><p>He lived for that contented sound. He played with her hair, and placed his other hand on her belly. \u201cBaby been active today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally active practicing martial arts moves with flying elbows and kicking feet. But naturally it\u2019s asleep now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it sleep through...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs fighting? Or us fucking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlept through both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jack pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. We haven\u2019t had a fight for a while.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her with disbelief. \u201cUh, yeah we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast month? When you took after me with a pitching wedge in the driveway? That wasn\u2019t a fight?\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted. \u201cNo. That was a warning if you left your stupid golf clubs on the front porch again, I\u2019d repurpose them as weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight come in handy to use on my brothers. Are they gonna show up tomorrow gunning for me because you called them to tattle I was MIA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jesus. Don\u2019t even joke about that. And for the record, I didn\u2019t call your whole family. I called Cam and your mom.\u201d He groaned. \u201cExcept your dad answered the phone and demanded details on what I\u2019d done to piss off his daughter now. After nearly four years of marriage I\u2019m still trying to prove I\u2019m good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a daddy\u2019s girl, what can I say?\u201d She poked him in the chest and teased, \u201cYou\u2019ll know what it\u2019s like to have a daughter in, oh, roughly two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer, cowgirl. We are only having boys.\u201d</p><p>Keely propped her chin on his shoulder and looked at him. \u201cJack, we haven\u2019t even discussed baby names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we only need one.\u201d He grinned. \u201cJack junior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Our first son will be named Jack Donohue, junior. We can call him JJ.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd I suppose a girl would be called what...Jackie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Jack kissed her nose. \u201cBecause we\u2019re only having sons, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. But no matter the first name, the middle name of every child\u2014boy or girl\u2014will be McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad will love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell him it was your idea,\u201d she cooed with total sarcasm. \u201cThat\u2019d earn you some brownie points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a suck-up. And Carson would just think I was a pussy if I acted like one.\u201d</p><p>After a while, she said, \u201cWe start childbirth classes next month.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t groan. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Keely drew circles on his chest. \u201cUs having a baby hasn\u2019t impacted your life much at all, has it? Besides having to deal with your moody pregnant wife.\u201d</p><p>The odd thing was, he\u2019d thought about this, but they\u2019d never discussed it. \u201cUs having a baby hasn\u2019t impacted my life yet,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cSo yes, to some extent, I can forget about it while I go about my daily business. But I never forget it\u2019s always there for you. You\u2019re the one literally carrying the load, Keely. The baby is changing your body, your moods, determining what you can and can\u2019t do. I feel like...\u201d He paused, unsure how she\u2019d take his brutal honesty.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me anything, no matter how strange it might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur baby is some vague concept. I see it moving in you. We\u2019ve readied the nursery, we\u2019ve looked at the ultrasound pics, which is just fucking bizarre because they make me afraid we\u2019re having an alien.\u201d</p><p>Keely laughed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like a human, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs being in the family way won\u2019t affect me until you go into labor and I know that baby is coming out\u2014one way or another. So I\u2019m in stasis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I feel most days too.\u201d</p><p>The skin beneath his hand rippled and he watched as an elbow or a knee moved along the surface like a shark\u2019s fin on the water until it disappeared. \u201cHoly shit. Did you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely felt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Mostly it\u2019s just weird having something living inside me.\u201d She smiled softly\u2014almost serenely and placed her hand over his on her belly. \u201cBut it is really freakin\u2019 cool, too.\u201d</p><p>Jack tucked a hank of hair behind her ear. \u201cThat it is.\u201d</p><p>She yawned. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re tired. Can you fall asleep like this?\u201d Keely\u2019s tendency to snuggle up with him at night had ended the fourth month of her pregnancy. He\u2019d missed her sprawled all over him.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But I\u2019ll probably wake you when I have to get up in a while and use the bathroom again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t mind.\u201d Jack pulled the covers over them.</p><p>\u201cAbout the flowerpot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize.

I swear she would\u2019ve invited everyone in three counties if I hadn\u2019t culled her guest list. Were you disappointed that Ramona couldn\u2019t be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m happy that she\u2019s finally got a decent man in her life. Chassie felt bad about missing it too, but both she and baby Isabel have a nasty cold and she didn\u2019t want to infect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Vi was disappointed Chase and Ava weren\u2019t here this weekend with their darling little boy Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s hell taking a baby with an ear infection on a plane\u2014even a private plane.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s mother picked up a plate with remnants of blue and pink frosting on the plastic fork and tossed it in the garbage. \u201cIt was sweet of Vi and Rielle to bake the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sucker for cake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you are, sweetie. You crashing from the sugar buzz yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I am tired. I hate bein\u2019 so freakin\u2019 tired all the time.\u201d The ladies who\u2019d attended the shower smirked and said the tired aspect wouldn\u2019t go away after the birth\u2014that was the universe\u2019s way of preparing her for sleepless nights and the demands of parenting.</p><p>A bunch of horseshit, if you asked her. Her tiredness stemmed from carrying around fifty extra pounds.</p><p>Keely\u2019s mom put an arm around her shoulders, directing her to a recliner in the den. \u201cPut your feet up. Sweetie, you sure you\u2019re okay? You look a little...off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. This is all a lot to process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I know that\u2019s not what put that wrinkle in your brow. So what\u2019s really bothering you?\u201d</p><p>Keely knew her mom would see through flippancy or badger her if she hedged, so she admitted, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf everything having to do with having a baby. I\u2019ve been hearing childbirth horror stories and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely West McKay.\u201d Her mother sat on the ottoman and set her hand on Keely\u2019s knee. \u201cYou have to stop listening to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it seemed everyone wanted to share theirs with me today. I\u2019ve heard about back labor, and all the different tears, rips and fissures that can happen to and around my va-jay-jay. Not to mention the discussions of cracked and bleeding nipples, sleep deprivation, months of postpartum depression and the death knell of my sex life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh pooh. Scare tactics. Those women only wanted to prove their expertise, for lack of a better term, in something they\u2019ve experienced. Plus, there is competition about who has the most horrifying childbirth story. I swear I heard that friend of yours from high school, Mary what\u2019s-her-name, talking about her episiotomy. There\u2019s not that much skin down there to sustain the two hundred stitches it took to sew her up.\u201d Her mom sighed. \u201cOkay, she didn\u2019t actually say two hundred stitches, but she made it sound that bad to scare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you worried when you were pregnant with Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified. I was twenty years old and my mother had died the year before so I had no one to talk to who\u2019d been through it. Then again, in those days, the details of childbirth weren\u2019t discussed. So it is good that attitude has changed and women are comfortable sharing their stories. And back then, men weren\u2019t expected to be in the delivery room.\u201d</p><p>Keely frowned. \u201cDaddy cooled his boots in the waiting room while you labored alone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey tried to keep him out, but your father\u201d\u2014she smiled\u2014\u201cdefines stubborn. He told the hospital staff he didn\u2019t abandon his heifers when they were birthing their first calves and he damn well wasn\u2019t going to abandon his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod. A cattle analogy when you were in labor? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which just proves he is a cattleman to the core,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cBut Carson was such a rock through all the deliveries. He never left my side.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut I swear, the man looked ready to faint when the doctor lifted you up and said, it\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy didn\u2019t always know what to do with me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen or now.\u201d Keely\u2019s mom squeezed her hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve been blessed with twenty-six grandchildren. Most days I can\u2019t wrap my head around that number. Your father never worried when any of his daughters-in-law were expecting. Although we were both devastated for Cord and Channing when she lost the baby. But he\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Keely blurted, \u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the same way with me, with every pregnancy. Mentioning that women still died in childbirth\u2014even in modern times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy said that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He said it to Cal and Kimi told me. So I cut the man some slack when he wanted to fuss over me when I was pregnant. And he\u2019s mentioned that same concern about you to me a time or two. Parental worry never goes away. Even when you\u2019re a grown woman with a family of your own. Your father loves all you kids. But sweetheart, you are something special in his world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa. You\u2019re gonna make me cry.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and kissed Keely\u2019s forehead. \u201cWe love you, sweetheart. And we couldn\u2019t be happier for you and Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just count yourself lucky that Jack will be involved in all aspects of raising your child. Your dad never changed a diaper. Not one.\u201d</p><p>Keely could not wrap her head around that. All of her brothers and male cousins had no issue with diaper duty. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell Daddy tough shit and suck it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe fought about it, trust me. I argued that he had no issue sticking his entire arm up a cow\u2019s rectum and being covered\u2014and I mean covered\u2014in cow shit on a daily basis, but he gagged at the thought of one poopy baby diaper.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cThat was his generation. Be thankful Jack is of another generation.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and Jack and his mother entered the dining room, deep in conversation. Keely\u2019s eyes narrowed. Correction. It appeared sweet Doro Donohue was ripping her son a new one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back just in time, daddy-to-be,\u201d Carolyn trilled. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff to be hauled upstairs to the nursery.\u201d</p><p>Jack flashed Carolyn a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure Keely will want to show me everything before I become her pack mule.\u201d He crossed the room and swept his hand over her belly as he kissed her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ankles are swollen. And I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably from a sugar buzz. How many pieces of cake did you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many pieces did you sneak in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>She swatted at him. \u201cNone of your business. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you have a dab of frosting right here.\u201d He licked the corner of her mouth. \u201cMmm. Sugary-sweet and tastes like guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, the baby likes cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my baby likes cake.\u201d He murmured, \u201cYou know, we haven\u2019t used frosting as body paint in a while.\u201d</p><p>A throat cleared behind them and they both turned.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve had people in your house all day, I\u2019m sure you two would like alone time.\u201d Keely\u2019s mom had moved to stand by Doro. \u201cWe\u2019ll get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady to go whenever you are,\u201d Doro said.</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut to celebrate with Carolyn, Kimi and Vi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Joan came to the shower she\u2019s going out with us too,\u201d Carolyn added. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve lined up designated drivers to pick us up at the Golden Boot if things get out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keely and Jack said simultaneously. Then Jack demanded, \u201cCarolyn, are you seriously taking my mother out drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, pooh. Don\u2019t look so shocked. This is a rite of passage for your mom; a woman becoming a grandmother for the first time. Who better to initiate Doro into that world than the McKays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point, Jack,\u201d Keely said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to not act my age, Jack Donohue.\u201d Doro straightened her shoulders. \u201cAnd I say don\u2019t wait up for me either.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Keely heard was Jack\u2019s mom asking if Carolyn knew any single men.</p><p>\u201cNow I need a damn drink,\u201d Jack grumbled, walking to the bar to pour himself a Scotch.</p><p>Keely followed and hoisted herself onto a bar stool. \u201cLooked like you and your mom were having an argument when you walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were.\u201d Jack uncapped the crystal decanter and poured. \u201cSeemed her sudden need for a trip to the store to buy antacids was a trick to have a private conversation with me about my business trip tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Keely glanced down at her hands.</p><p>Then Jack\u2019s fingers were beneath her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cYou told me you were okay with this trip, buttercup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Or I\u2019m not, depending on the hour.\u201d</p><p>He waited, those mesmerizing green eyes both patient and concerned.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s an important job. I know you\u2019re only going now so you won\u2019t have to go in the next three months. I know it\u2019s only a week. I know I\u2019m still three weeks from my due date.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know all that, but...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s part of me that doesn\u2019t want you to go.

My dad did that and landed himself in an early grave because of it.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cLike I needed that fucking reminder, along with all the other things that are running around in my brain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kinds of things?\u201d</p><p>He drained his drink. \u201cToo much guilt and bullshit male stuff that\u2019d make you roll your eyes and wonder if you married a man or a whiny pussy.\u201d</p><p>Keely slid off the stool and cut around the end of the bar to hug him\u2014as much as she could with beach ball baby between them. \u201cI know you\u2019re a man. All man. So since we\u2019re alone, maybe you oughta prove that to me a couple of times before you leave.\u201d</p><p>Jack smoothed her hair away from her cheek. \u201cYou really up for this, cowgirl? It\u2019s been a long day. You said your ankles are swollen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how\u2019s about if you make my pussy swollen, so I really have something interesting to bitch about at the breakfast table tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am unbelievably charming and sexy as hell.\u201d Keely kissed him and tugged his bottom lip between her teeth, just to see that spark of desire flare in his eyes. \u201cWe better do it all we can in the next three weeks, because it\u2019ll be at least six weeks after baby D\u2019s birth before we can have sex again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that ban on sex include anal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a guy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust being practical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s do it on the recliner. I\u2019ll even bring a piece of cake so you can lick frosting off my nipples.\u201d</p> <p>One week later...</p><p>Keely prided herself on providing a full twenty minutes of random conversation before grilling her cousin Dalton about his love life. \u201cSo what\u2019s this I hear about you and Addie Voorhees dating?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re spending time together. I\u2019ve known her forever. She\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she is. But isn\u2019t she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that you\u2019re surprised because she\u2019s a nice girl and totally not my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Defensive much? That wasn\u2019t what I was gonna say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. I\u2019ve just heard that a lot. From everyone in town. Including several members of our family.\u201d Dalton cocked his head and offered the dimpled grin that\u2019d been causing him problems his entire life. \u201cSo what were you gonna ask?\u201d</p><p>Now that Keely thought about it...this question would probably get his back up even more. \u201cJust that Addie and Rory Wetzler are best friends, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were inseparable during high school. But Rory\u2019s been living in Laramie for the past six years. Why?\u201d</p><p>Keely shrugged and swigged her soda.</p><p>\u201cYou oughta just spit out whatever\u2019s put that cat-stealing-cream look on your face, Keely,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cFine. I just find it...odd, that you and Addie started seeing each other a couple months after Rory went to study in South America.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy\u2019s that odd?\u201d</p><p>Because I don\u2019t think Rory would be okay with Addie dating you. Although Keely prided herself on honesty, this was one time where she\u2019d hedge. \u201cDidn\u2019t you and Rory have a thing?\u201d</p><p>He squirmed. Her big, bad, brawling baby cousin blushed beet red. \u201cWe\u2019re friends. Or we were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Because Rory caught the bouquet at our wedding and everyone said you two were all kinds of cozied up on the dance floor after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was almost four years ago,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cA lot can change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Sierra told me Rory took a swing at you in the bar last fall before Christmas. She didn\u2019t say why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cLook, it\u2019s complicated, okay? And why do you care? It\u2019s not like Rory is even around now. Addie said Rory didn\u2019t take issue with it when she told Rory that me\u2019n her were dating.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right. Pay no attention to me. I dated Jack\u2019s brother before we got married. Jessie was married to your brother Luke before she and Brandt got hitched, so I guess it\u2019s not that odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...there it is. Another McKay family member hearing wedding bells in the distance for me long before I hear them,\u201d Dalton said dryly.</p><p>Keely laughed. \u201cGuilty. Let\u2019s change the subject. So how\u2019d you get roped into Keely duty?\u201d</p><p>Dalton lifted a brow and repeated, \u201cKeely duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poker face is for shit, Dalton McKay. For the past week since Jack has been gone, everyone in the McKay family and their dog\u2014literally\u2014has stopped by to check on me. Like I\u2019ll have a nervous fucking breakdown if I have to spend time alone. I have two weeks left until my due date. If this baby takes after its father, it\u2019ll be late anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I musta missed the McKay family memo about my rotation on babysitting bratty you. I stopped by to talk to Jack. Had no idea he was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Since when was he buddy-buddy with Jack?</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo retort on the bratty you comment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was practicing bein\u2019 mature and ignoring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith that...\u201d Dalton stood. \u201cNeed me to do anything before I go?\u201d</p><p>Keely shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She heaved herself out of the chair. \u201cMy butt\u2019s asleep so I\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d</p><p>A blast of heat hit her as soon as she stepped onto the front porch. The temp had hit one hundred degrees the last three days. Being nine months pregnant was miserable. Add in the August heat and, well, she had no idea how pregnant women survived before air conditioning. \u201cShould I tell Jack you stopped by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019ll catch him some other time.\u201d</p><p>Which meant Dalton had been tasked to keep her company for a few hours. Her youngest cousin had a better poker face than she\u2019d given him credit for.</p><p>When Keely got up at three a.m. to go to the bathroom for the two hundredth time, she had heartburn so bad she decided to try and sleep upright in the recliner in the den. But the fabric made her sweat. Even the crotch of her pajamas were wet. She shifted her hips and a trickle of water further dampened her panties.</p><p>Great. Now I\u2019m peeing my pants?</p><p>The tears she\u2019d held in all day poured out. She blubbered as she changed clothes\u2014but her sweat pants wouldn\u2019t stay up. She\u2019d stretched the drawstring to the limit around her gigantic belly. So she sat on the edge of her bed, in her underwear, and cried.</p><p>Suck it up, buttercup. Won\u2019t be much longer and you\u2019ll forget all this as you\u2019re holding our baby.</p><p>Jack\u2019s voice in her head snapped her out of it.</p><p>She rubbed her belly. \u201cI\u2019m missing your daddy something fierce. I lied when I said I\u2019d be okay if he took this business trip. But he promised it\u2019s the last one until you make your appearance. Which I\u2019m hoping is soon.\u201d</p><p>When Keely stood, liquid trickled down her leg. A lot of liquid.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t peeing herself; her water had broken.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This couldn\u2019t be happening. She hadn\u2019t meant she wanted the baby out this soon! Jack wasn\u2019t here. She couldn\u2019t have the baby without him. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be here until late tomorrow night. Or wait. Was that tonight? She glanced at the clock. Four-thirty a.m.</p><p>Jack\u2019s last big meeting was in four hours.</p><p>She mostly stayed out of his business, but he might throw a shit fit if she interrupted him, so she wouldn\u2019t call him. He\u2019d call her after he closed the deal anyway.</p><p>Okay. She\u2019d just...kill time for a few hours. Watch TV. No big deal. First babies took forever. At least twenty-four to thirty hours, according to all the childbirth books she\u2019d read.</p><p>To take her mind off everything, she stripped the bedding and tossed it in the washer.</p><p>Good. That\u2019d killed ten minutes.</p><p>She ate a few bowls of chocolate-frosted flakes.</p><p>Then she stretched out in the recliner with the TV on. She dozed off only to be awakened by a god-awful tightening in her mid-section.</p><p>Holy fuck. Was that a labor pain?</p><p>Nah. She probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten half a box of cereal. And four pieces of toast. And a couple frozen waffles.</p><p>Since the sun was up, Keely ventured outside and watered the flowers on the back deck. And the ones on the front deck. By the time she finished, the cramping in her abdomen was getting worse. Motherfucking hell, that motherfucking hurt. Then more liquid gushed out.</p><p>She needed to go to the hospital now.</p><p>She walked inside, grabbed her keys, walked back out and climbed in her car.</p><p>Jack\u2019s phone buzzed at nine-thirty, right after he\u2019d finished his meeting. He looked at the caller ID and his entire body stilled. \u201cAJ? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2019s water broke.\u201d</p><p>His heart rate spiked. \u201cWhen? Why didn\u2019t she call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s the thing. Hang on.\u201d He couldn\u2019t make out any words from the muffled voices in the background. \u201cSorry about that. Look, no one knows what\u2019s goin\u2019 on with her. She drove herself to the hospital this morning without her purse, without her hospital bag, without anything except her keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She also showed up barefoot, in her pajamas. So, we, ah, think she\u2019s in some kind of shock, denial thing since you\u2019re not here. Doc Monroe did get her admitted into a private room, but she\u2019s refusing to see anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven me.\u201d</p><p>Christ. He\u2019d felt somewhat justified leaving her because she had so many family members willing to step in. Now when she needed them she was shutting them out? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did manage to talk to her for a minute before she called the nurse to have security remove me from her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the two of you decided there\u2019d be no one in the delivery room with you. Period. She says she\u2019s sticking to that and waiting for you. When I asked what time you were expected to get to the hospital, she said after your big meeting ended in Arizona. At that point I realized she hadn\u2019t even called you yet so I thought I\u2019d better.\u201d AJ blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cLook. When does your flight leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt two. I get into Denver at four...and shit, that won\u2019t work. I\u2019ll still have to drive another four hours...\u201d He paced, but his mind was not operating on all cylinders. Keely would never forgive him if he wasn\u2019t there for the birth. Never. And he wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive himself either.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d AJ said sharply.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll charter a plane,\u201d he said offhandedly. \u201cNow let me talk to my wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not kiddin\u2019 when I say she won\u2019t let anyone in the room. Just the nurse. Just Doc Monroe and she\u2019s gone to the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell her I\u2019m on the phone.\u201d</p><p>AJ groaned. \u201cCarolyn tried that. As soon as Keely found out you weren\u2019t on the phone, she threw the phone at the wall and told her mom to get out or else she\u2019d have Cam arrest her for trespassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would you guys lie to her? Why didn\u2019t Carolyn call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just the messenger. So my message is to hurry up and get home.\u201d AJ hung up.</p><p>Jack called Gavin Daniels, Keely\u2019s cousin he\u2019d done business with. \u201cGavin? Jack. Do you have any private aviation contacts in Tucson? Keely\u2019s in labor and I need to get home ASAP. Uh-huh. Rapid or Spearfish\u2014preferably Spearfish. That\u2019ll be fine. Cost is not an issue. Thanks. I owe you one. I\u2019m on my way to the airport now.\u201d</p> <p>He arrived in Spearfish five hours later. Gavin picked him up and didn\u2019t make idle chitchat on the way to the hospital, which Jack appreciated.</p><p>Jack nearly ran inside the ER doors. At the receptionist\u2019s desk, he said, \u201cKeely Donohue. She\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer husband, Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>The receptionist clicked the keys. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re cleared to go in\u2014wow, looks like you\u2019re the only one cleared to go in. Down the hallway, and take the first right. They\u2019ll clear you through from there.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t make it past the first reception area before he was surrounded by McKays, who all talked at once. He let loose an ear-piercing whistle\u2014a trick his wife had taught him.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you all being here when I couldn\u2019t be. But go home. I promise we\u2019ll call when we have news.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo home?\u201d Carolyn repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Carson snapped.</p><p>The arguing started immediately.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t have time for this. He walked to the next receptionist\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019m Jack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know who you are. Your wife had been calling from the room every fifteen minutes to ask if you\u2019re here yet. It stopped in the last hour, like she\u2019d given up on you.\u201d</p><p>His stomach knotted.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in room two. The nurse will fill you in.\u201d</p><p>Jack scrubbed his hands over his face and inhaled a deep breath before he opened the door.</p><p>Keely was lying on her side, curled into a ball with her back toward him. The fetal monitoring device positioned at the head of the bed.</p><p>He rounded the opposite side of the bed so not to startle her. Her eyes were closed and her face was pinched with pain. \u201cHey, cowgirl. How you holding up?\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t acknowledge him at all.</p><p>Was she really that sound asleep?</p><p>Jack ran his hand up her arm. \u201cKeely?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes opened. \u201cJack? Is that really you?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cYes. I got here as soon as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Being in the delivery room with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. About us havin\u2019 a baby.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cIt\u2019s a little late to worry about that now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t believe...\u201d She sat up and started to cry. Blubbering so he couldn\u2019t understand anything she said.</p><p>Then she flopped back into the mattress. Tears flowed down her face and she cried quietly. She wouldn\u2019t even look at him.</p><p>Fuck. He could handle anything but her tears. He handed her a wad of tissues but she just balled them in her fist and didn\u2019t attempt to mop up the waterworks.</p><p>Jack stood by the side of her bed, hands in his pockets, absolutely at a loss. He\u2019d never seen Keely listless and weepy. Might make him masochistic, but he wished she\u2019d take a swing at him. Or yell at him. Hell, he\u2019d even be happy if she threw the pitcher of water at his head. \u201cButtercup. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me home,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we have this baby and everyone is all right, I promise I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>Keely shook her head. \u201cCan\u2019t we just go home and we\u2019ll come back and try again tomorrow? The baby isn\u2019t supposed to be here for two more weeks. I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a few hours to get ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>She really was in shock. He\u2019d never seen that before. \u201cYou can. You have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re gonna be like this then I want you out of my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>Keely tried to turn away from him and tune him out.</p><p>Jack hated to poke the bear, but pissing her off was the fastest way to snap her out of it. He got right in her face. \u201cSo how\u2019d you end up breaking your water?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been gone for a week. What did you do during that time? Were you tearing around on the ATV or out joyriding your horse, trying to get this baby here faster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just sitting on the bed and it felt like I kept peeing my pants. Then it just gushed out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just...what? Grabbed your keys, left the house barefoot, in your pajamas, without your damn cell phone\u2014again\u2014and just drove yourself to the hospital? Why didn\u2019t you at least call your mom? Or AJ? Or one of the two thousand other McKays who always seem to be underfoot\u2014except when you need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why...\u201d More tears flooded her eyes. \u201cI just wanted you. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right you weren\u2019t. When did you intend to call me? Right, how could you have called me without your cell phone? I swear I\u2019m tethering that thing to your wrist from here on out.\u201d</p><p>A spark of defiance flashed in her eyes. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live for a challenge. Maybe I\u2019ll take your car keys away too, so you\u2019ll have to call someone when you need help because you won\u2019t be able to go anywhere by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it in a fucking heartbeat. Sometimes your independent streak drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>That got her back up.</p><p>Good. He kept hammering at her. \u201cThis is our first baby. I know you\u2019re freaked out. I am too. Childbirth has come a long way, but there are still dangers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your information, buster, women have been havin\u2019 babies all over the place since the beginning of time. I don\u2019t need you to goddamn lecture me on what it takes to have a baby since I\u2019m the one pregnant! You cannot just show up here and take over like you know what\u2019s goin\u2019 on when you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m just supposed to stand by and watch you fall to pieces? The baby is coming, whether you\u2019re ready or not, whether or not you like it. So suck it up and deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you bein\u2019 such an asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he asked innocently. \u201cI\u2019m never an asshole to you.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the day. But you have been less assholish the last few weeks. In fact, you\u2019ve been downright mushy gushy with me lately...\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cHey. That was a trick, Mr. Know-it-all, storming in here, saying all that bullshit so I\u2019d get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListening to you rant is a damn sight better than watching you cry.\u201d</p><p>Her bottom lip quivered but she firmed it. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, buttercup, you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I still wanna punch your smarmy face, jerkwad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Jack watched her settle and inhale a deep breath. He fought a grin seeing her hand was still balled into a fist. \u201cBut can we get back to the business at hand first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways business with you, GQ.\u201d She eyed his clothing. \u201cI hope you get baby birth junk and goo all over your snappy suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that was just plain mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can start crying again, if you\u2019d rather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no.\u201d He reached for her hand. \u201cAre you having contractions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re random and they hurt like a motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Doc Monroe to get back here and give me a C-section because I don\u2019t think I can do this the normal way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do this the normal way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no we. You don\u2019t have amniotic fluid gushing out of your dick nor do you have to push something that weighs six pounds through the small hole at the end of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack covered her mouth with his. Then he eased back to stare into her wild eyes. \u201cYes, we. Always we, Keely. Always.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she said in a small voice that ripped at him.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, here comes another one.\u201d</p> <p>His mind went blank momentarily at seeing her face twist into a mask of pain. Then something clicked and he remembered what he was supposed to do. \u201cCome on, breathe with me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes locked onto his as he led her through the worst of it. Then she slumped against him, burying her face in his neck. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. I can\u2019t do this without you.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed the top of her head. \u201cEvery minute it took me to get here was pure torture.\u201d</p><p>Doc Monroe came into the room. \u201cJack, glad to see you made it.\u201d She snapped on protective gloves and sat on a small rolling stool at the end of the bed. \u201cLet\u2019s see where we are.\u201d</p><p>The nurse said, \u201cKeely, you need to scoot down so the doctor can check you.\u201d</p> <p>Keely didn\u2019t snap off a snarky comment, which was unlike her, especially since she was friends with the doctor. She clutched Jack\u2019s hand as she wiggled into position.</p><p>Jack never took his eyes off Keely as Doc Monroe examined her.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve only dilated another centimeter since my last check. Since it\u2019s been fourteen hours since your water broke, and you\u2019re not progressing, we\u2019ll need to put you on Pitocin to move the labor along.\u201d She spoke to the nurse, who nodded as she jotted down the details.</p><p>Doc Monroe stood and removed the gloves. \u201cHow you holding up, Keely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter now that Jack is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much.\u201d She eyed Jack\u2014probably so see if Keely\u2019s verbal lashing had left physical marks. \u201cThought you\u2019d be in the doghouse for a lot longer, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe day isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d Keely retorted.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOkay, Daddy, here\u2019s the deal. You are gonna do whatever Keely wants, needs, asks for, to get her through the next couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, hours. Keely has a ways to go before she\u2019s ready to deliver. Pitocin will create stronger, more consistent contractions. I\u2019ll be back in a few hours to check on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I need to change into scrubs or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we\u2019re close to the finish line.\u201d The doctor spoke to the nurse and they wheeled the IV over.</p><p>After starting the IV drip, another contraction hit.</p><p>The nurse brought Jack a chair. \u201cSit. Get comfy. You\u2019ll be here a while. If you need anything, hit the call button.\u201d</p> <p>Another seven hours passed and Jack was wrung out.</p><p>Keely, his beautiful, wonderful, tough cowgirl held it together. She hadn\u2019t taken a swing at him, like her brothers had warned him she\u2019d do. She hadn\u2019t tried to twist his dick off or knee him in the family jewels, like her brothers had warned him she might try. Good thing, he\u2019d left his cup at home. She\u2019d only called him fuckface-asshat-sonuvabitching-goddamn bastard, twice\u2014pretty much a normal day for them.</p><p>The harder the contractions, the quieter she became. When the contractions seemed to come without pause, she breathed through every one, keeping a death grip on his hand. Focused on him, she connected so intimately to him he swore he felt her labor pain several times.</p><p>Jack fed her ice chips and wiped her face with cool cloths. He rubbed her back. He offered her lots of praise. He did everything he was supposed to do but none of it seemed enough as she struggled to bring their child into the world.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Keely panted.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart, what do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should say that to me all the time. Oh God-oh God-oh God\u2014that fucking hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and kept her eyes closed. \u201cGet the nurse. I need to push. I need to push now.\u201d</p><p>He hit the call button.</p><p>The nurse checked her and gave them the thumbs up. \u201cShe\u2019s at nine.\u201d She tossed him a set of scrubs. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with her while you change.\u201d</p><p>Everything in the next fifteen minutes passed in a blur.</p><p>Keely had gone into a trance-like state as she faced the final hurdle. He stayed by her side, but he wasn\u2019t sure if she knew he was there.</p><p>Medical personnel came in and out of the room.</p><p>Finally Doc Monroe returned. \u201cOkay, Keely, let\u2019s do this thing. Keep focused on your breathing. There are times I\u2019ll want you to push and times I won\u2019t. Listen to Jack. He\u2019ll help you through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, it fucking burns so bad I need to push,\u201d Keely shouted.</p><p>\u201cAll right, gimme a push.\u201d</p><p>Jack had to grit his teeth at the painful sound coming from his wife. He didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d survive this. He didn\u2019t know how he could ever ask this of her again.</p><p>\u201cHold on one second sweetie and breathe. Jack, get her a little more upright and hold on to her.\u201d</p><p>He tilted the bed and grasped her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Keely, go ahead and push again,\u201d Doc Monroe said.</p><p>Keely made a grunting cry. Once. Twice. Then she slumped against him. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust two more pushes, Keely, and your baby will be here.\u201d</p><p>He felt Keely gather herself. Then she bore down so hard her entire body shook.</p><p>\u201cHold one second. Good. All right. One more.\u201d</p><p>Keely reached for his forearm. \u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotcha. Squeeze me as hard as you need to.\u201d</p><p>She emitted a triumphant cry and nearly broke his forearm, but he didn\u2019t care because he knew she\u2019d done it.</p><p>He peered down her body but couldn\u2019t see anything.</p><p>Doc Monroe laughed. \u201cCongratulations, Donohues, you have a baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Jack was stunned. If he hadn\u2019t been holding on to Keely he might\u2019ve crashed right to the floor.</p><p>A girl?</p><p>What the hell did he know about little girls?</p><p>Then the bloody, slippery thing was laid on Keely\u2019s stomach.</p><p>They both just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cOmigod. There she is,\u201d Keely said in awe. \u201cShe\u2019s real. She\u2019s...ours.\u201d She turned her head into Jack\u2019s bicep and started to cry.</p><p>Jack pressed his cheek into the top of Keely\u2019s head, so overwhelmed he couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, do you want to cut the cord so we can get her cleaned up and checked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d But as he reached for surgical instrument, his hand shook so violently he almost dropped it.</p><p>Doc Monroe patted his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Snip.</p><p>Then the nurses whisked the baby away.</p><p>She screamed bloody murder.</p><p>Jack wanted to go see what they\u2019d done to her to make her cry like that. That wasn\u2019t natural...was it?</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can let go of my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Keely leaned back into the mattress. Jack kissed her forehead. Her temple and finally her lips. \u201cI love you. That was amazing.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely, gotta give me one more push.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cThis was the gross part in the books. The placenta.\u201d She sat up and pushed.</p><p>\u201cAll done. No episiotomy. No tears as far as I can tell,\u201d Doc Monroe said and stood. She patted Keely\u2019s knee. \u201cGood job, Mama. Lemme check on your girl\u2019s stats so you can have her.\u201d</p><p>Keely placed her hand on Jack\u2019s cheek and turned his face toward her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head to clear it. \u201cA girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo say the least. Both our families are male dominant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s about to change in our household,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>\u201cShe weighs eight pounds two ounces,\u201d Doc Monroe announced. \u201cShe\u2019s twenty-two inches long. And she...\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d She wandered over with the bundle and stopped at the foot of the bed. \u201cYou feeling up to holding her?\u201d</p><p>Keely held out her arms. \u201cGimme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you half an hour in here and then we\u2019ll move you into a regular room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have some food, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let them know.\u201d The medical personnel vanished.</p><p>\u201cJack, hand me that pillow.\u201d</p><p>Keely placed the pillow lengthwise on her lap and laid the baby across it. \u201cLet\u2019s unwrap our girl and check her out.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Keely removed the pink hat, Jack said, \u201cHoly shit. She\u2019s got red hair. A lot of red hair.\u201d He touched her tiny head. \u201cIt\u2019s so soft.\u201d</p><p>They looked at her fingers and toes. Poked at her chubby legs. Marveled at her long arms. Studied her perfectly round, perfectly beautiful little face. She\u2019d mellowed out. She let them poke and prod her without fussing at all.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I\u2019m speechless. She\u2019s...not an alien,\u201d Jack said softly. \u201cBut she might as well be. She\u2019s so little.\u201d He stroked her cheek and she turned her head.</p><p>Then she opened her eyes.</p><p>And Jack Donohue fell completely in love for the second time in his life.</p><p>Jack wasn\u2019t surprised when the nurse told him that Keely\u2019s parents had remained in the waiting room.</p><p>After getting Keely settled in upstairs, and fed, he tracked them down. \u201cCome and meet your new granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn practically tackle-hugged him.</p><p>Carson just grinned.</p><p>Keely was propped up in bed, looking exhausted, but absolutely serene. \u201cHey. I can\u2019t believe you guys stayed after the way I acted...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready forgotten, dear.\u201d Carolyn patted her shoulder. \u201cSo, let\u2019s see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Piper McKay Donohue.\u201d Keely unwrapped the blanket and pushed the hat back.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, that child has red hair. Well that\u2019s a first in the McKay family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carson peered and the baby and smiled. \u201cHey, girlie.

And her grandmamma.\u201d</p><p>Keely teared up but she held it together.</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t pictures of my mom around, but she was a natural redhead,\u201d Carson offered.</p><p>Jack kissed his daughter\u2019s head and pulled the hat back down. \u201cWhen I called my mom, she said her mother was a redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all the dark-haired babies born into this family...leave it to Keely to do something different.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been a long day for everyone, so Carson and Carolyn stayed about ten minutes.</p><p>Jack walked them to the elevator.</p><p>Before Carson got in, he clapped Jack on the back and choked out, \u201cNow, son, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy I am the way I am about my daughter. Now you\u2019ll know what it\u2019s like to have a baby girl who lights up your entire world.\u201d</p><p>The doors closed, leaving Jack feeling like he and Carson McKay had finally found common ground after all.</p><p>All Knocked Up: Chapter Three</p><p>Two months later...</p><p>\u201cKeely, I think she\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Keely put the lid on the potatoes and walked over to where Jack stood, holding Piper. The man was always holding Piper. If he was home, their daughter was in his arms. He was a doting father absolutely smitten with their child. They both were just giddy about their girl.</p><p>They\u2019d adjusted to parenthood much quicker than expected. Mostly because Piper was a ridiculously good baby. She slept for a few hours at a time and only had one fussy night feeding. And Jack insisted on handling that one.</p><p>Keely peered at Piper\u2019s face as she wiggled and made snuffling, working-up-to-a-big-cry noises. She stroked her chubby cheek. Immediately Piper turned and rooted around looking for food. \u201cPoor starving girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet settled. I\u2019ll bring her to you.\u201d</p><p>She planted herself in the middle of the couch and lifted her shirt. She hadn\u2019t been sure how she\u2019d do nursing, but so far so good. And her boobs were huge, which caused more discomfort, and less look at my huge hooters! pride than she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>Jack handed Piper off to her, but sat on Keely\u2019s left side, snuggled close to watch their baby feed.</p> <p>Keely breathed a sigh of relief as the tiny mouth latched onto the nipple and her milk let down.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how big she\u2019s getting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin said she\u2019ll be asking for the car keys before we know it.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine. Let\u2019s enjoy every second of her being entirely helpless.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, after Piper had been tucked into her bassinet, Keely lingered in the bathroom, psyching herself up.</p><p>So they hadn\u2019t had sex in eight weeks. Getting back into the swing of it shouldn\u2019t be hard, right?</p><p>Keely\u2019s image in the bathroom mirror didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>She sucked in her stomach, but the pouch of fat didn\u2019t budge. But if she was lying down, then her stomach would look flat. Maybe even sort of close to her pre-pregnancy size.</p><p>She fluffed her hair into the just-tumbled-out-of-bed style Jack loved. Although lingerie would hide the curvier aspect to her ass and hips, getting it on was too much trouble. Her husband tore the lace and satin off her in record time anyway.</p><p>Hand on hip, she practiced a \u201ccome and get it\u201d smile. Then she opened the door and sauntered into the bedroom.</p><p>Jack sat on the edge of the bed. Her gaze tracked his body. He had the sexiest back. Wide shoulders, rippling muscles tapering into a narrow waist. He\u2019d maintained his drool-inducing physique with the same rigorous attention to fitness as he gave to his business.</p><p>So what will he think of her extra softness?</p><p>Call it what it is, Keely. Not extra softness. Extra pounds.</p><p>Man, her body image was for shit today. Maybe this wasn\u2019t the best idea.</p><p>But when Jack glanced over his shoulder at her, gifting her with his sexy grin, she was pretty much toast.</p><p>She crawled onto the bed and followed the curve of his spine with just one finger. She spread her hands over his back, from the bottom of his shoulder blades to the top.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, wife?\u201d</p><p>Her damp lips touched his right ear. \u201cJust admiring the view.\u201d She let her mouth connect with his nape as her arms twined around his torso.</p><p>Jack released a soft groan when her thumbs brushed over his nipples.</p><p>\u201cI love that noise,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI love touching you like this.\u201d</p><p>He hissed when she sank her teeth into the arch of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Jack.\u201d Her hands slid down the front of his body to the drawstring on his sweatpants. \u201cI want you in my mouth before you pin me to the mattress and fuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor gave you the green light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Keely blew in his ear. \u201cLast week. But we\u2019ve been so baby preoccupied or tired, or the timing has been off.\u201d She tugged on his earlobe. \u201cSo are we in synch tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect synch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Crawl up here and lemme put a smile on your face.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed the tips of her fingers before disentangling her arms. Then he stood and ditched his sweatpants. Not a shock he\u2019d gone commando. She allowed a smug smile she\u2019d already gotten him hard.</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands and kissed her. Not the sweet, lazy kisses they\u2019d shared over the past two months, but a white-hot explosion of passion. Keely had to wrap her hands around his wrists to keep from toppling over backward.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want you on your knees in front of me,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>\u201cMy idea. I get to be in charge. Besides, do you really care what position I\u2019m in as long as my mouth is around your cock?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly and pulled away. He stretched out on the bed, spreading his legs and resting his hands behind his head like he was watching TV.</p><p>\u201cIs this a challenge?\u201d She scooted between his thighs and let her hair swing across his groin, bracing her hands by his hips. \u201cBecause I\u2019m up for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Her wet tongue followed the rim of his cockhead, stopping only to flick the sweet spot. Or to go round and round the engorged tip until his belly muscles quivered.</p><p>Keeping her eyes on his, she parted her lips, opened her throat and swallowed him.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>She intended to work him with her mouth. Tease and retreat. Build him up and back off. So when he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he\u2019d take her. Face to face. Basic boring, missionary style sex. But missionary position was anything but boring with Jack Donohue. It\u2019d been six long months since they\u2019d been able to do it that way. And she couldn\u2019t wait to be pressed beneath the weight of his body and look into his eyes while he made her come undone.</p><p>But first she tortured him. Using every trick she\u2019d ever learned with her teeth, her lips, and her tongue to keep him on edge.</p><p>Heady stuff, hearing him groan. Feeling his hips buck up. Knowing he clenched his ass cheeks to try and retain some control. Her oral worship of his cock made her equally squirmy. Her skin tingled from her scalp to her toes. Her pussy was drenched.</p><p>\u201cKeely. You\u2019re killing me here. I can\u2019t hold off.\u201d</p><p>Those were the magic words. She raised her head and trailed her hair up his torso as she levered her body over his.</p><p>The next thing she knew she\u2019d been flipped on her back and Jack hung above her. \u201cAs much as I love seeing my come on your face, I much prefer the look on your face when I do this.\u201d He plunged into her to the hilt.</p><p>Keely arched hard. \u201cYes. More like that. A lot more.\u201d</p><p>Jack pressed a kiss on her collarbone. \u201cCan\u2019t. Gotta slow it down.\u201d He rolled his hips. A steady slide in; a leisurely retreat out.</p><p>She drummed her heels on his ass. \u201cJack. Go faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers mapped the muscles in his arms. The smooth arc of his shoulders. The strong line of his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, GQ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking pretty,\u201d he half-snarled.</p><p>\u201cSo very pretty,\u201d she whispered in his ear. Her mouth followed the corded tendon in his neck, loving the taste of him on her tongue.</p><p>Jack kissed her in that bone-melting way of his, giving her that fluttery feeling in her belly. She thought for sure her \u201cpretty\u201d comment would have him all fired up to prove his rougher side.</p><p>Wait...was there another reason he kept the pace so slow besides his need to constantly prove his \u201cme man, me satisfy my woman\u201d mantra? Could there be a...physical difference for him?</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d she panted against his throat.</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny different? Looser or whatever?\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled back and looked down at her. \u201cFeels like I\u2019m making love to my wife after a long stretch of not making love to my wife.\u201d He threaded his fingers through hers and pinned her arms above her head on the mattress. \u201cWatch my face.\u201d His hips began to move again, more forcefully as his cock shuttled in and out of her.</p><p>She could never get tired of looking at him. This stunning man who was perfect inside and out. Perfect because he got her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing. Just thinking that I missed seeing you like this, moving above me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed it too. And you\u2019re about to get your request for me to move faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out completely and thrust in fully on every stroke. It was glorious reminder how in tune they were with each other. Such a secret thrill to realize having a baby hadn\u2019t changed this between them.</p><p>Her breath caught. So close.</p><p>\u201cCome on, buttercup. Take me with you.\u201d</p><p>The instant she felt the tingling in her groin, signaling her orgasm was about to start, she felt the other tingling sensation in her breasts. The one indicating that her milk was about to let down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. Not now.</p><p>Jack had switched into a pushup position, his pelvis grinding against her clit on every thrust, knowing that set her off.</p><p>But instead of an outstanding orgasm, Keely watched in silent horror as milk shot out of her nipples and coated Jack\u2019s chest. Milk dripped back onto her even as more milk squirted out.</p> <p>He stopped moving.</p><p>She\u2019d immediately clapped her palms over her breasts to try and stop the spray.</p><p>Omigod omigod omigod this can\u2019t be happening repeated on a loop in her brain. Her entire body flushed with mortification. \u201cGet off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said get off me right now!\u201d She shoved him at him.</p> <p>Jack pushed upright. \u201cKeely? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She rolled off the bed and ran into the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Locking the door behind her.</p><p>Keely stepped into the shower and cranked it on cold, standing under the spray despite her chattering teeth, hoping the shock of icy water would shut down her milk ducts.</p><p>Don\u2019t you mean your udders?</p><p>Some days she felt like nothing but a milk machine. And she really had become one tonight. A faulty one, spewing milk all over her husband. While they\u2019d finally been...</p> <p>She shuffled away from the streaming water, pressed her forehead to the shower wall and sobbed.</p><p>Was this really how it\u2019d go? She couldn\u2019t even have sex with her husband because if she orgasmed she\u2019d do her Bessie the milk cow imitation all over him?</p><p>Despite the frigid temp of the shower, her cheeks still burned with shame.</p><p>Would Jack look at her breasts warily? Would he even touch them again?</p><p>She cried harder. Feeling such a sense of loss.</p><p>The water shut off.</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked the goddamned door for a reason, Jack. Go away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d His warm body covered hers. \u201cAt first I thought I\u2019d hurt you when I\u2019d picked up the pace.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Made her feel even worse that he thought he\u2019d hurt her and she\u2019d just left him there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. So if you want to stand here naked in the shower all night, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>She hunched her back away from him.</p><p>His mouth skated along the slope of her shoulder. \u201cBut I\u2019d really like to finish what we started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already gave you one milk bath,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou wanna go for two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. If it means I get to be inside you.\u201d He nipped the section of skin on her nape that made her knees buckle. \u201cIf it means I get to touch you, and look into your eyes so you see how much I love touching you. See how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>Keely sniffled. \u201cYou are such a smooth-talking bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty. But that\u2019s how you like me best. Will you turn around and look at me please?\u201d</p><p>As soon as she did Jack was in her face.</p><p>\u201cThis kind of shit happens. And baby, we are married. We\u2019re immune to each other\u2019s bodily functions. So why did you freak out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s embarrassing. And probably makes you never wanna touch my tits again.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her breasts. \u201cWrong. I love your tits. It\u2019s just right now they\u2019ve got a bigger purpose than entertaining me.\u201d He stroked his thumb over her nipple and she hissed. \u201cSee? You\u2019re sore from nursing. I tried not to rub against them because I won\u2019t add to your pain with something that\u2019s supposed to give you pleasure. I\u2019ll wait my turn until Piper is done with them.\u201d He ran his fingers along her collarbone and up her neck. \u201cThere are lots of other places on your body I love to touch besides your tits. I could show you if you\u2019d like, sexy wife.\u201d</p><p>Keely started to cry again.</p><p>A panicked look crossed his face. \u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly the perfect thing.\u201d She placed her hand over his heart. \u201cHow did I get so lucky that you fell in love with me? And you\u2019re still with me after my random bouts of craziness?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a gentle, loving kiss as her answer.</p><p>She rested her forehead against his chest. \u201cSorry I ruined our sexy time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. We just had a break in the activities. Which is a good thing because my stamina sure isn\u2019t what it was two months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s pick up where we left off, right here in the shower. That way if it happens again, we won\u2019t care. We\u2019ll already be wet.\u201d</p><p>Keely reached behind him and turned the water on.</p><p>Jack yelped when the cold hit his back.</p><p>But the water heated up. So did the kisses and the frantic touches between them.</p><p>Jack grabbed her ass and urged, \u201cJump up.\u201d Then he pressed her against the wall, using his body strength to hold hers in place. He locked his burning gaze to hers and impaled her. \u201cGod I love the look in your eyes when I do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do it some more.\u201d She raked her nails down his back. \u201cAnd then do it some more again. Because we have a lot of time to make up for.\u201d</p><p>Two months later...at Piper\u2019s four-month checkup</p><p>\u201cI hate bringing her to the doctor with all these sick people around,\u201d Jack said after they\u2019d checked in at the clinic.</p><p>\u201cJust keep the cover over her carrier and no one will bug her.\u201d But Keely chose seats in the corner just to be safe.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to work tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I feel better.\u201d She\u2019d caught a nasty flu bug in the last week that\u2019d knocked her flat. Luckily she hadn\u2019t passed it on to either Piper or Jack. She\u2019d made light of it, but it worried her because it\u2019d lingered longer than normal.</p><p>Jack flipped through a parenting magazine before setting it aside with a sigh. \u201cYou sure you\u2019ll be okay while I\u2019m gone? Because I can postpone the trip.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll miss you, but our work lives didn\u2019t end just because we have a baby.\u201d Keely had returned to her rehab clinic last month. Two days a week she took Piper to work with her and on the full schedule days, Piper went to the daycare at Sky Blue, which should be renamed McKay daycare, since nearly all the kids were family members.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just having a harder time than I thought leaving you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we are pretty damn cool.\u201d</p><p>Jack lifted a dark eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cPretty darn cool,\u201d she amended. They\u2019d been trying to clean up their language around Piper, figuring it\u2019d take them both two years to get a handle on it.</p><p>\u201cPiper Donohue?\u201d the nurse called out.</p><p>Jack picked up the carrier and they followed the nurse through the maze leading to the examination rooms.</p><p>After they were settled, Doc Monroe poked her head in. \u201cI\u2019m running behind today guys, if you want to see Griffin the PA, I\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should run a flu test on me while we\u2019re waiting.\u201d</p><p>Doc Monroe came all the way into the room and scrutinized Keely. \u201cDid you get a flu shot this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical flu symptoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNausea. Headaches. I throw up, which is weird because I don\u2019t eat much. I\u2019m clammy then I\u2019m hot. Tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a week,\u201d Keely admitted and shot an apologetic look at her husband.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll run tests so if you test positive we can offer Piper and Jack preventative treatment. I\u2019ll get you to the lab.\u201d</p><p>Keely had a blood sample taken. A urine sample taken. The worst one was the nose mucus sample. She slipped back into the exam room and sat next to Jack, who\u2019d\u2014big surprise\u2014taken Piper out of her carrier and was holding her.</p><p>Piper grinned and kicked her feet at seeing her mama. Their daughter was beyond adorable\u2014however she looked nothing like Keely or Jack with her dark red hair and big green eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful girl. Those smiles are gonna disappear when they come in and stick you with needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many shots does she get today?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cThree, I think.\u201d She rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, GQ. Hurry back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But you could give me something to remember you by tonight.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cWhen did you start taking testosterone? Because you are as horny as a teenage boy lately.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed her, sweet and slow and deep. \u201cWhat can I say? My wife is smoking hot.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cGuys complain about their wives losing interest in sex after having a baby. But what do any of them do to fix it? If it\u2019s important it\u2019ll be a priority. It\u2019ll always be a priority for me. For us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that about you.\u201d</p><p>Another forty minutes passed and Keely was ready to climb the walls, even when Piper was content to sit on Daddy\u2019s lap and coo and babble at him.</p><p>Finally Doc Monroe swept in. \u201cSorry. Jack, why don\u2019t you get little miss stripped to her diaper so I can check her out.\u201d Then she looked at Keely and smirked. \u201cGood news? Negative for flu. The other good news? You\u2019re pregnant.\u201d She set a big bottle of prenatal vitamins on the counter. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Keely and Jack said simultaneously. \u201cBut how can that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat birth control measures were you using?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, none, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Doc Monroe lifted her hand. \u201cPlease do not tell me you listened to that old wives tale about not being able to get pregnant while you\u2019re nursing.\u201d</p><p>Keely blushed. Then she whapped Jack on the arm. \u201cI cannot believe you knocked me up again, Jack Donohue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way. It\u2019s another first in the McKay family with your Irish twins.\u201d At Jack and Keely\u2019s blank looks, she clarified, \u201cTwo babies born within a calendar year.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned and Keely whapped his arm again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All Knocked Up: Chapter Four</p><p>Seven and a half months later...</p><p>\u201cCome on, Keely, breathe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am breathing, you bastard. Ow. Fuck. Goddamn that hurts.\u201d</p><p>Jack opened his mouth to remind her about language but Keely\u2019s death stare kept him quiet.</p><p>Swearing rules didn\u2019t apply during labor.</p><p>After the contraction ended, she reached for the towel only to have Jack already there, gently mopping her face. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He kissed her temple. \u201cThis one seems to be going faster than the last one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot fast enough for me,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHold on. Here comes another. Breathe with me.\u201d</p><p>When it ended, she panted, \u201cJack. They\u2019re getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to get the nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>As Keely waited for his cue for the next one, she had that same surreal sensation she had last year\u2014the urge to flee. She needed to focus on something else. Her darling daughter.</p> <p>Hard to believe Piper would be a year old in three weeks. Being two weeks early should\u2019ve been an indication she\u2019d do everything early. She\u2019d walked at nine months and started talking at ten months. Of course her first word was Daddy.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re thinking about Piper. I texted your mom,\u201d Jack said. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s following Avery everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Since Cord and AJ\u2019s little girl Avery and Piper were nine months apart\u2014same age difference as Keely and AJ\u2014Cord and Jack already were already strategizing how to keep the girls from running wild.</p><p>Yeah, good luck with that, Keely\u2019s dad had told them.</p><p>\u201cKeely, get ready.\u201d</p><p>The contractions came hard and fast. Time was divided in two: during a contraction and the break between contractions. She\u2019d blocked much of her labor out last year. The pain had been unimaginable; she hadn\u2019t known how she\u2019d survive it. And then soon as the baby popped out, pain gone. Completely.</p><p>But until that point? Hell. Which she was in right now.</p><p>The nurse came in and checked her. \u201cWow, lady, you\u2019re at nine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cTwo hours ago she was at five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond babies are quicker. Her body knows what to do. I\u2019ll get the doc. Get your scrubs on.\u201d</p><p>The next ten minutes were an exercise in control as Keely breathed through the need to push.</p><p>After Doctor Monroe arrived, and she could finally give in to that urge, it only took two tries and the baby was out.</p><p>Breathing hard, dizzy, hot, and sore, Keely still managed to sit up and look at the baby in Doc\u2019s hands. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cNext time I\u2019m getting you pregnant in the summer so you don\u2019t freeze the stem off another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m kidding, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>Then the blonde baby girl was placed on her stomach. Blonde? Where the hell had that hair color come from?</p><p>\u201cLook at her.\u201d Jack murmured, \u201cHey, precious. Welcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>She screwed up her face and let out a loud cry.</p><p>\u201cHealthy set of lungs on her.\u201d Doc Monroe cut the cord and the nurses whisked the baby away.</p><p>No, bring her back! I hardly got to see her.</p><p>\u201cYou were fierce in labor this time, beautiful wife of mine. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d He kissed her temple. \u201cThank you for adding another perfect girl to my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy that Piper has a sister.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cI love my brothers, but after seeing how close my mom and my aunt are, I always wanted a sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll provide them with a brother next time.\u201d He chuckled at her look of shock. \u201cWhat? Carolyn kept birthing babies until she had a girl, so in some ways, it is a family tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are reaching, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Doc Monroe walked over with the baby bundle. \u201cShe weighed in at seven pounds, fourteen ounces and she\u2019s twenty-three inches long.\u201d She handed Jack the baby. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at Keely. \u201cKatie McKay Donohue.\u201d</p><p>The medical personnel picked up their stuff and they were gone.</p><p>\u201cLet me hold her,\u201d Keely demanded.</p><p>\u201cIn a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna hog this baby too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Two months later...</p><p>Jack came up behind Keely and wrapped his arms around her, placing a kiss on the side of her neck. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself, handsome. What\u2019s up?\u201d She rubbed her ass into his groin. \u201cBesides your cock?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s always your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girls are down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. Sleeping like the precious angels they are\u2014until devil child Katie screams like a banshee and wakes them both up.\u201d Jack angled her head to the side and continued kissing her neck. \u201cSo we have a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo mark the special occasion by getting naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Are you talking about the all clear from the doc to resume sexual relations with my husband special occasion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just that special occasion, smart mouth. Although that is a happy coincidence.\u201d He nuzzled the back of her head, breathing in the lilac scent of her shampoo. \u201cI started the fireplace in the living room. Poured two glasses of red wine. Turned on a CD of that sappy goat-yodeling music you love so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, GQ. Did you roll out a bearskin rug too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. I knew I forgot something.\u201d He tugged on her earlobe until she hissed. \u201cCome on, cowgirl. Let me be romantic and seduce you instead of throwing you on the tile right here in the kitchen and banging your brains out.\u201d</p><p>Keely faced him. Kissed him. Twined herself around him. \u201cI prefer the hard bang after nine weeks and four days of no bang. But I\u2019ll indulge you and let you make sweet, sweet love to me. Let me grab the condoms.\u201d</p><p>Jack froze. \u201cCondoms? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I hate condoms. We haven\u2019t used them in years.\u201d</p><p>She drilled her finger into his chest. \u201cSuck it up. No glove, no love. I\u2019m not kiddin\u2019, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if I pull out?\u201d he asked hopefully.</p><p>Keely growled at him. \u201cDo you want to get laid tonight or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Condoms it is.\u201d</p><p>Jack did an awesome job seducing her\u2014if he did say so himself. Making her come twice before he got started on the main event. And yeah, it hadn\u2019t been too bad wearing a condom after Keely had used her mouth to put it on.</p><p>They both were too far gone, too desperate to reconnect for slow and steady to last very long. Each hard thrust into Keely\u2019s hot, wet cunt sent him closer to the edge. Her breathy moans in his ear. Each lift of her hips as she met him thrust for thrust. Then Jack was there, falling headlong into the hot wash of pleasure he only got from being body to body, skin to skin, heart to heart with the woman who owned him. The woman who loved him and gave him more joy in his life than he ever imagined possible.</p><p>After he\u2019d regained his ability to think, and after he\u2019d kissed Keely so thoroughly his cock was on board for round two, he eased out of her.</p><p>That\u2019s when Jack saw the condom had broken.</p><p>He must\u2019ve worn a horrified look, because Keely pushed up on her elbows and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. You did get that condom on all the way, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor cryin\u2019 out loud, I know how to put on a...omigod the goddamned condom broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Keely got right in his face. \u201cSo help me God if you got me pregnant again Jack Donohue, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack gave her a smacking kiss on the mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ll what? Stop having sex with me? Not likely. You won\u2019t adore another baby like you adore the two beautiful babies we already have? Not likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a sweet-talkin\u2019 man even after you got your pole polished? Wow. I\u2019m one lucky broad.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou have to admit we\u2019ve got this baby-making thing down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, practice does make perfect, and we\u2019ve gotten in a lot of practice over the years.\u201d</p><p>Jack touched the side of her face. \u201cWould you be upset if...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour supersonic sperm reached the goal once again?\u201d Keely shook her head. \u201cWe tried to do the responsible thing. If it happens, it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we can skip the condoms for round two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, but not a chance in hell.\u201d She tossed him another condom. \u201cThis one is all on you.\u201d She kissed him and rested her forehead against his. \u201cHappy anniversary, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy anniversary, Keely.\u201d</p><p>Jack made love to her again. Slower. Sweeter. Wearing her out to the point she\u2019d drifted off to sleep in his arms.</p><p>He didn\u2019t panic when he saw they\u2019d broken another condom. He\u2019d tell her later. For now he let her sleep. Chances were very good she\u2019d need extra sleep in the coming months.</p><p>Seven months later...</p><p>\u201cPiper McKay Donohue, get down from there right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Get down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>A chuckle sounded beside her.</p><p>Keely looked at her father. \u201cDaddy, this is not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt surely is. Pipsqueak climbs everything like Cam did, but her defiant tone is all you, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Piper started jumping on the couch. Her red pigtails bounced. The bells on her sock jingled, which made her giggle. A devious giggle if Keely had ever heard one. She pushed herself to get out of the recliner.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Stay put,\u201d her dad warned. \u201cI\u2019ll get her.\u201d Grandpa scooped her up with one arm. \u201cNo jumpin\u2019 on the furniture, okay, Pipsqueak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cK.\u201d Piper squirmed to be let down. As soon as her feet hit the floor she made a beeline for the couch again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grandpa laughed and grabbed her, throwing her over his shoulder amidst her happy shrieks. \u201cYou are gonna be some trouble little miss.\u201d He walked over and deposited Piper on the floor. \u201cSit with your mama for a minute while I see what Gran-gran is doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Piper scrambled onto the end of the recliner between Keely\u2019s knees and laid her head on Keely\u2019s enormous belly. \u201cHi babies.\u201d</p><p>Keely smoothed the damp ringlets from Piper\u2019s forehead. It was doubtful almost two-year old Piper understood the concept of babies inside the gigantic bump, but she said hi to the babies at least ten times a day anyway.</p> <p>It\u2019d come as a shock to learn she carried twins, especially so soon after Katie\u2019s birth. High blood pressure complications with this pregnancy meant she\u2019d been on bed rest since the fifth month, which wasn\u2019t too bad since she wanted to be home with Piper and Katie anyway. Her family had pitched in to keep her company after Jack insisted someone be with her at all times. He\u2019d cut back on his work schedule, so he was home at least part of every day. But today he\u2019d had to drive into Rapid City for a meeting that couldn\u2019t be handled over the phone or via email.</p><p>Piper looked up at her. Those big green eyes\u2014eyes just like Jack\u2019s\u2014were serious and a little devilish. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMy tummy is making some loud noises. Think the babies might be hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hungry too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ask Gran-gran for a snack. But no cookies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cK.\u201d Piper shot her mother a smug look before she leapt off the recliner and tore off into the kitchen.</p><p>Keely wiggled in the seat, trying to get comfortable. She felt heavier today like something had shifted down low in her abdomen. Movement made her nauseous so she hadn\u2019t done anything but sit for the last hour. Still, her heart raced like mad. Her fingers and toes tingled. Her shallow breathing increased the sensation of dizziness. This was not normal.</p><p>She put down the foot rest and set her feet on the floor. Had her toes fallen asleep? She couldn\u2019t feel the rug beneath her, just more of those sharp tingles.</p><p>Her mom came around the corner carrying Katie, who immediately started saying, \u201cMama, Mama, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, sweet pea.\u201d</p><p>Katie shrieked and pushed away from Gran-gran, reaching for Keely desperately as if she hadn\u2019t seen in her days, not minutes. Her mom set her down. Katie toddled over, her brown eyes teeming with tears, her blond hair sticking up in every direction. She clutched the side of the recliner. \u201cMama, Mama, Mama.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s naptime and you want a story, huh?\u201d</p><p>Katie tried to crawl in her lap and Keely\u2019s heart about broke. Katie was such a sweet, snuggly baby, but Keely didn\u2019t have the strength to pick her up right now.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart? Are you okay? Your face is bright red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d better call Jack and have him get me to the doctor.\u201d A spike of pain hit her, like she was being ripped apart from the inside out. Then she felt a rush of wetness between her legs.</p><p>Alarmed, Keely looked down expecting to see water, but blood stained her shorts. Blood. A lot of blood. Oh God. Panicked, she stood abruptly.</p><p>Too abruptly. All the blood rushed from her head and she lost her balance. Black spots obscured her vision.</p><p>Her mom screamed, \u201cKeely!\u201d</p><p>Everything switched into slow motion. She knew she was going down but she couldn\u2019t make her arms work to break the fall.</p> <p>Two strong arms caught her. \u201cWhoa, girlie. I gotcha.\u201d But she and her dad both ended up on the floor anyway.</p><p>Keely couldn\u2019t breathe. Her belly started to cramp like she\u2019d never felt. She groaned with pain. What was happening?</p><p>\u201cCaro, call an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>Keely whispered, \u201cNo. Call Jack. Call him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. But we\u2019ve gotta get you to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body shuddered with cold. Those swirling black and white spots were back. Her head felt like it was beneath a waterfall.</p><p>Yet she heard Katie crying. Hysterical I-want-my-Mama shrieks. Then Piper joined in. Keely needed to get to her children to calm them down, but she couldn\u2019t even move.</p><p>Rough-skinned hands stroked her face. \u201cStay still. Stay with me baby girl.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cCaro, get the girls out of here,\u201d her dad said sharply.</p><p>The distressed cries of her daughters vanished.</p><p>Keely fell into a state of nothingness until the pain came again and her entire body convulsed from the power of it.</p><p>Voices rose and fell around her. She tried to concentrate on just one to pull her out of the void. Her dad\u2019s was the loudest.</p><p>\u201cYou are stayin\u2019 here,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019m ridin\u2019 in the ambulance with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Carson that doesn\u2019t make sense. She needs me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now those little girls need you more. And sugar, you\u2019re close to hysterical. That ain\u2019t gonna help her. Jack\u2019s gonna need someone to calm him down and you\u2019re in no shape to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI have to be.\u201d</p><p>Loud noises, activity and more voices surrounded her. Then the world went black as Keely slipped into unconsciousness.</p><p>All Knocked Up: Chapter Five</p><p>After the phone call from Carson, Jack kept the speedometer at one hundred miles per hour as he drove from Rapid City to Spearfish. And Cam must\u2019ve pulled some strings because no one stopped him.</p><p>He\u2019d contacted Doc Monroe but she\u2019d already gone to the hospital in Spearfish to consult on Keely\u2019s behalf. Then he\u2019d talked to Keely\u2019s mom to make sure Piper and Katie were taken care of. Keely\u2019s sisters-in-law were on their way to take over so Carolyn could go to the hospital.</p><p>He glared at the dashboard clock. It\u2019d been forty-five minutes since he\u2019d received the call and he was still ten miles from Spearfish.</p><p>If anything happened to Keely he\u2019d...</p><p>No. Don\u2019t go there. Just drive.</p><p>Everything became a blur until he arrived at the hospital.</p><p>He ran through the emergency room doors.</p><p>The nurse said, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely Donohue. Arrived via ambulance from Sundance?\u201d</p><p>She pointed to the door marked Stairs. \u201cThey can help you on the third floor.\u201d</p><p>He scaled the stairs two at a time. Before he reached the receptionist\u2019s desk, Carson approached him.</p><p>\u201cHow is she? Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re prepping her for emergency surgery.\u201d</p><p>Jack had to brace his hand against the wall to keep his knees from buckling. \u201cI want to be with her. I need to be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be. Believe me, I asked.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. The next medical person he saw would be taking him to Keely. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stood up, blood rushed out and she passed out. The EMTs didn\u2019t say much on the ride here.\u201d Carson cleared his throat. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the surgical waiting area. Maybe they\u2019ll have more news.\u201d</p><p>The waiting room was empty, giving Jack room to pace. He went through a checklist of a dozen things he should\u2019ve done. And two dozen things he shouldn\u2019t have done. Like get her pregnant again. It\u2019d seemed funny and surreal, three pregnancies in three years. But he wasn\u2019t laughing about it now.</p><p>If she dies, it\u2019s your fault.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He wanted to punch the fucking wall.</p><p>\u201cJack. Take it easy. You look like you\u2019re gonna pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I can\u2019t fucking breathe until I know if she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>A nurse in scrubs came into the room and Jack immediately loomed over her. \u201cI want to see my goddamned wife. Take me to her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Just as soon as someone tells me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor will be out here to talk to you at some point.\u201d</p><p>At some point? Why were they being so vague about where Keely was? \u201cNot good enough. I want answers now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold it together, son,\u201d Carson warned.</p><p>Jack set his hands on the nurse\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI swear to Christ if something\u2019s happened to her and you people are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir. Let me go or I\u2019ll have security remove you from the premises.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d grabbed her. He stepped back, embarrassed as well as angry. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d already stormed off.</p><p>Then Carson was in his face. \u201cThis ain\u2019t helpin\u2019 anyone, least of all you. So sit the hell down and shut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Harsh words. Jack\u2019s response was just as harsh. \u201cAnd you\u2019d sit in the corner like a fucking lap dog if Carolyn was behind those goddamned doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d\u2019ve already ripped the doors off the hinges. But I\u2019m askin\u2019 you to be the better man than me, Donohue. Keely is gonna need you there by her side when she comes out of this.\u201d</p><p>If she comes out of it. If she\u2019s all right.</p><p>Carson poked him in the chest. \u201cGet that look off your face. I will not allow myself to imagine anything but good goddamned news coming through those doors and you\u2019d better not either.\u201d He paused. \u201cBecause I\u2019m havin\u2019 a hard time breathing myself.\u201d</p><p>They stared at one another.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll sit.\u201d That lasted for about five minutes. Jack got up and paced. His brain tossed out all sorts of fucked-up theories that he wished would just stop.</p><p>Carson stayed close by his side. When he wasn\u2019t staring aimlessly out the window.</p><p>Jack felt every single tick of the clock in a slow drip of time eating away at his patience.</p><p>It was the most excruciating sixty-seven minutes of his life.</p><p>The doors opened and he was on his feet before they closed.</p><p>Doc Monroe, in blue scrubs, stood next to another woman in blue scrubs.</p><p>\u201cHow is Keely?\u201d</p><p>The other doctor said, \u201cShe had a placental abruption.\u201d Then she launched into an explanation of what it was and added that she suspected Keely had suffered from preeclampsia, which had Jack seeing red because he wanted to know how the fuck his wife was doing, not be subjected to a lesson on medical terminology. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Doc Monroe interrupted. \u201cWhat Dr. Janis here, the OB who did the surgery, is getting at, is Keely is in recovery. We had to put her under for the emergency C-section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s...?\u201d</p><p>Doc Monroe put her hand on his arm. \u201cShe\u2019s fine, Jack.\u201d</p> <p>His relief wouldn\u2019t kick in until he saw her. \u201cWhen can I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be in recovery at least another hour. Then we\u2019ll move her to a post-op room.\u201d The two doctors exchanged a look. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know about the babies?\u201d</p><p>Christ. How had he forgotten? \u201cAre they all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby boy one is having some breathing difficulties, but it\u2019s to be expected given his placenta detached. Baby boy two is perfectly healthy with no trouble whatsoever showcasing his lung capacity. The birth weights were in normal range for twins born at thirty-six weeks.\u201d</p><p>Carson clapped him on the back. \u201cCongrats.\u201d</p> <p>Jack still couldn\u2019t wrap his head around two babies and they\u2019d had months to prepare.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to meet your sons?\u201d Doc Monroe asked.</p><p>\u201cI have to see Keely first.\u201d</p><p>More exchanged looks.</p><p>\u201cSounds strange, I know, but I want to be with her when we see our babies for the first time.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cIs there any way I can stay in recovery with her until she wakes up? I promise I won\u2019t do anything but sit beside her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJoely. Please. I\u2019m dying here.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Carolyn rushed in the room. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely\u2019s in recovery and the babies appear to be fine.\u201d Carson wrapped an arm around her and pressed his lips into her hair. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen them yet.\u201d</p><p>That gave Jack an idea. \u201cCan I give them permission to go do all the baby stuff while I\u2019m with Keely?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Janis shrugged. \u201cYour call, Dr. Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with it.\u201d She smirked. \u201cAnother first in the McKay family. Grandpa and Grandma get to meet the babies before the parents.\u201d</p><p>Jack finally allowed himself to smile.</p> <p>Jack held Keely\u2019s hand. He only took his eyes off her to look at the monitor. Not that he understood what the lines meant but they hadn\u2019t changed, which was a good thing.</p><p>The nurse came in every ten minutes and checked her.</p><p>But Keely didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>He pressed her palm against his cheek, wishing she\u2019d wake up and bitch at him for being too lazy to shave.</p><p>Time passed in a void, but he didn\u2019t have a sense of helplessness because he was with her. Didn\u2019t matter if she wasn\u2019t aware he was by her side.</p><p>Then her fingers twitched and he was instantly alert.</p><p>Keely opened her eyes. She blinked several times and cast a panicked glance around the room before seeing him. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby.\u201d He shot to his feet and framed her face in his hands before he kissed her. Once. Twice. By the third time his eyes were wet. He whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Her confused eyes searched his. \u201cWhy are you cryin\u2019? Did something happen to the babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re both fine. I just...\u201d He pressed kisses on her beautiful face. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough day and I went half-crazy thinking I\u2019d never get to say those words to you again. You scared the life out of me, Keely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d He kissed her again\u2014he couldn\u2019t seem to stop kissing her, touching her, breathing her in. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Tears trickled from the corners of her eyes. \u201cI hurt everywhere.\u201d</p><p>That was a punch to the gut. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t get you a painkiller. But first I want to tell you...\u201d Jack buried his face in her neck. \u201cNo more,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the who-can-have-the-most-kids competition you\u2019ve got going on with your crazy-ass baby-making brothers and cousins, but we\u2019re done. No more pregnancies. I can\u2019t\u2014I won\u2019t\u2014put you through this again. If anything happened to you, Keely, I\u2019d...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. You are my world, you are my everything, and I\u2019d never recover from losing you. Never. I don\u2019t think you understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand; trust me, because I feel the same way.\u201d She touched his face. \u201cHey. I\u2019m right here with you. I\u2019m not goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to Doc Monroe about scheduling a vasectomy as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. We have four kids and that\u2019s plenty. You went under the knife today so it\u2019s my turn to ensure that I never have to go through another day like today.\u201d</p><p>The nurse came in, checked her over, administered the painkiller and made arrangements to move her.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about our boys. Weight, length, hair color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I haven\u2019t seen them yet.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s tired eyes widened. \u201cWhat? Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you and I have this tradition of seeing our babies for the first time together, so I waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet. That\u2019s so...you.\u201d She motioned him closer for a kiss. \u201cThank you.\u201d She rested her forehead to his. \u201cAs anxious as I am to meet our sons, I\u2019m really wrung out. Can we wait a little longer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut but her grip on his hand tightened. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later the nurses wheeled two bassinets into Keely\u2019s private room. \u201cThe baby with the blue tag around his ankle was born first.\u201d Then they left.</p><p>Keely scooted the head of the bed upright. \u201cDoes it give the birth info on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jack peered at the sticker. \u201cThis one was six pounds even. Nineteen inches long.\u201d He leaned over to look at the other sticker. \u201cWow. Exactly the same for this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Jack gently placed the small bundles side by side on the middle of the bed and sat on the opposite end. \u201cUnveiling on the count of three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three.\u201d</p><p>The light blue hats came off first. Jack laughed, looking back and forth between the babies. \u201cBlack hair. I\u2019m surprised one\u2019s isn\u2019t black and the other\u2019s brown. Then we\u2019d have every color of hair represented in the Donohue household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening with identical twins, GQ.\u201d</p><p>During the barrage of tests Keely had endured, they\u2019d learned the babies were identical. \u201cSo let\u2019s see how alike they really are.\u201d</p><p>The boys squalled when they were stripped down to their diapers. But Jack and Keely examined every inch of them. They looked at each other with complete bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth will we ever tell them apart? They are identical in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can have India give one of them a tiny tat so they can\u2019t pull the twin-switcheroo on us when they get older,\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>Keely whapped Jack on the arm. \u201cA tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause I was thinking we should have one circumcised and one not. That way we\u2019ll always be able to tell them apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when one of them comes home past curfew when he\u2019s sixteen, you\u2019ll stand on the porch and say, drop your drawers, son, so I know which one of you to punish?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI guess that is a little ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if we just leave the blue band on Jack Jr. for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d She wrapped up the baby closest to her and smooched his cheeks before snuggling him close. \u201cJJ Donohue, you\u2019re gonna be a handsome sucker like your daddy. I just know it.\u201d</p><p>Jack wrapped up the other baby, the one without the blue band and tucked him into the crook of his arm. \u201cSo we\u2019re still naming him Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I\u2019d like his middle name to be Carson. After all the grandsons my dad has, not one has been named after him. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s girl to the core,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of girls...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom promised she\u2019d bring them tomorrow.\u201d Jack noticed Keely\u2019s frown hadn\u2019t gone away. \u201cYou starting to hurt again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not it, is it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHow on earth are we gonna handle four kids? We\u2019re outnumbered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s helpful.\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cJust being honest. But the next eighteen years ought to be interesting.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
