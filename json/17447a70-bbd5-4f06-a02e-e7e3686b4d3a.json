I stopped picking little bits of baby\u2019s breath off the bouquet in my lap, wiping them off the satin of my dress and onto the carpeted floor. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m here. Right here.\u201d</p><p>Where are you? That was the question.</p> <p>Where are you, Dale Diamond?</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Aimee gave her a knowing smirk. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here. He promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking about Dale,\u201d I lied.</p><p>Of course he\u2019d promised. I\u2019d talked to him on the phone late last night. He was already supposed to be in my arms by then, but there had been more excuses.</p><p>I know, I know, but they had us booked to tape some show and there was nothing I could do. I\u2019ll catch the redeye. Don\u2019t worry, sweetheart, I promise. I\u2019ll be home tomorrow.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking about you.\u201d I changed the subject, getting up from my perch on the edge of the counter, putting my bouquet down\u2014pink roses, white ribbons and baby\u2019s breath\u2014to join Aimee in front of the full length mirror where she stood in her wedding gown like something out of a fairy tale. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like finally!\u201d Aimee rolled her eyes, leaning in to check her make-up. \u201cI\u2019ve only been planning for two years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI was the one who helped you pick out the dress, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous isn\u2019t it?\u201d Aimee sighed happily, eyes shining, as she ran her hands down the ivory satin brocade front of her gown. \u201cWhat will Matt think when he sees me?\u201d</p><p>Of course Matt hadn\u2019t seen her in her wedding gown, according to tradition. He was somewhere in the church with his bridegrooms, probably already starting in on the night\u2019s drinking, just to take the edge off the nerves.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to think he\u2019s the luckiest man in the world.\u201d I leaned over and let my lips lightly brush my best friend\u2019s cheek, not wanting to leave a trace of lipstick or gloss. \u201cAnd he is.\u201d</p> <p>Aimee sniffed, her eyes welling up and mine did too and then we were both hugging and laughing and crying a little, digging in our little clutches for Kleenex.</p><p>\u201cOkay you two, break it up!\u201d Wendy insisted as she slipped into the room. Carrie followed, not far behind. They were both wearing the same dress I had on\u2014blush satin, ruched bodice, full skirts that swept the floor when they walked. \u201cThere\u2019s no crying before the wedding pictures!\u201d</p><p>I felt my heart sink when I saw the two of them\u2014not that I didn\u2019t love them both dearly. Next to Aimee, they had become my closest friends since we\u2019d all managed to finally graduate from Iselin Academy, an alternative school for \u201cnon-traditional students.\u201d The latter just meant we were dropouts, for various reasons, and had to do our time. We\u2019d all managed to put in our hours and get our GEDs. Aimee called us the \u201cfour musketeers.\u201d No, it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to see Wendy and Carrie\u2014it was that I\u2019d been hoping it would be Dale.</p><p>Aimee\u2019s eyes brightened when the door opened, meeting Carrie\u2019s dark, heavily made-up eyes. She still managed to look a little punk, even though she\u2019d dyed all the pink streaks out of her hair and it was piled up in short pin-curls on top of her head. Wendy, too, had cleaned up for the wedding, her longer dark hair pulled back and up into a gorgeous, intricate bun, tendrils trailing down beside her pretty, round face. They both looked like goddesses sailing in, fresh and bright with their flower bouquets clutched in their hands.</p><p>\u201cIs it time?\u201d Aimee\u2019s shiny blue eyes widened. It was the first time I thought she looked really nervous.</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Wendy threw herself ungracefully into one of the chairs, tossing her bouquet onto the counter. \u201cThey\u2019re still directing people to sides\u2014his and hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink if we got married, it would be hers and hers?\u201d Carrie put her bouquet next to Wendy\u2019s, edging up to sit on the edge of the counter where I had been seated moments before.</p><p>Wendy gave a short bark of a laugh. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get married in Vegas, let alone in a Catholic church. They\u2019d burn it to the ground first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCatholics are stupid.\u201d I made a face, glancing at Aimee. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s the Catholic, not me.\u201d Aimee tucked her Kleenex back into her little satin clutch. \u201cI just converted for the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my mom is the Catholic,\u201d Carrie interjected. Matt was her older brother, one of five\u2014Carrie was the lone girl, and her very strict, Catholic mother had no idea her only daughter was a lesbian. \u201cUnless it\u2019s blessed by a priest, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s happening.\u201d Aimee leaned in to the mirror, rubbing a finger under one eye, getting rid of a slight mascara smudge. \u201cI\u2019m marrying your brother and we\u2019re going to live happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s gotta live the fairy tale.\u201d Wendy grinned. \u201cDo you have something for all your superstitions? Old, new, borrowed, blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Aimee scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ve got all the bases covered.\u201d</p><p>Aimee proceeded to show Wendy how she intended to assure her happily ever after by appeasing some ridiculous superstition with handkerchiefs, jewelry and garters.</p><p>I took that opportunity to lean in and pose the question I was dying to ask.</p><p>\u201cHey, Carrie, did you happen to see... him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, doll. No sign yet.\u201d Carrie shook her head. \u201cBut you know Dale\u2014he loves to make an entrance, right?\u201d</p><p>Wendy frowned, overhearing our conversation. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t show up, who are you going to walk down the aisle with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here,\u201d Aimee insisted with far more confidence than I felt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty close to the finish line, that\u2019s all,\u201d Wendy mumbled.</p><p>\u201cDid you see my mom?\u201d Aimee asked. \u201cShe said she was going to see if it was time yet. That was twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s out there talking to Dale\u2019s dad.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the door, thinking about John\u2014Dale\u2019s father. Last night, I\u2019d spent the night at Aimee\u2019s, of course, but after we had our hair done together, we had parted ways. Aimee went back to her place, and I had gone home. The only home I had now. John had been amazing, taking me in after what I called my other life. He had taken me in because Dale loved me, but I knew John loved me too. He treated me like a daughter and I looked at him as a father. It was true, he already had a daughter\u2014but never saw her. And I had a father\u2014but I\u2019d never even seen a picture of him.</p><p>We had driven to the church together, after I straightened John\u2019s untidy tie and made sure his long, dark hair was pulled back into a neat ponytail. I remembered how we\u2019d exchanged glances\u2014he said was coming. He promised. But we didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>We\u2019d lived together, all three of us\u2014Dale, John and me\u2014in a little townhouse just outside of the Rutgers\u2019 campus, for two years. Two years of hit-and-miss Dale, but always steady, kind John. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better replacement father figure if I\u2019d dreamed him up, and I was more than grateful for the man who had taken me in like a stray puppy out of a storm.</p><p>All because Dale Diamond had chosen me.</p><p>And I had to admit, I was still head over heels for him. Just thinking about him coming through that door, his slow, sexy smile, the dark light in his eyes when he saw me, made my heart gallop like wild horses. I imagined him taking three long strides and sweeping me into his arms, kissing me so hard my lips would bruise\u2014not that I would care\u2014and whispering my name again and again, as if he wasn\u2019t quite sure I was real.</p><p>Where are you, Dale Diamond?</p><p>Outside, music began. Aimee\u2019s head came up and she turned to look toward the sound like a deer caught in headlights, eyes widening, mouth dropping open.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she whispered, and I saw her hands tremble a little as she gripped her bouquet. \u201cOh my God, you guys, I\u2019m getting married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know!\u201d We chorused, all three of us bridesmaids half-laughing, half-crying already, as we surrounded her in a sashay show of soft pink satin support. I had never seen my best friend look more beautiful or radiant\u2014and now, more nervous. We\u2019d been through everything together, and she was now about to sail through to this new, uncharted territory\u2014marriage. Living together with one person. Forever.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how it was going to change our friendship and that scared me a little, but we\u2019d been best friends since grade school. I couldn\u2019t imagine a life without Aimee. I was thrilled for her, so much in love, so healthy and lovely and happy. It really was picture perfect, a snapshot that deserved to be saved in time.</p><p>As if on cue, the photographer came in again\u2014they\u2019d done all the pre-wedding shots already\u2014carrying a big digital camera. We didn\u2019t really pay attention to him. We were too busy fussing over Aimee, her dress and veil and hair and make-up, as he started taking candids, but I knew these were memories the bride would look back on with a sort of gauzy, sweet fondness for the rest of her life.</p><p>A day made of perfection.</p><p>What more could you ask for in a wedding?</p><p>So why, I wondered, as I took a step back, watching Carrie and Wendy ready Aimee\u2019s long train, did it all make me feel so sad?</p><p>Because I want Dale.</p><p>The realization was a stab to my belly. It was true. I did want him. I wanted him and I wanted this. This together, forever, moving forward with him, starting a life. I wanted a wedding, a marriage, a start, all those things he\u2019d promised me when he got down on one knee in front of thirty-thousand people two years ago and proposed. I looked at the ring on my hand\u2014a tiny little diamond, but it meant so much. His promise. Our life together.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t have what Aimee had. Not yet. I had to wait.</p><p>And the waiting was killing me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201d Aimee\u2019s mother popped her head into the door with a stage-whisper, and I saw tears in Mrs. Wells\u2019 eyes when she saw her only daughter turn toward her in her wedding dress, Aimee\u2019s gorgeous red hair piled high, her cheeks as pink as her bridesmaids\u2019 dresses. Linda Wells was a single mom, a hard-working lawyer, smart and sharp and always well-dressed, but she turned to a puddle at the sight of her baby girl about to get married.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother and the thought made me want to cry too.</p><p>Enough, I told myself. This is Aimee\u2019s day. Get your head out of the way.</p><p>My therapist would have told me it was okay to feel the feelings, whatever they were\u2014but I couldn\u2019t, still, a lot of the time. They felt, mostly, like they didn\u2019t belong to me at all. Today they were far too close to the surface for comfort. I felt fragile and on edge and far too raw to be out in public, exposed and on display.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Mom!\u201d Aimee stretched out her hand, smiling, and Mrs.Wells came in, shutting the door behind her. They touched cheeks and held hands and there were more wet eyes and whispered words and tissue, the camera snapping away. The music outside grew louder, insistent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really time?\u201d Aimee asked, glancing around at the circle of women.</p><p>\u201cThe boys are out there,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cLine up. Wendy, Carrie. Then Sara, as maid of honor. And finally, the bride. We\u2019ll go out into the back hall and pair up before you walk down the aisle. Your father\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Aimee\u2019s father was giving her away. Her parents been divorced for years and had their issues but it was funny how a wedding broke down all those barriers. I had seen them talking earlier, two people who could barely stand to be in the same room together, clasping hands, eyes bright, talking about the child they had brought into the world twenty years ago, happy for their daughter in spite of whatever had happened in between.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s out there,\u201d Aimee whispered.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting.\u201d I nodded, thinking of Dale, who wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Was he?</p><p>I saw a stray eyelash on Aimee\u2019s cheek and instead of brushing it away, I plucked it up between thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cOh, quick Sara, make a wish!\u201d Aimee insisted. \u201cHurry!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe in fate or superstitions or any of that stuff. But Aimee did.</p> <p>Just this once, I wanted to believe too.</p><p>My senses were full of Dale, imagining him right there, bigger than life. The thought of him being out there, right now, waiting for me, brought gooseflesh up on my arms. Everything looked hazy and far away and I closed my eyes for a moment, making a wish, the one Aimee had taught me when we were kids, before opening my eyes and blowing the eyelash gently off my finger.</p><p>\u201cIt will come true,\u201d Aimee urged, looking at the door. We were both thinking about what might lay beyond it for us. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s thinking,\u201d</p><p>I knew she meant Matt, Aimee\u2019s future husband. Her very near future husband.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to think you look BEE-utiful!\u201d Carrie snorted, nudging her future sister-in-law with an elbow, dredging up an old joke\u2014the one Matt and Aimee had met over.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help laughing but Aimee gave me a quelling look so I turned my face and tried to hide my smile. Aimee was irrationally terrified of bees and had made a fool of herself in front of Matt trying to get away from one. He had, like most boys, picked it up and run with it, creating the most interesting bee puns imaginable to mercilessly tease her about it.</p> <p>Which only proved, of course, that he liked her after all. Just like their kindergartner teacher, Mrs. Stowe, had once told them.</p><p>In fact, Matt had liked her enough to marry her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d Mrs. Wells ushered us toward the door, the photographer following, camera still going. There were two more photographers in the church, along with a video camera. Aimee wasn\u2019t missing a moment of the day.</p><p>My heart dropped when I got to the door and saw the guys in their tuxes in the hallway with their matching pink cummerbunds\u2014two of Matt\u2019s brothers. No Dale. It was time and he wasn\u2019t here. The music swelled. I could feel the church, full and warm, the congregation restless, waiting for the show to begin. My belly fluttered, excited, nervous. But there was a hollow space there, a holding cell, something missing.</p><p>Dale, where are you?</p><p>Aimee\u2019s father took her arm, whispering something into her ear, making her blush and smile. It was such a simple, sweet thing, and my heart felt like it was being torn from my chest. My father would never walk me down the aisle\u2014if I ever made it to one.</p><p>\u201cOh! My bouquet!\u201d I remembered\u2014I\u2019d left it sitting on the counter.</p><p>I rushed back into the room. It was quiet and still now, the bustling energy all gathered out in the hallway. My bouquet was on the counter and I grabbed it, glancing at my reflection in the mirror. It was the spot where Aimee had been standing, the bride-to-be, just moments before. My maid-of-honor dress was lovely and I smoothed it over my belly. It thankfully hid all my scars. Aimee had been very cognizant of that. Besides, Aimee had insisted there would be no half-undressed Madonnas at her wedding.</p> <p>Just long, pink, flowing dresses and a perfect June wedding day.</p><p>I had gone early that morning to the hairdresser with Aimee\u2014after a night sleeping over, of course, just like we used to before Tyler Vincent concerts. We\u2019d giggled and stayed up talking just like old times, too excited to sleep much. We\u2019ve even watched MTV, although now I was waiting to hear Dale\u2019s music, not Tyler\u2019s. It was Dale whose dark looks and deep blue eyes made me swoon. I\u2019d spent so much of my adolescence on Tyler\u2014when I looked back, it felt like a wasted life. But I knew it had served a purpose. Tyler had gotten me through some tough times. And if my obsession with rock star Tyler Vincent felt like a million years ago, it was still part of the thread of our past. And, in some ways, our future. I couldn\u2019t just forget him, but he had faded, like so many things.</p><p>Like my scars.</p><p>I twirled the blond tendrils at the sides of my face, adding a little extra curl and bounce. My face was flushed, eyes bright\u2014I looked for all the world like a happy maid-of-honor, and on the outside, that was perfect. But it was always the things hidden underneath, the darkness no one else saw, that mattered most.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d I called, turning with my bouquet in hand, putting on my brightest face.</p><p>And it was him.</p><p>Dale slipped into the room and knocked the breath from me instantly. He wore a black tux, his hair cut short now, no longer the shaggy mess it had been when I met him. I couldn\u2019t remember whose decision it had been\u2014which manager or producer or publicist\u2014but I liked the change. I could see his eyes, all that dark heat focused directly on me. It had been a month since we\u2019d been in the same room together and here he was, finally materialized in front of me like a dream.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming until he spoke.</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d Just my name, but it was in his mouth, soft and full, spoken like a little prayer.</p><p>And then he was on me, just as I\u2019d pictured it\u2014two strides and I was in his arms, swept up into his embrace, mouth crushing mine with the force of a kiss we\u2019d both been waiting for, longing for, dreaming about and remembering. It was like breathing again after being so long underwater you forgot where you were.</p><p>It was like coming home.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d I murmured against his lips, the heat of his body burning me like a brand, even through the layers of satin, far too much fabric between us. My God, I wanted him. There was a whole world waiting out there for us, a church full of people\u2014it was Aimee\u2019s day, not mine\u2014but I was so full of him in that moment I could have forgotten it all. That was what Dale Diamond did to me.</p><p>\u201cI promised.\u201d He nuzzled my neck, sending delicious shivers down my arms, actually making goose bumps. I clutched at him, flowers still in my hand, arms around his neck, unable to believe he was here, real, flesh. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ll always come for you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at his words, those sweet song lyrics he\u2019d written just for me. They were the first single on his album, just released and doing so well on the charts it was dazzling. I heard \u201cmy\u201d song on the radio twenty times a day, saw Dale on MTV more now than I\u2019d ever seen Tyler Vincent back during my dark, obsessive rock star days. And still, I craved more this man.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to come home to you,\u201d he whispered, lips burning a trail along my neck. \u201cI can\u2019t think about anything but you when you\u2019re not with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too.\u201d I moaned softly as his hands moving over my dress, all that flowing, slippery satin. I felt his desperation, his urgency, and met it, using my bouquet of flowers to draw his head in toward me to kiss him hard, giving me a strong, heady combination of sweet roses and Dale to fill my senses. Our tongues met and slid and our mouths and arms locked as we lost and found each other in the moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay you two, break it up!\u201d Carrie poked her head in, grinning. \u201cGet a room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to,\u201d Dale whispered, his hand pressed to the flat of my back, keeping me close as he turned to glance at Carrie. I could barely breathe, I wanted him so much. I tried to clear my head but Dale wouldn\u2019t let me go.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, we\u2019ve got a wedding about to start out here, remember?\u201d Wendy\u2019s head appeared next to Carrie\u2019s. She was grinning too.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I took a deep breath, putting a hand on Dale\u2019s chest and pushing him away\u2014slightly. \u201cLet\u2019s go walk down the aisle, handsome. We\u2019ll get in trouble later.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let me go so easily, bending his head to whisper into my ear, \u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d I smiled, twirling away from him in my dress. I felt lighter than air. \u201cThat\u2019s always a promise.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, following me out the door.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get you home.\u201d Dale pressed his lips to my ear and I shivered, toes curling in my matching dyed-pink heels as his mouth trailed down my exposed neck, forcing me to tilt my head sideways. His hands wandered down the satin back of the dress, stopping at the large pink bow in back, giving it a gentle tug. \u201cAnd out of this dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh, Dale.\u201d I giggled, but I didn\u2019t really mean it as he tugged harder, finding it sewn on, just for decoration.</p><p>There were bodies dancing all around us to I\u2019ll Be Loving You by New Kids on the Block. It was number one on the charts for weeks in June of 1989\u2014I\u2019d started paying close attention to the Billboard Charts again just like I had back when I was obsessed with rock star Tyler Vincent. I was hoping Dale\u2019s band, Black Diamond, was going to rock that insipid little boy band out of the lead. I Will Always Come For You had climbed the charts like a rocket and was holding at number eight.</p><p>Things were finally winding down. Dinner had been sit-down and because I was in the bridal party, I was seated with the rest of the bridesmaids, a solid row of pink. As maid of honor, I sat next to Aimee, who kept groaning and rolling her eyes during dinner because the clatter of knives rapping on champagne glasses kept interrupting the meal, signaling the bride and groom to kiss.</p><p>\u201cMy lips are going to be chapped!\u201d Aimee had protested, but she hadn\u2019t looked truly unhappy when she turned her face to Matt\u2019s.</p><p>After that, everyone mingled. The DJ played everything from Paula Abdul\u2019s Straight Up to Tone Loc\u2019s Wild Thing and Dale pulled me onto the dance floor and wouldn\u2019t let me go. Being on a dance floor with Dale Diamond was like sex and it gave us both an excuse to touch. We clung to each other during the slow songs and dirty danced our way through the fast ones, only we were far worse than Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey had been in the movie. We even dirty danced through that song\u2014The Time of My Life\u2014Dale\u2019s body propelling me around the dance floor like I was attached to him, my pelvis locked with his.</p><p>I had insisted on going over to see the cutting of the cake\u2014both because I didn\u2019t want to miss it and because I was so turned-on I thought everyone must be able to tell. I had to have a little break or Dale was going to make me come for him right there on the dance floor! So we\u2019d watched the newlyweds cut the three-tiered columned wedding cake decorated with\u2014of course\u2014pink roses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aimee had told me that Matt was planning to get her face full of cake when they fed each other bites of the first-cut piece, but she got him first, smearing it all down his chin. I had never understood that tradition, but they looked like they were enjoying themselves, licking cake off their fingers\u2014and each other.</p><p>Then it was back onto the dance floor with Dale and the endless torture of his lean, hard body against mine, the musky, masculine smell of him filling my nostrils, the sweet sound of his voice as he sang along to his song\u2014my song. They were playing it, I Will Always Come For You. My wish had come true\u2014he was here in my arms, this close\u2014yet neither of us could really do what we wanted to. The dance was just a slow, hot tease, heightening my senses and making me dizzy with lust.</p><p>The music changed and I lifted my head from Dale\u2019s shoulder in surprise.</p><p>\u201cChicken dance!\u201d Carrie exclaimed, hooking her hands under her armpits, elbows out, flapping her \u201cwings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we can sit this one out.\u201d Dale laughed, taking my hand and leading me off the floor. As more people crowded on to do the goofy, traditional chicken dance, Dale pulled me past the tables decorated with pink and white roses as centerpieces, out of the room and down a quiet hallway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I whispered although there was no one there to hear me.</p><p>Instead of answering, Dale turned and pressed me to the wall, instantly taking my breath away. His mouth coaxed mine open\u2014not that I needed much coaxing\u2014and I wrapped my arms around his neck, feeling his thigh slide snuggly between mine, a perfect fit. His hands moved over my dress with a frustrated urgency, as if fabric was something new and foreign to him, something that just shouldn\u2019t exist between the two of us. And I couldn\u2019t have agreed more.</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I gasped when he broke the kiss to trail his mouth down over my collarbone, his hands cupping my breasts through the slippery material. My nipples were so hard they hurt. I ached all over, wanting him, feeling suddenly inadequate to fill his urgent need. Dale eclipsed everything. He gave off a kind of energy everyone noticed, but when he was like this, nuzzling and rutting against me, growling things that might have been words, once, against my skin, he was like a caged animal pacing back and forth, his gaze never leaving his prey.</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone comes,\u201d I whispered, imagining one of Aimee\u2019s prim out-of-state aunts wandering down this hallway, catching me with my dress halfway up and Dale\u2019s hands roaming over my bodice.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d His words were muffled in my cleavage, his breath hot against my skin. I slid my hands through his hair, still marveling at how short it was now. He was like a different person without his ragtop shock of dark hair always falling over his eyes. Now I could see the dark heat in them when he lifted his face to mine, capturing my mouth again in a kiss that sent hot, white tingles through me, like shooting stars, traveling like lightning through my veins.</p><p>He forced me harder against the wall, reaching down and grabbing me by the hips, lifting me so our bodies were matched, even, his pelvis pressed into mine. I clasped his waist between my thighs, hanging on for dear life as if his kiss was a wild roller coaster and I the only rider. This was the energy he gave out on stage in front of thousands\u2014soon to be hundreds of thousands\u2014of people. But here, it was all for me and I drank it in like sweet liquid after a thousand mile trek across a desert.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Sara, I want you so fucking bad,\u201d he whispered against my lips. I felt how much he wanted me, in spite of all the fabric between us. \u201cCan we please just go now?\u201d</p><p>I moaned, feeling his hips shift, pressing harder, if that was even possible, between my open thighs, and almost gave in. But I glanced down the hallway and saw someone coming out of the dining room, where Aimee and Matt\u2019s reception was still going on.</p><p>\u201cAfter she throws the bouquet.\u201d I could barely get the words out\u2014he had his full weight against me, and it was alarmingly delightful.</p><p>Now it was his turn to groan. \u201cYou promise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, Matt has to throw the garter,\u201d I replied, smiling as he lifted his head, his cheeks as flushed as mine felt. I touched that sweet little dimple in his chin, remembering the very first time I\u2019d done that, and how long I\u2019d thought about doing it before it ever happened\u2014before Dale had been mine. \u201cAnd then the guy who catches it has to put it on the girl who caught the bouquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t they outlawed that tradition yet?\u201d His gaze had dipped down again to my cleavage. I wasn\u2019t outrageously blessed in that department, but the dress, and the bra underneath it, did wonders. \u201cDidn\u2019t Carrie and Wendy say it was sexist?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, remembering that conversation. Both girls had been adamant that it wasn\u2019t so much the bouquet and garter throwing part\u2014whoever caught it, according to superstition, would be the next person married\u2014it was the girl who caught the bouquet sitting in a chair in the middle of the dance floor and the guy who caught the garter sliding it higher and higher and higher up her leg while the DJ played some sort of stripper music. That last part was sexist, they insisted, and should be outlawed. Dale obviously agreed, although his reasoning wasn\u2019t quite the same, I was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cAimee insisted. It\u2019s really just harmless fun\u201d I felt him letting me go, relenting, and I planted a soft kiss on his cheek as he set me on her feet again. I clung to him anyway. I was still too dizzy to stand up straight. Dale took a deep breath, kissing the top of my head, all arranged in curls.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see if we can move them along.\u201d He took my hand and led me back down the hallway, head down, like a bull charging a matador. I stumbled after him, trying to keep up\u2014he was in an awful hurry! I was out of breath by the time we turned the corner and went back into the room.</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I laughed, tugging on the sleeve of his coat. I still couldn\u2019t get over how handsome\u2014and different\u2014he looked in a tux. \u201cSlow down!\u201d</p><p>He stopped so abruptly I almost ran into him. Then he turned and took me into his arms. The moment our eyes met, everything else melted away in a sea of white and pink around the edges of my vision. Aimee had made sure her pink and white theme carried through from the church to the hall. There was a huge display of decorative pink and white balloons behind the head table, near where they stood. Dale had teased Aimee all night that he was going to use them for dart practice.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get my hands on you in the next hour, I\u2019m going to take you right there on the head table.\u201d Dale whispered this into my ear and I felt a deep, crimson heat fill my cheeks. I laughed nervously, feeling his arms tighten around me. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Impatient.\u201d I smiled, twisting out of his arms and twirling away. Like I was any more patient? But I didn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cI\u2019ll go see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>I reached the head table, where Aimee and Matt sat, heads bowed, talking. It was such a sweet, intimate moment, I didn\u2019t want to break it up. Then I remembered Dale\u2019s whispered words and they propelled me forward.</p><p>\u201cHey, Aims.\u201d I leaned on the table in front of them. \u201cAre you guys doing the bouquet toss soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a hurry to get somewhere?\u201d Aimee looked up, raising her eyebrows, but she was grinning. She knew exactly why I\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cWell... you know...\u201d And I thought my cheeks couldn\u2019t get any more red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find the photographer.\u201d Matt stood, looking down at his bride. She looked stunning in all that white satin, her cheeks rosy from dancing. Even with her veil slightly askew\u2014the headband securing it had slipped\u2014she was just gorgeous. \u201cI think he\u2019s out there mingling and taking candids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look gorgeous,\u201d I said, voicing my thoughts as I came around the table, taking the seat Matt had vacated. The rest of the bridesmaids were out dancing to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. As always, I scanned the room for Dale. He\u2019d been waylaid by his father. John leaned his head in close to Dale so he could be heard over the music.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been making out in the hallway.\u201d Aimee reached up and straightened her veil. \u201cThis damned thing.\u201d</p><p>I gaped at her, the blush spreading down my cheeks to her throat.</p><p>\u201cWendy saw you leave.\u201d Aimee laughed, seeing the shocked expression on my face. \u201cShe peeked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I reached out to help Aimee secure her veil because no self-respecting maid of honor would let the bride walk around like that. I finally got the veil straight\u2014there were little combs with teeth that grabbed onto her hair. \u201cDid anyone else see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Aimee shrugged. \u201cBesides, who cares? Everyone\u2019s drunk and having a good time. I can\u2019t wait to get into the hot tub.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Aimee and Matt were staying at a hotel for one night. Their flight to St. Bart\u2019s left in the morning and they would be gone for a full two week honeymoon. Matt knew the boss, so he\u2019d been able to get the time off\u2014he worked at his dad\u2019s accounting firm.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you and Mr. Rockstar going to do tonight?\u201d Aimee smirked like she knew exactly what we were going to do. And she\u2019s probably right. Aimee and Matt were going to have wedding-night sex, but I thought nothing could beat homecoming sex. Every time Dale had to travel for an extended period, the sexual tension between them built up, like a pressure cooker, the temperature rising and rising until it finally burst the moment they touched again.</p><p>\u201cHe says he can\u2019t wait to get me out of this dress.\u201d I blushed at the memory of his words, meeting Aimee\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cFunny, Matt said the same thing about mine!\u201d</p><p>We both laughed, exchanging a knowing look. Aimee could practically read my mind and vice versa, we\u2019d been friends so long. I sat back in my chair, looking around the room we\u2019d planned to the last detail while we lolled around on Aimee\u2019s living room floor, eating popcorn and watching MTV. We went through hundreds of Brides magazines, cutting out the perfect centerpiece, the perfect dress, creating the perfect wedding. I couldn\u2019t believe it had actually all gone according to plan.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but think of how far we\u2019d come in the last two years. We didn\u2019t talk about it much anymore, but that last dark year of high school had impacted them both enough that graduation had to be put off. But I wasn\u2019t sorry about that, not anymore. If I hadn\u2019t attended Iselin Academy, we would never have gotten close to Carrie and Wendy. Aimee never would have met Carrie\u2019s brother, Matt.</p><p>And Sara never would have met Dale Diamond.</p><p>That was something she just couldn\u2019t imagine.</p><p>Aimee was the one who believed in fate and superstition and magic. I didn\u2019t quite believe, but I sometimes did them anyway, wishing on an eyelash or a shooting star, hoping Aimee was right and the world might really deliver things that were kind and good. I had hope because the universe or God or whatever force it was that moved the world had delivered Dale Diamond to me. For that alone, I would be forever grateful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>\u201cTime to throw your bouquet!\u201d Carrie rushed up to the table carrying a smaller version of Aimee\u2019s bouquet. Aimee\u2019s was so big and full, sitting on the table in front of her, it looked like a showpiece. \u201cI\u2019m gonna catch it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no you\u2019re not!\u201d I bolted around the table, reaching for it, but Carrie held it out of my reach. She was five inches taller than me on a day when she wasn\u2019t wearing four inch heels. All of the Green kids were tall.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Aimee laughed, swishing around the end of the table. Her train was all bustled up but she swished when she walked because there was so much fabric. \u201cGive it to me, you vultures, and line up with the rest of the girls!\u201d</p> <p>Carrie reluctantly handed over the flowers. The DJ was doing his thing, calling out, \u201cAll the single ladies onto the dance floor. It\u2019s your chance to catch the bouquet and see if you\u2019ll be the next lucky lady to catch her man!\u201d</p><p>All the girls squealed and jostled for position. I reached down and pulled off my heels, standing there in my nylons, the floor cold, but I didn\u2019t care. I tossed my shoes aside and saw Dale standing there with his dad. Dale had his arms crossed over his chest, a bemused look on his face as he watched all the drama. John just winked at me.</p><p>\u201cWatch my shoes!\u201d I pointed to them and John reached over and picked them up.</p><p>A few girls saw my strategy and started taking off their shoes too. Carrie was next to me and the taller girl didn\u2019t unstrap her four-inch heels. Hers was clearly a treetop strategy. She could see over all their heads and her arm\u2019s reach was freakishly long, probably twice mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d the DJ called.</p> <p>Girls screeched and elbowed each other in front of me. I went up on my tiptoes, trying to see and then saw my chance. I moved a little to the left, behind one of the junior bridesmaids\u2014Aimee\u2019s cousin, Lauren. She was just ten, but the important thing was, she was short and I could see over her head.</p><p>The DJ began the countdown.</p><p>\u201cOn three!\u201d he said. Aimee gave him a nod, holding the bouquet over her head and glancing back over her shoulder, looking at the gaggle of girls waiting to jump for it.</p><p>One</p><p>My heart raced. It was stupid. Just a superstition. I didn\u2019t even believe in superstitions.</p><p>Two</p> <p>It didn\u2019t mean anything if I didn\u2019t catch it. It didn\u2019t mean Dale wasn\u2019t going to marry me. And even if I did catch it, that didn\u2019t mean anything either.</p><p>Three</p><p>The bouquet sailed through the air, pink and white ribbons fluttering madly, and I could have sworn I had never wanted anything quite so badly in my life. The trajectory was skewed to my left, which was good\u2014it was away from Carrie\u2019s long arm, which stretched in front of me, barring my way. So I ducked under it, elbowing Lauren aside and grabbing the hanging ribbons, tugging the bouquet toward me.</p><p>I got it!</p><p>I had it, for a moment. The ribbons were clenched tightly in my fist and I yanked on them, realizing there was some resistance. It was Lauren. She had hold of the handle underneath. But I wasn\u2019t going to let a ten year old who had at least another decade to wait before marriage win this little tug of war.</p><p>\u201cGimme it!\u201d Lauren snarled.</p><p>\u201cNo way, kid!\u201d I growled right back, grabbing the handle underneath, above the younger girl\u2019s grip, and I yanked it free. \u201cThis is mine!\u201d</p><p>I held it up in triumph and the crowd cheered. Lauren pouted, crossing her arms over her chest, but Aimee came over to put an arm around the girl.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a long way to go before you\u2019re really ready to catch a bouquet,\u201d Aimee said with a laugh, nudging her young cousin. The girl gave her a reluctant smile. \u201cBesides, you know what happens next?\u201d</p><p>The girl shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMatt throws the garter and whoever catches it gets to put it on the girl who caught the bouquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a garter?\u201d</p><p>Aimee leaned down to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cEwww!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, aren\u2019t you glad Sara caught it instead?\u201d</p><p>It suddenly occurred to me that I was going to have to sit in the chair the DJ was unfolding in the middle of the dance floor.</p><p>Dale didn\u2019t look very happy about me catching the bouquet when I joined them, taking my shoes back from John and slipping them on.</p><p>\u201cI caught it.\u201d I held it up, triumphant, although now I felt a little sheepish, seeing that look on Dale\u2019s face. \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Dale shook his head as the girls dispersed, laughing and talking. The DJ was calling for all the single men to come out onto the dance floor. \u201cThere is no way another guy is going to...\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. His jaw clenched and unclenched as he looked out over the dance floor at the gathering of guys, like he was sizing them up, getting ready to do battle.</p><p>He looked down at his waist, reaching around and unhooking the pink cummerbund that had come with the tuxedo. All the guys in the wedding party were wearing them.</p><p>\u201cHold this.\u201d</p><p>He handed the pink band of material to his father and John took it, shaking his head.</p><p>That was the first time I realized Dale was wearing a belt\u2014his belt\u2014under his cummerbund. It was black and studded and had belonged to his father. Not John, but Dale\u2019s real father. I still couldn\u2019t believe John didn\u2019t know that Dale\u2014and Dale\u2019s sister Chrissy, who lived in Maine with her mother\u2014wasn\u2019t really his. I understood why Dale kept it a secret, but I didn\u2019t like it. If it were me, I would want to know. Sometimes I wondered if Dale might harbor the belief that if John found out, he wouldn\u2019t love his son anymore.</p><p>I knew that was impossible. John loved me, and I wasn\u2019t his real daughter. If he ever discovered the truth, I knew he would still love Dale and think of him as he always had\u2014as his son.</p><p>\u201cDale.\u201d I leaned in closer, touching his forearm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned and kissed me, crushing his lips against mine. He had me by the upper arms, holding my whole body against him and then just as quickly as it had happened, he let me go. I almost stumbled, but John was there to catch my arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d That\u2019s all he said before he turned and stalked over to the laughing, joking group of guys who were, I had just noticed, all fixated on me. Of course, because I was going to be the one sitting in that folding chair, pulling up the hemline of my dress, so one lucky gentleman could slide the white garter with the blue bow up, up, up, my leg, until...</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just Fred Flintstone to your Wilma, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Aimee laughed, joining them.</p><p>She\u2019d overheard Dale\u2019s emphatic you\u2019re mine. Aimee liked to joke that Dale would drag me around by the hair like a Neanderthal if he had his way. It wasn\u2019t like that, but it was hard to explain.</p><p>Matt and Aimee loved each other, but I\u2019d watched them as a couple for two years and realized it was different than what I had with Dale. They joked and teased each other, they held hands and Matt always kissed her goodbye and said I love you, but their energy wasn\u2019t the same as ours. Aimee and Matt\u2019s love was the tropical beach kind with sunshine and palm trees and white sand\u2014not unlike the place they\u2019d decided to honeymoon together.</p><p>Our love was more like a hurricane. Category five.</p><p>\u201cYou probably should have let the ten year old have it.\u201d John shook his head again, wearing the same bemused smile I\u2019d seen on Dale when I rushed off into trouble to catch the bouquet. \u201cThey would have cancelled the garter toss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I agreed with perfect 20/20 hindsight vision.</p><p>The DJ was getting to the counting stage. Dale was waiting. I could almost see how tense his limbs were under that tux, like he was ready to burst through the material itself. He was like a cat waiting to pounce, focused on his target but still paying full attention to his periphery\u2014and his competition.</p><p>I closed my eyes and sent up a little prayer to... whoever...</p><p>If you\u2019re up there, or out there, or wherever, whatever you are, will you please just let him catch it because... because he loves me... and he wants to protect me... and he\u2019s right, I am his. I belong, heart and soul, to Dale Diamond, for better or worse, richer or poorer, sickness and health, all those things they said in the vows today. Even if I never get to say them in a church, they\u2019re all true. I\u2019ve said them all in my heart. I am his and I don\u2019t want any other man to ever come between us again.</p><p>I opened my eyes, whispering a little, \u201cAmen,\u201d as the DJ started to count to three.</p><p>One</p><p>Dale\u2019s eyes widened, focused on the garter. Matt was very tall\u2014he played basketball in high school, all the Green boys did\u2014so it was easy to see the target.</p><p>Two</p><p>Matt waved the garter back and forth and Dale\u2019s eyes followed it like a big cat watching its prey zig zag in hopes of getting away.</p><p>Three</p><p>A sea of black suits and tuxes fell onto each other reaching for one little bit of white satin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t look.\u201d I turned and buried my head against John\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTell me when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Please, please, please, just let it be him, let it be Dale, please...</p><p>\u201cI got it!\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t Dale\u2019s voice.</p><p>My eyes flew open and I saw Steven, one of Matt\u2019s brothers, holding his fist up high in the air\u2014and he was tall, like Matt, so that fist was really high in the air. And still Dale stayed focused on his target. He jostled guys aside to get to Steven.</p><p>\u201cWe have a winner!\u201d the DJ announced. \u201cIf the little lady and the lucky man would step over to the chair please.\u201d</p><p>The chair. I looked at it, sitting alone in the middle of the dance floor as the guys started to disperse, slapping Steven on the back and making wisecracks about copping a feel and how high could he go? I took a step toward the chair, glancing over at Dale, and then looked back to the chair. It stood waiting. I felt like I was walking to the electric chair, not a little metal fold-up from the hall\u2019s basement.</p><p>\u201cCome on, don\u2019t be shy!\u201d the DJ called. Other girls pressed around me, the ones who hadn\u2019t caught the bouquet, urging me toward the chair. I took another step, looking over at Dale. He was saying something to Steven, who was so tall Steven had to lean down to hear him. Music played. Keep Your Hands to Yourself by the Georgia Satellites was apparently the song choice for copping a feel. Ironic.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d Aimee\u2019s voice, behind me. \u201cReally, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>But the crowd was gathering, this time near the chair. Everyone wanted to see the show and I was the star.</p><p>\u201cDale,\u201d I called, but it only came out as a squeak. The crowd pushed and pulled me, getting its way. I couldn\u2019t fight the momentum. I managed another, \u201cDale!\u201d louder this time, but I\u2019d lost sight of him, somewhere behind me.</p><p>Then I was sitting on the folding chair, everyone looking at me.</p><p>This isn\u2019t happening.</p><p>I closed my eyes, wishing it away. How many times had I done that? Sometimes it even worked. My mind flashed back to the last time a man touched me when I hadn\u2019t wanted him to. I had willed it away. Granted, Steven was harmless and I knew he wouldn\u2019t overstep his bounds. He was certainly nothing compared to the stepbeast. I shivered, remembering, trying to unremember everything with my words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This isn\u2019t happening. This is not happening.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop shivering like I was cold, but the room was actually warm from all the body heat and the candles on the tables.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for this?\u201d</p><p>I gasped, opening my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDale!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He grinned, holding up the garter.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother asking how. Matt\u2019s brother had obviously conceded, and the garter\u2014along with the garter-holder\u2019s responsibilities\u2014now rested with Dale. He held it up, stretching it, wiggling his eyebrows and ogling as I slid the hemline of my skirt slowly upward. Everyone was watching, laughing at Dale\u2019s antics. He pulled the garter back like a rubber band, making a show of taking aim, and let it go. It hit my chest and fell into my cleavage.</p><p>\u201cNice hit!\u201d someone called out.</p><p>\u201cNow go get it, boy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith your mouth!\u201d</p><p>Okay that was enough. I blushed and threw it back to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna play with it or are you gonna put it on her?\u201d</p><p>All the voices blended together. I couldn\u2019t differentiate one from the other. And I couldn\u2019t focus on anything but Dale on one knee in front of me. It was the proposal stance and my breath caught as he looked up at me, garter in hand. I hadn\u2019t seen him do this since the night Black Diamond won MTV\u2019s Battle of the Bands, the night our lives changed forever. It was also the night he proposed, just like this, on one knee in front of thirty thousand people, holding out a velvet box and asking me to marry him.</p><p>I was still wearing the ring. I never took it off.</p><p>Dale grabbed my left foot, sliding my shoe off, letting it clatter to the floor. He tickled my instep and I giggled, pointing my toes as he slipped the garter over my foot.</p> <p>\u201cHigher!\u201d the DJ called, encouraging the crowd\u2014not that they needed encouragement. I was starting to lean toward Wendy and Carrie\u2019s assessment of this ridiculous tradition. It was beyond sexist\u2014it bordered on obscene. Of course, Dale wasn\u2019t helping. Every time he moved the garter up when they yelled, \u201cHigher!\u201d he would lean down and plant a kiss there, first the top of my foot, then my ankle, now my shin. I was only peripherally aware of the photographer circling us, getting pictures for posterity. Great, we would forever be captured in Aimee\u2019s wedding book like this, me blushing with Dale\u2019s hand up my dress.</p><p>\u201cHigher!\u201d</p><p>Just below my knee. Could he feel me trembling? I met his eyes and saw the heat there. We would go home after this. I had promised. The look on his face told me we might not even make it to the parking lot, let alone home.</p><p>\u201cHigher!\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed my leg, just above my knee. He held my calf in one hand, cradling it as he moved his way up my thigh, inching his body between them.</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I whispered, glancing around at the overly interested crowd.</p><p>\u201cHigher! Higher! Higher!\u201d they called.</p><p>Another inch, two, three. My skirt was almost all the way up, the garter pushed up to mid-thigh.</p> <p>\u201cHigher!\u201d</p><p>His mouth on my inner thigh. Oh my god. Not here.</p><p>I closed my eyes and felt my sex clench in response, wanting him, goose flesh spreading, nipples hardening as his mouth traveled up and up.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s have a round of applause for our lucky lady and gentleman,\u201d the DJ interrupted. The crowd grumbled, but the DJ kept talking. \u201cLet\u2019s have everyone in a circle for the hokey pokey!\u201d</p><p>I looked down at Dale as kids flooded the stage, dragging their inebriated parents along. Bridesmaids grabbed their husbands or their groomsman. The floor started filling up around us.</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d Dale whispered, grabbing my hands and kissing the top of each one before standing and pulling me with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do the hokey pokey?\u201d I put my arms around his neck, standing on one foot\u2014the one that still had a shoe. The other was still on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIs it anything like hanky panky?\u201d He grinned, drawing me closer. \u201cIf it is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d A low voice behind us made me startle in Dale\u2019s arms. I turned to look, seeing a tall, bearded man who was built like a brick wall, even in a tux.</p><p>\u201cRussell, what\u2019s up?\u201d Dale held me even tighter as I turned in his arms to face the giant. I\u2019d never seen him before. \u201cSara, this is one of my... I guess, bodyguard is the best word. Russell, this is Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntroductions later.\u201d The big guy took a step toward us, grabbing Dale\u2019s arm. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Dale asked again, his brow furrowed. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving anyway,\u201d I said. \u201cJust let me get my purse and my other shoe and I have to say my goodbyes\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I heard it from across the room.</p><p>\u201cThere he is! That\u2019s Dale Diamond!\u201d</p><p>I felt Dale\u2019s muscles tense instantly and before I knew what was happening, the bodyguard, Russell, pushed us in the opposite direction. I tried to protest\u2014my purse, my other damned shoe!\u2014as I hobbled along wearing just one heel. I couldn\u2019t keep up this way. I glanced behind us, seeing a crowd of people\u2014all girls as far as I could tell, none of them dressed for a wedding. They were coming after us all right. Running after us, more like it. The girl out in front looked familiar and I even hesitated for a moment, trying to remember where I\u2019d seen her.</p><p>That\u2019s when Dale grabbed me, twisting his body down and sideways for a moment so he could pick me up in a fireman\u2019s carry. Then I was draped over his shoulders as Russell and Dale ran across the dance floor, breaking the hokey-pokey line where they were just putting their left foot in.</p><p>\u201cTo the left!\u201d Russell insisted, guiding Dale. \u201cEmergency door. I can take her if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dale turned and hit the door with his hip. I read the red letters upside down\u2014EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY ALARM WILL SOUND. And they weren\u2019t kidding. It drowned out everything, the music, even the girls screaming and chasing after them. It blared out in bursts, so we heard waves of sound.</p><p>You put your\u2014</p><p>BEEP</p><p>And shake it all about.\u2014</p><p>BEEP</p><p>\u201cUp the hill.\u201d Russell hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat. He pushed Dale to move faster, but of course he had the extra weight of me on his shoulders. \u201cLimo\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>I took huge gulps of the night air. It was cool, but not cold. I gasped as Dale jostled me, almost losing his footing.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he gasped. \u201cDamned dress shoes. Slippery. Grass is wet.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t rained, but the hall was also a golf course and they had likely had the sprinklers running.</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d I insisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft, left!\u201d Russell guided him. I heard the crackle of a walkie talkie.</p><p>\u201cDo you have the package?\u201d came through on the radio.</p><p>\u201cAll tied up with a nice pretty bow,\u201d Russell replied. I could see him far better than I could see Dale.</p><p>\u201cEver think you\u2019d be running from rabid fans?\u201d He winked at me.</p><p>\u201cI hope they don\u2019t bite.\u201d I couldn\u2019t see them in the dark but I could hear them. Had they made it through the door before it was shut? The alarm wasn\u2019t sounding anymore.</p><p>The radio crackled. \u201cThe eagle\u2019s ready to fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen-four.\u201d Russell said into the radio as they crested the hill.</p><p>I strained to see as Dale mostly slid down the wet grass in his dress shoes, taking me with him. There was a limo in the parking lot, the back door open, driver waiting. He was holding a walkie talkie.</p><p>\u201cIn!\u201d Russell insisted.</p><p>Dale had to put me down, which he did. I wobbled\u2014still wearing only one heel. He pressed me into the limo, climbing in behind.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Russell!\u201d I called, leaning over to wave to him.</p><p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work.\u201d He grinned, giving me a half-salute.</p><p>\u201cI guess this means you\u2019re really famous,\u201d I said, glancing at Dale.</p><p>That\u2019s when I saw them coming down the hill we\u2019d just traversed. How many? Fifty? At least! I turned to Dale as Russell shut the door and the limo began to pull away.</p><p>\u201cPoor Aimee!\u201d I saw them through the tinted glass. They weren\u2019t stopping. In fact, the crowd picked up speed when they saw the limo leaving.</p><p>I twisted in my seat to look out the back. Three girls were out front, calling after them, the rest bringing up the rear. One of the three looked familiar.</p><p>\u201cI think I know her.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI think she was one of Aimee\u2019s friends from high school. Laura? Something. Oh, Lisa! She was there when you played that show at the mall. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I pulled you on stage?\u201d He pulled me into his lap and I straddled him, my dress riding up.</p><p>\u201cMmm yes.\u201d I traced his full, pouty lips with my finger.</p><p>\u201cAnd almost... kissed... you...\u201d With each word he brushed his lips near mine.</p><p>\u201cAlmost!\u201d I groaned. \u201cYou were such a damned tease. So mean. Making me wait and wait...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it worth it?\u201d His lips almost, almost touching mine.</p><p>\u201cBeyond,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Then he kissed me, his mouth slowly slanting, teasing mine open for him. I surrendered completely in his arms, his kiss the only thing in the universe that mattered, now and forever. His lips were so soft and full, his tongue deliciously thrilling, sliding along my teeth, playing with my tongue.</p><p>His hands moved down my waist, my hips, following the lines and curves of my body. He caressed the outside of my thighs, my calves, still encased in nylon.</p><p>He blinked at me when we stopped for breath and asked, \u201cHey, where\u2019s your other shoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you! It\u2019s still on the dance floor! And my purse!\u201d I cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the driver call the hall,\u201d Dale shook his head, smiling. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep them for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAimee will probably hold onto them. If she\u2019s still talking to me after this,\u201d I added, sliding off his lap onto the seat beside him. He didn\u2019t want to let me go too far and pulled my legs over his as I stretched out on the bench seat.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least we gave them a good show,\u201d Dale said, sliding his hand up to locate the garter.</p><p>\u201cYou always give them a good show,\u201d I said proudly. Then I sat up, remembering, exclaiming, \u201cYour dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnows what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere I\u2019m taking you tonight.\u201d Dale smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have to work in the morning,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou can call in.\u201d Dale shrugged one shoulder, still playing with the garter on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cJosh is counting on me. We have a really big order of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now his fingers were moving higher than the garter, seeking the heat between my thighs. He rubbed me gently, his smile never wavering, his eyes locked with mine.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I swallowed and moaned softly when he rubbed me just a little bit faster. \u201cMmm...maybe I can go in late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached for me, and I went to him, arms around his neck as he kissed me back onto the seat, stretching out next to me, his thigh between mine. We kissed like we hadn\u2019t seen each other in years, desperate, longing kisses that did nothing to really put out the fire. In fact, it just added more fuel.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much, Sara,\u201d he murmured against my neck. \u201cWhen I\u2019m away from you it\u2019s like I can\u2019t take a full breath. It\u2019s like I\u2019m drowning and you\u2019re my life raft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d I cradled his head in my hand as he kissed his way down my cleavage. \u201cThere\u2019s a song in there somewhere...\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou know me too well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou missed me?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou thought about me every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery minute...\u201d He assured me with kisses all over the tops of my breasts. \u201cEvery second.\u201d</p><p>His hands were working my skirt up, up. He glanced down at his handiwork with a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got sexy damned legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d I looked down, pulling my dress up even higher to look.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I pulled my skirt up almost to my hips.</p><p>\u201cSara...\u201d There was a warning in his voice, in his eyes</p><p>\u201cCan he see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I grabbed his hand and slid it under the elastic of my pantyhose. He curled his fingers around my sex, his palm over my pubic bone, rocking gently.</p> <p>\u201cTease,\u201d he groaned as his fingers slid through the slippery seam of my sex.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I gasped, shifting my hips. \u201cOh that\u2019s so good...\u201d</p><p>I kissed him, sliding my tongue along his lips, desperate for him.</p><p>\u201cIs it going to be a long ride?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dale sighed. \u201cNot long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess this is the best we can do for now,\u201d I whispered, rubbing the heel of my hand through the thin material of his trousers, feeling him, hard and wanting me.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d He groaned, his hips rocking with my motion. \u201cOh God, this is torture.\u201d</p><p>It was\u2014the very best kind of torture. We continued to tease and torture each other to the brink of insanity, igniting that pure, animal lust that took over our bodies and minds whenever we were together.</p> <p>Then the limo pulled up to our destination and I sat up and straightened my dress, my hair, and prayed that wherever we were, it had a nice, soft bed and plenty of water.</p><p>Because we were going to need them.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>When the driver opened the door to the limo, Dale got out first, holding his hand out for me. I took it, my remaining shoe in my hand as I walked barefoot\u2014well, almost, I was wearing nylons\u2014into the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria hotel.</p><p>\u201cDale, you didn\u2019t.\u201d But of course, he had.</p><p>I had a rush of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu as we stood at the counter, checking in. We had just been talking about first times in the limo, and here we were at the Waldorf Astoria, the place he had brought me two years ago. It had been the first night we\u2019d ever spent together. Dale was recreating it, from the limo ride to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cSame room?\u201d I asked, watching Dale sign the paper the desk clerk put in front of him.</p><p>Dale just smiled and that little dimple his cheek appeared, making him look even more mischievous. He slid the paper over to the desk clerk, an older man, tall with almost white-blond hair he slicked back. He wore round wire-rimmed glasses and he peered over them at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Halloween,\u201d the desk clerk remarked.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I cocked my head at him, questioning.</p><p>\u201cI assume you\u2019re Cinderella?\u201d He pointed to the shoe in my hand.</p><p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019ve already found my Prince Charming.\u201d I laughed and hooked my arm through Dale\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI assume everything\u2019s ready?\u201d Dale inquired, slipping his wallet into his suit jacket pocket and glancing at the desk clerk.</p><p>\u201cEverything you asked for, Mr. Diamond. Have a glorious stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh we will,\u201d I agreed as Dale led me toward the elevators.</p><p>Before I\u2019d met Dale, my only experience of a hotel had actually been an old Howard Johnson\u2019s down in Florida. The owners had converted and re-named it The Lookout Motel, although I hadn\u2019t found the scenery\u2014a set of railroad tracks complete with a train that went by at 4 a.m. next to a self-serve storage facility\u2014much to look out at. I thought maybe they had meant something else, like \u201cLookout for cockroaches!\u201d and, in the case of the shower, \u201cLookout for inconsistent water temperature!\u201d</p><p>That had been before, when my mother was alive. It was the only family trip I remembered taking and, as usual, it had been spoiled by the stepbeast and his incessant drinking. They drove down from New Jersey to visit my mother\u2019s family, although there weren\u2019t many left. Her mother had been an only child, her father had just one brother, and my grandparents were both dead before I turned five. It was a cousin\u2019s wedding, which I found boring at the age of thirteen, but I was unbelievably excited at the prospect of visiting Disney World. The stepbeast had promised we could go.</p><p>Of course, he broke that promise. The night after the wedding I went to bed nearly vibrating with excitement. The next day was Disney World! When my eyes finally closed, my body having reached its peak of exhaustion, I didn\u2019t remember anything until early the next morning when I woke and found myself face to face with a mouse. It was sitting there cleaning itself right in front of my face.</p><p>Of course, I screamed. My hand jerked involuntarily, moving to shoo it away, and only succeeded in flattening it between my hand and the wall. The panicked mouse bit my thumb and tore off running along the side of the cot to the edge and then dropped down onto the television stand, disappearing behind the box.</p><p>My scream woke my mother and the stepbeast, who was very sluggish and hung-over and yelled obscenities as he tore the room apart looking for the elusive mouse. When he couldn\u2019t find it, he called me a fucking liar and said my punishment for lying\u2014he accused me of getting them up early so we could go to Disney World sooner\u2014was a trip back home. Right then. He made my mother pack while he took a shower and then made us both load the car while he checked out of The Lookout Motel.</p><p>We drove away just as the sun was coming up over the horizon. I remembered my mother saying, \u201cPete, she could get rabies. I saw the bite on her hand.\u201d The stepbeast had grunted and replied, \u201cIf she gets rabies, we\u2019ll put her down. Dumb woman\u2014there was no fucking mouse.\u201d I cried silently in the back seat, letting the tears fall onto my jumper, forehead pressed to the window. I didn\u2019t get rabies but I did get a nasty infection. And I never got to go to Disney World. That was the last Florida mouse I ever saw\u2014and it definitely hadn\u2019t been Mickey.</p><p>The Waldorf Astoria wasn\u2019t just a step up from The Lookout Motel\u2014it was more like a giant leap. Dale had begged and borrowed\u2014although he probably hadn\u2019t stolen anything\u2014to get the room for us the first time. Tonight, he just pulled out his credit card and paid. We\u2019d both come a long, long way since then.</p><p>\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d Dale nuzzled my neck as we stood waiting at the elevators.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d need more than that.\u201d I half-smiled as the elevator opened. It was empty and we stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cInflation?\u201d Dale smirked, pushing the button. It was forty-seven floors to the top.</p><p>\u201cDeep well.\u201d I put my arms around his neck. \u201cYou are the most amazing man in the whole world and I love you with all my heart, Dale Diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to get out of it.\u201d He grinned and put his arms around my waist, pulling me close and nuzzling my curls. \u201cWhat were you so lost in thought about?\u201d</p><p>I sighed and told him, knowing he wouldn\u2019t give up until I did. By the time I was finished, the elevator doors were opening.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard,\u201d Dale breathed, his arms tightening protectively around me. \u201cI hope he rots in jail for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey reduced the sentence to aggravated assault, remember?\u201d I reminded him with a little shiver. The thought of the stepbeast getting out of jail, after what he\u2019d done, haunted me, mostly at night when Dale was asleep\u2014or worse, out on the road. \u201cJust five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to remind me.\u201d He lifted my chin, searching my eyes. \u201cBut by then we\u2019ll be long gone, living in L.A. behind a fortress with an army of security guards. You\u2019ll be as guarded as the Queen of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Russell was any indication of the kind of security we\u2019re going to have...\u201d I joked. I didn\u2019t like to think about the stepbeast and his inevitable release.</p><p>\u201cHey, he got us out of there, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Dale put his foot out to keep the elevator door from closing. He pulled me with him into the hallway, taking out the key card and opening the door. Dale flipped on a light and the room came to life. It was like Dorothy stepping into the Land of Oz for the first time. Except we\u2019d been in this room before.</p><p>\u201cStrawberries and roses and champagne.\u201d I smiled., looking at the table where the goodies were all laid out. \u201cYou remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remembered.\u201d Dale took of his suit coat, loosening his tie. \u201cI may forget appointments or my times tables\u2014Mrs. Dunwitty would be ashamed of me\u2014and sometimes I even forget my own song lyrics. But I don\u2019t forget you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty unforgettable yourself, you know.\u201d I put my satin pink high heel, dyed to match my dress, on the table with the flowers and champagne. I eyed the strawberries, remembering we\u2019d left before I could even taste the wedding cake.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He grinned, untying his dress shoes and sliding them off. Now he looked a little more like the Dale I knew, in black slacks and a white button-down shirt. The pink cummerbund was gone. I couldn\u2019t remember where it was. The rental place was going to charge him for it\u2014not that it mattered.</p><p>\u201cIt was a really beautiful wedding.\u201d I sat in one of the chairs, picking up a strawberry and licking at the hardened chocolate.</p><p>\u201cIt was all right I guess.\u201d He popped the top on the champagne and turned over the champagne flutes. \u201cOurs will be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs?\u201d I raised my eyebrows in surprise.</p><p>He knew I wanted to marry him\u2014and he\u2019d proposed to me, so the feeling was mutual. But everyone from his manager to his publicist to his hairdresser said we shouldn\u2019t. Not yet. Greg, his manager, had been the most adamant, of course, followed by Jan, his publicist. They insisted on keeping me a secret. Dale\u2019s band, Black Diamond, was going to make them a hell of a lot of money, and since Dale Diamond himself pretty much was the band, the other members utterly forgettable, they focused solely on their money maker.</p><p>And they didn\u2019t want their money maker romantically attached. Because that didn\u2019t make them money. What made them money was a very sexy, very single rock and roll star who exuded so much sexual energy on stage girls passed out from screaming his name. Some of the reporters on shows like Entertainment Tonight said they hadn\u2019t seen anything like it since Elvis\u2014then they\u2019d show clips of Elvis and girls screaming and falling over. Followed by clips of Dale and girls screaming and falling over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So we\u2019d stayed engaged and postponed the actual marriage. I told him I could wait forever for him, which was true. He said he didn\u2019t want to wait but he left it up to me. And here we were, waiting.</p><p>Besides, it would have been impossible to plan a wedding. At first, I was studying at New York Studio School and Dale and Black Diamond were recording their first album. Even after I\u2019d graduated from the Studio School\u2019s one-year program and got a job, I didn\u2019t make a lot of money\u2014thankfully John was so sweet and generous, he said we could live there forever, although I still liked to contribute\u2014and Dale was now preparing with Black Diamond to go out on their first road tour as the opening act for Dark Wing. I knew we\u2019d get married eventually. I just didn\u2019t know when.</p><p>Dale handed me a champagne flute and I sipped it, the bubbles tickling my nose as I looked around the room. A glorious stay, indeed. There was a living area with a couch and television, all of it richly furnished. There was a small kitchenette too. To the right there was a bedroom with a huge mahogany canopy bed, if I remembered correctly.</p><p>\u201cA girl could get used to this.\u201d I smiled at him over my glass.</p> <p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d He put down his glass, holding his hand out to me. I gave it to him and he pulled me to standing, gathering me in his arms. \u201cI want to spoil you. I want to give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted in your whole life. I want to give you so much, you won\u2019t even be able to answer when someone asks you what you want because you\u2019ll already have it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Dale.\u201d I lifted my face to meet his eyes, feeling tears stinging mine and I blinked them back. \u201cI already have everything I want. Everything I could ever want. I have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best thing too,\u201d he breathed, leaning down to kiss me. It was like putting the key in and starting the engine to a soft purring muscle car. I felt a low rumble and that sweet anticipation before the car moves into gear. That gentle hum of just beginning, before the race even started, was the sweetest moment in the world.</p><p>\u201cTake me to bed,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Dale grabbed me around the waist, lifting me, and I clasped my arms around his neck, my legs around his waist, as he carried me into the other room. I glanced at the bed in the dimness, expecting him to put me on it, but instead he paused just inside the door, reaching for the light switch.</p> <p>The giant king-sized mahogany bed had a beautifully draped, cream colored canopy. The coverlet matched, a shiny satin or silk covering soft down. Dale let me slowly down and I squinted at the bed, not quite sure of what I was seeing. There was something on the bed, all over the bed\u2014and it was red. My first crazy thought was blood! But no. That was silly, Of course it was rose petals. Red rose petals all over the bed.</p><p>I glanced at Dale, smiling, bemused.</p><p>\u201cGo look.\u201d</p><p>I took a step closer, then another, realizing they weren\u2019t rose petals after all.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stool at the side of the bed,\u201d he said from the doorway.</p><p>I looked back at him leaning against it, my heart skipping at the delicious sight, shirt now unbuttoned and untucked, dress pants drawn low with his hands in his pockets, his belt, that studded belt, so damned sexy.</p> <p>\u201cStand on it and look down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I wrinkled my nose, confused, but I did what he asked, getting up onto the wooden stool and looking down at what I had first thought might be blood or rose petals, but were neither.</p><p>They were Skittles. Just the red ones. And they spelled out:</p><p>Sara Will You Marry Me?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hold back the tears then, remembering the first time I met Dale, when he\u2019d sauntered into my chemistry class, larger than life. He could have sat anywhere, but he\u2019d picked me. I was so embarrassed when my stomach started to growl in front of the cute new guy. I wanted to disappear. But he heard it\u2014I think the whole class heard it\u2014and instead of making fun of me, he\u2019d offered me some of his Skittles.</p><p>Looking down at the bed, I could see him in my memory, that dark mop of hair that always fell over one eye, wearing all black, including his combat boots, and that sexy, studded belt. Had I fallen instantly in love? Maybe I had, but if I had, it sure took me long enough to realize it. But I think Dale knew then. I don\u2019t know how it could be possible, but when he picked me to sit with that day, he really picked me.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember?\u201d Dale\u2019s voice, closer.</p><p>I nodded, not trusting my voice, not turning around. How could I forget? We\u2019d gotten in so much trouble that day for writing back and forth on Mr. Woodall\u2019s desk. He made us stay and clean them. It was all Dale\u2019s fault and he knew it. We didn\u2019t have much time left in class when Mr. Woodall caught us, but in that brief time, Dale had reached into his Skittles bag, lining up all the red ones and then making a peace offering.</p> <p>A red heart made out of Skittles.</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d</p><p>I sniffed, wiping at my eyes with the back of my hands, seeing them smeared with mascara, ready to tell him, of course I didn\u2019t forget, how could I possibly forget? Every minute I\u2019d ever spent with or even without him since the day he walked into my life had been about him. I lived and breathed Dale Diamond and would until the day I died.</p><p>I stepped off the stool and turned around to find him down on one knee holding a little blue box.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I really thought I might faint. I met his eyes, confused. \u201cBut... you already...\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my left hand where I wore the ring he\u2019d given me the day Black Diamond won MTV\u2019s Battle of the Bands. He\u2019d proposed on one knee, in front of a stadium full of people, giving me this engagement ring. But at the time, Dale didn\u2019t have much money. He\u2019d begged and borrowed to pay for our first night at the Waldorf Astoria, but I didn\u2019t want to ask what he\u2019d had to do to buy my engagement ring. It was a small solitaire\u2014just a quarter carat\u2014but I loved it because it was from Dale.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have something real.\u201d He held up the blue box and it dawned on me where it was from. I had overheard Aimee and some of her friends\u2014the popular kids, the ones whose parents had a lot of money\u2014talking once about married girls who would only give their husbands blowjobs as a trade-off for \u201cblue box\u201d jewelry.</p><p>The blue box was from Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>I put my palms to my cheeks to cool them as he opened the box, letting me see what was inside. The ring on my finger was nothing compared to the one Dale held. The diamond was huge. I blinked at him in shock, unable to even breathe, let alone speak.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d he asked, looking up at me with those gorgeous blue eyes. He was really asking. Like he thought it was a real question, as if I could have any other answer but...</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I cried, laughing through my tears, holding my arms out to him. He had me in them in one motion, hugging me close. \u201cDid you really think I would say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He breathed me in, his chest expanding against my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough two years. I was gone so much and you...\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, cocking his head and looking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you might not want to marry a rock star after all.\u201d His smile was small, tight. \u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d decided the fantasy was better than reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I touched his lips with my fingertips, hushing his words. \u201cNever. What in the world made you think that? You are my fantasy and my reality. I don\u2019t want anyone or anything but you. You don\u2019t need to give me everything. You are my everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to return the ring?\u201d He smirked, moving to put it in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laughed, reaching for the box. \u201cLet\u2019s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d Dale held the box up, taking the ring out with his other hand.</p><p>I looked down at the engagement ring I\u2019d been wearing for two years. It seemed as if I\u2019d been waiting forever for my life to really start. First it was finally graduating high school. Then Aimee was planning a wedding and I was at the New York Studio School and Dale had marching orders from his new record company\u2014he had to go whenever and wherever they said. I hated it\u2014but I knew, he hated it even more. Dale wasn\u2019t used to being bossed around.</p><p>And all the while, he had to keep me a secret.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost ours.\u201d Dale kissed my finger, pressing his lips to the first ring he\u2019d given me. \u201cIf we can hold on just a little longer, it will all be ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will be ours?\u201d I watched as he slid that ring off, slowly sliding the other one on.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d Then he kissed that ring too. It was surprisingly heavy.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want everything.\u201d I held my hand out for the other ring and he gave it to me. I slipped it onto the ring finger of my right hand. \u201cI just want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He grinned, standing up and tossing the now empty Tiffany ring box aside, a wide grin spreading over his face. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I warned, taking a step back, but I was too late. He pounced, pinning me to the bed. The weight of our bodies made the down under the coverlet rise up and Skittles flew everywhere. I heard them plinking on the night table beside us, saw some fly past the lamp, and felt more of them under my back.</p><p>\u201cThe Skittles!\u201d I lamented.\u201dYou forgot about the Skittles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget.\u201d Dale grinned. \u201cSome day I\u2019ll be on tour and I\u2019ll send a list to the hotel of all the things I want. Skittles will be on the list\u2014but just the red ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make some poor lackey separate out the red ones for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what rock stars are supposed to do.\u201d He picked up one of the Skittles on the mattress, popping it into his mouth and chewing. He pressed one to my lips and I accepted it, chewing thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna regret this when you\u2019re on your way to the bathroom and you step on a bunch of Skittles.\u201d I stuck my tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cI regret nothing.\u201d He leaned over and kissed me softly. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get you out of this dress. Roll over.\u201d</p><p>I laughed but complied, rolling over onto my belly. There were Skittles right there in front of me so I licked a few of them, letting them stick to my tongue so I could draw them into my mouth while Dale unzipped me. He pulled the fabric off my shoulders as I wiggled my way out of the satin like a very unsexy inchworm.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now these things.\u201d Dale frowned, plucking at the stretchy nylon of my pantyhose. \u201cWeird. They\u2019re like something out of a science fiction movie, I swear.\u201d</p><p>I giggled. \u201cThey\u2019re ruined anyway. Look at the feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing, walking on hot coals?\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cRunning from rabid fans, remember?\u201d I reached down, hooking a finger in one of the gaping holes and pulling. The material ripped and Dale\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d He grabbed the nylon in two hands and pulled. It ripped all the way up to my inner thigh. \u201cWow! Nice!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he did the other leg, so they were completely wrecked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s sexy.\u201d He ran his hands up my bare legs. The sensation of his soft palms and his rough fingers\u2014calloused from years of playing guitar\u2014caressing me sent sweet waves of pleasure through me. Dale touched me like he was playing music, listening to notes only he could hear as he kneaded my flesh in his hands. I bit my lip and whimpered, wiggling on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to wear tomorrow?\u201d I wondered as Dale rolled the elastic top of the pantyhose down, stripping me of them completely. Now I was in just panties and my bra.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you something.\u201d He kissed one knee, then the other. \u201cI missed your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of them.\u201d He flicked his tongue around my kneecap and down to the bend in my leg, making me moan. \u201cSee? You love that. I love that you love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that you know I love that.\u201d I ran a hand through his hair, soft as raven\u2019s wings.</p><p>\u201cI love that I know that you... wait...\u201d</p><p>I laughed, reaching for him. \u201cShut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s how the night really began.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>I was sore when I got up to go to the bathroom. The clock on the nightstand said it was two in the morning as I made my way back to the bed. Dale was sleeping, completely nude, one leg off the edge of the bed, his foot dangling, the other knee cocked. The sheet was tangled at his waist, just across his hips. The comforter was somewhere... oh yeah, we\u2019d taken it into the kitchen because having sex on the tile was too cold and far too hard.</p><p>But now I was cold. I went to the kitchen, seeing the remnants of the minibar on the counter. I think I was still a little drunk. My head was swimmy. I grabbed the comforter off the floor, putting it over my shoulders and wrapping it around me. I opened the little fridge and picked out one of the chocolate covered strawberries, eating it as I wandered into the living area.</p><p>I was tired but I couldn\u2019t sleep. Having Dale home again made my mind race almost as fast as my body. I missed him when he was gone, but I missed him almost as much when he was home. His focus was so often elsewhere these days. His rock star dream was really coming true. The album had been released\u2014with my cover art, I was so proud of that\u2014and the first single too. But he was right, he never really forgot me. Even when he was up on stage, singing to thousands, he was singing my song, thinking about me.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you come out here?\u201d Dale came out of the bedroom, rubbing his eyes. He\u2019d put on a pair of boxers.</p><p>\u201cHad to pee. Can\u2019t get back to sleep.\u201d I held an arm out, holding the comforter open and his eyes lit up when he saw I wasn\u2019t wearing anything. He snuggled up, grabbing the remote from the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cWonder if there\u2019s anything good on.\u201d He started flipping through channels while I played with his hair\u2014what was left of it. It was so soft. I loved how it felt under my fingertips at the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He shivered. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d I lightly traced my nails there and he shivered again. Then I spelled out the words, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, look, it\u2019s porn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blinked at the television, trying to focus. The picture was all scrambled but I could almost make out a hint of skin.</p><p>\u201cWant to watch porn?\u201d He grinned, pushing buttons on the remote.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t that show up on the bill?\u201d I gaped at him as the loud sounds of people having sex filled the room.</p> <p>\u201cThe record company\u2019s paying, remember.\u201d He cocked his head, looking at the screen. \u201cAnd they kind if expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey expect you to watch porn?\u201dI looked at the screen and saw a blonde with very large, very fake breasts doing a little striptease.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d pay for escorts too, if I wanted them,\u201d he replied casually, his hand stroking my thigh.</p><p>\u201cSo this is porn.\u201d I watched as the blonde spread her legs for the camera, spreading her labia with nails so long they were more like garden tools.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me?\u201d Dale sat up. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen porn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d My eyes widened when the blonde started putting her fingers inside. \u201cNot movies anyway... she\u2019s going to hurt herself!\u201d</p><p>Dale looked and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always thought too. Those fake tits and the bleach blond hair and those nails. Ugh.\u2019</p><p>He grabbed the remote and changed the channel.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d Now there were two women kissing, touching each other.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Nice.\u201d Dale perked up and I saw his cock tenting his boxers.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d My fingernails traced the hairline at the nape of his neck. \u201cWhat if I told you Aimee and I did that?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at me, mouth hanging open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding.\u201d I giggled. \u201cNo way. Gross. Never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d He scoffed, making a face and looking back at the girls. \u201cBut for a minute there, you got me thinking about it...\u201d</p><p>I watched the dark-haired girl spread her legs for the blonde. At least these two women were far more real. Their breasts didn\u2019t defy gravity and their nails weren\u2019t registered as deadly weapons. The blonde kissed her way down the brunette\u2019s smooth, taut belly. I ran my hands down my own, stopping at my scar.</p><p>\u201cAm I ugly?\u201d I asked, getting Dale\u2019s attention. His hand had wandered under his boxers and his attention had clearly been carried away by the image on the screen.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d he exclaimed, his gaze roaming over my body. I was uncovered, my thighs slightly open, leaning back on the couch.</p><p>\u201cMy scars, I mean.\u201d I winced, running my fingers over the raised spots. They were hard, knotted.</p><p>\u201cNo baby.\u201d He leaned over and kissed my fingers, my scar too. I wouldn\u2019t let him see me naked for months afterward. Sex always had to be with the lights off. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re so beautiful you make my heart ache from the inside out. And the best part about you is you\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at the screen, making a dismissive noise in his throat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fun, sometimes, but it\u2019s fake. You\u2019re real. You\u2019re you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like that.\u201d I nodded toward the screen.</p><p>\u201cI like watching, sure. I don\u2019t know any guy who doesn\u2019t. Any straight guy,\u201d he added. Then grinned. \u201cAnd gay guys just watch gay porn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s gay porn?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, grabbing the remote, pushing the button.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I protested. \u201cI don\u2019t want... oh. Wait.\u201d</p><p>Now the image was of a couple. They were kissing, fondling each other, getting undressed. I watched her unzip him, his cock springing free. I loved that feeling, when Dale\u2019s cock practically escaped out of his jeans into my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d Dale cocked his head, smiling.</p><p>My sex clenched. God I was so sore from him inside of me. I couldn\u2019t count how many ways or times we\u2019d had sex. The kitchen, the bathroom, the bed\u2014oh god, those damned Skittles\u2014and then the kitchen again, this time with me on the counter...</p><p>But my body responded when I watched the girl on the screen kneel and take his cock into her mouth. I could almost taste him. I licked my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked as Dale slid down between my thighs, parting them with his palms.</p><p>\u201cJust watch.\u201d</p><p>I did. Wow, I was learning a lot. I loved taking him in my mouth like that because of the way he responded. He loved being in my mouth, my hand, watching me lick the tip.</p><p>\u201cOoohhh yesss,\u201d I moaned as Dale\u2019s tongue slid up and down between my cleft. My nipples, already hard from being exposed to the air, grew even harder, the skin around them puckering.</p><p>The sound of sex filled the room. Now the man had the woman on the bed and he was licking her, just like Dale was licking me. Except she was completely bare down there except for a strip of dark hair at the time.</p><p>\u201cWould you like that,\u201d I murmured, my hand in his hair. \u201cWould you like me to shave all my hair down there for you.\u201d</p><p>He moaned against my flesh, lapping faster, pressing his tongue against the sensitive bit of flesh right up top. He knew just what I liked, the way to flick it with his tongue, tease it round and round, then toggle it back and forth like turning a light switch on and off at lightning speed.</p><p>The couple on the screen were fucking. He was inside her from behind, her breasts swaying. The camera got up close and personal, showing the slick shaft of his cock moving in and out.</p><p>I glanced down and saw Dale had slid his boxers down his hips. He fisted his cock, the head red and leaking pre-cum. I whimpered at the sight of it, wanting him.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d I whispered, reaching for him, falling far short, my hand opening and closing on the air. \u201cI want you in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Dale grabbed my hips, pulling me up, and I sighed when his mouth moved from my sex. But he moved quickly, reclining on the couch and settling my pelvis over his face. I nuzzled his crotch, taking his cock in my hand. It was thick and hard and, I noted with a strange sort of pride, bigger than the guy on screen.</p><p>Dale moaned when I took him between my lips. His pre-cum was peppery and I swallowed, using my tongue and bathing him with saliva. The sweet press of his tongue between my legs was taking me to climax like a freight train at full speed. I wasn\u2019t going to be able to stop it. I stroked him in my hand, moaning and rolling my hips, my eyes half closed as I watched the man on the screen. He pulled out of the woman and pumped his cock, once, twice, and then he was exploding, giving out a loud yell as climaxed.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I cried out, surprised by the sudden force of my orgasm. My hips bucked involuntarily and my hand grasped Dale\u2019s cock so hard the head was almost purple. Dale didn\u2019t stop, using his tongue to tease every last quiver and shudder from my body.</p><p>\u201cOh wow.\u201d I shivered on top of him. \u201cThat was... wow...\u201d</p><p>Dale slid out from under me and I collapsed onto the couch, still trying to catch my breat. He stood looking down at me, his eyes so full of lust it was almost scary. He licked his lips, then his fingers, tasting me still.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I smiled up at him, so sated and sleepy now.</p><p>He grabbed the comforter, folding and folding it, tossing it onto the wood coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He pointed. \u201cOn your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh.\u201d I got up, climbing slowly and carefully onto the coffee table, afraid it might not hold my weight, but it did.</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d Dale grabbed my hips and I gasped, looking for something to hold on to! I gripped the edges of the coffee table with my fingers, feeling his cock sliding up and down, teasing. It was the perfect height and with one, swift motion he was inside me. I cried out, biting my lip. I was sore, but oh, it hurt so good.</p><p>He went slow at first, easing himself out only half way before sliding back in. There was another couple on the screen, doing exactly what we were doing, a mirror image. Dale gripped my hips and thrust himself in deeper, using longer strokes, really driving into me now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDale!\u201d I cried, gasping for breath. \u201cOh God. Oh!\u201d</p><p>The way he did that, using all his force to take me, made me tremble all over. His thighs spread mine and the sounds of our sex mingled with the sounds coming from the television, moaning and slapping, the hot, aching sound of fucking.</p><p>\u201cSara,\u201d he panted. \u201cOh sweetheart, I\u2019m... Ohhhhh nowww!\u201d</p><p>I cried out when he came. I wasn\u2019t going to climax again, not this time, but the force of his orgasm shuddered through me as he thrust, thrust, thrust, hard, fast strokes, emptying himself into me with a force that threatened to tear me apart. I whimpered when he slid out of me, glancing back at him over my shoulder.</p> <p>His eyes were glazed, his look dreamy. He grabbed the remote, turning off the sounds of sex, almost as if it was an affront to the senses now. He helped me off the coffee table, grabbing the comforter and wrapping us both in it.</p><p>\u201cThink you can sleep now?\u201d he murmured, kissing the tip of my nose.</p><p>\u201cLike a baby.\u201d I rested my cheek against his chest.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He scooped me up like it was nothing and carried me to bed. I listened to the sound of his breathing, both of us snuggled under the covers. His hand was on my breast, his thigh over mine, claiming me, even in his sleep. I closed my eyes and decided to count blessings instead of sheep, but as my eyelids grew heavier and heavier, I realized it just wasn\u2019t possible to count that high.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>I sat straight up in bed, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. The first light of morning crept across the plush hotel carpet, not quite reaching the bed. Dale\u2019s side was empty.</p><p>\u201cFuck! Fuck! Fuck!\u201d Dale\u2019s voice, growing louder.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I croaked. My throat was dry and I was incredibly thirsty. Either I was a little hungover from the lure of last night\u2019s open bar or I was dehydrated of all bodily fluids after our wild night of homecoming sex. Probably both.</p><p>\u201cLook at this.\u201d He burst into the bedroom wearing just his boxers, tossing something on the bed. I was far too interested in him standing there shirtless\u2014how could I possibly be thinking about sex after the night before was beyond me, but I was\u2014to really pay attention. \u201cThat goddamned wedding photographer sold pictures to the paper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat paper?\u201d I grabbed it, scanning the top. It wasn\u2019t the Times\u2014they wouldn\u2019t have bothered with it. It was the New York Daily News, a complimentary copy slipped under the door by hotel staff for light breakfast reading. We weren\u2019t on the front page\u2014Dale had it opened to the entertainment section, where they\u2019d printed a fuzzy photograph\u2014me pressed against the wall, my legs wrapped around his waist like a monkey, our mouths slanted in an open mouthed kiss.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I swore, skimming the article. There were more photographs\u2014Dale sliding the garter up my leg, my dress pulled up sky high, another of the two of us dancing together, bodies pressed close. The article named me and speculated that I was the girl Dale had proposed to during the Battle of the Bands.</p><p>Dale\u2019s manager and pubicist had done everything they could to quell that incident, telling all the tabloids and teen mags we\u2019d broken it off. Reporters had never found out my name and the story had died off. Besides, whenever Dale jetted off to L.A. to do television spots or interviews, he always denied being involved. Whenever someone asked him about me, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s over. I don\u2019t like to talk about it,\u201d giving the world the impression he was a now-a single broken hearted rock star on the rebound\u2014which is just what his manager wanted everyone to think.</p><p>I hated it. It was like a knife twisted in my gut every time I heard him say it. But Dale hated it even more. I remembered the first time his manager had broached the subject, me sitting between John and Dale, sipping wine at a restaurant so fancy they had bathroom attendants. Fancy shmancy, Dale didn\u2019t let that stop him. It was the manager\u2019s fault\u2014he was like a dog with a bone, he just wouldn\u2019t let it go. He insisted I be kept a secret, hidden away.</p><p>\u201cYou can still see her, I don\u2019t care,\u201d his manager had said. \u201cBut we\u2019re telling the media you broke up. I can\u2019t sell a married young rock star to the buying public. It\u2019s not the image you\u2019re going to need to project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about my image,\u201d Dale had scoffed.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re done before you even got started.\u201d The manager had thrown his napkin on his plate, pushing away from the table. \u201cShe goes or I go. And if I go, all your dreams of fame and fortune go with me. Bye-bye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Dale had squeezed my hand under the table. I remember the manager\u2019s knowing smile. He had clearly done this before. He was anticipated the outcome like a gambler counting cards in Vegas, calm and cool, arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>He definitely hadn\u2019t expected Dale to get up and walk away from the table.</p> <p>Of course, after all the posturing and two more meetings with the manager\u2014he brought Dale\u2019s publicist along to back him up\u2014Dale had finally relented. But not before he asked me if I was okay with it, and I\u2019d lied through my teeth. It was the night before the last meeting and we were in bed. Dale tossed and turned and groaned into his pillow until finally, I just told him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let them play their little game. It\u2019s probably better the world doesn\u2019t know about me anyway. We don\u2019t want reporters hanging around outside.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget what he said.</p><p>\u201cSara, I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t live that lie. I love you and I want everyone to know it. All I want to do is play guitar and love you. That\u2019s it. If I can\u2019t have both\u2014then I choose you.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t be responsible for him not living his dream. I just couldn\u2019t. So I lied.</p><p>\u201cYou can have both. Just do what they say for now. Then when your first album goes platinum and you\u2019re selling out on tour, you\u2019ll have the leverage to say no.\u201d</p><p>He was thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019ll walk away from it all right now, Sara. I swear to God I will. All you need to do is say the word. You\u2019re more important to me than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You don\u2019t need to prove it to me,\u201d I reminded him.\u201cIf our relationship isn\u2019t strong enough to withstand this, then I guess it just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sara. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to tell you how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo show me.\u201d</p><p>And he had.</p><p>I stared at the paper in my hand while Dale picked up the phone, remembering that first concession\u2014the first of many. He got tired of fighting, after a while, and just starting giving in. At first he was adamant. He wasn\u2019t going to lie about me, so he said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about it.\u201d The manager and the publicist eventually wore him down and he started saying, \u201cWe broke up, I don\u2019t like to talk about it.\u201d Then it was his hair. He refused to cut it. They insisted. Arguments ensued. Finally, they won. By the time they got around to recording the album, I think they believed they\u2019d molded him into something soft and pliable they could bend, but they were wrong.</p><p>On the album, Dale refused to compromise. All of the songs were his\u2014and he\u2019d even insisted that I do the cover art. He\u2019d conceded on everything else, even on me, but he wouldn\u2019t compromise his dream. I loved him for that, more than he would ever know.</p><p>I put the paper face down on the bed. I didn\u2019t want to see the pictures, read the speculation.</p><p>\u201cGreg wants to meet.\u201d</p><p>Greg was his manager.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn two hours. At our house.\u201d</p><p>Our house was John\u2019s house. Dale would have to call and let him know.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d It was a big mess.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He shrugged, looking at me still curled up in bed. \u201cCheer up\u2014we\u2019ve got time to order room service. And if we hurry, we can still soap each other up in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does the rest of the world seem to disappear when I\u2019m with you?\u201d I asked, only half kidding.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am your world?\u201d Oh that smirky smile, the one that brought out that sweet little dimple.</p><p>\u201cThat must be it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll call room service. You get in the shower.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>We arrived home wearing various designer clothes from the gift shop in the hotel lobby.</p><p>They carried several designer lines, marked up of course, which meant they were so expensive none of them even had price tags. Their clientele obviously never asked and I didn\u2019t either\u2014I was too afraid. I just grabbed some Calvin Klein\u2014jeans and sweatshirts\u2014and took them back to our room so we could change. The salesman asked what room we were in as I went to hand over Dale\u2019s card, and then he waved it away and told me he would charge it to the room.</p><p>I had lugged the new clothes upstairs, barefoot in my formal bridesmaid dress. After we changed, I was careful to fold Dale\u2019s tux before putting it back into the now empty bag and Dale had laughed at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s a rental, remember?\u201d I had said, putting my dress in too, along with my one remaining shoe. I\u2019d also picked up two pairs of Nikes and two pairs of Ralph Lauren socks. I didn\u2019t even know he made socks.</p><p>Dale had put his arms around me, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, after this tour is over, we\u2019re going to be able to buy everything in that store.\u201d</p><p>The concept was so foreign to me, I couldn\u2019t quite grasp it.</p><p>When I\u2019d asked how we were going to get back home, Dale just made a phone call and there was a limo waiting to drive us when we got downstairs to the lobby.</p><p>Rutgers\u2019 full-time faculty housing was nice\u2014instead of apartments, they were townhouses all stuck together in rows. John was a professor there and he\u2019d insisted we move two years ago after everything happened with the stepbeast. He said it was because he didn\u2019t want people hounding Dale once his name was out there and the Black Diamonds were famous, and I\u2019m sure that was partially true.</p><p>Rutgers\u2019 full-time faculty housing was completely private\u2014they didn\u2019t want students bothering the professors at home. For that reason, it was near campus but technically not on it, hidden away in a little wooded cul-de-sac. You\u2019d never know it was there\u2014it didn\u2019t even have a street sign. All the mail went through the university, so while the townhouses had addresses, they weren\u2019t published or used anywhere. The only bad thing about it was we could never get pizza delivered\u2014they couldn\u2019t find the house!</p><p>I think that was the reason we\u2019d managed to keep it from the press for so long that Dale had a girlfriend\u2014me!\u2014and she was living at his house. They could have traced Dale\u2019s father\u2014they had the same last name\u2014to Rutgers, but that would be as far as they could go, unless someone directly told them John lived in faculty housing. And even then, they\u2019d have a hard time finding the townhouses.</p><p>The limo driver even passed it twice, the driveway was so hidden. Finally, he pulled up at the townhouse and we climbed out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d Dale nodded to the Porsche 911 that reminded me of a squished VW Beetle in front of the house with the license plate: SPD DMN. Speed Demon. It was like he was asking to get pulled over, but that was Greg\u2014bold, brash and in your face.</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d I carried the bag with our clothes in it up the steps. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>John and Greg were sitting at the kitchen table. I smiled at John but I didn\u2019t even acknowledge Greg as I passed them on the way to the stairs. The townhouses were built with one, two, or three bedroom units. We had the latter. John\u2019s bedroom was on the ground floor and ours was upstairs. The third bedroom, on the other side of the bathroom from ours, he used as an office.</p><p>\u201cSara!\u201d John called after me. \u201cI made cinnamon rolls!\u201d</p> <p>He knew they were my favorite.</p><p>\u201cWe ordered room service,\u201d I called back over my shoulder, seeing Dale standing there, hands in his jeans pockets. He\u2019d told me to go straight upstairs, that he would handle things with the manager. Which was fine with me. Greg Richer didn\u2019t like me and vice versa. It was always better when we weren\u2019t in the same room together.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get ready for work.\u201d I trudged up the stairs, heading into our room at the top of the stairs. I loved coming home. When Dale was gone, I spent a lot of time in our room, on the bed where we made love, smelling him on the sheets. The room was an amalgam of us\u2014my easel and paints, his guitars and sheet music.</p><p>I tossed the bag and crawled into bed, hugging my pillow and closing my eyes. I hadn\u2019t slept much the night before\u2014not that I was complaining\u2014but the moment my body hit the mattress, I realized how tired I really was.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t shut the door so I could hear them. At first it was just talking, mumbled voices, nothing clear. Then the voices got louder. And louder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck if they know!\u201d That was Dale. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry her. If I lose some crazy little girl bubblegum pop fans because they can\u2019t handle that? Well so fucking what!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this gets picked up by the teen mags, you\u2019re over before you even started, kid.\u201d</p><p>That was Greg. When Dale told me his full name for the first time, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Greg Richer. Managers, as a concept, were mind-boggling to me. They took twenty percent of an artist\u2019s income, and for what? It was Dale who had put his foot down with the record company. They had songs and tracks for him all planned out\u2014they wanted him to sing what they wanted.</p><p>Dale refused. He\u2019d been the one to negotiate with them, not Greg. In fact, Greg had insisted he concede or there would likely be no record deal at all.</p><p>But he was wrong.</p> <p>Dale had gotten what he wanted\u2014Black Diamond had recorded all of their own, original songs. I often told Dale Greg\u2019s last name was apropos because as far as I could tell, Greg got richer while Dale did all the work. But for some strange reason, a manager was considered necessary. A necessary evil, maybe.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say? Our friends were getting married. I wasn\u2019t going to skip out on them because there might be cameras around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to dry hump her in the hallway!\u201d Greg snapped. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a picture in here of you grabbing her crotch under her skirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not. I was putting on a garter. It\u2019s a tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImage is not about what happened. It\u2019s about what it looks like happened. And right here, it looks like you\u2019re grabbing her crotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my girlfriend,\u201d Dale said. \u201cSo it\u2019s out. We deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJan\u2019s got to find some way to spin this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here to lecture me or was there a point to this meeting? My fianc\u00e9 is waiting for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe record company wants to cancel the tour.\u201d</p><p>My head came up off the pillow, my heart dropping to my toes. I couldn\u2019t even imagine what Dale was feeling, hearing those words. I ran to the doorway, straining to hear.</p><p>\u201cI told you, image is everything. So you can sing, big deal. You have a pretty face and you can play the guitar and make girls go nuts. Big fucking deal. Do you know how many others there are just like you? Kids like you come and go in this business.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hear anyone then. I held my breath, trying to hear something\u2014anything!</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Roy Masters?\u201d</p><p>He was the head of Sonic House, the label that had put out Black Diamond\u2019s album. He was a gruff old man, nearly entirely bald, who smoked cigars and rasped when he talked. I had met him only once, when Dale had taken me to L.A. to show me around\u2014it had been my very first time in an airplane. Roy had gotten up from the chair behind his desk, which was no easy feat, considering he had to weigh three-hundred pounds, and peered at me, frowning.</p><p>\u201cSo this is the young lady who\u2019s giving us so much trouble?\u201d Roy mused, glancing at Dale, then back to me, where I was pressed tight against Dale\u2019s side. \u201cWell son, she looks like the good kind of trouble to me.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019d laughed and puffed on his cigar, sitting back down in his executive chair, the leather making a \u201cwhoosh\u201d sound under his weight.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the only thing standing between you and disaster, punk.\u201d Greg again. He sounded weary and I smiled. I couldn\u2019t blame him. When Dale wanted something, he was tireless and fearless in his pursuit. And breaking him down wasn\u2019t easy, although I\u2019d watched it happen over the course of the past two years, inch by inch.</p><p>\u201cThat and I\u2019ll Always Come For You just hit Billboard\u2019s number one.\u201d</p><p>Greg said it like an afterthought but his words seared through me like fire. I couldn\u2019t breathe, I was so stunned. Then I was running, bolting down the stairs, jumping the last two and tearing around the corner, heading to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNumber one? Number one!\u201d I squealed, putting my arms around Dale, who looked so stunned I nearly knocked him over. He grabbed me by the waist, meeting my eyes, and I laughed when he squeezed me tight and swung me around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI have to call the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to lay the fuck low!\u201d Greg insisted, wagging his finger at both of us. \u201cAnd you, missy, you need to be invisible. You hear me? In-fucking-visible! Don\u2019t you go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I laughed as Dale put me down. I heard his heart hammering in his chest when I rested my flushed cheek there. Greg Richer wasn\u2019t going to put a damper on this day, I wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d I stuck my tongue out at him and hugged Dale harder. \u201cHe\u2019s got the number one single!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Greg stood, running a hand through his thick, dark hair. I was sure he had it dyed because the lines around his eyes told me he was at least fifty, in spite of the spray-on tan. \u201cBut that all happened before this.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the newspaper and shook it at us.</p><p>\u201cShake the stupid paper and yell all you want, he\u2019s still number one.\u201d I grinned up at Dale and he grinned back,</p><p>\u201cIf I thought it would do any good, I\u2019d roll it up and smack you both on the nose like the naughty damned pups you are.\u201d Greg glanced over at John, who just sat quietly, sipping his coffee. \u201cJohn, can you talk any sense into these two kids of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one of them is officially mine,\u201d John reminded him over the rim of his coffee mug. It had a reprint of Munch\u2019s \u201cScream\u201d on it. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to make the other one official, since I already think of her as my daughter.\u201d</p><p>His words filled me with warmth.</p><p>\u201cIf he marries her, all this goes away!\u201d Greg exclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t you get that? Nights at the Waldorf Astoria and two hundred dollar pairs of Nikes go bye-bye!\u201d</p><p>He waggled his fingers, glaring at me. I looked down at my shoes, feeling guilty. Had they really cost two hundred dollars?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d I turned to the manager, frowning. \u201cSo the news is out now. Let\u2019s see what happens. Black Diamond is number one and the world now knows Dale Diamond has a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fianc\u00e9e,\u201d Dale countered, putting his arms around my waist from behind. I closed my hands over his.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s see what happens,\u201d I said.\u201dMaybe it won\u2019t make any difference at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you after twenty years in this business, it\u2019s going to make a very big difference, young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t cry over spilled milk,\u201d John interjected. \u201cThe horse is out of the barn, as they say. So let it run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it run?\u201d Greg put his head in his hands. \u201cListen, kid, I\u2019m on your side. Quit treating me like the damned enemy. I do what I do for a reason. You might not know what that reason is, but I always have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just afraid your gravy train is going to run dry,\u201d I countered.</p><p>Greg gave me a sharp look and then met Dale\u2019s eyes over my head.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think about what would happen to Sara if it leaked out that she\u2019s your girl\u2014fianc\u00e9e? She\u2019s going to be hounded, constantly, by the paparazzi. And they can be brutal. Once they know her name, they are going to uncover everything they can about her. And I mean everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I felt suddenly faint.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think of that, did you, sweetheart?\u201d Greg gave me a sad little smile.</p><p>\u201cFuuuuck.\u201d Dale drew the word out, arms tightening around me, resting his cheek against the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d If anything it was my fault, for nudging Matt to ask Dale to be a bridegroom, so we could walk down the aisle together, even if it wasn\u2019t my wedding. What had I been thinking? Of course it would mean they\u2019d dig into my past. They\u2019d find out about the stepbeast, about my mom. About everything.</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you both now see the gravity of the situation.\u201d Greg leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cWell what do you want me to do?\u201d I threw up my hands, exasperated. \u201cBecome a hermit and never leave the house again? Move to Taiwan? Kill myself?\u201d</p><p>Dale\u2019s arms tightened at that last.</p><p>\u201cNo of course not.\u201d Greg sighed. \u201cWell... maybe that first one... just until the tour is over...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that...\u201d Dale kissed the top of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not the best time to bring it up, but I want to bring her on tour.\u201d</p><p>The manager looked at him, aghast, and so did I.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Greg\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI forbid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone already knows, right?\u201d Dale shrugged. \u201cSo if she\u2019s on tour with me, we have round the clock protection. If she\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been fine here,\u201d I protested, glancing at John. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fine, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d John nodded. \u201cBut that was before they were focused on you. Now they have a name to go with the face. We\u2019re secluded here, but not that secluded.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou really want me to go with you?\u201d I turned in Dale\u2019s arms, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of being apart.\u201d He pressed his forehead to mine. \u201cI can\u2019t stand one more goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d That sad look in his eyes broke my heart. \u201cMy job...\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t much, but it was mine. I\u2019d finally started feeling what it was like to have my own life, a new sense of autonomy. I\u2019d finally been able to contribute to the rent\u2014well, really, I just used my money to grocery shop for the week. John refused to take my money so I snuck it in that way.</p> <p>\u201cJust think about it.\u201d Dale kissed me softly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need to think about it.\u201d Greg stood, picking his leather briefcase up off the floor. I watched as he set it flat on the table and opened the gold tabs. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not going. No girls on tour. Here\u2019s your copy of Billboard.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t resist. I ran over to pick it up, and there it was, right at the top.</p><p>I Will Always Come For You - Black Diamond</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to run. I\u2019m late for my next appointment.\u201d Greg snapped his briefcase closed. \u201cWould you two please, please stay out of trouble?\u201d</p> <p>Greg was looking at Dale, not me, so I dared to stick my tongue out. But I pulled it quickly back in when the manager glanced over at John.</p><p>\u201cPlease? We\u2019ve got a few months until the tour. Just keep them under wraps until then, eh, John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d John shrugged one shoulder in response.</p><p>He left and we all stood there looking at each other, grinning like idiots.</p><p>\u201cNumber one.\u201d Dale whispered.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I took the paper over to show him. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one dream come true.\u201d John smiled too, coming over to give Dale a hug. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, son.\u201d</p><p>That brought tears to my eyes. I think even Dale\u2019s eyes were a little shiny when they let go. John saw me tearing up and leaned over to kiss my cheek as they started to fall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Sara. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And whatever dirt they decide to dig up, it doesn\u2019t reflect on you. You understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though I didn\u2019t quite believe him. It was going to reflect on all of us and I dreaded it. I didn\u2019t want anyone else to be hurt by it, least of all Dale and John. They were the only two men I\u2019d ever felt I could really trust.</p><p>\u201cOh crap!\u201d I glanced at the clock on the microwave. \u201cI\u2019m going to be late for work!\u201d</p><p>Dale sighed as I ran over and grabbed my car keys out of the dish on the table by the door\u2014thankfully I\u2019d only been carrying a small clutch at the wedding with some tissue and a little bit of cash in it. John had taken his car to the wedding, so my keys where right where they should have been.</p><p>I ran back to give Dale another kiss, full on the lips. He folded me in, his mouth reminding me of our night together, our homecoming. I wanted him so much in that moment I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want to call in?\u201d he breathed when we parted. I stared at those sweet, pouty lips, my tummy doing slow flips as I remembered his mouth on me. Everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I groaned, pulling myself reluctantly away. \u201cI\u2019ll be home around five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpaghetti for dinner,\u201d John called.</p><p>\u201cYum!\u201d I opened the door, glancing back over my shoulder. Dale was looking after me with longing eyes. \u201cNumber one!\u201d</p><p>Then he smiled. It was slow to start, but then he was grinning, the light back in his eyes.</p><p>That was how I left him.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Everybody tells artists that art school is a waste of time. For most artists, that seems to hold true. If you\u2019re truly an artist, you\u2019ll do it because you\u2019re compelled to do it, not because it\u2019s your \u201cmajor.\u201d If you\u2019re not, it will end up as either a job or a hobby. Most artists are hacks. They sell out for the money and work in advertising where corporate executives dictate their lives, forcing them to draw happy families in front of brand new cars. The artists who end up practicing art as a hobby are usually happier but far poorer. Those are the artists you see airbrushing t-shirts at the local fair.</p><p>I went to art school because I wasn\u2019t good at anything else except drawing, but everybody was right. It was a waste of time in that it didn\u2019t prepare me to go out into the world and make a living as an artist. Art school didn\u2019t guarantee me a job or even make me more attractive to potential employers. What it did do, no one ever could have told me and I never would have expected. Art school didn\u2019t teach me how to draw\u2014art school taught me how to see.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it.\u201d Josh had a way of sneaking up on me, quiet as a cat.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d He\u2019d startled me and I had jumped, smearing some of my India ink on my board. Frowning, I worked to make my mistake look like it was meant to be there.</p><p>\u201cCustomers bring this in, and you make that?\u201d Josh picked up the picture I\u2019d been working from\u2014a little girl, just a toddler, holding onto a cat\u2019s tail. The cat glanced back at her with that haughty look only cats can give, like, \u2018Would you mind?\u2019</p><p>I studied my drawing. Silkscreen printing t-shirts was very lucrative. Josh\u2019s father had a booming business making team bowling shirts for all the local leagues for years. It was Josh who urged him to expand into making t-shirts. According to Josh, his father doubled his profits the first year, and quadrupled them the second. At first they printed mostly slogans like \u201cWhere\u2019s the Beef?\u201d\u2014copyright be damned\u2014but people began to ask for images. Basic ones were easy, the outline of a cat or dog for the local humane society for example, but when the demand for original artwork began, Josh put an ad in the local paper for a designer.</p><p>And I got the job.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like magic.\u201d Josh shook his head, looking incredulous.</p><p>People who didn\u2019t know how to draw said that a lot, as if it was some impossible feat, but it really wasn\u2019t. I heard, \u201cI can only draw stick figures\u201d a lot. What they didn\u2019t realize is they just stopped drawing at stick figures when they were about six or seven and academia pushed them into focusing more on letters and numbers. I didn\u2019t stop at stick figures. I just kept drawing. While everyone else was learning their times tables, I was drawing, learning as I went.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not magic.\u201d I smiled, putting down my brush so I could stretch. I got lost sometimes when I was drawing, forgetting everything, including things like time, or basic needs like eating or peeing. My bladder ached and my stomach growled.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear the prodigal son returned?\u201d Josh pulled up another tall swivel seat to my station. \u201cI saw you two in the paper!\u201d</p><p>It was almost six\u2014quitting time. His father, Dave\u2014his name silkscreened on the left breast pocket of his blue t-shirt, along with the name of his team, Oddballs, in the center\u2014had given his son the keys and left for his league night, bowling bag in hand.</p><p>Josh had been out sick for a week and we hadn\u2019t talked in a while. Dave started asking me to do a lot more in Josh\u2019s absence, including answering the phones and taking orders. He even started teaching me how to silkscreen. But I was glad Josh was back, because trying to keep up with my projects and do Josh\u2019s job was getting to be taxing!</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s home. Some fans crashed my friend\u2019s wedding. It was a total bummer. We barely got out alive, I swear.\u201d I shivered, remembering the gaggle of girls chasing us down. What did they think would happen if they caught us? What did they want, exactly?</p><p>That was you, not so long ago.</p><p>Well yes. I\u2019d been an obsessed fan once too. I told myself I wouldn\u2019t have chased Tyler Vincent down like a dog after a rabbit, but the truth was I probably would have. There was something about that state of mind, when fans worked themselves up into a frenzy. The star became an object, not a flesh and blood person. They became something to want, to covet, to own or possess. Dale was right\u2014I think they would have torn the flesh off him just to have a piece. Fans, when they got into a group like that, weren\u2019t in their right mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t been hounding this place for more pictures of you.\u201d Josh glanced out the window into the parking lot. The building was in a strip mall and there were always people coming and going.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they won\u2019t find me.\u201d That was my best hope. The thought of being trailed by paparazzi made me very nervous. Dale said they did it all the time in L.A. Thankfully, the one time he\u2019d taken me out there, we never had a problem. He\u2019s been careful about where we went just for that reason. Of course, back then, no one even knew we were together. I was the invisible girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s home for how long now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTil the end of the summer.\u201d I slid off my stool, taking my brush over to the sink.</p><p>I didn\u2019t advertise my relationship with Dale\u2014in fact, I hardly ever talked about him to anyone. His manager and publicist had impressed that upon me emphatically. But Dale had come in to pick me up from work once and Josh had been there, so he knew we were dating.</p><p>I had gone to high school with Josh\u2014he reminded me that we\u2019d been in the same freshman English class, although I only vaguely remembered it. He was a jock and ran with a whole other crowd. I knew the rumors about him and Holly Larson\u2014that she had a baby and gave it up for adoption. It was probably true, since Holly had gone to Iselin Academy with us. But they weren\u2019t together anymore.</p><p>Josh said a football injury his senior year kept him from playing college ball. That\u2019s why he decided to hold off on college and work with his dad at the print shop.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good news for you, huh?\u201d Josh followed me over to the sink, watching as I squeezed the brush with my fingers under the tap until the water ran clear. \u201cWhat\u2019s next for Mr. Rock Star now that the album\u2019s out? I hear that song everywhere I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hit Billboard\u2019s number one.\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the pride out of my voice as I headed back to my station to clean up. I was glad Josh was around to answer phones and take orders so I could finish this design. Dave was making t-shirts in the morning. The toddler on the t-shirt was turning eighteen and her mother had ordered t-shirts for everyone to wear at her graduation party as a gag.</p><p>\u201cWow, I had no idea.\u201d Josh took a seat on the stool again, watching as I cleaned up my station. \u201cThe big time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going on tour at the end of August.\u201d I fished my purse out from under my drawing table. \u201cOpening for Dark Wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Josh said again. It was impressive\u2014Dark Wing was huge, a classic rock band still going after their early 1970\u2019s debut. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d I sighed, slinging my purse over my shoulder and leaning my elbow on the desk. \u201cBut he wants me to go out on tour with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your job here?\u201d Josh didn\u2019t look very happy at the prospect of my leaving and I didn\u2019t blame him. When he hired me he said he\u2019d gone through three designers already who had either quit or he had to fire. You\u2019d think there would be more starving artists out there willing to draw for six bucks an hour but apparently not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cIt would be hard to just pick up and go. Then again, I miss him when he\u2019s gone, so... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m sure he\u2019s rolling in the dough by now.\u201d Josh sounded bitter. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t need this job for long anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh he hasn\u2019t seen any royalties yet. He won\u2019t for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him money up front?\u201d Josh frowned. \u201cWhat a rip-off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell he got an advance,\u201d I explained. \u201cBut he has to pay for everything out of it. Making the album, promotion, marketing, the tour, making the music video. All of that comes out of his advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should call it leftovers, not an advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more accurate.\u201d I laughed. \u201cPlus he still has to pay his manager. He gets twenty percent. And there\u2019s his publicist. I don\u2019t know how much she gets. But when everyone else is paid, then Dale gets a quarter of what\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quarter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are three other band members in Black Diamond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right.\u201d Josh sighed. \u201cMan, I thought rock stars were millionaires!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you have to be doing it longer\u2014and sell more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber one is pretty good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut the way the world works, somehow it\u2019s always the artist who gets shafted. They\u2019re the ones doing the work\u2014authors write books, musicians write and sing songs, artists paint paintings\u2014but everyone else gets the bulk of the money. It\u2019s kind of backwards if you ask me. Because without Dale\u2014there\u2019s nothing for all these people to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah but what if he sucks? I mean, obviously he doesn\u2019t. But what if the record company takes a chance and no one buys the album or goes to the concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no one makes any money. I think it\u2019s kind of a balancing act,\u201d I explained. \u201cThey\u2019ll have some artists who take off like a rocket and sell millions and some that fall flat. The ones who sell millions make up for the ones who don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo do you think you\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn tour?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI really don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess having a rock star boyfriend is kind of like being a military wife. My uncle was in the military and he got deployed for months at a time. My aunt didn\u2019t even know where he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s something.,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t have to worry about him getting shot at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s looking at the bright side.\u201d He grinned. \u201cHey, are you doing anything after work? I\u2019m starving, I was going to head over to Connie\u2019s Diner and get a bite. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI have to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right, rock star waiting and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn will have dinner waiting.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHave a good night, Josh!\u201d</p> <p>Pavlov would have been proud. My stomach growled the minute I pulled up to the townhouse and smelled John\u2019s spaghetti cooking. I looked around furtively before getting out of the car but didn\u2019t see anything unusual. There were no reporters with cameras surrounding the house. Maybe we would all be able to go on with our lives after all. People would forget about the pictures and the article, the one with the headline, \u201cDiamond Rocker Back Together With Girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I had hoped they wouldn\u2019t print my name but it was there, in black and white. Sara Wilson</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home!\u201d I announced, kicking off my shoes and dropping my purse near the door. The house was redolent with the smell of John\u2019s spaghetti sauce. I glanced into the kitchen and saw garlic bread waiting to go into the oven. The table was set. Where was everybody?</p><p>\u201cJohn?\u201d I called, stopping near his bedroom door. It was closed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the phone!\u201d His voice was muffled through the door. \u201cBe out in a few! Would you stir the sauce for me?\u201d</p><p>I did what he asked, taking a spoonful as payment of course\u2014and rather than thanking me, my stomach growled in protest\u2014more, more! Halfway up the stairs, I heard the sweet sound of Dale\u2019s guitar. My heart lifted in my chest and I bounded up the other half, throwing our door open and leaping at him.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d He barely had time to put his guitar aside before I tackled him, covering his face with kisses as we rolled on the bed. \u201cWow. I always wanted to get a dog so I could be greeted like that, but I think I like this much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoof.\u201d I panted like a dog and he laughed, sliding his hand behind my neck so he could pull me down for a real kiss. His mouth was soft and open and he tasted like honey. He had started sucking on Ricola cough drops to soothe his throat. Singers needed a lot of those, apparently. I just knew their Ricola commercial with the three Swiss leprechaun-looking fellows annoyed me to no end.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like dinner.\u201d He smiled rolling so we could be side by side. \u201cIs it ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as always,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m glad Josh is back. I actually got to draw today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh don\u2019t start. Josh is harmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe flirts with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe flirts with every girl,\u201d I said, exasperated. \u201cSo was it quiet here today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for Dad complaining about grading first year essays. He\u2019s pretty sure we\u2019re all going to be illiterate by the next century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reporters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a peep.\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we got lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids!\u201d John called up the stairs. \u201cDinner!\u201d</p><p>It was funny how he called us kids. I guessed maybe we would always be kids to him.</p><p>\u201cI love Mondays.\u201d I sighed happily, taking a seat at the table. Mondays was John\u2019s day off from teaching\u2014he had no classes on Monday, just office hours in the morning. He always cooked something delicious on Mondays. He had already put all the food on the table and poured me a glass of milk. Dale had a bottled water and John had a beer.</p><p>\u201cMost people hate Mondays.\u201d John smiled. \u201cBack to work day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday is spaghetti day.\u201d</p><p>Dale looked at me. \u201cI thought that was Wednesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Prince spaghetti day,\u201d John said. \u201cFor shame. I make my own pasta.\u201d</p><p>I nudged Dale on the table, smiling at him. I felt his hand on my knee and smiled. He gave it a gentle squeeze and a look that said, \u201cLater.\u201d It made me shiver.</p><p>\u201cSo it was quiet here all day, Dale says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for his incessant guitar playing,\u201d John joked. \u201cWhen are you gonna go out there and get a real job?\u201d John\u2019s eyes were twinkling but Dale didn\u2019t take the bait.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s funny, I thought it was quiet except for all your whining about students who didn\u2019t know the difference between there, their and they\u2019re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll sound the same to me,\u201d I said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh the humanity.\u201d John groaned. \u201cTo answer your rather obtuse question with a direct answer\u2014no reporters called today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a relief,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I did get an interesting phone call from your mother, Dale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d Dale\u2019s hand gripped my knee.</p><p>\u201cYour sister wants to come live with us.\u201d</p><p>Dale dropped his fork, staring at his father. I knew that look. My stomach knotted up tight. I\u2019d been hungry but now there was no room for food.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. She wants to go to Rutgers,\u201d Dale snapped.</p><p>\u201cShe did just graduate,\u201d John reminded him. \u201cAnd it makes the most sense, given that tuition is free since I\u2019m a professor there. You could have taken advantage of that fact too, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dale ignored that last point. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have anything to do with her. When is she coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMid-August.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust before the tour,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll be gone soon after she arrives.\u201d Dale resumed twirling his spaghetti around a fork. \u201cIt\u2019s good timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t go... on tour, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Dale didn\u2019t answer that. I knew he didn\u2019t want to consider that as an option.</p><p>\u201cAre you giving her my room?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo of course not,\u201d John replied. \u201c I\u2019ll dismantle the office, put most of it in my room or in storage. She\u2019ll have her own room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she flying?\u201d Dale asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, your mother\u2019s driving her and bringing all her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Dale put his fork down, pushing aay from the table. \u201cJust great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to finish?\u201d John asked as Dale got up.</p><p>\u201cI just lost my appetite.\u201d Dale walked out of the kitchen and started upstairs.</p><p>John sighed. \u201cI guess I should have waited to tell him until after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go upstairs too.\u201d I put my fork down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.I\u2019ll clean up.\u201d John waved me on. \u201cHe\u2019ll raid the fridge at midnight.\u201d</p><p>Of course he was right.</p><p>\u201cDale?\u201d I called, slowly opening the door to our room.</p><p>He was face down on the bed, words muffled, but I understood them anyway.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t be in the same room with them. They\u2019re just going to pretend like nothing happened. And fucking Chrissy. She knows! She knows damned well and she\u2019s going to take advantage of him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn thinks she\u2019s his daughter,\u201d I reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThinks is the optimum word there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay fine. So she isn\u2019t really his daughter.\u201d I sat next to him on the bed. \u201cWhat about me? He took me in and he loves me. He treats me like a daughter. Why would he treat Chrissy any differently\u2014even if he did know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re not the result of an affair with his best friend.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. What would John do, if he knew?</p><p>I remembered the first time I\u2019d found out Dale had a sister who lived in Maine with his estranged mother. It had been enough of a shock to discover that Tyler Vincent, the man I\u2019d worshipped from afar, whose music I listened to constantly, whose videos I stayed up late and waited for on MTV, whose movies I attended religiously on opening day, just happened to be John\u2019s best friend. They\u2019d met before Tyler became a star, back when Tyler was teaching music at the University of Maine, the same place John had been teaching English.</p><p>Then Dale had told me an even deeper secret, one John didn\u2019t know\u2014Dale and his sister, Chrissy, weren\u2019t John\u2019s biological children. His mother had been involved with Tyler twenty years ago, a torrid affair\u2014and she continued to have an affair with him, according to Dale, even though both she and Tyler remained married to other people. Dale\u2019s mother had finally asked for a divorce\u2014Dale said she was convinced Tyler was going to finally leave his wife for her, but he didn\u2019t\u2014and still, she never told John about the affair. Or the fact that his children weren\u2019t, in fact, his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the children were asked where they wanted to live, Dale had chosen John, who already had a teaching job lined up in California, and Chrissy had chosen to stay in Maine with her mother. John had no idea his wife and his best friend had betrayed him\u2014but his children knew. Dale told me Chrissy knew, although he wasn\u2019t sure how his younger sister had found out. Dale had discovered his mother\u2019s sordid secret because he\u2019d walked in on them, his mother and Tyler. She\u2019d sworn him to secrecy, but of course Dale would never tell. John was the man who raised him, and regardless of biology, was the man he would always think of as his father. He would never do anything to hurt him, and he\u2019d told me more than once, he believed telling John the truth about Tyler Vincent would kill him.</p><p>I knew Dale resented his little sister for siding with her mother. He felt it was like condoning what she did. He thought Chrissy had stayed because she thought, like her mother had believed, rich and famous Tyler Vincent would take care of them. I guess, to some extent, he did, according to Dale. But apparently that didn\u2019t extend to college tuition.</p><p>For that, Chrissy was turning to the man who had raised her, even though she knew full well he wasn\u2019t her real father. I understood why Dale felt so angry and betrayed, both by his sister\u2019s decision to stay and live in Maine with her mother\u2014Dale made it clear he\u2019d never talk to Chrissy again if that\u2019s what she chose, and I think he meant it\u2014and now her decision to come sponge off the man who had raised her, a man she\u2019d called \u201cDad,\u201d most of her life, until the truth was revealed\u2014a man she had ultimately rejected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d I put my hand on his shoulder, feeling the muscles tighten at my touch. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>I heard the phone ringing downstairs. We had one in our room but Dale had the habit of unplugging it when he was practicing.</p><p>\u201cSara!\u201d It was John, calling up the stairs. \u201cPhone for you!\u201d</p><p>For me? It had to be Aimee\u2014was she calling me from St. Bart\u2019s? I never did get a chance to talk to her after we\u2019d made our quick exit from the wedding. I braced myself, knowing she was going to be mad. I couldn\u2019t blame her. If my best friend\u2019s boyfriend was a rock star and had been the sole reason a whole bunch of crazy fans crashed my wedding, I\u2019d be mad too.</p><p>\u201cAimee?\u201d Dale watched as I scrambled for the phone, having to find the cord under discarded clothes and socks, mostly mine, so I could plug it into the end.</p> <p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d I picked up the phone, hearing that strange sort of open sound that meant John was still on the line downstairs. \u201cI got it, John, thanks.\u201d</p><p>John hung up and I waited, already feeling guilty, for Aimee to scold me for ruining her wedding.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I finally said, meeting Dale\u2019s eyes. He was watching, curious.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sara Wilson?\u201d It was a man\u2019s voice and I blinked in surprise. My first thought was, oh no, a reporter! Why hadn\u2019t John asked who was calling?</p><p>\u201cYes, this is Sara,\u201d I replied cautiously.</p><p>Dale frowned and I knew he was thinking what I was thinking.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I told the man who answered\u2014was that John Diamond?\u2014I told him I was Dave. From the t-shirt shop.\u201d</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t Dave from the t-shirt shop.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d I demanded. Dale was trying to grab the phone from me and I pushed him away, turning, the cord wrapping around my legs.</p><p>It had to be a reporter. Who else?</p><p>\u201cThis is...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cWell, this is your father.\u201d</p><p>I dropped the receiver to the floor like it was on fire.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cSara, listen to me.\u201d Dale reached across the table and took my hand. It was clammy and trembling but I didn\u2019t pull it away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d I was listening. But my eyes were on the door. Every time the little bell over it rang I jumped.</p><p>\u201cI know this man says he\u2019s your father,\u201d Dale began.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. This again? When the man on the other end of the phone said he was my father, the image of the stepbeast, the only father I\u2019d ever known, rose up to tower over me. My father, my real, biological father, was dead. That\u2019s what my mother always told me.</p><p>\u201cDale, come on.\u201d I met his eyes briefly over the scones we\u2019d ordered. I loved Cuppa Joe\u2019s hot chocolate. Dale was drinking coffee\u2014black. \u201cHe passed every test I could think of. He knew the hospital I was born in. He knew my mother\u2019s maiden name. He knew her middle name. He knew my middle name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll things he could have looked up in public record,\u201d he reminded me. I glared at him. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not trying to be the bad guy here. Really, I\u2019m not. But this guy shows up the day after your picture is in the paper connected to me? Everyone knows rock stars are millionaires, right?\u201d</p><p>I regretted telling him about my conversation with Josh. But I always told him everything.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know about my birthmark?\u201d I had tears in my eyes imagining my father\u2014my real father\u2014holding me as a tiny baby, kissing the dark question-mark on my right shoulder. \u201cEverything he says rings true. He\u2019s from Florida. That\u2019s where my mother\u2019s family is. He knew everything about her I could think of to ask, at least from when she was younger. He even knew my grandmother\u2019s middle name. Even I had to look that up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow he knows too much instead of not enough?\u201d I had been holding back tears but now they slipped down my face.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d Dale wiped my tears. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m here for you, no matter what. It\u2019s me. Dale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201dHe sighed. \u201cI should probably just shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems like a pretty weird coincidence that he happened to be in New York, saw your name in the paper, wondered if you might be the same Sara Wilson and decided to try to find you. And how did he find you, considering we had a whole city full of reporters who were trying and they failed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I told you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cHe said he tried finding me but I wasn\u2019t listed. So he looked up you\u2014and found out John taught at Rutgers. He said after that it was easy because so much of John\u2019s information was public. He called up USC in California where he worked before you moved here. He talked to some professor... Lane Murdoch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah he and my dad were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when he called Rutgers looking for John, he found out about faculty housing and knew that was a dead end. He tried calling the university and asking for John. He got John\u2019s assistant, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he pretended to be this Lane Murdoch fellow, said he would be in NY on a layover for just a few hours and wanted to see him. Could he possibly have his home number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she gave it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe said... he said he charmed her into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Dale replied. \u201cAnd what did he say when you first talked to him on the phone? Who did he tell your dad he was?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cDave... from the print shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did he know you worked there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like it.\u201d Dale said. \u201cIt feels wrong to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything involving me and another man feels wrong to you,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to be rational,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cFine, why don\u2019t I just tell him up front I\u2019m going to require a blood sample, so we can do some DNA testing?\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThose take weeks. By the time we had the results, if he is what I think he is, he\u2019ll be long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible.\u201d I felt the corners of my mouth twitching, ready to smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re incredibly sweet and trusting and I love you.\u201d He leaned over and kissed me. \u201cBut maybe you should ask for that blood test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I punched his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDamn, remind me not to get in the ring with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God that\u2019s him.\u201d My mouth went instantly dry. I couldn\u2019t even swallow. He was tall and lean, wearing khakis and a button-down light blue chambray shirt, just like he said he would be. He had short, sandy blond hair, not quite a military cut but close. I searched his face for any resemblance as he scanned the room, hesitating in the doorway.</p><p>His gaze skipped over me to Dale and then back to me. Our eyes met and he smiled, lifting his hand in a wave. I waved back, hoping I didn\u2019t look overeager. I felt overeager and had for weeks. I\u2019d been ready to get in my car and drive to LaGuardia, where he first called me from. He was heading back to Florida\u2014he\u2019d only been in New York for a few days on business, he said. But he promised he would be back in a month.</p><p>And here he was, keeping that promise.</p><p>He\u2019d given me his Florida phone number and we\u2019d talked on the phone several times. He assured me I could ask him anything I wanted. Dale had woken up a few times in the middle of the night to find me sitting next to the bed on the floor with a notebook and a flashlight, writing down all the things I wanted to know, things my mother had never told me. A lifetime of questions crammed into two weeks.</p><p>And now that he was here, I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He strode over to our table and Dale stood, reaching his hand out.</p><p>\u201cBenjamin Barnes.\u201d Ben shook Dale\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale Diamond.\u201d He looked over at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to take my coffee over there and let you two talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Ben\u2019s smile widened when he glanced at me and I smiled back. My cheeks hurt from smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I need to catch up on my reading.\u201d Dale held up a copy of the New York Daily News. I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d brought it along, but then I saw the picture of us that had been printed two weeks ago. He\u2019d folded it so Ben could see it clearly when he held it up. I rolled my eyes at the posturing\u2014did he really think someone would make up a story so elaborate?</p><p>Dale leaned over and his lips brushed my cheek and he whispered, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a seat,\u201d I said to Ben, nodding at the chair across from mine. I still didn\u2019t know what to call him. Ben seemed so formal and calling him \u201cDad\u201d didn\u2019t feel quite right yet either so I tried to avoid calling him anything.</p><p>Dale took a step back, letting Ben pull out the chair.</p><p>\u201cSara, I\u2019ll be right over there if you need me,\u201d Dale said again, pointing to an empty table near the window. I just nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you want something?\u201d I asked, looking down at my hot chocolate that was, by now, not hot at all. Dale had taken his coffee and scone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d Ben leaned his elbows on the table, looking at me. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Such a stupid answer, but what was I supposed to say? Dale and John had both encouraged me to go to a therapy appointment\u2014or to at least call Dr. Jarvis\u2014but I hadn\u2019t. I knew what Dr. Jarvis would ask. How does it make you feel? I was excited, nervous, anxious, confused, afraid, sad, and a little angry. The neurotic seven dwarves. But I wasn\u2019t about to tell Ben that.</p><p>\u201cHow about you?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p> <p>So we were both fine. Everything was fine. Awkward, but fine. Why could I manage to ask him a hundred questions on the phone but feel so strange and distant when we were face to face?</p><p>\u201cOh, I brought those pictures.\u201d I grabbed my purse, unzipping the top and digging through. They were in a white envelope. I put it on the table, sliding it over to him. \u201cMom had a whole box, but I just brought a few. The sample pack.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, picking up the envelope and taking out the pictures.</p><p>\u201cI tried to pick ones of me at different ages,\u201d I said, watching him study each picture and then put it down on the table when he moved on to the next.\u201cIf you really want, we can go through the whole box some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He nodded, putting another picture down on the table. Me at age three\u2014I knew, because there were three candles on the cake Mom was helping me cut. Then me as a newborn, almost completely bald. It was a black and white photo and I was propped up on a couch with pillows.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I remember you.\u201d Ben tapped that photograph, glancing up at me. \u201cAll these years I pictured you as a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I grew up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He smiled sadly. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry I missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I reached over and picked up the picture of me as a baby.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow, look at that.\u201d Ben put a picture of me and my mom on the table. I was about fourteen or fifteen. My freshman year in high school, because I recognized the painting I was holding. It had won some sort of contest. \u201cCarolyn never aged a bit, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d I agreed, looking at the two of us, her arm around me. We were like twins, blond and blue-eyed, same nose, same smile.</p> <p>\u201cAww, look at you.\u201d Ben put another photo on the table. \u201cYour first bike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d It was a white bike with a banana seat and pink streamers. I was riding toward the camera, head down, determined. I\u2019d learned late\u2014all the other kids on my block knew how to ride a bike before me. It wasn\u2019t until my mother met Pete Holmes, future stepbeast, that she could even afford to buy me a bike.</p><p>\u201cIs that your stepfather?\u201d Ben tapped the photographed. \u201cIn the background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the stepbeast,\u201d I agreed. My mother had been behind the camera. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t think they were married yet. I was in second grade when that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really did all those horrible things to you?\u201d</p><p>I leaned back in my chair, pulling up my t-shirt to expose my midriff. The doctors did the best they could, but when you have a six-inch piece of splintered door frame hammered into your side by a two-hundred and fifty pound man\u2014let\u2019s just say my days of wearing bikinis and half-shirts were over.</p><p>\u201cGood God.\u201d Ben cringed. I pulled my shirt back down. \u201cAnd Carolyn\u2019s dead? What did he do to her?\u201d</p><p>Not half as much as he did to me.</p> <p>I met his eyes and thought about telling him the rest. How the stepbeast had started coming into my room drunk in the middle of the night when I was fifteen. How I\u2019d finally worked up the courage to tell my mother two years later after I\u2019d already missed three periods, and how she\u2019d turned away, not believing me. How I\u2019d missed my last year of high school, hiding in my room, afraid of the stepbeast, and with good reason. Somehow I\u2019d known it was going to happen. The inevitable beating. The baby girl who stopped kicking inside me when I was about six months pregnant. How the stepbeast kept me locked in until all the bruises had faded before letting my mother take me to the hospital. And how she lied. And I lied too.</p><p>But how could I tell him that?</p><p>\u201cShe killed herself.\u201d I picked up the picture of me and my mother. Freshman in high school. Fourteen or fifteen. Had he started raping me yet, I wondered. \u201cI guess she just couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. What a mess.\u201d That about summed it up. \u201cSo you were left all on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Dale.\u201d I smiled, glancing over at him. He had headphones on, but he was watching us. \u201cAnd John\u2019s been like a father to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d He put all the pictures down on the table, leaning in and taking my hand. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t be there for you, I\u2019m glad you had someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re here now.\u201d I looked at him and noticed his eyes were blue, like mine. I looked so much like my mother it was hard to see if there was any of him in me. I looked down at our hands together, his swallowing mine. He had a healthy Florida tan. His watch was off-kilter and a white band of skin showed underneath.</p><p>\u201cI know this is all new to you. Me too. And I haven\u2019t asked you what you want, but...\u201d His gaze dropped to the photos on the table. \u201cI missed so much of you already. I really want to be a part of your life. But I\u2019d understand if you don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>Was he kidding? I\u2019d spent my whole life believing he was dead\u2014my mother told me he\u2019d been in a car accident. She didn\u2019t even have any pictures of him. The few times I asked, she\u2019d been very vague about the details\u2014just that they\u2019d been young and in love. Then he died while I was still a baby and she had to raise me on her own. Until the stepbeast came along. I think my mother saw him as our savior. I saw him as the antichrist.</p><p>And I spent years wishing my father was alive, wishing he could come save me. Then I\u2019d focused all that energy on Tyler Vincent, rock star, movie star\u2014the perfect man, the perfect husband, the perfect father. He had a wife and three children he publicly adored and he lavished all sorts of gifts and attention on them\u2014while I had the stepbeast and dreaded going to sleep at night. It took me a year in therapy after it all happened to realize I\u2019d just been placing all my hopes on Tyler as a replacement father. My real father was dead, my stepfather was a beast, so Tyler Vincent would have to do.</p><p>Ironic, considering how it all turned out. The more I listened to Dale\u2019s manager, Greg, talk about the music business, the more I realized how the lie of \u201cimage\u201d was created. No one in the public knew the real truth about celebrities and that was the point. To the rest of the world, Tyler Vincent was still a rock star, a movie star, the perfect man, husband and father. But Dale knew better. And so did I. Tyler Vincent was a lying philanderer. Everything about him was a lie. I was beginning to believe that was just part of being famous. People liked hearing comforting lies instead of the truth. The truth was too dark and twisted and full of demons. No one wanted to hear the truth.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He sat back in his chair. \u201cI know I have no right...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, trying to work my voice around the tears caught in my throat. \u201cI\u2019d like that. More than you could ever know. I\u2019d really, really like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so relieved.\u201d He leaned forward, smiling, and took a deep breath. \u201cBecause I have good news. I just got a job here in New York. I\u2019m moving up here next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe my ears.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve been traveling back and forth. Today was my last part of the interview process. It\u2019s not official-official yet but the manager pretty much assured me I\u2019ve got the job if I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I sat back, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cToo much, too soon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I gave a little, strangled laugh. \u201cNo, I just can\u2019t believe my luck. Every time something bad happens, it\u2019s like the universe turns it around into something good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even tell him all the things.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t missed my last year of high school, I never would have gone to Iselin Academy, where I met Dale Diamond. And even then, if my stepfather could hold down a job, I wouldn\u2019t have been hungry the day Dale walked into class and heard my stomach growling. He wouldn\u2019t have offered me Skittles and started up our conversation.</p><p>And if I hadn\u2019t been head over heels crazy-obsessed with Tyler Vincent, Dale wouldn\u2019t have offered to get me front row seats at his concert. (Of course, at the time, I had no idea Tyler Vincent was Dale\u2019s real father\u2014that didn\u2019t come out until much later. And sometimes I still wondered if Dale had picked me because he saw the \u201cI heart Tyler Vincent\u201d scribbled on my notebook. Like he saw me as a challenge. I didn\u2019t wonder about it before seeing Dr. Jarvis but I did now).</p><p>But Dale was my best thing, my most lucky thing of all.</p><p>Still, if the stepbeast hadn\u2019t lost control that day, if he hadn\u2019t beaten me and tried to kill me, I might never have moved in with John and Dale. Who knows, I might be dead. If Dale hadn\u2019t been there, I most certainly would be.</p><p>And now, that stupid photographer who sold the pictures to the paper, the pictures that threatened Dale\u2019s whole career, had brought my father\u2014my real father\u2014back into my life. My whole life was like being pushed off a cliff only to find I had a soft place to land after all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you found me.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop the tears now. \u201cNow you can walk me down the aisle and dance at my wedding. And you can be there when your first grandchild is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay now you\u2019re scaring me a little.\u201d He laughed, holding his hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I sniffed, using a napkin to wipe my face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if Dale\u2019s manager has any say in it, we\u2019ll never get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re wearing a ring.\u201d He nodded at my hand. \u201cA nice one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019ve had this one for a few weeks.\u201d I looked at the huge diamond on my left hand. Then I showed him the ring on my right hand. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had this one for two years and we\u2019re still not married. I\u2019ll believe it when the preacher says, \u2018And now you may kiss the bride.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ben glanced over at Dale. He had his combat boots on\u2014ready for battle\u2014propped up on a chair. He leaned back in it, arms crossed over his chest, headphones on, just watching us.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me much, does he?\u201d Ben asked, jerking his head toward Dale.</p><p>\u201cHe just loves me. He\u2019s very protective.\u201d I smiled at Dale but he just raised an eyebrow at me and didn\u2019t smile back. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to see me hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d Ben said, giving me a long look. \u201cAre you gonna tell him that he\u2019s going to have to be good and share his things or do I have to?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed. \u201cOnce he gets to know you, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, is Aimee back from her honeymoon yet?\u201d he asked, picking up the pictures again and leafing through them. I\u2019d mentioned Aimee in our phone conversations.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re having dinner with them tonight actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh look at this one.\u201d Ben laughed, holding up a picture to the light. \u201cYou were the most beautiful little girl. Did Carolyn put curlers in your hair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that the Shirley Temple picture?\u201d I glanced over, seeing the white lace dress and the long blonde curls. \u201cShe made me wear those curlers to bed. They were torture. Child abuse, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this where you grew up?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking at the picture. Me and a snowman in front of a little house. Back when the stepbeast only drank\u2014and beat up my mother\u2014on special occasions. I couldn\u2019t remember how many jobs he\u2019d gone through before he couldn\u2019t keep up the mortgage anymore and we\u2019d moved into the apartment complex. Of course, Dale lived in those apartments too, so perhaps it hadn\u2019t been all bad. The universe giveth, the universe taketh away.</p><p>Ben continued to sift through pictures, asking questions, genuinely interested, and I found myself unraveling more of my past for him, untangling it as I went. It took hours and we both laughed and cried a little, but it was one of the memories I would hold onto forever, kept in my mind like a sensory snapshot\u2014the smell of roasted coffee, the sweet taste of hot chocolate, the feel of my father\u2019s hand in mine, the big, roaring sound of his laugh.</p><p>And when Dale came over and told me it was time to go to dinner, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Had we really talked so long? It had gone by in a blink. I tucked the pictures back into my purse, but I let Ben keep the one he asked for\u2014the Shirley Temple snapshot. And then Ben put his big arms around me and hugged me goodbye. And for the first time in my life I called someone, \u201cDad,\u201d and meant it.</p> <p>And even when Dale insisted, I still didn\u2019t want to let him go.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t get why he didn\u2019t try to find you before now.\u201d Dale parked the car in the Olive Garden parking lot, pocketing the keys. Dale still didn\u2019t own a car so we were driving my old Dodge Dart.</p><p>\u201cWhen my mom took off, he says at first he was relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d Dale opened the door for me and I stepped in, my stomach growling. I\u2019d only had a scone and a hot chocolate all day and now I was starving. I could smell garlic and onions. I was suddenly wishing we\u2019d called ahead because all the people waiting in the lobby were standing between me and my dinner.</p><p>\u201cCome on, he was just a kid\u2014younger than us,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cWould you want to have to take care of a newborn at that age?\u201d</p> <p>Dale didn\u2019t answer. He was looking over the crowd, trying to find Aimee and Matt.</p><p>\u201cOnce he got a little older and thought about looking, he couldn\u2019t find us,\u201d I explained, hanging onto his sleeve as he weaved through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to find you pretty easy,\u201d Dale countered. \u201cTook him just one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell he agreed to the blood test,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Dale stopped, looking back at me. \u201cYou asked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d better, before you brought it up,\u201d I said, sticking out my tongue.</p><p>He snorted, taking my hand and leading me toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get why it was so hard to find you before. Didn\u2019t your mom tell her family where she was going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t see them much.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cOne of my first memories is of grandmother asking for our address so she could send me a birthday gift and my mother refusing. I was so mad at her. I just wanted my birthday present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she want them to know where she was?\u201d Dale asked, brow knitted. He was still trying to find Matt and Aimee but I was beginning to think they weren\u2019t here yet. \u201cMy grandfather used to beat her. That\u2019s what my mom told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does this not surprise me?\u201d Dale muttered. He stopped, turning around and putting his hands on my hips. \u201cWhat did Dr. Jarvis say about that when you told him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what he said.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cAnd he also said he was proud of me for breaking that abusive cycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me,\u201d he replied smugly. Then he leaned over, grabbing my ass and whispering, \u201cBecause as often as I want to spank you, I refrain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have time,\u201d I reminded him, laughing as I pulled away. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had kids yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be no spanking in our house,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cUnless it\u2019s me finally spanking you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys!\u201d I waved to Aimee and Matt. They were already here, sitting at the bar. My stomach seemed to understand that meant we would get to eat sooner and grumbled loudly.</p><p>Turned out we were twenty minutes late, which was perfect because the hostess called us before Dale and I could even find seats. The hostess seated us at a booth and the waitress came to take our drink orders. Aimee had pictures back from their honeymoon. We\u2019d already heard about how blue the water was and about the giant tortoise they\u2019d seen when they were snorkeling and how burnt Aimee got the first day because she forgot to put on sunscreen, but now we got to hear about it all over again, with visual aids.</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t get all sunburned before our wedding night,\u201d she said sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cClose enough!\u201d Matt protested. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let me touch her for three days. Three days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was beet red.\u201d Aimee sighed. \u201cI think I was redder than my hair. I made him keep going down the hall to get more ice for the bathtub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I wanted to do on my honeymoon,\u201d Matt interjected through a mouthful of breadstick.</p><p>\u201cMy mom even warned me. She put sunblock in my purse for pete\u2019s sake.\u201dAimee slapped her forehead. \u201cAnd I still forgot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were just too caught up in being Mrs. Aimee Green,\u201d I teased, taking a sip of my Diet Coke and wishing the waitress would hurry up with my Tour of Italy. I couldn\u2019t wait to eat my lasagna\u2014even if it wasn\u2019t quite as good as John\u2019s homemade.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, how did the meeting go?\u201d Aimee asked, leaning forward, all ears.</p><p>\u201cYeah, enough about our honeymoon.\u201d Matt shoved the pictures back into the envelope. \u201cUnless you want me to regale you with the tale of four times...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d Aimee blushed, nudging him with her elbow. It must have been pretty hard too because Matt coughed, spewing little bits of bread into the table. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing,\u201d Dale scoffed. \u201cOne night we\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t elbow him. I reached over and shoved a breadstick into his mouth instead. Dale bit it and chewed, giving me a doughy grin.</p><p>\u201cThe meeting was... amazing.\u201d Of course I\u2019d told Aimee about Ben\u2014it was still hard to call him \u201cmy dad,\u201d even in my head, but it was getting easier.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cSara, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold onto the happy for a while,\u201d Dale countered, washing down his bite of breadstick with my Diet Coke. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the results of blood tests or anything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh come on, Dale.\u201d Aimee raised her eyebrows at him. \u201cDo you really need to?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t explained Dale\u2019s conspiracy theory about Ben just looking for something sweet out of the deal that had nothing to do with me.</p><p>\u201cHe could be anybody. I mean, there\u2019s no father\u2019s name on her birth certificate and her mother isn\u2019t exactly around to tell us.\u201d</p><p>I winced at that and saw Aimee\u2019s look of sympathy which somehow made it worse. She still had both a mom and a dad\u2014even if they didn\u2019t get along very well, with the exception of her wedding.</p><p>\u201cIt just seems suspicious to me, that\u2019s all. Maybe I\u2019m wrong.\u201d Dale sat back in the booth, putting his arm over my shoulder. \u201cIf the DNA comes back and he\u2019s really Sara\u2019s father, I\u2019ll be the first one to welcome him to the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose tests take a long time, don\u2019t they?\u201d Matt asked.</p><p>The waitress had arrived with salad and then it was yes, cheese on the salad and yes, we need more refills and sure, bring another basket of breadsticks.</p><p>\u201cI saw a show on DNA evidence,\u201d Aimee said. \u201cIt took like a month to get the results but they\u2019re pretty conclusive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re actually starting to use it to get people out of jail,\u201d Matt remarked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was it!\u201d Aimee stabbed an olive on her plate. \u201cIt was a death row inmate and the DNA evidence proved he wasn\u2019t even at the scene of the crime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a blood test,\u201d I said softly, pushing Italian-dressing soaked lettuce around on my plate. \u201cI just know. Besides, he can answer every question I asked him. He even knew about my birthmark!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on your shoulder?\u201d Aimee raised her eyebrows. \u201cGeez, Dale. That\u2019s pretty conclusive. You\u2019re going to make the guy submit to a blood test?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d just feel better if we did one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe agreed to it right away,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s worried about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell there you go,\u201d Matt said, pointing his fork at Dale. \u201cIt\u2019s like lie detector tests. Innocent people never balk at taking them. It\u2019s the guilty ones who hem and haw and find excuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, if he\u2019s really the guy, I\u2019ll shake his hand and call him Dad myself.\u201d Dale put his olives on my plate\u2014he hated them and knew I loved them. \u201cI just... I don\u2019t want Sara\u2019s hopes dashed. She\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAww.\u201d I put my arm around him and rested my cheek against his shoulder for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re so good to me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to tell you!\u201d I sat up, looking at Dale and then over at Aimee and Matt. \u201cHe\u2019s moving here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aimee exclaimed. \u201cOh wow! For you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He had a job interview here that day he saw my picture in the paper.\u201d I laughed, shaking my head. \u201cThat\u2019s why he came back today. To finalize things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Dale stared at me.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI swear, my life is one long string of weird coincidences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Aimee snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not fate or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr God\u2019s plan,\u201d Matt offered.</p><p>\u201cMatt!\u201d Aimee elbowed him. \u201cIx-nay on the od-gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? It could be fate but it couldn\u2019t be God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit, it\u2019s all pretty weird.\u201d Aimee didn\u2019t answer her new husband. \u201cYou\u2019re obsessed with Tyler Vincent\u2014and you meet Dale Diamond, who happens to be Tyler Vincent\u2019s love child.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShh!\u201d I put my fingers to my lips. \u201cNo one\u2019s supposed to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Aimee lowered her voice. \u201cBut you fall in love with Dale, and he wins that Battle of the Bands and gets all super-famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Dale smirked. \u201cIf I was super famous we wouldn\u2019t be able to sit in an Olive Garden without interruption.\u201d</p><p>Aimee ignored him. \u201cThen that goddamned photographer\u2014by the way, Dale, you should sue him.

If you hadn\u2019t stayed after school that day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWashing desks with Dale,\u201d I reminded her.</p> <p>\u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t have gone home with Carrie and Wendy.

He was started to turn red. \u201cAnd you know, I had to get out and rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no guy can resist rescuing a damsel in distress,\u201d I weighed in.</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t let me hear the end of it, Matt!\u201d Aimee put her fork down. It clattered on her empty salad plate. \u201cOh, Aimee, sit here BEEtween me and Carrie. Oh, Aimee, I do BEElieve I see your house. Oh Aimee\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, boys only tease you because they like you,\u201d I reminded her. \u201cMrs. Stowe was right about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBEEsides.\u201d Matt leaned over and kissed her cheek. \u201cIt was that stupid BEE who brought us together.\u201d</p><p>Aimee crossed her arms, not looking at him, but I could tell she was relenting.</p> <p>\u201cYou should thank him for giving his life, because the way you jumped in my arms, girl. I was totally...\u201d Matt stopped, searching for the word, turning her face to his. \u201cBEEguiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I give up.\u201d She snorted, jerking her chin away and rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he asked you to marry him, so you were BEEtrothed.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cThe most BEEutiful bride to ever BEEcome a wife.\u201d Matt winked at me.</p><p>\u201cAwwww.\u201d I raised my eyebrows at Aimee and she grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so mean to me.\u201d She nudged him with her elbow, not so hard this time.</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d He grinned too, putting an arm over her shoulder and reaching into her lap his other hand. \u201cAnd I love you. And the little BEEn.\u201d</p><p>It took me a moment but I realized his hand was on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe little... what?\u201d Dale frowned, picking croutons out of his salad and putting them on mine.</p><p>\u201cBean? Little... bean?\u201d I sat straight up, gaping at them. \u201cAimee, are you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d Aimee elbowed him again, harder this time. \u201cI wanted to wait until after dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Matt replied as Aimee dug through her purse. \u201cThose ultrasound photos could spoil anyone\u2019s appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d She laughed, handing a slippery piece of paper over to me.</p><p>\u201cHow far along?\u201d I asked, looking at the grainy images. I couldn\u2019t see anything. I leaned over and let Dale see but he looked just as puzzled as I was.</p><p>\u201cAbout three months.\u201d She started pointing things out. \u201cThis is the face. And this is the belly. These are the legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d Matt made a face. \u201cI think she\u2019s having an alien.\u201d</p><p>Poor Matt had to get tired of that elbow.</p><p>\u201cSo you were pregnant at the wedding.\u201d My eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit.\u201d She looked sheepish. \u201cWe\u2019re telling everyone else a different date. Because you know... his mom and the whole Catholic thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019ll BEE damned.\u201d Dale sat back and looked over at me.</p><p>That made me snort Diet Coke.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings us back to God or Fate,\u201d Matt reminded us.</p><p>\u201cOr just plain coincidence,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not BEElabor the point.\u201d Aimee sighed.</p><p>We all looked at her and cracked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t do bee puns?\u201d She looked at us like we were crazy, laughing like hyenas. Then she smiled. \u201cIf you can\u2019t BEEt them, join them, right?\u201d</p><p>This time it was Dale who choked on my Diet Coke and I had to beat on his back with my fists to get him to stop. Finally, the waitress arrived with our food and I think we all must have been hungry because most of the conversation stopped except for the occasional, \u201cPass me the salt,\u201d or \u201cOh my God, you have to try this!\u201d</p><p>Dessert was tiramisu. The boys didn\u2019t order any so Aimee and I split one, both of us moaning and sighing over its pure deliciousness.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even make those sounds in bed,\u201d Matt grumbled, tossing his napkin on the table.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201d Dale laughed when I stuck a chocolate covered tongue out at him.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d I met Aimee\u2019s eyes over our dessert.</p><p>\u201cWell, you did it before I did,\u201d she reminded me. \u201cI still remember putting that stuffed bear on your belly and watching her kick it off. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAimee!\u201d Matt exclaimed, eyes wide. \u201cJeez! She doesn\u2019t want to be reminded\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Matt.\u201d I felt tears stinging my eyes but they weren\u2019t sad ones, exactly. I felt Dale\u2019s hand on my back, comforting. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to talk about her. For a long time I didn\u2019t, but Aimee was there, she knows. If we talk about her, if she\u2019s remembered, then she still lives on, in some small way.\u201d</p><p>Besides, if you believed in fate or God, then you had to believe the bad stuff had a purpose too. And while my pregnancy had come about in a truly horrific way, I never once blamed the baby I was carrying.</p><p>\u201cShe was unbelievable,\u201d Aimee said, meeting my eyes. \u201cDid the whole thing without drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t do a c-section?\u201d Matt blinked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, they induced me.\u201d I felt Dale\u2019s hand rubbing my lower back. He was closer now. He\u2019d heard this story. I leaned my head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThey said recovering from major surgery would be harder than labor,\u201d Aimee told him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. It sure looked like it hurt like hell. And she did it all without drugs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did hurt.\u201d Although I couldn\u2019t tell them, any of them, even Dale, that it hurt far less than knowing the baby I was giving birth to wouldn\u2019t ever take a breath. \u201cBut you can do it. I\u2019ll be there with you, just like you were for me.\u201d</p><p>Aimee picked up the last bit of tiramisu with her fork and put it to my lips. I took it, chewing and swallowing.</p><p>\u201cBesides, the midwife said it was so hard for me because the baby wasn\u2019t helping,\u201d I reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThe baby helps?\u201d Matt gulped his beer.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I replied. \u201cThe baby pushes with its feet and moves its head, arches its neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Dharma didn\u2019t.\u201d Aimee picked up her napkin, dabbing it at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you named her,\u201d Dale said softly.</p><p>I still had a box of her things packed away I\u2019d still never shown him\u2014the hospital bracelet they put on her, some booties, a hat. The nurses even took a lock of her hair for me\u2014fine blond fuzz. They took Polaroid pictures of me and Aimee holding her. My mother refused. She waited out in the lobby and asked, \u201cAll done?\u201d when I limped out. That\u2019s all she ever said about it.</p><p>\u201cDharma Naomi.\u201d I half-smiled at Dale\u2019s eye-roll. \u201cI know, my Tyler Vincent obsession is showing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Matt looked at me, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cTyler Vincent\u2019s oldest daughter\u2019s name is Naomi,\u201d I explained. \u201cI was pretty far gone on him at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was dessert, ladies?\u201d the waitress asked, picking up our tiramisu plate. We\u2019d done everything but lick it clean.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Aimee replied. \u201cCan you bring separate checks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, just bring one,\u201d Dale said, digging his wallet out. \u201cI\u2019m buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig spender.\u201d I made a face at him. \u201cThey paid him an advance but everything comes out of it. The recording sessions, the tour costs, everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it back on the tour.\u201d Dale handed the waitress his card. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re still number one, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Dale Diamond!\u201d The waitress looked at the card and then back to him. \u201cI\u2019ll Always Come For You is my favorite song!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can come here us live,\u201d Dale said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re going on tour at the end of August. We\u2019re opening for Dark Wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love them too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for pete\u2019s sake.\u201d I slid out of the booth, shaking my head at my rock star fianc\u00e9 who was grinning from ear to ear. He still loved being stopped for autographs. \u201cGo ahead and sign autographs. I\u2019ll meet you in the car. Come on, Aimee, let\u2019s hit the ladies room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Aimee asked when we were done using the facilities and standing at the mirror, fixing our make-up. \u201cI was really scared about telling you. I didn\u2019t want you to feel bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad?\u201d I met her eyes in the mirror. \u201cAre you kidding me? I\u2019m over the moon for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be there to hold my hand?\u201d She reached out and squeezed mine.</p><p>\u201cEvery step of the way.\u201d</p><p>Dale and Matt were waiting for us in the lobby, which had mostly cleared out. I made it all the way to the car, even waving as Aimee and Matt passed us, before I burst into tears. Dale wrapped his arms around me, stroking my hair, just letting me sob against his shirt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid,\u201d I finally sniffed. \u201cCrying over a baby that never should have been conceived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that wasn\u2019t her fault, or yours,\u201d he reminded me softly, kissing my forehead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI remember thinking about keeping her,\u201d I whispered in the dark heat of the car. Of course the stepbeast said I had to give it up. It was too late to abort the pregnancy by the time my mother told him about it. \u201cI thought if I could run away with her and start over...\u201d</p><p>I sat up, wiping my eyes. \u201cI wonder if that\u2019s what my mother did?\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands, wiping my tears with his thumbs. They just wouldn\u2019t stop falling.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d His lips met mine, my salty tears pressed between us. \u201cNone of it was your fault, Sara. Don\u2019t take it on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d I did know. Twice-weekly sessions with Dr. Jarvis had cured me of that. I didn\u2019t blame myself for it anymore, at least not like I used to. \u201cI just miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Dale held me, and it didn\u2019t occur to me until later that he never asked, \u201cWho? The baby or your mother?\u201d Because of course, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>I missed them both.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>If I had to spend one more minute with Dale\u2019s sister, one of us was going to die.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just that Chrissy used my moisturizer in the bathroom without asking and left the lid off so it got hard. It wasn\u2019t just that she left her clothes and shoes at the bottom of the stairs so I tripped over them every single time I went upstairs. It wasn\u2019t just her fashion magazines all over the living room couch\u2014I couldn\u2019t count how many times I\u2019d sat down on a Cosmo\u2014and she painted her nails in there too, leaving her nail polish and red brush marks on the coffee table.</p><p>All of those things made living with her annoying but not impossible. Even her incessant whining was tolerable if I tuned her out. It was the way she treated her father and brother that infuriated me to the point of no return. She hadn\u2019t said more than two words to me since she\u2019d arrived two weeks ago\u2014and I thought those had been, \u201cHi, Sara.\u201d She pretended I didn\u2019t exist, unless she was using me to make a point.</p><p>\u201cYou told Sara she could eat in the living room! Why can\u2019t I?\u201d She\u2019d complained to John.</p><p>\u201cBecause Sara doesn\u2019t wipe her fingers on my couch or leave her ice cream sandwich wrappers in the cushions like a two-year-old.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that didn\u2019t go over so well. John came home from his long teaching day on Tuesday\u2014that was the night I cooked dinner and I was busy in the kitchen with no clue to what she was doing in the other room\u2014to find that she\u2019d purposely opened every single ice cream sandwich in the box and left them to melt on the living room couch.</p><p>And when John called her downstairs from her room, she utterly denied it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. It was truly like we were living with a two-year-old, not a girl about to enter college. John demanded she clean it up and she called him names I didn\u2019t even know existed. Then she grabbed her purse and left the house.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s just testing me.\u201d John sighed and sank into a kitchen chair.</p><p>That\u2019s what he said when he had his new girlfriend, Debra, over to dinner one night and Chrissy threw the entire bowl of mashed potatoes on the floor because John left lumps in them. I\u2019d cleaned up the mashed potatoes\u2014just like I cleaned up the sofa. Thankfully the kitchen floor was tile and the sofa was leather. But at the end of a very long two weeks I\u2019d spent going out of my way to try to make her feel more at home (which is what John said she needed) and mediating fights between brother and sister (Dale ignored her until she got right in his face) I was getting very tired of cleaning up Chrissy\u2019s messes.</p><p>And still, I might have continued to tolerate it if they were just toddler outbursts, adult temper tantrums. But Chrissy had an axe to grind and she was shining up the blade, waiting for just the right moment to use it.</p><p>She got into her father\u2019s face, screaming at him until spittle flew from her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking coward, you know that?\u201d She would shove him with both hands, trying to provoke him. \u201cYou\u2019re a wimp. Fucking limp-dick! You couldn\u2019t keep your wife happy and she left you! You should be ashamed of yourself! I hate you! I wish you were dead!\u201d</p><p>And off she would go again, either to her room, slamming the door with such force the whole house shook, turning her heavy metal music up to deafening neighbors-likely-to-call-the-police volume, or she\u2019d head out the door, God only knows where. I was beginning to prefer the latter, because at least we were spared the noise.</p><p>The strangest part was, an hour later, she was back, sweet as could be, pretending like nothing happened. In fact, if you mentioned it, she would get teary-eyed and upset, as if she was the one who had been hurt. And John would put his arms around her and hug her and she would ask for something\u2014money to go to the mall, a leather bomber jacket, a fifty dollar pair of shoes\u2014and he would give it to her.</p><p>I had asked Dale if that\u2019s how it had always been with his sister.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He had stared up at the ceiling, arms behind his head. \u201cI mean, she was always a little spoiled. But not like this. I don\u2019t know, maybe my mother poisoned her against my dad.\u201d</p><p>It was a reasonable explanation. I\u2019d met Dale\u2019s mother when she dropped Chrissy off. We all went out to dinner at Red Lobster\u2014Chrissy\u2019s favorite\u2014and Dale\u2019s mother had done nothing but talk about how she was making a killing in the real estate market. It was the only time I\u2019d seen Chrissy be relatively quiet and behave, probably because her mother corrected her every few minutes.</p><p>Chrissy, sit up straight.</p><p>Chrissy, don\u2019t use your fingers.</p><p>Chrissy, your napkin goes in your lap.</p><p>No dessert for you, Chrissy.</p><p>I said no.</p><p>And she\u2019d say those things right in the middle of a sentence, then going on like they\u2019d never happened. It was no wonder Chrissy acted like a child. Her mother treated her like one.</p><p>It was early on a warm August Monday morning that Chrissy really crossed her brother\u2019s line. And Dale had a very long fuse, but when it reached the end, the explosion was formidable.</p><p>Dale loved sleeping with the windows open, and I liked waking up to a gentle breeze blowing the curtains over our head. I woke up first, a full half an hour before the alarm. Dale hated alarms and refused to use one. I\u2019d searched high and low for an alarm that would wake us up with gentle sounds like ocean waves or crickets so they wouldn\u2019t disturb him. And if Dale had to be up, well, I was his human alarm clock.</p><p>Today he didn\u2019t have anywhere to go\u2014the band had been practicing hard for the tour, getting together four times a week\u2014and I thought about going to take a shower and just letting him sleep, since I had appointments to keep. But he was on his back, sheet tangled around his waist, one arm thrown over his head, the other resting on his chest, looking so tantalizing\u2014and I did have an extra half hour.</p><p>I loved watching him sleep. He was so sweet and peaceful, his mouth slightly open, the first peek of the sun on the horizon kissing his cheeks and those full, pouty lips, turning them a rosy color. My gaze paused at that sexy little dimple in his chin, the one that made him look so much like Tyler. I had marveled about how much he looked like Tyler, even before I knew.</p><p>His chest hair was sparse and widespread. My gaze dipped lower, drinking in those glorious abs. He worked his ass off to keep them, doing crunches every night. But it paid off when he tore off his shirt mid-concert and tossed it into the crowd. The girls went insane. Not that I blamed them.</p><p>His navel was rimmed with dark hair, a fact everyone knew because girls all over the country already had him pasted to their walls. The one in Tiger Beat, a full-size foldout, reminded me of a Playboy centerfold\u2014only this one was for thirteen year old girls. A shirtless, barefoot Dale with his thumbs hooked in the waistband of acid-washed jeans, pulling that inexplicably sexy studded belt down on his hips, revealing his lower abdominal muscles, those firm, external obliques making a delicious indentation on either side of his body like an arrow pointing south.</p><p>Dale had done that photo shoot on one of his many trips away during the past two years, so girls everywhere could put him on their walls, at just the right height, and stand tiptoe so they could look into those dark, animal eyes and practice kissing on his pouty lips.</p><p>But those pouty lips were mine. I was the only girl in the world who got to kiss them for real and knew just how soft they were. Listening to the deep, even sound of his breathing, I let my fingers lightly follow the dark line of hair that traveled down from his navel. I heard his breath catch when I slipped my hand under the sheet. He was already at half-mast and it didn\u2019t take much stimulation before he was tenting the sheet.</p><p>He moaned softly when I stopped teasing and really started moving my hand rhythmically up and down his shaft. When I lifted my head to look at his face, his eyes were half-open, lips parted, and I managed to elicit another moan from him when I rubbed my thumb back and forth over the head.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I whispered. We always whispered now and tried to keep it down because Chrissy was right next door. Before she moved in, I\u2019d felt less inhibited because John\u2019s room was on the first floor, on the other side of the house.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d His voice was hoarse from sleep. I felt his hand moving in my hair, sliding down the curve of my back to lift the t-shirt I\u2019d worn to bed. I wasn\u2019t wearing any panties. \u201cWanna go for a ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna go for a ride on you.\u201d I grinned, shoving the sheet aside and admiring my handiwork for a moment\u2014straight up hard and ready for me\u2014before straddling him.</p><p>Dale\u2019s eyes lit up when I peeled my t-shirt off, tossing it onto the floor. His hands went instantly to my breasts and my nipples hardened in response. I stroked him against my lower belly, anticipating the feel of him inside of me. Holding off was such sweet torture. But Dale had other plans.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He grabbed my hips, seating me easily over his face, his tongue already exploring.</p><p>I gasped, leaning against the windowsill, the curtains fluttering around me as Dale drank me in. Our room was at the back of the house and the window overlooked over a field of tall unmowed grass and wildflowers. There was no one to see me as I rolled my hips and arched, nails raking the window screen when he pushed me over the edge with the slick lash of his tongue. I bit my lip to keep from crying out, hanging onto the window ledge, my thighs trembling with the force of my orgasm.</p><p>\u201cMmmm.\u201d Dale wiped his mouth with the back of his hand as I slid down his body.\u201dBreakfast of Champions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bad.\u201d But I was smiling as I caught his hard shaft between us, rocking my hips so he parted that slippery seam, so wet from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTaste.\u201d</p><p>Slipping a hand behind my head, he brought me down for a long, hot kiss. I moaned, rocking on top of him, the sensation almost too intense as his hips began to move, seeking entrance. Then his hands moved down my sides, grabbing and guiding me, rolling my hips forward so he was right there, poised for entry.</p><p>I moaned as he lifted his pelvis, his cock parting my labia, sinking slowly into my flesh. Savoring the sensation, I held perfectly still, my eyes locked with his. Then he began to move, rolling his hips, not sliding out all the way, just making slow, short, easy strokes, in and out. He knew exactly how to drive me crazy. I cried out when he moved one hand off my hip, to focus between my thighs, thumb rubbing me in fast little circles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShh,\u201d he urged, pulling me down to him, kissing me quiet as he thrust up into my flesh. I couldn\u2019t help rocking with him, feeling the cool morning breeze caressing our sweat-dampened skin. Dale was so warm and solid, I clung to him, burying my face in his neck, my breath coming hot and fast. His hands were back on my hips, rocking me against him with every upward thrust. I felt how swollen he was inside of me, ready to burst. And I was too.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart,\u201d he moaned, thumbs digging into the wings of my pelvis. \u201cI\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I urged, squeezing his thick, pistoning flesh with my muscles, massaging him. That elicited a low growl from his throat and Dale rolled me quickly over onto my back, parting my thighs with his and rutting deep into me.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I cried, the sight of him poised above me, arms thick ropes of muscle, belly undulating as he drove himself into me again and again. \u201cOh God, yes, Dale! Do it! Harder!\u201d</p> <p>I had forgotten everything but him, seeing the sweet look of pleasure on his face, the way he worked to hold himself back. I knew he was waiting for me, but he didn\u2019t have to\u2014just seeing him like that sent me flying. My orgasm was so sudden and intense I screamed, crying out and thrusting my hips up. Dale cried out too and I felt the exquisite, hot pulse of his cock as he came, emptying himself completely into me, the sensation almost enough to send me over again.</p><p>He groaned and finally collapsed onto me. I loved the weight of him and welcomed it, kissing him softly and pulling the sheet and the comforter back up over our damp skin. The breeze felt good but I was shivering. Dale nuzzled my neck and my ear, his breath returning slowly to normal. His lips moved over my flesh, kissing me here and there, whispering words I could barely hear.</p><p>\u201cCould you two shut the hell up!\u201d Chrissy threw the door open and it banged against the wall. \u201cCan\u2019t you keep that little bitch quiet?\u201d</p><p>I was too stunned to move but Dale reacted instantly, grabbing the sheet around his waist with one hand and striding to the door. I grabbed the edge of the comforter and pulled it up to my chin.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Dale grabbed the handle, swinging the door closed, but Chrissy was in the way.</p> <p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d Chrissy was ready for battle. I could tell. Even through the crack in the door\u2014her knee was blocking the way, so Dale couldn\u2019t close it completely. I scrambled around for clothes\u2014t-shirt, jeans. I didn\u2019t even bother with panties or a bra.</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d Dale\u2019s voice was calm and firm. He\u2019d regained his control after being so surprised by her entrance. I was going to have to ask John if we could put a lock\u2014and maybe even a chain\u2014on our bedroom door. I found socks and tugged them on too.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re really something, don\u2019t you?\u201d Chrissy sneered. I saw her face in the shadows. She was a very pretty girl, long dark hair and blue eyes. She had her brother\u2019s features, only softer and more rounded. But she could make herself ugly in an instant\u2014it was like some magic trick, a strange illusion. \u201cMr. Perfect. Mr. Rockstar. You wouldn\u2019t be anything without him, you know that?\u201d</p><p>I knew she was baiting him, just like she baited her father. I think they were both too blind to see it. John, I knew, would never take that sort of bait. He realized, somehow, that what Chrissy needed was not the negative attention she seemed to be asking for. It went deeper than that. Dale, though\u2014Dale\u2019s fuse was long, but she\u2019d been wearing him down for two weeks and the whole thing was about to explode. I could feel it crackling in the air, like electricity.</p><p>\u201cDale, I have to go.\u201d It was early yet, but a good enough excuse. I ran a hand through my hair, grabbing my purse. I was small enough to insert myself between him and the door. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Ben for coffee and then I have to drop off those drawings at work.\u201d</p><p>He blinked down at me, trying to focus. I knew she\u2019d gotten to him and she knew it too. She just wouldn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cGo.\u201d I pushed him back. \u201cGo back to bed. I\u2019ll see you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>He took a step back from the door and I was relieved. I\u2019d broken the spell. Whatever hold she had over him was fading, even though the words still kept spilling from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you are so fucking pussy-whipped!\u201d Chrissy called as I slipped out into the hall with her, closing our bedroom door behind me. It felt like I was stepping into a gladiator ring with a lion. Or maybe a dragon. Up until now, she\u2019d ignored me, but with Dale safe on the other side of the door, I knew she was going to try to use me to bait him.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t love you, you know.\u201d She crossed her arms, leaning against the wall with a smug smile on her face. She was still in her pajamas\u2014red silk, top and bottoms. \u201cHe just feels sorry for you.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to believe words could hurt that much. Chrissy\u2019s words came attached with razor blades. I tried ignoring it, starting to take a step around her, but she moved with me, blocking the way to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cPoor pathetic little Sara. You poor-me\u2019d your way into free room and board and a rich rock star boyfriend. Do you really think he\u2019s going to marry you?\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe can\u2019t love anyone. He can\u2019t see anything unless it\u2019s a mirror. That\u2019s all you are. A great big mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way.\u201d I took a step to the left but she did too.</p><p>\u201cOh Dale, you\u2019re so wonderful and famous and everyone loves you!\u201d She mocked, yelling this so Dale was sure to hear her. \u201cHe\u2019ll never be Tyler Vincent and he knows it. All he\u2019ll ever be is some cheap, knock-off imitation of the real thing. And that\u2019s the only reason he keeps you around, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>She used that term of endearment with emphasis and I wondered how long she\u2019d been listening at our door this morning. I was trembling inside and my body was shutting down. System overload. I knew the feeling\u2014it used to happen when the stepbeast got like this. I was having flashbacks, sensory memories of recoiling, withdrawing into my shell as far as I could to hide from the oncoming disaster.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Dale opened the door\u2014he had jeans on, but no shirt\u2014and strode toward her. I, of course, was in the way. I turned and pushed him back, both hands on his chest.</p><p>\u201cDale, no.\u201d I glanced back at Chrissy. She was smiling. It was a truly malevolent smile.</p><p>\u201cAlways has to try to prove himself,\u201d Chrissy went on. She sounded downright gleeful. \u201cBecause he knows he\u2019ll never be good enough. Never as good as Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy, I swear to God...\u201d Dale said through clenched teeth, hands curled into fists at his sides. He was looking past me straight at her and I felt like I was holding a tiger by the tail.</p><p>\u201cOh Sara, let him go. You\u2019re going to have to let him go eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale, come on, let\u2019s go downstairs.\u201d I tried to get him to focus on me instead of her. I tried to ignore the searing pain of her words. I just wanted to take Dale and escape. Of course, she was between us and the escape route.</p><p>\u201cSara, you\u2019re a one-trick pony.\u201d She was right behind me now, whispering her words. But she was looking right at her brother. \u201cHe only wanted you because you chose him over Tyler. And I\u2019m sorry, but you can only do that little stunt once. After that, you\u2019re useless.\u201d</p><p>I turned and pushed her. Chrissy stumbled back, surprised, catching herself from falling by steadying herself against the wall. I heard John stirring downstairs. We must have woken him. He was calling but sounded far away, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d Chrissy snarled at me.</p><p>I think they both lunged at the same time. And I was in the middle. I screamed when Dale made a fist and pulled his arm back. I knew he was going to hit her\u2014and she was smiling, triumphant. It was just what she wanted. Oh the publicity that would bring down on our heads. Greg would be furious. And Dale\u2019s career would be over before it began.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried, turning to stop him, but it was too late.</p><p>His fist connected with the side of my cheek with a force that shook my teeth in my head. My ear was ringing and I couldn\u2019t keep my balance. I tried, my hands groping the smooth hallway wall, but I fell, moaning softly, looking up to see Dale\u2019s horrified expression, fists now at his sides. And I heard Chrissy laughing, delighted.</p><p>\u201cSara! Oh God, Sara,\u201d he croaked, kneeling beside me but I was already scrambling to my feet. I felt his hand on my calf for one, brief moment, but I was fast when I needed to be. I flew down the stairs, grabbed my shoes on my way out, and I was already pulling away from the house when I saw Dale burst out the front door, calling after me.</p><p>But I was gone.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>I was early to Cuppa Joes and was glad for the time to put my head back together. I went to the bathroom first to wash my face. My eyes were red from crying. I knew Chrissy\u2019s words weren\u2019t the truth, not the deep, real truth\u2014but they had enough truth in them to sting. I was a mess and I looked it. I hadn\u2019t even showered. And I had the beginnings of a pretty good shiner under my left eye. I peed and ran a comb through my hair and put on what I hoped was enough makeup to cover any bruising. Feeling slightly better, I went back out into the coffee shop.</p><p>I picked a table in the corner, hoping to hide until Ben arrived, but when I looked up as the bell on the door rang, I saw Carrie and Wendy coming in. I didn\u2019t wave to them but they spotted me anyway, making a beeline for my table.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing here without your other half?\u201d Wendy slid into the seat across from me. Carrie grabbed a chair, turning it backwards and straddling it.</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m just meeting a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that code for having an affair?\u201dCarrie raised her eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I blushed. I hadn\u2019t told many people about Ben yet. Aimee and Matt. Josh, at work. And John\u2014but I\u2019d asked him not to tell Chrissy. Why give her any more ammunition than she already had? \u201cI\u2019m actually meeting my... Dad.\u201d</p><p>Wendy sat back in her chair and Carrie did a double-take. I realized they must be thinking of the stepbeast, so I had to redirect them with an explanation. While I was telling the strange, coincidental story of Ben finding me because of the picture in the paper, the waitress came over and we all ordered\u2014coffee for them, hot chocolate for me. Plus muffins and scones and croissants.</p><p>\u201cAnd he moved here?\u201d Wendy shook her head, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cWell, he was already moving here,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cMakes it even weirder,\u201d Carrie said through a mouth full of blueberry muffin. \u201cDid you tell Aimee?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, blowing across the top of my hot chocolate. It lived up to its name and was always too hot to drink right away. I wondered if Aimee had told them her big news, but my question was answered by Carrie\u2019s next statement.</p><p>\u201cThat poor girl is never going to make it to the end of her pregnancy. My mother is going to be the death of her.\u201d Carrie had succeeded in eating the entire top of her muffin and was now peeling the paper off the sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe minute Aimee told the family she was pregnant, my mom started watching what she eats like a hawk. She\u2019s such a fatphobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomophobe too,\u201d Wendy interjected, sipping her coffee, a croissant in her other hand.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d I interjected. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to get fat when you\u2019re pregnant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should hear my mom.\u201d Carrie rolled her eyes. \u201c\u2019You don\u2019t want to use this as an excuse to eat junk, dear.\u2019 I keep telling her to knock it off but every time I turn around it\u2019s all, \u2018No ice cream for you, we don\u2019t want any fat babies in this family!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I put down my hot chocolate and decided to work on my scone.</p><p>\u201cJust because we\u2019re all long and lean she thinks the whole world should be that way.\u201d Carrie put the entire bottom of the muffin into her mouth. When she chewed, she looked like a chipmunk.</p><p>\u201cPoor Aimee.\u201d I made a mental note to call her. Our senior year had been the perfect storm of disaster. I had to drop out because of my pregnancy, and then Aimee had gone into treatment for her eating disorder. I was so grateful they let her come when I went to the hospital or I wouldn\u2019t have had anyone there with me at all. I knew Aimee was sensitive about her weight\u2014she probably always would be\u2014and it sounded like her new mother-in-law was pushing all her buttons.</p><p>\u201c\u201dOkay, done.\u201d Carrie gulped the rest of her coffee. \u201cAre you sure you brought the shot records, Wen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Wendy rolled her eyes, still nibbling on her croissant.</p> <p>\u201cShot records?\u201d I asked, finally able to sip my hot chocolate.</p><p>\u201cWe got a puppy.\u201d Carrie grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s our moving in together present to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re moving in together?\u201d I exclaimed. That was huge\u2014Carrie\u2019s mother didn\u2019t know she was gay and Wendy\u2019s parents\u2014well they didn\u2019t care if she was much of anything.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re \u2018roommates,\u2019\u201d Wendy said, making air quotes with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I don\u2019t want to leave him in the car too long.\u201d Carrie was practically bouncing in her chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done!\u201d Wendy protested.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of puppy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBoxer.\u201d Wendy slung her purse forward and opened the top flap. \u201cHere\u2019s a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww!\u201d Of course he was adorable. \u201cWhat a darling little puppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be dead little puppy if we leave him much longer.\u201d Carrie snapped her fingers. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one who insisted we stop,\u201d Wendy said to me, rolling her eyes. \u201cNow she\u2019s in a big hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s my dad.\u201d It still felt a little strange referring to Ben as \u201cmy dad.\u201d I called him Ben when we were together\u2014if I called him anything. I tried not to let it come up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your dad?\u201d Carrie raised her pierced eyebrow. The pink streaks were back in her hair again. \u201cNiiiiice. If I swung the other way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up.\u201d Wendy put her croissant down, gulping the rest of her coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s give Sara and her dad some privacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout time!\u201d Carrie waggled her fingers at me and I waved back as they left, passing Ben on the way.</p><p>\u201cFriends of yours?\u201d he asked, sliding into the seat across from me. He was wearing a suit, ready for work.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I watched them walk past the front window and disappear around the corner. \u201cFrom high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, what happened to your eye?\u201d Ben frowned, reaching over to touch my cheek. I winced\u2014it hurt. He looked at his thumb where he\u2019d touched the bruise. \u201cMakeup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I covered my cheek. I\u2019d forgotten. \u201cI... stupid, I was on a stool in the kitchen and I slipped. Hit it on the edge of a cupboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He nodded, still frowning.</p><p>How many times had I heard my mother give excuses like that? I\u2019d learned from the master.</p><p>\u201cSo how is the new place?\u201d I asked, changing the subject. His company had moved him up from Florida\u2014they even packed it all!\u2014but his house hadn\u2019t been ready so they set him up in an apartment temporarily. Now he was finally moving into his permanent house.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he replied, finally smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to come by and see for yourself. Bring the boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d It had been weeks and it still seemed surreal. Sometimes I forgot that the man sitting across from me was my biological father. Dale was still wary, but he knew I was talking to Ben, that we met for coffee at least once a week. Ben knew Dale was suspicious and he had gone, without any prompting, and had a DNA blood test done. It was very expensive, but he hadn\u2019t asked for a dime.</p><p>When I triumphantly told Dale that, he said, \u201cI hope he isn\u2019t going to try to show you fake test results. Maybe we should do another one?\u201d</p><p>When Ben agreed to have his blood drawn again for a separate test, Dale said, \u201cI hope he\u2019s not long gone before these results come back.\u201d</p><p>I could never win!</p><p>And I knew Dale was avoiding spending any time with Ben, refusing to get to know him. I was ready to lock them both in a room until they stopped the nonsense. Well, until Dale did. Ben had gone out of his way to be friendly and inclusive. It just made Dale look even more ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I tore off the triangle at end of my scone, dunking it into my hot chocolate before putting it into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d He cleared his throat, reaching under the table for his briefcase. I watched as he opened it, taking out a manila folder. He set it on the table and slid it over toward me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019d swallowed my scone but it felt like it was still stuck in my throat. A little voice in my head whispered, \u201cDale was right all along,\u201d but I tried to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know much about the computers? The internet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d I shook my head, still looking at the folder on the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s this new thing... I guess it\u2019s not really a thing and it\u2019s not actually that new. It\u2019s like a place, except it isn\u2019t real.\u201d Ben laughed nervously. \u201cI\u2019m not explaining it well. Listen, I build computers. That\u2019s what I do. You can do a lot of things with computers and some day they\u2019re going to be an integral part of our lives. They\u2019re going to be like TVs. Everyone will have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d I frowned. Just this year the library had put computers in. They had card catalogs still, but you could also look books up on their computers. I hadn\u2019t used them much. It felt too science fiction to me.</p><p>\u201cOne of the things people can do with computers is talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re typing to each other, not talking,\u201d Ben explained. \u201cBut the thing about it is that you can talk to anyone, from anywhere. You can be here in New Jersey and they can be in Bangladesh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird. Why would I want to talk to a stranger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, say there\u2019s something going on in the news or entertainment. Something interesting. People could talk about it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean type about it?\u201d I snorted. \u201cI type with two fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds weird.\u201d Ben flushed. \u201cBut it\u2019s coming. And I have a friend\u2014well, it\u2019s a business associate, really. He\u2019s come up with an idea that\u2019s going to connect people like that. So we can all talk to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you have to have a computer first,\u201d I reminded him. The last time I\u2019d seen a computer, outside of the library, was as a freshman in high school. They offered Computers 101 and we wrote code in something called Basic. All I remembered was I got a C in it and had written a program that asked your name, your age, your gender and your favorite candy bar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s new,\u201d Ben agreed. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to double, maybe even triple, our investment money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur investment money?\u201d I glanced at the folder again. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any...\u201d</p><p>Dale was right. Dale was right all along.</p><p>\u201cI know you said you were worried about Dale and the money he\u2019s spending,\u201d Ben said. \u201cLook, Sara, I want you to have a comfortable future. I don\u2019t want you to have to struggle and paint designs on t-shirts for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly accurate, but I decided not to quibble about what I did at the print shop.</p><p>\u201cThe music business is tough. I mean, when I was a kid, there were tons of bands and music artists making records. But only a handful of them are still around. What happens to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them go broke.\u201d He leaned back in his chair, briefcase balanced in his lap. \u201cBecause they spent all their money on booze and dope. They started rolling in the money and thought the money fountain would go on forever. But eventually the money fountain stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you... what? Want money?\u201d I could barely get that last word out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an investment,\u201d Ben explained. \u201cYou\u2019d get your money back. Plus more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it\u2019s not my money. You know that.\u201d I picked up the folder but I didn\u2019t open it. \u201cI can ask Dale about it.\u201d</p><p>I had no intention of doing any such thing. But I didn\u2019t tell him that.</p><p>\u201cListen, I have to get to the shop,\u201d I said, standing and slinging my purse over my shoulder. \u201cI have some drawings to drop off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay sure.\u201d Ben stood too. \u201cListen, I can come by and talk to Dale about it. Explain it better. You can even come with me to work and see how the prototype works. He\u2019s got a brilliant marketing plan. It will be a household name inside a year, a guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It wasn\u2019t okay. Nothing was okay. This man, who claimed to be my father\u2014now I was doubting everything he\u2019d told me\u2014didn\u2019t find me because he wanted to meet his daughter. He saw \u201crock star\u201d and thought \u201cinvestment money.\u201d</p><p>Dale was right.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t say anything as I started to walk away.</p><p>I turned back and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this thing called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to call it Americans Online,\u201d Ben replied. \u201cI think we should think more globally, but I\u2019m not the guy in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid name.\u201d I made a face. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>I managed to make it all the way to work. I even got the drawings from my case in the back seat and turned them in to Dave without too much trouble. It was in the print shop parking lot it hit me like a two-by-four in the gut. I didn\u2019t make it back to my car. I sobbed and sobbed, collapsed against the side of the building, hugging my knees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSara?\u201d Josh. I looked up, blinking at him through prisms. The early morning sun was bright and it was already warm. It was going to be a scorcher. \u201cSara, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I lied, wiping away tears and snot and make-up with the tail end of my t-shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey come on.\u201d He put his back against the wall and sank down next to me. \u201cYou can tell me. Wow, what happened to your eye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale punched me in the face.\u201d I gave a little laugh. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been the best part of my day so far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe what?\u201d His muscles tensed.</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d I sniffed, wiping my face again, this time with my hands. \u201cHe was trying to hit his sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Josh kept asking that, like he couldn\u2019t quite believe what I was saying.</p><p>\u201cAnd Ben... the guy who got in touch when he saw me in the paper? He said he was my father. And I... I believed him.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed past the lump in my throat.</p> <p>\u201cAnd all he really wants is money.\u201d I felt the sobs rising again and couldn\u2019t stop them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, Josh?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, looking as confused as I felt.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t anyone ever want me? For me? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Sara.\u201d He put his arm over my shoulder and I leaned into him, letting him comfort me. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Nothing. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would convince you?\u201d I felt his hand stroking my hair, my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. You\u2019re smart. You\u2019re an amazing artist. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said the last one twice.\u201d I looked up at him, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He turned his head toward me and I realized at that moment how close we were. I went to move away but it was too late. Josh was kissing me, holding me so close it was hard to breath. His lips were thin and strange against mine, foreign, an affront to my sense.</p><p>\u201cJosh, no,\u201d I gasped, managing to push him away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought... you said no one wanted you.\u201d His gaze moved from my face, traveling south. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>No. No. this couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>Dale was right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to...\u201d I swallowed, feeling dizzy, but I stood anyway. \u201cGo. I need to go.\u201d</p><p>That was, of course, when Dale showed up in John\u2019s car. I recognized the Taurus as it pulled into the lot and saw Dale behind the wheel. His eyes darkened when he saw who I was with. Josh was on his feet, next to me, standing too close.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for letting me cry on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d Josh pulled me into a hug, his arms lingering around me even as I tried to free myself. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Dale was already out of the car. He hadn\u2019t even put a shirt on. He was still barefoot, wearing just a pair of jeans. And his belt. He\u2019d stopped to put on his belt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been driving all over looking for you.\u201d Dale glared at Josh but I\u2019d met him halfway to the car and guided him back toward it. He looked back over his shoulder at Josh. \u201cWhat the hell is he doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe works here, remember?\u201d I looked over and saw Josh going back into the store.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dale\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t leave the store front. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he jumped at the chance to \u2018comfort\u2019 you, didn\u2019t he? Did he come on to you?\u201d</p><p>Then he looked at me. I think it was the first time he really saw me since he\u2019d blazed into the parking lot. His eyes softened and his brow knitted.</p><p>\u201cDid I do that?\u201d He touched my cheek. I winced and so did he. \u201cOh Sara. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I let him pull me into his arms. The comfort I found there was like nothing else. Josh\u2019s arms around me had been nice, but not like this. Dale\u2019s arms around me felt like something clicked into place. We fit together like two puzzle pieces. In so many ways, good and bad, we fit together.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t crying about that.\u201d I touched my cheek and laughed. \u201cI told Josh, that was the highlight of my day so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d Dale groaned, gathering me closer. \u201cWhat do you mean it was the highlight of your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in the car.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near this place when I told him. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about yours?\u201d Dale asked as he opened the passenger door for me, nodding to my Dodge Dart.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come get it later.\u201d I got in, waiting for him to get in too. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d He put the key in the ignition.</p><p>\u201cJust drive.\u201d I leaned back in the seat, closing my eyes. My face was hot and swollen from crying. My heart was shattered into a million pieces, but it was still beating in my chest.</p><p>I felt Dale\u2019s hand slipping into mine and opened my eyes, turning my head to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hit her, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister?\u201d Dale snorted. \u201cNo. I wanted to. But no. Not after you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I gave a satisfied nod. \u201cIt\u2019s what she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Dale squeezed my hand. \u201cYou know... the things she said...\u201d</p><p>I winced again, and this time it wasn\u2019t because my face hurt. Thinking about what Chrissy had said made me nauseous.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is. Everything she said. It was about her. Not about you and me.\u201d He took his eyes off the road for a minute to look at me. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. It still hurt too much to not take it all very literally.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s keeping a huge secret.\u201d Dale sighed, taking a left at the light. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not easy. I know.\u201d</p><p>I knew too.</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s in so much pain. All she wants is for Tyler to acknowledge her. I accepted a long time ago that wasn\u2019t going to happen. But that\u2019s what she really wants.\u201d I looked over and saw his eyes gleaming. Tears? He\u2019d never talked about his sister this way. \u201cSo I blamed her for choosing him. You know, Chrissy and I were close, once. Before.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know. The way he talked about her, with so much anger and hatred, I never would have guessed.</p><p>\u201cBut she chose him.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cJust like my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of you,\u201d I whispered. He\u2019d been abandoned not only by his mother but his sister too. And I knew Chrissy was right, in a small way. There were small bits of truth in what she said, wrapped up in anger and pain, sugar coated razor blades. Dale was trying to prove himself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it felt at the time,\u201d he agreed and I actually saw a tear slip down his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I wanted to reach over and pull him into my arms, but he was driving\u2014besides, there was something about it, the car moving, both of us facing forward, that made it easier to say these things.</p><p>\u201cIs that why I was such a challenge?\u201d I asked. My voice cracked and even as I asked, I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know the answer. \u201cYou wanted me to choose you instead of Tyler?\u201d</p><p>Dale was quiet. There was just the sound of the tires on pavement. Houses slipped by us.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said finally. \u201cChrissy has a way of seeing into people like that. And she\u2019s usually right. Maybe, subconsciously, that\u2019s why I chose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I chose you because you were like Tyler.\u201d</p><p>Dale turned the car into an empty parking lot I recognized, pulling into a spot and putting the car in park. He\u2019d taken us to Iselin Academy, the place we\u2019d first met. Where I\u2019d been swept away by the new guy, the one who looked so much like rock star Tyler Vincent. Where Dale had found a girl so obsessed with the man who had ruined his life, it would be the ultimate triumph to sway her allegiance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably more like him than I want to admit.\u201d He leaned back, thumbs hooked over his belt. \u201cThe more I try not to be like him, the more it seems I am...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I countered. \u201cYou\u2019re not a liar. You haven\u2019t hurt people like he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Dale took a deep breath, closing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m keeping his secret. So is Chrissy. And it\u2019s eating us both alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell,\u201d I urged. \u201cJohn won\u2019t love you any less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy\u2019s right.\u201d He looked over at me with a small, sad smile. \u201cI\u2019m selfish. I\u2019m keeping the secret for my own selfish reasons. You know what would happen if it came out that I was Tyler Vincent\u2019s son?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Greg Richer had harped enough about public image for me to understand what it would do to Dale\u2019s career. Even if it wasn\u2019t a scandal, it would mean a lifetime of Dale being compared to his father, which was the last thing in the world he wanted to have happen.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou were right about Josh. He tried to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>I left out the part about the actual kissing. Dale\u2019s reaction was strong enough to an attempted kiss.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d He pounded his fist on the steering wheel and I sank back in my seat.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were right about Ben,\u201d I choked. \u201cHe asked me for money today. Some... I don\u2019t know, computer investment? Made it sound like he was concerned for my future or something, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Sara.\u201d Dale put his arms around me. \u201cDamnit. I didn\u2019t want to be right about Ben. Or Josh, for that matter. He better keep his damned hands off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I rested my cheek against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m going on tour with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Josh? Because of Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you.\u201d I lifted my head to look into his eyes. \u201cAnd I know you love me. Chrissy may be right about the things that drew us together in the first place... but that isn\u2019t why we\u2019ve stayed together.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me and I knew I would never in my lifetime find another man like the one holding me in his arms. I could let him go and spend the rest of my life searching for someone to fill the void he left. We found each other through our wounds, our sad and broken places. And we were healing each other too. Slowly and with great effort, but it was happening. And maybe that was the real magic of love. We started out two broken people and together, we created something entirely new and whole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you,\u201d he whispered as we parted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life trying to be the man you see when you look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are him.\u201d I put my head on his chest, tears slipping down my cheeks as I closed my eyes. \u201cYou always were.\u201d</p><p>We sat quietly and I knew it was no accident that he\u2019d somehow found his way here. By chance or by design, it was meant to be. We were meant to be. It was the one thing\u2014maybe the only thing\u2014I would ever know for certain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, I want to show you something.\u201d He reached over and opened the glove compartment, pulling out a newspaper. I recognized it immediately. There we were, making out, on the front of the entertainment section. It still made me wince.</p><p>At least that hadn\u2019t created the fallout that Greg, Mr.Doom and Gloom, had predicted. He\u2019d mailed us a Teen Beat magazine with that picture of Dale and a poll of his girl fans. Sixty-eight percent said it bothered them that Dale had a girlfriend. That same sixty-eight percent said they would still listen to his music anyway. Ninety percent said if they found he had a girlfriend, it would make them jealous. That same ninety-percent also said it would just make them more determined to win the rocker\u2019s affections.</p><p>I told Dale I didn\u2019t like Teen Beat giving his fans ideas.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d Dale pointed to the picture of him putting the garter on my leg at Aimee\u2019s wedding. \u201cLook at your shoulder.\u201d</p> <p>I brought the paper closer, holding it tilted toward the sunlight. My dress had a scoop neck and back, revealing cleavage in front and a good expanse of my bare back.</p><p>\u201cMy birthmark,\u201d I whispered. It was right there for everyone to see.</p><p>\u201cIt may not mean anything,\u201d Dale murmured, reaching over to touch my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t show you. I didn\u2019t want to spoil things if he really was your dad...\u201d</p><p>Lies. All lies.</p><p>He had just wanted money, after all.</p> <p>\u201cI can have him investigated,\u201d Dale offered. \u201cI mean, he could still be who he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d I tossed the paper on the floor. \u201cHe never wanted me, whoever he is. He only wanted to take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sara.\u201d He gathered me in and I fit myself against him, soft curves melting into sharp angles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I should have listened to you,\u201d I murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s go home. I want a do-over on this day.\u201d</p><p>But the worst part of the day was yet to come.</p><p>Chrissy was gone with her new found friends to the local mall but John was waiting for us, looking concerned.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d I assured him, giving him a long, long hug when we got into the door.</p><p>\u201cYou got a phone call.\u201d He hugged me back. \u201cI told him you\u2019d call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to Ben,\u201d I replied wearily, disengaging myself and heading toward the stairs. \u201cI want to go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Ben,\u201d John said, glancing over at Dale. He still looked very worried. \u201cIt was the prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>I froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they want?\u201d Dale grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cYour stepfather...\u201d John met my eyes and I felt everything inside me turn to ice water. \u201cPeter Holmes is getting out of jail. Parolled. Time served for good behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood behavior?\u201d I laughed. The irony was too painful to bear.</p> <p>\u201cSara?\u201d John called as I turned, zombie-like, and started up the stairs. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I called back in a little voice. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take a nap.\u201d</p><p>Dale followed me up the stairs. He helped me undress. I seemed to have forgotten how to unbutton and unzip things. Then he took off his pants and got in, spooning behind me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to find me,\u201d I whispered to the wall.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dale stroked my hair. \u201cThe reporters couldn\u2019t even find us, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen found me.\u201d I closed my eyes, feeling tears slip down onto the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d His arms tightened, enfolding me. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m here. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but I knew better.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t protect each other, not all of the time, even the people we loved the most. Sometimes things happened. Sometimes they were very, very bad things, and nothing we did or said could stop them from happening.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>The tour started in Florida. That irony didn\u2019t escape me, since Ben was from Florida. He\u2019d called several times but I told John to tell him I wasn\u2019t home and I had left without saying goodbye. We flew down in the record company\u2019s private jet. I told Dale I didn\u2019t want to be his Yoko, but things had already gotten off to a rocky start. The members of Black Diamond had never liked me. I distracted Dale too much from the band. Which, early on, I had to admit was true, but it wasn\u2019t true anymore. Well, it wasn\u2019t as true.</p><p>It was the lead guitarist, Rick\u2014I called him a Dale wannabe when Dale wasn\u2019t around\u2014who was the biggest problem. He said if Dale could bring me, then he could bring his wife and kid. I didn\u2019t even know he had a kid. So Greg had solved the problem by giving me a job on the tour. I was in charge of fashion and style.</p><p>\u201cYou went to art school, right?\u201d Greg had asked. \u201cGood. Make them into rock gods.\u201d</p><p>A tall order. At least for the rest of Black Diamond, which consisted of Rick Baker, a grumpy, bitter lead guitarist with an bowl haircut who like to wear parachute pants, Terry Miller, whose spiky, white-blonde Billy Idol hair was his best and worst feature, and Eddie \u201cBear\u201d Allen, a two-hundred-and-fifty pound drummer who insisted on wearing sweatbands on his head and wrists while he played and I was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t shaved since 1984.</p><p>Of course, when it came to Dale, I didn\u2019t have to do anything. He had his own sense of style, always had. That was part of what drew girls to him. Not the clothes, but that he knew who he was. He had a kind of lazy confidence, a self-assurance. He was comfortable in his own skin. That came across in everything about him, from his smirk of a smile to the dancing light in his eyes. He could have worn anything\u2014or nothing\u2014and the girls would have gone crazy.</p><p>When we touched down in Orlando, I finally let go of Dale\u2019s hand\u2014it was red and swollen from my squeezing it\u2014more than ready to get off the plane. It was only the second time I\u2019d been on one and I was still a nervous flyer. The band had complained, but I was glad we\u2019d be on the ground in a bus for the rest of the tour.</p><p>\u201cLook at that.\u201d Dale showed me his hand again as we walked down the stairway and onto the tarmac. \u201cI think you left a thumbprint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I apologized again. I was so grateful to be on solid ground again I could have kissed it. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>There was a line of cars parked, waiting for us. Chelsea had taken care of everything. As much as I disliked Greg Richer, I adored Chelsea Caldwell. Chelsea was Dark Wing\u2019s tour manager, and she handled everything. Not only did she juggle transportation for Dark Wing, she juggled the opening act\u2014Black Diamond\u2014plus the entire crew. Dark Wing had taken their own plane, so Black Diamond and the crew traveled together.</p><p>Chelsea was constantly in motion, always on the phone\u2014she had one strapped to her belt, a giant, clunky thing with a big antennae\u2014and the only time she wasn\u2019t talking on it was when we were actually in the air. She practically ran down the stairs as soon as the plane was on the ground, barking orders left and right, her frizzy red hair managing to escape its moorings to blow around her freckled cheeks as she directed the crew as they came off the plane,</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s yours,\u201d Chelsea put a hand on Dale\u2019s shoulder, pointing to the car in back. It was different from the other ones. It looked like a regular taxi, only white instead of yellow. \u201cHave a great time, you two!\u201d</p><p>Then she was off again. I glanced up at Dale, curious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d He grinned, slipping an arm around my waist and leading me toward the taxi.</p><p>The show wasn\u2019t until tomorrow and we\u2019d taken an early morning flight out. Dale hated mornings and had grumbled sleepily until we were on the plane. Black Diamond got to sit up front in what was effectively first class while the crew rode coach. As soon as Dale was buckled in, he leaned back and fell asleep. He could sleep anywhere. In the meantime, I had closed my eyes and rested my head on his shoulder and pretended to sleep, but he had the marks on his hand to prove I was awake for most of the flight.</p><p>\u201cYou know where we\u2019re going?\u201d Dale asked the driver as we got in the back.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The driver was a scruffy old guy with white hair and a southern accent. It was weird to hear him calling Dale sir.</p><p>\u201cHe gets to know where we\u2019re going and I don\u2019t?\u201d I pouted.</p><p>\u201cSur-priiiiise,\u201d he whispered, wrapping his arm around me, pulling my head to his chest. \u201cBe a good girl and close your eyes\u2014don\u2019t peek or I\u2019ll have to get the blindfold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blindfold!\u201d I gasped, starting to raise my head</p><p>\u201cI said, don\u2019t peek!\u201d Dale put his hand over my eyes. \u201cBad girl.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at him but I don\u2019t know if he saw me. The cabbie had the air conditioner on\u2014it was August in Florida at nine a.m. and already ninety degrees. I think I started sweating the minute I stepped off the plane.</p><p>\u201cCan I at least guess?\u201d I asked. I was trying to think of what it might be but was drawing a blank.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Dale kissed the top of my head. \u201cTake a nap. You were strung so tight on the plane I thought you were going to snap in two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? You were sleeping!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know.\u201d He peeked under his hand and I blinked up at him. \u201cClose those pretty eyes and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I was tired\u2014he was right, I\u2019d been so tense on the plane I practically jumped out of my seat every time we hit a little bump. I knew, statistically, I had been safer in the plane than I was now in the taxi, but for some reason my body didn\u2019t like that logic. I relaxed against Dale, leaving my eyes closed, and did just what he told me.</p><p>I drifted off.</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d</p><p>Dale\u2019s voice woke me. He sat up fully, taking me with him as I opened my eyes, stretching and yawning before I remembered.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to see.\u201d He pointed out the cabbie\u2019s front window and I blinked, clearing my still-fuzzy vision.</p><p>I looked up at the sign spanning the freeway just as we passed underneath it.</p><p>\u201cWalt Disney World?\u201d I blinked at him, a half-smile already on my lips. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me? Walt Disney World?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s for kids, but you never got to go.\u201d He shrugged, looking sheepish. \u201cI thought we could go be kids for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalt Disney World!\u201d I squealed, throwing my arms around him and bursting into tears at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Dale looked alarmed, pulling back to look at me. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d I was crying so hard, my voice was halted and hitched in my chest. \u201cNever... thought... I never... got... to go...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I was going to give you everything you ever wanted.\u201d Dale cupped my wet teary face in his hands, kissing each cheek \u201cAnd I meant it.\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around him again, still crying, but they were happy tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d The cabbie handed back a Kleenex box, taking one for himself and dabbing at his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I sniffed, wiping my wet face as we approached the gates.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made this drive a hundred times, Miss,\u201d the cabbie said as he pulled over to let us off. \u201cFrom first timers to cancer kids, I\u2019ve dropped them right here\u2014and this is the only time someone\u2019s actually made me cry. Damnit.\u201d</p><p>He reached back for the Kleenex and I handed him the box. I saw his name on the visor and a little jolt when through me. His name was Benjamin Grouse. Ben.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I didn\u2019t know if I was thanking the cabbie or Dale but they both said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the time of your life!\u201d the cabbie called, rolling down the passenger side window so we could hear him as we climbed out of the back seat. I asked Dale if we should pay, but he said Chelsea had taken care of it.</p><p>\u201cWe should give him something...\u201d I opened my purse and leaned down to hand him two dollars.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank yourself, lil miss.\u201d He smiled, dropping me a wink. I wasn\u2019t sure what that meant but the feeling came through all the same. \u201cYou stay all the way to the end, for the fireworks. It\u2019s a helluva show.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will.\u201d I gave him a little wave and moved back as he pulled away from the curb.</p><p>Dale took my hand, swinging it as we walked into the park.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have to pay?\u201d I asked as he strolled past the line of people waiting to get in.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d Dale reached under his t-shirt and pulled out a laminated card on a lanyard. Then he reached into his back pocket, producing another one to hang around my neck. \u201cYour key to the kingdom, princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already found my prince, remember?\u201d I kissed him, intending for it just to be a quick, sweet kiss, but his hands moved to my lower back and I wrapped my arms around his neck and suddenly we were really kissing, completely lost, the world around us melting away.</p><p>\u201cEwwwwwwwwww they\u2019re KISSing!\u201d a little voice piped up beside us and I looked down to see a kid about five, curly blond hair and big, blue-eyes, pointing at us.</p> <p>\u201cCody, that\u2019s not nice. Come on over here.\u201d His mother, carrying a toddler on her hip and pushing a stroller with a newborn in it, tried to pull him away, but her hands were rather full.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll chance your mind some day, kid,\u201d Dale said, giving him a wink. I smiled at the mom, who smiled back. I wondered where her husband was\u2014who would go to Disney alone with three kids under five?</p><p>\u201cI will not!\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think Cinderella is pretty?\u201d I teased.</p><p>He hesitated, frowning. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sleeping Beauty?\u201d Dale inquired</p><p>Cody\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI like her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe found his type,\u201d Dale said to me in a low voice. I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cIf Sleeping Beauty wouldn\u2019t wake up unless you kissed her... would you do it?\u201d Dale asked.</p><p>Cody made a face. We\u2019d clearly stumped him. He didn\u2019t like kissing, but clearly he did like being the hero.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said finally, with a very dramatic sigh. \u201cBut it was be a very fast kiss! Not like you guys. Ewwwwwww!\u201d</p><p>We were back to \u201cewwwwww.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d Dale held out his hand for high-five and Cody gave him one. \u201cSee you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to the Haunted Mansion!\u201d Cody exclaimed, his blue eyes even bluer when they opened wide like that.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna be scared?\u201d Dale asked.</p><p>Cody hesitated, just a beat. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna do it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man!\u201d Another high five. Dale put his hand next to his mouth, leaning in toward Cody, pretending to tell him a secret. \u201cI\u2019m going to take her through the Haunted Mansion. She\u2019s going to be so scared, she\u2019ll jump right in my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kiss her?\u201d Cody whispered, looking over at me, speculative.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man!\u201d Cody exclaimed, holding up his little hand for a high-five. I couldn\u2019t help laughing as Dale gave him one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not molesting me in the Haunted Mansion,\u201d I informed him as we waved goodbye to Cody and his mom\u2014who had been so busy with the fussy baby in the stroller the whole time, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d heard much of our conversation. I wondered what Cody was going to ask that night, as his mom tucked him into bed, about girls and kissing.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m not,\u201d Dale countered, slapping my behind as we walked through the front gates with our passes. I felt the stares\u2014and glares\u2014of everyone in line. I was beginning to learn that having a rock star boyfriend did have its advantages.</p><p>He was true to his word. I was groped in the Haunted Mansion, on the Small World ride, in front of the Wizard of Oz animatronics, on the monorail and in front of the aquarium. We took our own sky cab and rode it over everything and made out for at least half the ride. There were fountains that shot streams of water over the sidewalks, from one fountain to the other. We got soaked standing in front of them, laughing like idiots the whole time.</p><p>I wanted to see and do everything. We ate junk all day\u2014cotton candy and hot dogs\u2014as we sprinted from one place to the next, our passes giving us instant access to rides and attractions. It was amazing, we just went to the front of the line and they waved us right through. We did Epcot first, where we attended a class on how to draw Disney characters. By the time the teacher was done talking, I had a whole cast drawn on my board and Dale had managed to make Mickey\u2019s body, a little misshapen, and one sad ear.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have suggested this,\u201d Dale sighed, looking at my drawing. \u201cYou\u2019ve unmanned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just outdrew you,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Everyone came over to exclaim over my drawing and someone in a suit came over and asked if I wanted a job drawing for Disney. Dale watched the whole exchange with his jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cMaybe some day,\u201d I told the suit\u2014his name was David something\u2014taking Dale\u2019s hand. \u201cRight now we have to go on an undersea adventure!\u201d</p><p>David gave me his card anyway. David Grommet, head of Animation Academy.</p><p>\u201cGood to know I\u2019ll have something to fall back on if this whole rock star thing falls through,\u201d I teased as we made our way through the crowd.</p><p>It was nearing sunset when my enthusiasm started to wane a little. We\u2019d been up since five and had eaten enough sugar to kill Dumbo. Or maybe even Dumbo\u2019s mother. I leaned my head on Dale\u2019s shoulder as we sat, resting our feet, on the edge of one of the fountains.</p><p>\u201cYou ready for fireworks?\u201d Dale kissed the top of my head, warming me all the way to my toes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my fireworks.\u201d I nuzzled my face into his neck, feathering kisses there.</p><p>\u201cMmm keep that up and you\u2019re going to get more than fireworks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I traced my tongue along the salty trail of his collarbone.</p><p>Dale stood, suddenly all business, taking my hand and leading me.</p><p>I tromped along beside him, exhausted, whining, \u201cWhere are we going? I was comfortable!\u201d</p><p>But Dale was clearly on a mission so I just followed, trudging through crowds\u2014they were thinning out a little\u2014into a restaurant. More stairs! Ugh. We climbed those too.</p><p>\u201cCan I sit now?\u201d I asked as we went around a corner and the whole world opened up to a view that made me gasp out loud. You could see the Magic Kingdom Castle, lights below making it glow purple, from the restaurant\u2019s terrace. It was truly like a fairy tale.</p><p>\u201cHow about you sit here?\u201d Dale grabbed a chair and pulled onto his lap. I laughed, looking at the desserts laid out on the counter in front of us. There were berry tarts and chocolate covered strawberries and delicate, lacey cookies. The perfect end to our junk food eating day. I sat, contented, in Dale\u2019s lap and fed him strawberries, licking chocolate off his lips, until the fireworks show.</p><p>Which was beyond spectacular. Old Ben had been spot on, suggesting we stay. It was a glorious, magical display and I leaned back against Dale, who stretched out his legs and held me around the waist, my head resting against his shoulder. We were in our own little world. I hardly noticed all the other people around us watching the fireworks\u2014couples as well as families with little kids whose eyes were starry after the fireworks display.</p><p>I groaned as I rolled off Dale and stood up.</p><p>\u201cMy feet hurt.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, putting his arms around me. \u201cI guess going dancing on Pleasure Island is out then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleasure Island?\u201d I perked up. \u201cThat sounds fun and exotic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of night clubs. You want to go?\u201d</p><p>I considered it, putting my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather you just take me to bed.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his lips to mine. The way he slowly, softly ran his tongue across the seam of my lips, asking for entrance, made my whole body surrender to him and I melted into him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I breathed when we parted. I felt tears threatening again but I held them back. I didn\u2019t want to turn into a blubbering idiot in the middle of a restaurant. There were still enough people around to notice.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, touching his forehead to mine. \u201cYou are so much better than fireworks. Just watching you watch them, seeing that light in your eyes, makes me love you so much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d He took my hand, pressing it against his chest.</p><p>He was a rock star with the soul of a poet. I kissed him again, long and hard and sweet.</p><p>\u201cEwwwwwwwwwww!\u201d</p><p>I startled, looking around, and saw Cody and his mom\u2014and there was his dad, holding the toddler. Mom had the baby.</p><p>\u201cHey little dude!\u201d Dale called, waving across the terrace at him. \u201cDid you like the fireworks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeahhhhh!\u201d His eyes were still all starry. \u201cThey were way cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Dale gave him the thumbs up, taking my hand in his other hand. He started leading me toward the exit.</p><p>\u201cDid you kiss her in the Haunted Mansion?\u201d Cody called.</p><p>Dale stopped and looked back. I was trying to keep a straight face. Then Dale winked and gave him a big thumbs up.</p><p>\u201cGood man!\u201d Cody called back, giving him two enthusiastic little thumbs up right back.</p><p>I laughed as we headed down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYour feet still hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d With the power of the pass, Dale got us one of those little golf carts I saw Disney employees running around in. We drove it to the front of the park and left it with one of the attendants.</p><p>\u201cYour first show is tomorrow.\u201d It just hit me as we were sitting there on the bench, waiting. Dale had used the phone in the attendant\u2019s booth to call Chelsea to handle getting us back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He leaned back on the bench, thumbs hooked in his belt.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a little?\u201d I raised my eyebrows, searching his face.</p><p>\u201cWell... maybe a little.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re gonna do it anyway?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d I gave him two thumbs up and he laughed.</p><p>I leaned my head against his shoulder as we waited, feeling so very blessed.</p><p>I knew I was the luckiest girl in the world to have such a good man in my life.</p><p>And even if I had to share him with fifty-thousand screaming fans, he was all mine.</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>Sex on a tour bus was impossible if you wanted privacy. It was easy, though, if you didn\u2019t. Rick climbed up into his bed every night with his headphones, pulled the curtain, and went to sleep, and even though we didn\u2019t get along very well, that kind of thawed me toward him a little. He had a wife and kid at home and he went to bed alone every night. I knew that couldn\u2019t be easy, given that there were hundreds\u2014literally, hundreds\u2014of girls who would have been happy to hop on the bus with him after the shower.</p><p>The groupies lined up near the backstage door, just to catch a glimpse of the band. It was Dale they were all after, of course. But he was taken. I thought it would be Terry who would benefit most from the groupie runoff. He wasn\u2019t conventionally handsome, but he was interesting-looking, and I could see how his white-blond spiky hair (peroxide in the sink, I discovered) could be appealing. And he did bring a few girls on the bus at first, but I think he must have either sworn off it or he just got bored, because he, too, started going to bed at night with his headphones, curtain drawn.</p><p>And headphones were necessary, because Eddie \u201cBear\u201d Allen was getting laid. Just the first two venues alone, one in Florida and the other in Georgia, I think he\u2019d had sex with more girls than he\u2019d ever been with in his lifetime. And I didn\u2019t quite know how it was happening, because our beds were pretty small. They were average twin size, pretty luxury for a bus, but Dale and I were used to a double. And Eddie? He was two-hundred-and-fifty pounds of man flesh. It defied the laws of physics.</p><p>Granted, the girls he was bringing back were model skinny\u2014he\u2019d discovered he could pick them out in the crowd and one of the crew would give the girls he liked a backstage pass. Of course, Eddie was behind the drums for the whole set, so he scoped them out before the show. His tastes seemed to trend toward those toothpick girls with long limbs and jutting hipbones. From the sounds coming from his cubby\u2014and we\u2019d all quickly learned from experience to avoid the bus right after the show\u2014the girls were all having a good time. I was afraid he was going to hurt one of them\u2014not on purpose or anything, but they were so little and he was so big, and our beds were kind of high up.</p><p>Mostly the girls would leave after the sex, but he picked up a girl in South Carolina during our fourth show on the road who just stayed. I didn\u2019t know what her name was but Bear called her Pixie, which could have been reference to her stature\u2014probably not quite five feet\u2014or her short, dark haircut. Or maybe it was her real name, who knew? Pixie made it clear she was available to all the guys, if they wanted her. Especially Dale. When he told me that, I made sure I had a little talk with Pixie when none of the guys were around. After that, she didn\u2019t talk to Dale much and me not at all. Which was fine by me.</p> <p>But I admit, I was a little shocked when Pixie would join Bear after every show on the bus. He continued to pick out girls\u2014he was like a kid set loose an ice cream store and he wanted to try every possible flavor\u2014and Pixie would just join the party. Sometime I woke up to go to the bathroom and I\u2019d find limbs poking every which way out of Bear\u2019s cubby, the sound of the big guy\u2019s snoring filling the bus.</p><p>Black Diamond had their own bus, thank goodness. I loved the crew\u2014they were great guys\u2014but I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to share close quarters with them. Of course, sharing close quarters with three band members who had mixed feelings about me wasn\u2019t that fun either. It\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d been worried about when I\u2019d expressed my reservations in the first place. I hadn\u2019t anticipated the sex.</p><p>When I asked Chelsea about the groupie-sex thing, she laughed. She said it was common practice on the road. She was surprised the rest of the guys weren\u2019t doing it too. Maybe they were taking Dale\u2019s lead, or maybe they were just too shy, given the close quarters. But Chelsea devoted one entire drawer in our little kitchenette to condoms. It was packed full of every size and flavor known to man.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you\u2019d be doing on the road if I wasn\u2019t here?\u201d I asked Dale one night after we\u2019d been treated to a particularly loud sexual symphony from across the aisle. I felt bad for Rick, because Bear was right next to him, just on the other side of a thin wall\u2014if you could call it a wall at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be sleeping with headphones on,\u201d Dale replied, kissing the side of my breast. We were all tangled up post coitus, having taken advantage of the noise across the aisle to drown us out while we were having sex. \u201cAnd jerking off, thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think about me when you jerk off?\u201d I smiled. That was a nice thought. \u201cNot all those women out there throwing their panties on stage?\u201d</p><p>And here I\u2019d believed that was just a metaphor.</p><p>Silly me.</p> <p>Bear had actually started a collection.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I can barely concentrate on anything else when you\u2019re with me,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling my breast. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not? I can\u2019t think about anything but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no Pixies for you, even if I\u2019m not on the tour?\u201d I eyed him, only slightly doubtful.</p><p>\u201cNo Pixies for me.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBesides, she scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s only this big.\u201d I held up my thumb and forefinger and he eyed the space between.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but didn\u2019t you hear her yelling at Bear backstage?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Dale treated me to the gossip\u2014Pixie went off on him for taking a girl back to the bus alone. All by himself. No Pixie invited. That, apparently, hadn\u2019t gone over well. But from the sounds across the way, they\u2019d made up\u2014I knew the high-pitched sound of Pixie\u2019s climax and hadn\u2019t heard any other girl\u2019s voice.</p><p>While I\u2019d been thinking about Pixie and Bear, Dale drifted off, his breathing deep and even. I watched him sleep for a while, thankful things seemed to have quieted down over there. There was about a fifteen minute respite and then came the sound of Bear snoring. I was used to it by now and could sleep through it, but for some reason I felt wakeful.</p><p>Tomorrow was our first show in New York. Finally, home. We had worked our way up the coast, getting closer and closer. We played a lot of shows in New York, so there would be time to visit. I was looking forward to seeing John\u2014even if I dreaded facing Chrissy. And I was desperate to see Aimee and how big her belly was getting!</p><p>But I was worried about Ben. I\u2019d left things... well, I\u2019d just left them. And I hadn\u2019t called to talk to him either. Somehow he got Chelsea\u2019s number\u2014the man would have made a great private investigator. Or con man, Dale said. Chelsea was the only one with a mobile phone so we relied on her for communication. That was the number John had in case of emergencies. I gave it to Aimee so she could call if something happened\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even say \u201cwith the baby,\u201d out loud. Dale\u2019s manager, Greg, had called on it several times to talk to Dale and the band to check on him and see how the tour was going.</p><p>The first time she told me someone named Ben called for me, I froze. Dale explained who he was while I ran to the back of the bus to the bathroom. I\u2019d just shut the door and locked it and sat there, shaking. I knew I had to face it\u2014him\u2014eventually. I was so afraid he was going to try to manipulate me again. How could I trust him now?</p><p>Just thinking about it made me cry. It was better not to think about it. So I told Chelsea if he called again, I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. She did as I asked, but she continued to tell me every time he called\u2014and he called often, usually at least once a week\u2014giving me a long, steady look, like she expected something from me. I would just say, \u201cOkay, thanks,\u201d and leave it at that. But she looked at me like she didn\u2019t want to leave it.</p><p>I liked Chelsea\u2014everyone liked Chelsea\u2014but I hated when she looked at me like that.</p><p>I glanced over at the map I\u2019d tacked up to the wall, tracing our route from Florida. Time was strange on the road, and everything blended all together. The venues were all the same, big stadiums, big speakers, big crowds. But for the band, it was like living in a tunnel. They were herded from place to place, down hallways, sitting backstage, waiting for the lights to go down.</p><p>It was, surprisingly, a lot of waiting. You would have thought it would be far more exciting. These were big rock stars\u2014or, at least, they were on their way to becoming big rock stars\u2014where was the booze, the drugs, the girls? Well\u2014Bear had the girls covered. And there was booze, and they did get drunk a few times after the show, but it wasn\u2019t a constant or even a usual thing. Drugs I never saw\u2014although I did hear Chelsea tell Dale once they were available upon request.</p><p>The best part of being on the road, for me, besides being with Dale, which was a given, was having front row seats to every show. And it never got old. I asked Dale if he ever got bored, playing the same songs over and over every night and he looked at me like I\u2019d just sprouted three heads and was speaking Latin. I\u2019d only asked because you would think it would get boring\u2014but it didn\u2019t. The time between shows got boring sometimes, but never the shows themselves. They were the whole reason for all the miles, all the tunnels, all the hotels, all the waiting. The shows and the fans. And as excited as I knew the fans were\u2014I remembered being one\u2014for the guys in Black Diamond, it was like Christmas every night they got to go on stage.</p><p>New York was no exception, although there was a little more excitement in the air because for most of us, this was home\u2014or close enough to it. I woke up tired to the sound of Chelsea\u2019s voice as she opened the door and stuck her head into the bus. We\u2019d been rolling the last time I remembered, the miles ticking by on smooth asphalt in the dark, the wheels on the bus, round and round like that kids\u2019 song, a lullaby that finally put me to sleep.</p><p>Dale was gone\u2014so it was already a bad day. He\u2019d taken to waking up early on the road, putting on a pair of headphones, strapping on his walkman, and going for a run. He\u2019d never been a runner before, but he said it cleared his head in the morning. And that was a new thing too. Dale was not a morning guy. He and sunshine didn\u2019t get along.</p><p>\u201cTeam meeting in half an hour!\u201d Chelsea called. \u201cRise and shine, gentlemen and ladies! Whatever it was, you\u2019ve had enough time to sleep it off, if not, too bad. This is your only notice before I come in with a bowl of ice water!\u201d</p><p>I put my head back down on the pillow, looking at my little map and thinking about Dale. We spent most of our time together, except when he was on stage. Even during radio interviews, I went with him and watched. I couldn\u2019t begrudge him time alone. I just hated it because I didn\u2019t like being alone with my own thoughts. But that was my problem, not his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heard Pixie and Bear talking. Someone was in the bathroom\u2014likely Rick, who liked to shower before everyone. Terry and his smoker\u2019s cough were awake. I closed my eyes and drifted back to sleep. I had plenty I didn\u2019t want to think about when I was conscious\u2014and I did a pretty good job of avoiding it too. But my subconscious didn\u2019t play by the rules.</p><p>I woke up from a dream, screaming.</p><p>In the dream, the stepbeast had found me. He\u2019d kidnapped me, duct taping my hands together, feet too. At first I was in the trunk of a car. Then he took me out and I could breathe. It felt so good to suck in the night air, even if the piece of duct tape he tore off my mouth hurt like hell. In the dream, I was crying, begging him. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just kicked me and I fell. Like Alice down a hole, I fell and fell and then THUD, I hit the ground. Then he was filling the hole with dirt. He was burying me alive. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>When I woke up in the enclosed space of our little bed, I screamed. For a minute I couldn\u2019t tell what was dream and what was reality. And everyone came running. Pixie got there first, yanking my curtain aside, her dark eyes wide. I grabbed the blanket, pulling it up to my chin. I didn\u2019t usually sleep naked, but last night, after sex, I hadn\u2019t put my t-shirt back on. I hadn\u2019t wanted to disturb Dale.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Pixie asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone being murdered in here?\u201d Chelsea. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSara,\u201d Bear told her.</p><p>\u201cBad dream,\u201d I whispered, swallowing hard as more people appeared. Chelsea and Bear, frowning and looking in at me. Rick, his hair wet, appearing on the other side. Then Terry with his morning cigarette, blowing smoke out the side of his mouth. The gang was all there. Except Dale\u2014and he was the one I wanted.</p><p>\u201cJust a bad dream.\u201d My voice was stronger now. The dream was fading. \u201cSorry guys.\u201d</p> <p>That was our excitement for the morning.</p><p>I went to take a shower. I\u2019d seen the inside of Dark Wing\u2019s tour bus and it was far more luxurious than ours\u2014but for a bus, I couldn\u2019t complain. Our shower door was glass and there was a massaging showerhead. I washed my hair, massaging my scalp like I could scrub the dream out of my head. It mostly worked. By the time I was out, dried off and dressed, most of the dream had dissipated, leaving only a lingering feeling of dread.</p><p>The crew meeting assembled outside. The busses parked together, configuring a large square in the middle, leaving only a narrow space in or out\u2014Bear had to squeeze\u2014guarded by security. Sure, a fan could slip underneath one of the busses, but we were in a segregated parking lot on venue property. They\u2019d have a hard time finding us in the first place. They stayed that way until we had to leave and we could go hang in the square\u2014we called it the square\u2014whenever we felt like some down time outside without any danger of being swarmed by a mass of fans. It was quite ingenious really, the busses all snuggled up like that. It gave us all a sense or feeling of safety, and I think Chelsea knew it.</p><p>She was one smart cookie.</p><p>Dale squeezed in just as the meeting was starting. We made a big circle, either standing or sitting, while Chelsea went over the day\u2019s schedule and plan. Dark Wing didn\u2019t have to attend morning meetings. Technically, the opening band didn\u2019t either, but we spent so much more time with the crew, we kind of felt like one big family, so we went.</p><p>I spotted Dale sneaking around the circle, making his way toward me. He wrapped his arms around me from behind. I could smell him, that musky scent of sweat, and it reminded me of the night before. His shirt was damp and I could hear Nirvana still playing over his headphones. They were down around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cSome day we\u2019re going to be in the big bus,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our own private jet. We won\u2019t have to listen to Bear getting laid.\u201d</p><p>I giggled at that, then sobered quickly when Chelsea glanced my way.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have to attend meetings.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, whispering back, \u201cI kind of like the meetings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeirdo.\u201d He pulled my hair aside, nuzzling the back of my neck. \u201cI heard you had a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. News traveled fast!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to tell me?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, shushing him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell all of us?\u201d Chelsea snapped. I loved Chelsea, but when she got mad, she took you down. There was no warning and no wiggle room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d I flushed, elbowing Dale in the gut, hearing him go \u201coof!\u201d I waved at her. \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She eyed me for a minute then shook her head, looking back at her notes.</p><p>Dale was laughing. I couldn\u2019t hear but I could feel it. I went to elbow him again and he grabbed my arm. I tried to jerk it away but he had too good of a hold. And before I knew it, he\u2019d leaned in and hefted me over his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I hissed, still being quiet, like the whole damned crew\u2014not to mention the band\u2014wasn\u2019t watching and cracking up.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d Chelsea had reading glasses on and they made her look older. She pulled them down to look over at them at Dale carrying me around the outside of the circle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take her back to the bus and fuck her brains out. Okay with you?\u201d</p><p>Oh he was going to get it. I beat on his back with my fists but he acted like it was nothing. The entire crew was laughing and they started making remarks, giving Dale advice on how to get the job done right.</p><p>\u201cWhatever floats your boat.\u201d Chelsea shook her head, but she was smiling as she went back to her notes. Dale carried me through the narrow way\u2014barely squeezing through.</p><p>\u201cI am going to kill you when you put me down,\u201d I informed him through clenched teeth as he headed toward our bus.</p><p>\u201cGuess I better never put you down then,\u201d he made an about-face, heading the other way.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I better keep moving.\u201d He started forward and I howled. He stopped again and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bus.\u201d The words were barely audible.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bus! The bus! Okay, let\u2019s go back to the bus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d he asked, sounding genuinely curious.</p><p>Two could play this game. \u201cI\u2019m going to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to unzip your jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m liking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd take out your cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd run my tongue allll around the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. Getting hard to walk here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good if I fall and take you with me.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat just means I get your cock in my mouth sooner.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI should have gone the short way.\u201d</p><p>He was at a light jog now.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me wet just thinking about your cock in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s why I was giving Dale a blowjob when Chelsea was telling the crowd she had the night off. If she\u2019d been there, I don\u2019t think what happened would have happened at all. But I was oblivious, and Dale, who made sure, unbeknownst to me, that Chelsea knew everything\u2014everything\u2014about us she needed to in order to keep us, and especially me, safe, was reaching climax just around the time the meeting broke up.</p><p>So neither of us knew Chelsea had the night off, which under normal circumstances wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. But we were in New York, near home, near family and friends, people who knew us, some who loved us\u2014and some who hated us. I think we both thought we were safe. We had layers and layers of safety nets in place. Chelsea was just one of them\u2014but she was the most important, I think. When she was gone, it created a huge hole.</p><p>But we didn\u2019t know.</p><p>We spent the day like any other day on tour. Tomorrow we would go back to New Jersey and visit. I\u2019d talked to John and Aimee the day before to make plans. I was excited for the New York show\u2014\u201chome town\u201d shows were always the best. And I would be there, front and center. Until then we waited. Our morning sexcapade started at the front of the bus, christening the dining table and our sitting area before ending up in the bathroom. But even that only shaved an hour off our waiting time. We took a nap. We listened to music. We watched Bear and Pixie play a mean game of chess. And we waited.</p><p>We went on like it was any other day because we thought we were safe. We\u2019d built walls around us, a fortress. We were untouchable. Like the illusion of the busses making the square, we were in a place we could gather and let our guard down.</p><p>We let our guard down, trusting the circle to hold, and we didn\u2019t know it until it was too late. Someone had been waiting for us to come home.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>It was two hours before the first New York show when Greg Richer called to tell us the news .We were backstage, waiting, as usual. I was sitting on one of the sofas reading a well-worn copy of Pride and Prejudice I found on a shelf marked \u201cFree Library.\u201d It was a meager collection, ten or twelve classics, a few self-help books and two copies of Moonwalk, Michael Jackson\u2019s autobiography, which had received a lot of press the year before. Now they were apparently giving away copies.</p><p>Dale had his head in my lap and he was playing Tetris on his new Gameboy. All the band members got one as soon as they came out, a nice perk, a gift from one of the venues. I think it was in Georgia\u2014or maybe Virginia. The boys loved them and played them constantly. I tried a few times but they made my eyes feel buggy and gave me a headache.</p><p>Chelsea came into the room, waving her mobile phone over her head. If it didn\u2019t have an antennae attached, I would swear she looked like she was going to throw a brick at someone\u2019s head when she did that. It would be one more hour before Chelsea left for her much deserved two days off, but no one mentioned it. I had no idea, and Dale later said</p><p>\u201cGot Greg on the phone, guys! He\u2019s on speaker!\u201d She hit a button on the phone and then said, \u201cGo ahead, Greg. I\u2019ve got them all rounded up for you.\u201d</p><p>We were all there. Bear and Pixie were in the corner playing chess. Rick was on the other sofa, a ball cap pulled low on his head, napping. Terry was methodically removing the tabs off all of the empty soda cans and stacking them in a pyramid on the counter.</p><p>\u201cHey Black Diamond!\u201d Greg called.</p><p>\u201cHi Greg,\u201d we chorused, almost in sync.</p><p>\u201cGot great news for you boys. I Will Always Come For You went double platinum this week.\u201d</p><p>Dale sat bolt upright, staring the phone like it was an alien. Terry was so surprised he knocked over his entire soda can pyramid and they clanked to the tile floor, scattering everywhere. Rick sat up, gaping in Chelsea\u2019s direction, cap in hand. Only Bear didn\u2019t react. He was concentrating on the chess board.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more!\u201d Greg sounded positively gleeful. Maybe he was in the market for a new Porsche and was wondering if he could buy it with his twenty percent. \u201cYour album, Black Diamond, has gone platinum.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The boys were on their feet, whooping and hollering. Dale jumped up onto the coffee table and did a dive onto the other couch, flopping on it like a fish. Terry and Rick high-fived and danced around in the midst of the empty soda cans, making a huge racket.</p><p>\u201cHow many is that?\u201d I asked\u2014yelled, really. I couldn\u2019t hear over the noise.</p><p>Chelsea came closer, grinning. \u201cAsk him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many is that?\u201d I yelled into the receiver.</p> <p>\u201cPlatinum is a million!\u201d Greg\u2019s voice crackled through the speaker. \u201cDouble platinum is two million.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing I was still sitting down. I think I would have fallen down if I hadn\u2019t been. Dale jumped from his sofa to my sofa and then pounced on me like a cat. I laughed and he kissed me all over my face and then, just for good measure, licked me too, right up the side of my cheek.</p><p>\u201cEwww!\u201d I wiped my cheek with the end of my t-shirt\u2014I always wore Black Diamond t-shirts on concert days, and it was a double bonus, because I was also advertising my own art work at the same time.</p><p>\u201cShamu kiss!\u201d Dale called, doing it again, this time on the other cheek.</p><p>Chelsea was laughing, sandwiched between Terry and Rick jumping up and down and trying to kiss her, holding out the phone.</p> <p>\u201cDale!\u201d she called. \u201cHe wants to talk to you!\u201d</p><p>Dale grabbed the phone, turning it off speaker and flopping down on the other couch, on his back.</p><p>\u201cHey Greg, my main man, my favorite man in the whole damned world, whattya say?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, turning around to look at Bear and Pixie, still involved in their chess game.</p><p>\u201cHey, didn\u2019t you hear?\u201d I called over.</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d Bear moved his knight, glancing up at me. \u201cAwesome.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, shaking my head. Dale always said, \u201cDrummers are weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need beer!\u201d Terry told Chelsea. \u201cLots of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd champagne!\u201d called Pixie.</p><p>\u201cYour wish is my command!\u201d Chelsea laughed, going over to the couch and holding out her hand. \u201cMy phone, rock star, I need my phone.\u201d</p><p>Dale sat up, handing it over. His mood had shifted completely but no one else noticed except me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I went over to him on the couch.</p><p>\u201cTell you later.\u201d He shook his head, watching the rest of the band laughing, celebrating. Bear had finally come over to join in, having captured Pixie\u2019s queen. Something was wrong\u2014Dale smiled and joined them. He even popped the top on the champagne and proceeded to pour the foam all over Bear\u2019s head\u2014which, of course, necessitated a wardrobe change for my most difficult to dress band member! Dale looked fine on the surface\u2014but I just knew something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>I tried to get him alone before the show, but it was impossible. Word spread like wildfire and all five of the members of Dark Wing came over to congratulate us and talk about their first album\u2014back in 1972\u2014to earn platinum status. By the time all the hugs and congratulations were over, it was time for the opening act to go onstage. I kissed Dale for luck\u2014he grabbed me and hugged me close at the last minute.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked, searching his eyes. He smiled and nodded but I knew better.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to miss any of their act, but I wanted to find Chelsea and ask if we could arrange some sort of celebration for after the show on short notice. Dale was upset about something Greg had said\u2014but whatever it was couldn\u2019t possibly kill the joy of hitting platinum\u2014and double platinum!</p><p>I saw one of the crew\u2014I couldn\u2019t remember his name although I was racking my brain\u2014and stopped to ask if he\u2019d seen Chelsea, but he gave me a message first.</p><p>\u201cHey, Carl was looking for you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. Carl was Chelsea\u2019s second in command.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where he went?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSupply room.\u201d He pointed to a door across the hall.</p><p>I went over and knocked gently, waiting for an answer. I didn\u2019t get one, so I cautiously opened the door. There were shelves inside loaded with all sorts of paper products from cups and plates to toilet paper for the bathrooms.</p><p>\u201cCarl?\u201d I called.</p><p>He came around the corner so fast he scared me. He didn\u2019t see me at first. He was mumbling to himself.</p><p>\u201cOut of\u2014\u201d He stopped at the door and looked at me, blinking. \u201cSara! I have a message for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He dug into his jeans pocket, bringing out a piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He slid by me and started heading down the hall.</p><p>I looked at the slip of paper. It was from a pink message pad with a space for To and From, Time, Date and all that, but someone had ignored the boxes and had written, \u201cSara\u2014your dad is waiting for you in the square.\u201d</p><p>Ben.</p><p>He was the only one I hadn\u2019t called. But of course he knew we were in town. I remembered the way Chelsea had looked at me every time I told her to refuse a phone call from him. Had she given the note to Carl? I wasn\u2019t sure, but I thought it might be her handwriting. I looked up to ask, but Carl was long gone.</p><p>I knew Chelsea wouldn\u2019t let anyone into the square that she didn\u2019t know. She\u2019d been briefed\u2014Dale had made it very clear who we would and would not see. Of course, Ben was on that list. But she\u2019d decided, because she didn\u2019t like my choice to ignore him, to let him in? When I found her, I was going to kill her.</p><p>Damnit. I heard Black Diamond going into their second song\u2014Bonnie and Clyde\u2014I could just pretend I hadn\u2019t gotten the message. But I had a feeling, if I didn\u2019t meet him, he\u2019d coming looking for me anyway. And I didn\u2019t want to make a big scene in front of everyone, especially not tonight. I\u2019d go meet him privately, listen to what he had to say, and escort him out to security before Dale ever even knew he was here.</p><p>I started down the hallway, headed toward the back of the stadium. The tour busses were parked way in back. The halls were a maze. I kept an eye out for Chelsea but I only saw crew members\u2014identified by the crew silkscreened across the back of their shirts. I got turned around three times and had to ask the crew which way toward the back door. There was more than one, of course, in an amphitheater this big, but I just needed one of them.</p><p>I felt like Alice lost in the Queen of Hearts\u2019 hedges. I was finally ready to give up\u2014Black Diamond was likely done with their set by now!\u2014when I turned the corner and found the door. Actually, I found the loading area where big trucks made their deliveries. Those doors were huge, like giant garage doors, and it just reinforced the Alice theme running in my head. Had I shrunk? But no, there was a nice human-sized door on my left and I pushed it open, triumphant.</p><p>Spending all day inside made my eyes reluctant to adjust to outside light. It was dusk, a rosy hue on the horizon over the trees. The parking lot was half-filled with cars. This was where the amphitheater staff parked\u2014the ticket takers and concession workers and janitors. Our tour busses were at the very back. I had to walk all away across the lot.</p><p>It gave me time to think of what to say. I found myself walking slower and slower as I neared the parked busses. The sun was really almost gone now and I hadn\u2019t brought a flashlight. Well, I\u2019d just take Ben onto the bus and we would talk there. The keys were in the visor\u2014no one could get back here to steal them, and if they did, how in the world could they get out with one?</p><p>I ran my hand along the side of our bus as I came up to the passageway into the square on my left. I made the turn, taking the narrow way through, remembering with a smile how Dale had carried me out and had his way with me. And vice versa. Platinum. Double platinum! I was still so excited I could hardly contain it. I couldn\u2019t wait until after the show so we could really celebrate.</p><p>Maybe I would even let Ben stay. Time had softened my heart a little. Not much, but a little bit. I had so many questions, but I was afraid of the answers. And worse\u2014I was afraid of the lies. Could I trust anything he said? I was doubtful.</p><p>I blinked in the low light, looking for someone, anyone. The bus lights were dark. There was no one here, of course. The band was on stage and the crew was too.</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d</p><p>I froze. The voice came from my left and I knew it instantly. I turned and ran. If I hadn\u2019t put my hair up that morning\u2014I was too tired and it was too late in the day to fix it up by the time Dale and I were done in the shower\u2014if I hadn\u2019t had a nice, neat little handle on the back of my goddamned head, I would have been free.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, little girl?\u201d</p><p>I screamed. The stepbeast had me by my hair, pulling me back, dragging me back, because I was clinging to the front of the bus, looking for hand holds. I had my fingers hooked into one of the recesses for the lights for a moment before he yanked me free and I stumbled back into the square.</p><p>The first blow hit me like a memory. I don\u2019t think I even felt it, but I tasted blood. I just knew I had to scream and kick and fight for my life to get out of his grip. I didn\u2019t have time and I knew it. If he got me down, I knew I\u2019d never get up again. I screamed for help, I screamed for Dale, I screamed and lashed out with every limb, gouging his skin with my nails every time I came in contact with it. In the end, he was just too strong. He overpowered me, forcing me to the asphalt.</p><p>I had absorbed most of the fall with my hip and I struggled to stay on my back instead of letting him roll me to my stomach. His full weight was on me and he panted with the effort, grabbing my arms by the wrists and pinning them over my head. His face hovered over mine in the dark. I smelled his fetid breath, cigarettes and beer and a wasted life.</p><p>\u201cListen here, bitch.\u201d He spat the last word, spraying spittle on my cheek. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a little fun before we say goodbye. We can do this easy or we can do it hard. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>How old had I been the first time? I was still a virgin, certainly. I remember that much, having to throw away the bloody sheets I couldn\u2019t get clean. I washed and washed and washed them like Lady Macbeth, but the blood never did come out and my mother complained about my missing sheets for a month.</p><p>We can do this easy or we can do it hard. It\u2019s up to you.</p><p>When I finally, tearfully confessed to Dr. Jarvis\u2014it was probably six months or more before I admitted the truth\u2014it was my fault, really. He had given me the choice and I had chosen the easy path. Two roads diverged and I let my stepfather rape me. Dr. Jarvis didn\u2019t placate me. He didn\u2019t tell me it wasn\u2019t my fault. He asked me a question.</p><p>What do you think your stepfather would have done if you\u2019d put up a fight?</p><p>And I sat with the question a long time.</p><p>He would have raped me anyway.</p><p>But wasn\u2019t it still at least, a little, partially my fault?</p><p>If I had fought, if I had screamed, if I had run away...</p><p>And then Dr. Jarvis had said something that changed my life.</p><p>Let\u2019s take emotion out of it for a moment. Let\u2019s say we\u2019re doing an experiment. I want to cut the tail off a mouse. Yes, I know, it\u2019s horrible to think about. But this is our experiment. This is our goal. Our aim. Our objective is to cut the tail off this mouse. What can the mouse do to stop it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Run away.

So I say to this mouse, Mouse, you have a choice. You can either sit and be quiet and calm while I cut off your tail, or you can struggle and fight me and perhaps hurt yourself or someone else in the process, while I cut off your tail. Which will you choose, Mouse?</p><p>Do you see, Sara?</p><p>I\u2019m the mouse.</p> <p>Is that all you see? What was your stepfather\u2019s aim?</p><p>He wanted to rape me.</p><p>Yes. Now why did he want to rape you?</p><p>I don\u2019t know! What kind of question is that?</p><p>Why would anyone cut the tail off a mouse?</p> <p>Because they\u2019re sick and twisted! Because watching something suffer because its smaller and weaker than they are... makes them feel... powerful. In control.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The stepbeast felt me relenting, giving in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d I heard the grin his voice. He wins. The house always wins.</p><p>I looked up, past him, and saw the stars, a full moon. I heard the sound of his buckle, his zipper. It was like a dream, just a dream.</p><p>I\u2019m the mouse. Where\u2019s my tail? I\u2019m the mouse. Three blind mice. I\u2019m the mouse. He chopped off the tail with a carving knife. No it was the butcher\u2019s wife. Mommy it hurts. I can\u2019t see, it\u2019s dark. Mommy where are you going? Going? Gone? Three blind mice. See how they run. See how they...</p> <p>Run!</p><p>He was too heavy. I whimpered and turned my head as he struggled with my jeans, the snap, the zipper. This wasn\u2019t happening. I was floating away, going, going. I closed my eyes and was blind. Sound receded. He swore and yanked at my jeans, still on top of me, weighing me down.</p><p>I flashed on my dream from that morning and a jolt went through me. He was burying me. Burying me alive. Because I was... I was...</p><p>Alive!</p><p>I didn\u2019t scream. I didn\u2019t cry or beg or make any sound at all.</p><p>I watched him kneel up and straddle my thigh, the shape of his head blotting out the rising moon. He was determined to take off my jeans and have his way. And then he would finish the job he started two years before.</p><p>\u201cLittle help here, Sara?\u201d He yanked one side, then the other, down my hips.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I brought my knee up\u2014the one he was straddling, as hard as I could.</p> <p>The stepbeast howled. He grabbed for his crotch but I did it again before he could cover up. He howled some more, swearing, calling me names, but I couldn\u2019t hear him. The drumbeat of my own heart was too loud in my ears. He grabbed for me with his other hand, catching hold of my wrist, but with only one limb in his grasp and an aching crotch to cover, he wasn\u2019t strong enough to hold me. Maybe he never had been.</p><p>He teetered, still groaning, and I knew if he fell my direction, it was over.</p><p>I rolled right on the asphalt, scrambling to my feet and breaking into a run, pulling my jeans up my hips as I went/</p><p>\u201cGet back here right now!\u201d</p><p>I almost stopped. I\u2019d been so conditioned once upon a time that some part of me insisted I scurry back. I\u2019m not that mouse anymore. I heard him coming after me, the shuffle and grunt. He\u2019d put on weight in jail. I glanced behind me to see him gaining. Whatever painful impact I\u2019d had on his crotch was clearly fading enough for him to give chase.</p><p>And the entrance to the square was behind me. Behind him.</p><p>I\u2019d run in the wrong direction.</p><p>\u201cSara!\u201d he called, coming faster now. \u201cGet back here right now!\u201d</p><p>I was trapped in the corner made by two giant tour busses. I could continue to run around the maze, double back, head for the exit.</p><p>\u201cSara!\u201d</p><p>Or I could stay right here and wait for the end.</p><p>\u201cSara! Sara!\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the stepbeast calling.</p><p>\u201cDale?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>The stepbeast grabbed my wrist in his fist, turning me around to face him and slamming me against the side of the bus. The back of my head hit the metal and I winced. I saw his face in the moonlight, the sideways sneer, his eyes glinting. He had something in his other hand. That glinted too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing.\u201d I sneered right back at him with pure disgust. \u201cLess than nothing,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never again.\u201d</p><p>I twisted my wrist out of his hand like I\u2019d been taught in the self-defense class Dale had made me take\u2014toward the thumb. I was free, just for an instant. I saw the anger and something else\u2014fear?\u2014in his eyes. I knew he was going to kill me then. I saw the knife come up, just a glint in the moonlight.</p><p>I dropped flat to the ground, scraping my palms on the asphalt, and rolled. The tour busses that created the square were big, boxy vehicles. They had to be, with everything the designers wanted to cram into them. When I\u2019d joked about fans sneaking under the busses, we all laughed, because there wasn\u2019t much room underneath, maybe ten, twelve inches at the outside edge. It would have to be a very small fan.</p><p>Or a mouse.</p><p>I shimmied my way under as fast as I could. It wasn\u2019t quite fast enough. He grabbed my leg, pulling hard. I screamed, trapped.</p><p>\u201cSara! Sara!\u201d</p><p>They were calling my name. Someone was calling my name. Dale?</p><p>\u201cNooo!\u201d I grabbed onto something over my head, cold metal in the dark. I could smell a mix of motor oil and dirt. I pulled and twisted and felt him lose his grip, just for an instant. I jerked my leg back and felt my shoe slip off.</p><p>I was free!</p><p>There was more room toward the middle of the bus. I wiggled and squirmed my way across the asphalt on my belly, cursing the obscene width of the tour bus. It felt like I was crawling behind enemy lines.</p><p>\u201cSara!\u201d It was Dale. Close!</p><p>\u201cDale!\u201d I gasped. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>I slithered out from under the other side of the bus, hearing footsteps on the pavement. I stopped, still panting with the effort, seeing at least a dozen flashlights heading toward the square. I couldn\u2019t see who was behind them in the dark, but I could hear them all, calling my name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d I stood, wobbly. \u201cHelp! I\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>I leaned against the bus, my head aching, trying to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d Dale, panting too from his run across the parking lot. He grabbed me and hugged me so tight I could barely breathe. \u201cCarl told me about the note. I thought... Are you okay? Was it Ben?\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d had the same thought. Because the other one was so impossible it wouldn\u2019t compute. Why would he do something so risky? He was on parole. He knew he\u2019d go back to jail if he got caught. But the stepbeast thought he was too big for consequences. And that was exactly why he\u2019d come after me, I realized. I was the only person alive who had \u201cbested\u201d him and he couldn\u2019t stand that. He\u2019d only spent two years in jail, but I was sure he\u2019d spent them angry, planning ways to pay me back for what I\u2019d done to him.</p><p>What I\u2019d done to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d I managed to croak. \u201cIt\u2019s the stepbeast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamnit!\u201d Dale\u2019s arms tightened around me. \u201cSara, why did you go!\u201d</p><p>I heard people on the other side of the bus. Shouts, footfalls.</p><p>Someone called out, \u201cI got him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was Ben.\u201d I sobbed against his chest.</p><p>The rest of the band had caught up, all of them out of breath, several of the crew too, all asking if I was okay.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still in there!\u201d I cried through my tears.</p><p>Or, maybe he wasn\u2019t. It was likely he slipped out and away during all the commotion. The thought of him out there somewhere, still. He would come for me. He did it once, he\u2019d do it again. He would come for me until it was over. Until I was dead. Game over, he wins.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dale murmured against my aching head. In the distance I saw the yellow lights of campus security, and behind that, some flashing reds and blues. \u201cThey got him:\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? What?\u201d Nothing was making sense.</p><p>\u201cI got him!\u201d I heard someone banging against the other side of the bus.</p><p>\u201cWe got him!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice from the other side too. I wiggled out of Dale\u2019s arms, grabbing his flashlight and crouching down.</p><p>\u201cHi Pixie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got him.\u201d She flashed me a smile. \u201cBear told him he should pick on someone his own size.\u201d</p><p>It was incredible, but that made me laugh.</p><p>\u201cBear?\u201d I looked up at Dale as we started to walk around the tour busses to the entrance.</p><p>\u201cI called the cops first and had Carl tell security you were missing, I told everybody we needed to come look for you,\u201d Dale explained. \u201cBear didn\u2019t feel like walking so he, uh... borrowed a vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you \u2018borrow\u2019 one?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to hotwire a car,\u201d he snapped, adding glumly, \u201cAnd they\u2019d already left.\u201d</p><p>Bear ended up being my bumbling knight in shining armor, much to Dale\u2019s chagrin. When I asked where the handcuffs came from, Pixie just grinned and dropped me a wink. Seeing the stepbeast belly down on the asphalt, hands bound behind him, made me feel a little better, but I still kept my distance.</p><p>The cops had a lot of questions but once they ran the record on Pete Holmes, they stopped asking so many and put him in the back of their police cruiser before they did. Chelsea showed up in formal eveningwear, her hair piled up. She\u2019d had a date for the theater and when Carl called to tell her\u2014she wouldn\u2019t go anywhere without her mobile phone wedged into her purse\u2014she rushed back. She couldn\u2019t stop apologizing and I kept telling her it wasn\u2019t her fault.</p><p>We couldn\u2019t trace exactly where the communication had all broken down, but the stepbeast knew my full name, he had pictures of me in his wallet, and with that, he somehow had said the right things to the right people and had been taken back to the square to wait for me. It must have seemed easy to him at the time\u2014and it was. It made me realize how close we are, all the time, to our world turning completely upside down.</p><p>By the time it was all over and Dale had tucked me into bed beside him, I was so exhausted I could barely move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThis should have been your night. Double platinum!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He spooned up against me. \u201cYou\u2019re safe, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>I was drifting off. I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open. Then I remembered.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Greg say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He squeezed his arm around my waist. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sleep if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to sleep if I do tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d I rolled toward him in the dark. \u201cWhat? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>He siged. \u201cGreg got a call from the New York Daily News asking if he had any opinion on the rumor that Tyler Vincent is Dale Diamond\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re running it in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s... who\u2019s their source?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Once it\u2019s out there... it\u2019s out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Dale was quiet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou know, yesterday, if Greg had told me that, I would have thought it was the end of the world,\u201d he said softly, stroking my cheek in the dark. It hurt a little\u2014it was the one the stepbeast had backhanded me across. But I didn\u2019t tale Dale that.</p> <p>\u201cNow...\u201d He kissed me, soft, slow, sweet. \u201cMy world is very small. Everything else can fall away. You\u2019re all that matters.\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly how he felt.</p><p>Dale said we wouldn\u2019t sleep, but we did, wrapped up in each other, both of us holding on to the one thing that mattered\u2014each other.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>The news was out by the time the car dropped us at home.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, son.\u201d John hugged Dale the minute we got in the door. \u201cI called Tyler, left him a message. We\u2019ll straighten this out. What a mess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d Dale met my eyes over John\u2019s shoulder. So sad. He\u2019d done everything he could to keep this secret from the man who raised him and now the whole world knew.</p><p>I hugged John tight and smiled when he kissed the top of my head and said, \u201cWelcome home.\u201d We\u2019d decided not to tell him about the stepbeast. Not now. Chelsea had talked to the cops and they all agreed it was best to keep Dale\u2019s name out of any reports. The story of the stepbeast\u2019s assault was fourth page news. Tyler Vincent and Dale Diamond, on the other hand, were front and center.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d John asked. \u201cI can make you something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPancakes?\u201d I asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He gave me a wink. \u201cGo put your stuff away. It will be good to have you home for a while.\u201d</p> <p>A whole week. And Black Diamond was still playing shows at night. Then the tour would move up the coast, through New Hampshire, ending in Maine. Dale carried his bag and mine up the stairs. I opened the door to his room and he dropped the bags on the floor, leaping onto the bed with a groan. I laughed and flopped next to him.</p><p>\u201cA real bed!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cOh bed, I missed you, bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to check the springs.\u201d Dale sat, bouncing a little. \u201cJust to make sure.\u201d</p><p>I wagged a finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi you guys.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at the open door, startled to see Chrissy standing there. I prepared myself for an onslaught.</p><p>Instead, she came in, shutting the door behind her, and said quietly, \u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Then she burst into tears. Dale looked at me, stunned. Then back at his sister. I just shrugged. I had no idea who this new Chrissy was or what she\u2019d done with the old one.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault,\u201d she said, coming over to sit on the bed. Dale moved, making room for her between us. \u201cBut I swear to God, I didn\u2019t know he was a reporter!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d met him at the mall. He seemed interested in Dale, wanted to talk about him a lot, but she figured he was just curious about her family. She claimed she was as surprised as anyone else when the story came out and she was listed as an \u201cunidentified source.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t mean it to come out. I thought he was just...interested...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was interested all right.\u201d Dale sighed, putting an arm around her shoulder. \u201cHey. Come on, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay.\u201d She leaned against him, shaking her head. \u201cTyler is going to do something... bad.\u201d</p><p>Dale snorted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said if it ever got out... he had a plan. Some sort of plan.\u201d She met her brother\u2019s eyes and she really looked scared. \u201cShe said it would ruin everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said that?\u201d Dale frowned, looking over at me. I shrugged. I didn\u2019t trust this new Chrissy\u2014if past behavior was any indication of future behavior, she was up to something.</p><p>\u201cShe said if I ever confronted him with the truth, he\u2019d do... something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething is pretty broad,\u201d I interjected.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you wanted him to... I don\u2019t know, say he was our dad, I guess,\u201d Dale said. \u201cBut he\u2019s got a life. He\u2019s got a family. He doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d Chrissy asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got Dad.\u201d Dale pointed at the door. I could already smell pancakes cooking. \u201cHe\u2019s not rich, he\u2019s not famous. He\u2019s just Dad. And if I had to choose between the two, I\u2019d choose Dad. He\u2019s the most honest, hardworking, generous man I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said softly, looking at the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve been kind of an awful brat to him.\u201d</p><p>Kind of?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another great thing about Dad,\u201d Dale said, squeezing her shoulder. \u201cHe forgives easy\u2014because he loves us. He really loves you, Chrissy. To him, you\u2019re his daughter. And for a long time, before we heard about Tyler Vincent, he was the only dad we knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to kill him,\u201d Chrissy whispered, tears in her eyes again. \u201cHe was talking all morning about how the paper got it wrong and how he and Tyler were going to clear this up. When Dad finds out he\u2019s not... not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Dale sighed. \u201cDamnit Chrissy, if you\u2019d just kept your mouth shut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u2018I\u2019m sorry for you too. They\u2019re saying maybe he had influence over the judges at Battle of the Bands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that was coming.\u201d Dale rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI could use a hand or two down here!\u201d John called from the bottom of the stairs. We all froze, hoping he hadn\u2019t heard much of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cBe right down,\u201d I called.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d Chrissy said again.</p><p>\u201cI know. Go on and help Dad. I want to put some of this away.\u201d He nodded at the bags he\u2019d brought up.</p><p>Chrissy went downstairs. Dale and I looked at each other. I was still so stunned I didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cChrissy apologized!\u201d I flopped back in the bed, staring at the ceiling</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Dale started putting some of his clothes back in his drawers. \u201cI think it\u2019s the first sign of revelations. Hey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I glanced over at him standing by the dresser.</p><p>\u201cDad put my mail up here.\u201d Dale came over to the bed, sitting next to me. \u201cThis is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked again, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cThe blood test. The DNA results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou open it.\u201d</p><p>Dale slid his finger under the edge, pulling out a piece of paper. I threw an arm over my eyes. He was so quiet for so long I had to peek out.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>Dale held the paper out to me.</p><p>\u201cWith ninety-nine percent accuracy,\u201d I read aloud. \u201cThis test concludes...\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Dale, my mouth dropping open.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I whispered. And that was really the question, for all of us.</p><p>What, exactly, did that mean?</p><p>I was going to call Ben. I really was. I was just planning out everything I was going to say in my head. And then he rang the doorbell in the middle of breakfast and John invited him in for pancakes.</p><p>The first thing he did was hug me. I was coming back from the refrigerator with the syrup John had forgotten. I looked up and there he was in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSara, my God, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d Ben hugged me tight. \u201cYou could have been killed!\u201d</p><p>So much for not telling John about what had happened with the stepbeast.</p><p>I had to sit down and tell the whole story over pancakes and everyone exclaimed how lucky I was to be alive. The phone rang and Chrissy was closest so she answered it.</p><p>\u201cYour manager?\u201d she said, holding the phone out to Dale.</p><p>He sighed, getting up from the table to talk. He stretched the cord all the way down the hall. We had finished off the last of the pancakes and John got up to the dishes. I started to get up to help clear but Chrissy interrupted me.</p><p>\u201cYou sit down,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI\u2019ll clear.\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her, too stunned to object.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I barged in like that,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI just saw the article and got really worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m okay,\u201d I assured him, wondering how he even found the article. It had been buried. \u201cBump on my head. Bloody lip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d been there.\u201d He shook his head, jaw tightening, a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou read the article in the paper?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, online.\u201d</p><p>When I gave him a puzzle look he laughed. \u201cI forgot, you don\u2019t have a computer. I\u2019m going to have to get you guys online. I find everything online. News, weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, umm...\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure now how to tell him. \u201cDale got something in the mail the other day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe DNA results?\u201d Ben smiled and winked. \u201cI got mine too. You\u2019re my girl.\u201d</p><p>I was surprised by his reaction, but in hindsight, it made sense. Of course he wasn\u2019t surprised. It just confirmed what he\u2019d been saying all along. So he was my father after all. My mother had lied to me. I could have known him my whole life, had some sort of relationship with him, and she had taken that away. But what kind of man was he? Maybe she had her reasons? Dale had been suspicious from the start\u2014but Dale was always suspicious when it came to \u201cother men\u201d in my life.</p><p>\u201cListen, Sara, I am so sorry about that investment thing.\u201d Ben sighed, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI know it scared you off and I didn\u2019t mean... I should have been more clear. I should have approached it differently. I just saw a great opportunity for you to invest in your future, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not even my company or my idea. I just happen to think it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it did put me off a little,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d He held up his hand.\u201dI had a lot of time to think about it when you didn\u2019t return my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. I... have a habit of avoiding confrontation if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame you for that.\u201d He reached out and tucked a piece of stray hair behind my ear. \u201cBut once I saw it from your perspective... ugh. I just show up out of nowhere after seeing your picture in the paper, you\u2019ve got this rich and famous boyfriend, and me, dummy that I am, I end up talking to you about this investment thing. I could kick myself.\u201d</p><p>I met his eyes, trying to determine if he was telling the truth. Or was this just more of some plan? It was like Chrissy\u2019s sudden turn of attitude. I didn\u2019t quite trust it.</p><p>\u201cCan you... can we just have a do-over? I promise not to be such an idiot this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, if you promise...\u201d I could give him another chance. There was no harm in that.</p><p>\u201cCross my heart.\u201d He did, which made me laugh.</p><p>Dale came back around the corner, slamming the phone down on the receiver.</p><p>\u201cUh oh, now what?\u201d I groaned. I couldn\u2019t stand one more thing.</p> <p>\u201cGreg says they\u2019re presenting us with our platinum album plaques today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, what a disaster.\u201d Chrissy rolled her eyes.</p><p>There was the Chrissy I remembered. I looked over at her and she grinned, shrugging one shoulder.</p><p>Dale ignored her. \u201cThey want the band there at four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d I made a face. \u201cWe had dinner plans with Aimee and Matt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. And the band\u2019s got a show at eight. He promised we were supposed to get a little break this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll just have to go,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not missing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d John asked, coming over, wiping his hands on a dish towel.</p><p>And of course John wanted to come. And when Chrissy found out it was going to be on Sidney Clare Ramirez\u2019s talk show, she wanted to go too.</p><p>\u201cWant to come, Ben? Sounds like the whole family is going to be there!\u201d I wondered if I would ever start calling him \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday. I don\u2019t have to work.\u201d</p> <p>I called Aimee and Matt and told them to come to the show taping\u2014we\u2019d squeeze dinner in afterward. Then I called Greg to make sure he held enough tickets for all of us.</p><p>\u201cSome of you may have to sit in the green room,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFine, just as long as we can be there.\u201d I wasn\u2019t missing Black Diamond receiving their platinum album awards for anything. We\u2019d barely even had time to celebrate, but I mentioned it to Chelsea last night and she had given me a grin and a thumbs up so I knew she was on it.</p><p>Ben went home to get changed and we all started getting ready. There were four of us to get through the shower and Dale alone could take an hour. He liked to just stand there under the water.</p><p>John knocked on our bedroom door while Dale was in the shower, asking if he could bring a date.</p><p>\u201cDebra?\u201d I asked, raising my eyebrows. \u201cGetting serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He actually blushed. He\u2019s stopped bringing her home when Chrissy was being such a brat. John called it her \u201ctesting\u201d phase. I called it her \u201cpsycho bitch\u201d phase but not out loud.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up with her.\u201d I nodded my head in the direction of Chrissy\u2019s room.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, she\u2019s gotten a lot better,\u201d John said. \u201cHer attitude\u2019s improved since you two have been gone. I think she felt jealous\u2014she hasn\u2019t wanted to spend a lot of time with me since the divorce. I think she blamed me.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, not saying anything. Chrissy knew the real reason for the divorce\u2014her mother was dead set on getting Tyler Vincent to leave his wife for her. And after having met her, I could tell she was a woman who got what she wanted\u2014and if she didn\u2019t, well... I was sure her daughter came by her \u201cpsycho bitch\u201d side honestly.</p><p>Of course, I couldn\u2019t say that. John knew nothing about Tyler\u2014still thought Tyler was his friend. And of course, Tyler continued to play into that delusion. It was so sick and twisted it made everything in my family\u2014alcoholism, domestic violence, suicide\u2014pale in comparison.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had some long talks,\u201d John went on. \u201cAnd she\u2019s started school and is doing well. I\u2019m... hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really is like a whole different person,\u201d I said. It was true\u2014although I was still wary. \u201cMaybe she was just possessed by a demon before? Because I\u2019ve seen crazy, but that was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissy\u2019s always been a little dramatic,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cRight. And you\u2019re the master of understatement.\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh.</p><p>By three o\u2019clock we all looked fabulous\u2014except John, who was still in his room.</p><p>\u201cThe van\u2019s waiting,\u201d I called, knocking. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>I gasped when he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d I even took a step back. \u201cYour beard! Your hair!\u201d</p><p>He always wore a bushy beard and his hair had been longer and thicker than mine. Well, it had been. Now it was gone. It wasn\u2019t quite as short as Dale\u2019s, but almost! He had always looked to me like the long-haired hippie English professor and that\u2019s pretty much what he was. The haircut and clean-shaven face gave him a totally different look.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Debra going to say?\u201d I wondered out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt was her idea.\u201d He grinned and blushed at the same time. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes you look younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a plus!\u201d</p><p>We got to see Debra\u2019s when the van drove around to pick her up. Her eyes lit up and a slow smile spread across her face. And all of a sudden I felt like we needed to leave the two of them alone because she looked like she might eat him alive, which was rather awkward. She sat next to him and they held hands, talking quietly together for the rest of the ride.</p><p>And for some reason, I couldn\u2019t stop smiling, the whole way there.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Sidney Clare\u2019s studio was downtown New York. We met Ben at the door, along with Aimee and Matt. Greg wasn\u2019t there but he left tickets for all of us. Someone came to direct special guests to their seats and a pretty brunette took Dale\u2019s sleeve and said, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me, he\u2019s not,\u201d I countered, taking Dale\u2019s other hand.</p><p>I\u2019d been in green rooms before. Lots of snacks. Lots of waiting. I glanced at the clock. It was almost four and the rest of the guys in the band hadn\u2019t arrived. I was getting worried.</p><p>\u201cGreg did call them right?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did.\u201d Dale looked nervous\u2014as nervous as I felt.</p><p>The intro music for Sidney Clare\u2019s show was starting. She a small woman who wore big, thick framed purple glasses\u2014her trademark\u2014and everyone said her name as if it was one word, SidneyClare. She was one of the more controversial talk-show hosts, pushing the boundaries of topic to the edge, although other talk show hosts were jumping on that bandwagon too. But her show wasn\u2019t taped. It was live and whatever happened\u2014happened. The audience loved it, both at the show and at home. People got angry, threw chairs, punched each other. Sometimes when I flipped by, there was a free-for-all brawl. She actually kept security guards standing sentry on either side of the stage for every show.</p><p>And she liked to surprise people for even greater impact. I remembered one story she did about a gay teenager who had a crush. She brought the crush on television under false pretenses and then sprang the gay crush on him. The crush didn\u2019t appreciate it too much, and after the show, he had murdered the gay teen and then killed himself.</p><p>I glanced up at the screen and saw the show was starting. I felt Dale tense beside me.</p><p>\u201cTurn it up!\u201d he urged, feeling around on the couch for the remote. It was next to me on a table and I grabbed it, pushing \u201cvolume\u201d until we could hear the end of Sidney Clare\u2019s introduction.</p><p>\u201cAnd here to talk about that is the man himself, Tyler Vincent!\u201d</p><p>The crowd burst into applause.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d I asked. \u201cIs he giving you the award?\u201d</p><p>It made some logical sense\u2014Tyler had been the announcer at MTV\u2019s Battle of the Bands, although he hadn\u2019t been a judge. All the rumors already flying about nepotism were patently false. Tyler Vincent didn\u2019t have a direct say in whether Black Diamond won\u2014there was a whole panel of judges who had decided that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Dale frowned at the screen. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like it either.</p><p>Dale stood, arms crossed over his chest, as Sidney Clare asked Tyler questions about his music career, his movie career, his family, his wife. She\u2019s lulling him into a false sense of security, I thought. I imagined her like a viper, ready to strike.</p><p>\u201cSo I know you\u2019ve heard the reports, the rumors going around about Dale Diamond, lead singer of Black Diamond, being your son.\u201d</p><p>I froze. No. No no no no. John was in the audience. With Chrissy. And Debra.</p><p>\u201cHe does look a lot like you,\u201d Sidney Clare noted.</p><p>They showed two pictures, side by side, of Tyler and Dale. They\u2019d chosen two pictures that were alike. Both of them were holding guitars. Both of them were smiling at the audience. Thick, dark hair, that dimpled chin. The audience actually gasped when they saw both of them like that, next to each other. I remembered Dale coming into my chemistry class the very first day. Rumors were already flying about how he looked and acted a lot like Tyler Vincent.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d Dale pointed a finger at me. \u201cDo not move from that spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I asked as he headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not doing this. I\u2019m not going to let him do this.\u201d Dale strode out of the room, slamming the door behind him. I stared after him, thinking I should follow. If he walked out on that stage... and then I realized, that was exactly what she wanted to happen. This was a setup!</p><p>\u201cWell, looks can be deceiving, Sidney.\u201d Tyler went on. \u201cI can tell you with a very high degree of certainty that Dale is not my son. He\u2019s a great kid and an amazing musician. And I do know him and his family, they\u2019re wonderful people. But he isn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe papers are saying you had an affair with his mother,\u201d Sidney Clare prompted, crossing her legs and leaning forward on the arm of her chair. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Tyler hesitated, glanced out toward the audience and then back at Sidney Clare. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>A collective gasp went up from the audience.</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen?\u201d Sidney Clare prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago. I was teaching at a university in Maine and I met a man on the faculty named John Diamond. We became friends.\u201d</p><p>The television flashed to John, in the audience, and my stomach sank. They knew. They knew everything. This whole show was being orchestrated. So why was Tyler lying? Then I remembered John telling Chrissy\u2014he\u2019d talked to Tyler, he said. They were going to fix it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look away from the screen.</p><p>\u201cJohn and I started hanging out, doing things together\u2014boating, fishing. Our wives got along. It was great for a while. Then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Sidney Clare prompted.</p><p>\u201cThen John\u2019s wife, Stacy... started coming on to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? What did she do?\u201d</p><p>The camera panned to the audience and they all looked like me\u2014on the edge of their seats.</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t she do?\u201d Tyler gave a short, bitter laugh. \u201cAt first it was just verbal. Telling me how much she admired me. Talking about how unhappy she was in her marriage. Then she started finding me alone, brushing up against me. Trying to kiss me. I was shocked at first. Then... flattered, I guess. And my wife and I\u2014we were going through a rough time right about then. I guess it just all fell into place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you had an affair?\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded. \u201cYes, I did. It was brief\u2014a few months at most. I broke it off. And that\u2019s when things got... crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy, what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the movie that came out a few years ago, with Glenn Close and Michael Douglas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFatal Attraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d Tyler nodded, looking out at the audience. The man was a great actor. The look of helpless guilt and regret on his face was textbook. The whole audience was quiet, listening, and even sitting in the green room watching it unfold on the screen, I could feel the tide of public opinion turning. They\u2019re going to blame it on Dale\u2019s mother, I thought. And she wasn\u2019t even there to defend herself. I was starting to feel nauseous.</p><p>\u201cSidney, she was insane.\u201d Tyler looked like he was on the verge of tears. \u201cI did a horrible thing. I know that. And I apologized to my wife and have spent every day since trying to make it up to her. But Stacy Diamond\u2014I guess she\u2019s Stacy Spencer now, she took her maiden name after the divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce? Did her husband find out?\u201d Sidney Clare asked the question the whole audience wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI told him myself.\u201d</p> <p>What?</p><p>The camera panned to John, who looked sad, but otherwise gave no reaction.</p><p>\u201cI had to,\u201d Tyler went on. \u201cHis wife was crazy. I mean, she made Glenn Close look sane. She threatened my wife, my family. She was obsessed with me. So I went to John and told him what was going on. And he got her the help she needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was the end of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d Tyler sighed. \u201cJohn and I... he\u2019s just a great guy. He forgave me, if you can believe that. We continued to remain friends. But things were never quite the same. He knew his wife was mentally ill but he did everything he could throughout his marriage to keep it from his children and I don\u2019t blame him. She was in therapy for a while and then they put her on medication. For a long time it worked.\u201d</p><p>Tyler paused and they panned to the audience again, all leaning forward, listening.</p> <p>\u201cThen she stopped taking her medication. And the obsession came back,\u201d Tyler said. He had a flair for the dramatic, that was for sure. \u201cShe was relentless. She wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. She pursued me endlessly. I didn\u2019t know what to do. For years, things had been fine. Now our kids were older, they were friends. It was a delicate situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have sex with her again, Tyler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce.\u201d He lowered his head. \u201cMy wife was out at the store. All our kids were playing in the pool. John wasn\u2019t there that day. I believe he had to work. She came into my room while I was changing into my suit...\u201d</p><p>I gaped at the screen. It was the story Dale had told me\u2014how he\u2019d found out his mother was having an affair. He\u2019d walked in on them that day.</p><p>This was all planned, I realized. Perfectly orchestrated. John had told Chrissy he was going to \u201ccall Tyler and fix it,\u201d and here it was happening, live on national television. Dale wasn\u2019t going to be seen as a young kid trying to ride his father\u2019s coat tails into fame and fortune. After this, he would be seen as a victim. Tyler was taking the fall, but it would be Dale\u2019s mother everyone would blame.</p><p>Just like Fatal Attraction. I shivered. Once Glenn Close started boiling bunnies, everyone had sympathy for poor Michael Douglas, who had done nothing except give into his basic, animal instincts after all. Poor man.</p><p>\u201cShe cornered me. I didn\u2019t want to. But I was afraid of what she might do or say. So I... we did. We had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that one time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cUnfortunately, Dale came into the room... during...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe discovered you and his mother having sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tyler cleared his throat. \u201cI tried to talk to him later but he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame him,\u201d Sidney Clare snapped.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t take the bait. He hung his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>The camera focused on Sidney Clare\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhen we come back, find out what Tyler Vincent did to try and protect his family from an obsessed fan.\u201d</p><p>Protect his family? They made him sound like a boy scout. And obsessed fan? She was a woman he was involved with for years! They\u2019d been lovers before Dale was born. Tyler even admitted as much.</p><p>The screen showed commercials, just like the viewers at home saw. But I knew, down the hall, all of this was happening live. And Dale was walking right into the trap. I sprang from the sofa and rushed out the door. The hallways were numerous but there was a red arrow with \u201cstudio\u201d painted on each wall, showing the direction.</p><p>I followed the arrows, coming out to a backstage area where crew was hurrying around, getting things done. I was familiar enough with a crew to know they probably wouldn\u2019t even pay attention to me\u2014until I walked out on the stage.</p><p>But Dale beat me to it.</p><p>He was on the other side, in the wings, just like me, but I didn\u2019t see him until he stalked out onto the stage. Tyler didn\u2019t see him coming. Dale could have stabbed him in the back and he wouldn\u2019t have known it until the knife was between his shoulder blades. But Sidney Clare saw him coming. Her eyes widened as Dale approached.</p><p>\u201cUh... Tyler...\u201d She had a mic on so everyone heard it. The audience gasped as Dale faced his father. Tyler stood the minute Dale came around that side of the sofa. They stood there talking, but Tyler had muffled his mic. I couldn\u2019t hear anything. And neither could the audience.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re live in twenty seconds.\u201d The announcement over the PA startled me.</p><p>\u201cSit down!\u201d Sidney Clare stood, trying to get Tyler to take his seat again, but he and Dale were still in a heated argument. \u201cThis is a live show! Sit down now!\u201d</p><p>She was half their size but she got her way. Tyler finally relented. Dale stood for a moment, glanced at the camera, and then took a seat on the couch with Tyler\u2014as far away as he could get.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back.\u201d Sidney Clare smiled, looking as poised as ever. \u201cToday I have with me...\u201d</p><p>Sidney recapped things for viewers just tuning in, also introducing Dale, who was brooding on the other end of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cSo Dale. \u201cSidney leaned in, just like she had with Tyler, using that same, kind, soft voice that meant, tell me everything, I\u2019m your friend. \u201cHow do you feel about everything you\u2019ve heard so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d he snapped. \u201cThis man is a liar and a coward. I don\u2019t like him, I never have, and I\u2019ve spent most of my life trying not to be like him. I\u2019m ashamed that he\u2019s my father. I wish he wasn\u2019t. But wishing doesn\u2019t make things true.\u201d</p><p>I knew, somewhere, Greg Richer was having a heart attack. He\u2019d set this whole thing up, I was sure of it, to clear Dale\u2019s name and dissociate him from Tyler as much as possible. This was television\u2014they could make everyone believe a lie. It was easy.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know, Dale?\u201d Sidney Clare asked gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dale glared at her. \u201cHow do I know he\u2019s my father? My mother told me so. She told me everything. The affair started before me and my sister were even born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister?\u201d Sidney Clare prompted. I glanced at the screen overhead and sure enough, the camera was on Chrissy. They planned it all.</p><p>And now Dale was ruining all their plans, simply because he couldn\u2019t stand by and watch Tyler sitting up there and telling more lies, denying everything Dale knew to be true. If Dale had just kept his mouth shut and gone along with it, the world would have believed Tyler Vincent. He was a consummate actor, a master manipulator.</p><p>I could hear Greg in my head. What are you doing, Dale? What the hell are you doing?</p><p>But there was no way to stop him. Dale was going to tell the truth and force Tyler to tell it too. Finally, a lifetime of secrets would be over. I knew he was putting his career in jeopardy. I knew he was risking the tide of public opinion turning against him, seeing him as a young moocher, trying to take the shortcut to become some sort of rock star. I knew, if the execs at MTV got wind of it and decided to take back Black Diamond\u2019s win at the Battle of the Bands two years ago, it would mar Dale\u2019s career as a musician for the rest of his life. The consequences of telling the truth now were huge.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t have been more proud of him for walking out there and doing it.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me again, how do you know this man\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Dale said simply. \u201cShe told me herself. She even left my father for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale, listen to me.\u201d Sidney Clare leaned forward. \u201cI understand that\u2019s the truth you\u2019ve lived with. But what if what Tyler says is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t.\u201d Dale shook his head, adamant. \u201cMy dad\u2014John Diamond\u2014he\u2019s the best man I know. If I could a pick a father out of all the men I\u2019ve known in my life, it would be John Diamond. I\u2019m proud to have his name. And I\u2019m grateful to have had the opportunity to be raised by him.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyes stinging with tears. The camera showed John, eyes glistening. Next to him, Debra took his hand. Chrissy was on his other side, tears sliding down her face as she leaned her cheek against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBut the truth is, John can\u2019t have kids.\u201d Dale sighed. \u201cMy parents had problems having kids early in their marriage. They had all the usual tests. My dad has a low sperm count.\u201d</p><p>The audience gasped. I blinked in surprise, looking from the Dale on stage to the Dale on screen. He\u2019d never told me that. No wonder he was so sure that Tyler was his real father?</p><p>\u201cMy mother showed me the lab results when I didn\u2019t want to believe her\u2014when she told me Tyler was my father,\u201d Dale said. \u201cShe never told my dad\u2014John. Damn it, he\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s the man I\u2019ve called dad all my life and I\u2019m not going to stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Sidney Clare soothed.</p><p>I wanted to run out there on stage and put my arms around him. He was so brave.</p><p>\u201cSo John, the man who raised you\u2014he didn\u2019t know any of this?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t want him to know about Tyler,\u201d Dale said. \u201cAnd neither did I. When I found out my younger sister knew, I swore her to secrecy. When they divorced, I thought it would finally come out, but it didn\u2019t. No one talked about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were protecting John?\u201d Sidney asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked out into the audience, finding his dad, their eyes locked. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do for people you love.\u201d</p><p>Now I was really crying, tears just streaming down my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, son.\u201d Tyler put a hand on Dale\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what people do when they love someone. No one likes to watch someone they love in pain.\u201d</p><p>Tyler calling Dale \u201cson.\u201d I felt a lump rising in my throat. Was he saying that he was there, trying to protect Dale? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour father loves you.\u201d Tyler pointed out into the audience.</p><p>The camera zoomed in on John. He looked so different without the beard and all his long hair! I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him. I frowned, something clenching in my belly as I looked at his face filling the screen. I had a moment of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or more like a sudden flash of memory or recognition.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your father, Dale.\u201d Tyler he said. \u201cI know you love your mother and you want to protect her too. But everything I\u2019ve said here today is the truth\". And your father knows it.\u201d</p><p>I saw John nodding, his eyes locked on his son, sitting on stage.</p> <p>Dale frowned, looking from John to Tyler and back again.</p><p>\u201cWe need to take a break,\u201d Sidney Clare announced. \u201cStay tuned for more on this fascinating family celebrity drama.\u201d</p><p>Is that what it was? Fascinating celebrity drama?</p><p>As soon as the cameras cut off I ran onto the stage. As I predicted, the crew didn\u2019t even notice me until I did.</p><p>Dale put his arms around me, pulling be down to the sofa beside him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Sidney Clare informed the crew, waving them back. \u201cShe\u2019s his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDale, are you okay?\u201d I ignored her and Tyler and everyone else.</p><p>He gave me a slow nod but I knew better. Inside, it was turmoil. I could see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think...\u201d He hesitated, looking up and seeing John and Chrissy both coming onto the stage, Debra following tentatively behind.</p><p>Dale stood as his father approached and I\u2019ll never forget the look of confusion on his face. And it was that moment I saw it, really saw it. Dale wasn\u2019t Tyler\u2019s. John and Dale had the same blue eyes, the same high cheek bones, the same dimpled chin. John\u2019s features had been so covered in hair, his eyes hidden behind a pair of glasses, I\u2019d never noticed it before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d John put his arms around Dale and brought him in for a huge hug. I cried just seeing them together like that. Chrissy leaned against her father\u2019s side and he included her too, the three of them standing on stage, one little family that had been the victim of more than enough drama in their lives.</p> <p>\u201cI was just trying to protect you,\u201d John said. I saw he was crying too. \u201cYour mother... when she\u2019s not on her medication, she has these mood swings. She\u2019s very volatile. I wanted to protect you from that. From her obsessions and her lies. I had no idea... I didn\u2019t know, until Chrissy told me, that she\u2019d convinced you both you weren\u2019t even my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me Dad didn\u2019t want me,\u201d Chrissy said, her lower lip trembling. \u201cShe told me he only wanted you, because you were a boy. So I stayed... I stayed with her. Dale, she got so bad. Finally, Dad convinced her she needed to get help, go back on her medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really is out of control when she\u2019s not on her medications,\u201d John said sadly. \u201cShe will go to great lengths to convince you to believe in her delusions. But I can assure you both, we never had a problem conceiving. You\u2019re both very much my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsst.\u201d Sidney Clare tried to interrupt their little threesome. \u201cUm, can you save some of this for when we come back live? This is great stuff!\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, disbelieving.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, lady.\u201d Dale shook his head. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Sidney Clare called after us as we started off stage. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear the DNA results? Tyler has a blood test that proves\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need proof,\u201d Dale replied, looking straight at John. \u201cThis is my father. And I believe him.\u201d</p> <p>Backstage, the crew was going crazy, trying to get us all back onto the stage. We all refused, so Sidney Clare continued to talk to Tyler. I saw some of it as John and Dale and Chrissy stood there talking and hugging and telling each other things they\u2019d never shared aloud to one another before.</p><p>Tyler did have DNA evidence. He\u2019d done it, he said, to prove to Dale\u2019s mother once and for all that he wasn\u2019t the father of her children. She accused him of faking the test, switching samples. She simply wouldn\u2019t believe.</p><p>Then Ben came backstage, giving me a giant hug before he said anything at all.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want me as a daughter?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe\u2019re a pretty crazy family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Ben asked, smiling down at me. \u201cI\u2019ve found sometimes the best things in life are crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fit in just find around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAimee!\u201d I cried, waving her and Matt over. They\u2019d found their way backstage. \u201cOh my god, you look gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look fat.\u201d She made a face, rolling her eyes and smoothing her hands over her growing belly. \u201cBut she\u2019s growing just fine, so I can live with it for nine months I guess. Looks like we\u2019ll have a Christmas baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d I raised my eyebrows. \u201cFor sure, a girl?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think Matt wanted a boy but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Matt shook his head. \u201cI just have to make sure I get myself a shotgun to sit on the porch with.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell since the gang\u2019s all here, how about we go to dinner before my son has to go play his music in front of thirty thousand fans?\u201d John suggested, his arm around Dale\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cProud Papa.\u201d I kissed John on his now very smooth cheek.</p><p>\u201cI have to make a phone call first,\u201d Dale said.</p><p>I looked at him, questioning.</p><p>\u201cI have to fire my manager,\u201d he said, glancing up at Tyler still talking to Sidney Clare. \u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being ambushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue. He\u2019s never liked me. But I think he was just trying to protect you,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dale shook his head. \u201cMy father was trying to protect me. My manager was trying to protect his investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame him?\u201d I smiled, putting my arms around his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done keeping secrets.\u201d Dale touched his forehead to mine. \u201cI\u2019m done with lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pick the date. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s on camera in front of a zillion people or at the highest mountain at the edge of the world. You name the time and the place and I\u2019ll be there. I\u2019m going to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d I could see the shine of my ring under the lights.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d His words flooded me with warmth.</p><p>\u201cYou know what that will make me?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cMrs. Sara Diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe luckiest girl in the world.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>\u201cSara?\u201d Aimee snapped her fingers in front of my face. \u201cEarth to Sara!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I startled. \u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here,\u201d she insisted, coming up behind me and adjusting the veil that had been adjusted a hundred times today.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I looked at myself in the free-standing full-length mirror that had been set up. Dale hadn\u2019t seen the dress\u2014I had to hold onto some traditions. But we were definitely not throwing bouquets or garters.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d Wendy burst into the room, followed by Carrie. \u201cThey flew him in on a helicopter!\u201d</p><p>I smiled, looking at all three of them. \u201cRemember when we did this at your wedding, Aimee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the perfect wedding.\u201d She sighed. \u201cUntil a bunch of screaming teenagers crashed in to see your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still sorry about that.\u201d I winced.</p><p>\u201cIt will make a great story to tell the grandkids,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think Dharma has a little while to wait before she\u2019s ready to give you grandkids,\u201d I said with a laugh. As if on cue, Mrs. Wells came in, bouncing a baby on her hip.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hungry, little Mama and I don\u2019t have the equipment.\u201d</p><p>Aimee laughed. \u201cHand her over. I have a minute to nurse her.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been so touched when Aimee said they wanted to name her Dharma. It meant some little part of her lived on. I didn\u2019t believe in fate or superstition, but Aimee\u2019s Dharma reminded me of my own in ways I couldn\u2019t even explain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loving this one wedding a year thing,\u201d Wendy said, smoothing down the deep velvet purple of her dress. \u201cI get these dresses hemmed and they\u2019re perfect for a night on the town!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because we have so many of those,\u201d Carrie said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWe would, if you weren\u2019t such a homebody.\u201d Wendy poked her.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about the girls who crashed my wedding, Mom,\u201d Aimee said, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cOh what a disaster that was.\u201d Mrs. Wells shook her head. \u201cWell that won\u2019t happen here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Carrie shook her head. \u201cNot even possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d Debra stuck her head in, smiling at me. \u201cYou are just the most beautiful bride I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI hope he thinks so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already does.\u201d Aimee said, standing up. Dharma had clearly decided she just wanted a little snack. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, picking up my bouquet of freesia and lavender and daisies, and stepped outside of the tent. The wind up here was strong and I reached for my veil.</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d Debra secured a few more pins. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to have a wedding at the top of a mountain in Greece, you have to be ready with extra bobby pins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I leaned over and kissed her cheek. She was the closest thing I had to a mother and I couldn\u2019t have asked for better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here!\u201d Chrissy ran out of one of the tents set up for guests wearing her bridesmaids dress and matching heels. \u201cAm I late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just made it.\u201d Deb laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay girls, let\u2019s line up,\u201d Mrs. Wells directed. \u201cSara, you start over there.\u201d</p><p>I turned and saw John, clean-shaven, his hair still short\u2014he\u2019d decided he liked it\u2014standing next to Ben. They both looked incredibly handsome in their tuxes and they both smiled back at me as I approached.</p><p>Dale Diamond was waiting for me at the top of the world, in a gazebo we had actually paid someone to build. They had to bring up the pieces, they told me, by donkey. I didn\u2019t ask how that worked, exactly, but the gazebo was there and Dale was in it.</p><p>Today was our day. Dale was waiting for me. And I had two men who loved me, two men I proudly called, \u201cDad,\u201d to walk me down the aisle.</p><p>I really was the luckiest girl in the world. </p> </body></html>"]
