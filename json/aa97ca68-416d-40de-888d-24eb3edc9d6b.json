I know from experience that if I\u2019m sleeping, it\u2019ll still be there when I wake up. A pungent reminder of a night I\u2019ll never get away from.</p><p>It\u2019s a hell that I\u2019ll never escape.</p><p>Even as I squirm, as I try to wake, a noise penetrates my consciousness, a noise that doesn\u2019t belong in this dream. I know that because I\u2019ve relived the same nightmare a hundred times. This new sound and sensation don\u2019t belong.</p><p>It\u2019s the unmistakable crunch of bone in my hand.</p> <p>My eyes snap open and I look around, registering several things at once.</p><p>I am in a whorehouse in Kabul, the same one I always use. The girl\u2019s black hair is grasped tightly in my fingers, wrapped around my left hand. With my right, I clutch her limp hand, her broken fingers splayed at unnatural angles.</p><p>I immediately release her fingers and she stares at me, pressing her other hand to her mouth to contain a scream. Tears flood her eyes and spill down her crushed cheek. The blood turns her tears red and I realize something. The smell of blood wasn\u2019t coming from my dream. It was coming from her.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>There is blood everywhere, spewing from her nose and her eye, from the entire side of her shattered face, dripping onto her naked olive skin and staining the yellowed sheets of the bed. I gasp and instinctively back away from her in horror, my gut tightening in shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I manage to choke.</p> <p>When I move, she cradles her broken hand.</p><p>The hand that I broke.</p><p>Sweat forms immediately on my brow and my heart pounds wildly. I did this to her. I did this to her. What the fuck have I done? I\u2019m panicked and shaken, but at the same time, my training kicks in and I pull myself together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell her quickly, gathering my wits and stepping toward her, reaching out to assess her injuries. She flinches away, fear apparent in her wild eyes as she turns her shoulders away from me, as if to absorb another blow. My gut sinks at her response, at the knowledge that she is terrified of me.</p><p>At the sick realization that she has a reason to be.</p><p>I swallow hard, the thick taste of self-revulsion pooling in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I tell her raggedly, holding my hand out. \u201cLet me see. I won\u2019t hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>The prostitute, a slender girl named Niki, trembles but forces herself to remain still as I feel her arms and legs. She sucks in a breath when I get too close to her broken hand, but rigidly allows me to examine everything else. It\u2019s almost odd. I\u2019ve fucked this girl twenty different ways to Sunday, but right now she\u2019s as distant as a stranger. Because she\u2019s terrified.</p> <p>Of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I tell her, glancing away from her stiff blood-spattered shoulders. \u201cI won\u2019t come here anymore. I was asleep. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I won\u2019t ever hurt you again, Niki. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>One of her eyes is swollen shut, but the other one widens at my words and she grabs me with her good hand. Her fingers are cold and they shake.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispers. \u201cIf you stay away, they will beat me for being unpleasing to you. Please. Do not stay away, soldier.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, aghast. \u201cI just beat you,\u201d I tell her slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, but that\u2019s not an excuse. I just beat you.\u201d</p><p>Niki shakes her head, flinching as the movement causes her pain. Guilt floods through me. I hurt an innocent woman. Jesus Christ. I\u2019m a monster.</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping,\u201d Niki says adamantly. \u201cYou have nightmares when you sleep. It wasn\u2019t you. It was the bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bad thing?\u201d I ask uncertainly, my eyes frozen on her bloody face. She nods.</p><p>\u201cIt chases you,\u201d she answers solemnly in her thick Afghan accent. \u201cIt is different for everyone, but it chases us all. The bad thing caught you.\u201d</p><p>The bad thing caught me.</p><p>I swallow hard, trying to dislodge the fucking lump that has formed in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Niki,\u201d I tell her again. \u201cMaybe the bad thing did catch me. I swear I\u2019ll make it right.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me curiously, her body tense with pain, but stays motionless as I wrap a sheet around her shoulders and quickly get dressed.</p><p>I\u2019m out the door and down the hall within a minute. I ignore the moans and shrieks and thumping noises coming from the other dark, tiny rooms as I make my way down the battered hallway to the office. I know the man in charge sits in there, because I pay him every time I visit Niki.</p><p>He looks up at me in surprise when I walk in, but I don\u2019t hesitate. I toss all the money that I have in my wallet onto his desk; all the strange-looking foreign money that is equivalent to hundreds and hundreds of US dollars.</p><p>\u201cThe girl has pleased me,\u201d I tell him quietly. \u201cI will be returning to the United States, but I\u2019ll miss her. She should be rewarded. Also, she needs a doctor. She\u2019s hurt.\u201d</p><p>The man stares up at me, his dark gaze gleaming at the sight of the large pile of money. He nods curtly without speaking, clearly unworried about the bloody girl down the hall as he snakes out dark fingers to scrape the bills toward him.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a doctor,\u201d I tell him firmly, gritting the words from between my teeth. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I slam my fist down on his table, hard, right in the middle of the money.</p><p>He looks up at me and wordlessly picks up the phone. He mutters words into it that I can\u2019t understand, then hangs up.</p><p>\u201cIt is done,\u201d he says shortly, returning his attention to the papers on his desk.</p><p>Without another word I slip out into the darkened streets of Kabul, making my way back to my camp outside of town. After I\u2019m back in my tent, I mechanically begin folding things neatly into my knapsack. When my fingers brush against my satellite phone, I pick it up, then punch numbers into it.</p><p>\u201cColonel?\u201d I say when he answers. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need to send another XO out here. I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>The colonel doesn\u2019t ask why. He knows me well enough to trust my judgment calls. If I say I\u2019m coming in from the field, he trusts that there\u2019s a good reason. And of course there is. This is the only life I\u2019ve ever wanted. Only something monumental would force me to walk away from it.</p><p>The bad thing caught you.</p><p>I\u2019ve never retreated in my life. I\u2019ve never backed away from a fight and I\u2019ve never cowered in fear. Ever. That\u2019s not who I am. But I\u2019ve been in combat long enough to know that when something unbeatable chases you, you do the only thing you can do.</p><p>You run.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Eight Months Later</p><p>Chicago</p><p>Madison</p><p>The music in this club is so loud that it literally thumps in my chest, rattling into my rib cage. What the hell do people see in places like this? I cough from the fog-maker\u2019s smoke, then strain my neck as I try to find my friend Jacey among the hundreds of sweaty people crammed in this room.</p><p>The last I saw, she\u2019d disappeared into a dark corner with her loser boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my friend? The blonde in the tight red shirt?\u201d I yell to the random guy who has been intently watching me like a creeper for ten minutes. He smiles a piranha grin and inches toward me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he yells back. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need her for what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>Gross.</p><p>\u201cNot now, not ever,\u201d I answer coldly, turning my back on him to search the crush of people on the dance floor. I seriously just want to go home.</p><p>How I let Jacey talk me into coming into the city to celebrate her birthday is far, far beyond me right now. I\u2019m supposed to finally meet her brother tonight, but Jacey disappeared with her boyfriend over an hour ago and I haven\u2019t seen them since. My feet hurt, I\u2019m exhausted from working sixty hours this week and I need something to eat before I stab someone\u2019s eye out.</p><p>Knowing my limitations, I make my way through the bar and onto the sidewalk out front. I\u2019ve got to get out of here. I\u2019m the one who drove us, but I\u2019m sure Jacey can get a ride home with Peter if she needs to. Her boyfriend can\u2019t hold down a job, but at least he can drive.</p><p>I pull my phone out. I\u2019m leaving. Can you catch a ride home with Peter?</p><p>As soon as I send the text, I realize that she\u2019s not going to be able to hear it. So who knows when she\u2019ll see it? With a sigh, I decide I have to hunt for her. At least for a few minutes. It wouldn\u2019t be right to just leave her here.</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to have public sex with my boyfriend, where would I be?\u201d I muse aloud, trying to think like Jacey as I walk around to the side of the club. Jacey is pathetically bad about PDA. She doesn\u2019t give a flying eff what people think about her. It\u2019s one thing that I both admire about her and get annoyed at.</p><p>As I get farther and farther away from the sidewalk and into the shadows, it seems more and more like someplace Jacey and Peter might be getting it on against the building. But at the same time, it also seems like the perfect place to get mugged. It makes me instantly nervous and I glance around quickly.</p><p>I\u2019m in an alley now, a narrow wet street that is littered with trash and graffiti. My heels click on the glistening asphalt and I take a deep breath, enjoying the fresh air as the inky darkness swallows me.</p><p>Thank God I\u2019m out of that club. That\u2019s my main thought as I walk farther into the darkness, but even still, I reach into my purse and grip my little can of pepper-spray. It doesn\u2019t hurt to be prepared.</p><p>There\u2019s nobody here. That much is apparent as I take in the dirty building, the heaping trash bins and the empty shadows. Well, I\u2019m hoping the shadows are empty, anyway. They seem to be. And I seem to be all alone. While that\u2019s comforting on the one hand, it\u2019s frustrating on the other.</p><p>\u201cJacey, where the fuck are you?\u201d I mutter.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m getting ready to give up and head back into the club, I catch sight of something that snags my attention and I stop.</p><p>A guy is leaning against the building a little ways from me, half in the darkness, half in the light. Normally that wouldn\u2019t give me pause, especially since I\u2019m in an alley alone. But something about his posture intrigues me, something that I can\u2019t quite put my finger on.</p><p>I peer at him more closely.</p><p>His long legs are crossed gracefully in front of him as he leans against the building. And holy cow, he\u2019s big. He\u2019s got to be a few inches over six feet tall with a broad chest and wide shoulders that narrow into a slender waist.</p><p>It\u2019s chilly outside, but he\u2019s not wearing a jacket, only a snug black T-shirt and a pair of perfectly fitting jeans. There isn\u2019t a trace of fat on him. He\u2019s lean and muscled, with short darkish hair. From the side his features are chiseled and from what I can tell, he\u2019s got just the barest hint of stubble along his strong jaw. That\u2019s an instant turn-on for me. It seems so rugged.</p><p>And this guy... he definitely seems rugged. Everything about him screams strength and power. That\u2019s an instant turn-on for me too. I decide that this is what intrigues me. He\u2019s like power personified. He holds himself with purpose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I watch, he lights up a cigarette and takes a drag, releasing the smoke slowly into the night. His lips are full and masculine and he\u2019s got a cleft in his chin. He\u2019s undeniably sexy. Normally I would stay far away from someone like him, someone sinfully sexy but so... forceful. A guy like that is trouble. That\u2019s for sure.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t come to the club tonight to run away.</p><p>I came here to hook up. To blow off my responsibilities and be reckless for a night. To act my age. To be someone I\u2019m not.</p><p>I eye the guy again.</p> <p>Normally I would run away from him.</p><p>But maybe... just tonight... I won\u2019t.</p><p>I don\u2019t have to be me tonight. I can be anyone I want to be because he\u2019ll never see me again.</p><p>Just for tonight.</p><p>I hesitate, trying to decide what to do.</p> <p>Then, almost as though my feet have a mind of their own, I take a step toward him. And then another.</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>My cigarette burns red in the dark as I take a nice long drag. I suck in the city air and the nicotine, then exhale the toxic waste. I know that smokes are bad for me, that they\u2019re shit for my lungs, but I don\u2019t particularly care right now.</p><p>From inside the club, I can feel the bass thumping against the wall, vibrating my spine. Inside, women are mindlessly mashing together on the dance floor in time to those drums, waiting for guys like me to take them home and fuck them.</p><p>I don\u2019t care about that either. I had to get some fresh air, to get away from the claustrophobic club smoke and sweat before I fucking exploded.</p><p>If I were a normal person, I\u2019d be nervous in a dark Chicago alley by myself. I\u2019m not a normal person, though, and the shit I saw in Afghanistan rendered my ability to feel fear impotent.</p> <p>But not the rest of me.</p><p>I shift my weight and adjust the boys and my semi-hard dick. I\u2019d have to be inhuman to not be horny after watching the half-dressed drunk girls rub themselves on anyone who might buy them a drink. I should feel bad about that, but I don\u2019t.</p><p>Before my tour overseas, I wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead with any of them. But after being overseas for three years, my penis isn\u2019t listening to reason anymore. It knows what I need.</p><p>I sigh and adjust the constraining crotch of my jeans again, before taking another deep breath, then another. My dick starts to calm down and my claustrophobic feelings begin to fade. Thank God. One of the many things I brought home was claustrophobia, and it\u2019s not even the predictable kind where I\u2019m afraid of small spaces. It\u2019s the random kind that can strike at the strangest times, like in the middle of a crowd.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>I toss down the cigarette and grind it out with my heel, then pull out another, lighting it up. It\u2019s a bad habit I brought back with me, along with a couple tattoos and the tendency to wake up in a cold sweat from crazy-ass nightmares.</p><p>\u201cYou know those will kill you, right?\u201d</p><p>I startle to attention, my head snapping around to find the soft voice in the dark.</p> <p>A woman steps closer and I can\u2019t believe that I didn\u2019t see her approach.</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>We\u2019re the only two people in an isolated alley. How could I have missed her? My senses have seriously dulled since I\u2019ve been back stateside. She\u2019s a tall, willowy bombshell, the kind of woman who stands out in a crowd, let alone an abandoned street.</p><p>Blonde hair falls halfway down her back and wide eyes stare at me. Her full lips are pursed, as though she\u2019s trying to decide if it\u2019s safe to be out here. And it\u2019s not, especially for a woman who looks like she does.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know walking alone in a dark Chicago alley is more dangerous than a cigarette?\u201d</p><p>I gaze at her levelly as I take another drag on my smoke.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look afraid at all as she shrugs.</p><p>\u201cEither of those things has to be better than being crushed to death in there.\u201d</p><p>She gestures toward the closed club door in disdain. I examine her again. She\u2019s wearing the right clothes to be here... tight pink leather pants, a cream-colored halter top, equally tight, and a pair of extremely high glittery heels. As I examine her, I notice that she\u2019s not wearing a bra under her light-colored shirt. Somehow that looks out of place on her, as though she doesn\u2019t fit the slutty clothes.</p><p>The problem is, the slutty clothes definitely fit her, in all the right places. My dick lurches back to life as my gaze skims over her curved hips and tight ass.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, want one?\u201d I offer her the pack.</p><p>She looks surprised, then chuckles, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m already in the alley alone. I think that\u2019s enough of a risk tonight.\u201d</p><p>I grin back as I tuck the smokes into my pocket. \u201cBut you\u2019re not alone now. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me and I can see now that her eyes are blue.</p><p>\u201cSomehow,\u201d she says thoughtfully, \u201cI doubt I\u2019m any safer.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cSomehow, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>The funny thing is, she doesn\u2019t look worried. In fact, she steps closer and leans against the filthy brick wall beside me. Even under the yellowed dingy streetlight, she looks flawless.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get dirty,\u201d I point out. She looks up at me innocently, her blue eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI like getting dirty sometimes.\u201d</p><p>And then she grins a wicked grin.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve been sucker-punched as all the air whooshes out of my body. A suggestive grin like that on this runway model is too much for my logical thought processes to overcome. My good sense has apparently been hijacked by my hormones.</p><p>Tossing the smoke down on the sidewalk, I grind the heel of my boot into it. I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing, but I don\u2019t much care at this point. I\u2019m horny and she\u2019s gorgeous. That\u2019s a perfect arrangement if I ever saw one. The air between us practically crackles with sexual attraction.</p><p>I look down at her and as I do, I let myself lean into her. She\u2019s soft and she smells even softer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Madison,\u201d she answers. She hasn\u2019t looked away from me even once. She\u2019s definitely into me, although God knows why. I\u2019m as different from her as I can be.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Madison?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou seem a little out of place.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly looks self-conscious. \u201cA friend talked me into coming. She thought I needed a night in the big city. But I really wish I was home instead. I\u2019m tired and these heels hurt.\u201d</p><p>I smile. Her shoes do look painful as hell. I\u2019ve never understood why women wear shit like that.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t live here?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and as she does, her scent seems to envelop us, blocking out the pungent city smells. Her nearness is intoxicating and I brace myself against it so I don\u2019t get sucked in any further.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m from a little lake town, just an hour or so from here. But it seems like a world away. I\u2019m not much of a big-city girl. Not anymore, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I actually wouldn\u2019t have guessed that. She\u2019s got that perfectly put-together look that big-city girls have, that perfectly confident attitude.</p><p>She nudges me, her slender shoulder bumping mine. \u201cWhy are you here? You don\u2019t look like you fit here either. Not here at this club, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I cock an eyebrow. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>The Underground is a trendy Chicago hot spot. And she\u2019s right. I don\u2019t fit in here. I fit in a Humvee in the hills of Afghanistan. Except I don\u2019t. Not anymore.</p><p>Madison notices my expression and flushes.</p><p>\u201cNo offense. But you\u2019re not wearing skinny jeans and hipster glasses. You seem more like... the football-playing type. Or the outdoors type, maybe.\u201d</p><p>I smile down at her. \u201cNo offense taken. And I am more of the outdoors type.\u201d</p><p>The gun-toting soldier type, to be exact, but I don\u2019t say that.</p><p>Madison looks relieved. \u201cI thought so. So what are you doing in the middle of the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I don\u2019t live here? Can\u2019t I enjoy the outdoors but still live in the city? Or am I too uncool for that?\u201d I raise my eyebrow again.</p><p>She flushes yet again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I just assumed. Where do you live?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cHere. Just call me a fish out of water.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and swats at me, but I easily catch her wrist and pull her to me instead. It\u2019s a ballsy move, but I\u2019m feeling cocky. She doesn\u2019t resist, which both pleases and surprises me.</p><p>She presses against me, looking into my eyes. She looks expectant and nervous, confident yet hesitant. Her tits are smashed against me, making it hard to form coherent thoughts, hard to examine our differences or even her motives. Her softness is the perfect contrast to my hardness. That\u2019s all I can think about.</p><p>\u201cTo answer your question, I\u2019m here at the club because my little sister thought I should come out and meet someone. To quote her, I\u2019m \u2018getting mean as hell and need a piece of ass.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Madison laughs, a low and husky sound.</p><p>\u201cDo you? Need a piece of ass?\u201d</p><p>She sounds anxious. And interested.</p><p>I hold her gaze.</p><p>\u201cMore than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>I slide my hands from her back down to her ass, cupping it, squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cAnd I like yours,\u201d I add. I\u2019m being cocky again, but she seems to like it.</p><p>She practically purrs as she leans into me even closer, her nose almost touching mine. Her lips hover so close that I can feel them.</p><p>She slides her hands down to my ass, gripping it in her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYours will do.\u201d</p><p>The air hangs heavy between us, charged and electric. Our eyes are locked and we each pause, waiting for the other to make a move.</p><p>The anticipation is killing me.</p><p>I take a breath.</p><p>Then she takes one.</p><p>Her lips graze mine and her mouth smells like mint. And then before I can think another agonizing thought, she covers my mouth with her own.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Her tongue slips into my mouth and she tastes like Heaven, like an icy drink of water at the end of a hot day in the desert. Our tongues tangle together and her lips consume mine. I find myself instantly rock-hard and she notices.</p><p>She smiles against my lips.</p><p>\u201cI think you liked that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave me away?\u201d I ask with a grin, wedging myself even tighter against her.</p><p>Madison grins back and kisses me again. The second kiss is just as consuming as the first. She seems a little bit desperate, a little bit vulnerable. And a whole lot sexy.</p><p>She slides her hands back up my spine, wrapping her arms around my neck. As she does, I run my palms along her sides, feeling the skin of her back beneath my fingers.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you that my feet hurt? I\u2019d like to take my shoes off.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at her. \u201cSo take them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your place,\u201d she adds.</p><p>I inhale sharply as I grip her hips even tighter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that twice.\u201d</p><p>And she doesn\u2019t. I grab her hand and practically drag her toward the street, hailing a taxi.</p><p>In less than a minute we have tumbled into the back seat of a cab and we\u2019re speeding toward my apartment.</p><p>Madison kisses my neck, tugging at my ear with her teeth as her hands skim my chest. \u201cHow far away do you live?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot very,\u201d I manage to say. I\u2019m actually proud of myself for being able to speak at this point, since her hand has made its way down to my throbbing crotch. I arch my hips so that I am planted more firmly in her hand.</p><p>She licks my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>I can\u2019t take it. I wish she were wearing a skirt, but she\u2019s not. So instead I cup my hand between her legs, moving my thumb in circles against the outside of her pants. She moves against me, moaning.</p> <p>I thrust my hand into the front of her pants, finding her panties completely soaked.</p><p>I slip one finger in.</p><p>And then two.</p><p>Then I withdraw them both and slowly rake them into my mouth.</p><p>Her eyes widen, exhaling a tiny sigh as her fingers clutch me.</p> <p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d I ask her. I don\u2019t know why, but it feels like the right thing to do, to make sure that she\u2019s not. Please say no, I silently urge her as her fingers spin circles around my nipple.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thank Christ. I don\u2019t ask again. Instead I lift her onto my lap and rock her against my body. The friction is both satisfying and frustrating.</p><p>Her eyes widen as I thrust against her through her clothes and she reaches her hand down to skim it over my throbbing dick.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re enormous,\u201d she breathes, her eyes widening in both apprehension and appreciation.</p><p>I grin.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we get to my house, I\u2019m going to fuck you with that,\u201d I tell her in her ear. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth graze my lip, her hips firmly planted against mine. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty sure of yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I smile against her throat before I bite at it.</p><p>\u201cVery sure. In fact, let\u2019s make a deal. If you don\u2019t end up screaming my name within the hour, I\u2019ll buy you breakfast in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She pauses, looking into my eyes. \u201cSounds like I win either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d I manage to say before I plunge my tongue into her mouth again.</p><p>In between panting kisses, Madison manages to ask a question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before. How do I know you\u2019re not a crazy person?\u201d she asks in a near whisper.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d I answer, as I pull up her shirt and suck at her bare nipple, my fingers splayed around her slender rib cage. She arches against me and gasps. \u201cBut I won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d I pause and look up at her. \u201cAnd somehow, I get the feeling that you need this as much as I do. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Madison catches her breath and nods.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer and I don\u2019t ask why. I just wrap my arms around her shoulders and kiss her again.</p><p>I\u2019m inhaling her feminine scent, sucking it down, when I\u2019m startled by the squeal of tires. Before I can even see where it\u2019s coming from, instinct raises the hair on the back of my neck. I shove Madison onto the floor of the taxi and duck down on top of her.</p><p>The impact is shockingly violent.</p><p>There is a crunch of shrieking metal as the door next to me is bashed in and our taxi is flung in a spin across the narrow city street, slamming to a stop against the wall of a nearby building. The car rocks to and fro for a moment, then it is still.</p><p>We\u2018re stunned as we sit for a scant second, trying to wrap our minds around what just happened. Steam and smoke begin to pour out from under the hood of the taxi and the driver stumbles from his seat, opening the door next to Madison.</p><p>\u201cQuick, get out,\u201d he says in a heavy Indian accent. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>I all but shove Madison out ahead of me and then pull her away from the crumpled car. There\u2019s a hissing sound coming from the engine, then a strange crackle. I know what it means. I know from the acrid scent of gasoline that\u2019s stinging my nose.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I snap to Madison, and her heels click loudly on the pavement as we rush to the curb on the other side of the street. We turn when we reach the sidewalk, just in time to see the cabbie duck for cover as the front end of the cab bursts into flames.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Madison breathes, leaning into my arm, shielding her face from the waves of heat that roll over us even from this distance.</p><p>As I watch the orange flames licking the black night, as the heated breeze brushes across my face, it triggers a response in me.</p><p>I feel the now-familiar anxiety coming on and my gut clenches tighter than a vise grip. I can feel my throat begin to close up as it prevents me from getting a full breath.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d I mutter as my chest tightens. Sweat pours down my temples and I wipe at it, squinting as the salt stings my eyes. Madison stares up at me, her eyes filled with concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asks, her fingers trembling as they curl around my arm. \u201cWe can\u2019t leave. I\u2019m pretty sure the police will want to talk to us.\u201d</p><p>She gestures toward the crowd forming, to where cop cars have already begun to congregate. I can see uniformed officers milling about, a couple of them headed our way. Heat from the fire and from my own anxiety begins to overwhelm me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d I mutter again. Her fingers are too tight now, along with everything else... my shirt, my waistband, my shoes. Everything bears down on me in blurs and smells and sounds. I can\u2019t take it. I\u2019m going to fucking explode. Or implode. I yank my arm from her grasp and stalk away.</p><p>The last thing I see before everything turns black is the astonished look on Madison\u2019s face, backlit by the red-and-orange glow of the taxi fire.</p><p>The bad thing caught you.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Madison</p><p>For a brief moment I wonder if the shock of the taxi accident has gotten to me or if I\u2019ve somehow fallen down the rabbit hole.</p><p>The guy standing in front of me has completely melted down, going from ultra-cocky and excruciatingly sexy to a complete panicky mess in literally thirty seconds.</p><p>I don\u2019t even know what to do with him.</p><p>I put my hand on his arm, only to have him shake it off. There\u2019s a wild look in his eye as he spins in a circle, hunting for a way out, his gaze darting around the perimeter of skyscrapers that surround us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d he mumbles for the third time. His eyes have a glazed-over look to them that I\u2019ve never seen before. He starts to walk away and I grab his arm again. There\u2019s no way I can let him walk off in this state. I don\u2019t know him, but I feel a responsibility not to do that.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I tell him quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re got to give our names to the police and then we can go. Do you have an ID with you?\u201d</p><p>He fumbles in his back pocket and hands me his wallet before he sits on the curb, staring off into space, into the flames of the burning cab. After a minute he closes his eyes tightly and drops his head into his hands, as if to shut everything out.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>I watch him hesitantly for just a second before I trot off to give the nearest policeman our IDs. The cop asks me for my contact information, then glances over at Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cIs he all right? Does he need an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>I turn and look. Gabriel is now leaning forward, his head resting on his knees, his eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s hurt,\u201d I answer, even though I honestly have no clue. \u201cI think he just drank too much. We were taking the taxi home from the Underground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart,\u201d the cop tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s too much drunk driving out there. Good to call a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for when the cab explodes,\u201d I mumble as I put my driver\u2019s license back in my purse. The cop smiles wryly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Good point. At least no one was hurt.\u201d</p><p>I eye Gabriel uncertainly as I head back toward him. I\u2019m not too sure about that. He\u2019s still got his eyes closed, but his foot is tapping wildly against the pavement.</p><p>When I reach him, I kneel down in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, did you hit your head in the crash?\u201d</p><p>Because that would make sense. Maybe. Would a concussion cause someone to freak out like this?</p><p>Gabriel looks up at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I need to go home.\u201d He doesn\u2019t even sound like himself now. He\u2019s speaking in a strange monotone, completely unlike the husky sexy voice he had before.</p><p>It\u2019s freaking me out.</p><p>I sigh. Because I can\u2019t leave him here.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d</p><p>He just stares at me.</p><p>I realize that I\u2019m still holding his wallet, so I open it up and look at his driver\u2019s license. His address isn\u2019t that far away. We\u2019re actually within walking distance. Thank God. I don\u2019t want to get into another cab anytime soon.</p><p>Reaching down, I tug on Gabriel\u2019s muscled arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m walking you home.\u201d</p><p>He comes with me without protest, pulling at his collar.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he mutters to me. I look up at him. His collar isn\u2019t too tight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be OK,\u201d I assure him.</p><p>Although I\u2019m not sure of that myself.</p><p>I hold on to his arm, although I don\u2019t know why. After we\u2019ve walked a couple of blocks, Gabriel starts muttering incoherent words under his breath. I can\u2019t understand him, but when I ask him to repeat them, he just looks at me.</p><p>This is seriously freaking me out. I highly doubt I should be walking anywhere alone with this guy. Why in the world didn\u2019t I just tell the cop to deal with him? I\u2019m clearly not equipped to handle this situation.</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone I can call for you?\u201d I ask him, hoping that there is. He just looks at me again, almost like he doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>When I look into his eyes, they are vacant and glassy.</p><p>Like he\u2019s not there.</p><p>I gulp hard.</p><p>Within a minute we\u2019ve reached his building and I\u2019ve never been so happy. A doorman recognizes Gabriel and greets him by name.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not himself,\u201d I say by way of explanation, because I\u2019m honestly not sure what to say. \u201cI\u2019m walking him to his condo. Can you tell me his condo number?\u201d</p><p>The doorman is actually kind enough to walk us up to the condo and then unlock the door for me with his master keys. I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him simply as I walk Gabriel through the door. Gabriel isn\u2019t speaking at all by this point.</p><p>The doorman looks at us.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything else, let me know,\u201d he tells me, staring at Gabriel curiously before he takes his leave.</p><p>That\u2019s interesting. He\u2019s obviously not used to seeing Gabriel like this, so maybe it really was an injury in the accident. Maybe he did hit his head. For a second I wonder if I should call an ambulance.</p><p>But Gabriel is already walking back toward his bedroom, mumbling. I can see his neatly made bed through the open door. I follow along at his heels and almost run into him when he abruptly stops and slams his fist into the wall. His movement is strong and unexpected and packs enormous power. So much power that he shakes the entire hallway and leaves a hole in the wall.</p><p>I gasp and freeze when he turns to me. Fear floods every part of me, every last nook and cranny of me. Because as Gabriel turns his face, a small illogical part of me almost expects to see someone else. Someone terrifying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My father.</p><p>My heart pounds in my ears and memories from long ago flit through my head. Fists and blood and arguments and fear.</p><p>But of course Gabriel isn\u2019t my father. And so I force my breathing to slow and my heart to calm down, even as I balance lightly on the balls of my feet, poised to run if I have to. I swallow as Gabriel looks at me.</p><p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d he tells me. His cheeks are flushed, his eyes are slightly glazed and his hand is still curled into a fist at his side, his knuckles scraped. I eye it and take a step back, because I know what can happen with a fist.</p> <p>\u201cYou hate what?\u201d</p><p>Emotion fills his eyes, something dark, something pained. \u201cI hate the way it controls me.\u201d</p><p>I definitely feel panicked now. \u201cWhat controls you?\u201d</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t answer. He just walks into his room and drops onto his bed. He\u2019s calm now, quiet. As though he didn\u2019t just punch a hole in the wall.</p><p>As though he didn\u2019t just tell me that something controls him.</p> <p>What the fuck is wrong with him?</p><p>Ignoring my still-racing heart, I bend in front of him. I can do this.</p><p>\u201cDoes your head hurt?\u201d I ask him. When he shakes his head, I look into his eyes. His pupils seem the same size. I heard somewhere that if you have a concussion, it makes the sizes of your pupils uneven.</p><p>Physically he seems fine. No bumps, no scrapes, no bruises. I stare down at him uncertainly. He stares back, but it\u2019s like he\u2019s not even seeing me.</p><p>I sigh, long and loud.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get your shirt and jeans off, at least,\u201d I finally tell him. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p> <p>He stands up obediently and unbuttons his pants, letting them drop to the floor. When he sits back down, I strip his shirt off over his head, then fold down the covers on his bed.</p><p>He immediately drops back into it, curling onto his side and closing his eyes.</p><p>As I cover him up, I can\u2019t help but glance at his body. It\u2019s sculpted and cut, and it\u2019s apparent that he works out. A lot. He has the body of a triathlete. Or Olympian. Or Greek god, maybe. He\u2019s got a tattoo on his bicep, a skull wearing a beret over a pair of crossed swords. Words are scrolled above and below it. \u201cDeath Before Dishonor.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Where would he get that? Is he a marine, maybe? He doesn\u2019t have a marine haircut, though.</p><p>I sigh again. This whole turn of events is so unfortunate. If I was gonna have a one-night stand, this was clearly the guy to do it with. He\u2019s freaking hot.</p><p>At this exact moment he moans and thrashes, throwing off the covers as he mutters into his pillow.</p><p>He\u2019s also apparently crazy because something controls him. God. Just my luck. I meet a hot guy who hears voices or some shit. Or he hit his head and he\u2019s just delirious.</p><p>I shake my head as I pick up the covers and pull them back up over him.</p> <p>I take in his clenched jaw and furrowed brow. One part of me wants to call an ambulance to be on the safe side. But another part of me thinks it\u2019s not my place to do that, especially since I don\u2019t know if he needs it. I don\u2019t even know if he has insurance.</p><p>I honestly just don\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>Finally I decide that I\u2019ll hang around for a just a little while, to see if he gets any worse.</p><p>It\u2019s the least I can do. I wouldn\u2019t feel right otherwise. If he wakes up and acts dangerous, I can be out of here in half a minute.</p><p>I find the bathroom so that I can pee and it is surprisingly clean for a guy\u2019s bathroom. It\u2019s decorated in various shades of gray, even a gray-tiled floor. There\u2019s no evidence whatsoever of a woman\u2019s touch, so he must be unattached. Or at the very least unmarried. At least he\u2019s not a scumbag like the married guys who troll the clubs for a piece of ass.</p><p>Out of curiosity I open the medicine cabinet. Q-tips, razor, razor blades, shaving cream, and a bottle of sleeping pills with his name on them. There\u2019s nothing that would suggest that he\u2019s crazy. There\u2019s no psychotropic prescription pills or anything.</p><p>That\u2019s good, right?</p><p>I walk back out into the dining area, looking around with interest. Everything is neat, modern, masculine. On one wall is a mahogany case, as tall as I am. It\u2019s so shallow that it can\u2019t hold much, so it piques my interest. I open it and suck in my breath at the neatly lined-up guns facing me.</p><p>Holy shit. Is he expecting WWIII? Who in the world would have this many guns? He\u2019s crazy after all. As I\u2019m backing away from it, unreasonably afraid of the guns, a certificate catches my eye. It\u2019s lying on a short stack of paper at the end of the black-and-white granite kitchen counter.</p><p>I stop and look at it and find that it is actually a diploma, issued a few years ago by the United States Army Ranger School, and it\u2019s got his name on it.</p><p>Gabriel is a Ranger. Or he was one. One or the other. Either way, that explains the amazingly cut body. And the tattoo. And the guns. Thank God. I feel an incredible amount of relief right now... apparently I\u2019m not in the home of a psychopath.</p><p>Unless he was kicked out for being crazy, which seems like a real possibility at the moment.</p><p>Yikes. I\u2019m suddenly incredibly uncomfortable being here.</p><p>I walk quickly back down to his bedroom, which is decorated just like the rest of his house\u2014gray tones, dark wood, masculine.</p><p>He\u2019s still sleeping and he\u2019s no longer muttering. I stare down at him for a second, watching him breathe.</p><p>He seems fine now.</p><p>Fine enough for me to leave him alone without feeling guilty, anyway.</p><p>Before I can rethink it I\u2019m out the door, down the stairs and on the street again, breathing in the cool night air. When the doorman waves at me, I walk over to him.</p><p>\u201cGabriel isn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be OK, but maybe someone should check on him later. If you know anyone to call, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>The doorman nods and assures me that he\u2019ll take care of it.</p><p>His assurance makes me feel slightly better, but I still feel like I\u2019ve been bitch-slapped by tonight. It\u2019s all been so bizarre.</p><p>But that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s over now. I just have to make my way back to the club, get my car, and then leave all this weirdness behind me. In a few minutes the crazy hot guy will be a distant memory.</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>I wake up in a cold sweat.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure where I am.</p><p>This isn\u2019t unusual, so I force my breathing to slow, to regulate. I need to gain my bearings.</p><p>I glance around, at the gray walls of my stark bedroom, at the white ceiling, at the familiar ceiling fan with the blades that look like large wicker leaves.</p><p>I\u2019m in my apartment. In my bed. One glance at the clock tells me that four hours have passed since the last time I was conscious.</p><p>The problem is, I have no idea how I fucking got here.</p><p>My hands are shaky as I reach for the glass of water on my bedside table, swirling the water inside the glass as I force myself to calm, as I try not to remember the nightmare that woke me. I take a gulp and force the blurs of reds and blacks out of my head, even though I know from experience they are unwilling to go.</p><p>Darkness and blood.</p><p>These are two things that will apparently always haunt me. I doubt I\u2019ll ever get a full night\u2019s rest, or that I\u2019ll ever feel comfortable in the dark again.</p><p>I slump against the pillows, then startle as I remember Madison.</p><p>The beautiful girl from the club.</p><p>We were on our way here when we were in a car accident. I hold up my hands and look at them, barely able to see them in the dim light streaming through the window. I seem to be fine, nothing on my body hurts, so apparently we weren\u2019t injured. Or I wasn\u2019t, at least.</p><p>I honestly don\u2019t know about Madison. There\u2019s no possible way I can because I don\u2019t even know how I made it home. I hope she\u2019s all right. But I don\u2019t fucking know. Everything is a black void. All I know for sure is that I\u2019m alone now.</p><p>I left Madison there, standing next to the twisted, burning wreck of our taxi. Even though I can\u2019t recall much else, I remember the stricken look on her face as she realized that I was leaving.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ashamed of myself or relieved. She was pretty fucking amazing. And pretty fucking hot. But there\u2019s no way she should get mixed up with someone like me, even for only one night. Especially for only one night. I might look normal, but I\u2019m far from it.</p><p>I think back to Madison\u2019s question in the cab.</p><p>How do I know you\u2019re not a crazy person?</p><p>I almost smile grimly in the dark.</p><p>I\u2019m not crazy... exactly. The army doctors say I just need time. They call it PTSD. Posttraumatic stress disorder. I call it something else entirely: fucked up.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Madison</p><p>I open my bleary eyes, not exactly sure what woke me from my dead sleep.</p><p>The lake crashes against the shore outside, but that\u2019s not it. I\u2019m used to that sound since I hear it every night. The rain is slanting against my bedroom windows, but that\u2019s not it either. As I gaze at the ceiling, my phone buzzes, vibrating from my nightstand with a text message.</p><p>Ah, that\u2019s it. Mystery solved.</p><p>I rub my eyes, glare at the clock (which surely must be wrong because there\u2019s no way it\u2019s that late), then grab the stupid phone.</p><p>Where are u? Where did you go last night?</p><p>Staring at the words, I cringe with guilt.</p><p>Craaaaaap.</p><p>Jacey. The friend I left at the Underground last night, the friend who just happens to work for me. She\u2019s the best waitress I\u2019ve got, mainly because she\u2019s just the right mix of charm and flirtation. She\u2019s also the best friend I\u2019ve got, mainly because I don\u2019t get close to that many people.</p><p>I never found her last night and then I completely forgot about her... because I was distracted. My distraction flashes through my head, a vision of Gabriel\u2019s face and muscled body, and my cheeks flush. I quickly put him out of my mind and turn back to my phone.</p><p>I\u2019m a bad friend, I text her back simply. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Where did you go????</p><p>Apparently I\u2019m not going to get off that easily. I sigh.</p><p>Remember when u said I needed to get laid? Well, I almost did. But didn\u2019t. So I came home alone instead. Did you just go home with Peter? I would\u2019ve called, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t hear your phone.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s face pops unbidden into my head again. The look on his face while we watched that taxi burn was indescribable. Tortured, almost. But that sounds stupid to say.</p><p>Obviously I was in shock too. It\u2019s not every day that you get nailed in an intersection and then your taxi explodes into flames. So of course I was disturbed.</p><p>But not to the degree that Gabriel was. For some reason my heart twinges just thinking about it, but I ignore it. I don\u2019t know him and there\u2019s no use wondering what the hell was wrong with him. He\u2019s irrelevant now. I force him out of my thoughts and wait for Jacey to reply.</p><p>It only takes her a second.</p><p>You should definitely be sorry. I was almost worried. And why didn\u2019t u get some??? Any man would give his left nut to take you home. I\u2019m pretty sure I hate you for that.</p><p>I have to smile. Jacey wasn\u2019t worried. I\u2019m sure of it. She probably didn\u2019t even realize I was gone until it was time to go home.</p><p>Long story, I answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One beat passes and then she replies.</p><p>K. My brother never showed up last night, but he\u2019s coming to the Hill tonight to bring me my bday gift. You can meet him then.</p><p>I smile, which hurts my pounding head. I\u2019m glad she mentioned it. I\u2019d forgotten it was her birthday. Maybe I really am a bad friend.</p><p>Fine, I tell her. You\u2019re not going to let up until I meet him, I know. And I\u2019m bringing you a birthday cupcake.</p> <p>One pause, then an answer.</p><p>My diet doesn\u2019t thank you. But I do!</p><p>I toss my phone onto the foot of the bed and settle back into my pillow for a second. My head doesn\u2019t hurt because of drinking. I only had one drink last night. It\u2019s pounding because of lack of sleep. I didn\u2019t get in until four thirty a.m. And that\u2019s very unlike me. I glance at the clock again.</p><p>Nine a.m.</p><p>Normally I would already be at my restaurant, the Hill, by now. But I\u2019m dying from sleep deprivation. If I don\u2019t consume a massive amount of caffeine, I might murder someone later.</p> <p>I throw the covers back on my little double bed, the same one that I had all through high school. I barely spare a glance at the walls covered in old posters and high school news articles. I inherited my childhood home a couple of years ago. One of these days I need to get off my ass and clean this room out.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to worry about it today, though.</p><p>Today I just need coffee.</p><p>I pad down the long hall to the kitchen, where I start the coffee and make a frozen burrito. I sit eating it in my underwear, something I can do since I live alone. My eating habits are shit, which is ironic since I own a restaurant, something else I inherited.</p><p>After two cups of coffee loaded with sugar and cream, I finally feel human again. I take a quick shower, twist my hair into a sloppy bun and throw on a pair of capris, a polo and a sweater before I grab one more cup of coffee on my way out the door.</p><p>I button my sweater up as I jab at the button that lowers the top on my convertible, my one luxury. Driving with the wind in my hair is the only freedom I really get to experience and since the spring rain has stopped for a minute, I can ride with the top down today.</p> <p>I shift into gear and back out of my driveway, starting down the narrow road that winds along Lake Michigan. It\u2019s a fun little road and I used to love driving it, back before it killed my parents.</p><p>Today the morning sun is bright and the ground is wet from rain. As the light rebounds from the misty surface of the lake and directly onto the glass of my windshield, I squint while I reach for the volume on my car stereo. The ridged knob slides in my fingers as I crank it up.</p><p>I almost sigh aloud. That\u2019s better. There\u2019s nothing like coffee and loud music to jar me from sleepiness. I punch at the button to change the satellite radio station as I glance up into the sun.</p><p>The light is in my eyes, bright and sharp.</p><p>I blink, but before I can really refocus, I realize exactly where I am. I\u2019m coming up way too fast on a hairpin curve.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I gasp and yank on the wheel, spilling hot coffee between my legs as my car veers sharply from the road. Everything seems to happen in slow motion as my car careens into the ditch, skidding sideways at an unnatural angle toward the beach below.</p><p>I\u2019m almost frozen, blinded by the sun and completely at the mercy of Newton\u2019s laws of motion as my car slides through the mud, the wet grass hitting it in a thumping hiss as the bottom of the hill rushes to meet me.</p> <p>I\u2019m at such an unnatural angle and skidding so fast that I\u2019m afraid for a second that the car is going to roll, but it doesn\u2019t. Instead it slams to an unceremonious stop at the bottom, the wheels halfway buried in the wet sand of the beach. I\u2019m flustered as I try to take deep breaths, yet somehow remain breathless as I sit frozen in shock.</p><p>Holy shit. What the hell just happened? Was I seriously in my second car accident in as many days?</p><p>My hands shake as I look around. I didn\u2019t hit anyone or anything.</p><p>I\u2019m not hurt.</p><p>I\u2019m not hurt.</p><p>I chant this silently to myself as I look around. I\u2019m at the bottom of the incline leading up to the road, in the middle of rocks and grass and sand. I\u2019m so stupid. I\u2019ve driven this road a thousand times. I knew better.</p><p>Even though my hands are shaking and I can\u2019t breathe, everything\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. My car is fine. I\u2019m not my parents. Unlike them, I didn\u2019t die. There is no broken glass or blood. I\u2019m fine.</p><p>I think.</p><p>I open the door and step directly down into calf-deep mud.</p><p>Hell. I cringe as I pull my foot back up, glancing at my mud-covered paisley Jimmy Choo wedge. Shoes are my weakness and this one, which had been practically brand-new, is now ruined.</p><p>Efffffff.</p><p>As if that\u2019s not bad enough, I\u2019m surrounded by mud, a result of last night\u2019s thunderstorm. I can\u2019t get out to check my car, but from where I can see, the left front wheel is bent under. I have no idea if it\u2019s even drivable.</p><p>With a scowl I press the accelerator and attempt to drive back up the incline, but my car won\u2019t budge. The bent wheel won\u2019t even turn.</p><p>I\u2019m stuck. Not just stuck, but firmly and completely stuck.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>My head drops to my steering wheel as my fingers reach for my cell phone.</p><p>When my sister comes to my rescue twenty minutes later, she rushes to get to me, picking her way down the wet hill. Her descent isn\u2019t graceful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mila. Go back up!\u201d I lean out my window and call out to her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fall and break something, preggo!\u201d</p><p>She scowls at me as she walks toward the car, stopping where the mud pools start.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Not you too. Pax will barely let me lift a finger to do anything. You\u2019re a woman. You should know better. I\u2019m pregnant, not an invalid.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I take off my shoes and grab my purse. As carefully as I can, I step from the car, instantly sinking ankle-deep in the mud. I slam my car door closed hard.</p><p>\u201cYour husband just wants to take care of you,\u201d I remind her grumpily as I slog through the mud toward her.</p><p>At seven months pregnant, Mila has that mythical glow about her that few pregnant women actually get. In fact, pregnancy truly agrees with her. She\u2019s always been gorgeous, but now she literally glows. Her long dark hair is lush and shiny, her cheeks pink and flushed, and her skin flawless.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you look so good,\u201d I grumble as I eye her tiny baby bump. \u201cIt\u2019s sickening. You\u2019ve barely gained any weight at all.\u201d</p><p>She holds out her hand to help me over a rock and laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want me to look hideous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I answer with a mock scowl as we carefully make our way to the top of the hill to where Mila\u2019s car awaits. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re prettier than me even while you\u2019re pregnant. Big sisters are always supposed to be hotter. It\u2019s a law of nature. I didn\u2019t make the rules, Mila, but we should definitely follow them. Try to gain a few pounds.\u201d</p><p>She laughs again and rolls her eyes as we buckle ourselves in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, Mad. You\u2019re the model in our family. The only things I have that you don\u2019t are bigger boobs. And you can\u2019t have those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mutter as I flip the visor down and look at myself. \u201cI\u2019m not a model anymore.\u201d</p><p>I have mud splatters on my forehead. And mud caked almost up to my knees. It drips onto the floor and I sigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re going to have to get this thing detailed now,\u201d I tell her apologetically. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assures me, serious now. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re all right. How the hell did this even happen, Maddy? You know how dangerous this road is.\u201d</p><p>Of course I know.</p><p>I feel guilty at the worried strain in her voice. I feel guilty that she had to come here, to this particular curve of all places.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d I answer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mi. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d</p><p>She glances at me. \u201cI know. Just be more careful. I almost had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Her and me both.</p><p>I lean my head back against my seat, still shaky from sliding down the hill. The aftereffects of the adrenaline rush aren\u2019t being kind to me. My heart is still pounding, my hands and legs still shaking. I stare at the ground from my window and the vehicle is so tall, it\u2019s a long way down.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe Pax made you get this thing,\u201d I chuckle, trying to lighten the mood. \u201cIt\u2019s so... not you.\u201d Mila rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know. The minute he found out I was pregnant, he went out and bought the safest vehicle he could find. This thing is practically bulletproof. It might actually be a tank in disguise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handle everything so much better than I do,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI would hate being controlled like that.\u201d</p><p>Mila laughs again, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being controlled. When you\u2019re married, sometimes you have to compromise. And this wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. Yes, my little car got better gas mileage, but it makes Pax happy to think that I\u2019m safer. And besides, I can fit more of my art supplies in here anyway. So there\u2019s an upside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to lug art supplies around anymore,\u201d I tell her, one eyebrow raised. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep your art shop. Since Pax is taking over his grandpa\u2019s company soon, you\u2019d never have to work again if you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Mila rolls her eyes as she turns onto a city street. The big SUV barely even shudders as she runs over a piece of leftover winter ice.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know I\u2019ve got to create art. If I don\u2019t have an outlet for it, I\u2019ll go insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane already,\u201d I answer. \u201cFor agreeing to move to Connecticut.\u201d</p><p>She glances at me. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t want to go either. But that\u2019s where Alexander Holdings\u2019 headquarters is at. Pax can\u2019t take over for his grandpa from here. And his grandpa really wants to retire. So it\u2019s something Pax has to do. I\u2019ve got to support that.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cAnother one of those marriage compromises?\u201d</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I sigh again. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that your marriage isn\u2019t really working for me. You\u2019re going to have to get divorced.\u201d</p><p>Mila bursts out laughing. \u201cCan\u2019t. We have a prenup. I can\u2019t get rich that way.\u201d</p><p>This makes me laugh. Mila is the furthest thing from a gold digger I\u2019ve ever seen. And I personally know there wasn\u2019t a prenup.</p><p>I feel the onset of a tension headache, stemming from my stupid car accident and my stupid lack of sleep. I rub at my forehead before the stupid tension wrinkles become permanent. I scowl because everything is starting to feel stupid this morning.</p><p>Mila notices.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in such a bad mood?\u201d she asks curiously. \u201cYou weren\u2019t hurt. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve called a tow truck. You\u2019ll have your car back in a bit. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>I adjust the radio and then settle back into my seat, watching the scenery as Mila turns onto the lakefront drive that houses our restaurant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I admit. \u201cI guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201d I don\u2019t bother telling her why, because she\u2019d just be immediately and insanely interested. She\u2019s been wanting me to go out for months and I don\u2019t want to tell her what a bust it was.</p><p>\u201cWell, cheer up,\u201d Mila tells me as she pulls into the parking lot of the Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. Life is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer grumpily. \u201cLife is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re lucky,\u201d she prompts me. \u201cYou could\u2019ve been hurt and you weren\u2019t. You know as well as I do that that road is dangerous.\u201d She\u2019s serious now and I know why. I can practically see the memories in her eyes... of our parents\u2019 twisted car, their funeral, the overwhelming horrible grief.</p> <p>I gulp, then nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was lucky. Are you coming in?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ve got a doctor\u2019s appointment and then I have to get back to my shop. I\u2019ll catch up with you later. I think we\u2019re coming here for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019K. I\u2019ll save a table for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Thanks! Talk to you tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Mila waves as she backs the giant black SUV out. I wave back limply. God, I\u2019m going to miss her when she moves. It\u2019s only she and I now. We don\u2019t have any other relatives. Well, we have Pax. So it\u2019s just the three of us.</p><p>I sigh, but put it out of my mind. They aren\u2019t moving until summer. I\u2019ll worry about it when the time comes.</p><p>For now, I head into the little stucco Italian bistro on the shoreline where I\u2019ve spent every waking hour for the past couple of years. The Hill was my parents\u2019 dream, not mine. They worked day and night for years to make it a success and when they died, Mila and I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of closing it.</p><p>But I swear to God. Some days, I get so pissed off that I gave up my life for this... that I\u2019m confined to a little lakeside town, living someone else\u2019s dream. There are days when it sucks the lifeblood out of me and I feel so much older than I am.</p><p>And some days I feel so much younger... because I don\u2019t always have the answers to every problem that I face.</p><p>I have no fricking idea how to run a business. My business degree is a piece of paper. It didn\u2019t prepare me for a business loan, running a staff, or ordering massive amounts of food. But I can never say that out loud, because as a business owner and a big sister, I\u2019m always expected to have answers.</p> <p>The right ones.</p><p>No one needs to know that I really don\u2019t know shit\u2014that I drift along in life without any real answers. No one needs to know that there are times when I seriously hate how things turned out, and that I\u2019m powerless to change it.</p><p>I sigh and head inside.</p><p>The Hill might seem like a prison sometimes, but it\u2019s a prison that pays the bills.</p><p>One of the worst things about running a business is all the freaking paperwork and red tape. Sometimes I actually have nightmares that I\u2019m drowning in a sea of paper.</p><p>Today I barricade myself behind a wall of it, barely lifting my head until Tony, the bartender who has been with our family since my parents opened the place, pokes his unruly head into my office.</p><p>\u201cMadison, did you get your car all taken care of?\u201d</p><p>I barely glance up from yesterday\u2019s tickets, which I\u2019m tallying. \u201cYeah. They\u2019re towing it in and bringing me a loaner to use for the next couple of days.\u201d</p> <p>Tony nods. \u201cGood. They\u2019ll get you squared away. For now, though, you\u2019ve got to come eat. I mean it. The dinner rush is going to start soon. You\u2019re going to waste away to nothing and your father will haunt me until the end of time if I don\u2019t take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I look away from the schedule for next week and into Tony\u2019s concerned face. At forty, he really doesn\u2019t look a day over thirty. But I\u2019ll never tell him that. As a fiery Italian, he has an ego that\u2019s already big enough.</p><p>\u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t be the one haunting you about my eating habits,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt would be my mother. And I don\u2019t think you want to mess with her.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and agrees.</p><p>\u201cFor sure. Your mother was a force to be reckoned with. The only one who could really control her was your dad.\u201d</p><p>I pause for a moment, my fingers frozen on my desk. Tony\u2019s eyes are gleaming with amusement and I know it\u2019s because he has no idea exactly how my father controlled my mother. No one knew.</p><p>No one except me and Mila. I swallow hard and smile at Tony, forcing the ugly thoughts out of my head. My parents are dead. There is no reason to think about the past.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>He lifts a bushy black eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019d better be. Jacey just clocked in and I made her favorite cherry tarts for her birthday. As far as she\u2019s concerned, it was your idea. You\u2019ve at least got to come have one with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d I mutter. I look up to meet Tony\u2019s accusing stare. \u201cIn my defense, I was going to get her cupcakes on the way to work, but then I almost drove my car into the lake. So I think I get a pass. Don\u2019t judge.\u201d</p><p>I turn my nose up and he almost grins, but doesn\u2019t because he has a cranky image to uphold.</p><p>He turns and saunters away, muttering something about women drivers and whipping me to within an inch of my life if I don\u2019t do what I\u2019m told. I can do nothing but follow him, laughing. He\u2019d never harm a hair on my head and woe to anyone who ever did, because he\u2019d break their kneecaps (mainly because he thinks that\u2019s what an Italian should do).</p><p>He leads me to the outdoor patio, which is situated on the beach directly behind the Hill. Stringed lights and lanterns crisscross over our heads, and soon the honeysuckle on the trellises will start to bloom. At night it\u2019s magically romantic out here, particularly with the majestic view of Lake Michigan and the sweet scent of the honeysuckle. Tourists love it and so do I.</p><p>Right now a tray of Tony\u2019s famous tarts and a birthday card with Jacey\u2019s name on it sit on a table, along with three salads.</p><p>I turn to him in appreciation. \u201cThank you, Tony. You know I love you.\u201d</p><p>He grins now and wraps a meaty paw around my shoulder, squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re busy,\u201d he tells me gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>But it is. He was hired on years ago as the bartender, but since my parents died, he\u2019s helped me in so many different ways. He still tends bar, but he helps me keep everything else in line. He even oversees the cooks and makes special desserts from time to time. I would be lost without him and both of us know it.</p><p>The evening breeze is blowing the hair off my face when Jacey bursts through the doors, her brown eyes sparkling in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect day to have a birthday,\u201d she announces, and like always, I have to admire her.</p><p>Jacey looks at life with childlike wonderment, something I\u2019ve always loved about her. She can make even the most boring thing fun.</p><p>We\u2019ve been friends since we were teenagers. She used to spend the summers here with her grandparents and one day she breezed into the Hill with them for lunch and breezed out with a summer job. She\u2019s been with us every summer since then. She\u2019s fun, she\u2019s carefree, and even though it\u2019s gotten her into trouble from time to time, she\u2019s a refreshing change from the mundane.</p><p>I cherish that even more now that I am the queen of mundane.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday,\u201d I tell her as Tony hands her the card. She grins and opens it, finding a hundred-dollar gift certificate from Tony and me for a massage in town. I mouth Thank you to Tony as Jacey throws her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she squeals. \u201cYou have no idea how stressed out I\u2019ve been. I need this.\u201d</p><p>She releases me and hugs Tony, then digs into her tarts, inhaling three of them before she glances at her watch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gotta hurry,\u201d she tells us. \u201cWe\u2019re booked solid tonight. You\u2019re probably going to have to help out on the floor, Maddy, which is fine because you definitely look comfortable enough. You\u2019re taking business casual to a whole new level.\u201d Jacey looks at my clothes curiously and I sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhen don\u2019t I help out on the floor?\u201d I demand. \u201cI\u2019m out there every day. I have the blisters to prove it. And I\u2019m dressed like this because I got all muddy on my way to work and had to change into my gym clothes. \u201d</p><p>Jacey grins, her eyes sparkling. \u201cWell, with bike shorts and a little bitty T like that, I\u2019m sure the guys will be leaving you big tips. So there\u2019s a plus.\u201d</p><p>I groan and swat at her before I turn to follow her inside, but Tony snags my elbow and points at my salad.</p><p>\u201cEat.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him and from the look on his face I know it\u2019s useless to argue. I bend and shovel five bites into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGood?\u201d I ask with my mouth full as I wipe at it with a napkin.</p><p>He gives me a dubious look and I take two more bites before I scoop up my plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat the rest later,\u201d I promise him. He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d he sighs. \u201cYou\u2019ll go home and eat a frozen burrito.\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t see me grinning as he follows me inside, which is probably a good thing. I absolutely hate being told what to do, which is probably a result of watching my father boss my mother around with his fist for years, but I don\u2019t mind Tony\u2019s fussing.</p><p>For all Tony\u2019s gruffness, he\u2019s got a heart of gold, and he tries his hardest to watch out for both Mila and me. He\u2019s the closest thing to family that we have now.</p><p>As we walk back into the dining room, we are just in time to meet Mila and Pax coming in the front doors. Pax holds Mila\u2019s elbow as she trips over the doormat.</p><p>I have to laugh at the stricken expression on his face. I think Pax would pick Mila up and carry her for the next four months if he thought he could get away with it. He\u2019s been more than a little overprotective lately. And as I stare at his tough exterior, it\u2019s so hard to believe that it\u2019s true, but it is.</p><p>My brother-in-law is like a rock-hard, tattooed sex god or something. Seriously, the guy exudes sex appeal. My first thought when I first met him was Holy shit, he\u2019s trouble. And he really was.</p><p>Pax grins at me now, his hazel eyes twinkling.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like, Mad?\u201d he teases. And I realize that I\u2019ve been staring. I grin back, not at all chagrined.</p><p>\u201cYes, surprisingly enough. I do like you, little brother. Who would\u2019ve thunk it?\u201d Being the protective older sister, I told Mila to stay away from Pax, and of course that made her even more attracted to him. He had that bad-boy thing going on, that cocky attitude and dangerous demeanor that Mila couldn\u2019t resist. Pax\u2019s issues had issues, and he and Mila went through hell and high water together, but they stuck it out.</p><p>Pax shakes his head. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s hard to believe you ever misjudged this awesomeness.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and lead them to a table, chatting with them while they get settled. Pax pulls out Mila\u2019s chair and drops her napkin onto her lap for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you going to chew her food for her too, or...?\u201d I raise my eyebrow but Pax just grins.</p><p>\u201cHappy wife, happy life,\u201d he rattles off as he sits down. \u201cIt\u2019s something I live by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re very good at it,\u201d Mila commends him, but her eyes are frozen with interest on something behind me. \u201cMaddy, isn\u2019t that Ethan Eldridge?\u201d</p><p>I turn to see my hostess, Julie, seating our old childhood friend at a small table by the window.</p> <p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d I answer. \u201cI think it is. I haven\u2019t seen him since he went off to med school. He never came home for the summers. His mom used to come in here and complain about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks good,\u201d Mila says, pointing out the obvious. I stare at him, taking in his blond hair and blue eyes, and his lanky, lean frame. \u201cYou should go talk to him. That\u2019s your job, anyway. You need to make him feel welcome.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at her. \u201cI\u2019m not going over there and flirting with him. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say flirt,\u201d Mila answers innocently. \u201cI said talk. He always had a thing for you, though. And you do need a social life.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m just debating whether to stab her in the eye with a fork when Ethan glances up and notices me. He gives me an excited wave.</p> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d I mutter, as Mila crows triumphantly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to deal with you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I can hear her laughing as I make my way over to Ethan.</p><p>\u201cMadison.\u201d He smiles, reminding me exactly how gorgeous his smile is. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always here,\u201d I tell him wryly. \u201cI think I practically live here. Are you back for good? I thought I\u2019d heard that you were coming back to the ob-gyn department at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>He smiles again and I briefly wonder why I don\u2019t feel a reaction. Is it because I\u2019ve known him so long?</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. If you ever want to switch from Dr. Hall to me, I\u2019m sure I can make your yearly exams much more pleasant for you.\u201d He waggles his eyebrows in the ridiculous way I remember, and for a minute he seems just like the kid I knew in high school.</p> <p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s just what I want. The guy who vomited up his chocolate milk on me in kindergarten doing my pap smear. Besides, you\u2019re not even a real doctor yet, are you? And I\u2019ve had Dr. Hall for years. So... it\u2019s not gonna happen. Your hands aren\u2019t getting anywhere near this.\u201d I gesture toward my downstairs area and he shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, though. It\u2019s been forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a real doctor. I\u2019m a resident doctor. That counts, you little brat. I can even prescribe medicine and shit. But whatever. It\u2019s good to see you too. You look fantastic, exactly the same as you did the day we graduated high school.\u201d</p><p>I grin at his compliment. \u201cThanks, Ethan. I\u2019ve been feeling old lately, so that\u2019s good to hear. You look pretty good too.\u201d</p><p>He throws his most charming smile at me. \u201cWe need to sit down and catch up sometime soon, Mad. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>I stare down at him, trying to see him in the way any other female would.</p><p>He\u2019s tall, at least six-two, blond and blue-eyed. He looks like a descendent of Vikings or something. Well, without the muscles of a Viking. We\u2019d make gorgeous babies together, if I\u2019m honest. But I\u2019ve known him since preschool, which means that I know all the dumbass stuff he did between then and now. I still vividly remember him eating a grasshopper on a dare in fourth grade. His tongue isn\u2019t getting anywhere near mine, doctor or not.</p><p>He winks and I shake my head. I\u2019m just getting ready to tell him how terrifying it is that people are putting their health in his hands when the restaurant door opens, letting a slice of sunlight in to shine across the floor. I follow the light to the man who just walked in from the rain. He\u2019s sliding his cell phone into the pocket of his jacket.</p> <p>He looks up and his eyes meet mine and there\u2019s no way in hell.</p><p>No effing way in hell.</p><p>My heart is slamming a million miles an hour in my chest.</p><p>Because it\u2019s Gabriel.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be fucking kidding me. The universe obviously has a strange sense of humor. After lusting after this girl last night and wondering what happened to her all day today, I\u2019m now standing face-to-face with her? What are the odds of that?</p><p>Pretty fucking small.</p><p>Yet there she is.</p><p>Madison stares at me in shock as she stands next to a guy dressed in fancy jeans and a button-up shirt. The guy is clearly a candy-ass, but he\u2019s not my concern.</p><p>I\u2019m totally fixated on Madison: her wide eyes, her mouth slightly open.</p><p>That\u2019s exactly how I feel. But unlike her, I manage to keep the surprise off my face.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to process the crazy coincidence of us meeting like this, the second meeting in two days, when I see my sister emerge from a back hall, carrying a large tray of drinks. As Jacey glances up at me, everything suddenly clicks together and makes perfect sense.</p><p>Jacey mentioned that she was going to bring a friend with her to the club last night.</p><p>And Jacey has told me about her boss before, a supposedly cool girl who had to grow up way too soon for reasons that I don\u2019t remember right now. What I do remember is that she called her Maddy.</p><p>Maddy is Madison.</p><p>Jacey is the common thread, the root of this unholy coincidence.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I shake my head and watch while Jacey sets her tray down and bounds across the room to grab me in a bear hug.</p><p>\u201cGabriel!\u201d she squeals. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got here. I\u2019ve missed your ugly face.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but hug her back, even though I\u2019m annoyed about the whole Madison thing. I almost feel like Jacey finagled all of this on purpose, but I know that can\u2019t be right. There\u2019s no way she could\u2019ve arranged our meeting behind the club.</p><p>I can feel Madison\u2019s cool stare, but I refuse to look up and meet it because I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s annoyed or intrigued that I\u2019ve intruded upon her life.</p><p>For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember much after that fucking taxi accident last night. It was a total blackout, the first one I\u2019ve had in months.</p><p>I don\u2019t remember what I said to her, I don\u2019t remember how I acted around her, I can\u2019t remember shit. I do have strange little flashes of Madison tucking me into bed, but I don\u2019t know if those are real memories or if my mind was just playing tricks on me. You never know with me, not when I\u2019m in that fucked-up state.</p><p>But if it was real, I hate that she saw me like that. It\u2019s humiliating, which is as good a reason as any to ignore her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sis,\u201d I murmur into Jacey\u2019s blonde hair. \u201cHappy birthday! You smell like spaghetti.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes and lets go of me, turning to Madison.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, you\u2019ve got to come and finally meet my brother.\u201d</p><p>Madison looks stricken, but she manages to put one foot in front of the other, leaving the candy-ass\u2019s side to stand reluctantly in front of me.</p><p>Even though I\u2019m uncomfortable about this myself, I fight the urge to laugh at the distinct expression of discomfort on her gorgeous face. No matter what else she might be feeling, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s not sure how to handle this situation, just as it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s not used to not being in control. She has no idea what to say to me. At all.</p><p>It\u2019s pretty fucking funny.</p><p>\u201cThis is my brother Gabriel.\u201d Jacey looks up at me proudly. \u201cHe just got back from Afghanistan a few months ago and he\u2019s hardly made the time to come see his poor little sister. Gabriel, this is my friend\u2014and boss\u2014Madison. You\u2019ve heard all about her.\u201d</p><p>Madison\u2019s blue eyes are frozen on me, a question gleaming in them.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>I can hear it just as clearly as if she\u2019d said the words. And it makes me wonder again just how much she saw last night. It puts me on the defensive and I smirk, just to prove that none of it matters.</p><p>When Madison sees it, her eyes harden even more.</p><p>Jacey stares from Madison to me.</p><p>\u201cUm. Aren\u2019t you going to say anything? \u2018Nice to meet you,\u2019 maybe? What\u2019s wrong with you two? Did I miss something?\u201d</p><p>Madison finally blinks and breaks our gaze, glancing at Jacey.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, nice to meet you.\u201d She looks uncertain of what to say next so I clear my throat.</p><p>I don\u2019t see the point in mentioning what happened last night. Or what almost happened. Mentioning any part of it would open a can of worms that I don\u2019t want to discuss.</p><p>Madison looks grateful for a moment before her face closes up and she turns cool once again. For some reason, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s her normal persona... cool and collected.</p><p>It seems very her.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019s being cold because she\u2019s mad that I left her at the accident? I internally flinch. I hate that I did that. It was a dick thing to do. But I wasn\u2019t myself. If she\u2019s judging me for that, fuck her. She doesn\u2019t know shit.</p><p>I grin widely to show her that she\u2019s not always in control.</p><p>Because that\u2019s very me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to formally meet you, Madison. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. Some of it was even good.\u201d</p><p>Jacey gasps and punches me, but I ignore her quick protests about how everything was good and how she\u2019d never say anything bad about Madison. I even ignore her whining about how my arm hurt her hand.</p><p>Instead I glance down and notice the way Madison\u2019s chest fills out her snug T-shirt, and I briefly flash back to the way her nipples tasted in my mouth, pink and sweet. My groin tightens and I quickly return my attention to the present as Madison slides her slender hand into mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d she answers coolly. \u201cAnd Jacey, don\u2019t worry. I know you only say good things about me. Your brother was just joking, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>I swallow a snort, but Jacey looks appeased.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Maddy,\u201d she mutters. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t used to be so rude. He\u2019s still adjusting from being overseas.\u201d</p><p>Anger flashes through me, quick and hot, but I tamp it down. I meant to be a little rude. I can\u2019t get mad for being called out on it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be back to normal soon,\u201d I agree with her smoothly before I change the subject. \u201cDo you have a table for me? We\u2019re gonna need a table for three. Brand\u2019s coming too.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s face lights up at the mention of our childhood friend.</p><p>\u201cThank God! I haven\u2019t seen him in at least a month. You both suck at coming to see me. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\u201d She turns to Madison. \u201cCan I give them the window table in the corner?\u201d</p><p>Madison nods.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It was nice to meet you, Gabriel. I hope you enjoy your meal.\u201d</p><p>She abruptly turns and joins a couple at a different table. Not that I\u2019m going to show it, but I\u2019m a little flabbergasted at the change in her. This cool, unflappable woman is nothing like the hot-blooded chick I met last night. I find myself staring at her tight ass for a minute, wondering how such a small ass fits such a big stick in it. I\u2019m chuckling at the thought as Jacey leads me to my table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring you a beer,\u201d Jacey tells me as she hands me a menu and eyes the wrapped gift that I set on the table next to me. \u201cWhat will Brand want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beer is fine,\u201d I tell her as I look over the food selection. \u201cThanks, Sis.\u201d</p><p>She nods as she leaves and I glance around.</p><p>The restaurant is nice, although Madison doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of person who would own a restaurant. At least she didn\u2019t seem that way last night. Today, though, who knows? I think about it for a second, and vaguely remember Jacey telling me that Maddy inherited it from her parents. That would make more sense.</p> <p>Turning slightly, I find her in my periphery. Her light blonde hair is easy to find. Whereas last night she was dressed like a runway model, today she\u2019s wearing workout clothes\u2014tiny tight shorts, a tiny shirt that leaves nothing to the imagination and tennis shoes. It\u2019s strange as fuck. It\u2019s like she\u2019s done a complete about-face.</p><p>So who is the real Madison? The sexy siren who wanted to go home with me last night or this tightly wound business owner?</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s tightly wound during the day and a siren in the sack?</p><p>It seems like something that I should make it my mission to find out.</p><p>She\u2019s sitting with her little group now: a gorgeous dark-haired woman and a muscular tattooed guy. She\u2019s also purposely not looking at me, I can tell. Her shoulders are angled away from me and she\u2019s laughing at everything her companions say, as if to show me what a good time she\u2019s having.</p> <p>And no, I\u2019m not egotistical for thinking that her behavior revolves around me. At this moment, her behavior is revolving around me. She\u2019s as acutely aware of where I am in this room as I am of her. Every so often I can see her sneaking sideways glances at me. She\u2019s probably wondering about the real me, just like I\u2019m wondering about the real her. If she saw much of my episode last night, if it was bad, then she\u2019s probably trying to figure me out right this minute.</p><p>Since I can\u2019t remember what happened last night, there\u2019s only one thing I can do.</p><p>Fuck with her.</p><p>Prove to her that I\u2019m not a pussy. Stare at her until she squirms in her seat, as she remembers exactly what we almost did last night, what she begged me to do. Show her that she doesn\u2019t have the upper hand with me just because I can\u2019t remember what I did.</p><p>Grinning to myself, I switch seats so that I\u2019m squarely facing her. And then I pointedly stare at her.</p><p>This should prove entertaining.</p> <p>Madison</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>My cheeks flush hotly as I feel Gabriel\u2019s stare burning into me from across the room. How in the name of all that is holy did I not notice that his last name was the same as Jacey\u2019s when I looked at his driver\u2019s license last night? That accident must\u2019ve shaken me up even more than I realized. And why the hell is he staring at me? He\u2019s acting like nothing happened last night at all, like he didn\u2019t totally lose his shit. What am I supposed to do with that?</p><p>Even though he\u2019s very obviously trying to draw my attention, there\u2019s no way in hell that I\u2019m going to acknowledge it. I\u2019d rather die before I give him the satisfaction of looking at him. Instead I concentrate even more on appearing like I\u2019m having one hell of a good time.</p><p>I pick up my wineglass and take another sip, before I smile broadly at my brother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you like working for your grandpa? How often are you going to have to go to Hartford this summer?\u201d</p><p>Pax pauses mid-bite and thinks about my question. As he does, he absently rubs my sister\u2019s back with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cAt first I wondered what the hell I\u2019d gotten myself into. There was no way I wanted to be surrounded by suits and ties every day. But then I settled in and found my place. I don\u2019t have to wear a suit and tie because I own the fucking company. I\u2019m still proving myself to my grandpa, but I think I\u2019m gonna like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to like it when you guys move away.\u201d</p><p>Mila rolls her eyes. \u201cMad, we\u2019ve been through this a hundred times. It\u2019s a two-hour plane ride. You can come see me and I\u2019ll come see you. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re never going to see each other again. And hopefully you\u2019ll be dating someone soon, so that will distract you. We\u2019ve gotta figure out something to do with your personal life.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cOh, we do, huh? You\u2019re going to have input on that?\u201d</p><p>Mila laughs and pats Pax\u2019s leg. \u201cI\u2019m good at relationships, apparently. I can help you with yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a relationship,\u201d I remind her. \u201cThat was your whole point.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019re going to start with an easy one. Ethan Eldridge. I know for a fact that he\u2019s single. I bumped into his mom at the library the other day. She said he\u2019s been lonely because a lot of his old friends have moved away. So there you go. You can start by dating Ethan. He\u2019ll be good practice.\u201d</p><p>I hold up a spoon. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter to you that this spoon has more of a personality than he does?\u201d</p><p>Pax bursts out laughing, looking over at Ethan before he glances at his wife.</p><p>\u201cShe has a point. Madison needs someone who can give her a run for her money. That guy... er, he doesn\u2019t seem quite up to it.\u201d</p><p>Mila gives her husband a skeptical look. \u201cMaybe. But Maddy has always picked guys that are too overbearing, too controlling. And then it ends in a disaster and Maddy\u2019s pissed off at the world and at the male species in general. Maybe she needs to try out a guy like Ethan.\u201d</p><p>We all glance discreetly in Ethan\u2019s direction, to find him scrolling quietly through his cell phone. He\u2019s wearing a preppy watch, a preppy shirt, perfectly fitted khakis. He\u2019s so neat and tidy that even his nails are buffed and cut to a neat square. Very neutral, very bland and vanilla.</p><p>Bland and vanilla just aren\u2019t me.</p><p>Pax turns back around, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s got it in him to handle Maddy.\u201d</p><p>I raise my eyebrows. \u201cHe can\u2019t handle me?\u201d</p><p>Pax quickly backtracks. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly what I meant. You\u2019re... shall we say... a little fierce. You need a guy with balls. You don\u2019t need a guy whose balls are in your purse. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, so says the guy whose balls are in Mila\u2019s handbag as we speak.\u201d</p><p>Mila laughs as I give Pax an icy stare. He ignores it and my comment, while he chews on a piece of bread, totally unaffected by my glare or my accusation that my sister owns his testicles. I guess he\u2019s secure enough in his manhood to not care.</p><p>Turning my head slightly, I can see Gabriel\u2019s dark shape from the corner of my eye and I almost flush again.</p><p>Throughout this entire conversation, his smoldering stare has burned holes into me. It\u2019s so potent that it almost feels like it\u2019s actually touching me. Finally I\u2019m unable to resist and I glance at him.</p><p>He stares back at me, his eyes stormy and dark.</p><p>What the hell is he thinking? Is he remembering the accident? Or is he remembering how scorchingly hot last night was before the accident? I stare at his mouth and I can\u2019t help but remember how it tasted last night before his meltdown.</p><p>Smoky, minty... like a man. I gulp.</p><p>And then I die. Because with his gaze still connected to mine, he very purposefully slips his finger into his mouth, then pulls it out slowly, sucking it.</p><p>Just like he sucked the taste of me off his fingers last night.</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>My cheeks explode into flame and his dark, dark eyes glimmer with amusement. I stare at him as I realize that he\u2019s fucking with me. He\u2019s purposely trying to remind me of last night.</p><p>The corner of his lip twitches and I know.</p><p>I know that he thinks he won whatever little game he\u2019s been playing.</p><p>Eff him. Willing the color to drain away from my face, I give Gabriel my iciest stare, lift my nose into the air and turn back around to find Mila watching the interaction.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she asks with extreme interest. I shrug.</p><p>\u201cJacey\u2019s brother. I just met him.\u201d</p><p>Mila raises her eyebrow. \u201cYou just met him?\u201d She stares at me. \u201cThat seems doubtful. You keep staring at each other. You know him. Spill.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at my sister. \u201cWhy do you have to know me so well? I met him last night at a club in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Mila chokes on her drink of water. \u201cSeriously? You met him at a club?\u201d</p><p>And without any shame at all, she spins around in her seat to stare at him.</p><p>Gabriel stares back at her with interest, then cocks an eyebrow at me. He\u2019s sprawled out in his seat, his long legs casually relaxed. None of this is affecting him in the same way it is affecting me. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t care that what happened last night was disconcerting as hell. That pisses me off.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d I hiss at Mila, yanking on her arm. \u201cGod. Do you have to be so obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d she says, without turning around. \u201cHow can I not look at the guy who has you all worked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not worked up,\u201d I answer between my teeth, tugging on her arm harder. \u201cDon\u2019t make me manhandle a pregnant woman because then Pax will kill me. Just turn around. God.\u201d</p><p>She finally does as I ask, but she looks at me strangely. \u201cWhat the hell, Maddy? Why are you so upset? It\u2019s just Jacey\u2019s brother, right?\u201d</p><p>There is a knowingness to her tone that makes me want to smack my sister, even if she is pregnant.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer firmly, ignoring her tone and resisting my urge to inflict bodily harm. \u201cHe\u2019s just Jacey\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case, I should go introduce myself. I mean, Jacey is our employee. It\u2019s only polite.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Mila is out of her seat and across the room before I can stop her. She moves surprisingly fast for a pregnant girl. I\u2019m left staring with my mouth open. Pax reaches over and snaps it closed.</p><p>\u201cShe got you, Mad.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cPax, I swear to God. One of these days I\u2019m going to kill her. It\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>Pax just laughs, entirely unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. If you were going to kill her, you would have done it a long time ago. But you didn\u2019t. Instead you protected her like a mama bear. So I have a hard time believing that you would ever harm a hair on her head. And now I\u2019ve gotta go take a piss. Can you behave yourself out here alone? And by that, I mean can you stay out here without killing anyone?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and follow him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying out here,\u201d I mutter when he looks back at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not coming with me,\u201d he grins. \u201cIt\u2019s big, but I can hold it myself.\u201d</p><p>It takes me half a second to realize what he meant, and what it is. I feel myself blush in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m surrounded by imbeciles.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes one more time for good measure, then stalk back to my office. I can hear my brother-in-law laughing as I go, just as I can feel Gabriel\u2019s dark gaze tracking every move I make. It\u2019s freaking unnerving and I\u2019m pissed at myself that I let him get to me like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m barely in my office for ten minutes before Jacey finds me. She barges in without knocking, as she always does, adjusting her blonde ponytail before she drops into a chair in front of my desk.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, what the hell? You and my brother are staring at each other like you\u2019re food on an all-you-can-eat buffet. What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Her large brown eyes are curious as she waits for me to answer.</p><p>I start to speak, close my mouth, then try again.</p> <p>\u201cLast night... Gabriel...\u201d</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t want to come out. I don\u2019t want to tell her that I almost hooked up with her brother. It doesn\u2019t feel right. This feels like dangerous territory. Isn\u2019t it against a code somewhere to not date your friend\u2019s brother? Especially when something strange seems to be going on with him? If she doesn\u2019t already know about it, I certainly don\u2019t want to be the one to give her the bad news.</p><p>Jacey knows me well, however, and her eyes glitter and then narrow as she looks at me.</p><p>\u201cGo on. What about last night?\u201d Brief pause, then her eyes light up. \u201cOh. My. God. Did you meet Gabe last night in Chicago? He was supposed to meet us but didn\u2019t because there was some problem with his taxi. But you disappeared too. Did you meet my brother last night, Madison? There\u2019s no way... right?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard and look away.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Jacey crows, jumping from her chair and dancing around in a weird circle, like an awkward little bird. \u201cYou hooked up with my brother!\u201d</p><p>I stare at her warily. \u201cAlmost. Is that weird?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me like I have two heads.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019ve wanted you guys to date for years. But when we were teenagers, he never wanted to come into town in the summers. He was going through a shy stage or some shit. And then he went overseas. You\u2019re perfect for each other. You just don\u2019t know it yet. The real question is why didn\u2019t you hook up last night? You never explained.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and glance at the clock. It\u2019s just shy of seven, prime dinner rush.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited. It was a late night, it was a club... and we just got a little carried away. And then we were in an accident in the taxi and it killed the mood. Since you were the one who talked me into trying to hook up with someone, the whole thing is your fault, if you think about it.\u201d</p> <p>Jacey ignores that last part as her brow furrows.</p><p>\u201cAn accident? Gabe told me this morning that there was a problem with his taxi. He didn\u2019t say anything about an accident. Was anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Some guy just ran a red light and T-boned us in the intersection. The taxi was totaled, but nobody was hurt. It totally killed the mood, though.\u201d</p><p>And so did walking a strangely incoherent man home to his apartment and leaving before he could murder me and hang my skin in his kitchen cabinet or something.</p><p>I so want to ask Jacey about Gabriel\u2019s weird behavior, but I hesitate. Her face is completely frozen now, as she looks utterly concerned about her brother. I don\u2019t want to give her even more to worry about.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she breathes. \u201cI owe Gabe an apology. I thought he was just making up an excuse for ditching me. You guys could\u2019ve been hurt.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t tell her that he actually was ditching her when we got in the accident.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so. But we weren\u2019t. Just shaken up.\u201d</p> <p>Him more than me. But again, I don\u2019t mention that part.</p><p>Jacey shakes her head and sighs. \u201cI swear to God, that man attracts dangerous situations. A normal person runs away from danger and Gabe runs straight for it. Always has. No one was surprised when he joined the Army Rangers, but I\u2019m definitely surprised that he\u2019s lived this long.\u201d</p><p>This is the perfect opportunity to get more information about Gabe. I stare at my friend, trying to decide how best to go about it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you telling me that he was a Ranger before,\u201d I tell her carefully. Jacey stares at me.</p><p>\u201cDo you listen to me at all?\u201d she demands. I flush. Truthfully, I tune her out sometimes. She tends to chatter aimlessly. A lot.</p><p>\u201cGabe\u2019s been overseas with the Rangers for the last three years,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s all he ever wanted to do. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so worried about him. He was in combat and Rangers do some scary shit. But then something happened and he resigned his commission. And he came home. So did his best friend, Brand. Now they\u2019re starting a business together, but I don\u2019t understand any of it. It\u2019s so not them. They\u2019re Rangers to the bone.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet now, subdued. I hesitate to ask, but I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and looks me in the eye. \u201cYour guess is as good as mine. He won\u2019t talk to me about it. But it fucked him up. I know he has problems sleeping and he\u2019s just not himself. Like, he gets mad easier and shit.\u201d</p><p>I must look horrified or something because Jacey rushes to continue.</p><p>\u201cNot like super mad or anything. He just gets annoyed easily now. That\u2019s not like him. But I know that he\u2019ll go back to normal eventually. Probably soon. I\u2019ve done some reading on guys who come home from combat. Apparently this stuff is normal. It will go away.\u201d</p><p>This stuff is definitely not normal. Not what I saw last night, anyway. But I don\u2019t say that. From what Jacey is saying, it\u2019s clear she has no idea what\u2019s going on with him.</p><p>It fucked him up. She did get that part right.</p><p>Something twinges in my chest, something soft, something I usually keep hidden away. It must be my heart, but it\u2019s hard to say. It\u2019s been so long since I acknowledged that part of me. But the idea of a wounded soldier who came home damaged like that gets to me.</p><p>For a second I picture Gabriel in fatigues, sweaty and dangerous in the desert. It suits him, actually. But then I picture him injured and maybe even alone and for whatever reason, I hate the thought. I swallow hard, then change the subject to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jace. That\u2019s terrible. But if that\u2019s true and he\u2019s some badass alpha guy, then there\u2019s no way he\u2019s right for me. I don\u2019t like guys who are adrenaline junkies or whatever. And I definitely don\u2019t like guys who lose their tempers easily.\u201d</p><p>She scowls. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. He doesn\u2019t lose his temper easily. He\u2019s just... more easily annoyed. I think he\u2019s just adjusting to civilian life. It\u2019s not a big deal, Mad. You should give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>I already did.</p><p>I push away the thought of Gabriel\u2019s hand between my legs last night in the taxi, while the taxi driver was right in the front seat. I sort of liked that adrenaline junkie side of him last night. I can\u2019t lie. Not to myself.</p><p>When I fail to answer, Jacey rolls her eyes. \u201cWhat the hell has happened to my old friend? The one who liked to take chances and steal gin from her parents\u2019 liquor cabinet and sneak out of her bedroom window to go to beach parties? You know, the Madison who didn\u2019t do things like leave her BFF at the club? I hope she comes back soon because I need a partner in crime again. I want the old Madison back. And when she comes back, she can date my brother.\u201d</p><p>Her words practically stab me in the heart because I feel old. I feel boring. I feel like someone I\u2019m not. And she\u2019s totally calling me on it. So I do what I always do when I\u2019m cornered. I hide behind a wall.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWhatever. That Madison isn\u2019t coming back. It\u2019s called growing up. You should try it. And shouldn\u2019t you be checking on your tables? Julie is probably going nuts without you.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares down her nose at me. \u201cFine. You can get rid of me right now, but trust me, I\u2019m gonna come back to this conversation. You\u2019re going to tell me every detail about your \u2018almost\u2019 one-night stand with my brother and we\u2019re going to discuss how you should date him.\u201d</p><p>With that, Jacey flounces out of my office. I try to turn my focus back to my never-ending paperwork, but I can\u2019t help going back to her words.</p><p>A retired Army Ranger. That makes such perfect sense.</p><p>Disciplined. Rigid. Dangerous. That all fits the description of a Ranger, at least in my limited experience. And even though I haven\u2019t seen evidence of it in his actions, I can see all of that in his eyes.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t seem very old, though. He can\u2019t be much older than me, so it must\u2019ve been something really bad that made him retire so young.</p><p>I decide that Gabriel Vincent is an enigma.</p><p>A blatantly arrogant enigma.</p><p>A scorchingly sexy, dangerous-as-hell enigma.</p><p>An enigma with a rippling six-pack and smoldering eyes.</p><p>Against my better judgment, I creep back down the hall and peek around the corner at him. Jacey\u2019s got her arms wrapped around his shoulders, laughing down at something he said. While he chuckles with her, he\u2019s relaxed and warm, much as he was with me last night before the taxi incident.</p><p>Across the table from him, his friend laughs at the two of them. Brand, I think Jacey called him. He\u2019s built like a brick wall and drop-dead sexy as hell. Blond, blue-eyed, crooked grin. He looks like a real-life Thor. Holy shit\u2014is this what Rangers look like? If so, they\u2019re definitely our country\u2019s finest.</p><p>But when I look at Brand, even as gorgeous as he is, the blood in my veins doesn\u2019t catch fire like it does when I look at Gabriel.</p><p>Gabriel fascinates the hell out of me. When he\u2019s in a room, he owns it, completely and totally. The memory of him sticking his finger in his mouth from across the room causes my eyes to flutter closed.</p><p>The stuff Jacey told me about him coming out of the Rangers early only made my curiosity worse. I want to know more about him, yet at the same time I know I should run far away from him.</p><p>Because there\u2019s one thing I know about myself. Try as I might to stay away from powerful, strong guys, guys who command a room, guys who might hurt me... I am totally and completely attracted to those guys. I\u2019m attracted to the very things that might hurt me the most.</p><p>It is glaringly obvious that Gabriel is all of those things.</p><p>And more.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Madison disappeared into a hallway an hour ago and she hasn\u2019t been back out since. She hasn\u2019t even been back out to sit with her sister, Mila, the chick who introduced herself to me. That makes me think Maddy might be hiding from me, which is a thought that makes me smile. I don\u2019t know why... sadistic, I guess. But if she\u2019s so coolly put together, the way she\u2019s acting tonight, then the thought that I rattled her is funny as hell.</p><p>I glance back over Mila\u2019s way. She\u2019s laughing and trying to force-feed her husband a strawberry. Pax, I think she told me. What the hell kind of name is that?</p><p>He\u2019s a big dude and rough-looking, but then I guess he\u2019d have to be with a name like that. It looks like he\u2019s been domesticated, but it\u2019s just as apparent that it wasn\u2019t always that way. He\u2019s got that look in his eyes. That lean and mean look that doesn\u2019t just go away.</p><p>Mila laughs again and as she glances up, her eyes meet mine for a second and I think about what she said to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maddy might seem like a bitch, but I promise you that she\u2019s not.</p><p>Why the hell would she say that? Maddy doesn\u2019t seem like a bitch to me, but then again, I think I know why she\u2019s acting so cold. I know, sort of, what happened last night. No one else here does. They must all think she\u2019s snubbing me for no reason.</p><p>The sound of Jacey\u2019s cajoling brings my attention back to the present, where my sister is practically sitting in Brand\u2019s lap as she tries to coerce him into telling her stories from combat.</p><p>Brand shoots me another desperate look over her head, so I take pity and rescue him. Brand might be an incredible hulk of muscle, but Jacey\u2019s always turned him into knots. He just thinks that no one knows that.</p> <p>\u201cJace, you know he can\u2019t talk about that. That shit\u2019s all classified. And you don\u2019t have the security clearance level to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Jacey glares at me. \u201cI don\u2019t have a security clearance at all.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cThat\u2019s my point. Give the guy a break. Besides, I\u2019m sure we should probably leave. We\u2019re taking up a table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go yet,\u201d Jace whines, picking up another bite of her cake. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you guys. A lot. And I hardly ever get to see you, even now that you\u2019ve been home for months. Don\u2019t you find that weird?\u201d She pauses, takes another bite, then turns to me. \u201cJust have one more cup of coffee,\u201d she tells me bossily. \u201cI\u2019ll even make it decaf.\u201d</p><p>She scoots off Brand\u2019s lap and darts off for the kitchen before I can even answer.</p> <p>Brand grins at me. \u201cSome things never change. Jacey\u2019s still got you wrapped around her little finger.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWhatever. She was sitting on your lap. Seriously, though. You know I feel bad for her. She always thinks our dad is going to change\u2014that he\u2019ll miraculously take an interest in her and then when he doesn\u2019t, she\u2019s devastated. She\u2019s never gonna learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re always gonna be there to take his place,\u201d Brand adds. \u201cAnd do the shit he doesn\u2019t. I know you, dude. And I respect the hell out of that. I do. I\u2019m sure Jacey does too, even if she doesn\u2019t show it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s tougher than she looks,\u201d I answer thoughtfully, watching as she stops to talk to some guy who just walked in the restaurant. \u201cShe tries not to get all gushy and shit, but I know she appreciates you too.\u201d</p><p>Brand follows my gaze to Jacey, freezing on the guy who is standing with her. Something about the guy seems off. He\u2019s wearing dirty work clothes and he\u2019s muscled and stout. Clearly he does some sort of manual labor. He\u2019s also clearly pissed.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Brand asks with sharp interest. I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, but they seem to be in a heated discussion and the guy\u2019s face turns red. Jacey shakes her head, rolls her eyes and turns to walk away.</p><p>And then the guy grabs her arm.</p><p>The second he touches her, anger flashes through me, red and hot. Like lightning, Brand and I both shove back from the table, lunging to our feet. I reach my sister in a few strides, with Brand right beside me.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to keep your hand, I suggest you let go of my sister,\u201d I say calmly. There\u2019s no need to raise my voice. I know how intimidating I am. And standing together, Brand and I are like a wall. We tower over this little punk.</p><p>He looks up at us and I can see fear in his eyes, even if he doesn\u2019t want to show it. He takes his time, but he makes a show of slowly and exaggeratedly releasing Jacey\u2019s arm, then holding his empty hand in the air.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d Brand tells him. \u201cI would suggest you not do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d the guy spits angrily. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJared, just leave,\u201d Jacey interjects. \u201cSeriously. You need to go.\u201d</p><p>Jared smiles. \u201cThis is a public place. I need some dinner. And I want you to serve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking way,\u201d Jacey tells him. \u201cGet out. Now. I\u2019m sick of your shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d I demand. \u201cWho is this guy and why is he bothering you?\u201d</p><p>But before she can answer, Madison emerges from the back hall. When she spots Jared, her eyes widen and she looks startled, then she masks it. She calmly approaches us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asks Jacey quietly.</p><p>\u201cJared won\u2019t leave,\u201d Jacey answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting ready to help him out,\u201d I tell Madison. The guy smiles.</p><p>\u201cTry it,\u201d he dares me. \u201cJust try it.\u201d</p><p>He turns to me, his slitted eyes challenging me, even though I can see the fear in them. He\u2019s cockier than he is smart and, if I\u2019m not mistaken, a little drunk too. I scoff at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worth my time. Just leave before you embarrass yourself. Or before I embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>Jared stares up at me.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d he scowls. \u201cJacey told me all about her big war-hero brother. Well, dumbass, you aren\u2019t overseas now. And you\u2019re not a hero here. So back the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the anger that flashes through me quick and hot. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Pax stand up from his table. Mila puts her hand on his arm, as if to urge him to stay put. I smile. She must realize what I already know. I\u2019ve got this. I don\u2019t need assistance.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be a hero to handle a little pussy like you,\u201d I answer him, maintaining my calm. \u201cGet the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>Jared doesn\u2019t move. So I move him.</p><p>Grabbing his elbow, I drag him toward the door. He struggles against me, but even though he\u2019s strong, he\u2019s much smaller than I am.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call the police,\u201d Madison tells him as she tags along at my heels. \u201cJust go, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both whores,\u201d he spits at her, struggling in my grip to turn and look at her. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to you. You need to mind your own fucking business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacey is my business,\u201d Madison answers coolly, stepping around us to open the door for me. \u201cStop harassing her. We\u2019re calling the police this time.\u201d</p><p>This time? I glare over my shoulder at Jacey, who has the good grace to look sheepish. This is the first I\u2019ve heard of someone harassing her.</p><p>Spinning, I slam the punk against the doorjamb. Behind me I hear Madison suck in her breath, but I ignore it. This asshole\u2019s back makes a satisfying thunk against the wood and I dig my fingers into his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cCall my sister a whore again, and you won\u2019t have any teeth left,\u201d I warn him. \u201cGot it?\u201d He squirms and I release him, shoving him hard toward the parking lot. \u201cGet the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>He spits on the ground, then starts to walk away. \u201cGood thing you had your buddies to help you,\u201d he calls back to me. \u201cNext time you won\u2019t be so lucky.\u201d</p><p>He gets into his car and I glance over my shoulder. Both Brand and Madison\u2019s brother-in-law are standing behind me, as if I need backup for this pathetic piece of shit. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me. I won\u2019t need help. And there better not be a next time.\u201d</p><p>The guy flips me off and spins out, squealing his tires as he tears out of the parking lot. I turn around to find Madison facing me, her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWas that really necessary?\u201d she asks. \u201cI was going to call the cops. Violence really wasn\u2019t appropriate. I have customers here.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in shock. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be happy that I removed him from your dining room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought wrong. I had the situation under control.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m astounded now. \u201cOh, really? And how exactly were you controlling it? By threatening to call the police? Assholes like that don\u2019t listen to reason, Madison. You have to speak in the language that they understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fluent in asshole-speak.\u201d Madison stares at me icily for a moment longer, then spins around and stalks off.</p><p>I don\u2019t give myself enough time to ponder the fact that the kitten has claws before I whirl around, pinning Jacey with my glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was this?\u201d</p><p>Jacey shrugs. Over her shoulder I see Madison walking her brother-in-law back to his table, then turning her head to talk with her sister. But instead of thinking about what they might be saying, I return my focus to my current problem.</p><p>Jacey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an ex-boyfriend who can\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d she answers. \u201cHe\u2019s just an asshole who takes rejection very personally. Not that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sort of is,\u201d Madison says from behind me. I glance at her, surprised that she came back after her little show of theatrics. She looks at me, her pretty face drawn. \u201cHis behavior could be a big deal, I mean. He practically attacked my little sister last year. And he\u2019s been bothering Jacey for a while. At least a month. I keep telling her to call the police but she won\u2019t. I figured I should tell you that. Maybe you can get her to see reason.\u201d</p><p>She ruined her dramatic exit to come back and tell me something to help Jacey? Interesting.</p><p>\u201cMadison, God.\u201d Jacey snaps. \u201cI don\u2019t need the police involved in this. It\u2019s embarrassing. Jared is an asshole and he\u2019s annoying, but he\u2019s not really going to do anything. Most of the time he just texts me... sends me pictures of his naked junk and shit.\u201d</p><p>Madison stares at her. \u201cJacey, he\u2019s already doing something. Not only is he still harassing you, but he\u2019s here in my place of business creating a scene.\u201d She lowers her voice now and dips her head closer to Jacey, as if what she\u2019s getting ready to say is for Jacey\u2019s ears only. But I can still hear it.</p><p>\u201cJace, my dad had that kind of temper. It doesn\u2019t get better. Those kind of guys are bullies who will intimidate you until you push back, until you make him see that he can\u2019t treat you like that. That you won\u2019t let him treat you like that. You have to step up and do something.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still now as I watch her. She doesn\u2019t know it, but she just showed me something about herself, something that makes her vulnerable. Someone.</p><p>But I can\u2019t think about that right now. Right now I have to deal with my sister.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk,\u201d I tell Jacey, taking her by the elbow and guiding her back to the table. \u201cWhat exactly happened when you broke up with that guy?\u201d</p><p>Jacey shakes her head. \u201cNothing out of the ordinary. I told him that it wasn\u2019t working and he didn\u2019t like it. He texts me nonstop, drives by the cottage, calls and hangs up... it\u2019s frustrating, but he\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Brand stares at her. \u201cLittle hotheads like him sometimes don\u2019t just \u2018get over\u2019 something. He\u2019s clearly got a problem. I\u2019m going to need his name and address.\u201d</p><p>I glance at my friend. After serving in the Rangers with him, I know exactly what he\u2019s capable of.</p><p>\u201cStand down, soldier,\u201d I mutter to him. \u201cThis is civilian life. We aren\u2019t going to pay the asshole a visit. Not yet, anyway.\u201d I turn to my sister. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here alone. When is Gran coming back from Florida?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our grandparents have owned a cottage here in Angel Bay since before I was born. We stayed here with them every summer when we were kids, but then our grandfather died and our gran hasn\u2019t been the same. Jacey still spends summers here to keep Gran company, but for at least the past year, Gran has been in Florida most of the time anyway.</p><p>Jacey cringes. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe this but I don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back. I think she met someone in her retirement village.\u201d She watches my face and nods. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t like to think about it either. But you know, Grandpa\u2019s been gone for years now. I suppose she\u2019s lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Brand mutters, swigging his beer. \u201cGeriatric sex. I\u2019m out. Where\u2019s the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Jacey points him in the right direction and then she drops into his vacant seat. I stare at her, waiting for her to give me an explanation. After a couple of minutes of silence, I just flat out ask.</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about that guy?\u201d I ask her, serious now. \u201cYou should have.\u201d</p><p>She drops her eyes and stares at the empty beer bottle that Brand left behind.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can handle it on my own,\u201d she tells me with a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have my big brother swoop in and save me.\u201d</p><p>I sigh too. \u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d I reply. \u201cBut maybe your big brother wants to swoop in and save you. It\u2019s sort of what I do.\u201d</p><p>She laughs at that. \u201cOh, great. So you retire from the army and I\u2019m going to have to let you save me all the time so that you get your hero fix?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d I answer absently. In my head I\u2019m thinking about my schedule. \u201cI think I can stay here for a while,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBrand and I have to pitch our new body armor to the Pentagon in a couple of months, but until then I\u2019m free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I find another investor in the meantime,\u201d Brand interjects as he grabs another chair and comes back to the table. \u201cBut even then, you can get to the meeting just as easily from here as you could from your condo.\u201d</p><p>I nod and Jacey stares at us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand your new business,\u201d she admits. \u201cYou\u2019re selling body armor to the government, right? Why don\u2019t they make their own body armor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d Brand explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good enough because the good stuff has always been too expensive. Gabe and I want to design better armor that the government can buy for every soldier. If we can do it, and if we can get the army to buy it, then no one will ever have to go through what we went through.\u201d</p><p>Jacey grumbles, \u201cAnd I have no idea what you went through because you won\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p> <p>Brand and I both are silent and Jacey sighs. \u201cI know, I know. You\u2019ll talk to me about it when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, Jacey. It\u2019s just not something we like to talk about to anyone,\u201d Brand offers. \u201cThink about the most horrible thing you could possibly think of. The bloodiest, scariest thing... your worst nightmare. Then picture it happening to you... picture it becoming your reality, a nightmare that you can\u2019t wake up from. Trust me, you wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it either.\u201d</p><p>Jacey looks stricken and she puts a hand on my arm as she stares at us both.</p><p>\u201cFine. I get it. But seriously, if either one of you ever want to talk about it, I\u2019m here. And I have two ears to listen with.\u201d</p><p>I pat her hand. \u201cThanks, Jace. But back to the matter at hand. I\u2019m going to stay with you for a while. No arguments.\u201d</p><p>Jacey groans, but finally nods. \u201cFine. I guess it would be nice to have you around anyway. I miss you. And you know, Gran\u2019s been after you to come and bug-bomb her basement for spiders ever since you got home. This will give you an opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She grins and it\u2019s my turn to groan. \u201cCrap. I forgot. I don\u2019t know much about bug-bombing, but between Brand and me, we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Brand yelps. \u201cHow the hell did I figure into this? The only thing I know about spiders is that I stay away from them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you in beer,\u201d I offer.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d he quickly agrees.</p><p>I turn back to Jacey. \u201cNow, about this Jared guy. What\u2019s he like? I want to get a handle on him.\u201d</p><p>Jacey thinks on that. \u201cWell, he isn\u2019t the most stable person. I should\u2019ve listened to Maddy. She tried to tell me what he did with Mila. But when I asked him about it, he said he\u2019d been drunk and wasn\u2019t himself and I believed him. The problem is, he\u2019s drunk all the time and so he gets ugly. But if you\u2019re at the house, I bet he\u2019ll leave me alone. No one in their right mind, drunk or not, would mess with you. Your bicep is as big as my thigh.\u201d</p><p>I picture Mila, the sister who introduced herself to me earlier. The sweet, charming sister who clearly wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. If that asshole would fuck with a chick like that, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to fuck with my feisty sister.</p><p>\u201cYou have to take unbalanced little fucks like him seriously, Jace. And somehow, I doubt your little boy toy is intimidating enough to help much. But I\u2019ll be here now and hopefully Jared will just stay away and the problem will be taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d Jacey sighs. \u201cBut don\u2019t rag on Peter. He\u2019s in a band. He doesn\u2019t need to be intimidating. He\u2019s a creative.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and she grins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get my side work done so that Maddy doesn\u2019t freak out. She pretty much stays until the last person is ready to go. When will you be at the cottage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive home and pack a bag and then be back tonight. It might be late, but I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019K.\u201d She drops a kiss on my forehead as she walks past. \u201cYou\u2019re the best big brother I have. Thank you for my birthday watch. It\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d She stares at her wrist, at the glittering gold watch I brought her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the only big brother you have,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>She starts to walk away, then stops, glancing back at me. \u201cHey, Ethan Eldridge is asking Maddy out. You\u2019d better get over there and take care of that.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up, only for me to find Madison talking to the candy-ass she was with earlier. I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying, but Jacey can.</p><p>\u201cYou missed out.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cShe just said yes.\u201d</p><p>Why does that annoy me so much? Maddy looks up and catches my gaze, her cheeks flushing. Why do I bother her so much? What the hell did I do last night?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own her, Jace,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cShe can date whoever she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want her to date you,\u201d Jacey says. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know how perfect you are for each other.\u201d I just roll my eyes and turn back to Brand.</p><p>We watch Jacey walk off and then Brand looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to fuck him up, right?\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s not talking about the candy-ass who just asked Madison out. He\u2019s talking about the little asshole giving my sister a hard time. I stare at Brand levelly over the rim of my beer bottle.</p><p>\u201cYep. If he comes anywhere near her.\u201d</p><p>Brand nods in satisfaction. \u201cFucking prick. Jacey\u2019s gotta stop dating those losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I agree. \u201cShe\u2019s got to stop dating so many guys, period. She needs to be more discriminating. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>Brand looks at me, his expression suddenly serious.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it might help you to be here. It\u2019s a good place for you to try and get back on your feet, to get healthy again, you know?\u201d</p><p>A knot forms in my throat and I ignore it. I nod wordlessly as I stare out the window. I don\u2019t like talking about this shit, not even with Brand.</p><p>\u201cI know what it\u2019s like,\u201d he reminds me. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got demons. You and I just happen to share ours. And dude, it\u2019s not your fault. And it\u2019s not my fault. We got served a shit sandwich that night. You\u2019ve got to stop blaming yourself for it. Mad Dog wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad Dog can\u2019t want anything,\u201d I tell him grimly. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. And if I hadn\u2019t been distracted...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Brand interrupts. \u201cNo. Just stop right there. There\u2019s no way we could\u2019ve known what was going on. Not you, and not me either. You\u2019ve got to deal with this and move on, Gabe. Trust me, I know.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a minute before I finally nod. He\u2019s got a point. It really might help me to be here. And he does know what he\u2019s talking about. When we first came back from overseas, Brand signed up for extensive PTSD therapy, while I opted out. For one thing, I think therapy\u2019s a bunch of bullshit. For another, they can\u2019t fix me like they fixed Brand. What happened wasn\u2019t his fault. It was mine.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I agree. \u201cI\u2019ll try to deal with this. How\u2019s your foot?\u201d</p><p>That night... the night that we both would like to forget, has left lasting scars on the both of us in different ways. The explosion that blew apart our Humvee broke every bone in Brand\u2019s left leg and foot, basically crushing it. The doctors had to reconstruct the entire thing and now it\u2019s more steel and screws than it is bone. Brand still walks with a barely discernible limp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d he answers. \u201cStill hurts like a bitch, but you know what they say. Pain is just weakness leaving the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy summabitch,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh,\u201d he answers, shaking his head. \u201cI passed the psych test with flying colors when we discharged. I\u2019m certifiably sane. True story.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNope. You just know how to act that way. True story.\u201d</p><p>Brand laughs and throws a twenty on the table as a tip for Jacey.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit much?\u201d I raise an eyebrow. He shrugs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her birthday. And she\u2019s always broke. That girl seriously can\u2019t manage her money. She needs to get her ass back in school so that she can get a job where she makes more of it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at the mere thought of my sister\u2019s fickle career plans.</p><p>\u201cIf she made more money, she\u2019d probably just spend that too. She\u2019s changed her mind a thousand times. But she\u2019d better figure it out soon. She can\u2019t wait tables forever.\u201d</p><p>Regardless of my harsh words, I toss a tip down too. She does need the money.</p><p>Brand hesitates before he walks away. \u201cI mean it. Take some time off.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s nowhere to be seen, so I shoot her a text, telling her that I\u2019ll see her later tonight. I take a step for the door, and then get an idea.</p><p>Taking the extra receipt lying on the table, I scribble a note and then my cell number before I fold it over and walk it to the burly guy tending bar.</p><p>\u201cCould you give this to Madison?\u201d I ask him. He stares at me curiously, but holds his hand out for the note.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answers, questioning me with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I reply, handing it to him, not offering him an answer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leave without looking back, climbing into my Camaro.</p><p>It\u2019s not a practical car, but I always wanted one, so when I discharged from the Rangers I bought one brand-new... sort of as a consolation prize for giving up my dream job. It\u2019s a badass car, but it\u2019s not nearly good enough to make up for the life I lost.</p><p>One single night changed my life forever.</p><p>One fucking night.</p> <p>And the worst part is that even though it was my fault, if we\u2019d been better protected, Mad Dog would still be alive and Brand\u2019s leg wouldn\u2019t have been destroyed.</p><p>None of that can be changed for us now. But if we can change it for future soldiers, we\u2019ll try like hell to make it happen. All we have to do now is finish designing the product, get another investor so that we can have prototypes made and then successfully pitch it to the Pentagon.</p><p>Easy.</p><p>I light up a cigarette as I blow down the quiet highway. Everything here in Angel Bay is quiet and uneventful; barely anything happens. This really might be what I need to get my shit straight.</p><p>And it doesn\u2019t hurt anything that this is where Madison is.</p> <p>I grin at the sheer fucking coincidence of it all.</p><p>And then I grin again at the note that I left for her.</p><p>We need to finish what we started.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Madison</p><p>I grit my teeth as I think about those words, color flooding my cheeks as I let Gabriel get to me once again.</p> <p>We need to finish what we started.</p><p>Who the hell does he think he is? Oh my God. He\u2019s so fucking arrogant. He thinks he can completely ignore the fact that he turned into a crazy person the other night, offer me no explanation whatsoever, stroll into my restaurant and just find me waiting to fuck him?</p><p>He\u2019s crazier than I thought he was.</p><p>I look into the mirror as I put in my earrings, the diamond studs that I wear when I want to dress up. They were the last gift that my parents gave me before they died, a college graduation present.</p><p>I study myself now. My hair is pulled into a loose chignon at the nape of my neck, I\u2019m wearing lipstick, a little black dress, and kick-ass black strappy heels. I\u2019m the perfect picture of a date.</p><p>And hell no. I\u2019m not going out with Gabriel. He thinks he can come in and shove someone around in my restaurant and I\u2019ll just fall at his feet in gratitude? He\u2019s crazy. The Hill already had one bully, and he\u2019s been dead for four years. We don\u2019t need another one.</p><p>The memory of Gabriel\u2019s face as he slammed Jared against the door causes my stomach to clench. He almost seemed to like it. He liked having Jared at his mercy. I squeeze my eyes closed, then open them again, refocusing.</p><p>No more thinking about Gabriel.</p> <p>Ethan is making me dinner tonight and damn it, I\u2019m going to like it. Or at least I\u2019m going to pretend like hell that I do. I sigh and pick up my black clutch, turning the lights off and heading out to my car.</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>Other people\u2019s perceptions don\u2019t usually bother me at all, but for some reason I really hate the idea that everyone thinks I don\u2019t have a social life. I don\u2019t have a social life because I haven\u2019t met anyone who makes me want one.</p><p>It only takes ten minutes to drive across our little town and Ethan meets me as I walk up to his door. He\u2019s wearing a light-blue V-neck sweater that complements his eyes and slim black pants that complement his ass. I should be attracted to him.</p><p>So why aren\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d thought you\u2019d be right on the lake,\u201d I tell him as he greets me. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019d live in one of these new condos.\u201d</p><p>He smiles and takes my sweater.</p><p>\u201cI know. But my schedule\u2019s too crazy to take care of a cottage. I\u2019m pretty much a slave to the hospital.\u201c</p><p>I stare at him, marveling once again that people put their health (and their very fragile babies) into his large and clumsy hands. I can\u2019t help but tell him that very thing.</p><p>He laughs good-naturedly. \u201cOh, Maddy. You\u2019ve got to get to know me again. I think you\u2019re gonna be pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p><p>As we walk into his condo, I have to admit that I am pleasantly surprised by it. Everything is so sleek and modern; and everything is neat and clean. It\u2019s not what I was expecting, based on the guy Ethan used to be. As hard as it is for me to imagine it, maybe he really has grown up.</p><p>\u201cThis is gorgeous,\u201d I tell him as I turn around, taking it all in. \u201cA very grown-up condo.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cIt suits the grown-up man who lives in it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cTouch\u00e9. All right. I admit it. I\u2019m going to have to try and see you in a different light, not like the boy who ate a grasshopper.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cSeriously. Am I never going to live that down? I was ten years old! A lot changes in fifteen years, Madison.\u201d</p><p>We laugh and he sits me down on a sleek sofa while he pours me a glass of wine. \u201cI hope you like red,\u201d he says as he hands it to me. \u201cWe\u2019re having veal so I paired it with a nice merlot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d I tell him as our fingers touch. \u201cAnd very grown-up. I love merlot.\u201d</p><p>He grins, then excuses himself to go check on the food. The delicious smells coming from the kitchen make my mouth water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a surprise to find out that you can cook too,\u201d I call across the room. The condo is an open design, so I can see everything he\u2019s doing. He chuckles as he closes up the oven and then comes around the kitchen bar top with the bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with my hands,\u201d he tells me suggestively as he sits next to me. \u201cTrust me.\u201d I have to smile.</p><p>\u201cOK. You really have changed. You weren\u2019t this flirty in high school.\u201d</p><p>Ethan stares at me, surprised. \u201cI was too! Just not with you. You scared the shit out of me. I wanted to ask you out for four years straight, but I was afraid you\u2019d crush me if I ever did. You were out of my league.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m the surprised one now. \u201cOut of your league? You know that everyone called you Ken, right? As in Ken doll... because you were so perfect?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s interested now, staring at me intently. \u201cTell me more about this,\u201d he grins.</p><p>I laugh and we chat and suddenly everything feels like old times again, just like when he used to come to my house with groups of our friends and hang out for bonfires on the beach.</p><p>The problem is, it feels just like old times. I don\u2019t feel any chemistry with him now, just like I didn\u2019t back then.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you do for fun, Ethan?\u201d I ask politely, sipping at my wine. He mimics the motion, sipping his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have time for much,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy time is pretty much all taken up by the hospital. If I\u2019m home, then I\u2019m sleeping or watching TV for a minute. I have very little free time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re spending an evening with me,\u201d I point out. Ethan grins.</p><p>\u201cSee? You should feel flattered.\u201d</p><p>I practically sigh aloud as I ignore the way he keeps edging closer to me. It\u2019s apparent that he\u2019s not having the lack-of-chemistry problem that I\u2019m having.</p><p>To make matters worse, he\u2019s probably used to women at the clinic throwing themselves at him for the simple reason that he\u2019s a good-looking doctor. He\u2019s not used to rejection because those nurses and nurse\u2019s aides and patients... they don\u2019t care that he\u2019s boring as hell and just lives to work. All they see is the \u201cMD\u201d on his name tag.</p><p>They don\u2019t care that he lacks a spark. They don\u2019t care that he\u2019d never slide his hand between their legs in a taxi. They don\u2019t care that he would never fuck their mouths with his tongue while the cab driver sneaks glances in the rearview mirror. My cheeks explode into flame.</p><p>Fuck. Why am I thinking about Gabriel again?</p><p>And worse, why do thoughts of him turn me on so freaking much?</p><p>I\u2019m almost relieved when dinner is finally ready, when I can step away from Ethan, when I can stop pretending to be interested in what he\u2019s saying. When I can stop pretending that I\u2019m not thinking about someone else.</p><p>Instead I can distract myself by eating. I\u2019ve never been so happy to see a plate of steaming veal Marsala in my life.</p><p>\u201cThis is really good,\u201d I tell him as I take another bite. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cGood. That was my goal. I really can\u2019t make anything else.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. I can. I just wanted you to laugh. You\u2019re too serious, Mad. You might look like her, but you\u2019re not the girl I remember from school.\u201d</p><p>I feel my cheeks flush with color as I reach for my wineglass. How many times have I heard that very thing since my parents died? What the hell do people expect? Mila and I were orphaned, for God\u2019s sake. We had to grow up in a hurry and that meant getting serious. I had to watch out for my sister, take over the restaurant, assume the business loan... none of those things were easy.</p><p>I don\u2019t say any of that, though, because none of it is Ethan\u2019s fault... or his business.</p><p>\u201cWell, things changed after my parents died,\u201d I simply say.</p><p>He nods thoughtfully. \u201cI figured that was it. My mom said that you pretty much shouldered everything yourself. You let Mila do her own thing while you came home and took over the restaurant. That was nice of you.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that big of a deal,\u201d I protest. \u201cI majored in business so that when I got too old to model, I\u2019d have a fallback plan. So it made sense that I should take over the Hill. Neither of us wanted to sell it and Mila would have taken it over if I\u2019d asked her to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t ask her,\u201d Ethan pointed out. \u201cYou came home to run it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cI did. Mila never wanted anything to do with business. She\u2019s always been artsy. That was always her dream. And her dreams shouldn\u2019t die just because our parents did.\u201d</p><p>Ethan stares at me and then pours me another glass of wine. \u201cI was at school when I heard about your parents, Maddy. I didn\u2019t really know what to do. But I am really sorry about what happened to them. And about what\u2019s happened to you because of it. I understand that you don\u2019t want Mila to give up her dreams... and I respect that. But what about your own? Running the Hill wasn\u2019t your dream. It was theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d I admit grudgingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Ethan? Are you trying to make me think I should be unsatisfied?\u201d I smile, to try to lighten the tone, but I still ask the question. Because seriously\u2014what the hell?</p><p>Ethan immediately shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. You just don\u2019t seem as happy as you used to be. And I\u2019m just trying to figure out why. I didn\u2019t mean to offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, things change and I\u2019m not the girl you remember,\u201d I point out. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t offend me.\u201d</p><p>But he kind of did.</p><p>I sip at the rest of my wine and we chat for a bit more over dessert, about old times. About high school and college, and old friends that we have in common. And then out of the blue, Ethan looks at me seriously. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know this is probably a stupid question since you\u2019re here tonight, but are you dating anyone? I mean, seriously seeing someone?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taken aback by his question and stare at him stupidly for a second.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I finally manage to say. \u201cIf I was, I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t be too happy about the fact that I\u2019m here on a date with you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grins and seems relieved. \u201cOK. Good. I just wasn\u2019t sure if you were considering this a date or not, or if you just thought we were catching up. I just wanted to check.\u201d</p> <p>I have to laugh. \u201cI actually thought we were just catching up, but Mila insisted it was a date. So I\u2019m glad that\u2019s cleared up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you look beautiful and I\u2019m not ready to say good night,\u201d Ethan announces. \u201cWant to go for a walk on the beach? It\u2019s not raining for the first time in days. We should take advantage of it. I can drive us there and you can leave your heels in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBecause there\u2019s no way in hell these heels are getting anywhere near the sand. I had to eat frozen burritos for a month for these.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, not knowing that I eat frozen burritos anyway. As he helps me shrug into my sweater, he dips his head and inhales. \u201cYou smell fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I murmur. The compliment was nice, but I\u2019m rethinking my decision to extend our date.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me because I\u2019m still not attracted to him, even though he\u2019s Mr. Perfect now.</p><p>I climb into his BMW and he closes my door, a perfect gentleman. We\u2019re at the beach in just a couple of minutes.</p><p>As Ethan pulls into a space, I gaze out across the water.</p><p>\u201cIt seems so majestic, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I ask Ethan softly. \u201cSo big. It makes me feel so small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he replies as he opens my door. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely windy.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at his lack of appreciation for the beauty around us and follow him down the narrow path to the shore. Wild grass blows on either side of the hard-packed trail. To our left the water crashes into the shore. To our right the sand dunes roll, rugged and beautiful.</p> <p>\u201cI love it here,\u201d I sigh and I grasp Ethan\u2019s arm.</p><p>I mean, it\u2019s supposed to be a date. I can touch the guy, right? The wind is chilly and his arm is warm. It\u2019s not a crime to absorb some of his heat.</p><p>I don\u2019t even let my mind wander to the guy I\u2019d really like to be touching. And I wouldn\u2019t just be touching him to stay warm, either. The mere thought of how I\u2019d like to touch him makes my cheeks flush yet again as in my head, Gabriel winks at me.</p><p>Why the hell is he stuck in my head?</p><p>\u201cI like it here too,\u201d Ethan answers, bringing me back to my present company. \u201cI thought about staying in the city to do my residency but I really just wanted to come home. It was a nice surprise to find you still here. You always seemed destined for something bigger than here, you know?\u201d</p><p>He smiles down at me with white teeth a supermodel would be envious of. I really, really, really wish that my heart would flutter or my hormones would react. But they don\u2019t. Nothing. Nada.</p><p>Hell. I\u2019m such a dating failure.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was definitely hard getting used to being back here. It\u2019s so small.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan laughs at that, but thankfully lets the conversation thread go. I\u2019m grateful because his small talk is annoyingly bland.</p><p>We continue walking and chatting and I continue holding on to his arm.</p><p>He appears to be genuinely interested in all the things I tell him about the Hill, although I can\u2019t say the same for myself about his tales from the clinic. How can someone so gorgeous be so freaking boring?</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah, I was freaked out when I first gave someone a catheter. I mean, seriously. Who really wants to pick up another man\u2019s penis and insert a hose into it? Thank God that\u2019s usually the nurses\u2019 job.\u201d Ethan continues to tell me his medical tales and I continue to tune them out. Because seriously. I don\u2019t want to hear about him playing with another man\u2019s junk.</p><p>As I concentrate on not listening, a figure takes shape in the near distance, jogging toward us. Out of idle curiosity, I keep an eye on the jogger as he draws closer and closer, and then almost gasp when I finally realize who it is.</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>No freaking way. It\u2019s like the universe is determined to keep bringing me into his path.</p><p>My mouth instantly goes dry as his stormy eyes lock on my face.</p><p>We need to finish what we started.</p><p>I feel my cheeks flush and as they do, he smirks... like he knows exactly what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>He\u2019s shirtless and the muscles in his chest and abdomen flex with every movement. His dark hair is mussed and damp, so it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s been running for a while.</p><p>Sweet Mary. Why is it that an entire evening with Ethan leaves me cold but one freaking glance from this guy sets my blood on fire?</p><p>The man is built. His arms are cut, his abs are a rock-hard washboard and he\u2019s got that perfect V running down into the waistband of his shorts. I try to pretend that I don\u2019t notice, but I can tell from his smirk that he knows that I did.</p><p>I ignore it. Instead I ponder the way he seems so lean and efficient. Every movement is smooth and deliberate. And powerful. I\u2019ve always heard that Special Forces turn their soldiers into trained killers. I don\u2019t know about that, but holy crap, he looks lethal.</p><p>I can\u2019t seem to look away and as he jogs past, he glances at me sideways.</p><p>He also splashes through a tiny pool of water, which splatters Ethan\u2019s pants in muddy droplets.</p><p>\u201cHey, dude,\u201d Ethan protests, turning to glare after Gabriel. \u201cWatch what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m surprised that Ethan would say anything at all because it was clearly an accident, but I\u2019m equally surprised when Gabriel stops, turns and walks back to us, sweat glistening on his brow. Hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asks incredulously. Apparently he\u2019s surprised too.</p><p>Ethan seems hesitant now that he\u2019s face-to-face with Gabe.</p><p>\u201cI said watch it,\u201d he says, quieter now. \u201cYou got mud on my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I now?\u201d Gabe rolls his eyes. \u201cI apologize. I apologize that you\u2019re a candy-ass who doesn\u2019t like to get dirty.\u201d</p><p>Ethan practically sputters as he steps toward Gabriel and I have no clue what to do.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha gonna do, candy-ass?\u201d Gabriel taunts him, leaning forward mockingly. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel raises an eyebrow, waiting, and I shake my head, disappointed that he would react like this. Disappointed, but not surprised. He did punch a hole in his wall, for God\u2019s sake, then turned around and slammed Jared into a wall. It\u2019s clear what kind of guy he is... someone who has a temper problem. Before I can stop myself, I speak up for Ethan.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Gabriel? You splashed mud on him. This is your fault, not his. Why are you being such a dick about it?\u201d</p><p>The way he looks at me, with almost an offended expression, makes me wonder... is this overreaction about me? Is he annoyed that Ethan is here with me? His face closes up, though, and I decide that that can\u2019t be right</p><p>\u201cCome find me if you get tired of having a girl fight your battles,\u201d Gabriel tells Ethan. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be happy to buy you another pair of candy-ass pants.\u201d</p><p>He starts to walk away, then turns back around, his eyes locking on mine. His dark gaze is intense as he stares into my eyes, then at my mouth.</p><p>What\u2019s he thinking? Why the hell is he acting like what happened the other night was normal? Like any of this is normal?</p><p>It\u2019s not normal.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t he care that I helped him? I took a chance, a risk, by walking a strange man home because I just couldn\u2019t leave him there alone. And now he just wants to pretend that none of it happened.</p><p>He just keeps staring at my lips with a gaze that says, It doesn\u2019t matter. None of that matters, Maddy.</p><p>And for a minute it really doesn\u2019t because he\u2019s staring at my mouth like he wants to devour it and that\u2019s all I can think about.</p><p>Self-consciously, I drag my teeth across my bottom lip. In reaction, the corner of his tilts up and I get a glimpse of his white teeth, his pink tongue.</p><p>The same tongue that has licked and sucked my nipples.</p><p>My heart slams in my chest and he smiles, just slightly.</p><p>He knows what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>I take a breath. He takes a step.</p><p>He takes another one, dipping his head toward my ear, close enough that Ethan can\u2019t hear, close enough that his lips graze my cheek.</p><p>\u201cThink about me, Maddy.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops. Before I can respond, he grins cockily and spins around, jogging past us without looking back.</p><p>\u201cWhat a dick,\u201d Ethan mutters. \u201cWho is that guy? What did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacey\u2019s brother,\u201d I answer, fighting an incredible urge to look over my shoulder, to watch him jog away. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s still here. I think he lives in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>I know he lives in Chicago. But obviously I don\u2019t mention that or how I know that. And I definitely don\u2019t tell him what Gabriel said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we can hope that he goes home soon,\u201d Ethan grumbles. \u201cWe don\u2019t need assholes like that here. This town is too small for that. It\u2019s bad enough that we have Pax Tate.\u201d</p><p>His head snaps up as he remembers that Pax is my brother-in-law, as he realizes that he just stuck his foot in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it like that. It\u2019s just that ever since he moved here a few years ago, we all knew to steer clear of him. We knew that if we bumped into him on a bad day, he would be a total asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d I demand. \u201cYou were hardly ever home to bump into him. And he\u2019s not an asshole anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say,\u201d Ethan says, seemingly unconvinced. His tone, his words... everything about him right now is annoying me. He has no right to judge Pax. Not by a long shot.</p><p>And yes, Gabriel overreacted. He could\u2019ve kept on jogging and pretended that he didn\u2019t hear Ethan. But Ethan didn\u2019t need to say anything in the first place. So what if he got some water splashed on his pants?</p><p>He really is a candy-ass.</p><p>And Gabe so clearly is not.</p><p>My mood toward Ethan has definitely been dampened even more than it already was and I remain quiet as he and I walk back to his car.</p><p>After he drives me back to his place, I tell him that I\u2019m tired and that I should really head home rather than come inside for a drink. I can tell he\u2019s disappointed, but he handles it smoothly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, Maddy. I\u2019ve been up since four a.m., so I\u2019m wiped too. But this was fun. We should do it again soon.\u201d</p><p>There is an awkward pause as I stand next to my car.</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s contemplating kissing me and I dread the thought.</p><p>Don\u2019t, I silently instruct him. But instead of expecting him to read my mind, I solve the problem by raising myself up on my tiptoes and kissing his cheek.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I murmur.</p><p>Ethan stares down at me as the top of my car lowers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you this week, OK?\u201d</p><p>I nod and get into my car, and as I drive away, I mentally examine myself.</p><p>I hate candy-ass guys but I also hate bullies. My father was a bully. I didn\u2019t like it then and I don\u2019t like it now.</p><p>Even bullies who are sexy as hell. Especially bullies who are sexy as hell, because they just draw me in toward something that I need to stay far away from. Because Mila was right the other night\u2014I do tend to pick the wrong guys. I tend to be attracted to the wrong guys.</p> <p>Honestly, I\u2019m starting to think that there is no one out there for me. I don\u2019t like the guys I should, and the guys I like are bad for me. Maybe I\u2019m destined to be alone.</p><p>When I walk into my empty house, it only emphasizes that fact.</p><p>I\u2019m alone.</p><p>I kick off my shoes, drop my purse on a table in the foyer and collapse into a chair in the living room with a bottle of wine.</p><p>Just the bottle, no glass.</p> <p>I dangle my legs over the side of the chair as I think about the evening.</p><p>Thoughts of Ethan make me cringe. Besides annoying me with his judgment of Pax, Ethan just lacks something. A spark, a passion. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but whatever it is, I doubt he\u2019s ever going to make me feel the way I want someone to make me feel.</p><p>But Gabriel does.</p><p>One smoldering look from him sends my pulse racing, bully or not.</p><p>We need to finish what we started.</p><p>Fuck. What is wrong with me? Why am I so stuck on someone I shouldn\u2019t want... but do?</p> <p>All I know is Gabriel has that certain kind of confidence. The kind that turns my stomach inside out. And there\u2019s something else about him, too... something intriguing. I don\u2019t even know him, but there\u2019s something in his eyes, something dark and haunted that draws me to him.</p><p>I ponder that for a minute; ponder what he might have seen in Afghanistan that was so terrible that it scarred him inside. What turned him into a panicky mess the night of the taxi accident?</p><p>Because he doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of guy who panics.</p><p>In my head I see him jogging on the beach again, all huge and strong and disciplined. Judging by how sweaty he was, I bet he\u2019d been jogging for miles and yet he was still going, just like a machine. He\u2019s clearly a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Yet something has the power to bring him to his knees. It\u2019s a puzzle.</p><p>My eyes flutter closed as I picture Gabriel\u2019s rippling muscles, glistening with a light sheen of sweat. I picture him crawling up and over me, rubbing against me, his fingers stroking me.</p><p>Oh my God. My eyes snap open and my cheeks flush as I realize I just drifted into a fantasy about Gabriel. He\u2019s a guy that is made of everything that scares me.</p><p>He will hurt you.</p> <p>I know that.</p><p>Yet at the same time, I know he\u2019s a guy who can turn me on in one second flat.</p><p>What the eff is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cMadison, there is something wrong with you,\u201d Jacey sighs, shaking her head as she sifts through a rack of spring blouses. \u201cSeriously. I know some girls who would give their left ovary to date Ethan Eldridge and you\u2019re standing here complaining that he doesn\u2019t do it for you? Let\u2019s recap, shall we? He\u2019s gorgeous, he\u2019s a doctor, and did I mention that he\u2019s a gorgeous freaking doctor?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as I pull out a pink tunic and examine it. It would look perfect with my gray skinny jeans so I drape it over my arm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a resident doctor and he is good-looking. But I\u2019ve just known him too long. I want the butterflies... that fluttery feeling that you get when you meet someone amazing. And besides, why are you on Team Ethan so hard right now? I thought you wanted me to date your brother.\u201d</p><p>I stare pointedly at her and she doesn\u2019t even have the grace to look sheepish.</p><p>She simply stares back at me. \u201cBecause he was sort of rude yesterday, not exactly a great first impression. I just figured you wouldn\u2019t want to give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>Actually, Gabe made one hell of a first impression.</p><p>I smile as I think of him outside the club that night. He was so cocky and sexy in the alley behind the club, grabbing my wrist and pulling me to him. My heart speeds up just thinking about it. I shouldn\u2019t like that shit... that alpha, ultra-confident bad-boy shit. But I do. I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t make a bad first impression,\u201d I tell Jacey. \u201cIt was the second impression that sucked.\u201d</p><p>Jacey crows when she sees the expression on my face.</p><p>\u201cI knew it! I knew you liked him. Maddy, I promise you, he\u2019s perfect for you. Just give him another chance. Puh-leeeease! It will be easy for you too. He\u2019s going to stay here with me for a while because of Jared. Big Brother Gabriel is going to fight my battles for me.\u201d</p><p>Jacey hands me a blue peasant blouse to try on. \u201cHe\u2019ll be with me for at least a couple of weeks. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be into the Hill a lot to eat. He doesn\u2019t really cook.\u201d</p><p>I look up at her. \u201cYou know we have a delivery service. He won\u2019t even have to come in. We can deliver meals right to his door.\u201d</p><p>Jacey laughs. \u201cWhatever. You know you want to see him. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>Heaven help me, I do. But I\u2019d never admit it to her. To admit my infatuation to her would make it real. And I can\u2019t make it real or act on it because it\u2019s not good for me. At all.</p><p>So instead I just shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see him. And he\u2019s not into me anyway, so it\u2019s all a moot point.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a lie, but I figure it might shut Jacey down.</p><p>But no.</p><p>Jacey glances up at me, even more interested now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019s into you?\u201d Her eyes gleam. \u201cBecause I can find out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I groan. \u201cWe\u2019re not in fourth grade. Leave it alone, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Jacey mutters. \u201cBut if you change your mind, I\u2019ll give you his number and you can call him yourself.\u201d</p><p>I can tell that she\u2019s not sure whether I\u2019m telling the truth or not about not wanting to see her brother. And to be honest, I\u2019m not sure either.</p><p>Because even though I know I shouldn\u2019t, I find myself thinking about him all the time. I think about his husky voice in my ear and his hand between my legs in that taxi. I think about his dark, dark gaze and how it sets my skin on fire from across the room.</p><p>But even more telling than my runaway thoughts is one interesting thing.</p><p>I haven\u2019t thrown his number away. It\u2019s neatly folded and tucked inside my purse, along with the accompanying message.</p><p>We need to finish what we started.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>The night is so fucking black that I can\u2019t even see my hand in front of my face. I groan, try to move, then give up. I try to hear, try to see, try to move the rest of my body... but fail on all counts. The shadows move around me and I\u2019m too weak to care. I don\u2019t feel anything and I think that\u2019s odd. I should be in fucking pain and for a second I\u2019m panicked that I\u2019m paralyzed.</p><p>I calm down when I realize I\u2019m probably just in shock. I groan again, trying to get up, but I realize it\u2019s not happening.</p><p>And then I smell it.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Brand and Mad Dog are out there and I\u2019ve got to see if they\u2019re alive. The smell of blood is strong in the breeze, as well as burning metal, hissing gas and dust. Fuck. It takes me a minute, but I finally manage to flip onto my belly and drag myself by my elbows.</p><p>I\u2019m definitely not paralyzed and fuck, the pain has arrived. My head is screaming, but I\u2019ve got to find my friends.</p><p>Inch by painful inch, I pull myself through the carnage-riddled dust. A twisted piece of our Humvee is lodged in the ground to my left, and I can smell melting rubber as a tire burns to my right.</p><p>And then, through the smoke, I see a face on the side of the road, bloody and mud-spattered. My heart hammers as I try like hell to get to it, to see if it\u2019s Brand or Mad Dog... until I arrive and find that it\u2019s neither.</p><p>The girl\u2019s eyes are wide and open. And lifeless.</p><p>She stares at me, blaming me.</p><p>I remember everything and the memories slam into me like a freight train.</p><p>It\u2019s all my fault.</p><p>The pain in my head intensifies, like a million shards of glass, and everything fades to black.</p><p>I wake up in a cold sweat, my sheets drenched with my terror, my throat bone dry.</p><p>I lie still for a minute, sucking in coarse breaths of air as I try to force myself to calm down. The dream is so fucking real, though, as if every memory from that night is permanently imprinted in my mind. Which, of course, it is. I\u2019m never going to be free of it.</p><p>I reach for a glass of water to soothe my parched throat, only to find that I don\u2019t have a nightstand here. I\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>I pull myself into a sitting position, running a hand through my hair, before I get out of bed and make my way to the kitchen in the dark. I\u2019m still unnerved by my fucking dream, and even the shadows cast in this dark and familiar kitchen make me uneasy. The luminescent microwave clock tells me that it\u2019s five thirty a.m. The sun should be coming up soon.</p><p>I grab a bottle of water and slump into a chair at the kitchen table, gazing absently outside. Jacey\u2019s car isn\u2019t in the driveway, which means she didn\u2019t come home last night. That\u2019s a fact that pisses me off.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019s an adult. Yes, normally she could stay over at her boyfriend\u2019s without a problem. But shit. I\u2019m here so that she feels safe. If she doesn\u2019t even bother to come home, there\u2019s no sense in me being here.</p><p>I drink the water, then drink one more bottle. My mouth is still dry when I\u2019m finished. The night terrors always affect me in a very physical way... headaches, sweat, shortness of breath. It\u2019s like I\u2019m actually back in Afghanistan, actually reliving that night over and over. It\u2019s a pain in the ass.</p><p>I toss the bottles into the recycling bin and head to the bathroom. I know there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back to sleep now. I turn the water on and I\u2019m waiting for it to heat up when I hear the back door quietly open.</p><p>Jacey.</p><p>I fling open the bathroom door and storm down the hallway to find her creeping quietly through the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d I say grimly as I flip on the light. She blinks in the brightness, then grins at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, big brother,\u201d she says, as she trips on a rug. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you up.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s obviously drunk.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that you\u2019re supposed to be at work in a few hours,\u201d I point out. She doesn\u2019t seem concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she slurs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019m a big girl. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy problem would be lost on you at this particular moment,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBut trust me, we\u2019ll be talking about it later. If you ever drive home drunk again, you won\u2019t need Jared to manhandle you. I\u2019ll kick your little ass myself. Go sleep it off. We\u2019ll talk when you\u2019re coherent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she mutters as she wobbles down the hall. \u201cShows how much you know. Jared\u2019s still messing with me. He\u2019s been texting me all night. Said he\u2019s going to teach you a lesson.\u201d She kicks off one of her heels, then throws the other down the hallway in frustration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t trip on my shoe,\u201d she calls helpfully over her shoulder.</p><p>I shake my head as I follow her, stooping to pick up the offending shoe. I toss it into her bedroom as I head to the shower, stewing the entire time over my sister\u2019s dumbass ex-boyfriend and her irresponsibility. If he\u2019s been texting her all night, why the fuck didn\u2019t she call and tell me?</p><p>But there\u2019s no use trying to talk about it with her right now. It won\u2019t do any good because she wouldn\u2019t remember the conversation in the morning. I grit my teeth and try to find things to distract myself with. I clean my boots, rig the bug bombs for the spiders in the basement, and clean out my car.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, four hours later I find myself insanely restless. Jacey is still snoring in her room, although I know she\u2019ll have to get up soon if she\u2019s going to make it to work by eleven.</p> <p>I\u2019ve answered some work e-mails, touched base with Brand on the phone and gone for a thirty-minute run on the beach.</p><p>Luckily, this time I didn\u2019t run into the candy-ass that Madison was with last night. For the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out what she sees in someone like that. She actually took his side when he bitched at me for getting his fucking pants wet.</p><p>There\u2019s no logical reason that I can think of that she would prefer that guy over me.</p><p>I pointedly ignore the one thing that it might be... the thing that I\u2019m hoping like hell it\u2019s not. She might be totally turned off by me because of what she saw that night in Chicago. She might have seen too much and now she thinks I\u2019m crazy. Or a pussy.</p><p>Neither of those things is good but the problem is I have no idea what she\u2019s thinking. She wants me. I can tell. But she\u2019s icy as hell too.</p> <p>I shake my head.</p><p>I\u2019m gonna have to stop trying to figure women out, because they make no fucking sense. I\u2019m definitely not going to sit here stewing over it, but I have nothing left to do. So I do the only thing that makes sense to me.</p><p>I head out to find a gym. Lifting weights always burns restless energy. Besides, I can\u2019t stop working out just because I\u2019m no longer in the army.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take me long to find the gym since Angel Bay only has one. That actually doesn\u2019t surprise me in a town this small. In fact, I\u2019m surprised that it has one at all.</p><p>I\u2019m signed up as a member and headed back to the weight room within a few minutes. This gym is old-school, nothing fancy. The walls are white and covered with inspirational posters.</p><p>NO PAIN, NO GAIN.</p> <p>YOU MISS 100% OF THE SHOTS YOU DON\u2019T TAKE.</p><p>CLEAR YOUR MIND OF \u201cCAN\u2019T.\u201d</p><p>THE ONLY WAY TO FINISH IS TO START.</p><p>All true, all clich\u00e9.</p><p>But whatever. Clich\u00e9 or not, this is the kind of place I like. There\u2019s no coffee bar, lounge area or girls dressed to the nines. This is a gym meant for people to work out in. Those fancy places in the city make me want to punch a hole in the wall. I don\u2019t go to the gym to pick women up. I go to work out.</p><p>I do fifty curls with the twenty-pound weight before switching to the other arm. As I breathe out through my mouth, slowly and evenly, I notice Madison\u2019s brother-in-law across the room on the hip sled. Seeing someone familiar shouldn\u2019t surprise me since this town is so fucking small. I can\u2019t go anywhere without bumping into someone.</p><p>He catches my gaze and after a few minutes makes his way over to me, holding out a sweaty hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Pax Tate. My wife Mila introduced herself to you the other night. I\u2019m not as social as she is, so I didn\u2019t interrupt your dinner.\u201d The way he\u2019s grinning, it\u2019s clear Madison\u2019s sister has this guy wrapped around her finger.</p> <p>I chuckle at the memory. \u201cIt was no problem. I get the feeling that Angel Bay doesn\u2019t get many new people. She was curious. And thanks for stepping up with Jared. I didn\u2019t get a chance to say anything to you that night.\u201d</p><p>Pax rolls his eyes. \u201cMila thought you might need some backup. I was pretty sure you had it under control. And yeah, she\u2019s curious. More about you and her sister, but whatever. Women.\u201d He rolls his eyes again. \u201cI could use a spotter for the bench. You got a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I get up and follow him to the bench, waiting until he is situated on his back before lifting the three-hundred-pound-laden bar off the rungs and handing it to him.</p><p>\u201cWhy is Mila fascinated with Madison and me?\u201d I ask as I count his reps. He\u2019s strong and in shape. He does fifteen with no problem before setting the bar back into the holder.</p><p>\u201cBecause Maddy doesn\u2019t date. You\u2019re the first person she\u2019s shown any interest in for a long time. And trust me, Mila is fascinated with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018showing interest,\u2019 do you mean that she absolutely refused to even look at me the other day in the restaurant? Until she bitched at me for being too rough with Jared, that is.\u201d</p><p>Pax looks at me as we switch places and he hands me the bar. As I bench the weight, I explain how we met and how she definitely didn\u2019t want anyone to hear about it at the Hill, especially her sister. He bursts out laughing.</p><p>\u201cThat does sound like Madison. She wouldn\u2019t want to give Mila any ammunition. Was she mad that you dared to show up at her restaurant or what?\u201d</p><p>I nod, hooking the bar into the rungs again, then pausing to catch my breath. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical Madison,\u201d Pax chuckles. \u201cBut deep down she\u2019s sweet, once you get past her outer bitchiness. I heard her bitch at you for the Jared thing. I probably shouldn\u2019t say anything, but she\u2019s got hang-ups with that shit so don\u2019t take it personally. Mila and Madison\u2019s dad used to knock their mom around so she\u2019s got a thing about any kind of violence at all.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a minute, thinking back to the other night at the Hill when she told Jacey that her dad had a temper like Jared\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I mutter aloud. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Pax nods. \u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>I think of Madison, of how she\u2019s so confident and strong, and I can\u2019t picture her involved in an abusive relationship of any sort.</p><p>\u201cDid their dad hit them, or just their mom?\u201d</p><p>Pax shakes his head as we switch places so he can do his second set. \u201cHe never laid a hand on Mila. But I can\u2019t say for sure about Maddy. It\u2019s not exactly something we sit down and talk about.\u201d</p><p>Pax stops talking as he runs out of breath while he\u2019s benching. I let this conversation go. It\u2019s not my business and I can see that he\u2019s not that comfortable talking about it anyway.</p><p>When we switch places for my second set, Pax changes the subject.</p><p>\u201cSo are you sticking around for a while? What do you do?\u201d</p><p>I explain my situation, why I\u2019m here and the fledgling company I co-own. Pax seems particularly interested in DefenseTech.</p><p>\u201cAdvanced body armor? That\u2019s badass... makes me think of Batman. You know, my family\u2019s company is looking to diversify and invest in something new. This honestly sounds like something I might be interested in. I\u2019ve got a tight schedule this week, but let\u2019s hook up and talk next week.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m beyond surprised that an opportunity like this would fall into my lap, but I try not to act like it. When I tell Brand, he\u2019s going to shit. I keep my face calm.</p><p>\u201cSure, that sounds great. I\u2019ll give you a call later in the week to set it up.\u201d</p><p>Pax nods. \u201cRemind me to give you my card before you go.\u201d</p><p>We switch places and I do my second set.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly was going on the other night with Jared? I forgot to ask. He\u2019s an asshat, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d I tell him. \u201cApparently he\u2019s been giving my little sister a hard time because she broke up with him. After the other night, I figured I\u2019d scared him into leaving her alone. But Jacey told me this morning that he was harassing her all night last night.\u201d</p><p>Pax thinks about that for a minute, almost hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably too stupid to be scared, to be honest. He\u2019s got more attitude than brains. I know that for a fact. I stomped him into the ground when he went after Mila, but he wouldn\u2019t stay down. I think it\u2019s his pride, to be honest. If someone attacks his pride, he gets crazy. And in his eyes, your sister attacked his pride by breaking up with him. And then you embarrassed him at the Hill.\u201d</p><p>I nod. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s right.</p><p>Pax continues. \u201cSo in all honesty, you might want to watch your back. He\u2019s an unbalanced dumbass. But he\u2019s a predictable unbalanced dumbass. He goes to the Bear\u2019s Den downtown every day for lunch\u2014and then he hangs out there pretty much every night. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re in the mood for a hamburger, are you?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in surprise at the abrupt change of topic. \u201cUh, I guess. I could always eat a burger.\u201d</p><p>Pax grins. \u201cGood. Because the Bear\u2019s Den makes the best burgers in town.\u201d</p><p>I grin back, handing the bar to him.</p><p>\u201cOh. In that case, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>We hit the showers and as we\u2019re getting dressed, I say, \u201cSo I heard you broke Jared\u2019s hand that night.\u201d</p><p>Pax grins. \u201cI should\u2019ve broken both of them,\u201d he says, yanking a gray T-shirt down over his heavily muscled torso. \u201cThat prick seriously needs to learn a lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I tell him as I grab my bag. I follow him out to his car, a mint-condition 1968 black Dodge Charger.</p><p>\u201cSweet car,\u201d I tell him in appreciation. \u201cI have a new Camaro, but I tell ya, I\u2019ve always loved these classics.\u201d</p><p>Pax looks up and grins proudly. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ve had it for years. It takes a lot of maintenance and breaks down more often than it runs, but I fucking love these pipes. Get in. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>The Bear\u2019s Den is almost close enough to walk to, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot more fun in the Charger. Pax revs the engine as we drive downtown, turning the heads of people on the sidewalk. He doesn\u2019t even look at them as he pulls into a parking spot and we head into the darkened bar. I glance around, but don\u2019t spot anyone vaguely familiar.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here yet,\u201d Pax confirms. \u201cBut let\u2019s order our food and wait. Trust me, he\u2019ll be here. That fucking loser practically lives here.\u201d</p><p>We each order a burger and a beer, sitting down in a back booth. I watch the door as we talk. Pax asks me questions about being a Ranger and I answer them as best I can.</p><p>\u201cIt was something I always knew I wanted to do,\u201d I tell him. \u201cFrom the time I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you retire so young?\u201d Pax asks curiously.</p><p>It\u2019s a question that I ought to be used to because everyone asks it. I ought to have a canned answer ready, but I don\u2019t. So each time someone asks, it hits me in the gut and I flounder for a second, trying to decide what to say.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize what it\u2019s really like over there,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking brutal. I can handle brutal, but one night, shit got really fucking real and a good friend died in the process. Brand and I came out of it alive, but it totally messed us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude.\u201d Pax looks at me seriously and somewhat uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know. I respect the hell out of what you did as a Ranger. I know you probably don\u2019t want to talk about it and God knows I hate to talk about shit, but I\u2019m always up for a beer if you want one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile and gulp my beer. \u201cThanks. I hate to talk about shit too. I mean, what the hell\u2019s the point? People can\u2019t understand when they haven\u2019t lived through something like that.\u201d</p><p>Pax stares at me again, then looks down at his hand. He\u2019s got a jagged scar on his thumb in the shape of an X and I stare at it too, wondering about its significance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at what people understand.\u201d</p><p>He takes another swig of his beer, then looks at the door in satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cLook who just walked in.\u201d</p><p>I glance up to find Jared swaggering into the bar. His clothes are sweaty and dirty and it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s on his lunch break.</p><p>He orders, then makes his way to the bathroom, presumably to wash up. Pax jerks his head in that direction as he gets up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll watch the door,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cUnless you need me?\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p> <p>I follow Pax to the bathroom. When we get there, he stands to the side and lets me pass. The bartender meets my gaze for just a moment, but then looks away. He\u2019s not going to interfere.</p><p>An almost euphoric feeling comes over me as I enter the bathroom and look around. The rush of adrenaline pulsing through me right now is an old welcome friend. I haven\u2019t felt like this since I left the Rangers.</p><p>I wait patiently behind him while the dumbass uses the urinal and then washes his hands. When he turns around at the sink, I bury my fingers in his neck and slam him hard against the bathroom stall.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he manages to say, his face registering surprise. And fear. Good, because he should fear me.</p><p>At his words I clench my hand tighter into his trachea, hard enough that he can no longer speak, hard enough that I can feel the cartilage rings in his windpipe. He struggles to swallow against the pads of my fingers and I smile.</p><p>\u201cQuit talking,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd listen. I thought I told you to leave my sister alone. If you keep harassing her, I will fuck you up. If I see you lurking around her house, parked on our street or anywhere within a mile radius of her, I will rip your spine out and feed it to you, bone by bone. You must be too stupid to understand English, because I already told you once. This is twice. I won\u2019t tell you a third time. I don\u2019t like dumbasses. I especially don\u2019t like dumbasses who fuck with my sister.\u201d</p> <p>I jerk my knee up into his gut and he grunts, his eyes shooting daggers at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking around. Leave her alone. Got it?\u201d</p><p>He nods and I release him. He immediately rubs at his neck and glares at me again.</p><p>\u201cYour sister is a lying whore,\u201d he snarls. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since the other night.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a beat, I slam his face into the lip of the sink. As I yank him back up by the hair, his mouth gushes stringy red saliva.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking prick,\u201d he rasps, spitting out a bloody tooth.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know. But I warned you what would happen if you called my sister a whore again. Leave her the fuck alone. This is the last time I tell you.\u201d</p><p>I turn to leave, and Jared lunges at me from behind. I easily grab his arm and throw him over my head and into the wall. He slides to the ground, heaving as he glares up at me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me again,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd don\u2019t fuck with Jacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d he mutters, but I ignore it.</p><p>I walk out and leave him on the bathroom floor.</p><p>Pax looks at me. \u201cTaken care of?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cFor now. If he tries anything else, I\u2019ll fuck him up for real. He might be a slow learner, but he\u2019s gotta learn sometime.\u201d</p><p>Pax shakes his head. \u201cWhat a dumbass. Did he come at you? I heard the crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. From behind.\u201d</p><p>Pax shakes his head again.</p><p>\u201cFucking pussy,\u201d he mutters. \u201cHe\u2019s a waste of oxygen.\u201d</p><p>He focuses on his phone, then looks at me. \u201cMila just texted me. Her art shop is just down the street. She locked her keys in her car. Do you mind if we stop there on the way back to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d I tell him. We toss some bills down to cover our lunches and walk back out into the sunshine. Mila\u2019s shop is literally fifty paces from the Bear\u2019s Den and her face lights up when we walk in and she sees her husband.</p><p>She\u2019s standing on a stepladder wearing a paint smock, hanging a painting on a thin steel cord. Pax immediately grumbles and heads for her, holding her legs to steady her.</p><p>\u201cMila, for fuck\u2019s sake. Get the hell off the ladder. You\u2019re going to break your neck.\u201d</p><p>She just smiles and shakes her head as she climbs down, ignoring his extended hand.</p><p>\u201cPax. Seriously. I\u2019m pregnant, not sick or crippled. It\u2019s OK.\u201d She turns to me, rolling her eyes good-naturedly. \u201cWell, well. Gabriel. It\u2019s so nice to see you again.\u201d She looks from Pax to me curiously. \u201cThis is strange. Why are you two together?\u201d</p><p>Pax grins. \u201cWhat? Am I so unlikable that I can\u2019t make friends?\u201d</p><p>Mila laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re not unlikable. You\u2019re overprotective. And of course you can make friends. You\u2019re charming. You just don\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p><p>He waggles his eyebrows. \u201cOh, I realize it, baby.\u201d</p><p>Mila giggles and turns to me. \u201cThank you, guys, for coming to unlock my car. I have pregnancy brain. I\u2019m so forgetful. No one told me that it would affect my memory too.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Pax\u2019s turn to roll his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBabe, let\u2019s just face it. Your memory was never good. You can blame heartburn on the baby, gas on the baby, weight gain on the baby... but you really can\u2019t blame your bad memory on the poor thing.\u201d</p><p>Mila blushes and slaps at his arm. \u201cPax, seriously. I don\u2019t have gas. I\u2019m a delicate flower.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes again. \u201cWhatever you say, sweet. You fart with the best of \u2019em in your sleep. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Mila blushes darker. \u201cI\u2019m going to pretend you didn\u2019t just say that in front of someone.\u201d She turns to me again. \u201cJust keep in mind that I\u2019m pregnant, Gabe. It does horrible things to the body.\u201d She grins charmingly. \u201cWhat brings you back to Angel Bay? I thought you lived in Chicago. \u201d</p><p>I decide that small-town people have no compunction whatsoever about asking nosy questions and that I shouldn\u2019t be annoyed. It would be impossible to be annoyed with Mila Tate anyway. She\u2019s as genuine a person as I\u2019ve ever met.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m here to stay for a while. Jacey\u2019s having a problem with an ex-boyfriend and I\u2019m here as her security detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe. Jared Markson is still fucking with them, even after that scene at the Hill the other night. I told Gabriel how you aren\u2019t a fan of the guy either,\u201d Pax says as he wraps an arm around his wife. \u201cAnd I told him why.\u201d</p><p>Mila raises an eyebrow. \u201cSo you told him that you broke Jared\u2019s hand?\u201d</p><p>Pax grins smugly. \u201cYep. And how I wish I\u2019d broken them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might have made things easier,\u201d I answer wryly. \u201cBut whatever. I\u2019ll take care of it. He\u2019ll wish he hadn\u2019t messed with Jacey, I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just be careful,\u201d Mila cautions me, her face concerned. \u201cHe used to be a pretty decent guy, back in high school. But he\u2019s got a problem with alcohol and it makes him mean. He\u2019s not worth you getting hurt or into trouble. Trust me on that.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t get hurt. And I won\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p><p>Pax grins at me. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. If you need help, let me know. I\u2019m still holding a grudge.\u201d</p><p>While Mila asks us to not personally get involved with Jared, to call the police instead, the bells over the shop door jingle and we all turn to find Madison walking in.</p><p>She looks drop-dead gorgeous in a slim skirt that hugs her swaying hips, and knee-high tan boots.</p><p>She\u2019s smoking hot. And surprised as hell to find me here. She\u2019s got that deer-caught-in-the-headlights look and I have to chuckle at it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Madison,\u201d I can\u2019t help but say. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m taunting her and she knows it. I can see her face freeze up, then relax as she consciously makes the effort to hide her surprise. It\u2019s an effort that amuses me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see you too,\u201d she tells me as she strolls through the shop toward us. \u201cAre you an art collector? Or an artist? My sister sells art and art supplies, so either way, you\u2019re in the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m just out for lunch with Pax,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd Mila locked her keys in her car, so Pax came to save the day.\u201d</p><p>Madison glances at Mila. \u201cPregnancy brain?\u201d</p><p>Pax rolls his eyes at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy. There\u2019s no such thing.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle as Mila protests, but she abruptly stops and sniffs at the air.</p><p>\u201cSomething smells good.\u201d She continues to sniff toward Madison.</p><p>Madison shakes her head and hands Mila a bag. \u201cYou\u2019ve seriously got the nose of a bloodhound now. It\u2019s soup. Tony said to eat it all or he will come over here and spoon-feed it to you. He said it doesn\u2019t matter if your morning sickness is back or not, you\u2019ve still got to eat. And he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Mila takes it and glances at me. \u201cTony is the bartender at the Hill. He\u2019s been with us forever and he\u2019s a little protective of my sister and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Pax says under his breath. To me he says, \u201cHe threatened to break my kneecaps if I ever mistreated Mila.\u201d</p><p>I smile because Tony seems like my kind of guy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell Mila. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta respect that, though.\u201d</p><p>Mila rolls her eyes. \u201cMen.\u201d But she obediently pulls out the Styrofoam container of soup and sniffs at it. \u201cEating this will be such a hardship.\u201d She grins and spoons some into her mouth. \u201cVery hard.\u201d</p><p>Mila continues eating while Pax goes outside to unlock her SUV. While he does, I can\u2019t help but stare at Madison discreetly.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful woman in person before. She seems like she stepped right out of the pages of a magazine. I can\u2019t tell if she knows how gorgeous she is. Most women know and use it to their every advantage. But Madison doesn\u2019t seem to play that card. She seems to rely on her prickly personality instead.</p><p>Unfortunately she notices my covert gaze and the corner of her mouth turns up.</p><p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d she asks quietly. I grin back.</p><p>\u201cI was just noticing the difference between you and your sister. You don\u2019t look a lot alike. Mila\u2019s small and dark, and you\u2019re tall and pale.\u201d</p><p>When Madison\u2019s cheeks flush, I realize that I could\u2019ve used more tact. She might be self-conscious about the fact that she\u2019s bigger than her sister. Women are weird about that shit. But honestly, she\u2019s taller. She\u2019s willowy, like a model.</p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt was just an observation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d she lies. I know it\u2019s a lie by the way her cheeks are still stained pink. In fact, the flush has spread down to her chest.</p><p>I\u2019m saved by the bells on the door, though, as Pax returns, tossing Mila\u2019s keys to her.</p><p>\u201cAll fixed,\u201d he tells her. \u201cGood thing I have an extra key. You\u2019re good to go, pregnant brain.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, but thanks him. \u201cThere is one more thing before you go,\u201d she mentions. \u201cCould you move some boxes for me in the back? Supplies came this morning.\u201d</p> <p>Pax stares at her in surprise. \u201cGood lord. Have all of my lectures finally paid off? Thank you for not trying to move them yourself, for once.\u201d</p><p>Mila smiles gently, but as they walk away she turns and mouths Overprotective as she points to Pax\u2019s back. Madison grins.</p><p>\u201cHe is overprotective,\u201d she tells me as the other two disappear into a back room. \u201cBut it\u2019s sweet. I never thought Pax had it in him when I first met him. He\u2019s like a different person. He had sort of a shitty childhood, but he\u2019s going to be a great dad. Speaking of him, though, I didn\u2019t realize that you were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ran into each other at the gym this morning. And then we had a little run-in with Jared over lunch. Pax had my back again, which I appreciate. He\u2019s a stand-up guy,\u201d I answer. \u201cI should\u2019ve asked him if he served. He seems like that kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>Madison practically chokes. \u201cServed? As in the military? Um, no. Pax used to be kind of messed up. The military wasn\u2019t something that would have appealed to him.\u201d</p> <p>I eye her. \u201cMessed up?\u201d</p><p>Madison stares at me, her blue eyes very dark and instantly troubled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. When he was seven, his mom was killed in front of him. It messed him up pretty bad. For years he couldn\u2019t even remember exactly what happened. That\u2019s how bad it was. I thought he was beyond saving, but Mila didn\u2019t give up. She sees the good in people better than I do. And she was right. Pax came through it just fine. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in horror. His own mother was killed in front of him? I thought I\u2019d seen some shit.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I answer. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. That scar on his hand... was that part of it?\u201d</p><p>Madison nods. \u201cYeah.\u201d She suddenly looks uncomfortable. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is his story to tell. I don\u2019t feel like I should talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>I nod slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. He might share it himself sometime over a beer.\u201d</p><p>Madison actually looks guilty as she curls into a red chair. \u201cHe might, and if he does, good for him. He got counseling last year when all of his memories came to light. But I\u2019m a big believer that you can\u2019t talk things out too much. The more the better.\u201d</p><p>I cringe at that as I take the chair next to her, because I strongly disagree. I don\u2019t see the point in talking about shit. People can\u2019t fix what happened to you.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s change the subject,\u201d I suggest. \u201cHow\u2019s your boyfriend? Did he get his candy-ass pants cleaned?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me solemnly, but the corner of her lip is twitching again, making me wonder why. Is she glad I asked about that guy? Is this a game of cat and mouse?</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think Ethan is my boyfriend?\u201d she counters, a question with a question. Classic deflection.</p><p>Now it\u2019s my lip that\u2019s twitching, but not from amusement. I hate games.</p><p>\u201cWell, the two of you seemed pretty cozy the other night. I felt bad about jogging right through the middle of your date,\u201d I finally answer.</p> <p>She stares into my eyes and I see the blatant question there.</p><p>Do you want to play?</p><p>I stare back with an answer.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Madison leans back in her chair, her eyes pointedly on my face, the air charged around us. The attraction between us is potent, yet we\u2019re sitting here talking about her date with another guy.</p><p>We\u2019re definitely playing now. Only right now I\u2019m not sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t feel bad,\u201d she says smoothly. \u201cEthan and I are very old friends. It wasn\u2019t a bother at all. Until you stopped and pushed him around, that is.\u201d</p><p>I snort. \u201cYour candy-ass boyfriend started it. And I didn\u2019t lay one finger on him. If I wanted to push him around, you\u2019d both know it.\u201d</p><p>Madison doesn\u2019t react to that, her face is a perfect expressionless mask.</p><p>\u201cWere you dating Ethan when we met at the club?\u201d I ask curiously. Madison doesn\u2019t seem like the type to cheat, but then what the hell do I know? My training is in military tactics. I honestly don\u2019t know shit about the inner workings of the female mind.</p><p>She flushes again, probably thinking back to that night and how she was so very willing to go home with me.</p><p>Thinking about it actually stirs my dick to life and I shift in my seat, picturing the way her nipple tasted in my mouth and how her soft lips felt against mine. The simple thought makes me hard and I shift my hand so that it\u2019s covering my telltale crotch.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Madison answers quickly, her slender hand fluttering up to push her hair behind her ear. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI just thought I\u2019d ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Looking out for Ethan\u2019s best interests?\u201d she asks me sharply. I stare down at her, my eyes frozen on hers... unwavering.</p><p>\u201cNo... my own. You aren\u2019t really into Ethan. You\u2019re into me.\u201d</p><p>I drop my hand now, until it rests softly on the edge of her knee, my knuckles barely grazing her thigh.</p><p>I am sure that she wants me, although I\u2019m not sure exactly why.</p><p>It was there the other night even when she was with Ethan. It\u2019s in her eyes, in the way she finds me wherever I\u2019m at in the room. It\u2019s crackling in the air between us.</p><p>She wants me. And I want her.</p><p>Fucking her would be like harnessing a raging summer storm. And some weird part of me wants to make up for melting down on her that first night, to prove that I\u2019m not a weak-ass pussy.</p><p>There is a pregnant pause before Madison bursts out laughing, not exactly the response I had been expecting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty sure of yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I dismiss her words. \u201cBut you know it\u2019s true. You\u2019re into me and you have been since you met me. We\u2019d be able to get someplace if you\u2019d just admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what place, exactly, are we trying to get to?\u201d She laughs again, but there is something in her eyes that tells me I\u2019m right. Something about the way she turns her body toward me, in the way her hands can\u2019t be still when she\u2019s talking to me. She\u2019s on edge around me.</p><p>Yet she still leaves my hand on her thigh. The heat from her radiates into my palm and I itch to move it upward.</p><p>But I don\u2019t. I leave it still as I stare into her eyes.</p><p>I want her to ask me for it. Eventually she will say my name and ask me to fuck her.</p><p>It\u2019s all part of the game.</p><p>She grows serious now, turning to face me head on in her seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat I will admit is that ever since that first night, I\u2019ve been curious about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I raise an eyebrow, ignoring my trepidation, ignoring the way my heart starts to pound. This is it. I\u2019m going to see what she knows. What she saw. And from the unsettled look on her face, it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>Madison actually looks nervous, but she lifts her chin and looks me in the eye anyway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been driving me crazy trying to figure it out because everything I\u2019ve seen of you since then doesn\u2019t match. You totally lost your shit, Gabriel. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. You totally lost your shit, Gabriel.</p><p>I yank my hand away and try to pretend that I\u2019m normal. That it was no big deal. It sucks the air out of me because I hate that she saw it. It makes me feel weak. That\u2019s something I\u2019m not. And it is a big deal.</p><p>She\u2019s waiting for an answer, her stare unwavering.</p><p>Do you want to play? Yes or no?</p><p>I shake my head. I only like to play when I have the upper hand.</p><p>So I try to deflect by being vague.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Let\u2019s just say that everyone has demons and I haven\u2019t shown mine who\u2019s boss yet.\u201d</p><p>Madison stares at me for a moment more and then she speaks. Her tone is soft now, sympathetic almost. It makes me cringe. I don\u2019t want her fucking sympathy.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not really the explanation I was hoping for, but whatever. Maybe someday you\u2019ll tell me. And if there\u2019s one thing I learned from Pax, it\u2019s that everyone has demons. I have no doubt that you can whip your demon\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>She smiles another sympathetic smile and I can\u2019t take it anymore. I hate that she thinks I need her pity. So I do what I do best. I deflect by being an ass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re so understanding,\u201d I tell her. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll give me a second chance.\u201d</p><p>She raises a slender eyebrow. \u201cA second chance? For what?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cTo show you my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>My cocky words don\u2019t have the effect I thought they would. Sexual tension flares between us like a live wire and Madison laughs again, a genuine and sexy laugh.</p><p>Leaning up toward me, she lays a hand on my thigh, moving her fingers ever so slightly upward as she murmurs into my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already seen your bedroom. How do you think you got home that night?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. I can\u2019t breathe as I stare into her blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d I ask quickly, before I can think about what I\u2019m saying. All I can think about is the hole I found in my hallway the next morning.</p><p>Maddy\u2019s head snaps up, her blue eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d she answers in surprise. \u201cYou were just out of it. You seemed to have a little issue with your wall. It offended you somehow and you punched the crap out of it. But you didn\u2019t lay a finger on me. Why?\u201d</p><p>I relax, my shoulders settling back to where they should be. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that like it sounded.\u201d I attempt to cover. \u201cI meant in the taxi, when I dropped down on top of you...\u201d</p><p>My fumbling attempts are interrupted by Mila and Pax\u2019s return.</p><p>Thank you, God.</p><p>Madison smiles up at her sister and almost imperceptibly moves away from me.</p><p>The moment between us is over but I have more questions than I know what to do with. Did she put me to bed? What did I say to her? This whole time I\u2019ve tried to pretend it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve tried to tell myself that it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>But it does.</p><p>What did I do?</p><p>I don\u2019t fucking know.</p><p>She looks at me, amusement in her eyes. She likes that I\u2019m puzzled. She likes thinking she has the upper hand. She likes playing this game.</p><p>Whatever she witnessed that night, she thinks it gives her an edge. She thinks she\u2019s the cat in this conversation.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>I turn to Pax. \u201cHey, dude. You about ready? I\u2019ve got a date tonight. I should get going.\u201d</p><p>I turn to smirk at Madison, but the look on her face deflates me. For just a second, before she closes up again, she looks crushed and I fucking hate that I did that. I only meant to take the upper hand again. I didn\u2019t mean to actually hurt her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before I can add that my date is with my friend Brand, Madison gets up and turns her back on me in dismissal as she makes a pointed effort of asking Mila about a piece of art on the wall.</p><p>I sigh as I follow Pax to the door.</p><p>Sometimes being the cat isn\u2019t as fun as it should be.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p> <p>Madison</p><p>Oh my God. What. A. Fucking. Prick.</p><p>My thoughts form in time with my feet as they pound against the packed sand of the beach. I tossed and turned all night because of that egotistical asshole and here I am out running at seven a.m. This is so unlike me. I don\u2019t go running. I don\u2019t feel the need to burn off nervous or frustrated energy.</p><p>I don\u2019t.</p><p>Yet here I am. Because I can\u2019t get that cocky grin out of my head or the way he so casually told me that I was into him, then turned around and mentioned that he had a date. As if I care who he dates or who he fucks.</p> <p>And he was so surprised that I walked him home. How the hell did he think he got home? Does he truly not remember it at all? Is that why he hasn\u2019t mentioned it?</p><p>If that\u2019s the case, what in the hell is wrong with him?</p><p>Did I hurt you?</p><p>What a strange thing to ask. His rushed explanation didn\u2019t hold water because we hadn\u2019t been talking about the taxi crash at all. We were talking about me being in his bedroom.</p><p>Did I hurt you?</p><p>Did I hurt you?</p> <p>I can\u2019t get his question, sudden and anxious, out of my head.</p><p>My feet fall hard, one after the other, as I slam them into the ground. The crisp spring air stings my throat as I suck it into my lungs, trying to breathe, but at the same time enjoying the discomfort. It distracts me from the pissed-off feelings coursing through me. I hate feeling affected like this. I hate that he affected me like this.</p><p>Because I do care who he dates. And who he fucks. I don\u2019t know why; all I know is that I do.</p><p>Effffff.</p><p>The sun is beautiful at this time of day and regardless of my pissed-off state, I can\u2019t help but appreciate it. The lake is calm this morning, tranquil and silent. There isn\u2019t even a breeze to stir the grass on the dunes above me. It\u2019s like God is giving me a break, letting me get my thoughts together.</p><p>The problem is, I can\u2019t make sense of my thoughts. I can\u2019t make sense of why I\u2019m attracted to a guy who has an ego bigger than the state of Michigan and who clearly has two tons of personal baggage.</p><p>Everyone has baggage, though, my inner voice tells me. Even you.</p><p>Screw that. My baggage doesn\u2019t come close to his. My parents died. End of story. Well, maybe I have a few trust issues because of their relationship. But who wouldn\u2019t in my shoes? Well, maybe not Mila. But that\u2019s just because she didn\u2019t see as much as I did. I shielded her from it.</p> <p>Seriously. It\u2019s no wonder that I suck at relationships.</p><p>But my issues are nowhere near the level of Gabriel\u2019s. I don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s dealing with, but it\u2019s far worse than anything I\u2019ve known. I can see it in his eyes. And of course there was that question. Did I hurt you?</p><p>My phone buzzes, interrupting my thoughts, and I reach into the pocket of my hoodie, stooping over to breathe as I read it.</p><p>I have a free morning. Want to get breakfast?</p><p>Ethan.</p><p>I feel a stab of guilt. I\u2019ve ignored a few of his texts this week or just barely responded. I can\u2019t keep ignoring them; it\u2019s rude and he doesn\u2019t deserve that. At the very least I should tell him in person that we can\u2019t date. Or maybe I\u2019m wrong about the whole thing. Maybe I should try going out with him one more time.</p><p>Sure. I\u2019m jogging, let me change my clothes and take a quick shower, I answer. It takes him two seconds to reply.</p><p>Perfect. I\u2019ll pick you up in 30.</p><p>I jog home and quickly shower and dress. Ethan picks me up in thirty minutes on the dot. He looks like a model in GQ magazine this morning, wearing khaki shorts, a button-up and a hundred-watt grin.</p><p>\u201cMorning, gorgeous,\u201d he greets me when I open the door. \u201cI was thinking we could go to that little caf\u00e9 on the beach in Oval Cove. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat actually does,\u201d I admit as I grab my purse. \u201cI haven\u2019t been there in forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to stop and get gas first,\u201d Ethan says as we walk to his car. \u201cBut then we\u2019re outta here.\u201d</p><p>I have to smile. Yes, he\u2019s vanilla. He\u2019s bland. He\u2019s even boring. But I know him. And he knows me. There\u2019s definitely comfort in familiarity.</p><p>And he\u2019d never play dumbass games that would hurt me on purpose. I know that.</p><p>Maybe I shouldn\u2019t dismiss him so quickly.</p><p>We chat as Ethan drives down the road to a gas station. Bland, yet safe conversation. How many babies have you delivered this week? Four? That\u2019s incredible. I still can\u2019t get over the fact that you\u2019re a doctor. He laughs and I laugh and there is absolutely no chemistry.</p><p>But I\u2019m not giving up yet.</p><p>Maybe we could be one of those couples who grow into love. And who cares about the chemistry? There are people out there in arranged marriages. They\u2019ve got it way worse than this.</p><p>As Ethan pulls into the gas station, I\u2019m distracted by wondering if arranged marriages are still actually a thing.</p><p>And then I\u2019m distracted by my bladder, which is apparently as small as a peanut. Using a gas station bathroom is disgusting, but a girl\u2019s gotta do what a girl\u2019s gotta do. I find it surprisingly clean, though. Thank God. I still wag my butt above the toilet, refusing to touch the seat, just in case.</p><p>As I make my way back outside, I pause at the doors, staring through the glass.</p><p>Jared Markson is at the pump next to Ethan\u2019s, filling up his work truck. Ugh. After the other night, he\u2019s the last person I want to see.</p><p>I stare at the bulldog set of his jaw, at the way he almost seems dirty even before his workday has begun, and I shake my head. I can\u2019t imagine what Jacey ever saw in that guy. He was a jerk even back in high school. Some things never change.</p><p>With a sigh I glance over at Ethan. Oblivious to Jared, he\u2019s filling up his BMW, talking on his phone and glancing at his watch.</p><p>Some things definitely don\u2019t change.</p><p>Ethan is perfunctory and efficient. Perfect for a doctor, but probably not the best qualities in bed.</p><p>I remember Gabriel slipping his fingers into me and then licking them. Holy shit. My cheeks ignite. Where did that come from?</p><p>I shake the thoughts from my head and push open the door, walking toward Ethan\u2019s car, but of course Jared catches sight of me and turns. His top lip is split and scabbed over, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from spreading into a leer and exposing chew-stained teeth, one of which is missing.</p><p>Gross.</p><p>\u201cMadison,\u201d he calls. \u201cYou can tell your slut of a friend to stop lying about me.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? I can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019s talking about but I would rather die than ask. I continue walking, trying to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cMad-dddyyy,\u201d he calls mockingly.</p><p>He steps around the concrete island and approaches me. Ethan looks up now, distracted from his phone call by Jared\u2019s loud voice. Surprisingly, though, he stays put, leaning against his car and watching curiously rather than hanging up his phone.</p><p>Geez. Thanks for the backup, Ethan.</p><p>With a sigh I turn to Jared.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I demand. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for you, Jared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, tell your slut of a friend to stop lying about me.\u201d Jared enunciates every word slowly and loudly, as if I\u2019m dumb. I glare at him as I start walking again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about and I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Jared\u2019s hiss halts my steps. \u201cJacey was right about you, you know. You\u2019re a spoiled bitch. You have no idea what the real world is like. You\u2019ve had everything handed to you your whole life.\u201d</p><p>I freeze, anger flooding through me until my vision almost blurs at the corners of my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJacey would never say that,\u201d I snap. \u201cBecause she knows better.\u201d</p><p>Jared skirts around me and gets in my face, invading my personal space like an annoying ankle-biting dog. \u201cBut she did. And she was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better than that,\u201d I tell him icily, knowing full well that he\u2019s lying just to get under my skin. \u201cDo you consider having my parents killed in a head-on crash with an eighteen-wheeler \u2018having everything handed to me\u2019? Or did I have something handed to me when I had to come home from New York and live my life next to worthless fucks like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is making you stay here,\u201d Jared snarls. \u201cAnd in fact, I\u2019d like it better if you left. But before you go, tell your slut friend to lay off the bullshit. If I wanted to fuck with her, I would. Until then, I would appreciate it if she didn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your messenger,\u201d I snap. \u201cAnd neither of us are interested in anything you have to say.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my arm and I whirl around.</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hand off of me.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see Ethan take one step and then stop. He\u2019s not on his phone anymore, but he still doesn\u2019t come to help. Jared grins at me, close enough that I can smell his rancid morning breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make me, princess?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to answer, but someone else answers first, a husky and familiar voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d be happy to.\u201d</p><p>Without even turning around, I recognize that deep voice, the rich timbre, the steady tone.</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>Unconsciously my body relaxes ever so slightly in relief, as though I\u2019ve been waiting for him to arrive and didn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>I exhale slowly, turning to find Gabriel standing on the pavement with two breakfast burritos in his hand. His other hand is flexing as it dangles by his thigh. He\u2019s staring at Jared with unflinching precision.</p><p>His gaze is undeniably lethal.</p><p>It\u2019s frightening in its intensity.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Jared mutters under his breath. Looking up at Gabriel, he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no problem here, man. I was just explaining that to Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t,\u201d I answer firmly, stepping out of his grasp. \u201cYou wanted me to take Jacey a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d Gabriel raises an eyebrow.</p><p>Jared doesn\u2019t answer, so I do.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to tell her to stop lying. And he called her a slut.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but add that last part on. Jared so deserves it and he\u2019s so obviously scared of Gabriel.</p><p>Gabriel calmly sets his breakfast down on the roof of his car and approaches us. His gaze hasn\u2019t moved from Jared. It\u2019s like watching a lion and its prey. It\u2019s fascinating to witness.</p><p>I step back.</p><p>Gabriel steps forward.</p><p>Jared turns around.</p><p>\u201cFuck this,\u201d he mutters. \u201cThat bitch isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>He bolts for his truck and peels out from the parking lot.</p><p>Gabriel stands still, watching him go. Then he turns to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asks quietly, his dark eyes flitting over me, checking for damage. I nod, noticing the way Gabriel is dressed in workout clothes, the way his T-shirt clings to his broad chest, the fabric skimming over his chiseled abs. I swallow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly this doesn\u2019t seem like a game anymore. Gabriel is serious and concerned, strong and lethal.</p><p>And I want him.</p><p>I want him.</p><p>I want him.</p> <p>I swallow, dropping my gaze before he can see the truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Jared is just an ass. He\u2019s always had a temper problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddy!\u201d Ethan calls, coming forward now that it\u2019s safe. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>No thanks to you, I think, utterly disappointed in everything about him. His candy-ass clothes, his bland personality, his ability to stand aside and watch Jared harass me.</p><p>I hate violence and I hate bullies, but standing up for someone smaller or weaker is something different entirely.</p> <p>And Ethan didn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Resentment wells up in me. Seriously. He was ten yards away. He could\u2019ve stepped up to help, but he didn\u2019t. What kind of man does that?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I sigh, fighting the urge to be a bitch, fighting the urge to tell him what a pussy he is. \u201cGabriel stepped in.\u201d</p><p>I turn abruptly, blocking Ethan from my sight. It might be rude, but I\u2019m pissed.</p><p>All I want to look at now is Gabriel. I want to revel in the fact that he stood up for me. He stepped in when he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>No one\u2019s ever done that for me before.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell Gabe simply. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d he asks doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not going to watch something like that without stepping in. You were holding your own like a champ, but once he put his hands on you, it was game over.\u201d</p><p>I nod, suddenly feeling a little choked up.</p><p>Gabriel is night and Ethan is day. And all of a sudden I see the beauty in that.</p><p>Yeah, Ethan is a doctor who is trained to save lives. But he doesn\u2019t have it in him to stand up to someone if he needs to. And even though I should probably respect that about him since I hate violence, I just can\u2019t. I need someone who can walk a thin line\u2014someone who isn\u2019t a bully, someone who isn\u2019t violent, but someone who has the ability to summon up all the fury of hell if he needs to protect someone.</p><p>Someone like Gabriel.</p><p>Gabriel has been trained to protect people at all costs, even if the cost is his own life. He\u2019s not a violent bully. He\u2019s a protector.</p><p>For some reason, even though I should\u2019ve seen it before, this knowledge slams into my chest and leaves me dumbfounded. The idea that I need a protector makes me feel weak. But the idea that I just had a protector makes me feel strong.</p> <p>Invincible.</p><p>I only savor the feeling for a minute before I shake it away. Needing someone like that makes you weak. You can\u2019t count on other people to be there. You can only count on yourself.</p><p>Myself.</p><p>Ethan walks into my periphery again and I shove my annoyance with him away. Now isn\u2019t the time. I don\u2019t know why I ever thought, even for a minute, that he and I could work.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says hesitantly, staring from Gabriel to me. I can see that he\u2019s very uncomfortable standing next to Gabriel, but he doesn\u2019t address it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. A patient is fully dilated and ready to deliver. Can we get a rain check on breakfast?\u201d</p><p>I nod quickly, almost relieved. I almost feel guilty for being pissed that he didn\u2019t step up, but I don\u2019t. He stood over there looking on even after he hung up his phone. He could definitely have done something then.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Because he\u2019s a candy-ass.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>I stand still, waiting for him to leave, and he looks at me uncertainly again.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I\u2019m your ride.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>In the heat of the moment I\u2019d forgotten. And Gabe\u2019s intoxicating nearness isn\u2019t helping either. I inhale his power and his strength with every breath I take. It\u2019s distracting.</p><p>I flush and take a step away from him. My foot doesn\u2019t seem to want to comply, but I force it.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say sheepishly. \u201cI came with you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe smiles, like he knows exactly why I\u2019m distracted. Like he can see the comparison I\u2019ve been drawing between him and Ethan. Like he can see how much he wins that comparison.</p><p>\u201cI can take you,\u201d he offers. \u201cI mean, if the doctor has an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Ethan looks uncertain for a split second, then nods. \u201cThat would be great. I really should go. Maddy?\u201d</p><p>Ethan looks at me, expecting me to agree. And there\u2019s really nothing else I can do, not without seeming like an utter bitch.</p><p>But the idea of Gabe and me... sitting within the small confines of a car again. The mere thought almost makes me twitch, because all I can do is think of the last time.</p><p>When Gabe licked his fingers clean.</p><p>Warmth spreads into my panties.</p><p>I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s dark gaze is on me, potent and powerful, and I swear to God he\u2019s remembering too. His lip actually twitches, trying to fight off a smile.</p><p>The man can affect me without saying a word, especially now that I\u2019ve decided I was wrong about him. I was so, so wrong.</p><p>He\u2019s a protector.</p><p>That makes it even harder to fight off this attraction.</p><p>You don\u2019t need protecting anymore, I remind myself. You\u2019re all grown up\u2014strong and independent. No one can hurt you now. But that doesn\u2019t matter. None of that matters. All that matters is how Gabriel is making me feel right now.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>My fingers tremble so I clench them into fists. He makes me self-conscious, like he can see right into my thoughts.</p><p>I swallow hard and try to act nonchalant, as though he doesn\u2019t affect me at all.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine,\u201d I finally manage to say. \u201cThank you, Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give you a ride anytime,\u201d he answers and I look at him sharply. His double entendre hasn\u2019t been missed. At least not by me. Ethan is oblivious.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ethan tells Gabriel grudgingly. He starts to walk away, then calls over his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll call you soon, Maddy.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even answer.</p><p>Gabe looks at me, amusement in his dark eyes. \u201cWhat the hell do you see in that guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... er...\u201d and then I can\u2019t help but dissolve into a giggle.</p><p>The memory of Ethan standing helplessly to the side, watching while Jared puffed out his chest like a rooster, suddenly makes me laugh. I\u2019m no longer even mad about it. It\u2019s just so ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I finally manage. \u201cHe\u2019s been a friend for a long time. He was probably just afraid. Fighting isn\u2019t really his thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a candy-ass,\u201d Gabriel answers simply. \u201cFear is a choice.\u201d</p><p>What an interesting thing to say. I\u2019m sure that, for him, fear is a choice. It\u2019s how he\u2019s been trained. He\u2019s hard and strong and he\u2019s not afraid of anything.</p><p>Except for one thing. The thing that brought him to his knees that night in Chicago.</p><p>His secret.</p><p>We walk to his car and I slide into the passenger seat, clicking my seat belt. I don\u2019t know what it is about guys and hot rods, and I\u2019ll probably never understand it.</p><p>As Gabe pulls out of the parking lot, he glances at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your parents.\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cYou overheard that?\u201d I ask, not looking him in the eye. I hate talking about this with people. I hate the sympathy in their eyes and trying to figure out what to do with it.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was standing right behind you.\u201d But then he drops it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s just not interested enough to ask questions or whether he\u2019s uncomfortable talking about stuff like that, but either way I\u2019m grateful. If I never talk about my parents dying again, that would be just fine with me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Jared saying about my sister?\u201d Gabe asks as he turns onto the main road. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cHe said she was lying about him and wanted me to tell her to stop. I have no clue what he was talking about.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looks thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. But he ran like the pussy he is. You know, he grabbed you. I\u2019m sure the gas station probably has a surveillance camera. You could press charges if you want to. Teach the little shit a lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d I answer. \u201cI keep thinking that he\u2019ll get tired of messing with Jacey, that he\u2019ll just go away, but he hasn\u2019t so far. Maybe we really should call the police. On the other hand, if I do, that might really piss him off and he\u2019ll never stop. I grew up with him. He\u2019s always gonna be an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be intimidated by him,\u201d Gabriel says firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here, so that he can\u2019t shove you guys around. He\u2019s a schoolyard bully that needs to grow up. But don\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly. \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject. I\u2019ve had enough of Jared for the day.\u201d</p><p>Gabe finally smiles, a slow smile that spreads along his lips.</p><p>\u201cOK. First you can tell me which way to turn, then you can tell me the real reason you\u2019re fucking around with doctor boy.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cLeft. And I told you the real reason. He\u2019s been a friend for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s the one rolling his eyes now.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s just your friend,\u201d Gabe points out as he turns down my road. \u201cYou should put him out of his misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I do that?\u201d I demand. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Gabriel concedes. \u201cBut I know what you want. You want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, geez. Are we back to that?\u201d I shake my head, but his words cause a rush of warmth to spread through me. I do want him, asshole cockiness and all.</p><p>\u201cJacey thinks you should date me,\u201d Gabriel announces as he turns into my drive.</p><p>I put my hand on the car handle. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to date me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou want to fuck me. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cTomato, tomahto.\u201d</p><p>A thrill shoots through me and I can\u2019t help but smile as I open the door.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I rarely do what your sister suggests. She\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Gabriel agrees. \u201cAbout most things. The verdict is still out on this particular thing, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I ask, my eyebrow cocked.</p><p>\u201cYup. Maybe we should do a little research. You know, just to see. Let\u2019s have dinner on Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>And with that, just like that, the game is back on.</p><p>He stares at me, waiting for me to accept.</p><p>Do you want to play? Yes or no?</p><p>He apparently thinks there\u2019s no way I would decline. I have to avoid looking at his totally cut body so that I can. I have to put the image of him standing up for me out of my mind.</p><p>Because there\u2019s something about him that I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Something secret.</p><p>Something that made him freak the fuck out, turning this strong protector into a violent incoherent guy who has panic attacks and punches walls. And I have no idea what that something is.</p><p>I shake my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cocky,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSo fricking cocky. I would\u2019ve thought that you would be too busy with your other dates. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I can\u2019t on Saturday. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>I have no plans whatsoever, but he doesn\u2019t need to know that. If he can throw his dates in my face, I can throw mine in his. Even if mine are imaginary.</p><p>Gabriel looks stunned and then realization clouds his face as he remembers that he told me he had a date last night. He starts to say something, but I cut him off as I spin around and head for my house. With every step I feel his dark gaze hitting me between the shoulder blades.</p><p>I ignore it.</p> <p>But one thing I can\u2019t ignore is that everything about that man makes my knees weak. I can\u2019t ignore the look in his eyes: that dark, dark look that says, Don\u2019t worry. No one will hurt you on my watch. I can\u2019t ignore the way one look from him sets my blood on fire.</p><p>And I can\u2019t ignore the biggest thing of all, the heavy question that sits on my chest all the time, even though I\u2019ve only just acknowledged it.</p><p>I know he has a secret that has the ability to turn him into everything that I\u2019m afraid of.</p><p>The question is, are all the good things I know about him enough to make me see past it?</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Work seems particularly monotonous today. I\u2019ve placed next month\u2019s food order, drunk four cups of coffee, and I have a caffeine buzz when I follow up with Jacey and make sure that she\u2019s up in time to come to work.</p><p>She\u2019s made a habit lately of coming home from the clubs in the early-morning hours, then oversleeping for work. That was one thing when we were teenagers, but we\u2019re not kids anymore. It\u2019s time to grow up.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jacey sighs into the phone. \u201cI\u2019m up. I\u2019m showered. I\u2019ll be there shortly. You didn\u2019t need to check on me. And what did you do to my brother this morning? He said he gave you a ride, but he was mean as hell when he came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just told him I couldn\u2019t go out with him on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Jacey grumbles. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just hook up already? You know you both want to and you\u2019ll both be happier when you do.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s right, but I don\u2019t say that.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll have your paycheck ready when you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019K. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I stare forlornly at the papers balanced precariously in stacks on my desk. I decide to take a quick break and run out to the dining room to stretch my legs. As I enter, Tony calls for me from the bar.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maddy. Your sister just called and wanted to know if you\u2019d bring her out some soup on your way home. Pax is in Hartford for a week and she\u2019s not feeling that well today. She really didn\u2019t sound good. Maybe you should take it to her right now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m instantly concerned. Mila isn\u2019t one to complain, not ever. She could be on her deathbed and she wouldn\u2019t whine.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I ask Tony as I lean against the bar. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her, did she say? Is it morning sickness still or something else?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his giant head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say. She just said she feels sicker than usual and that she\u2019s going to stay in bed today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThat\u2019s not like her. I hope she doesn\u2019t have the flu. If you box something up I\u2019ll run it out to her right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d Tony grins, handing me a large carryout sack. \u201cThere are saltines in there too. They might settle her stomach.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not a problem to make a food run to my sister. Her house is only a few minutes away, perched on the edge of the bluffs by the lake. It was Pax\u2019s before they got married and it\u2019s a gorgeous home.</p><p>I knock on the door and when Mila finally answers it I\u2019m even more concerned. Her face has a grayish pallor to it, her normally bright eyes dull, and she\u2019s still in her nightgown.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I exclaim as I follow her into the house. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Is your morning sickness worse? That\u2019s not normal, right? Shouldn\u2019t you be over that by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she groans. \u201cI had the worst stomachache last night, so I was up all night long. I barely slept.\u201d</p><p>I gently push her onto a barstool and begin unloading her lunch. \u201cWhen did Pax leave?\u201d</p><p>Mila drops her head onto her crossed arms. \u201cYesterday. Don\u2019t tell him that I\u2019m sick or he\u2019ll come straight home. He\u2019s got meetings with his grandpa this week.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her uncertainly. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mi. You look pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I don\u2019t want him to come home, Madison. Have a heart. It\u2019s just a stomach bug. He doesn\u2019t need to be here, listening to me every time I\u2019m in the bathroom. Seriously. How embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cFine. I won\u2019t call him yet. But you\u2019ve got to promise to get some rest. Is there anything else I can bring you?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cNope. I\u2019m just going to finish eating this and then curl up and sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit with you for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Mila manages a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re as overprotective as Pax is.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother to answer, because I know she\u2019s right.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s life?\u201d she asks quietly in between bites. \u201cHow was your date with Ethan?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the last time I listen to your advice about my love life. It was dry, boring, vanilla... all the things that Ethan is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww. Poor Ethan,\u201d Mila answers sympathetically. \u201cHe can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I answer ruefully. And I do.</p><p>\u201cThis soup is good,\u201d Mila says, blowing on another spoonful as she changes the subject. \u201cCan you tell Tony thank you for me?\u201d</p><p>Mila sticks another bite in her mouth and, as she does, I hear the muted buzz of my cell phone in my purse. I slide it out and am startled to see the text message it displays.</p><p>This is Gabriel. I have to tell you something.</p><p>The mere sight of his name on my phone causes my pulse to race and I stare at it. This catches Mila\u2019s attention and she pauses, watching me, interested now.</p><p>I answer, How did you get my number? Let\u2019s start with that.</p><p>I grin and Mila raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I tell her. She rolls her eyes but returns to her soup, her forehead in her hand.</p><p>My phone buzzes.</p><p>From Jacey, obviously.</p><p>I answer, Jacey talks a lot.</p><p>It takes him one second to reply, Hell yes, she does.</p><p>I feel a little breathless as I type, What did you need to tell me?</p><p>There is a moment, and then, My date the other night was with Brand.</p><p>The amount of relief that floods my body as I read those words is incredible. I feel lighter than I have for days. But I can\u2019t tell him that. Instead I say Is that supposed to matter to me?</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s cockiness knows no bounds, because he answers without hesitation.</p><p>It matters to you.</p><p>I smile a little, because it does. But before I can answer, he sends a second text.</p><p>And it matters to me that I misled you about it. I\u2019m sorry about that.</p><p>I pause, astonished by his apology. He doesn\u2019t seem like someone who would readily apologize. He\u2019s too self-assured, too commanding, like my father. And one thing I learned from my father is that people like him don\u2019t apologize often.</p><p>Even still, Gabriel did.</p><p>If I concentrate hard enough, I can almost hear Gabe\u2019s husky voice saying the words. It sends warmth gushing through me and I see flashes of him in my head... escorting Jared out of the Hill, stepping in when Jared grabbed me at the gas station.</p><p>In actuality, my father was more like Jared. And Gabriel is nothing like that. Is it possible that I misjudged him on every level?</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s nothing like my father at all.</p><p>The thought sends a knot into my throat as I answer his text.</p><p>It\u2019s okay.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s okay, I just know that all of a sudden, it is.</p><p>And then he says something that sends my heart into my throat.</p><p>Just so you know, the next date I go on will be with you.</p><p>I stare at the words, unable to keep from smiling, even as my fingers shake. Mila stares at me once again, her curiosity apparent.</p><p>So you\u2019re threatening me now? I answer, and I have to giggle just a little.</p><p>This game I\u2019m playing with him is the most fun I\u2019ve had in a while. Mila grows annoyed with my lack of explanation and rolls her eyes, muttering something about how stubborn I am. And then Gabriel\u2019s answering text comes through.</p><p>No, it\u2019s a promise.</p><p>I know we\u2019re just bantering back and forth, but those four words make my legs tremble. Gabriel is so strong, so assured. So secure. He makes me feel like I can depend on him. It\u2019s a thought that I know will freak me out later when I can really think about it.</p><p>Well, we DO have something we need to finish, I quickly type before I can talk myself out of it.</p><p>A thrill rushes through me as I slip my phone back into my purse and turn to Mila\u2019s waiting gaze.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was?\u201d She lifts an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d I sigh. \u201cJacey\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know who Gabriel is,\u201d Mila laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>So I tell her just a little, how an entire date with Ethan can leave me cold, but one single glance from Gabriel can set my blood on fire. One stupid text can leave me weak-kneed.</p><p>As sick as Mila looks, she laughs again.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You have no idea how happy this makes me. Don\u2019t look so miserable, Mad. This is awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why does it feel so scary?\u201d I grumble.</p><p>Mila nods sagely. \u201cBecause it is scary. When I was first with Pax, I was terrified. I mean, he was so messed up, but I still loved him. He\u2019s who I\u2019m meant to be with. And look how it all turned out, look how happy we are now. It was all worth it. I know that Gabriel has some baggage. I can see it on him. And I\u2019m sure you can see it on him. But whatever Gabriel\u2019s stuff is, I\u2019m sure you can work through it. And it will be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I raise an eyebrow and my sister nods again.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I answer firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wind up curled up on my bed crying about him when he loses his temper with me one too many times. I\u2019m never going to be Mom, Mila.\u201d</p><p>Mila looks away, at the wall, at the floor. I know that she doesn\u2019t remember nearly as much stuff as I do about our parents\u2019 problems. If Mom was crying, I took Mila outside to play. If Mom and Dad were screaming, I\u2019d take Mila to the beach. She didn\u2019t see as much as I did, even though she knows it happened.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she finally answers in a small voice. \u201cDad had some anger issues. But Gabriel isn\u2019t Dad. And you aren\u2019t Mom. Trust me, you should give Gabriel a chance. My gut is telling me that he\u2019d be good for you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at my sister, at her tired face, at her skinny arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sis. I\u2019ve been sitting here boring you with my drama and you need to go rest. You really do look awful. Come on, let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>I reach to help her from her stool, but she pauses, a strange look on her face.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d she mumbles, her hand falling to her abdomen, pressing tightly. I\u2019m startled as I stare at her stricken face.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask anxiously.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answers quietly. \u201cI\u2019m crampy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s crampy? I sit still, frozen, as she rubs her belly. Then, as she slides from her stool, she\u2019s the one who stands frozen, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask nervously.</p><p>And then I see it. Blood drips in a crimson stream down one of her bare legs and onto the floor. I gasp and grab her, pulling her into a chair, making her sit.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK? Are you in pain?\u201d</p> <p>I flutter around like a crazy person, not sure what to do. Mila is calmer than I am as she sits hunched over in the chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get some clothes on, then can you drive me to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>I nod, then run up the stairs to her room, taking them two at a time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab your clothes,\u201d I call over my shoulder. \u201cYou stay right there. Maybe you should call your doctor.\u201d</p><p>I can hear her speaking on the phone as I rifle through her drawers and find a pair of yoga pants and a T-shirt. When I come running back down the stairs, she is hanging up the phone. Her face is grim and pale.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d I ask anxiously as I hand her the clothing.</p> <p>\u201cThey said to come straight in.\u201d</p><p>Mila inhales sharply and I grab her. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she murmurs as she pulls the clothes on. \u201cThe cramps just got worse. All of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>Even I know that this shouldn\u2019t be happening. Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be crampy. And there definitely shouldn\u2019t be blood involved.</p><p>I\u2019m beyond panicked now and I don\u2019t know what to do. Now I know how Pax feels, because if I could carry Mila out to the car, I so would.</p><p>Pax.</p><p>\u201cI should call Pax,\u201d I tell her quickly, in relief. Pax will know what to do.</p><p>But Mila immediately shakes her head.</p> <p>\u201cIt might be nothing,\u201d she says quickly. \u201cLet\u2019s just wait until we know. I don\u2019t want to worry him.\u201d</p><p>But her face gives her away.</p><p>She\u2019s terrified and she thinks something is really wrong. I gulp as I get her settled into the front seat of my car and then I practically break land-speed records getting her to the doctor. I gulp again when I help her out of the car and see the blood smeared on the seat.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>To the doctor\u2019s credit, she gets Mila right in without a wait at all. I help Mila change into the horrible paper gown, then hold her hand as the doctor does a sonogram.</p><p>\u201cMmmhmmm,\u201d Dr. Hall muses as she runs the ball of the sonogram wand over my sister\u2019s belly, to and fro. \u201cMmmhmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mila asks anxiously, her green eyes wide and scared. \u201cDo you see anything? Is there a heartbeat?\u201d</p><p>The doctor looks up at her. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a heartbeat,\u201d she assures her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s strong. What I am seeing, though, is cause for concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Mila breathes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Her fingers clutch mine a little tighter.</p><p>The doctor stares at the computer screen and then points to a round, dark mass just to the side of the fetus. \u201cSee that area right there? That black area?\u201d Mila and I both nod.</p><p>\u201cThat is what\u2019s called a subchorionic hemorrhage. In plain English, it\u2019s a blood pool that is forming between the placenta and your uterine wall. Sometimes it\u2019s a result of a serious injury, but more often than not it just happens. We don\u2019t know the cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Mila whispers. \u201cIs the baby going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s face is serious. \u201cIt means that if the blood pool continues to grow, it could cause your placenta to break away from the uterus, in what is called placental abruption. That could be fatal for your baby and life-threatening for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I can\u2019t help but gasp. It comes out before I even think about it. Mila swallows hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it were a small pool of blood, I wouldn\u2019t be so worried, but it\u2019s fairly substantial already. We need to keep it stabilized and prevent it from growing. The best way we can do that is to keep you off your feet. You\u2019re going to require complete bed rest. You can only get up to go to the bathroom. No sex, no walking, limited movement.\u201d</p><p>The doctor pauses, allowing that to sink in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the prognosis?\u201d I manage to ask.</p><p>\u201cGood question. I\u2019d say from the size of this bleed that Mila has a fifty to sixty percent chance of preterm labor. The real risk with this situation, though, is hemorrhage. It happens so suddenly that it\u2019s hard to control, which makes it dangerous. So, Mila, I\u2019m going to put you in the hospital overnight, so that I can give you some fluids. You\u2019re dehydrated. And then after that, complete bed rest at home and we\u2019ll hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>Mila nods, the shock apparent on her pale face.</p><p>I feel her hand get even colder as I clutch it within mine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, Mila. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>I glare at the doctor, all but daring her to say otherwise. It\u2019s irrational, I know. It\u2019s not Dr. Hall\u2019s fault at all, but I\u2019m annoyed at her matter-of-fact manner. This is my sister we\u2019re talking about, and she needs reassurance.</p><p>After the doctor leaves, with instructions for us to go straight to the hospital, I help Mila to her feet and then help her get her clothes on. I look into her face.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Mila. Everything will be fine. I\u2019m going to call Pax as soon as we get you settled into the hospital and I know he\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><p>She nods now, not arguing. Her limp acceptance of this situation rips my heart out. My little sister has been my responsibility for years now and knowing that I can\u2019t protect her from this is too terrible to bear.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d I insist once again as I bundle her into my car. She leans her face on the car window and doesn\u2019t reply. I swallow a lump in my throat as I start the car and head for the hospital. This can\u2019t be happening. Mila and Pax almost lost each other a couple of times this past year. They can\u2019t lose their baby too.</p><p>When we arrive at the hospital, a nurse brings out a wheelchair and they wheel Mila on up while I fill out her paperwork and call Pax. He answers on the second ring, probably concerned when he sees my number. I never call him when he\u2019s out of town.</p><p>\u201cMadison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Pax. There\u2019s a problem. You need to come home.\u201d</p><p>I quickly fill him in and he practically hangs up on me in his haste to make arrangements to fly home. He texts me ten minutes later.</p><p>I\u2019m taking the company jet. I\u2019ll be there in three hours. Tell Mila I\u2019m coming.</p><p>The lump forms in my throat again, but I swallow it as I head upstairs to Mila\u2019s room. When I arrive I find her attached to all kinds of wires and monitors, and she has an IV stuck in her arm. She seems so small amid all the tubes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I tell her softly as I walk in. Her big green eyes stare at me.</p><p>\u201cHey. Thanks for calling Pax,\u201d she tells me quietly. \u201cHe texted that he\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is,\u201d I tell her. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be anywhere other than here, I can tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Mila answers, closing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sleepy. I\u2019m going to take a nap while I wait, OK?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll sit right here until Pax arrives.\u201d</p><p>Mila nods without opening her eyes and I pick up her hand. It\u2019s freezing cold, so I pull her blankets up a little tighter and then settle into the chair next to her.</p><p>I watch her sleep for a while, holding her hand tight. Her breathing is rhythmic, her chest moving slowly up and down as she takes little peaceful breaths. She seems calm in sleep and I\u2019m glad. She deserves a break from reality right now.</p><p>After a while, when I feel pretty sure that she isn\u2019t going to wake up anytime soon, I rush down to the gift shop and grab some magazines. On my way back, while I wait for the elevator, I glance to the side and notice a tiny family huddled together in the ER waiting room. A dad, a mom, a son.</p><p>They are sitting hunched together like they are facing the world together, each face streaked with tears. I stare at them for a minute, unable to look away, until the mom looks up at me and meets my gaze. There is such utter pain in her eyes that it makes my heart hurt. Something horrible has happened to them and I know that feeling.</p><p>Unbidden, memories from the day my parents died come back to me, flooding through me as I stand limply in front of the steel doors of the elevator.</p><p>Mila\u2019s phone call, her sobbing voice.</p><p>Me, standing in New York City as my world crashed down.</p><p>Flying home.</p><p>Picking out caskets.</p><p>Choosing flowers.</p><p>Hymns.</p><p>Verses.</p><p>The overwhelming grief that made it so hard to function, so hard to even swallow or breathe.</p><p>The guilt.</p><p>The guilt.</p><p>The guilt.</p><p>Knowing that I hated my father for hurting my mother, but still loving him anyway.</p><p>Feeling like I was abandoning my mother for loving him, but then remembering that she loved him too. Passionately and completely.</p><p>Which is why she stayed.</p><p>That day, that one day, changed me forever. It taught me that everything you love, everyone you love, even if you love them and hate them at the same time, can be taken away in a moment and there isn\u2019t anything you can do to change it.</p><p>It made me helpless. Powerless. And I hate that feeling with every ounce of my being.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>A hesitant voice breaks into my thoughts and I look up, startled, to find a woman holding the elevator for me.</p><p>\u201cDo you need to go up?\u201d she asks, her kind eyes flitting over my face. I nod, unable to speak because somehow that fucking lump is back in my throat. The same lump that was there when we buried my parents.</p><p>I step quickly into the elevator, leaning against the back wall as I try to breathe deep, to swallow.</p><p>Mila\u2019s not going to die. I\u2019m completely overreacting. Yet I can\u2019t stop my feet from practically flying down the hall to get to her, to make sure she\u2019s all right, to make sure something catastrophic didn\u2019t happen to her while I was gone.</p><p>Because I left her. I left her back then when I moved to New York and I left her now.</p><p>But when I throw open the door, she\u2019s still sleeping peacefully, curled on her side, her hand cupped to her face.</p><p>My stomach tightens. I can\u2019t lose Mila. She\u2019s been through too much not to have a happy ending. And if I lost her now, I don\u2019t know what it would do to me.</p><p>I know that much is true.</p><p>I collapse into the chair next to her and drop the magazines onto the floor. I\u2019m content to sit here and stew in my worry.</p><p>Minutes turn into hours and before I know it, Pax bursts into the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance at the clock. It\u2019s barely eight p.m. He\u2019s thirty minutes early. I have no idea how he managed to make it so fast, considering he had to drive from the airport in Chicago to Angel Bay. He must\u2019ve broken some land-speed records of his own.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asks worriedly as he pulls up the chair on the other side of the bed. \u201cI got here as fast as I could.\u201d His handsome face is ashen as he takes in the full picture of his wife, small and pale in the bed. \u201cOh my God. I can\u2019t believe this. What did the doctor say? What caused this?\u201d</p><p>I explain what the doctor said, and with every word Pax\u2019s face gets paler and paler.</p><p>\u201cThis could actually threaten her life?\u201d he finally whispers.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cIf the placenta ruptures from the side of her uterus, yes. That\u2019s why she\u2019s got to stay in bed. The more she stands up, the more the force of gravity will pull on the weight of her uterus and could cause the abruption. She\u2019s got to have complete rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Pax says firmly. \u201cShe won\u2019t be moving. Not until the baby is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long couple months,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut between us, we\u2019ve got to keep her still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we have to tie her down, we will,\u201d he says. At his words, Mila opens her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d she says softly, smiling at her husband. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in bed. And everything will be OK. Madison already promised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, because Madison\u2019s in control of that?\u201d Pax smiles back at his wife, bending to kiss her forehead.</p><p>My stomach tightens again at their obvious tenderness for each other. It\u2019s practically palpable. I\u2019ve never seen anyone love each other as much as they do, and while I\u2019m happy for Mila, it makes me feel so very alone.</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019d never let anything hurt me.\u201d Mila nods, grinning. \u201cSeriously, I have faith. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Pax agrees. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. And the baby is too.\u201d</p><p>They curl up together with Pax half on the bed and half on his chair, his arms encircling Mila as if to protect her from the world.</p><p>Pax is a protector. Mila\u2019s protector.</p> <p>It\u2019s a sight that causes that freaking lump to immediately form back in my throat, both because it\u2019s heartwarming and because I\u2019d like to have what they have... a pure and perfect love for each other.</p><p>And someone to protect me from everything that might hurt me.</p><p>Someone like Gabe.</p><p>Oh my God. I\u2019ve got to get out of here before I embarrass myself.</p><p>I stand up and they both look up at me, their cheeks pink and warm from being cuddled together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head home and shower since Pax is here now. I want to wash off the hospital smell. If you guys need anything, just give me a call. I\u2019ll come out to the house tomorrow to check on you, Mi.\u201d I bend down and kiss her cheek. \u201cI love you. You\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she tells me confidently. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>I walk through the hospital woodenly as all my emotions come down on me, the fear that Mila could lose her baby, the worry for Mila herself... and the overwhelming loneliness that encompasses me right now.</p> <p>I don\u2019t even realize until I\u2019ve reached my car that tears are streaming down my cheeks.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>My house has never seemed so empty or quiet.</p><p>And I have never been quite so alone.</p><p>Jacey is covering for me at the Hill because there was no way that I could\u2019ve left Mila to go to work. But now, as I sit all alone on my patio with a bottle of wine, I wish that Jacey were here with me instead. I\u2019m stuck here by myself, with only my worries for company.</p><p>They\u2019re bad freaking company.</p><p>I take a sip of wine and stare at the sky, watching the storm clouds roll in, heavy and dark.</p><p>I stare at my wineglass and remember when my mother bought it, and decide that I need to buy my own freaking glassware.</p><p>I stare at the sand behind the house, noticing the way it\u2019s packed down, hard and damp.</p><p>I glance back at my watch and find that\u2019s it\u2019s only been one minute since the last time I looked at it.</p><p>I\u2019m pathetic. I\u2019m sitting here wallowing in my fear and worry and misery and it\u2019s ridiculous. I can\u2019t keep doing this tonight.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m getting up to find something else to do to keep my mind occupied, my doorbell rings. For one split second, I\u2019m panicked that it is bad news about Mila. And then I realize that\u2019s stupid. If something happened, Pax would call. Not send someone.</p><p>I open the door and am startled to find Gabriel standing in front of me.</p><p>He\u2019s strikingly sexy in his ever-present snug T-shirt and I somehow feel a marked sense of relief just at the mere sight of him.</p><p>He grins at me, holding up a silver tube of my lipstick.</p><p>\u201cYou left this in my car. I figured it must\u2019ve rolled out of your purse. Since it\u2019s not really my color, I figured I should return it.\u201d</p><p>I reach for it and he deposits it in my hand, and when he does, the warmth of his hand transfers to my own. It\u2019s the touch I\u2019ve been thinking about for days: his strength, his power.</p><p>He smiles at me and I try to smile back, but I suddenly can\u2019t.</p><p>My stomach clenches and a tear runs down my cheek.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s face sobers up and his eyes are veiled as he looks at me, assessing me.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Gabe asks, concerned as he stares at me, as his eyes search for what is wrong. He takes a step toward me, then stops. \u201cAre you?\u201d he repeats hesitantly.</p><p>I stand limply in front of him, an empty shell, but I nod.</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe. I don\u2019t know. Would you like a glass of wine? I really don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d My eyes burn, but I manage to get the words out.</p><p>Gabe looks at me, his stormy eyes focused on my face.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he finally answers. He doesn\u2019t even say that he prefers beer and I know that he does.</p><p>He takes my arm as I lead him through the house to the terrace. His hand is gentle, and strong, and warm on my elbow. I revel in the feel of it, in the warmth of his fingers, and I hate the coldness when he pulls it away. But we\u2019re on the terrace now, so he steps back, watching me, hesitant.</p><p>He\u2019s waiting.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know what I want.</p><p>It\u2019s lightly raining now, but neither of us acknowledges it. I pour him a glass of wine and hand it to him with shaking fingers. I see the crimson liquid splash upward against the side of the glass, sliding back down into a pool. In my head I see the crimson blood running down Mila\u2019s legs and I cringe, squeezing my eyes shut, trying to block it out.</p><p>\u201cMaddy,\u201d he says uncertainly, his voice deep and husky. \u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I open my eyes and am distracted by the shape of his mouth, by the slant, by the full but firm lips. The lips I\u2019ve thought about for days. The lips that licked me from his fingers.</p><p>I swallow, then I lift my fingers and trace his lips, sliding my fingertips over the softness. He stands still, completely still, as he waits to see what I\u2019m going to do. As his dark eyes find mine, I decide that for this moment, I don\u2019t care what his issues are.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a game anymore, if it ever really was.</p><p>\u201cMaddy,\u201d he murmurs quietly, but firmer this time, his eyes frozen on mine even as he remains still. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a bad day. And I need you to make it good again.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me in shock. I can\u2019t blame him.</p><p>Confusion fills Gabriel\u2019s eyes as he stands there facing me, not sure of what to do.</p><p>So I show him.</p><p>Reaching up, I press my lips softly to his, tentative at first, enjoying the taste of salt that lingers there, loving the way his chest is so rock-solid beneath my fingers.</p><p>The kiss is so soft, so gentle; barely there. But the intensity of having wanted it for days makes it fierce. His lips ignite a fire that flashes through my mouth and down into my chest and buries itself between my legs.</p><p>It roars to life there, burning bright, the flames licking up into the rest of me.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s strong arms automatically close around me as I deepen the kiss, plunging my tongue desperately into his mouth, tangling with his. I glance up and his dark eyes are open, staring into mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re OK?\u201d he asks against my lips, almost desperately. I nod.</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>My voice is a whisper and he groans, kissing me again, pulling me closer.</p><p>My hands are everywhere, running over his hard chest, his chiseled waist, his toned backside. Our mouths are hot and wet and open, our breath panting.</p><p>The friction from his warm skin against my fingertips is delicious and for a minute I remember that night in the taxi, how his dark eyes burned for me then, how he licked his fingers. That mere memory turns my knees weak yet again, just like it does every time I think of it.</p><p>I grasp his hand and shove it between my legs, but my pants are in the way. I step out of them as I push my wet hair out of my face and he reaches down, ripping my panties away from my body... ridding us of the barrier between him and me.</p><p>He stands there, the shredding tatters of my underwear dangling from his fingers, then he flicks them away and they fall onto the wet ground at our feet.</p><p>I\u2019m throbbing now as I stand facing him, waiting for him to touch me, the heat between my legs almost more than I can take.</p><p>Every nerve ending waits for him.</p><p>I hold my breath.</p><p>The rain pours down.</p><p>And then he touches me. His fingers, so long, slide into me and suddenly I find myself balanced on the palm of his hand, like everything in my being is tied to him. Waiting for him.</p><p>It\u2019s been waiting for him forever.</p><p>He slips farther inside and everything in me moans. My eyes flicker up and catch his; his are hooded and dark as his eyelashes flutter down.</p><p>I run my fingers along his waistband.</p><p>\u201cIs this OK?\u201d I whisper, my lids lifting to meet his gaze, watching the rain run off his face.</p><p>\u201cHell, yes,\u201d he mutters, guiding my hand to his hard crotch. It strains against my hand, pulsing and hot, and need for him flows in me everywhere, hot and rough and impatient.</p><p>I know that I need him to put the fire out.</p><p>I shove his shorts down and discard them to the side. It doesn\u2019t matter to me that we\u2019re outdoors. Nothing matters now but this.</p><p>This heat, this need; this blur of colors and feelings. This explosion of things that I can\u2019t control, can\u2019t even name.</p><p>Gripping him in my hand, I slide him easily in my fingers, wet from the rain. He\u2019s as enormous as I remember, slick and hot and pulsing.</p><p>He\u2019s hard for me.</p><p>He wants me.</p><p>He groans again, grabbing my face and pulling me to him, crushing my lips with his own, hard and yet soft.</p><p>I nip at his neck, dragging my teeth along the curve of his shoulder, aching to have him fill me up already, but knowing that we should wait. I want to drag it out, to prolong this exquisite agony of waiting for it.</p><p>Of waiting for him.</p><p>He stands naked in front of me now, tall and proud, and he\u2019s so fucking beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Around us the rain pours down and the thunder rumbles, the electricity in the sky colliding with our energy. It\u2019s a heady combination and I drop to my knees, taking him into my mouth. He\u2019s huge and hard, and I move my lips up his length, letting him slide in past my teeth, down my throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Madison,\u201d Gabriel groans, his fingers buried in my hair, guiding my speed. \u201cGod, that feels so good.\u201d</p><p>I slide him in and out for a few minutes more, until he pushes me away, grabbing at my shirt and almost ripping it off. The raging heat from our bodies pressed together pools between my legs.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d I murmur to him. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to ask why you\u2019ve changed your mind,\u201d Gabriel says roughly, dipping his head to trail his lips along my neck. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter right now. I want to be inside you, Madison. I\u2019m finally going to fuck you and you\u2019re going to like it.\u201d</p><p>He pulls on my hand, urging me back toward the house, but I plant my heels.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I tell him simply. \u201cRight here, in the rain. I want you right now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looks sharply at me, but he doesn\u2019t argue. He simply eases me onto the large stone table behind us. It\u2019s cold and wet, but it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Nothing matters but this.</p> <p>His body covers mine, rubbing against every inch of me, bringing every nerve ending singing to life. He hovers above me now, just as I\u2019ve imagined him hovering above me, waiting to enter me.</p><p>Reality is even better than my imagination.</p><p>I grasp at his back as he slides his fingers into me again, my muscles flexing as he moves. Everything around us ceases to matter; the wind, the rain... it all fades away and all that I can see is him.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so wet,\u201d he rasps into my ear. \u201cAnd so fucking tight.\u201d</p><p>He fingers me softly, then harder. And then he withdraws his fingers. Before I can protest at his absence, I hear a wrapper crinkle and then he slips into me, hard and full.</p><p>I gasp, then hold on as he thrusts into me.</p> <p>I needed this so much.</p><p>I needed him and I didn\u2019t even realize it.</p><p>My legs wrap around him, pulling him to me, as close as he can possibly get.</p><p>Intimate feelings, strange and foreign feelings, threaten to overwhelm me as I clutch him to me, as I absorb his warmth, his vitality, his scent.</p><p>Everything about this moment is exactly what I need, even if I can\u2019t define what I\u2019m feeling, or why I\u2019m feeling it. All my sadness, all my worry, all my fear culminate and explode in this moment. It makes everything blurry, makes everything happen so fast. I just want to take and take and take... everything he has to give.</p><p>Gabriel reaches between us and, using his thumb, brings me to climax a scant moment later.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he tells me raggedly, still thrusting into me, filling me up. His strength is apparent as he moves against me, every muscle flexing with every movement.</p><p>He pulls my leg up and over his shoulder, deepening his penetration. I call out, scratching into him, holding tight; and then he shudders with his own release a minute later.</p> <p>He collapses onto me, holding me close as we recover.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he finally says, after a few minutes. \u201cThat was incredible.\u201d</p><p>My chest almost hurts from the feeling of completion that is filling it. I reach out and slide my fingers along Gabe\u2019s jawline, along the stubble that always lingers there and turns me on.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I agree. \u201cExcept for the rain. I didn\u2019t care about it a few minutes ago, but now...\u201d My voice trails off as my teeth start to chatter.</p><p>Gabriel sits up and then stands, pulling me to my feet. He hands me my clothes, then gets dressed himself.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he tells me, grabbing my hand and pulling me into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>\u201cTaking a hot shower. That rain is fucking cold.\u201d</p><p>We tumble through the door and I lead him to the bathroom, stopping only to let the shower water get hot. Gabriel turns to me and helps me into the shower, and then lathers up his hands, running them over my back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispers into my ear. \u201cYou have no idea how much I think about you.\u201d</p><p>He does? That thought makes my heart race.</p><p>Gabriel drops to his knees and lathers his hands again, paying close attention to my thighs, then to the crevices behind my knees. When his soapy hands slip to the apex of my thighs, I inhale sharply and watch him smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he asks knowingly. He rinses his hand, then slips a finger into me. I nod and another finger slips in. I squeeze my eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Maddy,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI want to see you when I do this.\u201d</p><p>The idea of being vulnerable right now while I\u2019m so exposed makes me nervous, but Gabe doesn\u2019t give me the time to think about it. He pushes me back onto the ledge of the shower, and then, while I watch, he detaches the shower nozzle. He rinses away the water, then holds the nozzle between my legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat... the... hell...\u201d I murmur in amazement as waves of pleasure ripple through me, buoying me up, teetering me on the edge of another orgasm.</p><p>I close my eyes again, allowing myself to give in to the pleasure, to the sinfully good sensations stemming from the water hitting me at just the right angle. I\u2019m self-conscious and nervous that Gabe is watching me, but it feels so freaking good that I can\u2019t help but to just let him do it. If I protested, he might stop. And there\u2019s no way I want that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, sweetheart,\u201d he murmurs into my neck. \u201cLet yourself go. Relax.\u201d</p><p>So I do. I just focus on the building waves of my orgasm. And just when I am grabbing at the shower wall, almost ready to come, Gabriel pulls the shower nozzle away and replaces it with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d I practically scream, as I shudder against him. My legs go weak with the strength of my orgasm and I hold tight to Gabriel so my knees don\u2019t give out.</p><p>His face is clouded, his eyes slightly unfocused as he pulls me up and flips me over. I see him reach for his wallet and there is another rustle of foil. Then without another word he slips inside me from behind, thrusting harder and harder.</p><p>Even though I already came once, the sensations start building again. He wraps his hand around and moves his fingers against me too. I moan, my hands slipping down the wet wall in front of me, my cheek resting against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYour ass is amazing,\u201d Gabriel murmurs, his lips resting against my shoulders. \u201cTell me what you want, Madison. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>I breathe in, then breathe out, slowing down the moment.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come,\u201d I finally tell him, loving how he fills me up. \u201cI want to know you like it.\u201d</p><p>He groans as he thrusts again. \u201cOh, trust me. I fucking love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo come then,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShow me how much you love it. I want to feel it.\u201d</p><p>He moves his hands to my hips now, clutching tightly there, his fingers digging into my skin as he moves. Rhythmically, he moves with me until he finally sucks in a breath and pulses into me. I can feel the heat spreading into the condom and I close my eyes, enjoying it.</p><p>We stay that way with the water beating down on us for several minutes, before Gabriel straightens up and rinses us off. We step out of the shower and as I\u2019m drying off, Gabriel looks at me.</p><p>\u201cI could use some coffee. Can I go make some?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOf course. The kitchen is... well, you know where it is. We came in through the kitchen door.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ducks out and I join him in the kitchen after I\u2019ve gotten dressed. He\u2019s still shirtless, maneuvering about the kitchen with ease. The smell of coffee percolating is already filling the air and I watch as Gabriel finds two cups, filling them both. He sips at one, then dumps sugar and cream in the other, simply assuming that I want it. And he\u2019s right. That\u2019s exactly how I take it.</p><p>He sets a cup in front of me and then sits down across from me at the table.</p><p>The air between us has cleared, the frenzied sexual tension is gone. The need, however, remains... only it\u2019s quiet now, latent.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Gabe stares at me. \u201cAre you going to tell me what that was all about?\u201d</p><p>I think about my poor sister, huddled in her bed back at the hospital. I think about the possibility that I could lose her. I think about the fact that I\u2019m always afraid and the only time I\u2019ve not been afraid in as long as I remember was a few minutes ago when I was wrapped in his arms. I think of all of that.</p><p>As I do, my eyes well up again, against my will. I hate to cry. And I\u2019ve never been a crier. Until today, apparently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had a bad day,\u201d I manage to say without crying. But my throat is hot and tight, and I know that if I keep talking, I\u2019m going to lose it.</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d Gabriel replies drily, thoughtfully. \u201cAnd did I manage to make it better?\u201d</p><p>I give him a weak smile and then sip at my coffee. I don\u2019t answer because I think he already knows.</p><p>\u201cIs this decaf?\u201d I ask instead.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t know if it\u2019d be hard for you to sleep otherwise.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s surprisingly thoughtful, something that just closes my throat up even more.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I utter, before a tear escapes.</p><p>Gabriel looks at me in alarm. \u201cMadison, I swear to God. Just tell me what is wrong. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and stare at my hands, then slowly look back up at him. Where should I begin? I decide to start with the only thing I can easily explain.</p><p>\u201cMy sister might lose her baby.\u201d The mere words are terrifying and they catch in my throat. \u201cAnd if she\u2019s not careful, she could die, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Gabriel mutters.</p><p>I nod shakily. \u201cShe and Pax have been through so much and now they have this to deal with. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looks at me seriously, his eyes softening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you all the bullshit about life not being fair. I\u2019m sure you know that already. What I will say is that I\u2019m sure your sister will be OK. She\u2019s strong and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll do whatever the doctors tell her to do.\u201d</p><p>I nod limply. \u201cShe will. It\u2019s just... you don\u2019t understand. Our parents died when she was a senior in college. I had just graduated. All of a sudden, it was just the two of us and it was so hard. I grew up in a hurry. I had to be the rock in our little family. Everything was always all right because I made it that way... but I can\u2019t fix this for her. It\u2019s out of my hands and I hate it.\u201d</p><p>My vision blurs as my eyes well up with hot tears, and one drips onto my thumb.</p><p>Gabriel reaches across the table and wipes my thumb off before enclosing my hand within his. His is large and rough and I imagine it got that way from his being a soldier.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK to cry,\u201d he tells me. \u201cEven the strongest do it.\u201d</p><p>I break down at his words, at the soft expression on his hardened face. My head drops to the table and I weep uncontrollably.</p><p>At some point Gabriel rounds the table and kneels in front of me, pulling me against his chest. His strong hands pat my back and stroke my arms and I cry until there\u2019s nothing left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can hear him speaking to me, telling me that I can\u2019t fix everything all the time, that I\u2019m just a person like anyone else. But his words don\u2019t even matter.</p><p>It\u2019s his voice that gives me comfort; his calm, husky, soothing voice. I wish I could wrap myself up in it and stay that way forever.</p><p>But even his voice can\u2019t stop my endless flow of tears.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m only crying for Mila\u2019s current situation, or if I\u2019m crying for everything that\u2019s happened in the past couple of years, for everything that I haven\u2019t allowed myself to cry for. Even at our parents\u2019 funeral I only cried once. I wanted to be the strong one, the one Mila could lean on. It feels so effing good to let it all go now.</p> <p>I feel utterly drained when I finally look up at Gabe.</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me cry on you,\u201d I tell him weakly. I\u2019m embarrassed, but he smiles.</p><p>\u201cJacey tells me that sometimes a woman just needs a good cry.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cNow, I should also admit that she cries at the drop of a hat, say if her coffee isn\u2019t hot enough. But still, it makes sense. Crying is cleansing. You should try it more often.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but I do feel remarkably cleansed, not that I\u2019d ever admit it. I\u2019m a strong person. I\u2019ve always prided myself on that strength. I\u2019m not about to become weak now. I lean my face against Gabriel\u2019s chest again.</p><p>I stare at the wall, at the shadows that move there, and I know that I just don\u2019t want to be alone tonight. I don\u2019t want Gabriel to leave. He\u2019s so very strong and I just want to absorb all that strength, to replenish my own.</p> <p>The thought of him leaving me after the emotional mess I\u2019ve been tonight... it makes me feel panicky inside, deep inside a place where I\u2019ve never looked.</p><p>\u201cI know this seems sudden and clingy,\u201d I mumble against his warm skin, \u201cBut can you stay? I want to sleep next to you tonight. I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel tenses up, his muscles coiled against me. Staying with me is obviously something that he doesn\u2019t want to do. My breath catches in my throat and heat burns up my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I say quickly, pushing away from him. \u201cThat was stupid. You don\u2019t need to stay.\u201d</p><p>He gazes at me and brushes a piece of my hair away from my face. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s just... there\u2019s shit you don\u2019t know about me. I can\u2019t stay. But I\u2019ll stay until you go to sleep. How about that?\u201d</p><p>I find myself nodding when my pride really wants to tell him to just go if he doesn\u2019t want to be here. But something in his face, something vulnerable in his eyes, makes me really hear what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s not rejecting me. It\u2019s something deeper than that.</p> <p>There\u2019s shit you don\u2019t know about me.</p><p>After we turn off the lights in the kitchen and climb under the covers of my bed, I turn and snuggle into Gabriel\u2019s chest, enjoying the way his arms hold me close. I can hear the beat of his heart against my ear and the sound soothes me.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the shit I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say quietly. \u201cBecause I\u2019d like to know it.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel is quiet for a moment and just when I think that he must be trying to decide how to tell me, he declines.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I can tell from his firm tone that he means it. He\u2019s not going to talk about it. I can\u2019t even be mad about that because I can also hear something else in his voice... something hurt, something tired, something resigned. Something that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me.</p><p>Something secret.</p><p>It makes me wrap my arm tighter around his side, pulling him closer.</p> <p>\u201cIf you ever want to tell me, you can,\u201d I tell him quietly. \u201cI won\u2019t judge. I promise that I\u2019ll try not to even ask probing questions. I\u2019ll just listen.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve known all along that he has a secret, something that has the power to drop him to his knees. He thinks that it\u2019s a secret, anyway. But I\u2019ve seen it. I know how it affects him.</p><p>It\u2019s what caused the secret that I\u2019m afraid of. I\u2019m afraid of anything that can decimate a person like Gabriel.</p><p>I feel his lips moving against my hair.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Maddy. Maybe someday.\u201d</p><p>But don\u2019t count on it.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say that, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s thinking it. I would bet any amount of money that he\u2019s never planning on talking about it, that he\u2019s going to keep everything buried as far down as he can for as long as he can. I know that\u2019s dangerous. You can\u2019t do that with something so big. If you do, it will explode.</p><p>And then what will happen? If it affects him as violently as it does right now, what will happen when it explodes?</p><p>I close my eyes again. I can\u2019t answer that question. It\u2019s so important and so scary, but I don\u2019t have it in me to think about it tonight.</p><p>So instead I inhale him, enjoying his masculine smell. I know I\u2019ll never forget his scent now; it smells like the outdoors, like musk and cedar. Like everything strong and good in the world. It\u2019s delicious.</p><p>But I can\u2019t sleep. Even though I\u2019m warm and safe with Gabriel, I\u2019m restless and I know the reason why. Because I know that the second I fall asleep, he\u2019s going to leave.</p><p>\u201cIf you leave, I won\u2019t be able to sleep,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re just going to have to lie here together, both of us awake until morning.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles again, tightening his hold on me. \u201cSomehow, Maddy, I feel like you won\u2019t be a pleasant person to be around if you don\u2019t get any sleep.\u201d</p><p>I start to protest, but then can\u2019t even deny it.</p><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re right,\u201d I grumble. \u201cI\u2019m a bitch when I don\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought so,\u201d Gabriel answers smugly. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK. I like your bitchiness.\u201d</p><p>I jab him in the ribs and he laughs, while I snuggle back into the crook of his arm. I lie still for a minute, just savoring his nearness before I feel the need to share something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the person I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel startles, then his words are quiet. \u201cAnd what kind of person am I?\u201d</p><p>My answer is immediate. \u201cYou\u2019re someone who won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>I hope.</p><p>Gabriel is silent for a moment, then he exhales a ragged breath. \u201cI would never hurt you on purpose, Maddy. Did you think that I would?\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cI, um. I thought you were a different kind of person. I thought you were a bully and I seriously hate bullies.\u201d</p><p>Gabe lets that sink in. \u201cPax told me a little bit about your father. Is that why you hate bullies so much?\u201d</p><p>I freeze, my hand unmoving on Gabriel\u2019s chest. I can\u2019t believe that Pax would tell someone. I\u2019m not mad, just taken aback. It\u2019s not something any of us talk about.</p><p>I have a brief flash of my father\u2019s fist hovering above my mother\u2019s face, droplets of blood on her dress, and I force the taste of fear out of my mouth.</p><p>Even the memory of fear tastes bad.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cI loved my dad. But he had an anger problem.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s question is hesitant, yet his words are strong. He sounds pissed, but like he\u2019s reining it in. \u201cDid he ever hit you?\u201d</p><p>My heart squeezes in my chest and I don\u2019t want to answer. I don\u2019t want to admit it out loud, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to lie. Not to Gabe.</p><p>\u201cOnly once. But once was enough.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s enough that I close my eyes and stilt my words and it\u2019s very obvious that I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Gabe takes the hint and holds me closer, his strong arms incredibly gentle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t have to tell me about it. I\u2019m not like that, Maddy. I won\u2019t ever hit you. That\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>I relax now, letting my body soften against his.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him honestly. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about that. I was more worried that you would be controlling like him, violent when you\u2019re angry. I can\u2019t take that kind of man. But that\u2019s not you. I know that now.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t ask why I would think that and I\u2019m grateful. Because then I don\u2019t have to explain that I search for my father\u2019s traits in every man.</p><p>I don\u2019t have to explain how it makes me weak, how always being afraid of those traits gives me a vulnerability. A vulnerability that I don\u2019t want.</p><p>I close my eyes again, reveling in the comfort that Gabe brings me, surprised by it, actually. I never expected to find someone who affects me the way Gabriel does. It\u2019s like an unexpected gift.</p><p>Gabe seems tense though, his body stiff, and I figure it\u2019s because I scared the shit out of him by talking about my feelings... by sharing some of my past with him. I gently shake him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I tell him softly, teasingly. \u201cI\u2019m done talking about deep stuff. I just wanted you to know that I misjudged you and that I\u2019m sorry for it.\u201d</p><p>He relaxes, his hard body slumping against me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. Everyone judges people when they meet them. It\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>It only takes me a couple of seconds to respond to that.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think about me?\u201d</p><p>Gabe thinks about it for a minute. \u201cI thought you were drop-dead fucking gorgeous and I couldn\u2019t figure out why you wanted to go home with me. You didn\u2019t seem like the kind of girl for a one-night stand. But I thanked God for my good fortune anyway.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m OK with that answer. It\u2019s not deep, but it\u2019s such a man answer. At least he\u2019s honest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of girl for a one-night stand,\u201d I admit. \u201cThat was your sister\u2019s idea. She thought I needed to hook up and blow off some stress. But I met you instead. And that might\u2019ve been a really good thing. I\u2019m not trying to get serious or anything so don\u2019t get worked up, but what are we doing here, Gabe? What is this? You and I have been playing cat and mouse since we first saw each other. But I\u2019m tired of playing games.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a second, then bends to press a kiss on the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cThis is you and me, Madison. This is just you and me. We might be fucked up in some ways, but like Jacey says, we\u2019re good people. We\u2019ll figure it out. Everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>I nod and count his breaths, then listen to his heartbeat for a while. I count the steady beats and while I do, I can\u2019t help but ponder how everyone has issues. Some are more horrible than others, and so often, people just walk around with their painful secrets buried deep down inside because they are so ashamed of them.</p><p>Just when I\u2019m almost asleep, I ask one last question.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone in the world broken, Gabriel?\u201d Even to my own ears, my whisper itself sounds broken in the velvety night. I can feel the weight of Gabriel\u2019s gaze as he stares down at me in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he finally answers. \u201cIn their own way.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me close, kissing me softly on the mouth, before I settle back into his side. Before long sleepiness does overtake me and I slip into the oblivion that only sleep can offer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I wake up, the sunlight is streaming through my windows, and Gabriel is gone.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>I sit up and stretch, basking like a sated cat in the sunlight pouring across my bed. I\u2019m warm and perfectly comfortable. Except for the fact that Gabriel isn\u2019t here. But that\u2019s no surprise. He told me he couldn\u2019t stay.</p><p>There\u2019s shit you don\u2019t know about me.</p> <p>That may be true, but I\u2019m not going to worry about it right now. I\u2019ve put that away because it doesn\u2019t matter today. Gabriel is gone and last night was amazing.</p><p>I stretch and throw the covers back, picking up Gabe\u2019s pillow and holding it to my nose. It smells like man, musky and outdoorsy. Like him. I inhale it, then toss it back in place.</p><p>As I move, I realize that I\u2019m a little sore down there. But that\u2019s not a surprise. I haven\u2019t had sex in quite a while\u2014and last night was... er... vigorous. My cheeks flush as I remember Gabriel bending me onto the table outside. I\u2019d better remember to wipe that thing down before I use it next.</p><p>I pad into the bathroom and brush my teeth as I wait for the shower to heat up. Staring at the water, I can\u2019t help but remember Gabriel bending me over in the shower as well. I blush harder.</p><p>Pretty soon I won\u2019t be able to go anywhere in my house without blushing. If I\u2019m lucky. I have to smile at that, picturing Gabe and me christening every room in the house. It\u2019s an interesting thought and as I daydream about it, I dance around my bathroom singing \u201cI Love Rock and Roll\u201d at the top of my lungs.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help it. I feel so happy today that dancing like a lunatic seems to be the logical thing to do, sore crotch or not. I feel lighter and happier than I\u2019ve felt in a long time.</p><p>He did that.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m spinning around by the shower door, I catch a glimpse of someone big and dark in the bathroom doorway. A shadow.</p><p>I startle, then freeze as I realize who the shadow belongs to.</p><p>Gabe leans casually against the doorjamb, his eyes glinting with amusement.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he says glibly. \u201cI see someone\u2019s in a good mood.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s here.</p><p>My heart practically sings, but just as quickly almost dies from embarrassment when I realize that he just witnessed my personal little karaoke/dance party.</p><p>My face explodes into a thousand shades of red and I turn so I can spit my toothpaste into the sink.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I stammer. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t staying.\u201d</p><p>He grins again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to. Did you know you\u2019re cute when you dance in the bathroom in your underwear? You can\u2019t hold a tune, though.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and grin back. I might as well laugh at myself, right?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t quit my day job, I\u2019m just in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stares at me wryly. \u201cWell, you might not be in a good mood for long,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe road\u2019s flooded. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still here. We can\u2019t get out.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him blankly. \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve gotta be kidding. The last time that road flooded was years ago.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but it\u2019s flooded today. It\u2019s been raining for two weeks straight. It\u2019s not that big of a shock. But it boils down to the fact that we\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re stuck here. Gabe and me.</p><p>Together.</p><p>As I think of the possibilities, I grin broadly.</p><p>\u201cThere are worse things,\u201d I announce, thinking about my daydream of christening every room. I smile impishly at him. \u201cI can think of some things to do.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rolls his eyes. \u201cJudging from that grin, I\u2019m afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m about to respond when a distracting thought suddenly occurs to me that makes me panic.</p><p>\u201cMila. I\u2019ve got to call and see how she\u2019s doing. I won\u2019t be able to get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I rush to my cell phone and drop onto my bed as I call the hospital, my foot bouncing nervously as I wait.</p><p>I had put her out of my mind last night when Gabe and I were... together. I had been so focused on my own pain, my own fear, that I lost myself in him.</p><p>How could I have done that? What kind of person am I?</p><p>After I\u2019m transferred to Mila\u2019s room, Pax answers the phone on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Mila?\u201d I ask by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too,\u201d Pax replies. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Calm down, Maddy. I can tell by your voice that you\u2019re freaking out. Mila slept through the night, they gave her fluids and they\u2019re releasing her today. She\u2019s going straight home to bed. And if you see her up at any point, you have my permission to beat her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission,\u201d I grumble. \u201cI knew her first. But I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to get home. My road is flooded. I don\u2019t know about yours. I can\u2019t even get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs is fine,\u201d Pax answers. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re stuck. Don\u2019t sit there and stew about it. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to,\u201d I promise, as I eye Gabe. He stands in front of me, his muscled torso at eye level. To be honest, it\u2019s hard to think about anything but his exquisite body for the time being. It\u2019s a little distracting. \u201cIs Mila awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the nurse is giving her a sponge bath. I\u2019ll have her call you when we get home.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I turn to Gabe. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to make a couple more calls and then we can figure out what we\u2019re going to do. I wonder how long the road will be closed?\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Do you have anything to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a year\u2019s supply of frozen burritos,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd maybe some rice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we won\u2019t starve,\u201d Gabe points out. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m going to go call Jacey while you make your calls. I\u2019ll need to get Brand to stay with her while I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d</p><p>He ducks out of the room and I call Tony. His part of town wasn\u2019t flooded at all, so he\u2019ll be able to get to the Hill.</p><p>\u201cAnd I saw on the news that it\u2019s only on your side,\u201d Tony tells me. \u201cSo the Hill will be fine. I\u2019ll call you if we need anything, not that you\u2019ll be able to do anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d I grumble. He chuckles, then hangs up.</p><p>I throw some clothes on, a T-shirt and shorts, and find Gabriel in the kitchen, looking through the fridge.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d he says. \u201cYou practically do have a year\u2019s supply of frozen burritos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI already know the irony of owning a restaurant and not being able to cook. You don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I won\u2019t,\u201d he chuckles as he turns around. \u201cI\u2019m making some coffee. I figure you might need it. It took you forever to fall asleep last night.\u201d</p><p>I sniff at the freshly brewed coffee smell and glance at Gabe in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t love you before, I do now,\u201d I tell him jokingly. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think that his knuckles just turned white as he gripped his coffee cup harder. But that can\u2019t be right. I was just joking. Surely he knows that. I snatch a coffee cup from the rack and pour myself a cup.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d I ask dubiously. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get awfully bored if we\u2019re stuck here long.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel lifts an eyebrow. \u201cSeriously? We\u2019re in a nice house on the edge of Lake Michigan. We\u2019ll find something to do.\u201d</p><p>I look around doubtfully. \u201cYou think this house is nice?\u201d In my head I picture Pax and Mila\u2019s palatial beach-side mansion. This place is a shack compared to theirs.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Gabriel answers. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was my parents\u2019. I guess I haven\u2019t given it much thought. When they died, Mila and I inherited it. Mila didn\u2019t want it because she had a little apartment over her shop, so she let me have the house. I keep thinking that I need to renovate or something, to make it mine, but I haven\u2019t gotten around to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there,\u201d Gabriel tells me knowingly. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>If that ever happens. It\u2019s been four years.</p><p>But I don\u2019t want to think about that.</p><p>\u201cI want to go outside and look at the flooding,\u201d I tell him as I push away from the table. \u201cHow close is it to the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very, at least not right now. Have you ever seen it get close?\u201d Gabe asks as we walk out the front door. I nod.</p><p>\u201cOnce. Years ago. I think we still have those sandbags stacked in the basement.\u201d</p><p>I suck in my breath as I step out on the front porch and take in the scene in front of me. There\u2019s water everywhere.</p><p>Fast-moving water has completely covered my road, the kind you can\u2019t drive through or it will carry your car away. The murky water is also lapping at the front edge of my lawn, watery fingers that are even now trying to grab at more ground, moving quickly toward absorbing everything between the road and my house.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you say those sandbags were?\u201d Gabe looks down at me. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need them. That water has moved at least three feet toward your yard since I looked at it fifteen minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe basement,\u201d I tell him as I spin on my heel and dart toward the basement door. I jog down the steps and find everything just as my parents left it in my dad\u2019s dark underground workshop. The sandbags line the very back wall, at least twenty rows of them.</p><p>\u201cThere was a bad flood ten years ago or so,\u201d I tell Gabe as I grab one and haul it back toward the stairs. It\u2019s heavy\u2014probably fifty pounds, but Gabe grabs four of them easily. \u201cDad kept the sandbags in case we ever needed them again. They were a pain in the butt to fill up the first time. He figured we didn\u2019t need to do it twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d Gabe nods. He acts like lugging two hundred pounds up the stairs is no problem at all. As we burst out the front door again, Gabe heads farther out than I would have expected.</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, he tells me, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stack them a ways out. If we don\u2019t and the water seeps through, it can actually cause more damage to your house by trapping the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense. How did you know that?\u201d I ask curiously as I follow him, dropping the sandbag into place on the ground, starting a line. He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI know stuff,\u201d he answers wryly, as he lines his bags up with mine. \u201cI\u2019m smart like that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t comment on that. Instead I wonder about what kinds of things he must\u2019ve done when he was a Ranger as we head back into the basement for more bags.</p><p>We end up making more trips than I can count. With each trip the stairs seem a little steeper and the yard seems just a little farther from the house.</p><p>By the time we carry the last bags out and stack them around the perimeter, the wall of bags is four feet high. The water has crept forward by another two feet, and my arms and legs are shaking like leaves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even through I\u2019m covered in a layer of sand and dirt, I drop onto the couch, flopping onto my back.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap. I couldn\u2019t carry one more bag if I tried,\u201d I moan. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you carried so many. You carried four times as many as I did, and you\u2019re not bothered at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m a badass,\u201d Gabriel says lightly, picking up one of my arms and rubbing at it. \u201cYou really are shaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knoooowww,\u201d I groan. \u201cCarrying one bag is fine. Carrying a hundred starts to get to a person.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel shakes his head a little, but doesn\u2019t stop rubbing my arm. The warmth of his hand feels good against my skin. I flip onto my side, looking him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll keep the water out?\u201d Even as I ask, I\u2019m not sure that I care. If this house is destroyed by water damage, I\u2019ll get a brand-new one with the insurance money. One that doesn\u2019t carry bad memories in it.</p><p>Gabriel nods. \u201cIt should. Temporarily, I mean. I can\u2019t imagine the water will stay up very long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I murmur. As long as we don\u2019t have to worry about the house being flooded while we\u2019re in it, I\u2019m good. And with Gabe\u2019s hands on me, I\u2019m really good.</p><p>\u201cThank you for helping me,\u201d I tell him quietly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p> <p>He lifts a dark eyebrow. \u201cAnd how would you have carried all of those bags by yourself? You\u2019ve got spaghetti arms.\u201d</p><p>I sputter and he laughs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he continues, ignoring my indignation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own personal hero,\u201d I declare, smiling into his eyes. His expression turns a little cloudy, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>He simply says, \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>Once again I find myself thinking about Gabe in combat gear, dusty and hot, running with a rifle to rescue someone. But that\u2019s where my daydream ends, because I don\u2019t know exactly what he did as a Ranger.</p> <p>So I ask.</p><p>Gabe tenses, then relaxes, almost like he\u2019s forcing himself to.</p><p>\u201cA little of everything,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe did some search and rescue, some recon, some surveillance. Our team was a specialized unit. But unfortunately, most of what we did was classified. I can\u2019t talk about it. It drives Jacey crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d I smile, thinking of Jacey\u2019s inquisitive nature. \u201cI\u2019m sure it kills her. Speaking of her, is everything all right over there? Is the water near your grandparents\u2019 house? We were so busy with my house that I forgot to ask you about yours.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNope. No water. They\u2019re fine. Brand\u2019s going to stay with Jacey until I get there just to make sure Jared doesn\u2019t try anything. I think he\u2019s probably done harassing her now, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>I remember Jared\u2019s terrified expression at the gas station a few days earlier. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably intimidated now,\u201d I agree. \u201cBut like you said, you never know. He\u2019s a dumbass. And if Brand doesn\u2019t mind being there, it\u2019s probably a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrand doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good.\u201d I get off the couch and stare down at Gabe. \u201cI\u2019m covered in sand. I\u2019m going to take a quick shower. Help yourself to anything you need; just make yourself at home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you play your cards right, I\u2019ll give you a massage when you get out,\u201d Gabriel offers. \u201cYou got a big workout carrying those bags. We should probably rub the lactic acid out of your muscles so you don\u2019t get sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that sounds so... clinical,\u201d I laugh. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s a massage, so I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>I walk down the hall and I can feel his stormy gaze watching me as I go. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking, but it seems as dark as he is.</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>What the fuck am I doing?</p><p>Obviously I can\u2019t help being here, but why the fuck am I acting like a domesticated pussy-whipped idiot? Jesus. I\u2019m not pussy-whipped.</p><p>Madison is pussy. Pure and simple.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t mean anything to me.</p><p>I don\u2019t care how many times her eyes turn soft when she looks at me, when they\u2019re normally jaded and worldly. I don\u2019t care how many times she calls me her own personal hero. I don\u2019t care that she\u2019s damaged on the inside, in a way that reminds me of Jacey\u2014and of the damage that my father did to her. But Madison\u2019s damage is far, far worse than Jacey\u2019s.</p><p>And it\u2019s not my job to fix her.</p><p>I can\u2019t even fix myself.</p><p>I go through two cups of coffee while I wait for her on the sofa, as her \u201cquick\u201d shower turns into half an hour. But when she comes out dressed only in a T-shirt and panties, I\u2019m wide awake without the aid of caffeine. I can see the outline of her perky nipples through her shirt and all my previous arguments about how little she means to me go out the window.</p><p>Especially when she looks at me with those soft eyes. Eyes that aren\u2019t soft for many people. It clenches my stomach into a fucking knot.</p><p>You can\u2019t trust me. But obviously I can\u2019t say that.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say instead. \u201cFeel better?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYeah. I stood under the hot water for a while. I\u2019m sorry to keep you waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSeeing your nipples was worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, her cheeks flushing. \u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder me on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Madison startles, but then I laugh. \u201cUnder my hands. I just meant under my hands.\u201d</p><p>She smiles back at me, but tugs me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll lie on my bed. Then we\u2019ll both be comfortable. I have to tell you something, though.\u201d She pauses and blushes, which immediately piques my interest. This ought to be good. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sore. Down there, I mean. So...\u201d</p><p>I interrupt. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can rub that too.\u201d At her look of utter chagrin, I burst out laughing. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Maddy. I won\u2019t try anything. We\u2019ll be fine on the bed. I mean, if you can control yourself.\u201d</p><p>She turns around and walks down the hall. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who needs that talk. The little man there needs that talk.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I realize that she\u2019s talking about my dick, I bristle.</p><p>\u201cHey, never, in any situation, should you call him \u2018little man.\u2019 The word little should never be used in conjunction with my penis.\u201d</p><p>She laughs as she walks into her room and sits on her bed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I don\u2019t think you really need reassured about your big size, army man. It\u2019s the reason I\u2019m in the shape I\u2019m in, and you know it.\u201d She\u2019s smiling, and I can tell she\u2019s sufficiently impressed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d I grumble as I settle onto her bed. \u201cYou can use that word all you want.\u201d</p><p>A wicked gleam shines in her eyes and she flips onto all fours, crawling up over me.</p><p>\u201cBig army man. I love your big muscles.\u201d She trails her fingers along my biceps, up and over the contours, following the line of my neck. She turns my face toward her and touches her lips to mine. She tastes like honey. \u201cAnd I love your big... ego.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, but hold her tight to me, my tongue tangling with hers again.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you love of mine?\u201d I ask softly, dipping my head to kiss her neck.</p><p>\u201cI love your big sense of humor,\u201d she whispers, her hands trailing over my shoulders. \u201cAnd your big smile, when you choose to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I whisper back.</p><p>Her eyes meet mine and hers are so fucking blue. She kisses me again and then sits on me, wedging her hips tight against my crotch. My dick is rigid against her, rock-hard and straining against my underwear.</p><p>\u201cI love...\u201d she whispers, her lips touching mine. \u201cYour big cock.\u201d</p><p>I almost choke when she says the word. Not only does she say it, she places extreme emphasis on it. It seems so strange coming from her lips. But she\u2019s feisty. I knew that. And Christ, I love that about her.</p><p>But she means nothing, right? My own thoughts taunt me and I gulp as her hand drops down to my lap and her fingers rub the length of me.</p><p>I groan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop,\u201d I manage to say. \u201cSeriously. Before you kill me. If you don\u2019t want to fuck me, you\u2019ve got to stop.\u201d</p><p>She laughs lightly and hops off.</p><p>\u201cThat was a fun game,\u201d she says, her eyes twinkling. \u201cWhat do you want to play next?\u201d</p><p>I drop a pillow onto my head and take deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a female devil,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSeriously evil.\u201d</p><p>She only laughs harder. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who made me sore,\u201d she reminds me. \u201cSo just remember that.\u201d</p><p>A thought occurs to me.</p><p>\u201cTurnabout is fair play, you little demon. On your belly. Now.\u201d</p><p>Good-naturedly she flops onto her belly and I straddle her slender form. I bend down and whisper into her ear.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart. It\u2019s not going to be that easy. I\u2019m giving you a massage. You\u2019re going to have to take your shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Without saying anything or even looking at me, she strips her shirt off and tosses it to the side. She\u2019s not wearing a bra. Suddenly I can\u2019t decide if my punishment for her is going to be harder on her or on me.</p><p>She means nothing.</p><p>She means nothing.</p><p>I remind myself of that as my hands span the width of her back and I rub her muscles soothingly, her skin soft beneath my fingers.</p><p>My dick doesn\u2019t get that memo about how little she means to me and how little she affects me. Because each touch makes me a little harder and with each stroke my dick presses more and more into her ass. Fucking traitorous appendage.</p><p>I know Madison\u2019s acutely aware of it, but she doesn\u2019t point it out. She simply remains relaxed, facedown on the bed.</p><p>I move down to her feet and pick one up, rubbing every inch of it before I continue up her leg, up and over her knee and onward up to her thigh. I knead, pull and rub every inch of her. Up to her neck, down to the small of her back. Her breaths are coming in small little pants now and I smile. She\u2019s not as unaffected as she would have me believe.</p><p>And why does her body have to be so fucking perfect?</p><p>I slide my hands around her hips and pull her up just a little, as my fingers slide to the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>She inhales sharply and I smile again.</p><p>Leaning forward, I whisper into her ear, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>And then I bury my fingers slowly inside her, moving in circles as I slide them in and out. I kiss between her shoulder blades as my fingers fuck her. Within minutes her body tightens up and she moans. When she falls limply back against the bed, she turns to me, her cheeks flushed.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d she asks, her eyes slightly glassy. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t have sex with you right now.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for me, pulling me to her before she buries her face into my chest.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cBut since I\u2019ve massaged it for you, maybe tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She giggles and nestles into me even tighter. \u201cMaybe. If you play your cards right. For now, though, God, I\u2019m tired from those stupid sandbags. Let\u2019s take a nap.\u201d She closes her eyes, but after a minute opens them again with a random question.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss the Rangers? What rank were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day.\u201d My answer is immediate. \u201cIt\u2019s all I ever wanted to be. And I was good at it. I was a first lieutenant when I discharged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there a way that you could\u2019ve stayed in?\u201d she asks, opening her eyes and looking up at me. \u201cSomehow?\u201d</p> <p>I pause, stricken, but try not to show it. It\u2019s a question that I asked myself a hundred times before I made the decision to resign.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a way. If there was, I would\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy doing what you\u2019re doing now?\u201d she asks curiously.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m happy doing what we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re going to help other soldiers. Brand and I went through something shitty. And if other soldiers don\u2019t have to go through that because of our armor, it\u2019ll make me real fucking happy.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cThe thing you went through... is that part of the shit you don\u2019t want to talk about?\u201d I nod.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, she lets it go. I stare down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? Jacey told me that once upon a time, you were going to be a model or something. Are you happy here in Angel Bay?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s quiet and I know I struck a nerve.</p><p>Finally she shrugs.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t meant to be,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cSometimes shit happens, and all we can do is our best. This is my best.\u201d</p> <p>I stare down at the gorgeous woman curled into my side. I might be obtuse about women but even I can hear the resignation in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay here, you know,\u201d I point out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live this life if it isn\u2019t what you want. It\u2019s clear you don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>Madison blinks, staring off into the distance. I\u2019m not sure, but it seems like she might be trying not to cry.</p><p>\u201cIt is what I want,\u201d she finally answers. \u201cI wanted to be near Mila. And even though she\u2019s leaving soon, Angel Bay is home. The restaurant is here and running it is my responsibility. And besides, you\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re here now.</p><p>My chest tightens and my stomach tenses up. Because I wanted to fuck her without strings, without worrying that I\u2019d hurt her. Because I know that I will. She seems tough, but it\u2019s obvious that on the inside she\u2019s fragile. It\u2019s only a matter of time until I fuck up and she needs to know that.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, me being here might not be a good thing,\u201d I tell her. \u201cThat shit that you don\u2019t know? It\u2019s pretty ugly.\u201d</p><p>She nods, her hair brushing my chest.</p> <p>\u201cI figured it was,\u201d she agrees. \u201cOr else you wouldn\u2019t hate talking about it. But it doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that you\u2019re a good person on the inside, Gabe. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so glad I figured out what you\u2019re really like. On the outside, you\u2019re this cocky badass with a secret. But on the inside, you\u2019re good. I don\u2019t have to worry about you hurting me anymore.\u201d</p><p>She falls silent and I rub her arm as she fades into sleep. After a half hour or so, her breathing evens out and I know she is definitely asleep. That\u2019s when I finally answer her.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d I whisper, before I carefully disentangle my limbs from hers and crawl out of the bed.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Madison</p><p>I wake up from my nap, finding myself alone. I sigh, then stretch. A glance at my clock tells me that I\u2019ve been asleep for an hour and a half. I rarely nap at all, so I must\u2019ve been exhausted.</p><p>As my head clears I remember the flood. I leap from the bed and race to the living room windows, staring outside.</p><p>The water has made its way up to the wall of sandbags, and is lapping against it. For now, the sandbags are doing their job.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Gabriel says from behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s holding nice and tight. As long as the water goes down in the next couple of days, it should be good.\u201d</p><p>I turn around. Like always, I think I could stare at him forever. He\u2019s not perfect in a male-model kind of way. He\u2019s perfect in a rugged, sexy-as-hell kind of way. Masculine. Powerful. Strong.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks curiously as I stare. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Did you find things to do while I took a nap?\u201d</p><p>Gabe nods as we head into the kitchen. \u201cYeah. I got turned around a few times. A few minutes ago, I think I found my way into your parents\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>My gut immediately clenches, a stupid and extreme reaction to something so simple. I keep their door closed for a reason but obviously Gabe didn\u2019t mean to intrude.</p><p>\u201cNo big deal,\u201d I tell him airily, pretending to be casual. \u201cNo harm done. Did you close the door when you came out?\u201d</p><p>Please have closed the door. I don\u2019t want to see in there.</p><p>Gabriel stares at me, curiosity in his dark eyes, like he can see through me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. Maddy, their room looks like it must\u2019ve looked the day they died. Your dad\u2019s boots are still by the door, caked in mud.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, staring at me. I stare back. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Gabe shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s not my business. I was just curious. I wasn\u2019t judging.\u201d</p><p>I know he wasn\u2019t. Just as I know it\u2019s weird that I\u2019ve left their room untouched. But grief does weird things to a person. So does guilt. I honestly just wanted to close their door and not think about it. Or them.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s weird,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. Even to myself, really.\u201d</p><p>Even though it\u2019s been four years.</p><p>Gabe stares at me again, his dark eyes softening. I see sympathy in them. \u201cWant to go for a walk on the beach?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod. I throw a pair of shorts on and we make our way out my back door and down the path and spill out onto the beach. The air is cool and I can feel the moisture in it\u2014both from the lake and from the flooding around us.</p><p>Overhead, sea gulls circle and cry.</p><p>In front of us, Lake Michigan crashes hard against the shore, disturbed by the recent storms. I know that if we walked down to the nearest public beach, the red flags would be flying... a symbol that the current is dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ever see you in the summers?\u201d I ask Gabe. \u201cJacey said you didn\u2019t come into town because you were shy. But that doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, looking out at the water. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I spent a lot of time with our grandfather, fishing and stuff. Jacey and Gran were the ones who came into town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d I answer. \u201cBut I wish I would\u2019ve met you back then.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughs. \u201cI think you would\u2019ve been underwhelmed. I was so dead set on joining the military that it was all I could think about.\u201d</p><p>And you gave that up for some reason that you won\u2019t talk about.</p><p>That idea, that notion, makes me crazily sad.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s for the best. I was sort of a wild child. You probably wouldn\u2019t have liked me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d he answers, and as he does, he picks up my hand and holds it. That simple little thing sends my heart ricocheting off my rib cage. It seems so intimate.</p><p>To keep from saying something stupid about it, I start chattering about my escapades, the way I used to be, the trouble I used to get into with my parents, especially my dad.</p><p>When Gabe looks at me seriously, I quickly regret mentioning that last part.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand it when a man takes his anger out on a woman,\u201d Gabe tells me. \u201cSo I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t really have an open mind when I hear about your dad. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I tense up, then remember that Pax told him about my dad. I don\u2019t know how much, but probably enough. I stare at the wet sand as we walk, unable to meet Gabe\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI know. But the world isn\u2019t always black and white. There\u2019s a million different shades of gray. I doubt that\u2019s something you\u2019ve had to deal with in the Rangers. I\u2019m sure everything is either right or wrong for you. But for normal people, there\u2019s a whole lot of space between the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you defending your dad?\u201d Gabe raises an eyebrow. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>The blood rushes into my head and I swallow hard. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just... you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen help me to,\u201d Gabe implores me. \u201cSeriously. I\u2019d like to wrap my head around your rationale. It\u2019s clearly something that has messed you up, even still. Yet you still defend him. You still keep his boots untouched by his bedroom door, almost like you\u2019re hoping that he\u2019ll come back. I don\u2019t mean to be a dick and I don\u2019t mean to pry. But Jacey does this same shit with our dad. He doesn\u2019t hit her, but he disappoints her time and again and she always hopes for more. I don\u2019t understand it. If someone has shown you their true colors, chances are they aren\u2019t changing. Why do you hope for more? Why do you hold your dad\u2019s memory in a sacred place when he fucked you up?\u201d</p><p>My breath is frozen as I stop in my tracks and stare at Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hold my dad\u2019s memory in a sacred place. It\u2019s complicated. I loved my parents. And I hated them. And I miss them. And I don\u2019t want to think about them. All of that combines into something that I don\u2019t know how to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stares at me, unflinching. \u201cHow you can love someone who hurt you like that?\u201d</p><p>I sigh raggedly. It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve wondered about a million times.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s complicated too. But my dad was a good person... until he got mad. And when he got mad, he totally lost his shit. Like, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Honestly, it\u2019s one of the reasons why it unnerved me so much that first night with you in Chicago. You were like night and day too. Calm and cocky, then you lost your shit. I thought you might be like my father.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looks aghast. \u201cHoly fuck, Madison. I didn\u2019t know your father, but I can guarantee you that I\u2019m nothing like him.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know. But you were so different, like you just flipped a switch that night and then you punched a wall out of nowhere. After growing up with my father, it was terrifying.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looks uncomfortable, almost embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he finally says. \u201cI wish I could explain. But it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you should understand how things aren\u2019t always black and white,\u201d I answer, feeling a little satisfaction at the conflicted look on his face. He looks unsure now. Unsettled.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about your parents,\u201d he replies, redirecting me, avoiding my statement. \u201cPax told me a little, but not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you grow up with someone like my father, someone who is wonderful most of the time, but a complete ass a quarter of the time, it messes with your head. You start thinking that it\u2019s normal, or that you deserve it, or in our case, sometimes I wondered if my mom deserved it. But deep down, I always knew she didn\u2019t. And then I\u2019d get mad at her for staying... even though I loved him at the same time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt sounds like it really messed with your head,\u201d Gabe says quietly. \u201cBut you always knew it wasn\u2019t your fault, right?\u201d</p><p>I step over a piece of driftwood and then stare out at the water, thinking about the one time that I didn\u2019t. \u201cUsually,\u201d I answer. \u201cExcept for once. The one time he hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit,\u201d Gabe suggests, guiding me by the elbow to a big piece of driftwood. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear this. What made a grown man hit a kid?\u201d</p><p>My eyes start to burn as I think about it and I swallow hard. Blurry memories start coming back to me, memories that I\u2019ve purposely not thought about in years.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t a kid,\u201d I correct him. \u201cI was seventeen. My dad came home from the Hill pissed off about something from work and my mom wasn\u2019t home. I had no idea where she was but my dad thought I was lying for her. When he got mad like that, there was no reasoning with him.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me over and over where she was and I told him over and over that I didn\u2019t know. And then he just backhanded me. Hard. I went flying backward onto the couch. It felt like my entire face had exploded, it hurt that much. But that really wasn\u2019t the worst of it.\u201d</p><p>I pause, and wipe away a tear that has broken rank and fallen down my cheek.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s hand has clenched tightly around my own, tightly enough that his knuckles are white.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the worst of it?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>His voice is grave and I can\u2019t bring myself to look him in the eyes. I\u2019m afraid the expression I find there will send me over the edge and I\u2019ll break down again.</p><p>\u201cHe stood over me, screaming that I was a worthless whore like my mom. That I was lying for her because I was just like her. That I\u2019d never be anything but a whore.\u201d</p><p>Gabe sucks in his breath and holds it. \u201cAnd you thought that was your fault?\u201d</p><p>I finally bring myself to look up at him. \u201cNot exactly. But it\u2019s why I left for New York at the first opportunity. To get away. And that\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve felt guilty about that ever since. I left Mila and I left my mom... I left both of them here to deal with his shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMila was at college, though, right?\u201d Gabe asks quietly. \u201cAnd your mom chose to stay. That was her decision, not yours. You had to look out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMila went to a college just an hour away. She drove back and forth. She still lived at home.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m silent now, staring at my feet, staring at the water, staring at the sky. Finally Gabe takes his finger and turns my face toward him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about, Maddy. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel guilty for everything,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cI feel guilty for hating him, I feel guilty for loving him. I feel guilty for hating my mom for staying. I feel guilty for leaving her. I feel like nothing I will ever do will make up for any of it.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep shaky breath and Gabe stares at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here now,\u201d he says quietly, his thumb stroking mine. \u201cYou gave up your life in New York to make up for it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve never consciously admitted, but I know he\u2019s right. It\u2019s a thought that pisses me off. Everything about it pisses me off. And it pisses me off that he pointed it out.</p><p>\u201cWhat does everyone want from me?\u201d I demand suddenly, anger clouding my vision. \u201cYou, Ethan, Mila, Jacey... everyone is always telling me how unhappy I should be. How I act old, how I act boring, how I\u2019m not myself. Of course I\u2019m not myself. I had to give up everything to come back here and live my parents\u2019 life! Do you think I wanted this?\u201d</p><p>I can feel my pulse beating in my temples as furious waves pass through me over and over.</p> <p>Gabe stares at me, but not in surprise. It\u2019s like he\u2019s been expecting me to get pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d I ask again, my voice shrill. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shakes his head, still calm. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from you. I just realized that you gave everything up. And I can relate to that. That\u2019s all. I know how you feel.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath, thinking about that. He did give everything up, but his situation was different.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how I feel,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me silently, taking that in. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know exactly how you feel. But I know what it\u2019s like to live a life you don\u2019t want. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>I look at him, startled. Where did that come from?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer uncertainly.</p><p>He smiles, a gentle, beautiful smile. \u201cGood. Because I want you to hear me out without getting pissed and defensive.\u201d</p><p>The way he says that puts me on edge, because I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to like it. I can just tell from his tone of voice.</p><p>But before I can say that, he continues.</p><p>\u201cWe did some scary shit in the Rangers, and because of that, I know what fear looks like. You\u2019re afraid, Maddy. You\u2019re afraid to tackle your demons. And until you do, you\u2019re always going to be hung up in the past.</p><p>\u201cThe good news is that fear is a choice. You can stand in front of it, punch it in the face and get on with life.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him sharply. \u201cYou mean like you have? No offense, Gabe. But you shouldn\u2019t really be preaching at me about dealing with my shit. Not when you haven\u2019t dealt with your own.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, his eyes hardening, then softening. As if he caught himself getting pissed and stopped it.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are two different people with two different issues. And we\u2019re talking about you right now. I\u2019m trying to help you. Do you want my help or not?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I stare at him uncertainly, my thoughts wavering. He stares back, unafraid of speaking his mind, unafraid of pissing me off, unafraid of everything.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I finally answer honestly. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Gabe smiles patiently as he slides off the driftwood and pulls me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you do.\u201d</p><p>As I stare at him, at his strong hands, his chiseled jaw, his wide shoulders, I know that he knows what he\u2019s talking about. He knows what it\u2019s like to be terrified of something, but to do it anyway. Just because he\u2019s got one thing that he can\u2019t deal with doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t face fear a million other times in the Rangers. And I do trust him.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I murmur. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>We walk back to the house and down the hallway to the bedrooms, Gabriel\u2019s hand on my arm, both to guide me and to hold me in place when we stand staring at my parents\u2019 closed door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind,\u201d I announce as the wood door yawns in front of me. I try to turn around. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</p><p>Gabe holds me in place.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. And you can do it. Fear is a choice, Maddy. Choose not to be afraid. You can start today. You don\u2019t like your life now? Change it. Start by facing this room.\u201d</p><p>I take a ragged breath back in and turn around.</p><p>In my head I picture my father when he was angry, face red, veins popping out in his temples, as he stormed through this door to find my mother. Then I picture him when he wasn\u2019t angry. Calm, loving, patient.</p><p>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I\u2019ve always had to carefully screen what I remember so that I don\u2019t get upset. And I\u2019m really tired of being held an emotional prisoner to memories.</p><p>I turn the doorknob and open the door.</p><p>It is still and silent in here, almost like a mausoleum. I sniff at the stale air, glancing at the walls covered in pale-pink flowered wallpaper. The room is clearly a female\u2019s domain, as well it should be, as often as my mother secluded herself in here.</p><p>Mila has been in here a couple of times since they died, but other than that, this room is untouched. I take a step inside, looking at my dad\u2019s boots by the door, their dirty clothes in their basket, my mom\u2019s makeup scattered across her vanity. I take another step, then another, until I find myself sitting cross-legged on their bed. My fingers shake as I try not to think about where I am.</p><p>Instead I stare into space, thinking back to the day they died.</p><p>\u201cI was in Times Square when they died,\u201d I tell Gabe softly. \u201cI lived in New York. I hadn\u2019t been there very long. But anyway, I was with a group of girls from the modeling agency when Mila called me. She was so hysterical that I couldn\u2019t tell what she was saying for a minute. But I\u2019ll never forget the feeling of standing in the middle of such a crowded place and suddenly feeling so very alone.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re gone, Mad, Mila had sobbed. They\u2019re just gone.</p><p>\u201cAnd for a second, just a second, all I felt was relief. I would never have to deal with their twisted drama again. But I pushed that horrible feeling aside and did what needed to be done. I was on a plane within hours and I never went back to New York. My roommate boxed up my stuff and sent it to me and I never looked back.\u201d</p><p>Until now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gabriel whispers, rubbing my back with one hand and pulling me to him with the other. \u201cBut in your situation, it was normal to feel all kinds of things, not just grief.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cMy head knows that. But my heart thinks there\u2019s something wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>I slide from the bed and start sifting through my mom\u2019s trinket drawer. A large drawer in the top of her dresser houses anything she was sentimental about. Old pictures, random pieces of jewelry, love notes from my dad.</p><p>I pick one up, the handwriting bold and scrawled even as it is faded and old.</p><p>My love,</p><p>I hate being away from you. Every minute seems like an hour, every hour seems like a day. In only three days, we\u2019ll be married and our lives can truly begin.</p><p>I hope you like the flowers.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Kent</p><p>My eyes well up at the thought that they were once so happy, without issues or drama, without abuse or fights. I can hardly remember a time when my father\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t hanging over our heads.</p><p>\u201cMy mom used to tiptoe around my dad\u2019s temper. She tried so hard to make sure he never got angry because she didn\u2019t want to deal with the repercussions. We learned to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>I hand the letter to Gabe and pick up another one.</p><p>Nan,</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry about last night. I\u2019m sorry I lost my temper. It\u2019s just that the thought of you leaving me makes me crazy.</p><p>If you leave, I\u2019ll be nothing.</p><p>Please forgive me.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Forever,</p><p>Kent</p><p>A tear streaks hotly down my cheek and I furiously wipe it away before I throw the entire drawer across the room, as hard as I can. It slams into the wall and everything in it explodes in a cloud of junk on the floor.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Dad,\u201d I tell him as though he were standing right next to me. \u201cFuck you, fuck you, fuck you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe picks up the letter and looks at it, then stares at me. \u201cYour mom almost left him?\u201d</p><p>I nod, not even caring that the tears are flowing freely now.</p><p>\u201cA hundred times. But she never did. She would tell us to pack a suitcase and to go get in the car, so we would. But we\u2019d wait out there for hours because they\u2019d scream and fight and then make up. And all the while, she\u2019d forget that we were out in the car waiting. Waiting for her to be strong and change our lives. But she never did. And I hated her for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m practically screaming now. As Gabe watches in astonishment, I rip open their closet door and start yanking clothing from the hangers and drawers, throwing each piece into a huge pile on the floor of the bedroom. I throw her shoes, his work shirts, his ball caps, her underwear.</p><p>Everything goes.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>After a while I glance at the pile. It\u2019s enormous.</p> <p>\u201cYou forgot these,\u201d Gabe says quietly, holding a stack of old greeting cards held together with a rubber band. I gesture toward the pile.</p><p>\u201cThrow it on.\u201d</p><p>He tosses it and we both watch as it slides down the mountainous heap.</p><p>Gabe looks at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d throw all of this out in one fell swoop. You\u2019ve got balls, Maddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what the hell am I going to do with all this stuff?\u201d I mutter. The answer comes to me immediately and it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. I look at Gabe.</p> <p>\u201cBonfire.\u201d</p><p>A strange light shines in Gabe\u2019s eyes and he nods enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. Let\u2019s carry this stuff out down to the beach and burn it all.\u201d</p><p>We lug every last piece of the pile down to the damp beach. As we do, I remember all the bonfires Mila and I had down here over the years with our friends. In fact, Ethan came to many of them with us. We\u2019d sit out here in the dark and make s\u2019mores, go swimming and cuddle up around the fire with whatever boyfriend we had at the time.</p><p>This bonfire is very different.</p><p>For one, it\u2019s broad daylight.</p> <p>For two, it\u2019s burning in effigy.</p><p>I turn to Gabe, throwing him a book of matches and a bottle of lighter fluid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to burn everything about my parents that hurt me, everything that caused me issues. My mom might not have been strong enough to deal with it,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I am. Fuck this.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nods, satisfied and pleased by my attitude. \u201cThis is exactly what I meant, Maddy. Fear is a choice.\u201d</p><p>He tosses a pair of my dad\u2019s shoes on the pile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your dad leaving after every fight, after every time he hit your mom,\u201d Gabe announces. Even though he wasn\u2019t there, it\u2019s as if he can see right into my life and knows what happened. Because that\u2019s exactly what my dad did. He left every time, leaving Mom at home to cry.</p><p>Leaving me at home to console her.</p><p>I glance at Gabe in appreciation, then throw a handful of mom\u2019s clothing and belts onto the pile. \u201cThat\u2019s for every time I saw my mom\u2019s bloody nose drip onto her dress... after Dad hit her.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe nods and we take turns adding things to the mountain of memories.</p><p>Screamed words between my parents, a blurred memory of my mother curled up crying, an image of my dad slapping her... all of it goes onto the heap, piled like the rubbish that it is.</p><p>Dried flowers from her closet\u2014sent as an apology for hitting her\u2014go onto the pile as well. His apology wasn\u2019t fucking good enough.</p><p>So I\u2019m going to burn it now.</p><p>Broken promises that he\u2019d never hurt her again, broken promises that she\u2019d leave him if he did... all go onto the pile. There are a lot of them.</p><p>When there\u2019s nothing left to add, I watch as Gabe squirts lighter fluid all over the pile, then turns to me, holding out a match.</p><p>\u201cYou do it,\u201d he tells me solemnly. \u201cYou deserve to do it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the giant mountain and sniff at the acrid smell of lighter fluid as I realize that it symbolizes a monster, a monster that I have allowed to control my life for far too long.</p><p>It\u2019s because of my parents that I\u2019m afraid to get involved with anyone, it\u2019s because of them that I\u2019m afraid any relationship I get into will hurt me, like my dad hurt my mom. Even though my father loved me, he damaged me so much more than he ever knew.</p><p>I don\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>I toss the match and watch as the entire pile explodes into flame. The heat singes my hair, washing over me, and I take a step back. Gabe pulls me to his chest and together we watch my bad memories burn.</p><p>It is surprisingly cathartic.</p><p>I watch the dark smoke curling and wisping into the white sky, carrying the toxic memories away with it. I try to imagine that everything that has lain heavily on my heart for years is floating away... far, far away from me. It\u2019s not my burden to bear. It was theirs and they aren\u2019t here anymore.</p><p>They aren\u2019t here anymore.</p><p>But I am. I have my own mistakes to make... but I sure as hell won\u2019t make the same ones they did.</p><p>We sit beside the raging bonfire for at least an hour. When the fire grows dim I squirt more lighter fluid on it, causing it to rage again. I want to make sure that every bad memory has burned completely away.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel better?\u201d Gabe asks quietly as we walk back up to the house.</p><p>I realize that I do. I feel surprisingly lighter. I\u2019m no therapist, but what I just did was really fucking therapeutic.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThis was a good idea. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry that you had to see me that way, that you had to see all of that... shit. But I thank you for making me face it. I\u2019m sorry I got mad at you.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rubs his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou weren\u2019t really mad at me and I knew that. I\u2019m just glad it helped,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>We heat up some frozen burritos and rice, then sit curled up on the couch until bedtime. After we crawl into bed, Gabe holds me until I go to sleep, but he leaves me afterward.</p><p>I know this because he wakes me up in the night, tossing and turning and mumbling on the couch. He calls out for Brand. He mumbles incoherently. This is the Gabe I saw that first night. This is the Gabe he wants to hide from me. This is the Gabe he doesn\u2019t want to face.</p><p>I watch him for a while before covering him up and padding back to bed. There\u2019s nothing else I can do. He gave me the push I needed to face my demons... because I was ready to do it. That\u2019s the difference between him and me.</p><p>He\u2019s clearly not ready to face his own. I just wonder if he ever will be. And if he\u2019s not, what does that mean for me? Or for us?</p><p>It\u2019s not something I have an answer to, so eventually I give up thinking about it and slip into a fitful sleep.</p><p>When we wake in the morning, the water has gone down. I\u2019m not very happy about it. On the one hand, I\u2019ll be able to go see Mila.</p><p>But on the other, this little bubble that I\u2019ve been in with Gabe will burst and we\u2019ll have to go back to reality. The problem is, I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re ready for it.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>What the fuck is happening?</p><p>My thoughts are a swirling mess as I work out at the gym. I can\u2019t believe this is happening to me. I don\u2019t get attached to women. Ever. I fuck them and I like fucking them. But attached?</p><p>No fucking way.</p><p>Why then am I all tied up in knots about Madison? It\u2019s an exercise in fucking futility because I can\u2019t stay with her. I\u2019m too fucked up and she doesn\u2019t even know the half of it. It\u2019s not right.</p><p>But holy shit, it feels right.</p><p>Is everyone in the world broken, Gabriel?</p><p>I swallow hard as I punch the punching bag harder. Yes, everyone is broken, but I\u2019m the most broken of them all.</p><p>Bile rises in my throat and I swallow it down. She has no idea what a monster I am. And if she knew, she would probably kick me in the balls and run hard in the other direction.</p><p>As well she should.</p><p>You\u2019re someone who won\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>Christ. The memory of her words has a visceral effect on me, tightening my gut. What the fuck am I doing here? Why am I fucking with her? It\u2019s not right.</p><p>It\u2019s not right.</p><p>But when I held her last night, everything felt right in the world. And when I think about walking away from her, everything feels like shit. Am I really selfish enough to want to keep her with me, even though I\u2019m not fit to be with anyone?</p><p>The bad thing caught you.</p><p>I slug at the bag harder, hard enough that my shoulders strain from the effort.</p><p>The bad thing caught you.</p><p>I slug at the bag until I can\u2019t slug at it anymore, until my shoulders are weak and my arm feels like rubber.</p><p>The bad thing caught you.</p><p>I slump to the floor, leaning against the wall as I catch my breath.</p><p>The bad thing didn\u2019t catch me.</p><p>I\u2019m the bad thing.</p><p>I hit the showers, then pick up the phone and call Jacey.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sis. Want to go shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Meet me there in an hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>I taught her to target shoot when we were both still in high school, back when I was still wet behind the ears. I thought that being a Ranger would be the pinnacle of my life. It would make me a man.</p><p>I had no idea that it would break me.</p><p>I swing by the house and pile a Colt AR-15 and several boxes of ammo into my trunk before I head in the direction of the shooting range.</p><p>Over the years Jacey and I have spent hundreds of hours blowing holes in targets, just clearing our thoughts. The repetition of shooting is comforting and familiar. It\u2019s one thing that we can do together, one thing that we both enjoy.</p><p>When I arrive at the range, Jacey is already there and unloading her shit, including her pink fucking nine-millimeter that I always tease her about. She turns to me as I approach, her blonde hair pulled out of her face so she can see.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I glance at her as I set my bag down.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Do you think I have ovaries now? That I\u2019m going to talk about my feelings and shit?\u201d</p><p>Jacey grins. \u201cNope. We\u2019re going to blow some shit to pieces. And then we can talk about your feelings and shit.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and put my orange foam earplugs in.</p><p>For the next two hours we blow the paper targets to smithereens. It\u2019s amazingly satisfying to blow holes through the center of the target, time after time. When Jacey is finally out of ammo and I\u2019m damn close, she turns to me, pulling one of her earplugs out.</p><p>\u201cYou want some dinner?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>We head to the little burger place down the road, where Jace practically orders a side of beef along with a margarita. I stare at her incredulously as I place what seems like a small order now: a double quarter pounder, onion rings and a beer.</p><p>\u201cHave you not eaten in a month?\u201d I ask her as we slide into a cracked vinyl booth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018that\u2019 time of the month, Gabe,\u201d she tells me with a grin. \u201cI could eat two cows and a calf too.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. \u201cTMI, Jace. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>She just laughs.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here, Gabe? Seriously. I know something\u2019s wrong. You might as well just tell me, or you can let me badger it out of you. Either way is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. She\u2019d actually enjoy the badgering part.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up, Jace,\u201d I finally admit. \u201cBig time.\u201d</p><p>She raises a blonde eyebrow. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I sigh and swig my beer, enjoying the cold bite of it as it slides down my throat.</p><p>\u201cMadison.\u201d</p><p>Jacey instantly narrows her eyes. \u201cWhat did you do? I swear I\u2019ll castrate you if you hurt her. I mean it. I don\u2019t want to see your junk, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, staring at the table, swirling my beer in the glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t yet. But I\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>Jacey\u2019s puzzled now. It\u2019s apparent as she looks at me in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m not following you. If you haven\u2019t hurt her yet, then you don\u2019t have to do it.\u201d</p><p>Our food arrives and Jacey dives into hers, eating with more gusto than I\u2019ve ever seen a chick eat with.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I finally tell her with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m fucked up. When you look at me, you see your big brother, same ol\u2019 Gabe. But I\u2019m not that guy anymore. That thing that happened to Brand and me... it seriously fucked me up. Maddy doesn\u2019t deserve someone like me.\u201d</p> <p>Jacey stops chewing and looks at me. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let Maddy decide that?\u201d she suggests. \u201cHave you told her what happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jacey tilts her head, examining me. \u201cHow bad is it? Seriously, how bad can it be? I know you, Gabe. You\u2019re a good person, through and through. I would never have wanted to set you up with Maddy if you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what you don\u2019t get, Jacey,\u201d I answer. \u201cI\u2019m not good through and through anymore. I\u2019m just not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill someone while you were in the Rangers?\u201d she asks curiously. \u201cIs that it? Because that\u2019s dumbass, Gabe. Obviously you had to know that you would kill someone if you joined the Army and went to Afghanistan.\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s not it. And yes, I\u2019ve killed people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worse than that?\u201d Jacey is incredulous. \u201cThen maybe I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>I level a gaze at her. \u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t. But I have a problem now and I don\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t mean to get so close to Madison. I really didn\u2019t. I thought we\u2019d hook up a few times and then I\u2019d go back home. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you really like her, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jacey asks knowingly. \u201cI told you a long time ago that you were perfect for each other.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cI do like her. And she\u2019s been through a lot already. She doesn\u2019t deserve my shit. But I\u2019m selfish enough to not want to leave just yet either.\u201d</p><p>Jacey pushes her plate away and stares at me over it, her arms crossed and a serious expression pasted on her face.</p> <p>\u201cGabriel Joseph Vincent. Do you think you don\u2019t deserve something good in your life? Do you think that whatever happened overseas is so bad that you shouldn\u2019t ever be happy again? Because again, that\u2019s dumbass. You deserve happiness more than anyone I know. In fact, you deserve it more. Listen to me. You need to tell Maddy the truth. Just lay it out there. Let her decide for herself if you\u2019re worth it. You owe it to yourself and to her.\u201d</p><p>I nod, wiping my mouth and tossing the napkin in the plate.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I exhale. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely right,\u201d she answers. \u201cAnd for once it feels good to lecture you, instead of you lecturing me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, we pay the check and then walk out to our cars.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, bro. She\u2019s worth it. She really is. She\u2019s tough and prickly on the outside, but she\u2019s got a heart of freaking gold.\u201d</p><p>I think back to yesterday, to standing in front of that bonfire watching her bad memories burn, and the vulnerable look on her face.</p><p>She\u2019s tough and prickly on the outside but she\u2019s fragile as hell on the inside.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the part of her that I\u2019m afraid of.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, Sis.\u201d I kiss her on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019ll be home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re not, don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she answers. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Jared in a while. I think he\u2019s done messing with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can hope,\u201d I answer as I climb back into my car. Before I start it up, I send Maddy a text.</p><p>Wanna meet me at the pier by your house after you leave work?</p><p>It only takes her a few minutes to reply.</p><p>Sure. Why?</p><p>I answer back, I need to talk.</p><p>A split second later she answers. Hmmm. Ok. I\u2019ll see you around 9:30.</p><p>I head home and shower, messing around the house for a while, until it\u2019s time to go. I leave a little early and sit on the end of the pier with my legs hanging off, throwing stones until Maddy shows up.</p><p>Even if I hadn\u2019t heard her car door slamming in the parking lot, I would feel her presence. She stares a hole between my shoulder blades as she walks down the long pier to meet me. She situates herself next to me, taking a stone from my hand and throwing it. It skips once on the surface of the water, then sinks like the stone that it is.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d Maddy asks quietly. From the look on her face, I think she probably thinks that I\u2019m going to end things with her.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I told you that I had shit you don\u2019t know?\u201d I ask solemnly, heaving another stone out into the water.</p><p>She pretends to think about that. \u201cYeah, I seem to remember something about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I decided you should know about it.\u201d</p><p>Maddy inhales deeply and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. But you were fucking brave yesterday. I\u2019m not pussy enough that I can\u2019t do it too. But you might think I\u2019m a pussy by the time I\u2019m done talking.\u201d</p><p>Maddy sticks her chin out and looks me in the eye. \u201cI doubt it, but there\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, then another. The night air is chilly and fireflies flit around us. For just a second I contemplate changing my mind. But that\u2019s not an option.</p><p>Just do it, you fucking pussy.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I begin. \u201cYou know that I was in Afghanistan with the Rangers. You know that I had to do some shitty things. But there was something, one thing that happened that fucked Brand and me up. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here, in the comfort of air-conditioned homes and eating decent food while our guys are still in the hot-as-hell desert eating MREs.\u201d</p><p>Madison stares at me, waiting.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she says. \u201cI understand that part. And I know that if it wasn\u2019t something terrible, you wouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m ready to hear it. I\u2019m not going to judge you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in the dark. \u201cI need you to know that it was the worst day of my life. I can\u2019t tell you all of it, but I want you to know what you\u2019re dealing with, OK?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me solemnly, nodding.</p><p>I inhale, then exhale. My breath sounds ragged in the night but I ignore it. Instead I focus on the words I\u2019m saying, focusing on each one separately so I can get through them all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to start. Afghanistan was fucking brutal. I guess I can start with that. Hot, sweaty, smelly. Everywhere we went we had to watch over our shoulders. People hated us but pretended they didn\u2019t. It got to be a lot to take. But I could\u2019ve taken it. Forever, if need be, because that was the life I chose. It was what I wanted. But one night something happened that broke me. It completely broke me, Madison.\u201d</p><p>I pause, gathering my thoughts, gathering myself before I continue. I can\u2019t even look at Madison\u2019s face. I don\u2019t want to see what she\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cOne night it was so fucking hot and black, and Brand and I were doing patrols outside of Kabul with our friend Mad Dog. We were leading a four-Humvee convoy, headed to a break-apart point where we would separate into four directions. Right after we separated, a bomb went off. Our Humvee exploded into a million pieces\u2014and it blew Mad Dog apart.\u201d</p><p>Madison sucks in her breath, silently waiting for more. I swallow.</p><p>\u201cHe was a good guy, Maddy. A real good guy. He had a wife and a little baby back home. He got his name from drinking too much cheap ass Mad Dog and he never lost at poker. Ever. He was a good friend. And I repaid him for that by making a decision that blew him into a million fucking pieces.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the water now as I pause to collect myself. Because all I can see in my head is the memory of his intestines piled outside his body in a pool of blood that looked black in the night.</p><p>All I can see in my head is everything else, everything I can\u2019t tell Madison about. The rest of the story.</p><p>Maddy breathes in, then out, and I can see that what I\u2019ve told her is enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Gabriel. Oh my God. It\u2019s just so horrible. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m so sorry. You can\u2019t blame yourself, though. There\u2019s no way that was your fault.\u201d</p><p>I look at her and her gorgeous face is drawn, tightened up in horror.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I made a mistake. That\u2019s what happened that night. And when I came home, I went to Mad Dog\u2019s funeral. When I tried to hand his wife the flag that covered his coffin, she looked me in the eye and said, \u2018It should\u2019ve been you.\u2019 Because it should\u2019ve been. She knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>She knew all the things that I can\u2019t tell Maddy.</p><p>She knew what really happened. She\u2019d read the army\u2019s incident report, the black-and-white words that couldn\u2019t possibly explain the incident.</p><p>Heat flares up in my throat, threatening to close it. I swallow, then swallow again as I try to relax, to breathe.</p><p>Just breathe, motherfucker.</p><p>Maddy wraps her arms around my shoulders and holds me tight, her breath soft on my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t believe that,\u201d she tells me softly, her lips grazing my ear. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe that. You\u2019re strong and good, Gabriel. It was a horrible accident. You didn\u2019t cause it.\u201d</p><p>I look at her again, a lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cI did cause it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know how. What you need to know, though, is that I came home fucked up. The past doesn\u2019t stay in the past, Maddy. I came home with PTSD and I can\u2019t fix myself. I\u2019m not normal anymore. And I don\u2019t think you should be with someone like me.\u201d</p><p>Maddy looks at me, her eyes glistening with unshed tears, filled with sympathy for me. I should hate that, but I\u2019m so fucking glad not to see judgment in them that I don\u2019t. I\u2019m so fucking glad not to see that she thinks I\u2019m weak. Or pathetic. Or all the other things that go through my own mind.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not normal,\u201d she tells me firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re good and strong and brave. You put your life on the line every day for people like me, so that we can sleep safely at night. You did unimaginable things, Gabe. For people like me. Trust me, I want to be with someone like you,\u201d she tells me. \u201cSo don\u2019t even try that shit with me.\u201d</p><p>Then her eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cThat night in Chicago. You were having flashbacks, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nod, not looking at her. \u201cIt happens at fucked-up random times. I can\u2019t control it and that\u2019s the most fucked-up part. It gives me a weakness.\u201d</p><p>Maddy looks at me. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t have a weakness? Even Achilles had a bad heel.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cIf I remember right, Achilles died because of his heel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cGabe, you\u2019re not weak. I\u2019m so sorry that any of this happened to you. You didn\u2019t deserve that. And I hate that you think you have to hide it. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. I\u2019ve heard that lots of soldiers come home with PTSD. Even the biggest and strongest like you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I just shake my head.

I mean, I saw a shrink a couple times, but I didn\u2019t do the extensive program that Brand signed up for. It\u2019s called CPT. It stands for cognitive processing therapy or something like that. Brand told me that it fucking sucked, but still thought I should do it. I said no way in hell. I\u2019ll deal with it on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that working out?\u201d Maddy sounds doubtful.</p> <p>\u201cShitty,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be worse than CPT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does the CPT last?\u201d Maddy asks curiously. \u201cCan you still do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d I answer carefully. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s supposed to be a week of pure hell. I\u2019ve had enough of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d Maddy answers uncertainly. \u201cBut do you remember what you told me yesterday? You said you could see that I\u2019m afraid to face my demons, that until I do, I\u2019ll always be hung up in the past. Those were pretty wise words, Gabe. And I think they might apply to you too.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYour past is different from mine, Maddy. People died because of me. It\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p> <p>She stares at me doubtfully, but doesn\u2019t push it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t.</p><p>But I don\u2019t say that.</p><p>Instead I look at her again. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m a crazy asshole now?\u201d</p><p>She stares at me like I\u2019m actually crazy.</p> <p>\u201cGabe, I saw you melt down in Chicago. Trust me, my imagination was way worse than reality. When you didn\u2019t say anything about it, I thought you might actually be crazy. But you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and hold out my hand to help her up. \u201cDo you hate me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d She\u2019s incredulous. \u201cFor doing your job? For coming home devastated? For losing your friend? Um, no. I respect you even more for what you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re the crazy one,\u201d I mutter as we walk down the pier.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t rule that out,\u201d she agrees. I chuckle, a low sound in the night, before I tuck her into her car. \u201cMeet me at my house,\u201d she suggests. \u201cStay with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>I tense up automatically, out of sheer habit. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know what to expect, right?\u201d she answers. \u201cNightmares, tossing and turning? Trust me, I\u2019ve seen it already. I saw it that first night and I saw it last night. You woke me up from the couch. It\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d</p><p>I picture that girl in Kabul. The blood running down the side of her face. She would beg to differ, I\u2019m sure.</p> <p>But that was almost a year ago. Surely I\u2019ve come a long way since then.</p><p>Surely.</p><p>I finally nod. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll meet you at your house.\u201d</p><p>Maddy grins beatifically. \u201cPerfect. See you there.\u201d</p><p>I get into my car and sit there for a second. I can\u2019t believe I just did that. I might not have told her everything, but I told her some of it and she didn\u2019t run.</p><p>I take a shaky breath in. Then out.</p><p>Is it possible that everything might really turn out OK?</p><p>Is it possible that like Maddy, I can face what happened and move on with life?</p><p>It seems too much to hope for.</p><p>Yet that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing.</p><p>Hoping.</p><p>I start my car and follow Madison\u2019s taillights to her house. In the dark they almost seem like glowing red eyes watching me.</p><p>The bad thing caught you.</p><p>Fuck the bad thing.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Madison</p><p>Driving to my house, I think about what Gabriel said. And it all makes perfect sense.</p><p>No wonder he freaked out in Chicago when our taxi exploded. It was an explosion, for God\u2019s sake. It must\u2019ve seemed just like the bomb in Kabul.</p><p>I swallow hard.</p><p>Hearing him talk like that, so vulnerable and hurt, touches me in a place that I\u2019ve never been touched, a deep-down place where wives and mothers keep their protective instincts.</p><p>It makes me want to wrap my arms around him and hold him where I can protect him, as if I could. I know that I can\u2019t, just as I know he would never allow it. He\u2019s as alpha-male as they come.</p><p>I pull into my driveway, get out of my car and meet Gabe as he\u2019s stepping out of his Camaro. I drag his face down to mine, kissing him hard. He\u2019s surprised, but wraps his arms around my waist, pulling me closer, returning my kiss.</p><p>Finally he pulls back. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cJust for being you.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me skeptically, but doesn\u2019t push it. He simply follows me into the house. Knowing what happened to him puts me in a sentimental mood and all I want to do is sit around and stare at him, marveling at his bravery. Or hold him tight. Or drape myself in his arms. All of these things would make me look crazy, so I don\u2019t do any of them.</p><p>Instead I suggest that we sit in the hot tub.</p><p>\u201cYou have a hot tub?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cHow did I not know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never came up before.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a swimsuit,\u201d he warns me, his dark eyebrow lifted. I smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need one.\u201d</p><p>I tug him by the hand until we reach the sunken hot tub on my veranda. Gabe eyes it in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even notice it was here that first night that we... well, I didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>I laugh as I step out of my shorts, then peel off my top. \u201cWe were a little distracted that night.\u201d</p><p>I take off my bra and then step out of my panties, standing in front of him completely nude. He eyes me in appreciation, his gaze doing a slow sweep up and down my body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little distracted right now,\u201d he admits, undoing his own pants and shedding his clothes.</p><p>He pulls me to him, my skin against his, his hands running up and down my backside.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you that you have the sexiest ass in the world?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t,\u201d I chuckle. \u201cBut feel free to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d he announces against my lips. \u201cI could keep it in my hands all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep it in your hands over here where it\u2019s warm?\u201d I suggest, as I move away from him and toward the hot tub.</p><p>Gabe slips out of his clothes and follows me, and true to form, he does grab my ass as I step into the steaming water.</p><p>Once I sink down in the water, I climb onto Gabe\u2019s lap.</p><p>The feeling of his skin against mine instantly turns me on and I kiss him hard. For a reason that I can\u2019t explain, I need to feel close to him tonight. I want to absorb his pain, all the pain he\u2019s been hiding. I want to take it away so he doesn\u2019t feel it anymore.</p><p>I want to drown in him. I want him to drown in me. My body and his body and nothing in between.</p><p>And there\u2019s only one way I know of that I can do that.</p><p>I slide my hand along his stiff cock, listening to the way Gabe sucks in his breath as I touch him. I love the way his voice sounds in the dark, I love the way he feels against my hand. I love the way he responds to me.</p><p>I love the way he opened himself to me.</p><p>The way he trusted me with himself.</p><p>I love the way he feels beneath me, his thighs under mine.</p><p>I kiss him again, muffling his full-throated groan with my lips, and it\u2019s like he knows my thoughts, he knows all of these things that I love about him.</p><p>And I don\u2019t even have to say it.</p><p>Without another word, I lower myself on him in the water, burying his cock deep inside me, and he throws his head back, gripping my back with his large hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want a condom?\u201d he manages to say, lifting his head and looking at me with stormy eyes. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill. And I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Mad,\u201d he groans, as I lift myself up and down the length of him.</p><p>The water makes it easy to take more of him in me, to sink fully down on him. I can tell it\u2019s driving him crazy. But it\u2019s driving me crazy too. The way his skin slides against me makes me want to cry, my nerves are so feverish, my emotions so raw.</p><p>I want him to come, though. I want to absorb him into me, I want to take everything he can give me. Take and take and take. All of it.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Gabe,\u201d I whisper against his throat, since his head is tipped back. I kiss it slowly, licking the wetness from his skin, tasting him. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>He groans. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, a low and husky sound because I\u2019m so turned on. \u201cThat\u2019s the point,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI want you to come. I want to feel it.\u201d</p><p>I move faster, slipping up and down his length, until he does groan and grab at me, and I know he\u2019s coming. I feel him throb and pulse. I feel the heat of it inside me and I smile.</p><p>\u201cNow was that so hard?\u201d I ask with a smile as I curl onto his lap. He grins.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d he answers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard at all. But you didn\u2019t come. We need to take care of that. Fair is fair.\u201d</p><p>Even as I protest and tell him that he doesn\u2019t need to, he flips me onto my back and holds me against him as he slips his fingers into me. Moving fluidly, he deftly and quickly brings me to my own climax and I come and come, twisting and writhing beneath his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at that,\u201d I finally tell him when I can breathe again. He grins.</p><p>\u201cThank God. You\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I chuckle. We lie in the hot tub until our fingers start to prune.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to drain this, sanitize it, and refill it,\u201d I mention as we climb out and wrap ourselves in towels. Gabe chuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is anyone else besides us going to be using it?\u201d</p><p>He has a point.</p><p>We order Chinese and curl up on the sofa to eat it. We watch a movie until we\u2019re sleepy enough for bed and then it\u2019s finally my favorite time of day.</p><p>I love the night because I love snuggling against Gabe\u2019s hard chest. I love it when his arms close around me and he holds me close. I feel safe and secure, as though nothing from the real world can touch me.</p><p>And tonight he won\u2019t be leaving. He\u2019ll stay with me all night. It\u2019s a thought that makes me smile.</p><p>As I lie inside the crook of his elbow, I listen to the crickets chirping outside my window and the lake crashing against the shore, lulling me to sleep. I listen to Gabe\u2019s rhythmic breathing and the sounds of his light snore when he slips even deeper into sleep.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long it is before I follow him.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much time passes until I\u2019m awakened.</p><p>But it only takes me a brief second to realize that I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s hands are squeezing my throat, his fingers curled around my neck like a vise grip.</p><p>I startle completely awake, thrashing against him as I try to breathe, but his arms are wiry steel bands and I can\u2019t budge them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGabe,\u201d I rasp. \u201cGabe! It\u2019s only me. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>But the look in his dark eyes is dull, he\u2019s not awake. And he clearly thinks I\u2019m someone else.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d he screams at me, his face contorted in anger. \u201cWhy did you do it? She was just a girl. You\u2019re a fucking murderer!\u201d</p><p>He clenches his grip tighter and I can no longer breathe at all. I push at him as hard as I can until my vision begins to tunnel and the edges turn fuzzy.</p> <p>\u201cGabe,\u201d I gasp desperately.</p><p>My chest feels hot from lack of oxygen and my fingers and legs go numb. I can\u2019t feel my hands enough to push at him anymore. My eyelids are too heavy to hold open and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I close them, I might not ever open them again. \u201cGabriel, please...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t speak anymore. Gabe\u2019s grip on my throat is too tight.</p><p>I can\u2019t move. He\u2019s fifty times stronger than I am.</p><p>And I can\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>As I close my eyes and everything goes black, I realize that this is what it\u2019s like to die.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Smoke curls around me, making it impossible to see and just as impossible to breathe. I duck my head closer to the ground as I drag myself by my elbows. The lower I get, the cleaner the air is. The smell of gasoline and burning rubber is almost suffocating and I try to take small breaths.</p><p>\u201cBrand!\u201d I hiss, as quietly as I can. I don\u2019t know who else is hiding in the shadows, who else is watching us, waiting to attack. \u201cBrand!\u201d</p><p>I still can\u2019t see, but I hear a moan, low and ragged, and I keep crawling to find it.</p> <p>The darkness makes it impossible to see and the crackling fire from the burning Humvee makes it almost impossible to hear.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I mutter as a jagged piece of metal cuts into my thigh and wedges in deep. I reach down to pull it out, and my hand comes back bloody. I know I\u2019m in shock because I don\u2019t feel anything, not a thing, even though I am covered in blood. I can taste it, the metallic rusty taste, dripping down my throat. I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019m going to stay conscious because my vision keeps blurring in and out.</p><p>It makes me nervous that I can only hear one person. The blast was bad. And if something happened to Brand, I\u2019ll never forgive myself. I should have seen this coming. I should have acted faster. If only that little girl hadn\u2019t looked so fucking scared.</p><p>\u201cNot Brand,\u201d I tell God. \u201cNot him. Please.\u201d</p><p>I keep crawling through the dirt and finally the smoke breaks and the moon shines brightly enough that I can see the situation a little better. I can see Mad Dog\u2019s still form, lying a few paces away. His legs are no longer attached to his body, his intestines are hanging out of his torso. His blood seems as black as the night as it pools around him.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He\u2019s dead and it\u2019s my fucking fault. But I can\u2019t help him right now. I need to find Brand.</p><p>I spin to the right, hunting for him. I see nothing. I peer into the distance as far as I can see, and I\u2019m relieved to see a slow movement from up ahead. A leg. A combat boot, army-issued. It moves again.</p> <p>Brand.</p><p>Thank fuck.</p><p>I am trying to get to him when I come across the girl.</p><p>Her eyes are glassy and open.</p><p>And her head is detached from her body.</p><p>I know I pass out, because when I next open my eyes, a man is standing over me. Dressed in traditional Afghan garb, he stares down at me wordlessly and I know instinctively who he is. He sent the girl to attack us. He\u2019s not real, though. He\u2019s not real because he wasn\u2019t there that night. My mind is making him up.</p><p>But real or not real, I want to kill him for what he did.</p><p>I lunge to my feet, regardless of my pain, regardless of anything except the rage that is coursing through me. I wrap my hands around his throat.</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker,\u201d I hiss. \u201cShe was a child. You\u2019re a fucking murderer. She didn\u2019t have to die for your fucking misguided beliefs. You\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze tighter when he tries to speak.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d I scream at him. I can see that my hand is covered in blood. \u201cShe was just a girl. You\u2019re a fucking murderer!\u201d</p><p>I want to snap his neck. And I\u2019m going to do it. But first I want him to suffer.</p><p>He needs to suffer for what he did.</p><p>I squeeze tighter, enjoying the way the life drains from his eyes, the way the breath squeezes from his helpless lungs. He deserves pain. He deserves all of it.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, please,\u201d he begs in a forced whisper.</p><p>I squeeze tighter and the man finally goes limp in my hands.</p><p>It\u2019s only then that I realize something.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have known my name.</p><p>I open my eyes to find Madison\u2019s slender neck in my hands, her eyes closed, her body limp. Shock slams into me hard and fast, and I can hardly breathe from the realization of what I\u2019ve done.</p><p>Jesus Christ, I\u2019ve killed Madison.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Madison</p><p>I\u2019m in the dark. Floating in a pond. Or I\u2019m at the end of a dark tunnel. Or maybe at the beginning of one. To be honest, I don\u2019t actually know where I\u2019m at. But everything\u2019s cloudy and warm and soft and I never want to leave.</p><p>Nothing can hurt me here.</p><p>I know that. I can feel it.</p><p>But then someone shakes me, grabbing my shoulders, their fingers digging into my arms. There\u2019s harsh breathing in my ear and mumbling.</p><p>\u201cHolyfuckholyfuckholyfuck.\u201d The words run together, panicky and fast. And I know that voice.</p><p>I\u2019m balanced on a precipice. Because it\u2019s Gabe and he just tried to kill me. He was crazy after all.</p><p>If I open my eyes I\u2019ll be back with him. I\u2019ll have to fight for my life. And do I really want to? It\u2019s so comfortable here. It didn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s all done.</p><p>But if I stay here, it\u2019s all done.</p><p>I\u2019ll never be anything.</p><p>My arms are limp and my body numb as I do the only thing I can do.</p><p>I open my eyes.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>\u201cHolyfuckholyfuckholyfuck.\u201d</p><p>Madison is limp in my arms, not moving.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, wake up,\u201d I beg her, my fingers digging into her shoulder. \u201cWake up. God, please... wake up.\u201d</p><p>Please.</p><p>God.</p><p>She\u2019s limp, pale and fragile. Her eyes are closed, her lashes pressed against her cheek. She\u2019s too quiet, too still. Because God doesn\u2019t listen to me anymore.</p><p>I bend my head, listening for breath, feeling for a heartbeat.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>But wait.</p><p>Yes, it\u2019s there, but barely.</p><p>\u201cMaddy,\u201d I beg, one last time before I completely lose my shit. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t think. I press my lips to her forehead, saying her name against her skin. \u201cGod, please.\u201d I beg one more time for her.</p><p>And just like that, she opens her eyes and stares into mine.</p><p>\u201cGabe?\u201d she asks groggily, her hands cupping her throat as though the effort to speak is too much.</p><p>I drag her to my chest, holding her tightly there, clutching her as my heart races, as I try to make myself believe that I didn\u2019t kill her.</p><p>Is this real? Because I never know anymore. Not at night. Not while I\u2019m sleeping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I tell her raggedly, breathing into her hair. \u201cJesus, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a minute to realize that she\u2019s struggling to get away, her hands fumbling against my chest. Startled, I release her and she scoots away from me, like a cornered animal.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Gabe?\u201d she asks wildly, her hands still gripping her throat. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>As I stare into her wild eyes, I see the worst possible thing I can see. Not anger, not hate, not blame.</p><p>But fear.</p><p>Of me.</p><p>And with that, I know this is real. All of this is real. Everything.</p><p>My gut clenches into a vise grip and I swallow hard, my jaw clenching, then unclenching. I can\u2019t even answer her.</p><p>She stares at me, still panicked. \u201cGet out!\u201d she screeches. \u201cJust get out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m stunned, frozen in place, so she moves instead, scrambling to her feet, rushing for the bedroom door. I watch her run away and I do the only thing I can do because I can\u2019t let her leave like this.</p><p>Not when she doesn\u2019t understand.</p><p>She needs to understand.</p><p>I lunge across the room and grab her, holding her to me, preventing her from leaving. It\u2019s the only thing I can think of to do.</p><p>She struggles, spinning in my arms, hitting at my chest, kicking and clawing.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d she screams, her fingernails raking across my face. \u201cLet go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddy, stop,\u201d I plead quickly, ignoring the burning slashes across my cheek. \u201cJust stop. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. I just want to explain. I swear to God I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She stops and stares up at me uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cLet. Go,\u201d she demands again. \u201cIf you let go, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>I immediately let go and she stands dead still in front of me.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I ask. \u201cI promise you. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. I just want to explain. God, please, Maddy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are hard, but they soften just slightly as I speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d she demands. \u201cTell me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddy.\u201d But my voice breaks and I have to try again. \u201cMaddy, that was... it\u2019s the part that I haven\u2019t told you. That was the bad thing. It caught me and no matter how much I try to get away from it, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll never get away from it because I\u2019m the bad thing now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m babbling, nonsensical. But I don\u2019t know how to fix that because all I want is for her to hear me. To know what I am.</p><p>Maddy\u2019s face shudders, her eyes close, then open. \u201cThe bad thing?\u201d</p><p>Skeptical.</p><p>Doubtful.</p><p>I try to take a breath as I nod.</p><p>\u201cA woman in Afghanistan... afterward. She told me the bad thing had caught me. But she was wrong. I\u2019m the bad thing, Maddy. And I shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near you. I tried to tell you. And now you know. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. Jesus Christ, I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. This is why I wouldn\u2019t sleep with you. It happens when I sleep... the night terrors. They\u2019re so real and I\u2019m not myself. I\u2019m not myself.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, hating the red burning that is behind my eyelids, hating the pressure in my throat, on my heart. Hating that I can\u2019t breathe. Hating this fucking weakness.</p><p>Hating myself.</p><p>But Maddy\u2019s cool hands are on me now and they shake as her fingers brush against my face, caressing my forehead. She ducks her head and whispers into my hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Gabe. I understand. You didn\u2019t mean to hurt me. I see that now.\u201d I know she\u2019s afraid, I can see it in the way her body is shaking, the way her eyes are hooded and guarded, the way she\u2019s ever so slightly curved away from me, like she\u2019s ready to bolt at a moment\u2019s notice if need be.</p><p>But even still, in spite of her fear, she\u2019s here.</p><p>Comforting me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re OK,\u201d she says again, and I\u2019m not completely sure if she\u2019s reassuring me or herself.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d I tell her in anguish, eyeing the already purple marks on her throat. They\u2019re in the perfect shape of my hands. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head drops into my hands.</p><p>\u201cNow do you see?\u201d I ask her. My throat is so dry that it\u2019s hard to speak. \u201cDo you see? This is why you can\u2019t sleep with me. This is why you shouldn\u2019t be with me.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head and pulls at me, clutching, and now I\u2019m practically sprawled in her lap. Her breathing is quick and mine is ragged as we try to calm down, as we both try to process it.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she says bluntly. \u201cTell me the rest. Please. I\u2019m trying to stay calm here, but I\u2019m sort of freaking out. I need to understand.\u201d</p> <p>A flash of the little girl\u2019s face pops into my mind, dark-eyed and terrified. All the bodies, all the blood, the smell of the burning flesh. The smoke.</p><p>Christ.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut, but it\u2019s all still there. It\u2019s still haunting me and I know it always will.</p><p>I open my eyes and glance at Maddy. She waits expectantly, one hand against her throat. I gulp.</p><p>\u201cThe night that our Humvee exploded,\u201d I begin roughly. \u201cIt was so dusty, dusty as fuck. We could barely see our hands in front of our faces and the darkness didn\u2019t help anything. I was talking to Brand, keeping an eye on the horizon, when a movement caught my eye. Something made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I knew it was something bad. And it was.\u201d</p> <p>I pause for a second and the silence yawns between us.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d Maddy whispers, her face pale, hesitant. She doesn\u2019t want to know, but yet she does. She needs to know and I have to tell her. She deserves that much.</p><p>I want to squeeze my eyes shut, wanting nothing more than to block the memory out, but of course I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIt was a little girl. She was coming out of the shadows. I had to focus to see her face and when I did, I saw how terrified she was. And then I saw why. She had a bomb strapped to her chest.\u201d</p><p>Maddy gasps, then freezes, her hands stilled on her throat as she waits for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cIf she detonated that bomb, Maddy, I knew it would tear us all apart. I knew that, but I hesitated anyway. I didn\u2019t want to kill a kid.\u201d I pause and swallow hard.</p> <p>I can hear my tongue moving against the side of my teeth because my mouth is so dry.</p><p>\u201cI watched her for a second\u2014only a second\u2014waiting to see what she would do. I was frozen, Maddy. Every bit of my training was suspended in my mind, because she was just a fucking kid. I saw her little fingers holding the detonator. I saw them shaking. And I knew she didn\u2019t want to push that button.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Maddy asks woodenly, although I can see in her eyes that she already knows.</p><p>I swallow, the memories burning me.</p><p>\u201cI watched her through the sight on my rifle. I yelled out for her to stop. And she looked up at me. Her eyes were begging me. Begging. Black as night and full of fear. Terror. And I knew in that second that she was more afraid of whoever strapped that bomb to her chest than she was afraid of dying. I knew she was going to do it. Her finger twitched and I pulled the trigger.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut, trying not to visualize my memories, trying not to remember the horrible smell in the air that night.</p><p>The blood.</p><p>\u201cEverything exploded. Everything. I couldn\u2019t see. I couldn\u2019t feel. I couldn\u2019t think. I crawled through the smoke and the dust and when I found Mad Dog, he was dead. His legs were gone and his insides were all lying on the outside, on the ground beside him. There was so much blood. I could taste it in my mouth. I can still taste it in my mouth. Every night, over and over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe girl?\u201d Maddy whispers.</p><p>\u201cThe girl... she was in pieces. I found her head. I can\u2019t get the look in her eyes out of my mind. Her eyes were still begging me to help and I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m never going to get away from it.\u201d</p><p>Madison stops breathing as she stares at me in horror. \u201cOh my God. Gabe. Why didn\u2019t you tell me about this? This is... I... it\u2019s horrible. God.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes again.</p><p>When I do I see the girl\u2019s face again, frozen in that moment. Dark skin, dark eyes filled with fear as I shot her, right before everything exploded. Right before everything froze, keeping me there with her forever.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Maddy still looks horrified, but her fingers are moving again, brushing comfortingly against me, soothing me in spite of her horror.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill her, Gabe. Whoever strapped that bomb to her chest did. Not you. You did the only thing you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see her face,\u201d I tell her raggedly. \u201cBut I did. Right before she exploded, she looked at me and everything froze. It was just her and me. We were connected through the lens of my rifle. She needed my help, but I shot her instead. I\u2019ll see it every night until I die. I can\u2019t forget her face.\u201d</p><p>My voice breaks and Maddy\u2019s fingers trail down my face, down my neck, over my back. Her voice spills out in broken whispers, empty words, because she can\u2019t fix me and she knows it. There\u2019s nothing she can say to fix me.</p><p>I\u2019m the bad thing. And now she knows it.</p><p>\u201cGabe, this wasn\u2019t your fault. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d She says it over and over and over. \u201cGabe... God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod didn\u2019t have anything to do with this,\u201d I tell her wearily. \u201cTrust me. He turned his back on that shit a long time ago. And I haven\u2019t told you everything yet.\u201d</p><p>Madison freezes, stricken, her fingers halting their movement on my back, her breath lingering on her lips in horror. \u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t told you the worst part.\u201d</p><p>Maddy closes her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe little girl was a distraction. They bombed my Humvee to distract us from what they really wanted us to see. They wanted us to see it, but not get there in enough time to stop it.\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, trying not to see it all again. All the little bodies, all the mothers\u2019 bodies thrown over their children, all the blood. All the death.</p><p>I swallow.</p><p>Then swallow again, tasting the horror all over again.</p><p>\u201cTaliban rebels wanted to intimidate a nearby village into supporting their insurgent movement. When nothing else worked, they rounded up most of the village\u2019s women and children and slaughtered them in front of the village men. They spared the boys... so that they could turn them into insurgents. Everything else was burned.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom is as quiet as a grave, the only noise being Maddy\u2019s harsh breaths. Her eyes are wide, her hands are clutched in her lap so tightly that her knuckles are white.</p><p>\u201cGabe,\u201d she says limply, but whatever else she was going to say dies on her lips. I stare into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve done my job and shot the little girl, Maddy. I shouldn\u2019t have hesitated. But because I did, hundreds of girls and women died that night. When that bomb went off, it signaled the insurgents that we were close, that it was time to slaughter those people. Letting that bomb go off gave them time to do it before we got to them. If only I\u2019d shot the girl. It would\u2019ve stopped the bomb... stopped the slaughter... stopped everything.\u201d</p><p>My voice breaks and my head drops into my hands. My eyes are burning so much that I can\u2019t hold them open anymore.</p><p>\u201cThey burned them, Maddy. They burned the bodies. They even burned the ones who weren\u2019t dead yet. I tasted their bodies in the air. I\u2019ll never forget that taste. Or the smell. Or the sounds of the fathers wailing. I\u2019ve never heard men screaming like that. It was... brutal and inhumane and sadistic. And it was my fault.\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes squeezed closed against the terrible memories. The sights, the smells, the sounds. The tiny blood-spattered hands. The burned flesh. The lifeless eyes. The horrible screams.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard men screaming like that,\u201d I repeat limply.</p><p>I fight the urge to heave, even now, my stomach quaking as it rebels against me.</p><p>Maddy buries her face into my shoulder, stroking my back.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d she finally says softly. \u201cYou had no way of knowing what was going on, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>I look at her painfully. \u201cWhen you asked me if there was any way I could\u2019ve stayed in the Rangers... this is why I couldn\u2019t. You can see now, right? I\u2019m seriously fucked up. I can\u2019t trust myself anymore.\u201d</p><p>Maddy\u2019s eyes are full of pain as she looks at me helplessly. \u201cOf course you can, Gabe. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s so focused on everything I just told her, on how sorry she feels for me, that she has forgotten what I\u2019ve just done to her. I reach out and touch the bruise forming across her throat. She flinches backward, then forces herself to remain still.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a monster, Maddy,\u201d I tell her simply. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I mean to be. I am and that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d she snaps at me. \u201cYou are not. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Then why can\u2019t you look me in the eye?</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWhatever I am, I\u2019m a Ranger, Maddy. I\u2019m trained to kill. And in my sleep, when I relive that night over and over, I\u2019m like a fucking runaway train. It seems so real to me, so fucking real. We can\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do when I think I\u2019m in a life-and-death situation.\u201d</p><p>This is why you shouldn\u2019t be with me.</p><p>She shakes her head, still not meeting my gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou might\u2019ve been trained to kill, but you were also trained to protect. You\u2019re a protector, Gabe. You were protecting Mad Dog and Brand and the other three Humvees. You were protecting that little girl when you didn\u2019t want to shoot her. You won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already did,\u201d I insist, staring at the bruise on her neck. \u201cAnd we have no way of knowing if I\u2019ll do it again, Madison.\u201d</p><p>My voice is anguished and rough and full of pain.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she says firmly, finally looking me in the eye. The fear is still there, even though she\u2019s trying to ignore it.</p><p>Because I taught her that fear is a choice. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t know that,\u201d I tell her limply. That\u2019s what I say.</p><p>You need to stay far away from me. That\u2019s what I think.</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d she insists, her voice adamant, yet soft and scared. I have to admire her loyalty, even though it\u2019s misplaced in me.</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly so tired, so very tired. Tired of carrying this weight. Tired of worrying about what I am or what I might do. I\u2019ve already hurt Maddy and that\u2019s the worst possible thing. The only thing I can do now is make sure I never do it again.</p><p>The resolve feels good. It gives me something to focus on.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this in the morning,\u201d I suggest, hating the way those words feel in my mouth. I hate lies. \u201cI want you to rest. This is a lot to take in. And I know your throat must hurt.\u201d</p><p>I pull her close, lifting her into my arms and holding her on my lap. She\u2019s soft and beautiful and trusting, even as she\u2019s afraid.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stay, are you?\u201d she mumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave just as soon as I\u2019m asleep. You\u2019re never going to stay all night again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sounds saddened by this, even though I could\u2019ve just killed her.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, don\u2019t worry about this right now. Just sleep, give your throat a rest. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Guilt, for the thing I\u2019m not saying, weighs so heavily on my chest that I can barely breathe.</p><p>I won\u2019t hurt you because I\u2019m leaving Angel Bay and I\u2019m not coming back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Madison answers quietly, her hand on my chest. \u201cI\u2019m not worried that you\u2019ll hurt me, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>But she is. I know she is.</p><p>Fear might be a choice, but she should fear me. I\u2019m the most dangerous thing in the world to her. If she won\u2019t acknowledge it, then I\u2019ll have to do it for her.</p><p>You\u2019re a protector, Gabe.</p><p>She\u2019s right. I am. And even though she won\u2019t understand it, even though she\u2019ll probably never forgive me, I\u2019m going to protect her now.</p> <p>Madison takes forever to fall asleep tonight, but I don\u2019t mind. I hold her cradled in my lap for hours, long after she has fallen asleep. I watch her, the way she turns to me instinctively, the way her body molds to mine, the soft way she breathes in the night.</p><p>My throat is hot and tight when I finally ease her onto the bed and settle her into the cool sheets. In her sleep Madison is open and trusting, unafraid. It\u2019s the way she should always be. But it\u2019s the way she\u2019ll never be able to be with me.</p><p>Because I\u2019m the scariest thing of all. The bad thing. And she\u2019ll always have reason to fear me.</p><p>But not if I\u2019m not here.</p><p>I stand above her, looking down, unable to swallow the lump that has formed in my throat. Bending, I kiss her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>With long determined strides, I walk from her room.</p><p>I don\u2019t look back.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Madison</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>I\u2019m still in shock as I pull into the Hill\u2019s parking lot, completely oblivious to the beautiful morning around me.</p><p>The sun peeks over the top of the stucco building, making it seem as though it\u2019s glowing. The scenic beauty surrounding me seems like something out of a painting, with the rolling hills along the beach and the water crashing into the sand. It\u2019s nature at its finest.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing matters but what happened last night.</p> <p>As I turn off my car, I glance into the mirror, adjusting the silk scarf knotted around my neck to hide my bruise. Every time I swallow, it hurts. When I talk, my voice is hoarse. It\u2019s a nasty reminder of what happened.</p><p>I\u2019m almost glad that Gabe wasn\u2019t there when I woke up. He\u2019s going to freak out even more when he sees the bruise.</p><p>Gabe.</p><p>I close my eyes, remembering the look on his face last night. The terrifying look of a lethal killer. His eyes were almost black and filled with the single-minded purpose of killing me.</p><p>My heart races as I remember. He thought I was someone else.</p><p>He thought I was a Taliban radical.</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t make my heartbeat slow down. Or my worry disappear. Or my fear go away.</p><p>Fear is a choice, I tell myself silently.</p><p>And last night I was afraid of Gabriel.</p><p>Just like I\u2019ve always been afraid of my father.</p><p>But Gabe isn\u2019t my dad.</p><p>Gabe would never hurt me on purpose. I know that. We\u2019ll just have to fix what is broken. We\u2019ll figure it out. Gabe might think it is, but I know that PTSD isn\u2019t insurmountable. He\u2019s a good man.</p><p>As I envision the twisted lethal look on his face last night, I swallow painfully and remind myself of that again. Gabriel is a good man.</p><p>I quickly pull my phone out and text him.</p><p>Good morning! I missed you this morning. Are you ok?</p><p>A simple good morning will do. I\u2019m not going to lecture him via text message. We can talk about getting help for him later. Tonight, after work.</p><p>I adjust my scarf one more time, then head into the Hill.</p><p>Tony is already here and I stop to talk with him first before I head back to my office. He\u2019s picked up a lot of my slack this week and I owe him a huge thank-you. And maybe a gift card or something.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Madison.\u201d He waves me away as I try to thank him. \u201cI\u2019m only doing my job. I\u2019ll help you in whatever way you need.\u201d</p><p>He goes back to stocking the bar and I head back to my office. It seems as though there is never-ending paperwork in this business.</p><p>I check my phone only to find no answer from Gabe. He must still be asleep, which doesn\u2019t surprise me. He was probably up all night.</p><p>I set my phone aside and bury myself in work. I don\u2019t come out for an hour, when my tiny bladder makes it necessary to take a bathroom break. Before I leave my office I check my phone again, but there\u2019s still no text from Gabe.</p><p>Hell. I really need to hear that he\u2019s OK today. Last night was so intense. I need to hear from him. And I really want to see him.</p><p>I decide to hit the bathroom and then head over to his house. This is something that deserves a calm conversation in the light of day. We need to decide what to do, how best to get him some help.</p><p>We\u2019ve got to do that so we can move forward.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised to run into Jacey in the bathroom because I hadn\u2019t realized that she was here yet. We stare at each other awkwardly for a minute.</p><p>I know I\u2019m the one making it awkward. I haven\u2019t really come right out and told her that Gabe and I are together. And it\u2019s stupid. I need to address it, so after I wash my hands, I turn to her.</p><p>\u201cSo, your brother and I have been seeing each other,\u201d I tell her hesitantly.</p><p>She stares at me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she answers carefully. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Maddy. Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>I am utterly confused as I stare at her solemn, sympathetic face. Gabe told her about last night? I can hardly believe it.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I finally answer, my fingers fluttering unconsciously up to my throat. \u201cI\u2019m OK. It was an accident. He was asleep. He didn\u2019t mean to do it. He feels terrible, so let\u2019s not talk about it, all right? And I definitely don\u2019t want Tony to know.\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me blankly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want Tony to know what? What in the hell are you talking about, Madison? Gabe didn\u2019t mean to do what?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes freeze on my neck, where I can safely assume that my scarf has slipped down. Her eyes widen and she grabs my arm.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck. Did my brother do that?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her numbly, completely confused.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know, then what were you talking about? What are you sorry about, Jacey?\u201d</p><p>She freezes and we stare at each other, the air between us snapping with electricity.</p><p>\u201cWe seem to have a misunderstanding here,\u201d I point out slowly, apprehension building in my chest. \u201cWhat are you sorry about, Jacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... now I\u2019m sorry for two things,\u201d she stutters. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that my brother hurt you. Holy shit, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t... he\u2019s never... I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>I look at her levelly, anxiety causing my fingers to shake.</p><p>\u201cThe second thing, Jacey.\u201d I prompt her out of her daze, terrified to hear the answer. \u201cWhat is the second thing?\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at me and blinks, as though she\u2019s trying to blink away this situation. It\u2019s bad. It\u2019s really bad. I can see it in her eyes and I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to know.</p><p>But she tells me anyway.</p><p>\u201cGabriel left,\u201d Jacey says simply, hesitantly. \u201cHe left this morning.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Jacey, shaking my head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t,\u201d I argue numbly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t. He was with me last night. And he told me everything that happened to him. He wouldn\u2019t leave now.\u201d</p><p>I finger my bruise.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hurt you again.</p><p>His words from last night echo through my head. This is the way he\u2019s not going to hurt me again... by leaving.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I say limply. I want to sink to the floor, to let my shaky knees give way, but I don\u2019t. Instead I walk back to my office and close the door, ignoring Jacey\u2019s questions and her pleas to talk.</p><p>\u201cI need to be alone,\u201d I tell her through the door, before I collapse into my chair and put my head on my arms.</p><p>I feel completely empty, completely in shock. I didn\u2019t see this coming. I really didn\u2019t.</p><p>My insides are empty, cavernous and black. A void. My heart is a void. Do I have a heart after all? Was this even real? Was any of it real? I have the dazed idea that maybe I fell down the rabbit hole that first night at the club after all. Maybe... maybe... maybe... I should pull myself together.</p><p>I open my eyes and stare at the wall, my cheek pressed firmly to the cool wood of my desk.</p><p>All of it is real.</p><p>Gabriel is gone.</p><p>I am here.</p><p>And I suddenly realize that I\u2019ve been scared of the wrong things all along.</p><p>Instead of worrying that Gabriel was a bully or violent or had a bad temper like my dad, I should have been afraid of him for the one thing that could hurt me the most.</p><p>For the one thing that has hurt me the most.</p><p>I should have been afraid of losing him.</p><p>I lift my head and wipe the tears that have streaked down my cheeks and onto my arms. I pick up my phone and try to call him. It goes straight to voice mail. I hang up.</p><p>I stare at the wall, fighting the urge to throw my phone at it.</p><p>Instead I stare at the little screen before I start typing on it.</p><p>You can\u2019t make me love you, then just leave.</p><p>I send the message, even as I realize that it\u2019s exactly what he did. He made me love him and then he left me.</p><p>He. Just. Left.</p><p>Like none of this happened. Like none of it mattered.</p><p>Like I\u2019m nothing at all.</p><p>I add a second text.</p><p>Fuck you, Gabe.</p><p>\u201cOh, my sweet Lord,\u201d Mila mutters, watching me check my phone for the millionth time in two days. \u201cI\u2019m going to freaking kill this guy myself. I\u2019m going to get out of this bed, travel to wherever he\u2019s at, and kill him.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her miserably. I feel like a lovesick teenager, yet at the same time I feel so much more than that. I feel completely crushed, completely empty, completely jilted. Gabe hasn\u2019t even bothered to answer my texts. He hasn\u2019t called.</p><p>He told me everything, his deepest, blackest parts. He made me understand. He made my heart break for him, made me feel his pain... and then he just left.</p><p>Like I\u2019m inconsequential, like I\u2019m not even important enough to think twice about.</p><p>Fuck him.</p><p>That\u2019s what I keep telling my heart. But my freaking heart is so stubborn. It insists on being broken.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Mila insists firmly when a tear streaks down my cheek. I know it unnerves her because I simply don\u2019t cry.</p><p>Not usually.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I say wearily. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do,\u201d Mila answers, her eyes snapping. \u201cI need to know what happened so that I can help. When Pax left me, you made me tell you everything. Now tell me.\u201d</p><p>So I do. I go through everything, from the way I met Gabe, to the way he punched the wall that night, through my fears about the way he handled Jared... to what happened last night. When I\u2019m finally finished, Mila is pale and wide-eyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me see the bruise.\u201d</p><p>Her words are stark, stilted.</p><p>I untie the scarf and let it fall to the floor. Mila gasps, horrified at Gabriel\u2019s purple handprint on my neck.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she breathes. I nod.</p> <p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t even awake. He didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>Mila stares at me doubtfully. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure,\u201d I snap. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. He was asleep. His night terrors are so real that he can\u2019t even tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. He thought I was someone else. He was completely wrecked by it, Mi. And now he\u2019s gone. He wanted to protect me, so he left.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m crying now and Mila reaches over to wrap her skinny arms around me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d she soothes me. \u201cShhhh. Go ahead and cry. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s all going to be OK.\u201d She pats my back and I cry and cry and cry.</p> <p>When I\u2019m done she hands me a Kleenex.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean to do it,\u201d I repeat for good measure, staring her in the eye. She nods slowly, her face expressionless.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cI can see that about him. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he did do it, Maddy. He needs some help. And if he wasn\u2019t going to get that help, then maybe it\u2019s best that he left.\u201d</p><p>My eyes burn, but I don\u2019t cry again.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d I mumble. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s un-helpable.\u201d</p><p>She nods again, solemnly. \u201cI\u2019m sure he does. I remember that Pax was the same way. And what did you tell me?\u201d</p> <p>I turn my face, refusing to answer even though I remember very well what I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell me?\u201d Mila repeats firmly.</p><p>\u201cI told you that he had to get help on his own, that you couldn\u2019t fix him.\u201d My voice is sullen because it seemed so very different when I was dishing out that advice rather than receiving it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were right,\u201d she tells me gently. \u201cAnd I\u2019m right now when I tell you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t leave to get help,\u201d I tell her limply. \u201cHe left for good, to protect me.\u201d</p><p>Mila looks pained, her hand fluttering around to pat my back again. \u201cI know. But maybe it will all work out and maybe he\u2019ll be back. Someday. And everything will be fine. Trust me, when Pax left, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever come back. But he did.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, changing the subject. I just can\u2019t talk about it anymore. Not if I don\u2019t want to break down again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mila,\u201d I tell her tiredly. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to bring you down. You\u2019ve got enough on your plate being stuck in bed. I really just came out here to help with the baby\u2019s room. It needs to be organized and I doubt Pax will know what to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>Mila nods, eyeing me carefully. \u201cWell, that part\u2019s right. Pax has no clue what to do with the baby things. But don\u2019t think you can\u2019t talk to me, Mad. Trust me, I know how you\u2019re feeling right now. If you need to talk again, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell her softly, as I bend and kiss her cheek before I head out the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up, Maddy,\u201d she calls after me. \u201cI mean it!</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. I just walk down the hall to the baby\u2019s room and open the door.</p><p>A flood of sunshiny yellow greets me as light from the windows hits the yellow walls. Pax hired a painter to come in and paint it yellow, per Mila\u2019s request. Since they don\u2019t want to know the sex of the baby, they had to be gender-neutral. And Mila loves the sun.</p><p>Fuck the sun. I hate the sun today.</p><p>I look around at the unopened boxes, at the baby monitors, the stacks of clothing with the tags still on, the stroller still in the box. Pax has ordered all the right supplies, he just has no idea what to do with it all.</p><p>Which is why I\u2019m here. Hopefully it will keep my mind off my own pain.</p><p>I get to work. I put together the changing table in a logical place in the room, next to the mahogany crib. I line up all the little baby care things on the shelf next to it: the powder, the lotion, the nail clippers.</p><p>I hang the mobile over the bed, adjusting the colorful kites so that they\u2019re the right height. I put sheets on the crib mattress. I set up the baby monitor. I fluff the pillows on the rocking chair.</p><p>And then I sit in it and fold the tiny baby clothes so I can put them away.</p><p>As I stare at the tiny little undershirt in my hands, at the way it\u2019s hardly bigger than my hand, my vision blurs as tears fill my eyes.</p><p>I won\u2019t have this... not for a long time. Maybe not ever.</p><p>Gabe left me and I don\u2019t want anyone else. I can\u2019t imagine ever wanting anyone else... so a family, a baby, a husband... a happy life... it\u2019s out of my grasp.</p><p>I close my eyes and just let myself cry again, quietly in the sun... the sun that refuses to leave me alone.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I cry. All I know is that finally I don\u2019t have any tears left. I\u2019m totally spent. My throat feels scratchy and hoarse and my eyes are hot.</p><p>I can\u2019t cry anymore. It\u2019s all gone.</p><p>I open my eyes to find Pax sitting across the room on the delicate white love seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...\u201d I\u2019m startled. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, his hazel eyes troubled. \u201cLong enough. Tell me where he is. I\u2019m going to beat his ass.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, staring at my hands.</p><p>\u201cNot you too. Mila already threatened that. Not that she\u2019s actually a threat. He didn\u2019t mean to hurt me, Pax. He was asleep. Like I explained to Mila, he has PTSD. He honestly didn\u2019t know what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>Pax shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m beating his ass for. I believe that he didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. He\u2019s not that kind of guy. I can tell. What I\u2019m going to beat his ass for is leaving you like this. It\u2019s a dick thing to do.\u201d</p><p>My eyes well up again, even though I thought my tears were all gone.</p><p>One drips down my nose and onto my hand.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never met him at all,\u201d I confess painfully. \u201cI wish he had never come here. Then I wouldn\u2019t feel like this right now. I wouldn\u2019t feel like someone yanked my guts out and put them back in all the wrong places.\u201d</p><p>Pax stares at me, then crosses the room, kneeling next to me with his hand on my back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d he says gently. \u201cYou were closed off before. I don\u2019t know shit about women, but even I could see that. This is horrible, I know. But at least you\u2019re feeling something. You know?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him incredulously. \u201cSeriously, Pax? I would rather feel nothing at all than like this.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m not good with this stuff. All I can tell you is that you should just concentrate on yourself right now. I\u2019m pulling the funding for DefenseTech, so you won\u2019t even have to hear his name. Just focus on yourself. Gabe\u2019s got shit to take care of and it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI know it\u2019s not my fault. And you know what? You\u2019re right. Instead of focusing on him, I\u2019m going to concentrate on working on myself. Lord knows there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d</p><p>Pax smiles slowly. \u201cWell, there\u2019s not that much to do. You\u2019re pretty great, Mad. He has no idea what he gave up.\u201d</p><p>My eyes tear up again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about him anymore,\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard.\u201d</p><p>Pax nods. \u201cI know. I\u2019m so sorry, Maddy. I honestly can\u2019t imagine what happened. Gabe\u2019s a stand-up guy. Trust me, I know assholes and he\u2019s not one. I hope that he can get his shit straightened out.\u201d</p><p>I nod silently. \u201cThat\u2019s not really my problem now,\u201d I finally answer.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say,\u201d Pax replies as he stands up. \u201cI just want to see you happy, Madison. You really do deserve it. You\u2019ve taken care of Mila for so long and I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate that. But that\u2019s my job now and you need to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Pax. Really. I mean it. I do love you, you know. I know you don\u2019t like talking about mushy shit like this, so thank you.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cAnytime. My advice isn\u2019t always good, but it\u2019s free.\u201d At my quick look he adds, \u201cBut in this case it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as I stand up.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll run to the restaurant while Mila naps. I\u2019ll be back with dinner.\u201d</p><p>Pax holds out a fist for me to bump. \u201cAwesome. Mila will thank you. She\u2019s getting pretty damn tired of scrambled eggs, which is the only thing I can cook.\u201d</p><p>I bump his fist limply and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re pretty,\u201d I tell him on my way out the door. I can hear him chuckling as I leave.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel like joking. I honestly don\u2019t. But maybe if I pretend that everything is normal, that everything is OK... maybe it will be.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Fuck you, Gabe.</p><p>I stare at my phone, at the last words from Maddy.</p><p>My gut clenches with every word, more and more, over and over.</p><p>Fuck you, Gabe.</p><p>What the fuck did I do?</p><p>For two days I\u2019ve been asking myself that question. And for two days I haven\u2019t had a good answer. The only thing I know is that I can\u2019t hurt Madison again and this was the only way I knew to protect her.</p><p>But God. God, it fucking sucks. All I want to do is pick up the phone and call her, to check on her... to explain.</p><p>You\u2019re a fucking pussy.</p><p>Because I can\u2019t. If I do, if I hear her voice, I might be tempted to forget all my misgivings and fears about hurting her and rush back to her. Not that she\u2019d likely take me back at this point.</p><p>Fuck you, Gabe.</p><p>How I got myself into this situation, into a place where I love someone even though I know I can\u2019t have her... it\u2019s all my fault. I knew going in that I can\u2019t ever be with anyone. That I\u2019m not whole. That I\u2019m not normal.</p><p>That I\u2019m a monster.</p><p>That I\u2019m the bad thing.</p><p>I knew all of this. And I chased her anyway... because I had to fuck her, I had to harness the storm that I knew she would be.</p><p>And now I love her and everything is fucked up.</p><p>I have no one to blame but myself.</p><p>With a sigh I return my attention to this fucking interview.</p><p>Brand set up some second interviews for an assistant, one who would be based here in Denver since this is where the factory will be. He did the first interviews, so I have to do the second ones. It\u2019s only fair.</p><p>But I overslept this morning and so I had to meet this morning\u2019s candidate in my hotel room, rather than the caf\u00e9 on the main floor.</p><p>As she talks to me, her words run together, her voice fades to the background, and I don\u2019t really give a flying fuck what she\u2019s talking about. My thoughts are in Angel Bay with a gorgeous blonde.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s about it,\u201d the girl, Alex, finishes up, smiling at me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m available to start immediately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, I smile absently as I glance at her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in my hand.</p><p>\u201cOK. Well, I know Brand has already interviewed you, so we\u2019ll talk and then one of us will get back to you.\u201d</p><p>Alex smiles again from where she\u2019s sitting at the table in my hotel room. She\u2019s young and sort of pretty. Her eye makeup is thick and dark, slightly smeared at the corners. Her red lipstick is severe. As I watch, she crosses, then uncrosses her legs.</p><p>Hello, shaved pussy. I can\u2019t believe my eyes. Did she just give me a shot of her crotch on purpose? What the hell?</p> <p>\u201cI really need this job,\u201d she tells me, her voice turning husky and suggestive. \u201cIs there anything I can do to get it?\u201d</p><p>Boom. She did. Fucking hell. It\u2019s like the universe is offering her to me, giving me an opportunity to take my mind off Madison.</p><p>Surely it won\u2019t be that easy.</p><p>But Alex is getting up and moving toward me, her eyes on my lips.</p><p>\u201cI can be very persuasive,\u201d she whispers as she shoves me backward onto the bed, sliding her slim form between my legs.</p> <p>\u201cYou definitely can,\u201d I agree, automatically sliding my hands up her hips. \u201cDid you try and persuade Brand like this?\u201d</p><p>She giggles. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t need to. He told me that he likes me. If you like me, then I get the job.\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>My conscience disappears as the blood flow is redirected from one head to the other.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019d better show me your qualifications.\u201d</p><p>Alex bends her head, kissing me firmly. She tastes like chocolate. It\u2019s foreign, but not unpleasant. I kiss her back.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I finally tell her, and I\u2019m actually not sure if I\u2019m telling her or myself.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHave you looked at yourself?\u201d</p><p>So now she\u2019s appealing to my ego too. Smart girl.</p><p>She reaches down and cups my dick, making it a perfect trifecta. Hormones, ego, dick. She\u2019s got her bases covered. My body reacts like it always does. It gets hard.</p><p>I roll her over and cover her body with mine, sliding my hand up under her short skirt. I should\u2019ve known something was up when she wore such a tiny skirt to an interview.</p><p>I get harder as I slip my fingers into her.</p><p>My thoughts cloud as I move toward an ending that I know will take me away from reality, from stress, from worrying about doing the right thing, from Madison.</p><p>When I do this, I don\u2019t have to think.</p> <p>I just have to feel.</p><p>It\u2019s natural, instinctive.</p><p>Alex moans and I close my eyes. I don\u2019t want to see her. I just want to feel her. I move my fingers inside her deeper, faster. And then I shove her skirt up higher, not bothering to take it off.</p><p>She fumbles to help me, saying my name. The breathy way she says it gives me pause and I open my eyes.</p><p>She\u2019s splayed out on the rumpled hotel bed like an offering, her hair mussed.</p><p>The way she said my name reminded me of Madison.</p><p>I swallow hard, frozen above her, suspended.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks in confusion, opening her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t sound like Madison now. She doesn\u2019t look like her, doesn\u2019t smell like her. Because she\u2019s not Madison.</p><p>She might not be Madison, but in my head that\u2019s all I see. Maddy\u2019s grin, her blue eyes, her gorgeous body. I picture the expression on her face when she was on my lap the other night, loving, soft, understanding.</p><p>Fuck you, Gabe.</p><p>I feel the pulse in my throat as I try to swallow around it. Maddy doesn\u2019t want me. Not anymore and I can\u2019t blame her. And if there\u2019s one way to get one woman out of my head, surely it\u2019s to fuck another one.</p><p>Someone who does want me.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d I finally lie.</p><p>I turn my attention back to Alex and run my fingers along her side, a side that is thicker than Maddy\u2019s. I squeeze my eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI want it hard,\u201d she moans. \u201cFuck me hard, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>A sour taste pools in my mouth, but I ignore it as I drop my head and bury it in Alex\u2019s neck and unfasten my shorts. She grips my shoulders tight, pulling me to her, burying her tongue in my mouth.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t taste right.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t smell right.</p><p>And my dick knows it because all of a sudden I\u2019m not hard anymore.</p><p>I push against her again, but it\u2019s no use. I\u2019m not hard. I\u2019m not going to get hard. Because all I can see in my head is Madison. I roll off and head to the shower without looking back.</p><p>I can hear Alex\u2019s confused questions behind me, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>As the water rushes down over my head and shoulders, I crank the handle all the way over to cold.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I\u2019m in seriously deep shit here.</p><p>A flash of Madison pops into my head again. Her blue eyes, soft and sincere. Her long slender legs wrapped around my hips.</p><p>You\u2019re someone who won\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>I practically groan. I have the feeling I could sleep with a thousand different women in a thousand different hollow fucks and I\u2019d never be able to shake Maddy from my mind.</p><p>If I can fuck someone else, which is apparently questionable.</p><p>What is it about Madison that holds me so tight?</p><p>Everything.</p><p>I groan. Is it possible that I could be with her and not hurt her?</p><p>It\u2019s a moot question since I\u2019ve already left her. But it\u2019s a question that I can\u2019t quite shake.</p><p>The idea of that kind of intimacy sends my stomach up into my throat and I lean my head against the shower wall. That kind of intimacy is terrifying.</p><p>But all of a sudden, for reasons that I can\u2019t understand and can\u2019t explain, being without it is terrifying too.</p><p>After five days, I decide that I fucking hate Denver.</p><p>I fucking hate my life.</p><p>And I fucking hate myself.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure all these feelings are very apparent to everyone around me because I\u2019ve been a total dick.</p><p>Today, after meeting with the potential contractors at the new factory site, Alex and I came back to the table in my hotel room to look through their bids. But I don\u2019t want to be here. There\u2019s only one place I want to be and if I can\u2019t be there, then fuck everyone.</p><p>I rub at my red eyes, trying to ignore the pounding in my head. The whiskey I\u2019ve been using to try to fix my bad attitude has had the exact opposite effect. Hangovers fucking blow.</p><p>Alex hands me some ibuprofen. \u201cHere. This will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I mutter, knocking four of them back with some water.</p><p>For some reason Alex is sticking close by, she gets here early and she stays late.</p><p>It\u2019s like she took my inability to perform with her and my distance and my dickhead attitude as a personal challenge. I can\u2019t figure it out, but then again, I can\u2019t figure out women in general.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think you\u2019ll be here?\u201d Alex asks absently, running her finger along my back. I instinctively move away. She\u2019s been touching me at every opportunity, because she clearly believes that she\u2019s irresistible. She has no idea how much it\u2019s not working for me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer. \u201cAs long as it takes to get everything set up, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go,\u201d Alex pouts, sticking her bottom lip out. \u201cI like having you here.\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to roll my eyes. There\u2019s no way she likes the way I am. I\u2019m onto her. She just wants to sleep with the boss.</p><p>\u201cWell, you knew that I wasn\u2019t staying,\u201d I remind her. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole reason we needed to hire an assistant, so that you could handle day-to-day stuff for us when we\u2019re not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cBut still.\u201d</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>I duck into the bathroom and when I come back out, Alex is standing in the middle of the room, completely nude.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I mutter. Even though I don\u2019t want her, I can\u2019t exactly look away either. She\u2019s naked, for God sake. She\u2019s young and has perfect tits. Before I can even say anything, though, before I can tell her to put her clothes back on, there\u2019s a knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cI ordered room service,\u201d Alex says helpfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously you should take your clothes off, then,\u201d I mutter wryly. What the fuck? I shake my head and grab the bedspread from the bed, wrapping it around her as I head for the door. I open it without even looking and am surprised as hell to find Brand standing in front of me, filling up the doorway.</p><p>He takes in the scene quickly: at the assistant standing naked behind me, the bed rumpled and seemingly used. It\u2019s pretty easy to jump to the wrong conclusion.</p><p>And he does.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Brand exclaims, barging on in. \u201cGabe, what the fuck, dude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d I say by way of explanation. \u201cAnd I thought you were still in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Brand turns to Alex. \u201cAlex, hon, could you give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>She scrambles to put her clothes on, while Brand looks away. \u201cI\u2019ll go down and get a coffee,\u201d she says quickly, not looking back as she darts out the door.</p><p>Brand glares at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Gabe?\u201d He eyes the empty bottle of whiskey on the table. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019ve been holed up here in the hotel getting drunk and banging our new assistant?\u201d</p><p>I glance at the empty bottle. \u201cI\u2019ve only been drinking at night,\u201d I clarify. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not banging the assistant.\u201d</p><p>Brand cocks his head and I can see why he doesn\u2019t believe me, not that any of it matters.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mutter. \u201cThink what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you know that Pax Tate isn\u2019t interested in being an investor now that you fucked over his sister-in-law. We have to get serious and find a new one. We can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re drinking yourself away in this room. And Jesus, we don\u2019t need a sexual harassment suit from our assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the last time.\u201d I grit my teeth. \u201cI didn\u2019t fuck her. I could sue her for sexual harassment, for God\u2019s sake. She practically threw herself at me. Right before you got here, I went to the head and when I came out, she was standing there buck-ass naked.\u201d</p><p>Brand is interested now. \u201cSeriously? Nice!\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cNice? You were just lecturing me on banging the assistant.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cTrue. And I\u2019m glad we don\u2019t have to worry about a harassment suit, but it\u2019s still pretty weird that you passed that shit up. What\u2019s going on, dude? If you want to be in Angel Bay with the leggy blonde, you need to just go. That would solve two problems\u2014your bad disposition and our investor problem. If you go back, Tate would probably invest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want to whore me out for the business?\u201d I smile grimly. He rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI hardly think it would be against your will. What the fuck are you doing, bro?\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s not talking about the business now and I glare at him as I clean up the mess on the table.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care about the women I leave behind?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Brand eyes me. \u201cI don\u2019t. But I do care about you. And I hate watching you fuck up something that was making you happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d I growl as I snatch up an empty beer bottle and hurl it into the trash can. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Brand lifts an eyebrow. \u201cOut of everyone in the world, I think I understand the best. For instance, I know that one of the worst things about leaving the Rangers is feeling like we quit. Even though we know we didn\u2019t quit, that we did it for a very good reason, it still feels like we were quitters. Right?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is that I know, dude. I know what it\u2019s like. And I also know that if you don\u2019t fix this thing with Madison, then you\u2019re quitting again. But for real this time. Don\u2019t do it, Gabe. Clean yourself up and get your ass back to Angel Bay where it belongs.\u201d</p> <p>I glance up at him as I tie my shoes. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you think, then you don\u2019t know shit. Angel Bay isn\u2019t where I belong. And me staying away from Maddy isn\u2019t quitting. It\u2019s protecting her. From me. Going back wouldn\u2019t be doing that very well, would it?\u201d</p><p>Brand sighs, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re one stubborn SOB, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you at least clean up and stop drinking your nights away?\u201d Brand asks wearily. \u201cYou look like a hung-over frat boy. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been meeting with contractors like that.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna work for us, not the other way around. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m flying back to Chicago in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>We sit and look over some contracts, Brand schmoozes with Alex just to make absolutely sure that there won\u2019t be any harassment suits and I stare absently out the window through it all.</p><p>After we eat and wrap up a few last things at the table in my room, Brand heads to his own to pack, since he\u2019s taking the red-eye back to Chicago.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m flying back in the morning.\u201d</p><p>After I close the door, I turn around to find Alex has kicked off her shoes and moved from the table to the bed, where she\u2019s waiting with a come-hither look on her heavily made-up face. I have to fight the shudder that runs through me.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to set my DVR for my favorite show,\u201d she tells me softly. \u201cDo you mind if I watch it here? I don\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d</p> <p>I want to groan, but don\u2019t. I should be polite since I\u2019m leaving in the morning for home anyway.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I tell her, as I drop into a chair next to the bed. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>The problem is that I fall asleep watching it.</p><p>And I wake up to the sound of Alex screaming.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d she shrieks. I sit up and realize that I\u2019m on the floor, dragging myself across the hotel carpet. Alex backs away from me.</p><p>\u201cYou were crawling across the floor, crying for Brand. What the fuck? Are you fucking gay or something? I\u2019m so out of here. You\u2019re a fucking freak.\u201d</p><p>She grabs her purse and slams the hotel door on her way out.</p><p>I\u2019m still dazed, still disoriented, so I sit for a second, rubbing my temples. I never thought it was possible, but the dreams are getting even worse, the dark-eyed, blood-spattered dreams.</p> <p>They\u2019re worse because now Madison\u2019s in them too. She\u2019s lingering on the edge of the dead circle of kids and she\u2019s slipping from my grasp.</p><p>In my head I know that I need to save her, but in my heart I know that I can\u2019t. Because she\u2019s slipping toward the fire, toward the rebels, toward the danger.</p><p>But the danger is actually me.</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p><p>I\u2019m never going to get past this.</p><p>All I want is Madison. She made everything good. She was warmth and light and understanding and trust. She was all of it. And I\u2019ll never have her again. Fuck you, Gabe.</p><p>It\u2019s a bleak fucking thought, and it makes it even harder to shake the nightmare.</p><p>Even after I suck down two bottles of water and have finally settled in bed, I can\u2019t get the taste of ash from my mouth. The ash from the burning bodies. My chest tightens as I try to swallow down the taste of the dead kids. But my stomach doesn\u2019t want any part of it and it lurches rebelliously. I roll to the side and heave onto the floor, retching over and over until there\u2019s nothing left.</p><p>But the taste is still there.</p><p>The ash and the blood. The bleak hopelessness. And now vomit too.</p><p>I wipe my mouth and flip onto my back, my arm across my eyes as I try to breathe, try to settle the shakiness in my legs. Try to push the visions from my head.</p><p>I\u2019m so fucking tired of this.</p><p>So. Fucking. Tired.</p><p>Eyes black as night and full of terror stare at me from behind my eyelids and I open my eyes. I can\u2019t face her anymore. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m completely wrecked and I\u2019m afraid to face what has wrecked me. I\u2019m afraid to face any of it.</p><p>What kind of man am I?</p><p>The kind who fucks up everything and can\u2019t face shit.</p><p>I pull myself up and stumble out onto the balcony, sucking in the cold mountain air, trying to use it to force my lungs open, to inflate them. I can hear the blood pounding in my ears, rush, rush, rushing through my veins, but not air. There\u2019s no air, because I can\u2019t fucking breathe.</p><p>Breathe, motherfucker.</p><p>It\u2019s no wonder that I can\u2019t face shit, because I can\u2019t even breathe. I\u2019m a fucking pussy.</p><p>Gripping the railing, I stare down at the traffic fifteen floors below. People are driving around, minding their own business, honking, breathing, laughing, going on with their lives, even though mine is falling apart.</p><p>Even though across the world, people are dying. They\u2019re bleeding and burning and dying. Life fucking sucks. But no one here knows that.</p><p>They have no idea what life is really like.</p><p>But I do.</p><p>I stare soundlessly down, watching the movement, watching the life, and it is oddly distant from me, so very far away. Up here it\u2019s quiet. Up here it\u2019s removed. Up here there\u2019s only me.</p><p>And I\u2019m fucked up.</p><p>Like the girl\u2019s eyes, my soul is black as night and full of terror.</p><p>I grip the railing and my bicep flexes and I remember the words scrolled across my arm; a brand, a reminder. A creed.</p><p>Death before dishonor.</p><p>The words won\u2019t stop running through my head and I know why. Because I haven\u2019t been acting with honor for months, because I\u2019ve been acting like a goddamned pussy who can\u2019t pull shit together. And I fucked up the only good thing I\u2019ve had. I almost killed her.</p><p>It\u2019s just one more instance of dishonor to add to my list.</p><p>I stare down into the blackness.</p><p>Death before dishonor.</p><p>It would be so easy.</p><p>I know what I have to do. I know what I have to do to get it all to go away, to get it all to end, to get the terrified black eyes out of my head forever. An eye for an eye. Right?</p><p>An eye for a fucking eye.</p><p>A life for a fucking life.</p><p>I swing a leg over the railing, pulling myself onto it, sitting down. My feet dangle and I stare down again. The cars look smaller than my big toe. The fall would kill me. Surely it would kill me.</p><p>And all of this would end.</p><p>The bad thing can\u2019t catch me if the game is over.</p><p>I close my eyes, feeling the light breeze on my face, smelling the mountains. My lungs are working now, which is ironic. In a few minutes I won\u2019t need them anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m not afraid. Fear is a choice and I\u2019m not fucking afraid. I have a plan.</p><p>And because of my plan, I\u2019ll never hurt anyone again.</p><p>The blackness below almost looks inviting, like it\u2019s swirling around my feet, waiting to pull me down. Like once I\u2019m a part of it, it will swallow me up and all my shit will go away.</p><p>That\u2019s what death must be like.</p><p>It\u2019s just an end.</p><p>A rest.</p><p>And God, I\u2019m so fucking tired. I could use a rest.</p><p>I stare at it, at the tempting blackness. Every cell in my body is trained to survive. This goes against all my instincts. I close my eyes and instead of the little girl\u2019s, I see a pair of shining blue ones. Maddy.</p><p>If only I could fix it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Brand\u2019s startled voice breaks apart the blackness and carries out to me through the open balcony door. I glance over my shoulder. Brand is striding through my room, staring at me in shock and horror.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the fear in his voice. I should tell him that fear is a choice, but I don\u2019t. He already knows that.</p><p>\u201cStop right there, Brand,\u201d I tell him woodenly.</p><p>I can hear the lack of emotion in my voice and so he can he. Unlike anyone else, Brand can understand it. He knows what it\u2019s like to face a terrifying mission, and how we have to step away from it, dull ourselves to it, so that we can just do it.</p><p>He can see that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing now.</p><p>He knows.</p><p>His eyes widen and I see the absolute terror in them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Gabe,\u201d he says quietly, stopping in the balcony doorway as I\u2019d instructed. \u201cDon\u2019t. You don\u2019t have to do this. We can fix everything.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, unblinking, disbelieving. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t. That\u2019s bullshit and you know it. Everything is fucked. There\u2019s no fix for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Brand argues, his hands flexing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here anyway?\u201d I ask, not really caring. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cI forget my wallet on the table,\u201d Brand answers. \u201cThank God. Gabe, think about this. Think about Jacey and Maddy. This will kill them. They won\u2019t be able to get over it. You\u2019re all Jacey has because your parents are shitty. Maddy already lost her parents. What do you think this will do to her? Are you thinking of her at all?\u201d</p><p>I swallow, looking away. \u201cShe\u2019s all I think about,\u201d I mutter. \u201cAll of the time. I can\u2019t get her out of my head and it\u2019s killing me, Brand. It\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>Brand stares at me and I see the determination in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cGabe, you chose to end things with Madison. You quit and you didn\u2019t have to. All you have to do is get some help\u2014you didn\u2019t before. But you can now, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, so Brand uses the silence as an opportunity to continue.</p><p>\u201cRemember Mad Dog\u2019s funeral? Do you want them to hand your flag to your parents? Or Jacey? Your parents don\u2019t deserve to have your flag and it would fucking annihilate Jacey. Jesus Christ, Gabe. Get off that railing. You\u2019re not a quitter. You\u2019re not a fucking quitter. Come over here and we\u2019ll deal with this. We\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too much of a pussy,\u201d I answer, my throat closing in hot and tight around my words. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to fix it. I just don\u2019t know how. And I can\u2019t do this anymore, Brand.\u201d</p><p>Brand grits his teeth and takes a step. I eye him warningly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He freezes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a pussy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not a quitter. You\u2019re a badass motherfucker. Tell me what to say to get you off the ledge, Gabe. Tell me and I\u2019ll say it. You and I have been to hell and back together. It\u2019s not going to end like this. You wouldn\u2019t let me end like this and I sure as fuck won\u2019t let you. Not after everything you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I squeeze my eyes shut, letting the blackness seep under my eyelids.

Tell me that you can save that little girl... that you can save all of those little girls.\u201d</p><p>Brand\u2019s breath is ragged and rough. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t save them. But I can save you, Gabe. Get the fuck off that balcony. We can stop your nightmares.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent as I open my eyes and stare down, past my feet, past the cars to the ground. It\u2019s a long way down, but it\u2019s there. Brand follows my gaze.</p> <p>\u201cGabe, I don\u2019t have nightmares much anymore. I swear to Christ. Only once or twice a month. And someday I won\u2019t have any. You just need to get off that ledge and go to therapy like I did. It feels stupid and terrible and dumbass, but it helped me, Gabe. And it will help you. It\u2019s a whole hell of a lot better than this.\u201d</p><p>Better than dying.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at him. \u201cBecause this is the easy way out?\u201d</p><p>Brand stares at me, his eyes a steely blue, determined. \u201cYou said that you\u2019re too much of a pussy to fix it. This is being a pussy, Gabe. Maybe not for some people\u2014because who am I to judge people I don\u2019t know? But I know you. And this is being a pussy for you. Do the hard thing and get your ass off that balcony.\u201d</p><p>I exhale, long and slow, contemplating.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to die. If I die, the bad thing wins.</p><p>Fuck that.</p><p>I take a breath, then grab Brand\u2019s outstretched hand.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Madison</p><p>Gabriel isn\u2019t coming back.</p> <p>I know that now. It\u2019s been a week.</p><p>Seven days.</p><p>One hundred and sixty-eight hours.</p><p>I don\u2019t know where he is and I doubt I\u2019ll ever see him again. It\u2019s a thought that I can\u2019t think about or it will crush me. It still hurts that much.</p><p>Instead I focus on pretending that I\u2019m fine for Jacey and Tony, Mila and Pax. Today Jacey brings me a cup of hot chocolate. Because hot chocolate obviously fixes everything.</p><p>Curling up across the table from where I\u2019m rolling flatware into napkins, she glances at me.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him either, by the way. He probably knows I\u2019m going to bitch him out for what he did.\u201d</p><p>I glance up at her. \u201cCan we not talk about it? Seriously. I just don\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK. That\u2019s fine,\u201d Jacey says quickly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to think that I would hide talking to him from you. I wanted you to know that he hasn\u2019t called.\u201d</p><p>I nod, folding another napkin. \u201cThanks, Jace. I\u2019m sorry for being bitchy. I just... I\u2019m not myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>We sit in silence until the door opens, sunlight flashes on the floor and then Jacey\u2019s face lights up.</p><p>\u201cBrand!\u201d</p><p>She jumps up and runs across the room like she hasn\u2019t seen him in a year. I suck in a breath, not sure if I\u2019m ready to face Gabe\u2019s best friend. Seeing him will just punch me in the gut\u2014make me remember Gabriel. As if I\u2019ve forgotten.</p><p>I don\u2019t turn around, I just keep rolling the silverware, my eyes glued to the task in front of me. But I can hear their low voices and I keep my ears trained in their direction. Brand\u2019s deep voice carries through the restaurant far better than Jacey\u2019s does and I hear it easily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Jace. He feels guilty, of course, for leaving you... and Madison. But he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s going to get a special kind of therapy, something designed to help victims of PTSD. I went through it back when we first came home. It sucks pretty bad, but it\u2019s effective. He\u2019s going to need your support, though.\u201d</p><p>I hear the sound of Jacey\u2019s voice, but I can\u2019t hear her words.</p><p>Brand answers whatever she said.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d understand. PTSD is terrible, Jace. It\u2019s something we can\u2019t control and guys like Gabe and me... well, it\u2019s hard to deal with something like that. He needs all the support you can give him. He\u2019s going to be at Walter Reed this week but he wanted me to check in on you, to make sure that Jared\u2019s still leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>Jacey murmurs something.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck? Why would you do that, Jacey?\u201d</p><p>Brand seems annoyed now and I can\u2019t imagine what Jacey said to him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Just don\u2019t lie to us again, Jacey. You can tell Gabriel when he\u2019s out. Don\u2019t tell him while he\u2019s there. His attention shouldn\u2019t be split. He needs to concentrate on CPT, all right?\u201d</p><p>Jacey murmurs again.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Jace,\u201d Brand continues. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. I know what it\u2019s like. If Gabe has any hope of taking care of this, he\u2019s got to focus on it one hundred percent. You can support the hell out of him when he comes home.\u201d</p><p>Jacey murmurs and then they\u2019re quiet. I\u2019m just getting ready to glance behind me to see if Brand is leaving when his voice pops up by my ear.</p><p>\u201cMaddy?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I slowly turn, looking up into Brand\u2019s blue eyes. \u201cHi, Brand. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really not. Because he\u2019s here and Gabe\u2019s not. And even though that\u2019s irrational, it\u2019s how I feel.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He looks as uncomfortable talking to me as I am listening. \u201cI just wanted to say something, if you don\u2019t mind. Gabriel doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m doing this, but I just wanted you to know that he\u2019s a good guy, Maddy. I know it looks like shit that he left the way he did, but I promise you... he didn\u2019t want to. He got it in his head that you needed protecting. From him. That\u2019s the reason he left.\u201d</p><p>My eyes sting as I nod.</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t take away the fact that he left without saying a word. He hasn\u2019t returned my texts or calls. It\u2019s a shitty thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Brand nods. \u201cI agree. And so does he. I think he can\u2019t trust himself to talk to you. He thinks that if he does, he\u2019ll just come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would that be so bad?\u201d Even I hear how thin my voice is.</p><p>Brand shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But Gabe is dead set on keeping you safe. He misses you like hell, though.\u201d</p><p>My eyes fill up with tears now, so I nod and look away.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I finally manage to say. \u201cThanks for telling me, Brand.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand on my shoulder for a minute and then he\u2019s gone. After a second, Jacey comes back, staring at me in concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d she asks quietly. I nod.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m glad Gabe is getting help. Want to tell me what happened to him that fucked him up so bad?\u201d</p><p>For a minute I\u2019m tempted. But after thinking about it for a minute I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. That\u2019s his story to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you would say that,\u201d Jacey sighs.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Brand annoyed with you about?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you supposed to tell Gabe?\u201d</p><p>Jacey actually looks sheepish. \u201cUm. I lied to Gabe about Jared.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Gabe first got here, I told him that Jared was still texting me and shit. I lied. He wasn\u2019t. He stopped bothering me after that first night that Gabe got in his face here at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, aghast. \u201cThen why in the world would you lie? The whole point was just to get Jared to leave you alone, right?\u201d</p><p>Jacey stares at her hands on the table. \u201cYeah. I just... I missed my brother, you know? And I thought he\u2019d stay longer if he thought that Jared was still messing with me. Which he did. And then he started dating you, so he stayed anyway. It all worked out.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYeah, except Gabe knocked one of Jared\u2019s teeth out because of your lie.\u201d</p><p>Jacey rolls her eyes. \u201cTrust me, he deserved that. He\u2019s an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmur absently. I don\u2019t really care about Jared, to be honest. I don\u2019t care about much at all these days.</p><p>I lug the full bin of newly wrapped flatware to the sidewall and then I retreat into my office, closing the door behind me. I seriously don\u2019t want to deal with people right now.</p><p>After I work on payroll for a while, I click into my e-mail and what I see there sends my heart into my throat.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s name in my in-box.</p><p>I\u2019m barely breathing as I click on the message. I barely breathe as I read the words.</p><p>Dear Madison,</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I know you think I\u2019m an asshole and I guess I probably am, even more so than you know. It\u2019s been killing me not to talk to you and I\u2019m sure you probably don\u2019t want to hear from me now.</p><p>But I wanted you to know that you were right. It wasn\u2019t fair of me to expect you to face your demons when I was unwilling to face my own.</p><p>So I just wanted you to know that I\u2019m facing them now.</p><p>I hope you\u2019re doing alright and that your throat has healed. You have no idea how much it kills me that I did that to you.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what else to say except I\u2019m really sorry, Maddy. I really am.</p><p>\u2014Gabe</p><p>My breath seems caught in my throat as I stare at the page, at the words that Gabe has written. He signed it simply with his name. Not \u201cLove, Gabe.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mention love anywhere, actually.</p><p>He also doesn\u2019t mention the fact that he left me without a goodbye, without an explanation... without anything. He doesn\u2019t mention how he wouldn\u2019t pick up his phone or answer a text. Or even just give me a courtesy e-mail. Even a fucking breakup e-mail would\u2019ve been better than nothing.</p><p>But even now he doesn\u2019t give me an explanation.</p><p>Just a whole lot of \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, I\u2019m sorry too.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m in love with someone who doesn\u2019t love me back.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>After I\u2019m assigned a room in Walter Reed, I sit staring at the wall.</p><p>I want to pick up my phone and call Maddy, but I can\u2019t. She never responded to my e-mail.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t want to hear from me, apparently.</p><p>As I stare at my phone, I am overwhelmed by frustration, by the idea that I\u2019ve been reduced to this... It pisses me off. And when I look in the mirror that is facing me right now, it pisses me off even more to look at myself.</p><p>My anger takes over all of a sudden and I see in a blur of red. My ears roar and I punch the wall next to the mirror as hard as I can. There is a crunch as my knuckles connect with the drywall. That felt surprisingly good.</p><p>A nurse comes running and pokes her head in the door, eyeing me, then the blood dripping from my hand. She raises an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK, soldier?\u201d</p><p>I nod calmly. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. When\u2019s my first session going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute. I\u2019ll get some gauze for your hand.\u201d</p><p>While she\u2019s gone I rinse my hand off in the sink, and I\u2019m toweling it dry when she gets back. She steps into the room with her dark hair wrapped into a bun at the nape of her neck, and spotless nursing scrubs, the perfect picture of efficiency. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sits next to me and dabs at my knuckles with iodine, then wraps then securely with gauze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking to see if there\u2019s a session available this evening,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much you know about CPT, but there are twelve sessions. Some like to do one session a week, others like to do one a day, and still others do two a day\u2014one in the morning and one in the evening. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re a two-a-day type of a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like to just get it over with, so however I can do it the quickest is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>She smiles again. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I can get you into the evening session to kick off your week.\u201d</p> <p>She leaves and I pull out my phone, clicking into my e-mail. I know Maddy hasn\u2019t answered, that she\u2019s not going to answer, but I can\u2019t help but check.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised at the heavy weight on my chest when I see that I\u2019m right.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer and my stomach sinks.</p><p>I guess some part of me, deep down, thought she might. I don\u2019t know why; I guess I thought that if I did the hard thing and came here to this fucking place, she might forgive me.</p><p>But that was fucking dumb. She doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m here.</p> <p>There\u2019s no hope left for Maddy and me.</p><p>Maddy\u2019s there and I\u2019m here and this place is fucking hell. And that begs the question, if she doesn\u2019t care, then why the fuck am I here going through this at all?</p><p>For myself? That\u2019s a weak answer because I don\u2019t really give a flying fuck about myself anymore.</p><p>For Brand? He wants me to make it. And I owe it to him. We\u2019ve invested all our money in the business. It would be a dick thing to do to leave him alone to deal with it. But at the moment that feels weak too.</p><p>Because at the moment nothing seems to matter.</p><p>Everything feels weak.</p> <p>Especially me.</p><p>As I sit sprawled in the folding metal chair in a circle of soldiers with PTSD, I decide that this is definitely the seventh ring of Hell. Everyone is uncomfortable as they sit in the ring, each person trying not to look at anyone else. It\u2019s tense and awkward. I immediately hate it.</p><p>The therapist sits in the middle, perched on a high stool, looking through her notes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got two new soldiers with us today,\u201d she finally says, looking up at me. \u201cOne of them is here for this evening\u2019s session. Lt. Gabriel Vincent. Welcome to the group. I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re expecting with CPT, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing like you think. You are free here to be completely honest, with no fear of embarrassment or shame. Here in the safety of this room, you\u2019re going to realize that whatever it was that you faced in combat wasn\u2019t your fault. With our help, you\u2019re going to come out of this a brand-new man.\u201d</p><p>I nod, unsure of exactly what she expects me to do. I also wonder how she\u2019s able to say that nothing that happened in combat was our fault. That\u2019s bullshit. Sometimes it is someone\u2019s fault.</p><p>She hops off her perch and brings me a clipboard with some papers attached.</p><p>\u201cAs we do our group session, I want you to work on these work sheets. Then we\u2019ll go over your answers at the end.\u201d</p><p>I feel as though everyone is watching me as they begin their regular session and I sift through the papers on my lap. Like they\u2019re trying to figure me out or something. I try to ignore them and get through the dumbass paperwork as quickly as I can.</p> <p>As I read some of the questions, I just want to roll my eyes. What the fuck?</p><p>Please explain the incident that has caused you distress and describe how that incident has made you feel.</p><p>What the fuck kind of question is that?</p><p>Obviously the incident that has brought me here made me feel like shit or I wouldn\u2019t be here in the first place. So that\u2019s what I write. Fuck it. I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat things. She said to feel comfortable being honest, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.</p><p>I scrawl out answers to all the other stupid questions, only half listening to what the other soldiers are saying. That is, until one voice breaks through my concentration.</p><p>A girl.</p><p>As she speaks, I realize that she is talking about being held captive by Taliban rebels. Her eyes keep finding me and she stares at me as she speaks. She\u2019s wearing a uniform, so I know she\u2019s still on active duty. Something about her seems vaguely familiar, but I can\u2019t place it.</p><p>\u201cI was held for nine days in a dirty hovel,\u201d she says, her voice small in this big room. \u201cWe were barely fed, we were abused, and I was serially raped for a week by an entire group of Taliban rebels. I wanted to die. I didn\u2019t know if I even wanted to be rescued because I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be strong enough to survive what had happened. But I wasn\u2019t given the choice. I was rescued. The Seventy-Fifth Ranger Regiment raided the compound and carried all three of us out.\u201d</p><p>The Seventy-Fifth Ranger Regiment.</p><p>Me.</p><p>I suddenly realize why her eyes are vaguely familiar. I\u2019ve seen them before.</p><p>I remember her staring at me in much the same way a couple of years ago, although obviously she looked much different at the time. Her face was filthy and bloody, her fatigues tattered and torn.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have much interaction with her that day, to be honest. I certainly wasn\u2019t the one who carried her out, but my squad was there, as was Brand\u2019s.</p><p>I remember that day. It was one like many others. It wasn\u2019t my mission to retrieve the prisoners. I was in the front, breaking down the doors and eliminating the captors, while several of my men raided the facilities and carried the prisoners out.</p><p>But after we finished the raid and the dust had settled, this girl watched us all from the side, from where the medics were tending her. The other female prisoner was crying, while the male had his head buried in his bloody hands. But not this girl.</p><p>This girl kept her head high and just watched all of us as the medics took her vitals, and poked and prodded her.</p><p>She stares at me now, her eyes lucid and clear.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d she asks quietly. \u201cI was with another nurse and a doctor when we were taken from our Humvee while we were en route to the green zone in Kabul. Your squad is the one that raided the Taliban camp and rescued us.\u201d</p><p>Several soldiers in the circle watch me with quiet interest as I curtly nod.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cI remember. I\u2019ve never forgotten how you kept your head held up high while the others cried.\u201d</p><p>She smiles grimly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how I kept my sanity,\u201d she tells me, her voice painfully thin. \u201cI kept telling myself that no matter what they did to me, they couldn\u2019t take my pride. They couldn\u2019t take my right to be brave or to stare them in the eye as they raped me. They could do their worst, but the only thing I could do was respond with my best. So no matter what they did to me, I looked them in the eye. I didn\u2019t want them to think that they\u2019d broken me.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, at the quiet bravery in the girl\u2019s eyes, shining brightly even now. But something is there, something haunting and sad. Something that makes me ask a blunt question.</p><p>\u201cDid they? Did they break you?\u201d</p><p>She is quiet. In fact, the entire room is quiet. If someone dropped a pin, I\u2019d be able to hear it. I wonder if the question is inappropriate or rude, but the therapist doesn\u2019t interrupt to say that it is.</p><p>Finally the girl nods.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I went through some therapy right after it happened, but I didn\u2019t want to give in and do the full inpatient therapy thing. It made me feel weak, like if I did it I\u2019d be letting them win. But I finally realized that if I let the PTSD control the rest of my life, that would be letting them win. If I keep seeing their faces every night when I go to sleep, that would be letting them win. This...\u201d And she pauses, sweeping her arm in a wide circle around the room. \u201cThis is me winning. This is me kicking their cowardly asses.\u201d</p><p>The other soldiers erupt into applause and I am silent for a moment, watching the group. They all seem supportive and there isn\u2019t a judgmental look on anyone\u2019s face. I realize that I\u2019m not clapping, and so I stand up, clapping hard as I stare into the girl\u2019s eyes.</p><p>When the applause finally dies down, I sit back down and the girl stands up and crosses the circle. When she gets to me, she stops in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI never had a chance to say thank you,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re here... that God has somehow put you in my path so that I can thank you for what you did. You\u2019ll never know how grateful I am to you, and to your men for pulling me out of Hell that day. You saved my life.\u201d</p><p>She stands to attention and salutes me.</p><p>I can\u2019t even express the emotions that flood through me at this moment.</p><p>As a Ranger, I did my job and went back to our camp. I didn\u2019t linger to talk to anyone. Seeing this girl here like this is a reminder that my job had a purpose. And not just any purpose. While a lot of it was ugly and ruthless, we made some lives better.</p><p>We made this girl\u2019s life better.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m not such a worthless fuck after all.</p><p>I get to my feet and return her salute.</p><p>The room explodes into applause again and the quiet reverence is broken.</p><p>The rest of the session passes slowly, but finally it\u2019s time to bring it to a close and everyone straggles out. The army nurse looks as if she\u2019s going to come talk to me, but she\u2019s snagged by another of the soldiers on the way out. That\u2019s just as well. I really only want to go back to my room and go to bed.</p><p>I grab a sandwich from the vending machines and return to my room, snarfing down the dry bread and turkey.</p><p>I collapse onto the bed and stare at the ceiling for a while until I decide that I\u2019m being pathetic, lying here doing nothing. Instead of letting the walls close in on me, I change into workout shorts. I do push-ups and sit-ups simply to get rid of restless energy. After I\u2019ve done five hundred of each, I\u2019m still restless.</p><p>I eye my laptop, trying to fight the urge to boot it up and e-mail Madison.</p><p>Fuck it. She might not want to talk to me, but I sure as hell want to talk to her.</p><p>Dear Maddy,</p><p>I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I miss you.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Gabe</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Madison</p><p>The walls of this house are closing in on me. I stare around at the pictures and furniture and colors... all things that my mother picked out. All things that aren\u2019t mine. It\u2019s time to change that. I\u2019m not going to lie here feeling sorry for myself anymore.</p><p>I curl up on the sofa, pulling the coverlet more tightly around my waist, as I look through furniture catalogues. I need new living room furniture, bedroom furniture, kitchen furniture. Everything.</p><p>Shopping is good for keeping my mind off Gabriel. Because thinking about him is pathetic. And I\u2019m not fucking pathetic.</p><p>I flip open my laptop and order it all, not feeling even a little guilty about spending the money. The Hill turned a profit this year. I can afford it. And I might as well use it on something to change my life, rather than more shoes.</p><p>When the phone rings, my heart leaps, because for just a second I think it might be Gabriel.</p><p>It\u2019s stupid, I know. Because even if he calls, I can\u2019t answer. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting myself out there again for him to stomp on. Fuck. That. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just the same, when I see the Hill\u2019s phone number flashing on the screen, disappointment floods through me and I close my eyes.</p><p>If I can\u2019t talk to Gabe, then I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone today. I let the call go to voice mail as I close my laptop and wander out onto the patio.</p><p>Apparently I\u2019m pathetic after all.</p><p>I sit at the table, staring out at the lake. And even in the midst of the gorgeous views and sounds of the water, all I can do is remember the night Gabe bent me over this table.</p> <p>I close my eyes and remember it... the way his lips brushed over my arched neck, the way he nipped at my shoulder, his voice in my ear, his fingers inside me. The heat of our bodies pressed together in the cold rain. The feel of him inside me as he filled me up.</p><p>I gulp, then close my eyes against the hot tears.</p><p>Don\u2019t fucking cry.</p><p>He left you.</p><p>Don\u2019t fucking cry.</p> <p>I hold my eyes closed for a minute, pulling myself together... and am proud when I realize that not one tear fell.</p><p>I can do this. He didn\u2019t break me.</p><p>After a few minutes I pick up my phone and listen to the voice mail.</p><p>Hey, Maddy. This is Tony. Like I wouldn\u2019t recognize his voice. I smile. Have you heard from Jacey? She didn\u2019t show up for work and she didn\u2019t call.</p><p>Unfortunately that\u2019s not unusual lately. She\u2019s probably sleeping it off from the club last night or something. So I call him back and tell him that, then I click into my e-mail.</p><p>I\u2019m breathless when I see one from Gabe.</p> <p>As I read the words, my heart pounds.</p><p>He misses me.</p><p>My fingers shake as I type out a reply.</p><p>You left me. You made this choice. Now we both have to deal with it.</p><p>I stare at the hateful words and they pull at my heart, twisting it round and round. So I delete them.</p><p>I wish you hadn\u2019t left. But you did.</p><p>Tears fill my eyes as I stare at the new words, as they bleed together as my eyes fill up. Fuck it. I press the backspace hard, deleting the words.</p><p>I miss you, too.</p> <p>Out of all the things I feel, this is the thing I feel the most. But I can\u2019t tell him that. Because then it would make it seem OK that he left, that he treated me like nothing. And that\u2019s not OK.</p><p>I delete the message, my fingers heavy as a stone as I close the laptop.</p><p>If you don\u2019t know what to say, nothing is always a good choice.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Do you feel that you need to be ever-alert, or always on guard?</p><p>Is your opinion of the incident based on fact?</p><p>Are you easily startled?</p><p>Brand wasn\u2019t fucking lying when he told me that this shit sucks. It sucks big donkey balls and every dumbass question that I\u2019m asked pisses me the fuck off.</p><p>Day two is no better than day one was. In fact, it might be worse. The questions that they\u2019re asking me, both in group and in the dumbass individual therapy session, are ridiculous.</p><p>They start out talking about the seemingly innocuous questions from the work sheets, but that evolves into talking in depth about whatever incidents put us here, the things we fear the most.</p><p>It\u2019s like a sticky therapeutic web of bullshit.</p><p>I am dejected as I walk back to my room after my individual session. I don\u2019t feel like going to the cafeteria for dinner, so I\u2019ll grab something from the vending machine later.</p><p>The first thing I do after I close my bedroom door behind me is check my e-mail. As I punch my password in, I realize that I\u2019m holding my breath... I want to see Maddy\u2019s name. But there\u2019s nothing but a note from Brand.</p><p>Gabe,</p><p>Day two really sucks, I remember. Hang in there. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s worth it or that it\u2019s working, I know. But trust me, it will. Just keep your chin up, bro.</p><p>\u2014Brand</p><p>I appreciate Brand. I do. But all I wanted was to see an answer from Maddy. And the lack of one is an answer in itself.</p><p>I fucked up and I\u2019ve lost her. Losing her feels every bit as bad as everything I went through in Afghanistan. Every fucking bit. And there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.</p><p>My stomach growls, so I close down my computer and venture out to the commons area where the vending machines are. I choose a sub sandwich and chips before turning around and finding Annie the army nurse behind me, holding a handful of quarters.</p><p>\u201cSo, today sucked, right?\u201d She glances up at me. \u201cIt was day two for you, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, knowing that she has no fucking clue exactly how bad it was for me. \u201cYeah. It seemed pretty pointless. My friend e-mailed me and said that it will get better. Or it\u2019ll at least seem like it has a point soon.\u201d</p><p>Annie nods in agreement. \u201cYeah, it does. It doesn\u2019t get any easier, but it will at least make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many sessions do you have a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one,\u201d she tells me as she feeds her quarters into the machine. \u201cI\u2019m on light duty here at the hospital during treatment, so I have a shift that I have to work around. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo a day,\u201d I answer. \u201cAnd right now it seems pretty pathetic. But here\u2019s hoping that tomorrow will be better. \u2019Night, Annie.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Night,\u201d she calls after me.</p><p>I can feel her watching me as I walk away. Her attention makes me a little uneasy, since I don\u2019t know exactly what she wants from me. I feel like she\u2019s almost put me on a pedestal, since I was with the team that rescued her. And I sure as hell don\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>After I eat my sandwich, I open my e-mail one more time, not breathing as I look. But I release my breath on a slow exhale.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing. My in-box is empty.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Madison</p><p>I finish the call with the contractor I hired to work on my house and Tony stares at me from the chair in front of my desk.</p><p>\u201cYou using Mathis and Son?\u201d He raises an eyebrow. \u201cBecause I know Derrick Mathis. Tell him to give you a discount.\u201d</p><p>I smile, in spite of the way I don\u2019t feel like smiling yet.</p><p>\u201cI know him too,\u201d I remind Tony. \u201cTrust me, he\u2019s giving me a good deal. He\u2019s painting every room in my house and laying new floor and tile, and he\u2019s doing all of that work in one week\u2019s time. Once I decided to do it, I just wanted it done. Like now. So he\u2019s sending in several teams to get it taken care of. I\u2019m going to stay with Mila and Pax for a few days while it\u2019s being done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d Tony nods, his burly hands flipping through the work schedule. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta talk about Jacey, Mad. This is the second day in a row she hasn\u2019t called in. What the hell is up with her?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. I texted her last night and didn\u2019t get an answer... and that always means that she\u2019s doing something she knows I wouldn\u2019t approve of.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s find out.\u201d I sigh again as I pick up the phone. I dial her number and it rings five times. I\u2019m just thinking it\u2019s going to voice mail when she finally answers, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Maddy,\u201d she says brightly, as if she hasn\u2019t been MIA for two days. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d I answer sternly. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed work two days in a row. What the hell, Jacey? I need you here. Business is picking up for the season and I need a full staff.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause and a rustle and a voice in the background.</p><p>A man\u2019s voice. A familiar man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I demand suspiciously. \u201cI know that\u2019s not who I think it is.\u201d</p><p>Another pause, pregnant and long.</p><p>I feel the blood boiling, up into my ears, spilling out into my cheeks, flushing them bright red.</p><p>\u201cJacey, what the fuck is Jared doing at your house?\u201d</p><p>Tony snaps to attention in front of me, scowling at the phone. He holds his hands up to question Jacey\u2019s motives and I shake my head.</p><p>I have no idea, I mouth to him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jacey finally sighs. \u201cI know you\u2019re mad and Gabe will be mad, but Jared came to see me the other night and he apologized for everything. He was only being an ass because he missed me so much, Mad. Deep down he\u2019s a good guy. He just needs to change some things. He really does love me.\u201d</p><p>Oh. My. God. My stomach drops into my toes and I can\u2019t even think.</p><p>\u201cJacey, he does not. He only cares about himself. I know you have acceptance issues. But you don\u2019t need his acceptance. He\u2019s an asshole. He\u2019ll always be an asshole. He\u2019s not going to change that. And isn\u2019t he pissed that you lied about him to Gabe? I would think he wouldn\u2019t just forget that.\u201d</p><p>Tony is standing now, a thunderous cloud above me. He can\u2019t believe this shit any more than I can.</p><p>\u201cI apologized for that,\u201d Jacey says weakly. \u201cHe understands that I was just messed up. That I missed my brother.\u201d</p><p>My head falls back and I stare at the ceiling as I count to ten, breathing heavily.</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d Jacey asks hesitantly.</p><p>Eight.</p><p>Nine.</p><p>Ten.</p><p>I take another breath.</p><p>\u201cJacey, I love you. But you\u2019re seriously fucked up. If you need attention this bad, so bad that you would run right back to a psychopathic asshole, then you need some serious help. I love you. You\u2019ll always be my best friend. But you\u2019re fired. I have to have someone here that I can count on to come in when they\u2019re scheduled. When you get your head on straight, you can come back.\u201d</p><p>She protests, but I hang up on her.</p><p>Tony and I look at each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I shrug. \u201cSometimes you gotta use a little tough love. This is really stupid. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s doing this. And I can\u2019t even tell Brand and Gabe because they\u2019re gone. I could e-mail Gabe, but I know he doesn\u2019t need this shit right now. Not while he\u2019s at Walter Reed.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Tony as angry as he is right now, his big hands clenching into fists as he stands over me, his mouth contorted into a grimace.</p><p>\u201cText her and tell her to stay put. I\u2019m going over there to talk to her. She needs a swift kick in the ass, and I\u2019m just the person to do it,\u201d he tells me as he heads out the office door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get into it with Jared,\u201d I call after Tony. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>I jump up and run after him.</p><p>He turns and looks at me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m only going to talk to Jacey. And to kick that little punk out of her house.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. That\u2019s what I was afraid of.</p><p>But there\u2019s nothing I can do but watch as Tony lumbers out the door.</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>From what you\u2019ve described to me, you killed an innocent person who was sent to kill you in a coordinated effort to kill a hundred other people. Tell me, Gabe. Do you really feel like you murdered that girl\u2014or all those other girls and women? YOU. Not the US military, not your unit, not the girl\u2019s uncle... but YOU?</p><p>I want to punch my therapist\u2019s fucking teeth down his fucking throat. This individual session has lasted three hours today, three grueling hours.</p><p>So far, over the last three days, I\u2019ve had to write about what happened, talk about what happened, and think about what happened. In depth. In a way that I haven\u2019t made myself examine it, ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But this morning I had a breakthrough.</p><p>I realized that one thing is the root of my issue. I can deal with the fact that Mad Dog died, even though I feel like I should\u2019ve prevented it. I\u2019ve seen other men die before and I had to deal with it.</p><p>What tortures me the most is the thing that gives me nightmares.</p><p>The girl.</p> <p>She needed my protection and I failed her. I killed her instead of helping her. Because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to help in the split second that I had to make a decision.</p><p>I failed.</p><p>That\u2019s the crux of it. I wasn\u2019t trained to fail. But because I failed, people died, and I can\u2019t get past that guilt. The girl symbolizes my failure to me.</p><p>Once we make that discovery, Dr. Hart, my therapist, makes me talk about everything I know about her.</p><p>Her name was Ara Sahar. The army told me that.</p> <p>She was ten years old. The army told me that too.</p><p>Her uncle was a Taliban rebel who kidnapped her and sent her to destroy my Humvee. Yet another thing the army told us.</p><p>She was terrified and needed my help. No one had to tell me that, I saw it in her eyes. And that\u2019s what I can\u2019t forgive myself for. I didn\u2019t see the other girls and women while they were still alive. But I saw Ara Sahar.</p><p>\u201cUntil you forgive yourself, you aren\u2019t going to move past this,\u201d Dr. Hart tells me solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind of thing a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him with a heavy, heavy weight on my chest.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to forgive myself for failing a child?\u201d I ask him painfully. \u201cFor failing a hundred children? If you were me, could you? If you would\u2019ve smelled them burning, could you forget that?\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Hart stares at me thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, I would try to think of something, anything, I could do that would give me peace. Sometimes we just have to trick our minds into believing what we tell it. Have you ever considered writing Ara\u2019s parents a letter? Explain what happened, then ask for their forgiveness. I\u2019m sure the army can help us figure out where to send it or tell us if her parents are even still alive.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. The idea of even talking to that girl\u2019s parents sends my stomach plummeting into my shoes. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m the last person they want to hear from.</p><p>But maybe they do deserve an explanation. An apology.</p><p>At the very least.</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>The therapist pushes a notepad and pen toward me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your homework,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>I stare at him rigidly before I finally sigh and take the notepad.</p><p>That night, as I sit in the darkness of my room, I stare at the blank page for at least an hour before I can think of what to say. Finally, I start scrawling.</p><p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Sahar,</p><p>You don\u2019t know me, but something I did has changed your lives... and mine.</p><p>My name is Lt. Gabriel Vincent and until recently, I was a United States Ranger. I was with the convoy that was involved in the Humvee explosion that killed your daughter.</p><p>I\u2019m looking at the words that I just wrote and they are very black-and-white\u2014very matter-of-fact. But in reality, what happened is far from black-and-white. I think about your daughter every day. Every day, I wish I could have stopped what happened, that I could\u2019ve helped her. Every day, I hate myself for not being able to.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say to you except that I\u2019m very, very sorry. Sorrier than you\u2019ll ever know. I doubt that I\u2019ll ever be able to forgive myself for what happened, so I can hardly ask you for forgiveness. So I won\u2019t. But I do need for you to know that if I could change what happened that night, I would.</p><p>I am very sorry for your loss.</p><p>My deepest condolences,</p><p>Lt. Gabriel Vincent</p><p>US Army Rangers, Seventy-Fifth Regiment</p><p>I read and reread the letter, then finally decide that there\u2019s nothing else I can say. I fold it up and stick it back in the notepad to give Dr. Hart tomorrow.</p><p>And then I think about Maddy. Thinking so much about forgiveness makes me think about her. Out of everyone, she\u2019s the one I should beg forgiveness from the most. I made her trust me, then I just left. It must\u2019ve crushed her, a thought that crushes me.</p><p>My fingers fly across the keyboard and I don\u2019t care if I look weak or like a pussy. I just need her to know, to really know, that I\u2019m sorry. Even if she can never forgive me, I want her to know.</p><p>Dear Maddy,</p><p>I just wrote a letter to the girl\u2019s parents... the Afghan girl. And it made me realize something. I haven\u2019t asked you to forgive me for leaving you the way I did.</p><p>I promise you, I only wanted to protect you... from me. I hurt you, Maddy. I could have killed you. But when I left you without an explanation, I know that hurt you too.</p><p>You didn\u2019t deserve to have me come into your life and stomp on it. I\u2019m so sorry for that. I\u2019m sorry that I offered you something that I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014because at the time, a life with me just wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>I\u2019m here now at CPT, hoping... praying... that they can pick up all the wrecked pieces and put me back together again.</p><p>But it fucking sucks here. I hate it and every day I don\u2019t even know if I can stay. The therapy sort of breaks us back down so that they can build us back up, teaching us the right way to deal with shit. It\u2019s terrible.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry for dumping that on you. I miss talking to you.</p><p>All I really wanted to say was that I\u2019m sorrier than you\u2019ll ever know. And that even though I don\u2019t deserve it, I hope that you can forgive me for hurting you.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Gabe</p><p>I feel completely wiped as I close the lid of my laptop. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve touched upon every emotion that I\u2019ve ever had today and I decide that I have time for a nap before my last session of the day.</p><p>As I drift into sleep I see Ara Sahar\u2019s dark eyes. She\u2019s watching me curiously, but there is no blame on her face right now, which is a break from the usual.</p><p>But the nightmares still come.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Madison</p><p>As I wait for Tony to come back, I idly scroll through the Internet on my phone, avoiding the urge to check my e-mail. Something, deep down, tells me that I might find an e-mail from Gabe.</p><p>And if he keeps e-mailing me, I just don\u2019t know how long I can resist answering him.</p><p>I miss him.</p><p>I miss him.</p><p>God, I miss him.</p><p>But I can never open myself like that again. When I do I just get hurt and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going through this again. Ever. The Band-Aid has been ripped off now, the worst part is over. I just have to stick it out.</p><p>But I\u2019m weak.</p><p>Not two minutes later, I check my e-mail.</p><p>And I was right. There\u2019s a message from Gabe.</p><p>My heart beats loudly in my ears as I read each painful word.</p><p>Oh my God. Reading that he thinks he\u2019s wrecked almost wrecks me. No matter what he did to me by leaving, I can\u2019t deny that he\u2019s strong and brave... and hearing him like this makes my heart break. Seeing that he wants my forgiveness makes my heart ache.</p><p>I hit the Reply button and hesitantly type, You are strong enough. That\u2019s it. No \u201cDear Gabe\u201d or \u201cLove, Madison.\u201d</p><p>My finger hesitates above the Send button, shaking. I don\u2019t know whether to send it. I don\u2019t want him to quit. He needs the help. I honestly want him to be whole again. Even if I can\u2019t be with him, he needs to be whole.</p><p>My finger twitches.</p><p>And then my phone rings, interrupting me.</p><p>Jacey\u2019s number flashes on the screen and I roll my eyes. She\u2019s the last person I want to talk to right now. Seriously. If she wants to be so stupid, I can\u2019t sit around and watch her do it.</p><p>But even still. As I glance at the phone, as I look at her name, something in me says to answer it. That I need to answer it.</p><p>I pick up the phone hesitantly.</p><p>And my ear is instantly filled with Jacey\u2019s screaming.</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Screams fill my ears once again, just like they do whenever I remember that fucking night. I stare at the paper in front of me.</p><p>So if everything was your fault, how could you have stopped it? Let\u2019s work through this. Write down on that piece of paper every single thing you could have done to prevent Ara Sahar and Mad Dog\u2019s deaths... or the deaths of the girls and women in the village. Because the way I see it, there was never a way to save them. Try and prove me wrong.</p><p>The blank whiteness of the paper mocks me, as my pen lingers motionless above it. I listen to the tick of the clock and I stare at my shoes. Finally I scribble out an answer.</p><p>I fucking hate this shit. The therapist is just going to tear my answers apart in the morning.</p><p>A soft rap on the door interrupts my homework, thankfully. I answer it to find the army nurse.</p><p>\u201cHey, soldier,\u201d she greets me with a grin, as she tosses me a cold soda. \u201cHow was your session?\u201d</p><p>I practically growl a response as I drop back onto the bed, cracking the soda open and taking a gulp. \u201cI hate this shit.\u201d</p><p>Annie perches in the chair, her combat boots shined to a perfect gleam.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she answers sympathetically. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hate it the whole time. But I\u2019ve gotta tell you. It does help. All the questions they ask actually have a purpose. They get us thinking in ways we didn\u2019t before. I\u2019m still having the nightmares, but they don\u2019t last all night long. I\u2019m still jumpy, but I don\u2019t look over my shoulder as much. We might actually do this, soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a soldier anymore,\u201d I tell her as I scribble another answer onto the work sheet. She rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as I do that you\u2019ll always be a soldier. It\u2019s in your blood.\u201d</p><p>And it is.</p><p>It feels good to sit and talk with someone who gets that. Brand gets it, but we don\u2019t talk about it. Men just don\u2019t.</p><p>Annie glances at me. \u201cDo you ever miss it?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to roll my eyes now. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>She grins. \u201cI\u2019d miss it like hell. When I first came back, my parents begged me to resign my commission, to come out into civilian life and be \u2018normal.\u2019 As if that was going to happen. I\u2019m a soldier. I\u2019ll always be a soldier. I can\u2019t imagine turning in my boots.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like a sucker punch because I did turn in my boots.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has to do what is best for them,\u201d I finally answer. \u201cI had to resign because that was best for me and best for my squad.\u201d</p><p>Annie nods understandingly and I know that she does, in fact, understand. She can\u2019t possibly know what it was like to be a Ranger or to resign from the job that I dreamed my entire life of having, but she knows what it\u2019s like to be a soldier to the bone.</p><p>That kind of understanding makes it easy to relate to her. And easy for her to relate to me. She glances up at me, her hands fidgeting in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI want to thank you again for being here,\u201d she finally says. \u201cNot only so that I can thank you again for what you did for me, but you\u2019ve reminded me of a couple things. Important things.\u201d</p><p>I raise an eyebrow. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Annie gets up from her chair and drops down next to me on the bed, something that puts me instantly at unease. What the fuck? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reminded me that there are strong guys out there who know what the fuck I\u2019m going through because you\u2019re going through it too,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>As she speaks, she slides her hand softly onto my arm. I freeze as I realize what is happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also decided that everything happens for a reason,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhat are the odds that you would be there that day in the squad that rescued me and you would be here when I come to get help?\u201d She pauses for a brief second. \u201cThe odds are slim to none, Gabe. I think I was meant to meet you. I really do. The question is... what are we going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>Before I can think about what she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s leaned into me, pressing her lips softly to mine.</p> <p>I am utterly frozen as she kisses me. I didn\u2019t see this coming, I truly didn\u2019t. I thought we were just commiserating about our issues.</p><p>Her hands come up and clutch my back and for a moment, one moment, I think about it. It would be so easy to slip away into that vague place where sex takes me, to that place where nothing matters anymore. It would be the easiest thing in the world. And I need someone. I need to be comforted by someone.</p><p>But she\u2019s not the person I need.</p><p>I\u2019ve already tried this road with Alex and it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>I don\u2019t want anyone else.</p> <p>I grip Annie\u2019s upper arms gently and push her away, looking into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, you don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d I tell her firmly. \u201cYou don\u2019t. You\u2019re emotional because of this place. It\u2019s OK, I\u2019m sure it happens to everyone.\u201d</p><p>She scowls at me, then she reaches for me again.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not this place. It\u2019s you, Gabe. I just want you. You make me remember what I like about the world. You make everything make sense.\u201d</p><p>After knowing me for a few days? I look at her questioningly as I hold her at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, think about what you\u2019re saying. I can see where you would think that we have a connection because we both have the same shit going on. But think about that...we have the same shit going on. We\u2019d be a train wreck. We each need someone outside of this mess, someone who can keep things in perspective for us... someone to give us a reason to pull out of this. I heard you telling one of your other friends about your boyfriend at lunch the other day. You need to tell him everything that you\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p> <p>Annie starts crying now, big fat tears that roll down her cheeks in black streaks from her makeup. Fuck. I hate this shit. I never know what to do. I awkwardly pat at her back.</p><p>\u201cAnnie, don\u2019t cry. Everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. This is just a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>She continues to cry, then reaches for me, burying her head into my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I misunderstood and wrecked everything. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pat at her again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t wreck anything, Annie. It\u2019s a misunderstanding. Our emotions are all jacked up in here. You don\u2019t have anything to apologize for.\u201d</p><p>She nods and sniffs and slips from the bed to the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gabe,\u201d she sniffles again before she leaves.</p><p>I am still shaking my head as I watch her go.</p> <p>What the fuck was that?</p><p>As I calm down and gather my thoughts, I realize that as uncomfortable as that situation was, it did one thing for me.</p><p>Because when Annie looked at me, accepting all my flaws, overlooking them because she wanted to sleep with me, it made me realize why I\u2019ve sought out women ever since the incident.</p><p>Their acceptance comforts me.</p><p>But it\u2019s momentary.</p><p>Temporary.</p><p>For just a minute it soothes my guilt. I slip into oblivion, into a place where I\u2019m not judged. They accept me for what I am. That\u2019s why I sought out the prostitute in Kabul, that\u2019s why I almost slept with Alex.</p><p>But I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019ve accepted what I did to Ara Sahar. I\u2019ve accepted why I did it. And because of that, I don\u2019t need to seek out a substitute for that acceptance anymore.</p><p>I need the real thing.</p><p>Something permanent.</p><p>That\u2019s huge.</p><p>Stunned, I sit with my shoulders slumped, my hands in my lap, just thinking about it. I tried to sleep with Maddy for the very same reason I slept with everyone else. But I fell in love with her instead.</p><p>And now she\u2019s all I want.</p><p>I pick up the phone.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Madison</p><p>Another call beeps in as I try to figure out what Jacey is screaming about, but I don\u2019t even look. All I can do is try to make sense of what she\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cJacey, slow down. I can\u2019t understand you,\u201d I tell her quickly. \u201cTake a breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmyGodMadison,\u201d she shrieks. \u201cOhmyGod... ohmyGod.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s frantic and she won\u2019t listen and it turns my hand clammy as I grip the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I finally yell. \u201cJacey, what is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tony,\u201d she finally manages to say. \u201cJesus Christ. Maddy, you\u2019ve got to come. We\u2019re at that curve on your street. The one... the nasty one.\u201d</p><p>The one where my parents died. My heart stops.</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d Jacey wails. \u201cJust get here.\u201d</p><p>I hear a siren, then I hear nothing.</p><p>I can\u2019t even feel my fingers or think as I grab my purse and rush out the door. I don\u2019t notice the drive. I don\u2019t register the red lights or stop signs or anything else. I\u2019m on autopilot as I drive, as I distance myself from my heart so I don\u2019t feel so much of what is going on.</p><p>It\u2019s nothing bad, I tell myself as I get closer. It\u2019s nothing bad. He has a flat tire. He had a fender bender. He slid off the edge just like I did a few weeks ago. It\u2019s nothing bad. He\u2019s fine.</p><p>He\u2019s fine.</p><p>He\u2019s fine.</p><p>He has to be fine.</p><p>Nothing can be wrong with Tony, because he has to be fine. He holds my life together. He holds my family together and he holds the Hill together. He picks up my slack. He picked up my father\u2019s slack for years. He became my father, in a way.</p><p>He\u2019s fine.</p><p>But he\u2019s not.</p><p>He\u2019s not fine. I know it before I get there. I know it from the dead feeling in my heart. I know it as I pull up and see his truck, crumpled on the side of the road. I know it when I see the ambulance and the fire trucks and the grave looks on everyone\u2019s faces. I know it when I see the stretcher, with the still form on it, covered up with a sheet. I know it when I see the tip of his boot sticking out from under the sheet.</p><p>He\u2019s not fine.</p><p>And I\u2019m not either.</p><p>My legs give out and I crumple to the ground. As I go down, I take in the rest of the scene. I see Jared in handcuffs, I see Jacey\u2019s tear-streaked face rushing for me. I see EMTs lunging toward me.</p><p>And then I don\u2019t see anything at all.</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Maddy didn\u2019t answer the phone.</p><p>I listen to it ring and ring, then her voice picks up on the voice mail. I listen to the entire message, savoring the sound of her voice, but when the beep comes, I can\u2019t speak. She doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. I won\u2019t force her to listen to me.</p><p>With a sigh I head down to a group session, sitting on the opposite side of the room from Annie. She tries to catch my eye a few times, but I ignore it. I\u2019m not mad at her, but I don\u2019t want to deal with her right now. I\u2019ve got enough to worry about without more drama.</p><p>Instead I focus on the paper in front of me. On answering this shit so that I can just go through it all in person in individual therapy tonight.</p><p>I wish you could\u2019ve prevented that incident, too. But I\u2019m hearing a definite turnaround in the way you\u2019re speaking about it, Gabe. Instead of saying, \u201cI should\u2019ve stopped it,\u201d you\u2019re now saying, \u201cI wish I could have stopped it.\u201d Have you noticed that? How does it feel to realize that it was out of your hands?</p><p>How does it feel? Last night was the first night in a year that I didn\u2019t have continuous nightmares.</p><p>After individual therapy last night, I crashed hard and when I woke up an hour ago, it took me a minute to realize why I felt so well rested.</p><p>Because I actually slept. It\u2019s a fucking amazing feeling. I\u2019d forgotten what that felt like.</p><p>I also realize that my therapist was right. I think I really have shifted the blame for what happened away from me. I mean, in my head I always knew it wasn\u2019t my fault. But heads and hearts don\u2019t always agree; and my heart was guilty as hell.</p><p>It\u2019s not so guilty anymore.</p><p>Not about that, anyway.</p><p>Guilt about Maddy is still alive and well, though. But I know that can\u2019t be resolved here. It can\u2019t be resolved at all, not if she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. Sessions today don\u2019t seem as grueling as normal, probably because I\u2019m used to them now, but also because the end is in sight. I only have one more day, then I can leave tomorrow.</p><p>But then what?</p><p>What will I do then?</p><p>Do I have the balls to go back to Maddy, to try to explain? Because for the first time, I feel like I might really beat this. And if I can, I know that I\u2019d never hurt her again...</p><p>But if she won\u2019t even talk to me, then there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019ll listen to me try to explain.</p><p>All I know is that the void I feel without her is huge. I hadn\u2019t realized what a big part of my life she\u2019d become until she suddenly wasn\u2019t there anymore this week. And there\u2019s no way that I want to continue like this. No fucking way.</p><p>I finish up my session and make my way back to my room, ignoring Annie\u2019s voice calling for me down the hall.</p><p>I can\u2019t deal with her right now.</p><p>I\u2019m on the way to my laptop, to send Maddy another note, when my phone rings on the dresser.</p><p>Brand.</p><p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t want to interrupt your therapy, but there\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to know. When you leave in the morning, you\u2019ve got to come back to Angel Bay.\u201d</p><p>Before I can protest or argue, he continues, his voice grave.</p><p>\u201cTony, the bartender from the Hill, is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, incredulously. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Brand sighs, long and loud. \u201cLong story. But it involves Jacey.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe apparently went back to that little fuck Jared. I don\u2019t know the details, but Tony went out to talk some sense into her and Jared ran him off the road. He died at the scene.\u201d</p><p>Like Madison\u2019s parents.</p><p>That\u2019s the only thing I can think of for a minute.</p><p>\u201cIs Jacey all right?\u201d I ask calmly. \u201cWas she there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s fine. And yes, she was there. She went with Jared to try to defuse the situation and she couldn\u2019t stop him. She\u2019s pretty shaken up, but she\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jared?\u201d My voice is wooden.</p><p>\u201cIn jail.\u201d</p><p>Pause.</p><p>\u201cAnd Maddy?\u201d</p><p>Brand\u2019s voice softens. \u201cJacey says that Maddy\u2019s a wreck. She won\u2019t even talk to Jacey right now. Apparently that guy was a like a father to her and she\u2019s taking it hard. She was at the scene too. You need to come home, Gabe. I think she needs you. And I know Jacey does.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there tomorrow,\u201d I tell him. \u201cTell Jacey I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Maddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, Brand.

She\u2019s had to deal with so much loss in her life\u2014including losing me.</p><p>This isn\u2019t fucking fair.</p><p>But life isn\u2019t fucking fair.</p> <p>All I want to do is to grab my stuff and leave.

Maria just stares at me in shock.</p><p>Tony\u2019s been a part of my life for years.</p><p>He\u2019s family.</p><p>This is the only thing I can do for him now.</p><p>The last thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want,\u201d I assure Maria as she cries in gratitude. \u201cHe was like a father to me, Maria. Mila too. He was always there when we needed him the most. It\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d My voice breaks and a lump forms in my throat and I know from experience that it\u2019s going to be weeks until I\u2019m able to swallow it.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to swallow when your throat is full of pain.</p><p>Even though I can hardly think through my shock and grief, I help Maria make decisions, because I know that everything I\u2019m feeling is amplified a hundred times in her. And poor Sophia is curled up in a ball on her bed, unable to process anything.</p><p>I know how it feels. I feel like I\u2019m walking around in a haze.</p><p>But there are decisions to make.</p><p>An urn.</p><p>Crematory arrangements.</p><p>Flowers.</p><p>Hymns.</p><p>An obituary.</p><p>All the things that a funeral needs, we have to decide on. I can\u2019t even believe that I\u2019m doing this again. First my parents... and now Tony. It\u2019s just too much. And then Jacey calls right in the middle of it. Right when I\u2019m overwhelmed with everything.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Maddy,\u201d she begs tearfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. I loved Tony too. I had no idea that Jared was going to do that. I thought he was different. I thought he was changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, shut up,\u201d I snap at her as I walk onto the front porch. \u201cI can\u2019t even talk to you right now. Tony\u2019s in the morgue because of your stupid decisions. I never knew that you needed acceptance so bad that you would grovel to a scumbag like Jared. But you did. And you do. And look what happened. This is your fault, Jacey. Your fault.\u201d</p><p>I hang up on the middle of her sob and turn to find Maria staring at me, her dark eyes full of tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that little girl\u2019s fault,\u201d she tells me gently, her dark hair blowing in the breeze. \u201cShe makes bad decisions, but she\u2019s just young. This was Jared Markson\u2019s fault\u2014and no one else\u2019s. Tony chose to go over there. He made that decision. You can\u2019t hold Jacey accountable, Madison.\u201d</p><p>But I can. And I do.</p><p>I\u2019m so pissed off at the world that I can\u2019t see straight.</p><p>None of this is fair.</p><p>And as I slide my phone into my purse, I see something that I missed yesterday with everything going on.</p><p>A missed call from Gabriel.</p><p>It looks like he called right when I was talking to Jacey and he didn\u2019t leave a message.</p><p>It fucking figures.</p><p>And oddly enough, I can\u2019t feel anything about it. My entire body is numb. My mind, my heart, my limbs. I can\u2019t feel and that\u2019s good.</p><p>If I can\u2019t feel, then pain can\u2019t overtake me. I can step back and do what I need to do. And Gabriel doesn\u2019t matter right now.</p><p>Getting through the funeral tomorrow matters.</p><p>Getting past this god-awful grief matters.</p><p>Figuring out what to do with my life matters.</p><p>Because as I look around, at the lake, at the restaurant, at everything this place stands for, I think I\u2019m tired of it.</p><p>I\u2019m tired of it all.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>When I walk into the back door of my grandparents\u2019 cottage, I\u2019m almost bowled over as Jacey launches herself into my arms.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re home,\u201d she cries as she buries herself in my chest. I look across the kitchen to see Brand leaning in the doorway and he looks tired. He\u2019s probably been talking Jacey down all night.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys,\u201d I greet them quietly as I drop my bag on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Tony, Jacey. I know you were close to him.\u201d</p><p>She clings to me, her tear-streaked face turned up toward me. \u201cI love him, Gabe. You know that, right? You know that I would never have done this on purpose.\u201d</p><p>I have to fight the urge to lecture her, to tell her how wrong it was to first lie about Jared harassing her, then actually go back to the scumbag. She\u2019s too fragile right now, I can tell. Her slender shoulders shake as she cries and Brand shakes his head at me, cautioning me.</p><p>\u201cI know, Jace,\u201d I tell her instead. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. This is Jared\u2019s fault. There\u2019s nothing we can do now but honor Tony\u2019s memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Maddy won\u2019t even talk to me,\u201d Jacey continues to cry. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s my fault. And she\u2019s probably right. If only I hadn\u2019t gone back to Jared. If only I\u2019d listened to everyone. They\u2019re having a memorial service in the morning and I know if I go it will upset her. But I need to go, Gabe. He was my friend too. And this is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>I pat her back and soothe her and assure her in the best way I can. In my head I\u2019m pissed at her. But I can\u2019t make her feel even worse. It was a stupid thing to do, but Jacey doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body. She never meant for anyone to get hurt.</p><p>I walk her back to her room and sit her on her bed.</p><p>\u201cYou need to rest, Jacey,\u201d I instruct her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got bags under your eyes. I know you haven\u2019t slept. This wasn\u2019t your fault and you\u2019ll be going to that memorial. I\u2019ll go with you, OK?\u201d</p><p>She nods soundlessly and curls up. I pull the blanket up to her chin and close the door on my way out.</p><p>Brand is waiting for me in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be OK,\u201d he tells me as he tosses me a beer. \u201cShe was up all night. But she\u2019ll be OK. I know Maddy will come around. These things that happen so suddenly are always hard to take in.\u201d</p><p>I nod, knocking back the beer and crushing the can in my hand before I head out the back door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he calls after me.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d I answer, without stopping. He knows me well enough not to follow as I wend my way down to the beach.</p><p>When I reach the edge of the water, I drop onto my heels and stare out at the horizon. From this point, all you can see is the lake. It\u2019s vast and wide and makes me feel small.</p><p>It makes me feel like I\u2019m just a fucking speck in the universe, as though all my shit is too small to worry about. Because in the scheme of things, it is.</p><p>Life goes on. Whether it\u2019s bad or good or otherwise, it goes on. And there\u2019s not anything we can do but make the best of it.</p><p>The best thing I can do is somehow fix things with Maddy. Now\u2019s not the time, because I know she\u2019s going through hell, but I know that I have to try.</p><p>One more time.</p><p>If she hates me and doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, I\u2019ll have to deal with it.</p><p>But I\u2019ll never forgive myself if I don\u2019t even try. I\u2019m not a fucking quitter.</p><p>I can\u2019t quit at this. Not until the game is definitely over.</p><p>Not that it was ever a game at all.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Madison</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d I argue with Mila as Pax carries her down the stairs of their house and deposits her into a rented wheelchair. She glares up at me.</p><p>\u201cI love Tony just as much as you do,\u201d she answers. \u201cHow in the world could I stay here in bed during his memorial? Seriously, Maddy. He\u2019s been there for us every time we\u2019ve needed him. I\u2019m going to be there for him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunerals are for the living, Mi,\u201d I argue again. \u201cTony won\u2019t know the difference.\u201d</p><p>Pax shakes his head at me. \u201cTrust me. I argued with her all last night. Her mind\u2019s made up. She\u2019s just going to have to stay in this wheelchair and we\u2019ll bring her straight home.\u201d</p><p>I sigh in frustration. \u201cMila, the last thing I need today is to worry about you. It\u2019s going to be hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Mila glares at me again, her eyes red and her cheeks tear-streaked. \u201cMaddy, today isn\u2019t about you. I\u2019m sorry to sound rude. But today is about Tony and we should all be there. I want to be there.\u201d</p><p>Her words hit their mark, right in the middle of my heart. She\u2019s right. Today isn\u2019t about me and she has a right to be there too. I nod slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. Of course you should be there. But we\u2019ll have to bring you right back home. You can\u2019t be up very long.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI know. I promise. I\u2019ll come straight home as soon as it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Pax gets her situated in the car, then loads the wheelchair into the trunk before he turns to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it either,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut she has a point. It\u2019s important to get closure. She deserves that as much as everyone else.\u201d</p><p>I nod silently as I climb into the back seat. I\u2019m silent as we drive to the church, silent as we unload Mila, silent as we walk into the church, silent as we find our seats in the family section next to Maria and Sophia. Maria leans over to give me a hug and we settle in on the hard wooden pews.</p><p>The overwhelming scent of funeral flowers... the lilies and mums and carnations... they smell so sweet that they make my stomach turn, and they trigger memories of my parents\u2019 funeral. Of the crying, the pain, the grief. But I block them out.</p><p>Today isn\u2019t about me.</p><p>I stare straight ahead, at the glossy black urn that holds Tony. It\u2019s so small and he was so big. I can hardly believe that he fits into it.</p><p>But he does.</p><p>I can hardly believe this happened at all. But it did. Everything really can change in a moment. Everything can end and it\u2019s out of our hands. It\u2019s depressing.</p><p>I close my eyes, listening to the haunting strains of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d filtering through the speakers. I don\u2019t open my eyes again until Mila jabs me in the side.</p><p>My eyes pop open and I follow her gaze.</p><p>Gabriel is walking Jacey down the aisle, his hand on her elbow as he guides her into the church. Her face is tear-streaked and tired, but it\u2019s not her I\u2019m focused on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s him.</p><p>He\u2019s here.</p><p>My heart leaps out of its dormant sleep, out of the numb confines of my chest, and lodges in my throat as I catch and hold his gaze.</p><p>His is stormy and black, as black as night, as black as always.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t stray from mine, it holds there, like an invisible ribbon is holding us together.

It\u2019s like a thousand volts of electricity are rippling through the air, from him to me.</p><p>But then the service starts and I force my attention from him to where it belongs... to honor the man who became my surrogate father, better in so many ways than my real one.</p> <p>\u201cDearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the life of Tony Romano. A husband, a father, a friend...\u201d</p><p>My eyes well up and I press a tissue to the corners as the pastor\u2019s voice drones on. I am acutely aware of Maria sobbing silently next to me, of Pax\u2019s arm wrapped around Mila, of the flowers, of the urn, of the mourning people.</p><p>I\u2019m acutely aware of it all, but it\u2019s still as though I\u2019m suspended. Distant. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching it all through a veil.</p><p>That\u2019s what I have to do so I don\u2019t fall apart.</p><p>That\u2019s what I always do. I retreat behind a wall.</p><p>The seconds turn into minutes, then an hour. And just when I think it\u2019s over, Gabe stands up. I look at him in confusion, not sure what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>But he strides to the front with purpose, a white paper in his hand.</p><p>He murmurs a few words to the pastor, then the pastor turns to us.</p><p>\u201cLt. Gabriel Vincent would like to say a few words.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. My heart slams. What the hell?</p><p>Mila and I glance at each other briefly, but my attention is immediately and completely consumed by Gabriel. He owns thelectern, he owns the room.</p><p>He owns me.</p><p>No matter what happened or what will ever happen. He owns me. I know that now. I know it as I listen to his husky deep voice speak, as he turns to find me in the crowd, as his gaze holds mine.</p><p>Dark, stormy and black.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Tony all that well,\u201d he admits to the mourners. \u201cWe weren\u2019t close friends, because I didn\u2019t have time to really get to know him. But from what I saw, I know that given time, we\u2019d have become very close. He embodied values that I hold important. Strength, integrity, honesty. Most importantly, he was loyal. He took care of those close to him in a fierce and powerful way. He took care of my sister, Jacey, which is something I\u2019ll be forever grateful for. He took care of her when I couldn\u2019t be here to do it myself.\u201d</p><p>Gabe pauses for a deep breath and I find that I can\u2019t breathe. Somehow, in just a few sentences, Gabe is managing to drill down to the core of who Tony was in a way that the pastor hasn\u2019t been able to in an hour. I can\u2019t take my eyes off him, at the way he\u2019s standing at attention, at the way he\u2019s so sincere. This isn\u2019t a show. This isn\u2019t an act. This is a display of raw gratitude. I swallow as he continues.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take up a lot of your time today, but I just wanted to honor Tony in my own way, to thank him for protecting my sister, and for taking care of Mila and Maddy all of these years. As you can see, I\u2019m an Army Ranger. Or I was. And I can tell you that I\u2019ve seen my share of heroes over the years. And there is one thing that I can tell you... Tony Romano was a hero. I didn\u2019t know him well, but I do know that.\u201d</p><p>He steps away from the lectern and makes his way back to his seat, striding tall and confidently. I finally catch my breath and then he looks at me, taking it away again.</p><p>His words were so beautiful that I just want to cry again. I never thought he could be so eloquent. But he was. And he said the exact perfect thing.</p><p>The ushers come to let everyone out, row by row, and I\u2019m caught up in talking to Maria, to Sophia, to Mila and Pax and the people sitting behind us. When I turn around again, Gabriel, Brand and Jacey are gone.</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>\u201cThat was beautiful,\u201d Mila tells me knowingly, her green eyes staring into mine. \u201cYou need to go find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell her hesitantly. \u201cHe still left me, Mila. This doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me incredulously. \u201cMadison. He left to get help. He came back. He\u2019s here. Anyone in this room can feel how much he loves you when he looks at you. Trust me. It changes everything.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, all the emotions of the day threatening to overwhelm me.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you home,\u201d I tell her, refusing to answer that. \u201cMaria is going to spread Tony\u2019s ashes another day. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re staying for the dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave Maria,\u201d Mila tells me firmly. \u201cYou stay. I\u2019ll have Pax take me home and then he can come back and get you. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOK. If Pax doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he reassures me from behind Mila. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>He rolls my sister away and I thread through the masses of people to make my way downstairs to the dinner. A hand darts out and grabs me, though, pulling me into an alcove.</p><p>Jacey.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Madison,\u201d she tells me tearfully. \u201cPlease believe me. I hate it that you\u2019re upset with me. I hate it that you think it\u2019s my fault. I know it\u2019s my fault. I feel so guilty being here, but I couldn\u2019t stay away. I had to see Tony off.\u201d</p><p>A lump forms in my throat again and I can\u2019t help but hug her. Her eyes are just so sad.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I murmur into her hair. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not your fault. You made a stupid decision, but this was Jared\u2019s fault. I was just upset the other day. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou texted to stay put, but Jared got pissed and jumped into his truck and I didn\u2019t know what else to do except go with him\u2014to try and keep him from doing something stupid. But when he saw Tony coming around that curve, he swerved over. I don\u2019t know if he was playing chicken or what. But Tony lost control of his truck. I couldn\u2019t stop him, Maddy. I couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>Her voice breaks off and I murmur, \u201cOf course you couldn\u2019t, Jacey. No one can control him.\u201d</p><p>She cries and I hold her and we stand together for what seems like forever, until a deep voice clears. I look over Jacey\u2019s shoulder to find Gabriel leaning against the wall, watching us, his gaze immediately impaling me straight through the heart.</p><p>I let go of Jacey and stand limp, and suddenly it\u2019s just Gabe and me.</p><p>The room spins around and we\u2019re alone in it, alone in the world. As if she\u2019s speaking from a fog, I hear Jacey tell me that she\u2019ll leave us alone to talk but I can\u2019t even acknowledge it. All I can do is stare at Gabriel.</p><p>He takes a step toward me, then another one, then he\u2019s close enough that I can smell his smell, the smell that is so distinctly him.</p><p>\u201cYou left me,\u201d I whisper, staring directly into his eyes. \u201cI hated you for that.\u201d</p><p>His face is pained and he nods. \u201cI know. I hated me for that too. I\u2019m sorry, Madison. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t see any other way. But I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>I nod, stiltedly. Because I don\u2019t know what to do. Because he was wrong. Because the world is whirling around and around and all I want to do is launch myself into his arms, but I can\u2019t. I shouldn\u2019t. Everything is all muddled up in my head and I can\u2019t remember how I should feel.</p><p>All I know is how I do feel.</p><p>I\u2019ve missed him so much. All I want is him.</p><p>I\u2019m frozen and Gabe can see that.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we get you back to the dinner. And then maybe afterward... would you talk to me for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>His handsome face is hopeful and vulnerable even while it is strong. And there\u2019s nothing I can do but nod.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Because I have to.</p><p>Because I need you to say all the right things.</p><p>Please.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>The dinner passes excruciatingly slowly, but finally it is over. Maddy has hugged and kissed everyone she needs to hug and kiss. She\u2019s made small talk. She\u2019s comforted people. She\u2019s been comforted.</p><p>Through it all she\u2019s been very aware of where I am. She\u2019s watched me out of the corner of her eye, like she\u2019s afraid that I\u2019m going to leave again.</p><p>Before I can give her an explanation for last time.</p><p>No fucking way. There\u2019s no way I would.</p><p>I watch as Maddy gives Jacey a hug, then hands her off to Brand. \u201cCan you give her a ride home?\u201d I ask him quietly. \u201cI need to stay and talk to Madison.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cDefinitely. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need it,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>But when Maddy looks at me, it\u2019s soft. It\u2019s hopeful. It\u2019s not filled with hate or anger or fear. It\u2019s filled with hope.</p><p>And that fills me with hope.</p><p>I walk to her side, back to where I belong. She looks up at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a car,\u201d she tells me. \u201cPax brought me. Would you mind giving me a ride home? We can talk there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I agree quickly.</p><p>I guide her through the people who are left at the dinner, out to my car, where I open her door.</p><p>As I get in my side, she looks at me. \u201cYou look really good in your uniform,\u201d she tells me. \u201cAnd what you said about Tony today... well, it was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant every word,\u201d I tell her honestly.</p><p>Because I do.</p><p>As I drive she calls Pax and tells him that she doesn\u2019t need a ride. I notice that she doesn\u2019t tell him why... she doesn\u2019t tell him who is taking her home instead. But that doesn\u2019t matter right now.</p><p>All that matters is that she\u2019s giving me a chance. One chance.</p><p>And I\u2019m sure as hell not going to blow it.</p><p>When we get to her house, she leads me out to the patio, where we sit at the table.</p><p>\u201cWould you like wine or a beer?\u201d she asks hesitantly, her blue eyes glued to mine. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cNo. All I need is you, Maddy.\u201d</p><p>She sucks in her breath and even though I didn\u2019t mean to say it, I didn\u2019t mean to start with that, it makes sense now. Because it\u2019s the absolute fucking truth.</p><p>As I look at her, backlit by the sun and gorgeous as fucking hell, it\u2019s the only thing I can think of. All I need is her.</p><p>Everything starts spilling out, one word after another.</p><p>How I felt the night I left. How fucking hard it was. What I tried to do with Alex, but couldn\u2019t. How I couldn\u2019t erase Maddy from my mind no matter what I did. How I balanced on the ledge at the hotel and how Brand talked me down. The absolute utter fucking bleakness. The treatment. The therapy. How the little girl doesn\u2019t haunt me as much. How I turned Annie away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI missed you every single fucking minute,\u201d I tell her earnestly, honestly. Desperately. \u201cI can\u2019t live without you. Nothing I did could get you out of my head. I was miserable every minute that I was gone.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her and she stares back and I can\u2019t read her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m not whole when I\u2019m not with you,\u201d I tell her simply. \u201cYou\u2019re a piece of me. A big piece of me. And when you\u2019re gone, I can\u2019t function right. I\u2019m only half a person. I\u2019m so sorry. I know I fucked up. I acted with dishonor. I left you. But I did what I had to do to try and keep you safe. Do you understand? Do you see?\u201d</p><p>She looks sick as she looks away.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you almost slept with someone else,\u201d she says limply. \u201cI was dying here, Gabe. All I could think of was you. I would never have slept with anyone else. I just wouldn\u2019t have. I missed you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cGod, I missed you. Every minute. I did a stupid thing, Maddy. I tried to do the only thing I could think of to finally get you out of my head. And it didn\u2019t work. Nothing worked. But if you give me another chance, I swear to God that I won\u2019t hurt you again. I\u2019ll never leave you. I\u2019ll never even look at someone else. You\u2019re all I want.\u201d</p><p>Without a word she gets up and walks down to the beach. She is completely silent as she stares out at the water, completely beautiful.</p><p>\u201cMaddy?\u201d I finally say after the minutes have ticked past. She turns to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she admits. \u201cI know I should tell you to leave. To never come back. But honestly, I don\u2019t have it in me. I\u2019m pissed, though. I\u2019m pissed because whoever that woman was, she touched what was mine. You were almost inside of her, Gabe. And you\u2019re mine. What am I supposed to do with that?\u201d</p> <p>I take a ragged breath. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to put it out of your mind, Maddy. Never think about it again. Because I didn\u2019t want her. I only wanted you. In my head, it was your face I saw. Your eyes. Your smell. Your hands touching me. Please forgive me, Madison. I don\u2019t deserve you. That much is true. But all I want is you. And if I can\u2019t have you, then I don\u2019t want anyone.\u201d</p><p>A tear slips down her cheek and she squeezes her eyes shut. I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to grab her, to pull her to me, to never let her out of my sight again, but I don\u2019t know what she wants me to do.</p><p>After a minute she opens her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d Her voice is small.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your arms.\u201d</p> <p>So I do.</p><p>I open them wide and she folds into them, burying her face into my chest, and I do what I\u2019ve wanted to do for two weeks. I hold her tight. I breathe in the smell of her hair, I run my hands over the slender expanse of her back.</p><p>I tilt her chin up and kiss her mouth, crushing her soft lips with my own.</p><p>After a breathless minute she pulls away and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me again.\u201d</p><p>I nod, scooping her up into my arms, and carry her into the house.</p><p>Madison</p><p>This is real.</p> <p>That\u2019s the only thing I can think of as Gabriel carries me into the house and into the bedroom. This is real and Gabriel is here.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what I should be feeling right now, whether I\u2019m letting him off too easily or whether I should try to be standoffish. All I know is I can\u2019t.</p><p>Because whatever happened tortured him.</p><p>I can see that on his face and it breaks my heart.</p><p>And I know that I need him.</p><p>I look at him, and for some reason, all the leftover feelings... the being mad at him, the hurt, the fear... it all fades away. I know what\u2019s important now.</p><p>Him and me. That\u2019s it.</p><p>That\u2019s all that matters. We can sort everything else out.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped trusting you,\u201d I tell him honestly. \u201cNot really. When I first realized you were gone, I was pissed. And hurt. But I figured out why you left pretty quickly. And then I was pissed again. But I always trusted that you thought you were doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me, his rugged face pensive. \u201cAll I want is you,\u201d he tells me quietly. \u201cI promise you. I\u2019m so sorry I hurt you. I\u2019m sorry that our path has been twisted and hard. But I want you to know... thinking about you gave me the strength to stick it out at CPT. In the back of my head, I always held out the hope that if I could fix me, then we could fix us.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cThat was in the back of my mind too. Even when I was pissed at you. Even when I hated you.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, his eyes so stormy. \u201cDon\u2019t hate me, Maddy. I can deal with anything else the world throws at me, but I can\u2019t deal with that. I love you. I\u2019ve known it for a while and I was afraid to say it. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m fixed, but I\u2019m sure as hell headed in the right direction. I won\u2019t ever hurt you again\u2014I won\u2019t let it happen. I need for you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper, pulling him close and clinging to him tight. \u201cI need you, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>He swallows. \u201cI need you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen show me,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Without a word he eases me backward onto the bed, covering my body with his own. I\u2019ve missed his weight, the way his body slides against mine just right, pressing into me.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he says, right before he kisses me. His tongue delves into my mouth and he tastes like spearmint.</p><p>He kisses me soft, he kisses me hard, then he groans and fucks my mouth with his tongue, ravaging it like he can\u2019t control himself because he\u2019s missed me that much.</p><p>The air around us is desperate and hot and I want to breathe him in.</p><p>His hands are everywhere, sliding down my hips, pulling at my clothes. I help kick them away and within a minute we are both naked. The friction is delicious and I revel in the feel of his body against mine.</p><p>My hips tilt for him and he cups me there, his mouth tracing my arm.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you smell,\u201d he tells me as he runs his lips along my shoulder, kissing my skin lightly as he makes his way back to my mouth. \u201cI dream about that smell.\u201d</p><p>I dream about him.</p><p>About this.</p><p>I lift my legs around his hips and pull him toward me... into me.</p><p>And suddenly I feel complete. He takes all of me, right down to my fingertips, to my toes, to the innermost parts of my heart.</p><p>My hidden parts.</p><p>My secrets.</p><p>He takes it and takes it and I give it all.</p><p>Because I want him to have it.</p><p>As he slides into me I know that I never want to be without him again. It\u2019s a heady feeling and it doesn\u2019t terrify me a bit.</p><p>As he slowly thrusts into me, in and out, leisurely, slowly, he skims his hands everywhere... as though he can\u2019t stop touching me.</p><p>Like he\u2019s trying to decide if I\u2019m real.</p><p>I look into his dark eyes. \u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>He grins, a slow smile that spreads to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he answers, before he buries his face in my neck and shudders from his release. \u201cI love you too. God, I love you.\u201d</p><p>His words, ragged and raw, pierce my heart and send me over the edge and I follow him, shaking and arching against him, crying his name as I come.</p><p>As I lie beneath him, I know that I could die a happy death here in his arms, and we lie twisted together for what seems like forever, just listening to each other breathe.</p><p>But eventually we get hungry, so I make a tray of sliced meat, cheese and crackers and we curl up on the sofa with a bottle of wine.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your nightmares?\u201d I ask as I sip at my wine. \u201cAre they gone?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve had them, but only for part of the night. It used to be a continuous thing, all night long. We can keep our fingers crossed that it lasts. Either way it\u2019s progress. For now, though, I\u2019m going to sleep on your chaise. I don\u2019t want to take any chances just yet.\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to sleep apart, but I also don\u2019t want to get strangled again. So we\u2019ll do what we have to do.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice the house?\u201d I ask him quietly and he looks around, only just now noticing the new paint and furniture. \u201cI know you carried me into my old bedroom and I didn\u2019t correct you, but I\u2019ve moved into the master bedroom. I\u2019ve had everything changed... to make it my own.\u201d</p><p>Gabe stares at me, with something very close to admiration in his eyes. \u201cSo you\u2019ve gone from not being able to open that door to moving in there in two weeks\u2019 time?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got balls, Gabe. Someone told me that once.\u201d</p><p>He smiles back. \u201cYou do have balls. Whoever told you that was brilliant.\u201d</p><p>We laugh and drop our plates in the sink, then head back to bed, where I curl up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me again,\u201d I tell him before I close my eyes to sleep. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he answers quietly, dropping a kiss on the top of my head. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home.\u201d</p><p>I look up at him, struggling to keep my eyes open after this hellishly long day. \u201cDo you really consider Angel Bay home now?\u201d</p><p>He brushes the hair away from my face with his strong fingers as he stares down at me.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I consider wherever you are home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way in a couple of minutes,\u201d I tell Mila, balancing the phone between my chin and my shoulder as I grab my purse from the kitchen table. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop and get you a milkshake and then we\u2019ll be there. Please don\u2019t make it weird, OK? I\u2019m really not comfortable bringing him out there so soon, but Pax needs me to sit with you, so...\u201d My voice trails off because I\u2019m not sure what to say.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be OK,\u201d Mila tells me cheerfully, before she lowers her voice. \u201cTrust me, I understand. But just know that Pax plans on talking to Gabe.\u201d</p><p>I freeze. \u201cTalking to him?\u201d</p><p>I can practically see Mila nod. \u201cYeah. I told him touching isn\u2019t allowed when he talks to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks for that,\u201d I answer. \u201cTell him he really doesn\u2019t need to. Gabe and I have worked it out. I know why he left. He had a good reason. He\u2019s only been back for a day. I don\u2019t need for Pax to scare him off already.\u201d</p><p>I know Gabriel isn\u2019t going anywhere. But still.</p><p>\u201cI know that he left for a good reason,\u201d Mila sighs. \u201cAnd you know that. But Pax just wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s a man thing, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I sigh as I hang up. Gabe looks at me from the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks as he turns the key and his Camaro fires up. I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cApparently, Pax wants to talk to you about what happened. I\u2019m sorry. I could tell him not to, but it\u2019s probably best just to get it out of the way. He doesn\u2019t have much family and so he\u2019s protective over who he\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nods, unaffected. \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he tells me easily. \u201cI respect that. And I deserve it. I\u2019ll listen to whatever he has to say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head. \u201cMen.\u201d</p><p>We grab the milkshake and are at Pax and Mila\u2019s within a few minutes.</p><p>As we walk up to the front door, Pax opens it. Apparently he\u2019s been watching for us.</p><p>\u201cHey, little brother,\u201d I greet him carefully. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>Pax is wearing his most intimidating expression as he opens the door wider, motioning for us to come in. If I were a guy, I\u2019d be tucking my tail and running. But Gabe doesn\u2019t. He stands firmly at my side.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mad,\u201d Pax greets me before turning to Gabe. \u201cCan you give us a minute? I\u2019d like to talk to Gabe, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I do,\u201d I tell Pax. \u201cI\u2019ll just stick around for this. And don\u2019t forget what Mila told you. No touching allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that,\u201d Pax tells me as we head up into the living room. I glance at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I do. I\u2019ll stay,\u201d I answer firmly.</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cSuit yourself. It\u2019s not going to take long,\u201d he says, turning to Gabe.</p><p>\u201cI already told you that I respect the hell out of what you did as a Ranger. Because of all the shit you had to do, it doesn\u2019t surprise me that you came home with baggage. That\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t hold that against you.</p><p>\u201cBut if you ever treat Maddy like that again\u2014if you ever leave her high and dry or lay one finger on her in a way that I don\u2019t approve of, I will fuck you up. You might be an Army Ranger, but don\u2019t ever doubt that I can hold my own.\u201d</p><p>Gabe looks at him in the eye as they stand toe-to-toe. Pax\u2019s arm flexes at his side, but Gabe remains relaxed and still.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that,\u201d Gabe answers calmly. \u201cAny of it. Trust me, I\u2019m not going to hurt Maddy again. I promised her and I promise you. What I did was shitty. I didn\u2019t know how else to protect her from me, so I just left. If I could do it over, I would think of another way. But I can\u2019t. What I can do is promise to never fuck up like that again.\u201d</p><p>Pax nods slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s all that needs to be said. I respect the hell out of you coming to Tony\u2019s funeral and speaking. That was a stand-up thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe nods slowly. \u201cThanks. It just seemed like the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>There is a pause and I stare at Pax.</p><p>\u201cAre you done waving your penis around now? Because I should go see Mila and I don\u2019t want to leave you two alone unless it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s safe, Mad. She\u2019s upstairs, of course. I need to talk to Gabe a little about business before I leave. Thank you again for coming out today. I know that she doesn\u2019t need a babysitter, but I just don\u2019t like her being alone now that her due date is so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be alone. It\u2019s not a big deal for me to be here.\u201d</p><p>When I walk away, I overhear Pax talking to Gabe about his armor again, something that makes me smile. I knew that he\u2019d only withdrawn from investing because of me.</p><p>He\u2019s loyal to the bone.</p><p>I climb the stairs and poke my head in Mila\u2019s room.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over. Everyone has been adequately threatened and apparently all is well.\u201d</p><p>I hand her the milkshake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201c Mila answers. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to say anything at all, but you know how men are.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she rolls this way and that, trying to get situated. I bend and adjust the giant pillow that she keeps behind her back.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She nods, but I can tell she\u2019s lying. \u201cI can\u2019t get comfortable today,\u201d she grumbles. \u201cMy back hurts. And my hips. And my everything. It\u2019s probably because I\u2019m getting so enormous. And because I\u2019m stuck in this freaking bed.\u201d</p><p>I eye her tiny body. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re enormous. You look like a gnat with gas. Sit still and I\u2019ll do your nails. It\u2019ll keep your mind off of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try,\u201d Mila sighs as she examines her hand. \u201cBut my discomfort refuses to be ignored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>I have painted her fingers and have moved on to her toes before she finally brings up Gabe. I\u2019ve been waiting for it. Actually, I\u2019m surprised it took her this long.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you going to tell me more about how it\u2019s going with Gabe?\u201d she asks, attempting to be casual.</p><p>I smile. \u201cIt\u2019s great, actually. I know he\u2019s only been home a day, but apparently his nightmares have gotten better and things are on the right track. We\u2019re good, Mila. It\u2019s hard because so much has happened, but I\u2019m just so happy he\u2019s back. That\u2019s all that matters right now. We\u2019ll deal with everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that feeling.\u201d Mila nods. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through all of this, Mad. But trust me, sometimes the hardest situations make for the best happily-ever-afters. I have to believe that you\u2019re gonna get yours. Gabriel has definitely put the work in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I agree. \u201cI keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. To find out that it\u2019s not real. That I just dreamed it\u2014that I\u2019m going to wake up and he\u2019s still going to be gone. But so far, so good. It\u2019s real and he\u2019s here and everything\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d she tells me knowingly, glancing at my face.</p><p>I look up at her. \u201cUsed to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed to loving someone like that, used to not waiting for it all to collapse. I know it\u2019s hard, especially after he left you like that. I know how that feels. Gabe loves you too, you know. Anyone can see it. And one of these days, you\u2019re going to realize that what you have is real. You\u2019ll learn to trust it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope so,\u201d I murmur, knowing exactly what she means. We slip into silence as I finish up her toes, each of us lost in her thoughts.</p><p>After a while, after the nail polish has dried, Mila shakes her head, as if to shake the thoughts away.</p><p>\u201cI could really use a shower,\u201d she tells me wryly. \u201cI only get to have one once a week, you know. It\u2019s the grossest thing ever. Those sponge baths just don\u2019t do it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do smell,\u201d I agree and she slugs me. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll help. Let me go get your stuff ready and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She nods and I make my way into her bathroom to get her shower bench ready, and line up all her bath products so she doesn\u2019t have to reach for them.</p><p>I come back and take her spindly little arm, helping her from her bed. Her muscles shake as we walk, evidence of how much they\u2019ve deteriorated over the past few months of disuse. The doctor said it was normal, that she\u2019d build them back up after the baby was born, but right now she\u2019s so clearly weak.</p><p>\u201cYou really do have chicken legs now,\u201d I tell her helpfully as she takes off her robe and I settle her on the bench. \u201cJust like Tony always said.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of Tony makes my throat instantly tight, makes me instantly sad, and I wish I hadn\u2019t said it. I guess Mila thinks the same way because she punches me again.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d I grumble as I turn on the water nozzle and accidentally spray her in the face with it. She screeches at the cold water, grasping at me with wet hands.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I shriek, grabbing her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Calm down before you hurt yourself. You were up entirely too much yesterday. You don\u2019t need to push your luck today.\u201d</p><p>She obediently settles down and sits still as I spray her hair with warm water and work it into a lather with shampoo. I hum aimlessly as my fingers massage her scalp, then as I rinse the soap out.</p><p>I absently space out, lost in my thoughts; thinking about Gabe, and about what he might do. Will he maybe move in with me? It\u2019s all so exciting and new and terrifying.</p><p>Suddenly Mila startles, grasping at her stomach, pulling me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask anxiously. \u201cAre you in labor?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, flinches as she curls over into herself.</p><p>\u201cOw. No, I don\u2019t think so. This isn\u2019t right,\u201d she mutters. \u201cLabor is supposed to be a gradual thing. This... owwww.\u201d She moans, clutching at her stomach again. She glances up at me, her face suddenly pale. \u201cMaddy, this isn\u2019t right. Something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Shit. It\u2019s because she was up yesterday.</p><p>\u201cPax,\u201d I shout in panic, but I quickly realize that he won\u2019t be able to hear us from in here.</p><p>My hands are shaking so much that I can barely get her out of the shower. Somehow I manage, but just as I reach to turn the water off, she screams, loud and shrill, before she completely doubles over.</p><p>Looking down, I see that the sudsy water swirling around the drain has turned red with blood.</p><p>Within seconds it turns into more blood than I have ever seen.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>Pax is just telling me how interested his grandfather is in DefenseTech\u2019s armor when we hear a bloodcurdling scream. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s Maddy or Mila, but it doesn\u2019t matter.</p><p>We both lunge to our feet and race down the hall.</p><p>As we burst into the bedroom, Maddy is pulling Mila out of the bathroom. Mila is completely naked, dripping wet and covered in blood.</p><p>\u201cPax,\u201d Maddy shrieks. \u201cWe need an ambulance.\u201d</p><p>I immediately pull out my phone and dial 911 but Pax shakes his head as he scoops up his unconscious wife.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d he shouts over his shoulder as he runs down the stairs with his bloody wife in his arms.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Mila rips a sheet from the bed and we follow Pax as fast we can. Mila is bleeding so much that there is a wide trail of blood on the stairs. Maddy slips in it, tumbling to the landing, smearing blood onto her clothing, her hands and her face.</p><p>I pull her up and we race to meet Pax at the car.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Maddy tells Pax, thrusting the sheet at him. \u201cAt least cover her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry up,\u201d he grunts, holding Mila out so that Maddy can ram the sheet down around her. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta hurry. What happened, Maddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Maddy admits, her voice shaking. \u201cI was giving her a shower and then she screamed. There\u2019s way too much blood.\u201d</p><p>And there is. It\u2019s gushing everywhere, dripping through the sheet and onto Pax, saturating his clothes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive,\u201d I offer, leaping into the driver\u2019s side door. Maddy dives into the back and Pax collapses into the passenger seat with Mila on his lap. It\u2019s tight, but in his desperation he makes it work.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d he commands me, although there\u2019s no need. My foot is already on the floor.</p><p>The wheels on the Charger barely touch the ground as we fly toward the hospital. As I drive, Maddy calls up to Pax, \u201cDo you know her doctor\u2019s number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Pax snaps back. \u201cI don\u2019t know that shit. Just call 911. They can let the hospital know that we\u2019re on the way.\u201d</p><p>So Maddy does, her voice shrill as she tells the dispatcher the situation.</p><p>Mila doesn\u2019t open her eyes for the entire ten-minute drive to the hospital, regardless of Pax\u2019s pleading. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMila, just look at me,\u201d he begs, pushing her hair out of her face.

Jesus Christ.\u201d</p> <p>Maddy scrambles to try to help from behind us, to try to see, just as I pull into the parking lot. Before I\u2019ve even come to a stop at the curb, Pax has the door open and is laying Mila out on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby,\u201d he begs as he kneels and gives her a breath. \u201cBreathe.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s frantic and desperate and covered in Mila\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cPax,\u201d Maddy cries, pulling at his arm. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her inside. We don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>She pulls at him, but Pax isn\u2019t thinking clearly and he shakes her off, turning back to Mila, trying to breathe into her mouth.</p> <p>He\u2019s interrupted by a team of people bursting through the doors with a gurney. Pax lunges up with Mila in his arms and thrusts her at the medical team.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not breathing,\u201d he tells them in desperation. \u201cPlease\u2014help her.\u201d</p><p>The doctors and nurses close in around Mila as they lay her out on the gurney and rush her inside.</p><p>As they do, Maddy clings helplessly to the side of the gurney. Looking down, I see that Mila\u2019s eyes are still closed and she is as pale as I\u2019ve ever seen anyone. More terrifying than that, though, are the words coming out of the nurses\u2019 mouths.</p><p>She\u2019s unresponsive.</p><p>There\u2019s no pulse.</p> <p>We need the paddles.</p><p>Maddy flinches as she hears them, tears running down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Maddy tells her sister as the team shoves the gurney through the double doors and out of our sight. \u201cMila, you\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMila, I\u2019m here!\u201d Pax calls after her, when a nurse blocks his way. But Mila stays motionless. She couldn\u2019t hear any of it.</p><p>Fuckkkkkk.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so helpless as when I watch them take her away. I know there\u2019s nothing I can do and from the looks of all that blood staining the sheets covering her, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything anyone can do. There\u2019s no way she\u2019s not going to die.</p><p>There\u2019s so much blood.</p><p>Hell. All of a sudden the blood reminds me too much of that night in Afghanistan and my senses threaten to overtake me: the smell of blood, the taste of fear, the feel of panic.</p> <p>The smoke.</p><p>The death.</p><p>The bloody children.</p><p>I fight it off, trying to breathe.</p><p>Maddy needs me. I can\u2019t lose my shit.</p><p>I take a deep breath, sucking in the fear and releasing it on the exhale.</p><p>I suck in the panic, releasing it on the exhale.</p><p>It\u2019s a trick Dr. Hart taught me and it seems to work.</p><p>By the time Maddy collapses into my arms a minute later, turning her face into my chest, I\u2019ve calmed down. I can breathe again.</p><p>I\u2019m fine, even if Mila is not.</p><p>What the fuck? Where\u2019s the justice in that?</p><p>Maddy hides her face as if she\u2019s hiding from what is happening, hiding from the world, hiding from death. I choke as I realize something.</p><p>Loss is her greatest fear. She just lost Tony and now she might lose Mila too.</p><p>Her bad thing has caught her.</p><p>I close my arms around her. It\u2019s the only thing I can do.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d Maddy says for the hundredth time as we all pace in the hospital waiting room. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine. I can\u2019t lose her too. I just can\u2019t. She\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t even think she knows she\u2019s speaking. The words just automatically come out of her mouth at timed intervals, wooden and lifeless. I agree with her. I tell her that Mila will be fine, even though I don\u2019t believe it myself. Maddy doesn\u2019t even notice.</p><p>Pax is in his own world. They wouldn\u2019t let him back with Mila and he\u2019s like a caged lion out here. His muscles coil as he walks in tight circles. The tension in this room is palpable. I can taste the fear in the air, but no one acknowledges it.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doctors,\u201d Maddy tells Pax. \u201cThey can fix her.\u201d</p><p>Pax looks up, his eyes completely stark, but doesn\u2019t answer as he paces past Maddy.</p><p>In turn, Maddy paces past me.</p><p>It\u2019s a continuous, nerve-racking cycle.</p><p>We\u2019re left out here alone, wondering what the fuck is going on. The worst thing is the not knowing. But knowing will be even worse. I feel so certain about that. Because there\u2019s no way Mila can survive.</p><p>There\u2019s no way.</p><p>And as I look at Pax and see how his face is drawn, how he\u2019s so pale, how he\u2019s pacing and flexing his hands and trying to breathe, I know he knows it too.</p><p>His bad thing has caught him too.</p><p>The very worst possible thing.</p><p>Seconds tick by. Then minutes. Then an hour. Then two. A nurse comes out a time or two to tell us that the doctors are still working, that they\u2019ll come back out when there\u2019s more news.</p><p>More time passes.</p><p>I get Pax and Madison coffee. I get them water. I go to the restroom and bring them back wet paper towels to wipe the blood from their faces. Neither of them even notices.</p><p>They are immersed in fear.</p><p>\u201cShe was so cold,\u201d Madison tells me, her voice almost emotionless. \u201cShe was so cold, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>I rub her back, I pull her close. I watch the clock.</p><p>Another half hour passes.</p><p>There\u2019s no way she survived. There\u2019s no way.</p><p>Finally a doctor emerges from the double doors. He looks exhausted.</p><p>But more than that, he looks gutted.</p><p>Shit. I suck in my breath.</p><p>Pax leaps to his feet and Maddy freezes, both waiting for the worst, praying for the best, afraid to know which it is.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d the doctor assures us, after what seems like forever. \u201cHer placenta detached, causing her to hemorrhage. And when you handed her to us outside, she didn\u2019t have a pulse. She had lost that much blood. Her body shut down\u2014in total shock. We managed to revive her, thankfully. It took us a while, but we were able to stop the blood flow and repair the damage.\u201d He pauses, letting that sink in.</p><p>Both Pax and Maddy look stricken.</p><p>\u201cShe really died?\u201d Pax asks in shock.</p><p>The doctor nods. \u201cShe had no heartbeat when she arrived. But we were able to bring her back within two minutes. She\u2019s going to be fine. And she\u2019s asking to see you,\u201d he tells Pax. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep it short. She\u2019s exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Pax immediately starts toward the door, but pauses. \u201cThe baby?\u201d he asks anxiously, his eyes glistening wet.</p><p>The doctor smiles. \u201cA healthy baby girl. Since she\u2019s a couple of weeks early, she\u2019ll stay here for a few days. But everything looks good, son. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>His words lift the cloud of fear from the room, it evaporates, and Pax smiles as he heads out the doors.</p><p>Maddy falls into me, slumping into my side with a sob.</p><p>I hold her up, then stare into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI told you she would be fine,\u201d I remind her. \u201cSee? I keep my promises.\u201d</p><p>She finally allows herself to smile.</p><p>\u201cYou do, don\u2019t you?\u201d she murmurs. \u201cI was so scared, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell her softly. I hold her clutched to me for several minutes, waiting while she pulls herself back together. Finally she shoves her hair out of her face and gets up and paces.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see my niece,\u201d she finally tells me. \u201cI wonder who she looks like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s got good genes,\u201d I point out. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be a looker.\u201d</p><p>Maddy collapses again, onto my lap.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how scared I was,\u201d she admits quietly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if I\u2019d have lost Mila.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cI know. But you held it together so well, Maddy. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles a little. \u201cI kept reminding myself that fear is a choice, but it wasn\u2019t working out so well for me. I was too afraid.\u201d</p><p>I smile back. \u201cI think in this situation, that\u2019s allowed,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt was scary. But it\u2019s going to be OK. She\u2019s fine. The baby\u2019s fine. Everything is fine.\u201d</p><p>Maddy relaxes against me, nervously speculating about what the baby looks like and what they\u2019re going to name her.</p><p>\u201cYou just can\u2019t wait to buy her little shoes,\u201d I joke, trying to lift some of the lingering anxiety. Maddy smiles.</p><p>\u201cOh, I definitely can\u2019t wait to do that. This is going to be the best-dressed baby in the state.\u201d</p><p>We anxiously wait until Pax comes to get us and then Maddy beats us both back to Mila\u2019s room. When we arrive, Maddy is sitting next to Mila, holding her hand, telling her how scared we all were.</p><p>I glance around, but there\u2019s no baby.</p><p>I look at Madison questioningly.</p><p>\u201cSince she was early, they had to take her to the neonatal unit,\u201d she explains. \u201cPax can show her to us through the window in a little bit.\u201d</p><p>Mila is pale and obviously tired, but other than that she looks good.</p><p>\u201cYou can go see her now,\u201d she tells us tiredly. \u201cI know you want to see her, Mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Pax asks. \u201cWe can wait.\u201d</p><p>Mila nods. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Go see our daughter.\u201d</p><p>We find the neonatal unit and we all press our noses to the window. When the nurse pushes the incubator up closer to the window, Maddy coos at the tiny baby through the glass.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she announces, although I personally think she\u2019s red and wrinkly. \u201cWhat are you naming her?\u201d</p><p>Pax glances at Maddy.</p><p>\u201cMadelyn Susanna Tate,\u201d he announces proudly. \u201cAfter you and my mom.\u201d</p><p>Maddy goes completely still, her mouth dropping open in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re naming her after me?\u201d she whispers. Pax grins.</p><p>\u201cWho else would we name her after? There aren\u2019t that many derivatives of Pax.\u201d</p><p>Maddy grins widely and then turns to the baby again, talking to her through the glass.</p><p>\u201cListen up, Mad. You and I are going to stick together. I\u2019m going to buy you so many pairs of shoes that your daddy will have to build a new house just to store them in. Yes, I know... that\u2019s a lot. But you\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at Pax.</p><p>\u201cI feel for you, dude,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShe\u2019s probably not exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know she\u2019s not,\u201d Pax sighs. \u201cBut that\u2019s OK. My girls have me wrapped around their little fingers already. I\u2019m man enough to admit it.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but grin at this. But I\u2019ll never fault him for it. I have a weakness too. I glance at Maddy again and decide that if I\u2019m going to have a weakness, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s a beautiful one.</p><p>\u201cMadison, we should tell your sister goodbye so that she can rest,\u201d I suggest to her gently. \u201cWe can come back tomorrow. And we can even bring shoes for Madelyn, if you want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I want,\u201d she says firmly. She blows a kiss to the baby and we make our way back to Mila\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back tomorrow, Sis.\u201d Maddy kisses Mila on the cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t ever scare me like that again,\u201d she adds sternly. Mila smiles the gentle tired smile of a new mom, promising that she won\u2019t. Not ever.</p><p>And with that, we duck from the room.</p><p>As we drive home, I pick up Madison\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I ask her solemnly. \u201cThat was intense.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me.</p><p>\u201cThat was intense,\u201d she agrees. \u201dI thought I was going to have a heart attack. First there was all that blood, and then Mila passed out. I didn\u2019t know what to do. She died, Gabe. I still can\u2019t believe it. But having you there in that waiting room with me... you make everything all right, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>I feel choked up by her words, by the strength with which she handles everything in life. By the trust she puts in me.</p><p>As I put the car in park in the driveway, I kiss her forehead.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d I tell her quietly. \u201cReally. You think I\u2019m the strongest person you know, but really, it\u2019s you. You\u2019re stronger than all of us.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes, but falls silent as we go inside.</p><p>We eat dinner in thoughtful silence, then sit for a little while in the living room, still quiet as Maddy lies on my lap. \u201cWe should go over to Pax and Mila\u2019s house and clean up all that blood,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI know Pax will be staying with Mila tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWe will. But we\u2019ll do it tomorrow. You\u2019re tired tonight.\u201d</p><p>She nods and she\u2019s shivering from cold and from the shock of what happened, so I suggest a hot shower. She stays in there for half an hour.</p> <p>When she finally comes out, I hold out a towel for her and envelop her in it, pulling her into my arms as I dry her off.</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t say anything and is even quieter after we collapse into bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I finally ask her, because the silence is killing me.</p><p>She sighs in the dark.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I know how fast everything can end. My parents were gone in an instant and tonight it seemed like Mila could slip away too. And in that one instant, my heart would be broken forever, I know that\u2014because I\u2019ve been through it before. Hearts are so fragile, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>She pauses as she stares at me. I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019s wanting me to say. But she doesn\u2019t give me a chance to reply at all before she continues.</p><p>\u201cIt reminded me of how fast I could lose you. Anything can happen and it scares the shit out of me. It scares me that you have that power over me.\u201d</p><p>She stops talking and stares at me. Her hands are shaking and I pick one up.</p> <p>\u201cMaddy, you have that same power over me. It\u2019s called loving someone. And yeah, it\u2019s scary as hell. I hate knowing that loving you makes me weak... but it makes me strong too. Loving you makes me happy in a way that nothing else ever has, and that\u2019s healthy, Madison. That\u2019s healthier than anything else in the world. It heals a lot of shit. It\u2019s even healing me and I\u2019m fucked up. So before you over-think it and decide that loving me isn\u2019t worth the fear of losing me, just remember how happy you are when we\u2019re together. Fear is a choice, Maddy. But so is being happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she admits quietly. \u201cMy head knows that. But my heart is scared because it knows that in a moment you could be gone. Everyone always seems to leave me, Gabe. My parents, Tony. Mila almost did. And if you leave... if you leave nothing will ever be OK again.\u201d</p><p>Her voice breaks and she cries, softly in the night, and it clenches my stomach into knots.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I know why you\u2019re scared. Anyone would be in your shoes. You\u2019ve seen too much loss. But death is part of life and the fear of it can\u2019t stop us from living. That\u2019s something I learned in Afghanistan. Being ruled by fear is worse than never living at all. We\u2019re going to be fine, Maddy. You\u2019re not going to lose me, not until we\u2019re old and gray and tired. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She is quiet and still as she huddles against me, her slender hands holding tight to mine.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s make this work, no matter what. Promise me, Gabe. I know there\u2019s shit to work through. But we can do it. Because all that really matters is you and me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is thin and anxious and I run my hands along her face, dropping them to stroke her shoulder. She trembles beneath my fingers and I hug her close. I know how much it took for her to say that, for her to commit to trying something long-term with me. It just confirms everything I\u2019ve always known about her.</p><p>The girl has balls.</p><p>\u201cMadison, everything is going to be fine,\u201d I tell her firmly. \u201cNow that I\u2019m back, you\u2019re stuck with me. I\u2019m never going to leave you. Please don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of anymore.\u201d</p><p>I can feel her smile against my chest. And then she burrows even more tightly into me. I rest my hands on her side and stare down at her in the dark.</p><p>She sniffs. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019m afraid of is losing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d I answer her firmly, ignoring the ache in my chest at her words. \u201cThat\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d</p><p>I hold her until she goes to sleep, then I continue to hold her as long as I dare stay in the bed. When I finally know that I can\u2019t hold my eyes open anymore, I carefully slip away to the chair.</p><p>The chair is cold and it seems like a thousand miles away from Maddy, but I\u2019m still here with her. That\u2019s the important thing.</p><p>I close my eyes.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>Madison</p><p>I pull up to Pax and Mila\u2019s home and sit in the drive for a minute, simply enjoying the chirp of the summer crickets and the soft rustling of the breeze coming off the water. After the baby\u2019s emergency delivery, I thought it would take a while for life to get back to normal, but that hasn\u2019t been true.</p><p>Pax and Mila brought the baby home from the hospital a few days ago and everything has been fine. Mila has completely recovered, the baby is healthy and strong. We\u2019re all more resilient than I ever would have thought.</p><p>After I jog up the steps and poke my head in the door, I immediately hear the baby wailing and Pax shouting to Mila.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do! She puked everywhere!\u201d</p><p>I giggle and walk on in, taking the baby from Pax as he looks at me in relief.</p><p>\u201cMila\u2019s in the shower,\u201d he tells me sheepishly. \u201cI just changed the baby, but I didn\u2019t do it right. Her diaper fell off and then she threw up.\u201d</p><p>I lay the baby down and refasten the Velcro tabs on her diaper, then strip off her little shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou almost had it,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t tight enough. You\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>He hands me a clean shirt and I slide it onto the baby, then cradle her in my arms. Pax doesn\u2019t even bother holding out his hands for her, because he knows that while I\u2019m here, I\u2019m not giving her up. I hold her close and inhale the sweet baby smell, breathing deeply.</p><p>\u201cAhhh. I love that,\u201d I sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s the best smell in the world, aside from rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Pax says as he settles into a chair in the living room and closes his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so fricking tired, Mad. Your niece was up a lot last night.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, taking in his exhausted face. \u201cGo ahead and rest. I\u2019ll watch the baby till Mila gets out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best,\u201d he breathes, settling in for a nap.</p><p>I leap from my seat and hug Pax tightly, wrapping my arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cNo, you are,\u201d I whisper to him. \u201cYou really are. Thank you for taking such good care of my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where that came from, but you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He pats my back and as he does, Mila comes in, toweling off her hair.</p><p>\u201cGeesh, guys. Get a room.\u201d She rolls her eyes, then grins at me. \u201cDid you come to babysit so I can take a nap?\u201d</p><p>The hopeful tone in her voice makes me laugh. \u201cI came to tell you something, but sure, I can stay for a while to watch the baby.\u201d</p><p>Mila looks curious. \u201cWhat do you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>I motion to the sofa. \u201cCan you sit?\u201d</p><p>Mila looks worried, but does as I ask. When we\u2019re facing each other, I pick up her hands.</p><p>\u201cMi, I know that after Mom and Dad died, we couldn\u2019t bring ourselves to give up the Hill. I came home to run it and I think I\u2019ve done a pretty good job.\u201d I pause and she nods, hesitant. Pax looks knowing, like he\u2019s guessed what I\u2019m going to say.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t do it anymore, Mila. I feel like I\u2019m living someone else\u2019s life. Even though I completely renovated the cottage, it still feels like I\u2019ve stepped into Mom and Dad\u2019s life and taken it over. I\u2019ve got to have my own. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nods slowly. \u201cI do. I definitely do. But what are you saying? What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI want to sell the Hill. And I want to sell the cottage. I\u2019m thinking... and I know this might seem crazy, but I think I might want to move to Hartford and open up a restaurant there. It turns out that I\u2019m pretty good at running one. But I just can\u2019t do it here. There\u2019s too many memories... Dad, Mom, Tony. I just... I can\u2019t. Do you hate me?\u201d</p><p>Mila throws her arms around my neck, practically smothering me. \u201cOf course not! You\u2019re going to move to Hartford with us? You\u2019d do that? Oh my God. I\u2019m so glad. I would\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>My eyes well up. \u201cI know. I just need a fresh start. A new life. But I don\u2019t want to do that too far away from you.\u201d</p><p>She sniffles and I sniffle and Pax throws his arms around both of us, smashing us both together.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s gonna be all right, Maddy,\u201d Mila tells me, tearfully. But they\u2019re happy tears now, thank God. \u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know. I really think it is.\u201d</p><p>Pax finally lets go of us and they stand up.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind watching Madelyn for a bit?\u201d Mila asks, covering up a yawn.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cOf course not. I\u2019m going to be her favorite aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her only aunt,\u201d Pax points out. But the effect is lost because he yells it over his shoulder as they practically sprint to their bedroom to nap.</p><p>I have to chuckle at that. I\u2019ve always heard stories of sleep-deprived parents, but having seen it firsthand, I know how desperate they are for sleep.</p><p>Madelyn actually falls asleep shortly after they do, which I find ironic. I hold her for a long time as she naps, just breathing in her sweet baby smell, and pondering everything that\u2019s happened over the past couple of weeks.</p><p>I miss Tony. I miss him every day. But Maria is doing OK and Sophia went back to school. They\u2019re doing as well as they can, and time will continue to heal them. And the rest of us.</p><p>Maybe everything really will be OK.</p><p>On a warm summer evening, I come home from meeting with a realtor about selling the Hill to find Gabe sitting at the dining room table, a piece of paper in his hands and a strange look on his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask curiously. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me. \u201cDo you remember me telling you that when I was in CPT, I wrote a letter to Ara Sahar\u2019s parents? It was the therapist\u2019s idea and I went along with it. I didn\u2019t really expect much to come out of it because hell\u2014I didn\u2019t even know if her parents were still alive. But the army had it translated into Arabic and they located her parents. They answered me.\u201d He holds up the paper.</p><p>I can\u2019t read his face, it\u2019s entirely expressionless.</p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d I ask hesitantly, almost afraid to look.</p> <p>He nods, handing it to me, and I glance down at the wrinkled letter.</p><p>Dear Lieutenant Vincent,</p><p>Thank you very much for your recent letter.</p><p>At first I did not know how to respond because our hearts have been so very broken, into a million tiny pieces. But you are a soldier who came here to help people like me and children like Ara, and so I thought you must surely deserve an answer.</p><p>Even though putting this pen to this paper hurts my heart, there are several things you should know.</p> <p>You should know that it wasn\u2019t your fault that my Ara was taken. My country has been torn apart by terrible things, evil things, none of which are your fault or your making. Each day, I would wake, afraid that that day would be the day when something would hurt Ara. Now that it is finally done, I no longer must worry. Nothing can harm her anymore. She\u2019s in Allah\u2019s arms now, safe and warm.</p><p>You should know that even in the midst of terrible evil, good flourishes, even still. You are good. You rose above the evil here and fought hard for good. Ara knew that. She used to watch the US soldiers pass and she would say to me, \u201cThey\u2019re here to protect us, Mama.\u201d She saw that in you. She saw that in all of you.</p><p>Lieutenant Vincent, you should know that you did not take my daughter from me. Even the evil here did not take her from me because she is not really gone. She is still my daughter and I am still her mama. Love is deathless, you see. And one day, I will be with her again. I will breathe in her hair and her sweet smell and she will smile at me and then I will be whole again. Someday.</p><p>Lieutenant Vincent, you should know that Ara does not blame you. I know that with every breath that is left in me. That is not who my daughter was, that is not who she is. She would wish you nothing but peace. Please do not weep for her. Ara is with angels. I think she is watching over you now, just as you watched over her when you were here. Even if you didn\u2019t know it, or her, you fought for her.</p><p>She knew that.</p><p>Lieutenant Vincent, you should know that you cannot hate yourself any longer. It was not your fault. You must forgive yourself.</p> <p>Lieutenant Vincent, you should know that I have forgiven you.</p><p>May peace be upon you,</p><p>Pashka Sahar</p><p>My breath freezes in my throat as tears fall down my cheeks.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t blame Gabriel. Even through her veil of overwhelming grief, she has forgiven him.</p><p>In my head I picture a little Afghan girl and her grieving mother and all I can do is sit and marvel at Pashka Sahar\u2019s beautiful spirit amid all the ugliness around her. I read her words again and my heart breaks a little bit more with every word.</p><p>\u201cShe forgives you, Gabe,\u201d I tell him softly. \u201cNow you have to forgive yourself. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Gabe opens his mouth to speak, then closes it and lowers his head onto his arms on the table.</p> <p>Then he weeps.</p><p>After everything we\u2019ve been through, I\u2019ve never seen Gabriel cry.</p><p>It breaks my heart and everything from the past few months seems to crash down around us as I pad across the floor and pull him into my arms and onto the floor with me. I cradle him in my lap and let him cry.</p><p>I know it\u2019s not just the letter that he is crying over. It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s Ara Sahar, it\u2019s Mad Dog, it\u2019s his old life that he has lost, it\u2019s the heavy guilt that he has carried. It\u2019s all of it.</p><p>It\u2019s everything that he has never let himself properly grieve for.</p><p>\u201cShhhh,\u201d I soothe him, stroking his back. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. Let it go, Gabe. Even the strongest cry. A smart person told me that once.\u201d</p><p>I stroke his strong arms with my fingers, tracing each line and muscle until finally he falls silent and turns over, staring up at me.</p><p>I dip my head to press my lips against his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hero, Gabe,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYou really are. You don\u2019t need to carry this anymore. No more guilt, no more sadness. Like Pashka said, you couldn\u2019t have prevented it. Ara wouldn\u2019t want you to carry this burden anymore.\u201d</p><p>He flips over and pulls me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Madison Hill,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve never cried before. I should be embarrassed, but I\u2019m not. I love you for not judging my weakness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not weak, Gabe,\u201d I answer softly. \u201cYou\u2019re far, far from weak. You\u2019re one of the reasons why normal people like me sleep well at night. It\u2019s because we can. You face danger so that we don\u2019t have to. Even little Ara knew that. You think that you\u2019re a bad thing, but you\u2019re not. You protect the rest of us from bad things. You\u2019re badass and lethal and scary, and you\u2019re as far from weak as you can get. You\u2019re a protector, Gabe. My protector.\u201d</p><p>He looks stunned, then satisfied. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I nod and we just sit in silence for a while.</p><p>Nothing more really needs to be said. Everything hangs in the air around us, reverent and beautiful and strong. Words aren\u2019t needed for us to feel it.</p><p>Eventually we get off the floor and drink a bottle of wine, quietly enjoying each other\u2019s presence before we finally head to bed.</p><p>As we lie in the quiet darkness, emotionally drained and tired, Gabe finally speaks.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I\u2019ve been thinking about something. I don\u2019t want to go to Hartford with things as they are.\u201d</p><p>Every ounce of my being freezes with his words.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d I manage to get out.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNo. We\u2019ve been through so much shit, Maddy. To hell and back, actually. I don\u2019t want to move to Hartford with you as my girlfriend. I want to move there with you as my wife.\u201d</p><p>The world stops again, like it has a hundred times since I met him.</p><p>I stare at him in the dark, my hand limp on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d My voice is a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he tells me. \u201cMaddy, I know you\u2019re probably scared of marriage because of your parents\u2019. But I can promise you that ours would be as different from theirs as night and day. I will love you every day of my life. Anything that wants to hurt you will have to come through me to do it. Fear is a choice, Maddy. Don\u2019t be afraid of this. Marry me. Please.\u201d</p><p>My answer is instant. I don\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I breathe. \u201cI want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he mutters as he pulls me to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how else I was going to convince you if you said no.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, tracing my fingers along his face, his jaw, his neck.</p><p>\u201cAnd you really don\u2019t mind moving to Hartford with me?\u201d I ask, for the fourteenth time this week.</p><p>\u201cMaddy, I would go anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>His arms tighten around me and I hear the thrumming of his heart, solid and loud. I whisper loud enough that he can hear me over the crash of the lake outside.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me tonight, Gabe. Stay with me all night.\u201d</p><p>Out of habit he startles at the thought, but then he relaxes and finally nods.</p><p>A thrill runs through me at his words.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Maybe it\u2019s time. We can\u2019t get married if we can\u2019t even sleep together, right?\u201d</p><p>Relief floods through me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely time,\u201d I tell him. I relax, fitting into him perfectly. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting married either way.\u201d He chuckles and I drift toward sleep, enjoying the sense of security and love that washes over me in Gabe\u2019s arms.</p><p>As sleep overtakes me, I know that I\u2019ll never want to be anywhere else more than I want to be right here with him.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>The night passes peacefully.</p><p>When I wake in the morning with the sun in my face, I turn to Gabe and find him watching me, his sexy dark eyes thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cDid you dream?\u201d I ask nervously. He grins, the slow grin that I love, the one that spreads from his lips to his eyes as he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNot one nightmare. I think maybe I\u2019ve kicked that demon\u2019s ass after all.\u201d</p><p>I reach for him, pulling him to me, enjoying the way his body covers mine. One thing is certainly true, this man is my own personal hero.</p><p>As I look into his eyes and see the promises that linger there, I can\u2019t help but think about another truth.</p><p>Fear really is a choice.</p><p>And we both faced ours and won.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of anymore.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>One Year Later</p><p>Arlington, Virginia</p><p>Gabriel</p><p>The rows of white headstones seem to go on for miles and miles in the quiet cemetery. But only one matters right now.</p><p>The one I\u2019m standing in front of.</p><p>Marshall Elijah Crane.</p><p>Mad Dog.</p><p>Brand bends down on one knee, wiping the slight layer of dust from the headstone. Of course it doesn\u2019t say Mad Dog. It spells out his full name and his rank in plain block letters. It doesn\u2019t say anything else about him.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t say that he was funny as shit, that he was loyal as hell or that he was scared to die, but faced it with honor anyway.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t say any of that.</p><p>\u201cHey, dude,\u201d Brand greets him quietly. \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and Madison jabs him in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks innocently. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna change how I talk to him just because he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hand out to Maddy and she hands me the box.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me what you did?\u201d she asks softly. \u201cWhy did you wait until they gave you this medal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad,\u201d Jacey pipes up. \u201cI didn\u2019t know either. I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t relevant.\u201d</p><p>Brand chuckles wryly. \u201cIt was relevant to me.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him and suddenly, instead of seeing him standing tall and proud as he is now, I see him bloody and unconscious. His leg was blown to bits and I had no idea if there was anything else coming for us. I did the only thing I could do.</p><p>I draped him over my back and I carried him.</p><p>\u201cYour husband carried me for two miles,\u201d Brand tells Maddy, his voice low. \u201cAfter the Humvee exploded, Taliban rebels stormed in from the perimeter to kill any survivors. He pulled me out of there and carried me to safety, through the hills and the sand and the smoke. They would\u2019ve killed me if he hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Maddy raises an eyebrow and leans into me. \u201cAnd you never found this important to mention until now? I sounded like an idiot when the Pentagon called to invite you to the awards ceremony. A little heads-up would\u2019ve been nice.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they were going to do that. Sorry about that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d she answers incredulously, as she pushes her hair out of her face. \u201cYou\u2019re a hero, Gabe. Everyone knows it but you. For months you only focused on what you didn\u2019t do that night. What you should\u2019ve been focusing on was what you did.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, meeting her gaze. \u201cI know,\u201d I answer.</p><p>And finally it\u2019s true. I do know. I know that I couldn\u2019t have stopped what happened that night. It wasn\u2019t my fault. The failure wasn\u2019t mine.</p><p>It\u2019s something that\u2019s taken me quite a while, but I\u2019m at peace with it now.</p> <p>Because the wheels of the government turn slowly, it wasn\u2019t until a month ago that we got the call. They wanted to honor Brand and me for that night. Brand with the Purple Heart and me with the Medal of Honor.</p><p>A medal for outstanding valor in the face of great peril, above and beyond the call of duty. That\u2019s what the president said to me today as he hung the blue ribbon around my neck.</p><p>Maddy and Jacey sat in the front row and cried.</p><p>And Mad Dog\u2019s wife was there next to them. It took her months. But time and a letter from Maddy made her understand that I would\u2019ve given my life to save Mad Dog\u2019s.</p><p>And I would\u2019ve.</p> <p>But that\u2019s not how it happened. So I\u2019m here today to honor his memory in the only way I can.</p><p>Kneeling, I drape the blue ribbon around the top of his headstone.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let this go to your head,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Of course he\u2019s not here to hear me. But somehow, with the quiet reverence of this place, it seems almost possible that he is. That he\u2019s standing behind me with a bottle of Mad Dog in his hand, laughing as I leave my medal with a dead man.</p><p>But that\u2019s OK.</p><p>It belongs here.</p> <p>I need to leave it behind, along with everything else that happened that night. I don\u2019t want to think about it anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to leave it here?\u201d Maddy asks gently.</p><p>I nod. \u201cI don\u2019t need a piece of metal to tell me who I am.\u201d</p><p>She smiles, gorgeous and warm, as her hand flutters down to her stomach, where our baby is just barely beginning to show.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling OK?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt\u2019s hot. Do you need some water?\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m good, babe. Ask me again in a few months. Right now I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Brand wraps one arm around her shoulders and the other around Jacey\u2019s. Together the four of us stand for a second, soaking in the quiet, silently paying tribute to all the fallen soldiers around us. I know that Brand is thinking the same thing I am. It could very easily have been us buried here beneath the dirt and the grass.</p><p>But it\u2019s not.</p> <p>\u201cIf the baby is a boy, I want to name him Elijah,\u201d I finally say to Maddy. \u201cIs that OK?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes well up and she nods. \u201cAs long as his middle name is Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Warmth floods through me. \u201cDeal,\u201d I manage to say, lacing my fingers through hers.</p><p>\u201cYou might not want to talk about it,\u201d she tells me gently. \u201cBut our son will hear about what a hero you are. Just so you know that.\u201d</p><p>She lets go of my hand, gripping my arm instead, and I think about the words beneath her fingers.</p><p>Death before dishonor.</p><p>Mad Dog is dead and there is nothing I can do about that. He died with honor. Along with Ara Sahar and all those other women and children. But I\u2019m still alive. So there\u2019s only one thing I can do. Live for them.</p><p>Live with honor.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Brand asks, glancing at me.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>And finally I am.</p><p>We walk away together, leaving the past behind us where it belongs. </p> </body></html>"]
