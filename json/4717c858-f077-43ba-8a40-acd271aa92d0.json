Constant contact with the races who continued to embrace emotion made it much harder to hold on to their own conditioning.</p><p>It was a logical thought.</p><p>However, it proved impossible in practice. Economics alone made isolation an unfeasible goal\u2014Psy might have all been linked into the PsyNet, the sprawling psychic network that anchored their minds, but they were not all equal. Some were rich, some were poor, and some were just getting by.</p> <p>They needed jobs, needed money, needed food. And the Psy Council, for all its brutal power, could not provide enough internal positions for millions. The Psy had to remain part of the world, a world filled with chaos on every side, bursting at the seams with the extremes of joy and sadness, fear and despair. Those Psy who fractured under the pressure were quietly \u201crehabilitated,\u201d their minds wiped, their personalities erased. But others thrived.</p><p>The M-Psy, gifted with the ability to look inside the body and diagnose illnesses, had never really withdrawn from the world. Their skills were prized by all three races, and they brought in a good income.</p><p>The less-powerful members of the Psy populace returned to their ordinary, everyday jobs as accountants and engineers, shop owners and businessmen. Except that what they had once enjoyed, despised, or merely tolerated, they now simply did.</p><p>The most powerful, in contrast, were absorbed into the Council superstructure wherever possible. The Council did not want to chance losing its strongest.</p><p>Then there were the Js.</p> <p>Telepaths born with a quirk that allowed them to slip into minds and retrieve memories, then share those memories with others, the Js had been part of the world\u2019s justice system since the world first had one. There weren\u2019t enough J-Psy to shed light on the guilt or innocence of every accused\u2014they were brought in on only the most heinous cases: the kinds of cases that made veteran detectives throw up and long-jaded reporters take a horrified step backward.</p><p>Realizing how advantageous it would be to have an entr\u00e9e into a system that processed both humans, and at times, the secretive and pack-natured changelings as well, the Council allowed the Js to not just continue, but expand their work. Now, in the dawn of the year 2081, the Js are so much a part of the Justice system that their presence raises no eyebrows, causes no ripples.</p><p>And, as for the unexpected mental consequences of long-term work as a J . . . well, the benefits outweigh the occasional murderous problem.</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Circumstance doesn\u2019t make a man. If it did, I\u2019d have committed my first burglary at twelve, my first robbery at fifteen, and my first murder at seventeen.</p><p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p> <p>It was as she was sitting staring into the face of a sociopath that Sophia Russo realized three irrefutable truths.</p><p>One: In all likelihood, she had less than a year left before she was sentenced to comprehensive rehabilitation. Unlike normal rehabilitation, the process wouldn\u2019t only wipe out her personality, leave her a drooling vegetable. Comprehensives had ninety-nine percent of their psychic senses fried as well. All for their own good of course.</p><p>Two: Not a single individual on this earth would remember her name after she disappeared from active duty.</p><p>Three: If she wasn\u2019t careful, she would soon end up as empty and as inhuman as the man on the other side of the table . . . because the otherness in her wanted to squeeze his mind until he whimpered, until he bled, until he begged for mercy.</p><p>Evil is hard to define, but it\u2019s sitting in that room.</p><p>The echo of Detective Max Shannon\u2019s words pulled her back from the whispering temptation of the abyss. For some reason, the idea of being labeled evil by him was . . . not acceptable. He had looked at her in a different way from other human males, his eyes noting her scars, but only as part of the package that was her body. The response had been extraordinary enough to make her pause, meet his gaze, attempt to divine what he was thinking.</p><p>That had proved impossible. But she knew what Max Shannon wanted.</p><p>Bonner alone knows where he buried the bodies\u2014we need that information.</p> <p>Shutting the door on the darkness inside of her, she opened her psychic eye and, reaching out with her telepathic senses, began to walk the twisted pathways of Gerard Bonner\u2019s mind. She had touched many, many depraved minds over the course of her career, but this one was utterly and absolutely unique. Many who committed crimes of this caliber had a mental illness of some kind. She understood how to work with their sometimes disjointed and fragmented memories.</p><p>Bonner\u2019s mind, in contrast, was neat, organized, each memory in its proper place. Except those places and the memories they contained made no sense, having been filtered through the cold lens of his sociopathic desires. He saw things as he wished to see them, the reality distorted until it was impossible to pinpoint the truth among the spiderweb of lies.</p><p>Ending the telepathic sweep, she took three discreet seconds to center herself before opening her physical eyes to stare into the rich blue irises of the man the media found so compelling. According to them, he was handsome, intelligent, magnetic. What she knew for a fact was that he held an MBA from a highly regarded institution and came from one of the premier human families in Boston\u2014there was a prevailing sense of disbelief that he was also the Butcher of Park Avenue, the moniker coined after the discovery of Carissa White\u2019s body along one of the avenue\u2019s famous wide \u201cgreen\u201d medians.</p><p>Covered with tulips and daffodils in spring, it had been a snowy wonderland of trees and fairy lights when Carissa was dumped there, her blood a harsh accent on the snow. She was the only one of Bonner\u2019s victims to have ever been found, and the public nature of the dump site had turned her killer into an instant star. It had also almost gotten him caught\u2014only the fact that the witness who\u2019d seen him running from the scene had been too far away to give Enforcement any kind of a useful description had saved the monster.</p><p>\u201cI got much more careful after that,\u201d Bonner said, wearing the faint smile that made people think they were being invited to share a secret joke. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a little clumsy the first time.\u201d</p><p>Sophia betrayed no reaction to the fact that the human across from her had just \u201cread her mind,\u201d having expected the trick. According to his file, Gerard Bonner was a master manipulator, able to read body language cues and minute facial expressions to genius-level accuracy. Even Silence, it seemed, was not protection enough against his abilities\u2014having reviewed the visual transcripts of his trial, she\u2019d seen him do the same thing to other Psy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here, Mr. Bonner,\u201d she said with a calm that was growing ever colder, ever more remote\u2014a survival mechanism that would soon chill the few remaining splinters of her soul. \u201cYou agreed to give up the locations of your later victims\u2019 bodies in return for more privileges during your incarceration.\u201d Bonner\u2019s sentence meant he\u2019d be spending the rest of his natural life in D2, a maximum security facility located deep in the mountainous interior of Wyoming. Created under a special mandate, D2 housed the most vicious inmates from around the country, those deemed too high risk to remain in the normal prison system.</p><p>\u201cI like your eyes,\u201d Bonner said, his smile widening as he traced the network of fine lines on her face with a gaze the media had labeled \u201cmurderously sensual.\u201d \u201cThey remind me of pansies.\u201d</p><p>Sophia simply waited, letting him speak, knowing his words would be of interest to the profilers who stood in the room on the other side of the wall at her back\u2014observing her meeting with Bonner on a large comm screen. Unusually for a human criminal, there were Psy observers in that group. Bonner\u2019s mental patterns were so aberrant as to incite their interest.</p><p>But no matter the credentials of those Psy profilers, Max Shannon\u2019s conclusions were the ones that interested Sophia. The Enforcement detective had no Psy abilities, and unlike the butcher sitting across from her, his body was whipcord lean. Sleek, she thought, akin to a lithely muscled puma. Yet, when it came down to it, it was the puma who\u2019d won\u2014both over the bulging strength that strained at Bonner\u2019s prison overalls, and over the mental abilities of the Psy detectives who\u2019d been enlisted into the task force once Bonner\u2019s perversions began to have a serious economic impact.</p><p>\u201cThey were my pansies, you know.\u201d A small sigh. \u201cSo pretty, so sweet. So easily bruised. Like you.\u201d His eyes lingered on a scar that ran a ragged line over her cheekbone.</p><p>Ignoring the blatant attempt at provocation, she said, \u201cWhat did you do to bruise them?\u201d Bonner had ultimately been convicted on the basis of the evidence he\u2019d left on the battered and broken body of his first victim. He hadn\u2019t left a trace at the scenes of the other abductions, had been connected to them only by the most circumstantial of evidence\u2014and Max Shannon\u2019s relentless persistence.</p><p>\u201cSo delicate and so damaged you are, Sophia,\u201d he murmured, moving his gaze across her cheek, down to her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve always been drawn to damaged women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie, Mr. Bonner.\u201d It was extraordinary to her that people found him handsome\u2014when she could all but smell the rot. \u201cEvery one of your victims was remarkably beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlleged victims,\u201d he said, eyes sparkling. \u201cI was only convicted of poor Carissa\u2019s murder. Though I\u2019m innocent, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou agreed to cooperate,\u201d she reminded him. And she needed that cooperation to do her job. Because\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve learned to control your thought patterns to a certain degree.\u201d It was something the telepaths in the J-Corps had noted in a number of human sociopaths\u2014they seemed to develop an almost Psy ability to consciously manipulate their own memories. Bonner had learned to do it well enough that she couldn\u2019t get what she needed from a surface scan\u2014to go deeper, dig harder might cause permanent damage, erasing the very impressions she needed to access. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But, the otherness in her murmured, he only had to remain alive until they located his victims. After that . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d Exaggerated surprise. \u201cI\u2019m sure they told you\u2014my memory\u2019s not what it used to be. That\u2019s why I need a J to go in and dig up my pansies.\u201d</p><p>It was a game. She was certain he knew the exact position of each discarded body down to the last centimeter of dirt on a shallow grave. But he\u2019d played the game well enough that the authorities had pulled her in, giving Bonner the chance to sate his urges once again. By making her go into his mind, he was attempting to violate her\u2014the sole way he had to hurt a woman now.</p> <p>\u201cSince it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m ineffective,\u201d she said, rising to her feet, \u201cI\u2019ll get Justice to send in my colleague, Bryan Ames. He\u2019s an\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The first trace of a crack in his polished veneer, covered over almost as soon as it appeared. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get what you need.\u201d</p><p>She tugged at the thin black leather-synth of her left glove, smoothing it over her wrist so it sat neatly below the cuff of her crisp white shirt. \u201cI\u2019m too expensive a resource to waste. My skills will be better utilized in other cases.\u201d Then she walked out, ignoring his order\u2014and it was an order\u2014that she stay.</p><p>Once out in the observation chamber, she turned to Max Shannon. \u201cMake sure any replacements you send him are male.\u201d</p><p>A professional nod, but his hand clenched on the top of the chairback beside him, his skin having the warm golden brown tone of someone whose ancestry appeared to be a mix of Asian and Caucasian. While the Asian side of his genetic structure had made itself known in the shape of his eyes, the Caucasian side had won in the height department\u2014he was six foot one according to her visual estimate.</p> <p>All that was fact.</p><p>But the impact was more than the sum of its parts. He had, she realized, that strange something the humans called charisma. Psy professed not to accept that such a thing existed, but they all knew it did. Even among their Silent race, there were those who could walk into a room and hold it with nothing but their presence.</p><p>As she watched, Max\u2019s tendons turned white against his skin from the force of his grip. \u201cHe got his rocks off making you trawl through his memories.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything about her scars, but Sophia knew as well as he did that they played a large part in what made her so very attractive to Bonner.</p><p>Those scars had long ago become a part of her, a thin tracery of lines that spoke of a history, a past. Without them, she\u2019d have no past at all. Max Shannon, she thought, had a past as well. But he didn\u2019t wear it on that beautiful\u2014not handsome, beautiful\u2014face. \u201cI have shields.\u201d However, those shields were beginning to fail, an inevitable side effect of her occupation. If she\u2019d had the option, she wouldn\u2019t have become a J. But at eight years of age, she\u2019d been given a single choice\u2014become a J or die.</p><p>\u201cI heard a lot of J-Psy have eidetic memories,\u201d Max said, his eyes intent.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but only when it comes to the images we take during the course of our work.\u201d She\u2019d forgotten parts of her \u201creal life,\u201d but she\u2019d never forget even an instant of the things she\u2019d seen over the years she\u2019d spent in the Justice Corps.</p> <p>Max had opened his mouth to reply when Bartholomew Reuben, the prosecutor who\u2019d worked side by side with him to capture and convict Gerard Bonner, finished his conversation with two of the profilers and walked over. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea about male Js. It\u2019ll give Bonner time to stew\u2014we can bring you in again when he\u2019s in a more cooperative frame of mind.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s jaw set at a brutal angle as he responded. \u201cHe\u2019ll draw this out as long as possible\u2014those girls are nothing but pawns to him.\u201d</p><p>Reuben was pulled away by another profiler before he could reply, leaving Sophia alone with Max again. She found herself staying in place though she should\u2019ve joined those of her race, her task complete. But being perfect hadn\u2019t kept her safe\u2014she\u2019d be dead within the year, one way or another\u2014so why not indulge her desire for further conversation with this human detective whose mind worked in a fashion that fascinated her? \u201cHis ego won\u2019t let him hide his secrets forever,\u201d she said, having dealt with that kind of a narcissistic personality before. \u201cHe wants to share his cleverness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will you continue to listen if the first body he gives up is that of Daria Xiu?\u201d His tone was abrasive, gritty with lack of sleep.</p><p>Daria Xiu, Sophia knew, was the reason a J had been pulled into this situation. The daughter of a powerful human businessman, she was theorized to have been Bonner\u2019s final victim. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, telling him one truth. \u201cBonner is deviant enough that our psychologists find him a worthwhile study subject.\u201d Perhaps because the kind of deviancy exhibited by the Butcher of Park Avenue had once been exhibited by Psy in statistically high numbers . . . and was no longer being fully contained by Silence.</p><p>The Council thought the populace didn\u2019t know, and perhaps they didn\u2019t. But to Sophia, a J who\u2019d spent her life steeped in the miasma of evil, the new shadows in the PsyNet had a texture she could almost feel\u2014thick, oily, and beginning to riddle the fabric of the sprawling neural network with insidious efficiency.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d Max asked, watching her with a piercing focus that made her feel as if that quicksilver mind might uncover secrets she\u2019d kept concealed for over two decades. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>The otherness in her stirred, wanting to give him the unvarnished, deadly truth, but that was something she couldn\u2019t ever share with a man who\u2019d made Justice his life. \u201cI\u2019ll do my job.\u201d Then she said something a perfect Psy never would have said. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring them home. No one should have to spend eternity in the cold dark.\u201d</p> <p>Max watched Sophia Russo walk away with the civilian observers, unable to take his attention off her. It had been the eyes that had first slammed into him. River\u2019s eyes, he\u2019d thought as she walked in, she had River\u2019s eyes. But he\u2019d been wrong. Sophia\u2019s eyes were darker, more dramatically blue-violet, so vivid he\u2019d almost missed the lush softness of her mouth. Except he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>And that was one hell of a kick to the teeth.</p><p>Because for all her curves and the tracery of scars that spoke of a violent past, she was Psy. Ice-cold and tied to a Council that had far more blood on its hands than Gerard Bonner ever would. Except . . . Her final words circled in his mind.</p><p>We\u2019ll bring them home.</p><p>It had held the weight of a vow. Or maybe that\u2019s what he\u2019d wanted to hear.</p><p>Wrenching back his attention when she disappeared from view, he turned to Bart Reuben, the only other person who remained. \u201cShe wear the gloves all the time?\u201d Thin black leather-synth, they\u2019d covered everything below the cuffs of her shirt and suit jacket. It might have been because she had more serious scars on the backs of her hands\u2014but Sophia Russo didn\u2019t strike him as the kind of woman who\u2019d hide behind such a shield.</p><p>\u201cYes. Every time I\u2019ve seen her.\u201d Frown lines marred the prosecutor\u2019s forehead for a second, before he seemed to shake off whatever was bothering him. \u201cShe\u2019s got an excellent record\u2014never fumbled a retraction yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw at the trial that Bonner\u2019s smart enough to fuck with his own memories,\u201d Max said, watching as the prisoner was led from the interrogation room. The blue-eyed Butcher, the media\u2019s murderous darling, stared out at the cameras until the door closed, his smile a silent taunt. \u201cEven if his mind isn\u2019t twisted at the core, he knows his pharmaceuticals\u2014could\u2019ve got his hands on something, deliberately dosed himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t put it past the bastard,\u201d Bart said, the grooves around his mouth carved deep. \u201cI\u2019ll line up a couple of male Js for Bonner\u2019s next little show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXiu have that much clout?\u201d The trial of Gerard Bonner, scion of a blue-blooded Boston family and the most sadistic killer the state had seen in decades, would\u2019ve qualified for a J at the trial stage but for the fact that his memories were close to impenetrable.</p><p>\u201cSociopaths,\u201d one J had said to Max after testifying that he couldn\u2019t retrieve anything usable from the accused\u2019s mind, \u201cdon\u2019t see the truth as others see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example,\u201d Max had asked, frustrated that the killer who\u2019d snuffed out so many young lives had managed to slither through another net.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the memories in Bonner\u2019s surface mind, Carissa White orgasmed as he stabbed her.\u201d</p><p>Shaking off that sickening evidence of Bonner\u2019s warped reality, he glanced at Bart, who\u2019d paused to check an e-mail on his cell phone. \u201cXiu?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, looks like he has some \u2018friends\u2019 in high-level Psy ranks. His company does a lot of business with them.\u201d Putting away the phone, Bart began to gather up his papers. \u201cBut in this, he\u2019s just a shattered father. Daria was his only child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The face of each and every victim was imprinted on Max\u2019s mind. Twenty-one-year-old Daria\u2019s was a gap-toothed smile, masses of curly black hair, and skin the color of polished mahogany. She didn\u2019t look anything like the other victims\u2014unlike most killers of his pathology, Bonner hadn\u2019t differentiated between white, black, Hispanic, Asian. It had only been age and a certain kind of beauty that drew him.</p><p>Which turned his thoughts back to the woman who\u2019d stared unblinking into the face of a killer while Max forced himself to stand back, to watch. \u201cShe fits his victim profile\u2014Ms. Russo.\u201d Sophia Russo\u2019s eyes, her scars, made her strikingly unique\u2014a critical aspect of Bonner\u2019s pathology. He\u2019d targeted women who would never blend into a crowd\u2014the violence spoken of by Sophia\u2019s scars would, for him, be the icing on the cake. \u201cDid you arrange that?\u201d His hand tightened on a pen as he helped Bart clear the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStroke of luck.\u201d The prosecutor put the files in his briefcase. \u201cWhen Bonner said he\u2019d cooperate with a scan, we requested the closest J.

She was taken directly to an interview room upon arrival. The assistant district attorney in charge of the case arrived a minute later.</p><p>Five minutes after that, she began the memory retrieval. Unlike Bonner\u2019s, this inmate\u2019s mind was full of nothing but forty years of living and violence. Some young Js got lost in the mess, but Sophia had learned to filter very well. She went directly to the memories of the day in question and took no more than the relevant minutes.</p><p>Humans tended to be suspicious of telepaths, and Js in particular, afraid the Psy would steal their secrets. The truth was, Sophia already had too many pieces of other people\u2019s lives in her head. She didn\u2019t want any more\u2014especially the kinds of memories she was invariably asked to retrieve. In all her years of service, she\u2019d found only four innocents. \u201cI have it,\u201d she said to the A.D.A.</p> <p>Asking the prisoner and his attorney to wait, he walked her to the waiting area outside the warden\u2019s office. \u201cCould you project the memories to me?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she did as asked. This little telepathic quirk was what turned a Tp into a J. Most telepaths could transmit words and/or isolated visuals, but Js could not only retract, but transmit the entire memory in a continuous stream. This A.D.A. was human, his shields no barrier. That could have been a handicap in other circumstances\u2014however, given that this case had no associated cost or benefit to the Council, he was safe from Psy coercion.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said after she completed the projection. \u201cThat does put a different spin on things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, aware he wasn\u2019t talking to her. And even if he had been, she would\u2019ve made no response. She tried not to \u201csee\u201d the memories anymore. It was a futile effort, but sometimes, she could distance herself a fraction.</p><p>The A.D.A. released a breath. \u201cI\u2019d like to go back and chat with the witness and his attorney. The jet-chopper will be arriving to take you back to the mainland soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease go ahead.\u201d She saw him looking around for the warden. \u201cThis location is tightly guarded. I\u2019ll be safe on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d A concerned look.</p><p>\u201cI spend a lot of time in prisons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess you must at that. Alright, you\u2019ve got my secretary\u2019s number. Give her a buzz if the chopper doesn\u2019t arrive in the next ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Nodding good-bye as he left, she took a seat, outwardly calm. But the truth was, she should\u2019ve never, ever been left alone. As she\u2019d told the A.D.A., it wasn\u2019t because her physical position put her at risk. There were at least four double-keyed electronic security doors, full of bars and steel, between her and the first inmate.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t even because she might get scared sitting alone in such a cold, gray place.</p><p>She had witnessed thousands of moments of the most depraved violence and pain, but she herself didn\u2019t feel fear. She didn\u2019t feel anything. The Silence Protocol, the conditioning that chilled Psy madnesses as it chilled their emotions, ensured that. However, in Sophia\u2019s case, Silence didn\u2019t work as well as it should. And everybody knew it. Most Psy would have been summarily rehabilitated, but Sophia was a Justice Psy. And Js were rare enough and necessary enough that they were allowed their little . . . peculiarities.</p><p>Of course, Js were also never to be left alone in \u201csuggestive\u201d locations.</p><p>Evil is hard to define, but it\u2019s sitting in that room.</p><p>The reminder of Max Shannon\u2019s grim words stayed her hand for a second. Would he consider this evil? Perhaps. But as her path was unlikely to ever again cross with that of a man who\u2019d made her, for a fleeting instant, wish to be something better, she couldn\u2019t let him guide her actions. Because though what she was about to do wasn\u2019t in any official manual, like all Js, she considered it part of her job description.</p><p>The first scream came four minutes later. In spite of its shrill, piercing nature, no one heard it. Because the man who was screaming was doing so soundlessly, his mind locked in a telepathic prison far more invidious than the plascrete and mortar one that surrounded him on every side.</p><p>Even as he screamed, he was moving, unzipping his pants, pushing them down to his ankles, shuffling over to pick up a tool he\u2019d hidden in the hollow leg of the desk his attorney had won for him. The inmate was a learned man, his attorney had argued; it constituted cruel and unusual punishment to put him in a place where he couldn\u2019t write, couldn\u2019t keep his research notes. The attorney had never mentioned the tiny, helpless victim his learned client had put in a dog cage devoid of the most basic of human necessities.</p><p>However, the amenities he had taken such glee in winning were the furthest things from the inmate\u2019s mind at that moment. His hand clenched on the tool as he blubbered without voice, his will shredded like so much paper. Then the tool touched the flaccid white of his belly and he realized what he was about to do.</p><p>Blood dripped onto the floor almost a minute after that\u2014it took time to achieve that kind of damage with nothing but a shiv, a weapon made out of a toothbrush ground against contraband rocks until its edges were as sharp as . . . well, almost a knife.</p><p>The act of amputation was excruciatingly painful.</p><p>And it was long over by the time a short, compact man with black hair faintly touched with silver walked into the waiting room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the delay, Ms. Russo. Your jet-chopper arrived five minutes ago, but I wasn\u2019t immediately able to spare an escort\u2014several prisoners decided to get into a ruckus in the yard.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stood, briefcase held loosely in her left hand. \u201cThat\u2019s quite alright, Warden.\u201d The otherness in her settled back, its task complete. \u201cI\u2019m still on schedule.\u201d</p><p>Warden Odess escorted her through the first set of security doors. \u201cThis is what, your third visit here this month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings going well on this new case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She paused as he cleared them through the second to last checkpoint. \u201cThe prosecution team feels certain of success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they\u2019ve got an ace in the hole with you. Pretty hard to argue innocence when you guys can pick the memories out of the accused\u2019s mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sophia agreed. \u201cHowever, insanity or diminished responsibility pleas are quite popular in such cases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so. You can\u2019t see into their heads, right? I mean\u2014know what they were thinking at the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by reference to their actions or words,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cIf those actions or words contain any hint of ambiguity, the field is thrown wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, of course, the defense always argues that things weren\u2019t as they appear.\u201d Snorting, the warden stepped out into the crisp light of the late winter\u2019s day. Sophia blinked as she, too, exited. The light seemed too bright today, too intense, cutting across her retinas like broken glass.</p><p>Odess watched as she blinked. \u201cGuess it\u2019s time for you to go in.\u201d</p><p>Most people didn\u2019t know that Js only worked one-month rotations before returning to the nearest branch of the Center to have their Silence checked. But Odess had been part of the prison system for over a decade. \u201cHow do you always know?\u201d she asked, having worked with him sporadically over those ten years.</p><p>\u201cThat question is your answer.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head a little to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou begin to act more human,\u201d he told her, his dark eyes holding a concern she\u2019d never understood. \u201cAt the start, when you\u2019ve just returned from wherever it is you go, your responses are short, distant. Now . . . we actually had a conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn astute observation,\u201d she said, realizing the tilt of her head for what it was\u2014a sign of disintegration. \u201cPerhaps we can have another conversation in a month\u2019s time.\u201d That was how long it would take for the conditioning to begin to fragment again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>Sophia walked to the waiting jet-chopper with an easy, unhurried stride. She was in Manhattan proper by the time they discovered the prisoner bleeding in his cell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max had spent the night going over the Bonner case files, on the slim chance that the bastard would actually give up a body at some stage. In truth, every single detail of the Butcher\u2019s crimes was already engraved on his memory banks, never to be erased, but he\u2019d wanted to be absolutely certain of his recall. All that death, the pain, coupled with the smug arrogance of the man who\u2019d ended so many lives\u2014it hadn\u2019t exactly left him in the best frame of mind for what had to be some kind of a Psy joke.</p><p>\u201cCommander,\u201d he said, staring into the aristocratic face of the Psy who ran New York Enforcement, \u201cif I can speak bluntly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rarely do otherwise, Detective Shannon.\u201d</p> <p>In most humans and changelings, Max would\u2019ve heard in that statement a wry humor. But Commander Brecht was Psy. He\u2019d look at a rape victim with the same dispassionate gaze as he would a drive-by-shooter.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Max said, pressing two fingers to the bridge of his nose, \u201cyou\u2019ll understand where I\u2019m coming from when I ask you why the hell you\u2019d put me on this. The Psy hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate is an emotion,\u201d Commander Brecht said from his standing position by an old-fashioned filing cabinet that had somehow survived all attempts at modernization. \u201cYou are more of an inconvenience.\u201d</p><p>Max felt his lips curve up in a humorless smile. At least you could never accuse Brecht of not cutting to the heart of the matter. \u201cExactly.\u201d He folded his arms over the crisp white shirt he\u2019d put on in preparation for a court appearance. \u201cWhy would you want an inconvenience running an investigation into a Psy situation?\u201d Psy were insular to the nth degree. They kept their secrets even as they stole those of others without pause or conscience. It pissed Max off, but all he could do was keep on doing his job. Sometimes, he won in spite of their interference\u2014and that made it all worth it.</p><p>\u201cYou have a natural mental shield.\u201d Commander Brecht\u2019s tone was straightforward. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re immune to Psy mental interference may have been a stumbling block when it comes to your career\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Max snorted. Fact was, with his solve rate and aptitude tests, he should\u2019ve made lieutenant by now. But he knew he never would\u2014Psy controlled Enforcement, and his ability to withstand their attempts at coercion, to run his cases as he saw fit, made him an unacceptable risk in any position of power.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d the commander continued, his hair solid gilt under the streak of light coming in through the tiny window to his left. \u201cWhile it may have been an obstacle in your path to a higher position within Enforcement, it is also an advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with that.\u201d Unlike so many humans, Max had never had to worry about whether he\u2019d closed a case or looked the other way as a result of subtle mental pressure\u2014many a good cop had broken because of that simmering kernel of doubt, that niggling concern that he\u2019d been led to a particular conclusion. He said as much to Brecht. \u201cI would\u2019ve gone into private investigation if I didn\u2019t have the shield\u2014staying here to get mind-fucked wouldn\u2019t have been at the top of my list.\u201d</p><p>The commander walked over to his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s beneficial for New York Enforcement that you decided to stay\u2014you have the best solve-rate in the city. And you\u2019re also, as the humans would say, mule stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Max had been called a rottweiler once in a while. He took it as a compliment. \u201cStill doesn\u2019t answer the question of why you\u2019d want me on a Psy case.\u201d Command always assigned those to Psy detectives.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t have a problem with that\u2014so long as it was only Psy who were involved. But it angered the hell out of him when humans and changelings got shortchanged because a member of the cold psychic race was part of the equation. \u201cThe Bonner situation\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs currently at an impasse according to the report you turned in last night. You\u2019re going to wait him out, correct?\u201d</p><p>Unfolding his arms, Max shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cI still need to be able to respond quickly if he does decide to talk\u2014I know this case like no one else.\u201d And though he\u2019d run the Butcher to ground, his task wasn\u2019t yet over\u2014wouldn\u2019t be over until he\u2019d brought each and every girl home, giving their grieving families the peace of being able to bury their babies in proper graves.</p><p>To this day, he could feel the slight weight of Carissa White\u2019s mother as she collapsed into his arms\u2014it had been a snowy winter\u2019s night when he\u2019d gone to their pristine little villa, a villa Carissa had decorated with twinkling Christmas lights two weeks earlier. Mrs. White had opened the door with a laugh. Later, she\u2019d gripped his jacket and begged him to tell her that it wasn\u2019t true, that Carissa was still alive.</p><p>And then she\u2019d made him promise. Find him. Find the monster who did this.</p><p>He\u2019d fulfilled that promise. But he\u2019d made other promises to other parents.</p><p>No one should have to spend eternity in the cold dark.</p><p>\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Brecht\u2019s words crashed through the echo of another Psy voice\u2014through the memory of a haunting statement so at odds with her glacial presence that Max hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her.</p><p>\u201cThe case I want you to work is high priority, but with room for flexibility should you need to fly back to consult on the Bonner case.\u201d Brecht slid into the chair behind his desk. \u201cIf you\u2019d take a seat, Detective.\u201d A pause when Max didn\u2019t immediately obey. \u201cYour obsession with Bonner ended with the capture of a sociopath who would undoubtedly have continued to take lives if you hadn\u2019t stopped his killing spree. However, if you let that obsession control you now, you\u2019ll wind up dead of stress while he grows fat behind bars.\u201d</p> <p>Max raised an eyebrow. \u201cBeen talking to the Enforcement shrink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be Psy, but I was also a detective.\u201d</p><p>And because Max had seen Brecht\u2019s case files, because he knew the man had been one hell of a smart cop, he took a seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you can\u2019t leave this room, whether or not you decide to accept the task.\u201d Brecht\u2019s eyes were a pale color between gray and blue, shards of ice encased in steel. \u201cDo I have your word on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s an Enforcement matter, it\u2019s an Enforcement matter.\u201d Irrespective of anything else, he still believed in the badge, in the good that they did.</p><p>Brecht gave a nod of acknowledgment. \u201cOver the past three months, Councilor Nikita Duncan\u2014\u201d</p><p>A Councilor?</p><p>Yeah, that got Max\u2019s attention.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>\u201c\u2014has lost three of her advisors by three very different methods. One was a heart attack, the second an automobile accident, the third an apparent suicide.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s gut went tight as cop instinct took over. \u201cCould be coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in coincidence, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as much as I believe in the tooth fairy.\u201d</p><p>The commander nodded. \u201cCouncilor Duncan does not believe in coincidences, either. She wants you to find out who is going after her people and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in San Francisco,\u201d Max said, the same instinct telling him that far more was going on beneath the surface than a simple\u2014and inexplicable\u2014request for a human cop on a Psy case. But Max didn\u2019t go straight for the jugular\u2014there were better ways of getting information. \u201cCops down there aren\u2019t going to like me stepping on their toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the purposes of this case, you\u2019ll be made a special investigator, with the authority to work across state lines. It\u2019s regular practice with detectives who have the specialized skills to work a particular situation.\u201d</p><p>That much was true. However, something else was equally true. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the Psy have their own version of a police force. I\u2019d have thought a Councilor\u201d\u2014especially a Councilor with all her secrets\u2014\u201cwould want them to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, yes.\u201d The commander picked up a small data crystal and placed it on the desk between them, a silent prick to the curiosity that made Max a cop who always, always found the answers. \u201cHowever, the Arrow Squad is loyal to another Councilor, and if that Councilor is behind these attacks, then Councilor Duncan will not get the truth. Her own people have proved deficient in the skills necessary to take care of the task.\u201d</p><p>Max thought over what he knew of Nikita Duncan. She was an astute businesswoman, one who made money hand over fist\u2014but unlike Councilors Ming LeBon and Kaleb Krychek, he\u2019d never heard her name linked with a military operation, so it might be a legitimate fact that she\u2019d found a gap in her resources once she eliminated this Arrow Squad from the mix.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he said, eyes narrowed. \u201cBut mental shield aside, there\u2019s got to be some other reason the Councilor asked for me. What skills make me so special?\u201d He was damn good at what he did, but there were excellent cops in San Francisco.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t disregard your shield so easily,\u201d the commander responded. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the strongest we\u2019ve ever encountered in a human.\u201d An implied confirmation that Psy had tried to break through it any number of times. \u201cHowever, you\u2019re correct. There is something else\u2014you have friends in the DarkRiver leopard pack. Councilor Duncan seems to believe that that friendship will make it easier for you to run the investigation in her city.\u201d</p><p>Ice crawled in a slow spread through Max\u2019s veins. Clay Bennett, the changeling male Max knew best, was one cool customer. Max wouldn\u2019t put it past the leopard pack to whittle down their enemy piece by piece\u2014they were predators after all. But\u2014\u201cIsn\u2019t Councilor Duncan\u2019s daughter mated to Lucas Hunter, the alpha of DarkRiver?\u201d Sascha Duncan\u2019s defection from the Psy world had made news across the country.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they no longer have any kind of a personal relationship.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded to show he\u2019d heard, but the fact of Sascha\u2019s existence, her relationship with Lucas, put his mind at ease. Because while they might be predators, the cats were also big on family. He couldn\u2019t see them culling Nikita\u2019s people on the sly. \u201cIf I do this,\u201d he said, knowing he couldn\u2019t let it go now, his curiosity a steel blue flame inside him, \u201cI\u2019m going to need full access. If Duncan has her people blocking me at every turn, it\u2019s going to be impossible for me to do my job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCouncilor Duncan understands that.\u201d Brecht picked up the data crystal and moved it in front of Max. \u201cThis has the basic background information. However, as you can imagine, there are areas of considerable sensitivity. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll be working with a Psy partner who\u2019ll help you in relation to the peculiarly Psy aspects of the investigation, and who will be tasked with filtering certain data.\u201d</p><p>Max had known he\u2019d need a Psy advisor, but the second part of Brecht\u2019s statement made his hand clench on the crystal. \u201cHow the fuck is he going to realize what\u2019s relevant and what\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe,\u201d the commander said, \u201cis to work intimately with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMakes no difference to the question\u2014what qualifications does this \u2018partner\u2019 of mine have to make those decisions?\u201d Max wasn\u2019t just used to working alone, he liked it that way.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a J,\u201d the commander said. \u201cHas been operative since she was sixteen. She\u2019s now twenty-eight.\u201d</p><p>Anticipation licked along his spine. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia Russo.\u201d</p><p>His mind reacted immediately\u2014an image of haunting eyes in a face marked by violence, a voice that said things it shouldn\u2019t, a body that made his own itch to thaw out all that ice. It was then, as he considered if the latter was even possible, that he was hit by the import of Brecht\u2019s words. \u201cTwelve years of active service? Most Js don\u2019t last that long.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d worked with at least twenty over his eleven years in Enforcement. Each had retired before the age of thirty, and, he realized, he\u2019d never seen any of them again. It hadn\u2019t struck him as odd before, because Psy weren\u2019t exactly the type to send Christmas cards, but the fact that not one, not one, had ended up working in another area of Justice\u2014either they had one hell of a retirement plan or . . . Given the cold-blooded way the Council treated its own people, the possibilities were chilling. And Sophia Russo had been a J for twelve years. She had to be reaching \u201cretirement\u201d age.</p><p>When the commander spoke, he didn\u2019t address Max\u2019s implied question, didn\u2019t tell him what happened to Js who reached the end of their working lives. \u201cMs. Russo has considerable experience in interacting with humans\u2014you should find her a satisfactory partner.\u201d A pause. \u201cDetective, I need an answer today.\u201d</p><p>Max played the data crystal over his fingers. He still wasn\u2019t sure what the hell he was doing considering working for the Psy, or the real reason why Nikita had asked for him, but if you stripped away all the bullshit, one thing remained unchanged\u2014he was a cop. And Nikita Duncan was a citizen. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sat across from the M-Psy in charge of her evaluation at the Pittsburgh branch of the Center, her hands placed on the table, her eyes calm.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been,\u201d the M-Psy said, \u201ca report of an incident at Liberty Penitentiary.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t fall for that trick, didn\u2019t respond. Because he hadn\u2019t asked a question.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have anything to do with that incident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the incident?\u201d</p><p>The M-Psy looked down at his notes. \u201cA pedophile mutilated himself.\u201d</p><p>It was easy to keep her face expressionless\u2014she\u2019d been practicing since she was eight years old and about to be euthanized. \u201cWas he human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he felt remorse,\u201d she suggested, knowing the creature in that cell had felt pity only for himself, for the fact that he\u2019d been caught and locked up. \u201cHumans have emotions after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no indication he felt remorse.\u201d</p><p>At least the man hadn\u2019t managed to fool the prison psychiatrists. \u201cIs he speaking?\u201d</p> <p>The M-Psy shook his head. \u201cNot coherently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s impossible to know if he felt remorse,\u201d she responded with total equanimity. Perhaps she should\u2019ve felt guilt, but of course, she was Silent. She felt nothing. But she knew what that prisoner had done, knew every tiny detail of the horror he\u2019d imprinted on a young, unformed psyche. Sophia had buried the memories even as she extracted them from the child\u2019s mind, leaving him with a week-long blank in his past that would only unlock when he was old enough and strong enough to bear it.</p><p>It was unfortunate that the trick didn\u2019t work on children who were born with the J facility. If it had, perhaps she would have had a different life . . . Perhaps.</p><p>The M-Psy tapped something on his datapad. \u201cThis is the third such incident in the past year where you\u2019ve been in close proximity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to be in prisons often,\u201d Sophia replied, though her mind was in another room in a well-appointed cabin two decades in the past. \u201cMy chances of being near an incident are higher than that of an ordinary individual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe J-Psy Management Board has determined that you need to go in for reconditioning\u201d\u2014the M-Psy turned his datapad so she could see the authorization\u2014\u201cespecially given your recent contact with Gerard Bonner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no disagreement with that.\u201d They\u2019d poke and prod at her during the reconditioning process, but Sophia knew what they\u2019d find. Nothing. Complete or partial memory erasure might not work on Js, but a woman who made her living retrieving the memories of others got very good at clouding her own when necessary. \u201cWould it be possible to schedule it today? I need to appear as an expert witness in a case first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Total reconditioning\u2014known as rehabilitation\u2014effectively turned the individual into a vegetable. But the basic reconditioning that Sophia had gone through any number of times took a bare few hours to complete. Add a full night\u2019s sleep and she\u2019d be functioning at peak efficiency again when the sun rose.</p><p>The M-Psy checked his schedule. \u201cWe can slot you in at six tonight.\u201d</p><p>And, Sophia thought, she\u2019d lose several hours to a semi-conscious state\u2014when time was running out for her at an inexorable pace. But all she said was, \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is another matter.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked up at the comment. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Management Board has reassigned you.\u201d The M-Psy sent an electronic file through to Sophia\u2019s organizer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been selected to work directly for Councilor Nikita Duncan as a special advisor.\u201d</p><p>The first step, Sophia thought, having expected the transfer on some level. Js who began to show too many cracks were phased out step-by-step. By the time they disappeared, nobody remembered they\u2019d once known a Justice Psy by that name. Nobody realized the J had simply vanished, never to be seen again. \u201cMy duties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouncilor Duncan will brief you\u2014you have an appointment with her at one tomorrow. Given the time of your court appearance, you should have no difficulty making your flight.\u201d The M-Psy stood. Paused. \u201cI haven\u2019t been authorized to inform you of this, but you should have time to put your affairs in order.\u201d</p><p>Sophia waited. The words were unusual, could well be another trap.</p><p>But when he spoke, he gave her the answer to a question that had been circling in her mind for months now. \u201cThis reconditioning will be your last\u2014your telepathic shields are too severely degraded to allow for a further reset.\u201d Cool green eyes met hers. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The next time she walked into a Center, only a shambling, empty-eyed shell would walk back out.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>The child has been damaged on a fundamental level. Any attempt to save her will require the allocation of considerable time and resources with no guarantee of a productive return.</p><p>\u2014PsyMed report on Sophia Russo, minor, age 8</p><p>Just over twenty-four hours after his conversation with Commander Brecht, Max exited his gate at San Francisco\u2019s domestic terminal with a single suitcase and one very pissed-off cat in an industrial-strength carrier. A cat whose yowling was starting to make people look at Max with the narrow-eyed stare reserved for those who beat their dogs and ran their horses to exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cMax!\u201d</p><p>Looking up, he saw a familiar tawny-haired figure. Putting the suitcase and carrier down, he picked Talin up in his arms and gave her a kiss on the lips. \u201cDamn, you look good, Tally.\u201d Her face glowed with health, her freckles golden against skin that had managed to retain the burnished hue of summer even in the crisp chill of January.</p><p>A growl emerged from the green-eyed man on Tally\u2019s right, his gaze vivid against rich, dark skin. \u201cOnce, I\u2019ll allow. Kiss her again and all you\u2019ll be kissing is the asphalt.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Max put a laughing Talin on her feet and held out his hand. \u201cNice to see you, too.\u201d</p><p>Clay shook it. \u201cHello, Cop.\u201d His eyes went to Max\u2019s feet.</p><p>And Max realized Morpheus had gone utterly silent the instant they neared the couple. Glancing down, Max saw the black-haired ball of indignant fur staring at Clay. \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to figure out what the hell kind of cat you are.\u201d</p><p>Talin bent, went to reach through the bars as if to pet the cat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Max warned, one hand on her shoulder. \u201cHe bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe bites Tally,\u201d Clay said, looking at the cat with eyes that were no longer human, \u201cI\u2019ll show him my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, now,\u201d Talin said, stroking Morpheus gently on the forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s just mad about being cooped up, aren\u2019t you, gorgeous?\u201d Looking up at Max, she mock-whispered, \u201cClay gets snarly on flights, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it,\u201d Clay said, but the curve of his lips made Max grin. Man was well and truly a goner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you brought him,\u201d Talin said, rising to her feet. \u201cHe\u2019d have missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah\u2014he\u2019d have found another sucker to feed him,\u201d Max said, knowing the former alley cat had the survival instincts of a rat on a sinking ship. \u201cBut since I\u2019m not sure how long this\u2019ll take, I figured Morpheus might as well come and see the world with me.\u201d Nodding thanks at Clay as the changeling male grabbed his suitcase, Max took the carrier. \u201cI appreciate the pickup.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI voted to leave you stranded,\u201d Clay muttered.</p><p>Talin linked her arm with Max\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him. Secretly, he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery secretly.\u201d Max\u2019s heart went tight in a good way at seeing Talin so happy. They\u2019d become close during the investigation into several missing kids a while back, but he\u2019d known her on and off for years, their beats colliding in New York. She\u2019d worked with troubled kids\u2014and Enforcement was always picking up those kids.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t just that. He and Talin had a connection, one they\u2019d never really articulated but which was simply understood. They\u2019d both been children caught in the foster-care system, understood the scars that could leave. It wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you could really explain to anyone who hadn\u2019t lived through it.</p><p>But Clay got it. Max didn\u2019t know the big man\u2019s history, but the connection Max shared with Talin was slowly being formed with her mate as well. Max had taken them to dinner the last time they\u2019d come up to Manhattan, had ended up getting well and truly drunk with the leopard. Talin had herded them home from the bar, promising to tear the hides off them the entire time, but she\u2019d tucked them both in that night\u2014pushing Max down onto their hotel couch and telling him to stay put.</p><p>Grinning at the memory of the pulsating rock music she\u2019d played the next morning as punishment, he looked down at the wild mane of her hair. \u201cDid you check out the apartment?\u201d He\u2019d e-mailed them the details of the place where he\u2019d been put up for the duration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s near Fisherman\u2019s Wharf,\u201d Talin said, \u201cnot that far from the Duncan building. Nice area\u2014close to the shops.\u201d</p><p>Clay glanced up as he stowed Max\u2019s bag in the trunk of the car. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to tell us what you\u2019re doing for Sascha\u2019s mother?\u201d His eyes were human again\u2014and full of a keen intelligence, as befitted one of Dark-River\u2019s top men.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t say anything. Not yet.\u201d Max put Morpheus in the backseat. \u201cI might be able to share more once I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Getting into the seat beside the still silent cat, he strapped up and waited for Clay and Talin to get in. Except . . . \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Reaching beneath his thigh, he found himself holding some sort of a weird pink-haired doll with joints in impossible places.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a Metamorph,\u201d Talin told him, turning to look over her shoulder. \u201cThey change into animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d He played with the little toy, managed to figure out the mechanism, and voila, he had an improbably pink wolf on his hands. \u201cLike a changeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Clay keeps buying them for Noor even though she already has at least a dozen.\u201d Talin was twining her fingers with her mate\u2019s free hand even as she teased him. \u201cOne look from those big brown eyes and he folds.\u201d</p><p>Clay lifted up her hand and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. \u201cYou don\u2019t complain when I melt for your big gray eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClay.\u201d Blushing, Talin nonetheless blew her mate a kiss.</p> <p>Relaxed by the byplay, Max leaned back in his seat\u2014after checking to ensure a still silent Morpheus was okay\u2014and thought about the e-mail he\u2019d received while waiting to board the airjet. It had come via the commander\u2019s office.</p><p>Sophia Russo will meet you in San Francisco.</p><p>Anticipation thrummed through him\u2014his body didn\u2019t seem to want to accept the fact that the woman was more likely to freeze his balls off in the night than consent to tangle with him in the male/female sense.</p><p>But Max had stopped being ruled by his hormones around the age of sixteen, no matter that this J with her night-violet eyes full of secrets tugged at him in the most visceral of ways. Using the time he had before his flight boarded, he\u2019d made a few phone calls, including one to Bart Reuben to get an update on Bonner. The prosecutor had had nothing new to report on that front, but when Max mentioned he was going to be working with Sophia, he\u2019d said, \u201cI got curious about her, did some digging.\u201d</p><p>Max had been startled by a sudden\u2014and forceful\u2014surge of possessiveness. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose gloves,\u201d Bart had replied. \u201cI realized I\u2019d seen them before, on a J I worked with a long time ago. I know they mean something, but I haven\u2019t figured out what yet. However, I did find out something else very interesting.\u201d</p><p>Fighting off his unexpectedly strong response to the idea of Bart investigating Sophia, Max had forced his tone to lighten. \u201cYou going to make me beat it out of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a bottle of single malt whiskey will do.\u201d He\u2019d been able to hear the laugh in his friend\u2019s voice. \u201cSeems like over the past year, our Ms. Russo has developed a curious little habit of being in close proximity to some very nasty people who decided to mutilate themselves in creative ways.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not surprising, given how long she\u2019s been a J.\u201d A cop would have to be willfully blind to miss that occasionally homicidal \u201cquirk\u201d of J psychology. It was always impossible to prove anything, of course, even if a cop felt so inclined given the nature of the individuals the Js invariably targeted, but the Corps policed itself very effectively\u2014it wasn\u2019t good for their image to have their people start going nuts in public.</p><p>Even as the thought passed through his head, Max had found himself disturbed by the idea that Sophia Russo might be going slowly insane. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t she been yanked from active duty?\u201d It had come out harsher than it should have.</p><p>Bart, thankfully, hadn\u2019t noticed. \u201cShe\u2019s very, very good at her job,\u201d he\u2019d replied. \u201cBut she\u2019s reaching her use-by-date. One of these days, she\u2019s going to disappear just like every other J I\u2019ve worked with over the years.\u201d</p><p>Now, as the car entered the hilly streets of San Francisco proper, Max thought of the last words Sophia had spoken to him, and he felt a low burn of anger in his gut at the idea of her having a \u201cuse-by-date.\u201d</p><p>Sophia took a seat across from the exotic-looking woman who might well sign the order for her rehabilitation once she was deemed obsolete. It should have concerned her, if only on an intellectual level, but Sophia wasn\u2019t affected by much at present.</p><p>So soon after a reconditioning, with her mind piercing in its clarity, the facts were undeniable: her shields against the PsyNet were rock solid\u2014for the simple reason that all Js were drilled remorselessly until they mastered that skill\u2014but the shields that protected her on a day-to-day basis, her telepathic protections, were paper-thin. Any number of occurrences could incite a devastating mental wave.</p><p>Results could range from shock and psychic disintegration to death.</p><p>Councilor Nikita Duncan raised her head from the file on her desk as Sophia was thinking she\u2019d prefer a sudden and total death over a psychic collapse. Far better that it all end in a sudden, bright burst of agony, than to find herself weakened and at the mercy of those who had none. She\u2019d been helpless once in her life\u2014never again would she allow herself to be in that position.</p><p>\u201cMs. Russo\u201d\u2014Councilor Duncan\u2019s voice was precise\u2014\u201cI believe you had a court appearance this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was at nine,\u201d Sophia said without pause. \u201cI was finished and on my way here by ten thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve had a chance to read the file I e-mailed to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I went through it on the airjet.\u201d What she didn\u2019t add was that she\u2019d spent the majority of the time looking at the small digital image of the man she\u2019d be working with, a man she\u2019d never expected to see again in the course of what remained of her lifetime.</p><p>The photo had been taken earlier this year, and there\u2019d been something in it that said he\u2019d been laughing just before the photographer pressed the shutter, those uptilted eyes lit from within. She\u2019d found herself fascinated by the difference between that image and the grim-faced man she\u2019d met outside the interrogation room in Wyoming.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d Nikita asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at this stage\u2014the assignment appears straightforward.\u201d Other than the fact that she\u2019d been paired with a human who made her think thoughts that weren\u2019t only impossible, but so outrageously impossible that she wondered if she was already walking the cracked and twisted road to irrevocable insanity.</p><p>Nikita\u2019s eyes turned into pieces of jet, hard, cutting. \u201cBefore we continue, I want to make one thing explicit\u2014I don\u2019t want any \u2018incidents\u2019 while you\u2019re in my employ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to, Councilor.\u201d Sophia kept her face expressionless\u2014it was a fiction, but it was a fiction that would keep her alive a little longer. Long enough to speak to Max Shannon again, to find out what it was about him that made the last forgotten slivers of her soul, her personality, shimmer with unexpected fragments of light. At the same time, the otherness whispered that he was smart, that he\u2019d discover everything about her and turn away once he knew. It would hurt. And the broken girl inside of her, the secret hidden beyond Silence, was tired, so tired of hurting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said what I have to say,\u201d Nikita said after a small pause. \u201cBreak the rules and you\u2019ll pay the price.\u201d</p><p>Sophia knew enough of Nikita to understand that that was no idle threat. The Councilor was rumored to be a viral transmitter, able to infect minds with the most fatal\u2014and if she chose, viciously painful\u2014of psychic weapons. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d Rising to her feet, she picked up her organizer. \u201cI do have one question that doesn\u2019t relate directly to the case.\u201d</p><p>Nikita waited.</p><p>\u201cAccording to my immediate supervisor, you specifically requested me.\u201d Sophia hadn\u2019t been aware that Nikita even knew her name. \u201cWas there a reason for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt made more sense to use you than to take a fully functioning J out of the system.\u201d Cool, pragmatic words.</p><p>Except for one thing.</p><p>Sophia knew Nikita was lying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max\u2019s mind had circled back to Bonner by the time they arrived at the apartment\u2014having stopped to pick up a few supplies on the way. Forcing himself off the topic, if only to deny the bastard the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d once again got everyone dancing to his tune, he looked around the apartment while Talin played with a Morpheus who was still miffed at his recent imprisonment. But judicious use of cat treats and Talin\u2019s stroking hands seemed to be bringing the sulking beast out of it.</p><p>\u201cNicer place than I expected,\u201d he said to Clay. Big bedroom, living area, kitchen, and bath. And he had windows. \u201cGuess being a special investigator pays more than being a detective.\u201d</p><p>Clay walked to join Max at the window near the dining alcove. \u201cGood view from here. We\u2019ve had a lot of heavy fog in the mornings, but it makes for some spectacular sun-rises.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lowering his voice, Max asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Jon?\u201d The teenager had been kidnapped, held in a Psy lab, and tortured before being rescued. Last Max had heard, he was giving Talin and Clay fits with his tricks.</p><p>Clay grinned. \u201cStill a smartass teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s got a crush on one of the young dominant females\u2014poor cub. He doesn\u2019t realize how nice she\u2019s being to him by not kicking his ass.\u201d</p><p>Max grinned, relief a crushing wave inside him. \u201cI bet she thinks he\u2019s adorable.\u201d</p> <p>Clay snorted. \u201cI think it\u2019s more a case of \u2018aw damn, he\u2019s a baby, I can\u2019t hurt him.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Max winced, feeling for the kid. \u201cThat\u2019s got to bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d A very feline look appeared on Clay\u2019s face. \u201cBut, you know, he\u2019s determined as hell. A few years down the track and who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>Glancing around at Talin\u2019s voice, he saw Morpheus purring in her lap. Ungrateful alley cat never purred for Max. All he got was sniffs and snarls. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take him home with us?\u201d Worry marked her expressive features. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like an inside cat.\u201d</p> <p>Max scowled on Morpheus\u2019s behalf. \u201cDamn right he\u2019s not. He\u2019ll find a way out of here within the day.\u201d And probably come home with a few new scars to add to his already prodigious collection.</p><p>Talin scratched the traitorous cat behind his ears. Morpheus\u2019s eyes all but rolled into the back of his head. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, sounding dubious of Max\u2019s claim, \u201cif he starts to pine for some greenery, you know where I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorpheus\u2019s favorite hobby involves garbage cans\u2014I think he\u2019d have an aneurysm in a forest,\u201d Max muttered. \u201cIs he really purring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is. I know how to treat cats.\u201d A sultry glance aimed solely at her mate.</p><p>Max rocked back on his heels, feeling like a voyeur and\u2014if he was honest\u2014a little bit envious as well. He\u2019d give his right arm to be loved like that . . . to love like that. But fact was, he wasn\u2019t capable of that depth of vulnerability, and he was honest enough to know it, to never make promises he couldn\u2019t keep.</p><p>One woman had kissed him on the cheek as they parted and said, \u201cYou threw away the key to your heart a long time ago, didn\u2019t you, Max?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d smiled that night, because she was a woman he respected, a woman who remained a good friend, but afterward, he\u2019d wondered\u2014had he thrown it away or had the lock become permanently warped, incapable of opening?</p><p>The discreet chime of the doorbell silvered into the air, into his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d Walking across, he opened the door.</p> <p>And knew he\u2019d been waiting for her since the second he set foot in this city of fog beside a sparkling bay.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>Any skin-to-skin contact with a human or changeling, even a Psy with inadequate shields, may destroy what remains of your telepathic protections. Avoid all physical contact.</p><p>\u2014Advisory letter to Sophia Russo from the</p><p>J Corps Medical Division</p><p>Sophia was unprepared for the visual impact of Max Shannon, no matter that she\u2019d met him previously. He was the kind of man some women would want to own, she thought, having run across such females in the course of her career several times. They would see him as a trophy, a prize to show off\u2014never realizing that they were attempting to leash a vicious storm.</p><p>Though Max was beautiful, what saved him from crossing the line into a more delicate prettiness was the obdurate hardness of his jawline, the unflinchingly adult expression in his gaze. Those eyes said that Max Shannon had looked into the void\u2014and come away with a piece of it in his soul.</p><p>Then he spoke, drawing her attention to those well-shaped lips. \u201cSophia.\u201d He\u2019d braced one hand on the doorjamb, didn\u2019t pull it down to offer to her.</p><p>She appreciated the gesture\u2014many humans took it as an insult when she refused to shake their hands, never realizing that the common courtesy could cost her everything. \u201cI thought I should let you know I\u2019d arrived. I\u2019ve been placed in the apartment next door.\u201d</p><p>Max glanced to his right. \u201cThat\u2019ll make things easier.\u201d Easy words, but his tone said something else.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be spying on you, Mr. Shannon.\u201d Something long dormant in her stirred at the challenge she read in him. \u201cTo be quite frank, your personal activities hold no interest for either me or Councilor Duncan.\u201d Not quite the truth. Nikita might not care about Max Shannon\u2019s personal life, but Sophia found herself compelled to know the man behind the enigmatic mask of an Enforcement detective.</p><p>The edge of a smile touched Max\u2019s lips, but it was his eyes that mattered. They never lost that blade-sharp gleam that told her he was calculating her every move, her every act. \u201cYou just want me for my detecting skills, is that it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to respond to the patently nonserious question\u2014she\u2019d been dealing with humans her entire adult life, but she\u2019d never dealt with someone who evoked this odd . . . fascination in her. It had begun with the way he looked at her but was now a wholly independent thing. And the fact that it was already so strong so soon after a reconditioning, meant she had far less time than she\u2019d previously believed before her telepathic shields sheared forever.</p><p>Someone spoke behind Max at that moment, and he turned, dropping his arm from the doorjamb. That was when Sophia saw the two other individuals in the room. A human female and a male who was clearly not human. She took a step back and to her left as the couple exited to stand to her right.</p><p>\u201cClay, Talin, this is my . . . partner\u201d\u2014a pause she knew had been intentional\u2014\u201cSophia Russo.\u201d</p><p>The man gave a nod, while the woman smiled. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded in response, wondering how this Talin could stand with such calm beside the male who was unquestionably a predator. And since this was San Francisco there were only two possible conclusions\u2014only one once you factored in the way the green-eyed man had moved, with a fluidity at odds with the muscular size of him. \u201cYou\u2019re members of DarkRiver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be new to the city,\u201d Talin said, tucking back her hair to reveal an ear adorned with a dangling earring made of irregular glass beads in the colors of autumn. \u201cMost people recognize Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to San Francisco before,\u201d Sophia replied, intrigued by the odd shapes of the beads, the way they\u2019d been put together. There was no conformity, no perfection. \u201cHowever, I deal almost exclusively with humans and Psy.\u201d Changelings had authority over all crimes that involved just those of their race.</p><p>\u201cSophia\u2019s a J,\u201d Max said, leaning one shoulder against the doorjamb.</p><p>She noted the corded forearms revealed by the rolled-up sleeves of his vivid blue shirt, noted, too, the easy grace with which he made even the smallest of movements\u2014this man, she thought, was built along the sleek lines of the low-slung cars preferred by so many of the emotional races.</p><p>Her gaze clashed with his at that moment, and the question in them made her aware they were all waiting for something from her. Breaking the contact\u2014which felt oddly, inexplicably intimate\u2014she took a step to her left. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your visit. Detective Shannon, if you\u2019d just let me know when you\u2019re ready to start\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can start now,\u201d he interrupted, still in that lazy position against the doorjamb. If she hadn\u2019t seen him in Wyoming, she might have been fooled into believing him \u201csafe.\u201d But she had seen him in that prison. Not only that, she\u2019d read the file that chronicled his stubborn, relentless pursuit of the Butcher of Park Avenue. She knew the danger that lay beneath the languid charm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you to it, then.\u201d The woman named Talin stepped forward to kiss Max on the cheek, breaking Sophia\u2019s line of sight. \u201cBut I was hoping you\u2019d have dinner with us,\u201d she said, turning to include Sophia in the invitation.</p><p>Max glanced at his watch even as Sophia curled the fingers of her left hand into her palm. What Talin had just done, that easy contact . . . it had been ordinary. Human. And it had made Sophia brutally aware of the gulf between her and this cop whose presence, whose watchful eyes, fanned the fires of rebellion in her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost three now,\u201d Max said, his voice low and smooth\u2014and disturbingly abrasive against Sophia\u2019s skin, \u201cso how about dinner around seven? We should be ready for a break by then anyway.\u201d A glance up at Sophia from those eyes that saw far too much. \u201cThat work for you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she said, \u201cYes, that\u2019ll be fine,\u201d when she should have demurred from the social invitation. As her response to Max demonstrated with manifest clarity, she\u2019d failed in her attempts to be the most perfect of Psy. But she was in no way similar to a human. She was, in all probability, even less \u201chuman\u201d than most of her brethren, her psyche having been worn away by the corrosive acid of the images stored in her brain.</p><p>Clay said good-bye then, his voice deep against Talin\u2019s softer tone. As the couple left, the leopard male\u2019s hand on his mate\u2019s lower back, Sophia found herself the sole focus of Max\u2019s perceptive near-black eyes, the eyes of a man who was used to stripping shields, unearthing the most deeply buried of truths. \u201cCome on in,\u201d he said, \u201cunless you need to grab anything from your place? We should go over the details, make sure we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll retrieve my organizer.\u201d The words came out calm, though her heartbeat had turned erratic. \u201cIt\u2019ll take me only a minute or two.\u201d Stepping to her door, she pushed through and picked up the small case she\u2019d left on the coffee table. She should\u2019ve walked straight back out, but she took a minute to breathe, to check her PsyNet shields for any minor fractures that might betray the swiftness with which her recent reconditioning had begun to degrade.</p><p>Satisfied that everything was holding for now and certain, too, that her secrets were safe from a cop who saw too much, she went to Max\u2019s. His living area was empty. Assuming he\u2019d gone to retrieve his own notes, she closed the door and took a seat at the small table in the dining alcove near the window.</p><p>She\u2019d just opened her case when a huge black cat jumped onto the chair opposite, placed its front paws on the table, and looked at her with one gray and one brown eye. Physically startled, she nonetheless contained her reaction\u2014that aspect of her conditioning was so much a part of her, it no longer took much effort to maintain.</p> <p>The cat continued to stare at her.</p><p>Curious as to what the creature would do if touched, she extended a hand and brought her fingers to its nose. It sniffed at the leather-synth of her glove before proceeding to stare at her again.</p><p>\u201cIgnore Morpheus.\u201d Max walked back into the room and picked up the cat to drop him easily to the floor. The feline padded off, tail in the air. \u201cHe likes to stare people out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She found herself following Max\u2019s movements as he put some cat food and water into a split feeding dish. He\u2019d changed into jeans and a black T-shirt that bared his arms, the color an austere contrast to the golden warmth of his skin tone. \u201cHave you had any further contact from Bonner?\u201d</p><p>Sleek black hair fell across his forehead as he shook his head and rose. \u201cNo.\u201d A single harsh word. \u201cBastard\u2019s probably waiting for us to crawl back to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll wait a long time.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise he said, \u201cIf I thought he\u2019d tell us the locations of the bodies if I crawled, I\u2019d do it without hesitation.\u201d</p><p>The answer added another layer of complexity to his personality, made the fascination inside her grow. \u201cMost males, especially those drawn to a career in Enforcement, would consider that an insult to their pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride is meaningless if you can\u2019t keep your promises.\u201d Washing his hands after making that cryptic statement, he wiped them on a towel and came to take a seat opposite her. \u201cFirst things first\u201d\u2014all cop, not even a trace of the deceptive charm she\u2019d seen in the doorway\u2014\u201chere\u2019s what I know.\u201d He recapped the situation. \u201cDo you have any more information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201d She made herself concentrate on the screen of her organizer. \u201cAs far as I can tell from your summation, we were given identical files.\u201d Except that hers had included an image of Max Shannon, an image she\u2019d saved to an encrypted file.</p><p>Max leaned back in his seat, waiting to speak until she\u2019d lifted her eyes to him. \u201cHave you been to any of the scenes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Kenneth Vale\u2019s\u2014the apparent suicide\u2019s\u2014apartment has been compromised to the point where it\u2019s useless as far as any forensic examination is concerned,\u201d she told him, having checked that with Councilor Duncan. \u201cHowever, it was left intact to give Council psychologists a chance to examine it in case it threw any light on Vale\u2019s personality. His suicide is considered an unusual case.\u201d</p><p>Max narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou talking about the method he used to hang himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sophia couldn\u2019t imagine the demons that would drive a man to choose such a long, tortuous form of death\u2014if indeed, he had chosen his death. \u201cI\u2019ve been given the codes to access his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, we\u2019ll go have a look. I\u2019m guessing we\u2019ve got nothing on the heart attack victim\u2014file says he was cremated,\u201d Max said, tipping back his chair.</p><p>\u201cThey would have taken samples of his blood, checked for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI e-mailed Nikita from New York,\u201d Max interrupted, \u201casked her about that. Seems like the samples have mysteriously disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d He tapped his finger against the table, and it wasn\u2019t a restless movement. \u201cWhat about the car the third possible victim was driving when she had her accident?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s being held at a private facility here in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something at least.\u201d Scowling, he tipped his chair even farther back. \u201cWould\u2019ve been better if Nikita had called us in right away instead of waiting several weeks after the crash\u2014but I guess she figured she could get to the bottom of it herself.\u201d</p><p>Sophia couldn\u2019t concentrate on his words, her attention held by something else altogether. \u201cYou\u2019ll fall over if you keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>He shot her an amused look, continuing to hold the precarious balance. \u201cUsed to drive my foster families nuts.\u201d</p><p>His openness about being in the foster-care system was unexpected. And it made Sophia give in to the seeds of rebellion, to ask a question that a perfect Psy would have never asked. \u201cYou weren\u2019t with one family long term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Longest was six months,\u201d he said easily, and tipped his chair back down on all four feet. \u201cI assume Nikita had her techs check the vehicle out?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a strange realization taking form inside of her. Max hadn\u2019t had parents either, not in reality. He was like her, at least in that way. She wanted to share that with him, with this man who\u2019d seemed to see her from their very first meeting, but she didn\u2019t know how, having no capacity or experience at building bonds with another individual. \u201cYes,\u201d she said instead, harshly aware of how remote she sounded, how inhuman . . . as if she was already dead. \u201cHowever, Councilor Duncan has authorized the expenditure required to get an independent report if you think it necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll decide that after I have a chat with the mechanic.\u201d Pushing back his chair, he rose to his feet, the scent of his body\u2014soap, warmth, something darker\u2014sweeping across her senses. \u201cBut first\u2014Vale\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d She stood, aware her movements were not as graceful as his\u2014her body felt jerky, disconnected. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me a moment to change out of my suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had court this morning?\u201d He reached out to open the door for her, the action making her pause for a second. Men never did things like that for her. It wasn\u2019t because she was Psy\u2014she\u2019d watched any number of males do the same act automatically for all females. But they always seemed to want to distance themselves from the violence she wore on her face\u2014as if they were afraid it was catching.</p><p>\u201cSophia?\u201d</p><p>She realized she\u2019d been quiet too long. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did the case go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow it always does,\u201d she said, unlocking her door with gloved hands that were a constant reminder of who she was, and who she\u2019d be till the day she died\u2014no matter the need to rebel, to break the chains of a past that refused to set her free, there could be no other tomorrow for her. \u201cI told the judge and jury what I saw. That is all I do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>Men who know their fathers are different creatures from men who don\u2019t. It\u2019s time I ripped off that particular blindfold.</p><p>\u2014E-mail from Max Shannon to Bartholomew Reuben</p><p>Max watched Sophia disappear into her apartment and let out a breath he hadn\u2019t been aware of holding. The woman got to him, no doubt about it. And she got to him in a way that made a mockery of any thoughts he might\u2019ve had about keeping his emotional distance.</p><p>Heading back to his bedroom with that truth circling in his head, he grabbed a black Windbreaker from his suitcase. It took only a couple of seconds to shove his cell phone inside and shrug into it\u2014walking back out, he leaned against the wall opposite Sophia\u2019s door as he waited for her to finish changing. It gave him a couple of very needed minutes to calm down.</p><p>And face the facts.</p><p>His body not only liked the idea of Sophia Russo, it liked the reality of her even more. She had lush, sensual lips, curves that made a man thank God\u2014and she smelled so good he wanted to bury his face in her neck like the leopards did with their mates. But those eyes that had once reminded him of River\u2019s laughing gaze . . . they were utterly flat, so lifeless he may as well have been talking to an automaton.</p><p>With most Psy, he would\u2019ve accepted that lack as an inevitable side effect of their emotionless personalities, but with Sophia, he knew it had to be a carefully constructed lie. Because no one who\u2019d seen the things Sophia Russo had seen, who\u2019d walked in the blood-soaked footsteps of evil, could have remained unscathed by it.</p><p>Not unless her emotions weren\u2019t simply buried, but excised from existence.</p><p>The door opened at that moment, revealing the woman at the center of his thoughts. She\u2019d changed into jeans and a gray sweatshirt that covered those curves he was starting to obsess over. He could see the edge of a white T-shirt beneath the sweatshirt, while plain black sneakers peeked out from under the hem of her jeans.</p><p>\u201cIs this appropriate?\u201d she asked. \u201cI assumed we might have time to go to the garage as well.\u201d</p><p>He ran his gaze not over her clothing, but over the soft curls of her shoulder-length hair. A rich, charcoal black, those curls tempted a man to fist his hands in the softness, tug her close, and sink his teeth\u2014deliciously carefully\u2014into that full lower lip. \u201cYes.\u201d It came out husky.</p><p>She hesitated, as if she\u2019d caught the edge in his tone, but her words when they came were pragmatic. \u201cI\u2019ll e-mail the Councilor from the car, ensure the chief mechanic knows we\u2019ll be coming.\u201d Locking her door after picking up that little computronic gadget that seemed to be surgically attached to her hand, she fell into step beside him, her head not even reaching his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re short.\u201d He could tuck her under his arm, and against his body, without any problem whatsoever.</p><p>Sophia almost halted. \u201cThat kind of observation is rude in all cultures.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, but he\u2019d noted the jerky movement before she smoothed out her stride, considered the implications\u2014Psy made it a point to react as little as possible, regardless of the provocation. And Max was very, very good at provocation when he was in the mood. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you didn\u2019t look good short.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am what is termed a \u2018throwback\u2019 to my great-great-grandmother,\u201d Sophia said, her tone pure feminine frost. \u201cShe had the identical body type. I will never be slender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where I\u2019m standing\u201d\u2014Max couldn\u2019t help himself, the devil in him taking over\u2014\u201cslender is overrated.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him with a focus that made his lips curve into a slow, satisfied smile, Sophia pressed her finger to the touch pad for the elevator. \u201cWill your pet be alright in the apartment?\u201d</p><p>Surprised she\u2019d bothered to ask after Morpheus, he nodded. \u201cI left a window open for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is only a very narrow ledge, and it\u2019s several floors off the ground.\u201d A glance back down the corridor, as if she was considering returning for Morpheus. \u201cHe is also in an unfamiliar city.\u201d</p> <p>That look, the words, the hint of a personality behind the ice, had every one of his instincts humming\u2014Sophia Russo was no robotic Psy. She was something, someone far more intriguing. \u201cMorpheus is an alley cat,\u201d he said, remembering the way he\u2019d seen her extend her fingers toward the cat, the inquisitive look on her face when she\u2019d thought he wasn\u2019t watching. \u201cHe already considers that ledge his own personal egress and the city his very own playground, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is your pet and your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Letting her step into the elevator as it arrived, he bit back a grin at that prim reminder and reached for the keypad. \u201cI was told we\u2019d have a vehicle\u2014do you know if it\u2019s already here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I picked it up and parked it in the basement garage.\u201d She waited until he\u2019d pressed his finger to the appropriate number before surprising the hell out of him. \u201cYou can drive.\u201d</p><p>When he raised an eyebrow, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough contact with human males to realize you seem to have a congenital inability to function while a female is at the wheel, and I\u2019d rather your full attention be on the case.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels, way past intrigued and well into seriously screwed\u2014because there was only one way this could end. That hint of personality and the inexorable tug of a deeper something between them notwithstanding, Sophia wasn\u2019t only a J, wasn\u2019t only a Psy, she was Councilor Duncan\u2019s personal eyes and ears. A smart man would keep his distance, make sure she never forgot that while they might be working together, they sure as hell weren\u2019t on the same team.</p> <p>There was just one problem with that\u2014he, a man known for leaving his lovers with smiles on their faces, and without a backward look, wanted to know every tiny detail about this woman who spoke to parts of him that had been in cold storage so long, his body physically hurt as they woke. It was, to be honest, uncomfortable as hell. More, the shocking intensity of his response went against the pragmatic nature of his mind\u2014he was used to thinking, to planning.</p><p>But he was also a man who knew how to adapt. And he hadn\u2019t backed down from anything or anyone since the day he\u2019d grown old enough, and strong enough, to defend himself . . . to protect himself.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said as the elevator doors opened, determined to uncover the truth of the enigma that was Sophia Russo, \u201cchangelings would consider your letting me drive a surrender.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out into the garage, so prim and proper that he wanted to mess her up three ways to Sunday, the long-forgotten boy in him sitting up in mischievous anticipation. What would she do, he wondered? Did Sophia Russo even understand the meaning of the word \u201cplay\u201d?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you realize,\u201d Sophia said in response to his comment, \u201cthat nothing is that easy with Psy, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d He wanted to hear her say his name, acknowledge him as a man.</p><p>A slight nod. \u201cThis is our car.\u201d She stopped in front of a black sedan with tinted windows.</p><p>He whistled through his teeth. \u201cThis is a very well-designed tank.\u201d Sleek, meant to mix into ordinary traffic, but\u2014to his experienced eyes\u2014surely bulletproof and with a body built to survive impacts from vehicles twice its size.</p> <p>\u201cCouncilor Duncan thought it prudent since I\u2019ll be working with you.\u201d A curl of raven black hair swung against her cheek as she began to slide off her right glove. \u201cIt\u2019s become common knowledge that once a J takes an \u2018impression\u2019 of a memory, that memory becomes inaccessible to another J.\u201d</p><p>Realization coalesced into a tight line of tension across his shoulders. \u201cHow many times has someone tried to kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain.\u201d She used her thumbprint\u2014her hand unmarked, unscarred\u2014to unlock the car and access the computronic control panel. \u201cI can program you in now if you\u2019ll come over and press your thumb to the scanner.\u201d</p><p>He did so, waiting patiently while she ensured he had full rights to operate the vehicle. \u201cGuess,\u201d he said afterward, as she got out and walked around to the passenger side door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an estimate of how many times you may have been the target of an assassination attempt.\u201d</p><p>She opened her door. \u201cI\u2019ve only been shot at three times.\u201d</p><p>Only. A lot of cops didn\u2019t get shot at that many times their whole career. Sliding into the driver\u2019s seat\u2014after shifting it back more than a foot\u2014he brought up the manual controls, viscerally aware of the delicate vulnerability of her skin bare inches away. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d he asked, speaking past a sudden possessive edge that honed his protectiveness to a steely gleam.</p><p>And that, too, was a surprise. Though he was a protector at heart, a facet of his personality he\u2019d learned to handle, he\u2019d never been possessive . . . or maybe, a long silent part of him whispered, he\u2019d simply learned not to be. If you didn\u2019t claim people, they couldn\u2019t reject you, couldn\u2019t leave you, couldn\u2019t break your fucking heart. Except even that reality didn\u2019t stop his primal response to Sophia\u2014it came from some place deeper, beyond the civilized skin of his humanity.</p><p>Sophia turned to buckle her safety belt. \u201cI assume,\u201d she said in response to his question, \u201cpeople wanted to stop me from giving evidence\u2014if I die, the impression dies with me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers almost brushed her hair as he braced his arm on the passenger side seatback in preparation for reversing the car.</p><p>The way she shifted to avoid any contact was subtle . . . and a chilling reminder that for all her lush femininity, Sophia Russo would never melt for any man. It should\u2019ve thrown cold water on his simmering hunger, nipped that dawning possessiveness in the bud, but all it did was make him want to tug at her curls, just to see what she\u2019d do.</p><p>There was a reason he\u2019d spent most of junior high in detention.</p><p>Fighting the urge, he dropped his arm once he had the car out and angled toward the exit. Slow, he thought, he had to do this slow. She was so skittish, he\u2019d have to stroke her into trusting him. If he pushed too hard, too soon, he\u2019d lose any hope of getting through her shields\u2014and that was unacceptable.</p><p>Because Max had made his decision. Whatever it was that burned between him and this J with her haunted eyes and secrets, he wasn\u2019t about walk away. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, making his voice deliberately relaxed, nonthreatening, \u201cI meant why can\u2019t another J re-scan a memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not certain.\u201d Sophia\u2019s voice was steady, but with a husky undertone that brushed a kiss across his skin. \u201cHowever, the strongest theory is that whatever mental \u2018door\u2019 we enter to take the memory has the flow-on effect of permanently closing that door the instant we leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo with Bonner . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScans were attempted at his trial but never completed. His mind is still \u2018open\u2019 in that sense.\u201d</p><p>Pulling out into the traffic, he put the car into hover-drive, but retained manual control. \u201cThere\u2019s no enforced automatic navigation here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Manhattan is unusual in its rules\u2014likely because of its geography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Feeling the powerful vehicle purr under his hands, he relaxed into the seat and turned his mind to the case . . . and to a truth he wasn\u2019t blind to, no matter the power of what she incited in him. \u201cAre you planning to fuck with me?\u201d</p><p>To Sophia, the question was a rapier sharp thrust between her ribs. \u201cPlease explain your words, Detective.\u201d He\u2019d been so easy a companion over the past few minutes she\u2019d almost forgotten the lethal man she\u2019d met outside that interrogation room in Wyoming. A mistake.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meant to act as a filter\u201d\u2014a stroke of the steel that lay below the beautiful surface\u2014\u201cbut fact is, I can\u2019t be effective if you\u2019re hiding things I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wondered how many suspects he\u2019d fooled into dropping their guard before striking with that precise blade of a voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve just called me stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I, Miss Sophia?\u201d</p><p>Again, he unbalanced her, made her uncertain how to respond. Humans asked her for information, for insight into their cases, sometimes making small talk in the process, but this, what Max was doing . . . she didn\u2019t understand it. \u201cBe blunt, Detective,\u201d she ordered. \u201cI don\u2019t handle subtlety well.\u201d</p><p>Max shot her a look she couldn\u2019t read, but he followed her order. \u201cI need to know whether to treat you as a partner or as a stooge for Councilor Duncan.\u201d</p><p>She thought of the cold-eyed woman who would one day sign her death warrant, ensuring her last days on this earth would be spent as a fugitive; thought, too, of this piercingly intelligent, complex man who made her wish\u2014for one broken second\u2014that she was normal. But she\u2019d lost her chance at any kind of normality in a fracture of razor-sharp glass and screams twenty years ago. \u201cCouncilor Duncan wants you to find the mole in her system,\u201d she said in a voice that came out coated in ice. \u201cI\u2019m to do everything I can to assist you. That is the extent of my brief.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Max said at last, \u201cthis suicide. Kenneth Vale.\u201d</p><p>Sophia brought up the information on her organizer even as she closed the door gently on the past, so as not to awaken the slumbering otherness inside of her. \u201cHe was the Councilor\u2019s specialist in stocks and bonds,\u201d she said, finding an anchor in what she understood, words and data and fact.</p><p>\u201cWhat were the consequences of his death?\u201d A practical question, but his voice had shifted again, the timbre warm, disturbingly intimate in the confines of the car.</p> <p>Her hand slipped a little as her palm turned damp. \u201cShe lost a certain amount of money when news of Vale\u2019s suicide got out. You have to understand, such an act is highly unusual among Psy\u201d\u2014among most Psy\u2014\u201cand is considered a sign of severe mental illness.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s next words hit her without warning. \u201cYou\u2019re not telling me everything.\u201d</p><p>How had he known? She stared at the clean lines of his profile, her eyes lingering at his temple. He was human. All his records proved that without a doubt\u2014and yet the way he read suspects, the way he\u2019d just read her, it reminded her again that she\u2019d have to be very, very careful around him.</p><p>If he realized the extent of the fractures inside of her, if he understood the things the otherness had done . . . She took a slow, careful breath. \u201cIt has no bearing on the case.\u201d</p><p>The look he shot her was brutal in its demand. \u201cI\u2019ll decide what\u2019s relevant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuicide,\u201d she finally said, \u201cis considered an acceptable choice in some circumstances. However, in those cases, the suicide is usually undertaken in a quiet, unobtrusive way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuicide\u2019s never quiet or unobtrusive.\u201d His voice was a whip, cutting across her skin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough shattered families to know that. But . . . Psy don\u2019t do love, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emptiness in her soul, an echoing nothingness where there should\u2019ve been family, should\u2019ve been connection, even if only of the coldest kind. \u201cOften, in cases of severe mental deterioration, the choice is between suicide and rehabilitation.\u201d</p><p>Suicide is the better option, Sophia. Another J, speaking to her two months before he was discovered dead in a hotel room, having overdosed on a carefully calculated cocktail of drugs. At least, you\u2019ll die whole. If they take you, they\u2019ll leave an atrocity behind\u2014a creature that should not exist.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>The minor\u2019s parents have willingly surrendered full custody to the state as she does not appear to have the capacity to manage life in the regular population.</p> <p>\u2014PsyMed report on Sophia Russo, minor, age 8</p><p>Max had been a cop for over a decade. It didn\u2019t take him long to connect the dots. Staring out at the city streets, he tried to wipe out the image of Sophia slipping softly into the last good night, unable to believe that this smart, steely woman would ever give in to death without a fight. \u201cAnd do you think suicide is preferable to rehabilitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the choice is the individual\u2019s.\u201d A pause. \u201cBut if you\u2019re asking if I would ever make that choice\u2014no.\u201d She tapped the screen of her organizer with a little laser pen. \u201cWould you like to talk about the second suspicious death?\u201d</p><p>Convinced by her absolute answer on the issue of suicide, he turned his mind back to the case. \u201cCarmichael Jones,\u201d he said. \u201cMassive coronary in his suite while at a meeting in the Cayman Islands. Maid found him\u2014pathologist ruled he\u2019d been dead for at least two, three hours at that stage.\u201d</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t say anything for almost a minute. Then, \u201cDo you have all this data in your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Startled at the question, he glanced over, caught those night-violet eyes watching him with a focus that felt like a touch. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I have other things in my head.\u201d She dropped her gaze to the screen of the organizer, cutting off that topic, but he felt its shadowy echo all around him.</p><p>His hands clenched on the steering wheel. \u201cDo you have nightmares?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPsy don\u2019t dream.\u201d It was the nonanswer he\u2019d expected, but then she added, \u201cIt\u2019s easy for them to say that,\u201d and he knew Sophia had looked into the abyss and screamed.</p><p>Even as he opened his mouth to reply, she spoke again, and this time, her words were icily pragmatic. \u201cCarmichael Jones was Councilor Duncan\u2019s main advisor in relation to the property arm of her business.\u201d</p><p>Max let her retreat for now. \u201cConstruction\u2019s a big part of her empire from what I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s had a lot of success building changeling-aimed complexes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He considered what he knew of changelings. His friendship with Clay\u2014and another DarkRiver sentinel, Dorian\u2014was solid, but it had been earned through blood. In general, when it came to strangers, the predatory species tended to maintain a reserved distance. \u201cHow did she manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has an agreement with your friends\u2019 pack. I believe it\u2019s proven a beneficial arrangement for both parties.\u201d A little movement as she settled against her seat, the scent of her a tantalizing stroke across his senses. \u201cThere are rumors the SnowDancer wolves are a silent party in many of these deals, but no confirmation.\u201d</p><p>Max whistled. If the cats were chilly when it came to outsiders, the wolves were downright glacial. \u201cDid Carmichael Jones deal with the leopards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nikita is the main contact\u2014which is unusual.\u201d</p><p>Caressing the car through a turn, he shook his head. \u201cNot really\u2014I have a feeling her daughter was meant to be the original lead.\u201d He\u2019d never met Sascha, but he had met her mate, Lucas, briefly during his previous trip to San Francisco\u2014on the trail of another butcher, one who\u2019d eviscerated children like they were so much meat.</p><p>\u201cDetective . . . Max. Are you well?\u201d</p><p>He realized he was squeezing the steering wheel hard enough to turn his skin bloodless. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nightmares, too.\u201d Soft words. \u201cThey always pass.\u201d</p><p>The statement hit him with the force of a ten-ton truck\u2014she was trying, he realized, to comfort him, this J who had more nightmares inside her skull than he\u2019d ever see, even if he lived ten lifetimes. \u201cNikita,\u201d he said, his voice dropping as he fought the urge to bring the car to a halt, to take her into his arms, to comfort her, \u201cprobably took over when Sascha defected.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t pursue the subject of nightmares. \u201cYes, that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sascha is her blood\u201d\u2014he knew better than anyone that that didn\u2019t always mean what it should, but in this case\u2014\u201cmaybe she needs the contact.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shook her head. \u201cNikita cut off Sascha the instant her daughter proved flawed.\u201d</p><p>Her words, coupled with the direction of his thoughts, threatened to pitch him back into the past, into the life of another unwanted child. \u201cDo you think,\u201d he said, slamming the door on those memories, \u201cthat Sascha is flawed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think, only what Councilor Duncan believes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t strike me as a coward, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>Utter stillness. \u201cWhat is it you want from me?\u201d It was an outwardly calm question, but he was certain he heard a bewildered vulnerability beneath the surface.</p><p>It made him feel like a bastard. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to know who you are.\u201d And why she spoke to a part of him that had gone quiet a long, long time ago.</p><p>\u201cNobody,\u201d she said, her tone so flat, he could\u2019ve imagined the soft-voiced woman who\u2019d told him his nightmares would pass. \u201cI\u2019m nobody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophi\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia spoke over him, the dark, broken girl inside her panicked. He was pushing too hard, seeing too much. She wasn\u2019t ready to be exposed to the light, wasn\u2019t ready to bare the scars that scored her from the inside out. \u201cGetting back to the financial situation,\u201d she said, the words coming out in a fast, staccato beat, \u201cthe cumulative effect of her advisors\u2019 deaths, while not huge, has been enough to cause Nikita significant problems in terms of her overall business reputation.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t speak for almost a minute, but when he did, it was about the case.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he\u2019d given up. Max Shannon had scented her weakness. And like the puma she saw in his masculine grace, he wouldn\u2019t let up until he\u2019d drawn first blood.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, in the dark outskirts of Moscow, Councilor Kaleb Krychek got out of bed, having slept roughly two hours. Knowing there would be no more rest, not tonight, he pulled on a pair of pants in a thin, breathable material and went for a run across the night-draped countryside that surrounded his home.</p><p>The earth was hard, almost cutting underneath his uncovered feet, the wind a whip across the skin of his back. He felt none of it, his mind racing through the endless black skies of the PsyNet, the darkness broken only by the stars that represented the minds of the millions of Psy hooked into the network\u2014a network that provided the biofeedback necessary for life.</p><p>Kaleb ignored those minds, his focus on finding the one piece of data the NetMind itself seemed to be hiding from him. Tonight, too, the neosentience that was both the guardian and librarian of the Net\u2014a neosentience that in all other things obeyed Kaleb without question\u2014held him at bay, its shields impenetrable.</p><p>Dropping back fully into the world, he ran at a pace that would\u2019ve surprised those who\u2019d seen him only in the suits he wore as a Councilor, pristine and flawless. That would\u2019ve been their mistake. Because he was a cardinal telekinetic, his psychic strength beyond measure, his eyes\u2014white stars on a spread of black\u2014living pieces of the PsyNet. More, he was the most powerful Tk in the Net\u2014movement was as simple to him as breathing. And tonight, he moved through infinite quiet. Even the nocturnal creatures seemed to have gone to ground.</p><p>Perhaps it was because they\u2019d sensed a more dangerous predator in their midst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Returning home after an hour, his body covered in sweat, he took a shower, then sat down at his desk. The first thing he pulled up was a file on Sophia Russo, not out of any particular interest, but because he made a habit of keeping an eye on what his fellow Councilors were doing. Nikita might\u2019ve been an ally, but theirs was an alliance of expediency, nothing more.</p><p>The J-Psy\u2019s file was detailed, as was the case with most of her designation. And notwithstanding her irregular childhood, and recent appearance on the rehabilitation watchlist, her abilities fell within fairly normal parameters for a J. So why was Nikita so interested in this one particular J? There was no doubt that she was\u2014the request to the J Corps had been very specific.</p><p>Making a mental note to monitor the situation, he was about to pull up another file when he felt something trigger his outermost shields on the PsyNet. Given that those shields were so complex they were all but invisible, he only spared the incident a cursory glance. Many people contacted his shields without realizing it. But then, the intruder made it through those shields.</p> <p>Kaleb opened his psychic eye between one blink and the next.</p><p>The intruder was gone.</p><p>Which in itself was an answer\u2014because anyone good enough to have left without getting caught in one of his traps shouldn\u2019t have triggered the alarm in the first place. \u201cSo,\u201d he murmured on the physical plane, \u201cthe game has begun.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Sensation builds. You may consider a handshake harmless, but each time you touch a human, it threatens your conditioning.</p> <p>\u2014Excerpted from lessons given to Psy children during</p><p>their transition into adult training</p><p>Sophia was more than ready to exit the car by the time Max brought it to a stop in front of a mid-rise building not far from Golden Gate Park\u2014the site of Kenneth Vale\u2019s apartment, the location of his suicide. Sophia had never suffered from a psychological issue that made her vulnerable to claustrophobia, but being in that car with a quietly brooding Max had been . . . unsettling.</p><p>He took up more space than he should, the heat of his body inescapable in the confines of the vehicle. She\u2019d felt as if he was touching her with each wave of that starkly masculine heat\u2014and for a woman who hadn\u2019t been touched in years, it had been an experience that left her scrambling for escape.</p><p>\u201cEntry codes?\u201d Max asked as they walked up the steps, his voice rubbing against her skin like sandpaper.</p><p>Again, it was touch without a touch, something she had no ability to avoid, to process. \u201cI have them here.\u201d She let them into the building and headed toward the elevator security console, her gloved fingers slipping off the pad once before she collected herself.</p> <p>Trembling, Max thought, Sophia was trembling.</p><p>\u201cThis is a very exclusive building.\u201d A calm voice, that betraying hand dropping to her side as the elevator headed down to them. \u201cVale\u2019s position with Councilor Duncan enabled him to secure his privacy to this extent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d Max folded his arms to keep from sliding his hand under her hair, to the soft warmth of her neck so he could tug her to him, so he could apologize for pushing her too hard, too soon, with a slow, sweet kiss\u2014no matter that they\u2019d been strangers only a day ago.</p><p>\u201cBefore these deaths,\u201d he said, forcing himself to maintain a white-knuckled hold on a need that refused to obey the rules of civilized behavior, \u201cI\u2019m guessing being Nikita\u2019s business advisor wasn\u2019t exactly a high-risk position, so why the security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans,\u201d she said, \u201cand the occasional nonpredatory changeling, have a way of expecting things from Psy they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d A meaningful glance out of those vivid, impossible eyes. \u201cVale was, in all probability, protecting himself from those who wanted to pitch to him in person.\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened at that moment. A woman entered the lobby at almost the same instant, swiping a card where Sophia had entered Vale\u2019s access code. \u201cPlease hold the elevator.\u201d</p><p>Max did so, conscious of Sophia all but disappearing into a corner.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The woman\u2019s ruby red smile betrayed her humanity. \u201cAre you moving in? I haven\u2019t seen you before.\u201d</p> <p>Max saw the stranger give him the once-over, recognized it for what it was. Women had been making him offers since before he was legal. And he\u2019d learned to turn them down without hurting their feelings\u2014because in spite of the actions of the woman who\u2019d shaped him, he\u2019d never hated her or those of her sex. Part of him had always wanted to protect her\u2014even as a child, he\u2019d known that no matter what she did to him, her pain was deeper, older, a vicious animal that tore her to pieces from the inside out.</p><p>So today, he gave this woman a small smile. \u201cJust checking the place out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said as the elevator opened on her floor, \u201cif you want to ask any questions about the area, call me.\u201d Passing over a card, she exited, her musky perfume a lingering reminder of her presence.</p><p>Sophia stirred. \u201cShe was playing a mating game with you.\u201d</p><p>Max had been about to drop the card into the small wrought iron recycling bin in the corner, but now slid it into his pocket. If it took jealousy to rouse the real Sophia to the surface, he\u2019d use it without any guilt whatsoever\u2014when a man got kicked this hard in the guts by a woman, anything was fair.</p><p>And the unique individual behind the mask of the perfect J, the one who\u2019d told him Bonner\u2019s victims shouldn\u2019t have to spend eternity in the cold dark\u2014that\u2019s who he wanted to know. \u201cIt\u2019s called flirting.\u201d He shot her a slow, deliberately provocative smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure you must\u2019ve seen humans do it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the physical type that attracts you?\u201d Aware she should back off, but unable to stop pushing for an answer, Sophia stepped out of the elevator on Vale\u2019s floor. \u201cTall, slender, with a fashionable-dress preference?\u201d</p><p>Max gestured to the left of the quiet, carpeted corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s his place.\u201d Letting her pass him so she could input the code that would disengage the locks, he pushed open the door. \u201cAnd,\u201d he said in a voice that made the tiny hairs on the back of her nape rise in warning as she walked in ahead of him, \u201cthe answer to your question is no. That woman didn\u2019t do it for me.\u201d He pushed the door shut behind them. \u201cNow a small woman with dangerous curves . . . I could bite into her.\u201d</p><p>She froze, certain she was misreading the comment, but suddenly very conscious of the way her lower body filled out her jeans. \u201cDetective Shannon,\u201d she said, turning to face him, \u201cyou\u2019re being highly inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>His lips kicked up at the corners. \u201cYou started it.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to trace the shape of those lips, wanted it so badly her fingers cramped as she fisted them. Her Silence had been fragmenting for years\u2014an inevitable side effect of her work as a J, and one for which the J Corps had a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy. So long as the medics didn\u2019t find any evidence, the J Corps Management Board wouldn\u2019t turn in a fractured J. It was partly an economic decision in order to retain the number of active Js . . . and partly because everyone in the Corps had looked into the chasm of madness at some point in their lives.</p><p>Though Sophia hadn\u2019t allowed herself to think about the truth even within her own mind, conscious of how deep M-Psy could dig, her conditioning had broken close to completely earlier this year, her mind twined with strange, dark tendrils that rebuffed Silence; and the reconditioning she\u2019d undergone only the previous day had already been sloughed off like so much dead skin. But in spite of it all, she\u2019d been able to hold up the facade, the pretense of being the perfect Psy. Until now.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Sophia.\u201d A husky order, and to her surprise, he took a step back, began to walk around Vale\u2019s living area. \u201cThis room is set up for entertaining\u2014or maybe meetings, since I\u2019m guessing Psy don\u2019t do parties?\u201d</p><p>She forced her brain to function, to provide him with the answers. \u201cActually,\u201d she said, the words coming sluggishly as she fought the confusion created by his mere presence, \u201ccocktail parties are held when there are human or changeling clients. It\u2019s all about putting the other side at ease.\u201d</p><p>Some Psy could even manage a glacial kind of charm\u2014Councilor Kaleb Krychek had an unusual number of admirers in the non-Psy population. She couldn\u2019t understand why. Yes, aesthetically speaking, he was the epitome of a cold male beauty. But he was also, she was certain, quite capable of snapping his admirers\u2019 necks without the least pause should the occasion call for it.</p><p>\u201cDo you know if Vale received business clients in here outside of any social events?\u201d Max\u2019s expression was all cop when she dared meet his gaze again. Yet, embers continued to burn in the depths of those near-black eyes. He made no effort to hide them, no effort to pretend that things were as they should\u2019ve been between an Enforcement detective and a Silent J.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Could Max share that warmth, she wondered, thaw the frost in her soul, frost that had begun to form when she\u2019d been a traumatized eight-year-old strapped helpless to a hospital bed? Could he fix her? \u201cSome humans don\u2019t like to be seen consorting with Psy.\u201d It was a question\u2014vital, necessary, powerful\u2014couched as a statement.</p><p>Max peeled off his Windbreaker, bunching the black material in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t like the Psy,\u201d he said with blunt honesty. \u201cI don\u2019t like how they mess with human minds and pervert justice so the Council can get what it wants.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known that, of course she\u2019d known that.

Cops and Js have always gone together.\u201d He held her gaze until she looked away, scrambling to find her footing by reciting the minutiae of the case in her mind. Because what he\u2019d just offered, it was something she wanted so badly that if she dared reach for it and he drew back his hand, it would push her the final step into an irrevocable insanity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSophie.\u201d A quiet demand.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s not much left inside me, Max.\u201d Sometimes, all she heard were echoes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to play the games that woman was playing with you.\u201d</p><p>Max sucked in a breath, blindsided by Sophia\u2019s stark honesty. It stripped away the sophisticated rituals of the dance between male and female, allowing no room for illusions and half-truths. He could\u2019ve pulled back, but he\u2019d made his choice\u2014to follow this strange, powerful attraction through to the end. \u201cNo games,\u201d he said, holding her gaze. \u201cNot between us.\u201d</p> <p>She took a long breath. \u201cI\u2019m Psy, Max.\u201d Not a rejection . . . a reminder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a J.\u201d Turning away, he dropped his Windbreaker on the back of a nearby sofa before crouching to examine the small glass cabinet below the comm console. Several data crystals lay neatly within. \u201cMight be something here.\u201d</p><p>He saw Sophia tug at her gloves to ensure every inch of her skin was covered before she extended her hand to accept the crystals. Reading the tense line of her body, the desolate simplicity of her earlier words still circling in his head, he dropped them into her palm with care, avoiding physical contact. \u201cNot likely to be entertainment,\u201d he said, rising to his feet. \u201cNews footage?\u201d</p><p>She bent to place the crystals on the small beveled coffee table in the center of the room. \u201cHe may have kept business documents within easy reach\u201d\u2014the words were cool, Psy, but he\u2019d seen the mask fall, wasn\u2019t fooled\u2014\u201cthings that weren\u2019t sensitive. They were probably left behind to help the psychologists create a full mental profile.\u201d She gestured down the corridor. \u201cHe took his life in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Max walked to the room where Kenneth Vale had spent his last minutes on this earth, slowly, painfully choking to death. \u201cYou should look at this,\u201d he said to Sophia, \u201cthe image in the file doesn\u2019t really convey the impact.\u201d</p> <p>Moving to stand beside Max in the doorway, confident that for all his relentless will, he wouldn\u2019t touch her without invitation, Sophia looked up and to the gleaming meat hook that hung from the bedroom ceiling. \u201cThe fact that he went to the trouble of screwing it into the ceiling was tabled as evidence of his disturbed state.\u201d Her thoughts flashed to another crime scene photo\u2014Vale\u2019s face contorted, his tongue grotesquely swollen. He\u2019d evacuated his bowels, his expensive wool trousers stained with death.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance to read the full report on the plane,\u201d Max said, his gaze still on the brutal shine of the meat hook. \u201cHow did the investigators explain the fact that there were scratches around his neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he realized the irreversible nature of his actions when it was too late.\u201d Death was forever. She\u2019d learned that truth young and had never been given a chance to forget.</p><p>\u201cHe was a fairly decent telepath, right?\u201d At her nod, tiny lines fanned out from the corners of his eyes. \u201cThen someone must\u2019ve heard him cry out for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey identified Jax in his bloodstream,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cThe general consensus is that he was disoriented by a drug haze, couldn\u2019t find the door out of his own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my Psy expert\u2014tell me if that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Mental pathways could twist, could turn, could shatter . . . especially if you were a hunted child, terrified and screaming. \u201cHowever, Vale had no indicators of any prior drug use\u2014and it seems to me that if he was going to take drugs to dull the edge, he would\u2019ve simply suicided by that method, using far more effective agents.\u201d</p><p>Making a hmming sound low in his throat, Max went to the naked white of the floor below where Vale had taken his life, the carpet having been cut away. \u201cPlus, it just doesn\u2019t fit the profile PsyMed had of him before he died.\u201d Looking around, he grabbed a chair sitting in one corner of the room and brought it to that barren patch of floor. \u201cThe fact that everyone was so ready to believe the suicide verdict in spite of all that tells me the Psy are in more trouble than anyone knows.\u201d</p><p>She watched him stand on the chair, her fingers gripping the doorjamb at the sudden transposition of his body with Vale\u2019s. \u201cMax?\u201d His name spilled out, the broken girl inside of her scared, so scared. He was too close to the evil. What if it touched him, this man with his unexpected smiles and his eyes that saw her?</p><p>Max tugged on the hook, his biceps defined as he placed his weight on the ugly object. \u201cStrong, but it had to be\u2014he was hanging here for at least an hour or two before he was found, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to think. \u201cTime of death suggests that.\u201d Years of experience sparked her neurons to life, notwithstanding the chill of terror. \u201cHowever, he wasn\u2019t seen for two days beforehand.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes met hers. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>Disconcerted by the moment of perfect understanding outside of any psychic connection, she vocalized her conclusions. \u201cYou believe someone was holding him drugged and hostage during the time it took to install the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not the whole time, but part of it, yeah.\u201d Jumping off the chair, he returned it to its previous position. \u201cThe whole thing smells like a setup\u2014theater for the public.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCouncilor Duncan was able to keep a lid on the details.\u201d</p><p>Max raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou telling me no one whispered about it on your PsyNet? According to what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s a clearinghouse for pretty much every scrap of data known to Psy around the world.\u201d</p><p>She rarely entered the Net these days. There was too much there, too many voices, too many thoughts\u2014it was akin to being battered in a storm-tossed sea, each stray whisper, each murmur, a body blow. \u201cYes, you\u2019re probably correct,\u201d she said, suddenly realizing that Max had a tiny scar high up on his left cheekbone. The tips of her fingers tingled, wanting to touch, to trace, to learn.</p><p>Max\u2019s expression changed. \u201cDo it.\u201d A quiet, intense command from a human who saw far too much.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Not won\u2019t, Max thought, can\u2019t. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She looked away . . . but then returned to hold his gaze. Strong, he thought, she was stronger than she knew, this J who\u2019d told him she didn\u2019t have much left in her. \u201cI\u2019m now a Sensitive.\u201d She spread her fingers between them. \u201cI pick up thoughts through touch.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath as his mind filled with images of her sitting in that room with Bonner\u2019s malicious presence only inches away, the skin of her face, her neck so naked, so very vulnerable. \u201cWhat would happen if someone disturbed touched your skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was lucky, I\u2019d go into shock. More likely, the avalanche of images would shear my telepathic shields and kill me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, staring at those slender gloved fingers he\u2019d fantasized about having all over him. \u201cHow long since you\u2019ve touched another person?\u201d It came out harsh, raw with a need that felt as if it had had years to grow, to mature.</p><p>Eyes the color of heat lightning met his, overflowing with a loneliness so absolute, it had no end. \u201cFour years.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Sascha Duncan, cardinal E-Psy, mate to the alpha of the strongest leopard pack in the country, and a woman known for her calm in the midst of a crisis, threw a half-a-million dollar book against the wall.</p><p>Regret struck almost immediately, and she caught the book using her minor telekinetic ability before it hit, but frustration continued to churn within her. According to Alice Eldridge\u2019s seminal work on E-Psy, a cardinal empath should have the capacity to stop a riot of thousands in its tracks, but Sascha couldn\u2019t even control five people. Those five had been volunteers, packmates who trusted her enough to allow her to attempt to feed peaceful emotions into them\u2014after they purposefully got themselves excited.</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work!\u201d Rubbing her hand over the hard mound of her pregnant belly, she stomped outside to find her shirtless mate replacing a window on the left-hand side of their cabin. The aerie above that cabin was now off-limits. Lucas tended to snarl at her if she even teased him about trying to climb up.</p><p>\u201cSascha darling,\u201d he now said, wiping finger marks off the newly installed pane of glass using his discarded T-shirt, \u201cnext time your hellion fan club wants to play catch, I suggest Dorian\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Her \u201chellion fan club\u201d was composed of twin cubs, Roman and Julian\u2014and Dorian\u2019s house was made of glass. Normally that kind of a distinctly feline comment would\u2019ve made her laugh. Today, she kicked bad-temperedly at the forest floor. \u201cThat book just assumes so much knowledge. As if I\u2019m supposed to magically pluck the information out of the ether!\u201d Another kick. \u201cWhat kind of a thesis is that? Shouldn\u2019t a doctoral student know better than to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSascha?\u201d</p><p>She snapped up her head, all but growling, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her mate leaned forward in a deceptively slow move, snagged her shoulders, and kissed her. And kept on kissing her until she melted, closing her hands over the warm silk of the skin that covered his muscular shoulders. \u201cYou need a haircut,\u201d she murmured into the kiss. The black strands were long enough to brush the backs of her hands.</p><p>He kissed her again, his lips smiling against hers. \u201cI\u2019m scared of scissors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuses.\u201d She stroked her fingers through the strands. \u201cYou just like girls going crazy over your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d A warm, loving stroke over her belly. \u201cHow\u2019s our rock star doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoud as always.\u201d She\u2019d been able to sense the life force of their baby from a couple of weeks after conception. At five months, that tiny life was now a constant presence in the back of her mind, normally content, often happy, and sometimes delighted. Like now. Their baby knew its father\u2019s voice, his presence. \u201cThank you for the kiss.\u201d The unspoken support. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hardship keeping up with your demands\u201d\u2014a mock sigh\u2014\u201cbut someone\u2019s got to do it.\u201d Another nibbling, laughing kiss when she snarled at him\u2014and she was getting quite good at it after the number of times he\u2019d done it to her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said after he had her breathless, \u201cthe funneling emotion trick didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it did. But only for a short period. I can\u2019t hold it for longer than maybe thirty seconds.\u201d Turning, she leaned her back against his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019m missing.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas\u2019s arm came around her upper chest, holding her to him. \u201cHave you considered talking to Dev?\u201d he asked, referring to the leader of the Forgotten\u2014Psy who\u2019d left the Net over a hundred years ago and formed their own society.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of doing that.\u201d She gripped his arm. \u201cI wish . . . I wish Nikita had known the joy I feel now. I wonder sometimes if she heard me like I do our baby, or if Silence blocks that connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must,\u201d Lucas said, brushing his lips over her temple, the scent of him a stroke of wildness touched with clean male sweat. \u201cHow else could a woman carry a child for nine months and not love it with every beat of her heart?\u201d</p><p>Sascha felt a deep sorrow for the indescribable beauty of what her mother had missed. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll care that she\u2019ll soon have a grandchild?\u201d They\u2019d managed to keep the pregnancy under wraps from the general public so far\u2014helped in part by the way the baby sat on her frame, and by clever use of clothing\u2014but it\u2019d soon become impossible to hide the wonderful truth.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s free hand slipped between them to massage her lower back with strong, circular strokes. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d She pressed a kiss to his biceps. \u201cI\u2019ll melt if you keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>But her panther had turned serious. \u201cDo you want to see your mother, kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>The records of your birth were destroyed during a fire twenty-five years ago, unfortunately before they had been archived. We are very sorry to be unable to help you in your search.</p><p>\u2014Sisters of Hope Hospital, City of New York,</p> <p>to Max Shannon, January 2079</p><p>Max and Sophia didn\u2019t speak again until they were well on their way to the private garage where Nikita had stashed the vehicle the third presumed victim had been driving when she died.</p><p>\u201cIs it just the disturbed that you have to be careful of?\u201d Max\u2019s mind was still reeling at the realization that this woman whose skin he\u2019d wanted to stroke from the very first, whose body sang a siren song to his, might be forever out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cMost cops,\u201d Sophia said in a quiet, even tone that cut as deep as a scalpel, \u201ccarry as many nightmares as a J. Touching one would be akin to slamming a lightning bolt into my head.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched on the steering wheel as she continued to speak. \u201cAll Psy run the risk of becoming Sensitive, but Js tend to have the highest rates of actual onset. To counteract that, the Council once considered banning touch from the instant of birth, but there proved to be certain . . . undesirable consequences to such a course of action. Tactile aversion is taught to us as part of the final stages of our conditioning.\u201d</p><p>Max thought of the hours, the days he\u2019d spent locked in a dark box, without any hope of a kind touch when he was finally let out, and knew that no matter the horror, he\u2019d been lucky. Because he\u2019d seen pictures of twentieth-century orphanages where babies had been left to rot in their cribs. Those children had been damaged beyond repair. \u201cI can\u2019t see a Psy rocking her baby to sleep,\u201d he said, feeling a tug deep in his soul.</p><p>He\u2019d rock his child to sleep, no damn question about it. No son\u2014or daughter\u2014of his was ever going to wonder what was so wrong with him that his own parent couldn\u2019t bear the sight of him. \u201cWhat kind of touch,\u201d he said, swallowing the knife blade of pain that was his past, \u201cis permitted during childhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurses hold children during feedings, walk around with them at times. Contact is prescribed at the optimal level to ensure psychological health.\u201d</p> <p>It sounded so cold, so clinical. But the hell of it was, it was better care than he\u2019d ever had. When he\u2019d been very small and helpless, perhaps his mother had felt a surge of maternal love? But Max didn\u2019t think so. Hate that deep, that violent, took time to grow, to mature.</p><p>A small light flashed once on Sophia\u2019s organizer, snapping his attention back to the present. \u201cAnything important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just an update on one of my cases from the prosecuting attorney. We won.\u201d She put a hand on the dash to brace herself as the car came to a sudden halt upon sensing the dog that had darted into the road.</p><p>Max scowled at the owner of the little terrier but let it go at that. Getting the car running again, he glanced to his left. \u201cThis is it.\u201d Time to focus on the case\u2014rather than his impossible fascination with a J who might go mad . . . might die, if he touched her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know much about cars?\u201d Sophia asked as they walked to the garage entrance, tugging at her gloves in a gesture she recognized as anxious. She couldn\u2019t help it, her nerves abraded\u2014the more she was around Max, the more she found herself thinking about the faint hope that had taken shape in the back of her mind when she\u2019d read his file.</p><p>Max shoved his own hands into his pockets, his stride unconsciously graceful. It made another forbidden thought surface in the darkest, most secret corner of her mind\u2014a thought tied to the whispered intimacy of sex. She\u2019d never before considered the act, one that would tear apart the final fragile threads of her psyche, but today she found she didn\u2019t want to die without seeing Max Shannon\u2019s naked body move with that powerful liquid grace.</p><p>She was so consumed by the fantasy it took her a moment to realize he was speaking.</p><p>\u201c. . . hoping to talk to the mechanic who actually went over it. If she\u2019s not on shift, we\u2019ll just take a look at the vehicle, come back later to talk to her face-to-face. I\u2019m no expert on cars, but I want to read her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sophia managed to say as they reached the entrance\u2014to be met by a well-groomed young female in blue overalls. Her name tag identified her as the chief mechanic.</p><p>\u201cDetective Shannon, Ms. Russo, please follow me.\u201d With that, she led them toward an isolated and sealed workroom at the very back of the garage. \u201cThis was Allison Marceau\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>Eyes on the crumpled wreck of what had once been a dark green sedan, Max blew out a surprised breath. The majority of cars these days survived most impacts with the passenger cage intact. This was so much spaghetti. \u201cCar versus tree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut near Modesto,\u201d the mechanic answered, heading to the computer station built into the large workbench at the back of the room. \u201cShe was discovered by the leopards after they heard the sound of the initial impact.\u201d</p><p>Max made a mental note to talk to Clay, find out anything that may not have made it into the official files\u2014Psy, and even many humans, had a tendency to disregard the acute nature of changeling senses. Could be the cats had scented something that could\u2019ve caused the crash\u2014maybe even caught a hint of another person in the vicinity. \u201cYou did the work on this yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pulled up something on the screen in front of her. \u201cAccording to the data stored in the onboard computer,\u201d the mechanic continued, \u201cMs. Marceau didn\u2019t brake but accelerated on the turn.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stepped up beside the other woman. \u201cThat\u2019s not in the file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouncilor Duncan asked me to keep it out of the official record.\u201d</p><p>Sophia glanced at him, her unspoken thought clear. Suicide?</p><p>\u201cFunny coincidence,\u201d he murmured under his breath. \u201cIs it possible,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the car could\u2019ve been rigged so that the brake was read as the accelerator by the computer?\u201d</p><p>The mechanic replied with a positive answer, but said she needed more time to investigate. \u201cThe computer\u2019s memory chip was severely damaged in the crash\u2014it took me close to two weeks to retrieve what information we have at present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you find out,\u201d Max said, writing down his cell code for her, \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes and a few more questions later, Max and Sophia exited the garage into the crisp air of San Francisco. \u201cLet\u2019s walk. I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>They were almost a hundred yards down the slight slope before he vocalized his thoughts. \u201cHumans aren\u2019t the only ones vulnerable to psychic attack. If the car\u2019s systems prove clean, then Allison Marceau could\u2019ve been coerced to do what she did.\u201d</p><p>Sophia realized she was walking too close to him, close enough to feel the rough caress of his body heat. \u201cThe psychic control of the aggressor would have to be considerable.\u201d His arm brushed hers, a hard, warm stroke. \u201cMarceau was a Gradient 7 telepath.\u201d A warning shrieked in her head, but she didn\u2019t move away. \u201cHer shields would have been airtight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you need,\u201d Max said, his gaze distant, \u201cis a crack, a fissure.\u201d</p><p>Her arm burned where he\u2019d touched up against it, and though she knew it for a psychosomatic reaction, the contact having been muted by the layers of clothing between them, she clung to the sensation. \u201cI\u2019m certain Councilor Duncan would\u2019ve weeded out anyone whose conditioning was suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of Sascha,\u201d she said, shifting a single dangerous inch closer to the living heat of him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider that a parallel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His hair lifted in the breeze blowing off the bay, baring the clean, perfect lines of his face.</p><p>\u201cPsy are almost obsessive about bloodlines,\u201d she said, her thoughts buried in memories of a past that proved the truth of that assertion beyond any doubt. \u201cIt\u2019s a loyalty unlike human loyalty; nevertheless, it is loyalty.\u201d Compared to human love, Psy familial loyalty was a wintry, practical thing. And it was very much conditional. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia had failed to meet those conditions as a child, and it had cost her her parents\u2019 allegiance.

And the lost, painfully lonely part of her wanted to walk through that door so desperately that she found the words. \u201cYour mother was inadequate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe hated me,\u201d he said, his tone austere, as distant as his expression. \u201cTruly hated me. I don\u2019t know why she carried me to term, because I\u2019m certain she wanted to kill me the instant I was born.\u201d</p><p>Sophia tried to glimpse in this hard-edged cop the vulnerable child he must\u2019ve been. She couldn\u2019t. But she did understand a truth that \u201creal\u201d Psy weren\u2019t supposed to understand. \u201cIt hurt you,\u201d she said, attempting to say the right thing, to hold on to his trust. No one had ever shared such a private thing with her out of choice. It made her heart turn oddly heavy, a thick ache in her chest.</p><p>\u201cShe died when I was fifteen.\u201d Words that sounded calm, but his voice was sandpaper against her skin, harsh, rough. \u201cAnd the hell of it was, I missed her. Even though she\u2019d given me up to foster care more than once, treated me worse than you would a dog when I was home, I missed her.\u201d A rush of wind rippled through his hair at that moment, and it seemed to act like a spray of cold water. He blinked, shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know either, but she hoarded the memory in the secret part of her that no reconditioning had ever been able to reach or erase. Everything in her wanted to return his gift in kind, to tell him that she comprehended the agony he must\u2019ve gone through, but trust was such an unfamiliar territory that she floundered, the words stuck in her throat.</p><p>And Max blew out a breath. \u201cMust be the sea air, bringing up old memories.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s time for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>The dinner proved interesting. Sophia, this J who kept short-circuiting Max\u2019s defenses with her gift of listening with a total and absolute focus, was less Psy in her mannerisms than others he\u2019d met, and though she was reserved, she did join in the conversation\u2014dominated by Clay and Tally\u2019s two adopted children, Jon and Noor.</p><p>It made Max\u2019s protective instincts relax to see them all so robustly happy. But what intrigued him most was that Sophia ate the sweet crab flesh he put on her plate\u2014though she\u2019d ordered a simple fillet of fish in white sauce for her own meal. There was nothing on her face to betray whether or not she enjoyed the taste of the crab, but she didn\u2019t reject any of his offerings. And several times, he caught her looking at him as if she wanted to speak, those amazing eyes almost indigo.</p><p>He\u2019d glimpsed that same look on her face when he told her about his mother. That was a truth he\u2019d never shared with anyone\u2014that he\u2019d told her, a woman, a Psy, he\u2019d barely met, scared the hell out of him. It was tempting to pull back, to raise a wall of formality between them\u2014he knew she\u2019d get the message, she was too smart, too perceptive not to\u2014but he\u2019d made a promise.</p><p>No games.</p><p>And, the fact of the matter was, her ability to unsettle him notwithstanding, he didn\u2019t want to keep his distance from Sophia Russo. No, he wanted her from the lush beauty of her mouth to the ripe curves of her hips, to the unadorned honesty that had slapped him sideways more than once already.</p><p>If this was obsession, he thought as they exited the elevator and headed down to their apartments after returning home, then so be it. \u201cSophia,\u201d he said, staring at her gloved hands and\u2014driven by the determination he had to possess her, hold her, break through the veil of her Silence\u2014seeing a sudden, gaping hole in the web of her logic.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d She spoke again before he could respond. \u201cDid your friend confirm whether Allison Marceau said anything when she was found?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d picked up on that short conversation he\u2019d had with Clay when they\u2019d gone for a walk along the pier following dinner. \u201cHe said the boys who found her were adamant she didn\u2019t speak. No suspicious scents at the scene either.\u201d</p><p>Taking out her keycard, Sophia unlocked her door, the movement a fraction too fast. Max\u2019s instincts uncurled in anticipation\u2014she was trying to get away from him, which meant she already knew what he\u2019d just realized . . . and she was sensitive enough to his moods that she\u2019d picked up the tension that had turned his muscles rigid.</p><p>He tried to catch her eye, failed. \u201cI have a question.\u201d</p><p>She pushed open the door. \u201cWe can talk tomorrow. I should get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Max wasn\u2019t about to let her escape. \u201cHave you ever,\u201d he said in a low murmur, \u201ctried to touch someone with a natural mental shield?\u201d</p><p>Sophia froze. \u201cNo, such people are rare.\u201d And none of them had ever been right.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known I had one?\u201d A dark, intense question.</p> <p>\u201cFrom the start.\u201d She walked inside the apartment, conscious of both the corridor surveillance and the fact that the pristine surface of her Silence was beginning to crack like so much glass.</p><p>Max followed, closing the door with a muted snick that did nothing to lessen the tension that made her chest tight, the air suddenly too thin. \u201cThen why did you let me think my shields would make no difference?\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d break if this failed, Sophia thought, scrabbling to find a mental foothold. Max, with his intelligence, his smiles, his will to find those lost girls . . . he wasn\u2019t only right, he was the embodiment of every forbidden dream born in the forever shattered part of her psyche. This man would\u2019ve come for her\u2014when she\u2019d been hurt and bleeding in that cabin where the others had died, he would have come for her.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question, Sophia.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d already become used to hearing him call her Sophie. The loss sliced a line of blood across her soul. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t relevant.\u201d She had to fight this pull, had to keep him at a distance. To take the chance and destroy that final flickering hope . . . no, she couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cWe\u2019re colleagues\u2014touch has nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s playing games?\u201d A single calm sentence that tore her defenses apart.</p><p>She looked up, saw the embers in that near-black gaze. And watched as he walked forward until they were separated by a bare foot of distance . . . to hold out a hand, his jaw a taut line, challenge in every part of him.</p><p>She stared at that hand. If she took it and his natural shield wasn\u2019t protection enough, Max\u2019s memories would punch into her with the force of a raging tornado\u2014and if she somehow survived the vicious power of that telepathic blow, she\u2019d know him without ever knowing him, all his secrets, all his yesterdays an endless roar inside her skull.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Sophie.\u201d A command that vibrated with masculine anger . . . and a darker, richer emotion that caressed a burn across her skin. \u201cWe need to know the answer\u2014and don\u2019t you dare tell me you don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>At that moment, faced with a Max who was making no effort whatsoever to hide the steel of his nature, a Max who was forcing her to confront the truth of this strange, unexpected something between them, Sophia discovered she had another flaw\u2014a hitherto unknown susceptibility to that tone in his voice. \u201cI need to check if I sense you through the glove.\u201d Reaching out before the fear could take over, make her turn back, she grazed the tips of her fingers across his palm.</p><p>His fingers curled inward even as she retreated\u2014as if he\u2019d hold her. \u201cSo?\u201d A rough demand that rubbed the sandpaper deeper across her skin.</p><p>\u201cI sense only your body heat.\u201d Wild and hot and an invitation that made a sumptuous warmth ignite in her abdomen, the broken part of her craving more . . . and yet utterly terrified at taking this chance. \u201cI\u2019ll recite the alphabet,\u201d she said, knowing he wouldn\u2019t allow her to turn back, wouldn\u2019t allow her to hide. \u201cIf I go quiet\u201d\u2014she tugged off a glove\u2014\u201cbreak contact.\u201d</p><p>Max dropped his hand without warning. \u201cThose eyes . . . the things I see in them.\u201d A low, harsh word. \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t push you, and what the fuck am I doing but exactly that? Jesus.\u201d He shoved his hands through his hair, his shoulders twisting as if he\u2019d turn, walk away.</p><p>And she knew the decision was hers. To hide, to pull back before promise ever broke under the pressure of reality . . . or to defy fear and reach for a man who made her wish for something so impossible, it was surely a little piece of madness.</p><p>\u201cI would know you, Max.\u201d Soft words in a voice that had already become exquisitely, intimately familiar, gentle bonds that held Max in place. \u201cBefore . . . I would know you.\u201d Closing the distance between them, Sophia waited until he lifted his hand . . . and then she stroked her fingers across the very center of his palm.</p><p>It was an electric shock that went straight to Max\u2019s gut. Hissing out a breath, he curled his fingers into a fist even as she dropped her own hand and took a jerking step backward.</p><p>\u201cSophia?\u201d Deep-seated instinct shoved at him to go to her, cup her face in his hands. Keeping himself in position was the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done. \u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d It savaged him that he might have hurt her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I apologize\u2014I\u2019m fine.\u201d But she was staring at his hand, a quaver in her voice. \u201cI felt none of your memories. You\u2019re as blank as a piece of wood.\u201d</p><p>Relief was a fucking fist inside his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve been called hardheaded before, but never wooden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to offend.\u201d</p><p>It was oh-so-tempting to touch his lips to hers, to tease her by telling her that she could make it up to him, but given the way she was standing so stiff and shocked, he knew he\u2019d have to wait for his first taste of the lushly enticing Sophia Russo. \u201cI was playing with you, Sophie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He flexed his hand, saw her eyes go to it. \u201cYou felt it, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Shifting away in a sudden movement, she walked around him to open the door to her apartment. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, Max.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia stood with her back to the door she\u2019d closed behind Max until she heard his own door open and close. Only then did she slide down the wall to sit with her legs stretched out in front of her, her entire body buzzing in a way that was simply not in the realm of her experience.</p><p>She looked at her right hand, running the pad of her thumb over her fingertips in a bewildered attempt to understand that electrifying burst of sensation. It had been . . . she had no words for it, no way to explain something so wild, so extreme it defied her efforts at categorization.</p><p>The true paradox was that she hadn\u2019t lied\u2014no matter the almost painful sensation of the contact, Max was as silent to her psychic senses as a piece of wood or a block of plascrete.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>For the first time in her life, that word meant something other than the conditioning that had acted as a cage even as it kept her alive. Max had been a wall of pure silence, an unexpected oasis in a world filled with noise. But her response to his touch had wiped out that startling peace.</p> <p>She stared at her hand again. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Max knew the answer, she thought, she\u2019d seen it on his face. But the question was\u2014did she want to know the answer?</p><p>A telepathic knock sounded in her mind the instant after that thought passed through it. Recognizing the signature of her boss in Justice, Jay Khanna, she pulled together the threads of her perfect facade and said, Sir. He wouldn\u2019t guess at the reality of her condition. No one else ever had. Even the M-Psy saw only the fragmentation of her telepathic shields\u2014to them, it was a simple psychic issue, nothing to do with the scars she wore deep inside, where no one could see them.</p><p>Ms. Russo, I need to go over part of the Valentine case with you.</p><p>Sophia waited. She\u2019d long ago learned how to bury her true thoughts, her true self, in order to survive.</p><p>According to your notes, when you recovered Ms. Valentine\u2019s memories, you saw her stab her husband seventeen times?</p> <p>That\u2019s correct, sir. A human-to-human spousal murder wouldn\u2019t normally have merited J involvement, but Ms. Valentine was the daughter of an influential individual with a controlling interest in a major power plant. Valentine Senior had used the same thing Max had\u2014a natural shield\u2014to ruthless advantage in business, until even Psy \u201cplayed nice\u201d with him.</p><p>Sophia had often wondered why the Council hadn\u2019t had him discreetly assassinated, and come to the conclusion that the male provided undisclosed goods or services that were valuable enough to afford him some protection. Humans, driven and shaped by their unpredictable emotional natures, often came up with ideas and concepts that were staggeringly unique. It was why Max had caught Gerard Bonner while the Psy profilers were still arguing about the \u201cpsychological parameters\u201d that defined the sociopath.</p><p>How many times, Jay Khanna now said, did you see her husband abuse her in the days leading up to the murder?</p><p>Sophia betrayed no surprise\u2014part of her had been expecting the question since the moment she met the arrogantly beautiful Emilie Valentine. None, sir.</p><p>Think about that carefully, Ms. Russo. We\u2019ll speak again before the case goes to trial.</p><p>Letting the veiled order fade from her mind, Sophia considered what her response would be on Jay\u2019s next telepathic visit. The ability to \u201cbend\u201d memories was the most tightly guarded secret of the Justice Corps. Everyone thought Js could only project what was already in a defendant\u2019s mind. In most cases, yes.</p><p>But there was a select group of Js who had the ability to manipulate memories without leaving a trace, changing images and words, sounds and actions until a simple tumble down a set of stairs could be made to look like an abusive push.</p><p>Sophia was one of the best, had been brilliant at it even as a child. Because she\u2019d spent every spare moment honing the skill, aware that that nascent ability was one of only two reasons why the decision makers had let her live after she\u2019d been ruined from the inside out, her mind a place where nothing quite made sense anymore.</p> <p>Nobody ever asked, and she never told . . . but the splinters in her soul were permanent. She\u2019d never recovered from the terror-filled days she\u2019d spent trapped in that cabin in the mountains, never again understood the world as she had before the glass cut her face to shreds.</p><p>Max finally fell asleep late into the night, his body still humming with his violent response to Sophia\u2019s fleeting touch. So in a sense, he\u2019d expected the intensity of his dreams . . . but not their subject.</p><p>\u201cYou little shit!\u201d Hands shaking him hard, so hard, as a screaming mouth spewed obscenities at him.</p><p>He stood frozen, trying not to cry. He couldn\u2019t cry. That would only make her more mad.</p><p>\u201cJust like your father.\u201d It was screamed into his face. \u201cPiece of filth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and he couldn\u2019t help it, his voice broke.</p><p>For an instant, her face went unnaturally calm. There were no more screams, no more painful shakes. She just stared at him.</p><p>And he knew that his mother wanted to suffocate the life out of him.</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes snapped open, his hand going for the stunner under his pillow. It took him close to two minutes to realize the danger was only in his head. She\u2019d almost killed him in the memory, come so close that sweat broke out along his spine even now, his skin taut with remembered terror.</p><p>Getting up, he walked into the bathroom to throw cold water on his face.</p><p>It snapped the remaining threads of the dream, his mind beginning to function again. The connection was indisputable\u2014Sophia, a J, had touched him . . . and he\u2019d had a dream from when he\u2019d been small, so small that he couldn\u2019t have been more than three at the time. He\u2019d never before remembered anything from that period of his life.</p><p>The consequences of further contact didn\u2019t escape him\u2014but when it came to Sophia Russo, Max had no intention of retreating.</p><p>Max invited Sophia into the privacy of his apartment the next morning when she came to meet him for the drive to Nikita\u2019s office. Shadows bruised the skin beneath her eyes, her bones cutting blades against that normally lush skin. \u201cTough night?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI should know better than anyone that memories are never gone,\u201d she said in an echo of his own thoughts, \u201cbut even I, it seems, have some delusions left.\u201d</p><p>Raising his hand with a slowness that gave her plenty of warning, he began to play with a lock of her hair. She went preternaturally still, but she didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cMemories aren\u2019t always vicious,\u201d he said, speaking to both of them. \u201cI\u2019ll remember the softness of your hair each time I smell your shampoo. Let\u2019s see, vanilla and\u201d\u2014he paused, took a long, indulgent breath\u2014\u201cbelow it, some kind of a flower?\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, she answered. \u201cLavender soap. I use it on my body.\u201d Then she lifted her own hand, hesitated.</p><p>He bent his head in invitation, his heart kicking against his ribs. Slow, Max, he ordered himself, take it fucking slow. He waited for her fingertips to stroke through his hair, however she touched not his hair . . . but his lips.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t control the shudder that rippled through him. The leather-synth of her glove was warm with her body heat, the pressure so slight as to be nonexistent\u2014but it held him captive, slave to her desires.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she whispered, tracing the shape of his mouth, \u201cwill be a good memory.\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to surrender to the pleasure, but she\u2019d come to him with nightmares in her eyes. \u201cTell me about your dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your mother hated you,\u201d she said, the harshness of the words nullified by the delicate way she stroked over his lower lip, as if fascinated by the feel of him. \u201cMine rejected me as absolutely.\u201d</p><p>The hunger to hold her strained at every one of his muscles, the butterfly flirtation of her touch fuel to his instincts. \u201cWhy?\u201d The cop in him said this was important, that it held the key to understanding her.</p><p>\u201cI was imperfect.\u201d Dropping her hand, she took a step back. \u201cWe should begin the drive to Nikita\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Imperfect. Anger burned a steel flame inside him, but he angled his head in acquiescence, not trusting himself to stop with a simple comforting touch\u2014not when he wanted to crush her to him, teach her that he saw her as anything but imperfect.</p><p>Neither of them spoke again until they were in the car and on the road. \u201cMy knowledge of Nikita is based on what I\u2019ve seen in the media,\u201d he said as they merged into the morning traffic. \u201cShe comes across as intelligent, a cut-throat businesswoman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Sophia felt her muscles relax at the realization that Max didn\u2019t intend to press her to take the next step in this unforeseen, unpredictable dance. The part of her that had been waiting for him for a broken, tormented eternity wanted to rush, to race, but the simple fact was, she didn\u2019t have the capacity to process anything more than what they\u2019d already done. Not yet. \u201cNikita also seems to be one of the few high-level Psy who thinks in truly global terms\u2014she is, as far as I know, the solitary Councilor who has such close ties with a changeling group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that Anthony Kyriakus is still subcontracting foreseeing work out to his daughter, Faith.\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded, having followed the news of Faith NightStar\u2019s defection. Foreseers were rumored to be even more mentally unstable than Js\u2014and yet Faith had survived. Though Sophia had always known that any such defection was out of the question for her, her mind woven inextricably into the fabric of the Net, Faith NightStar\u2019s survival had seemed a victory for all of them who were labeled mad and had their lives erased from existence.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said in response to Max\u2019s question. \u201cAnthony is also involved with the changelings, but according to my research, Nikita was the one who took the first step into such an arrangement when she formed a business alliance with DarkRiver\u2019s construction arm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max switched lanes, his brow furrowed in thought. \u201cCould be something there,\u201d he murmured, and she could almost hear his brain working, making connections with a speed that many Psy, certain of the superiority of their mental abilities, would find extraordinary. \u201cAny more details on the construction deals?\u201d</p><p>Forcing herself to look away from the clean lines of his profile, the sleek strands of black hair that glimmered with hidden red highlights in direct sunlight, Sophia checked her data. \u201cIt looks like her firm is gaining changeling housing contracts not only in the U.S., but also internationally. The murders may be motivated by professional rivalry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would fit.\u201d Max tapped a finger on the steering wheel. \u201cEach of the victims died on the verge of a major deal.\u201d</p> <p>Surprised, Sophia quickly skimmed through the relevant parts of the file and realized he was right. \u201cAll three were linchpins, bringing something unique to the table,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cTheir deaths derailed the entire process in each case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing obvious connects the three deals,\u201d Max said. \u201cWe need to find out if there\u2019s a link beneath the surface, if one particular competitor benefits with Nikita effectively out of the run\u2014\u201d A beeping interrupted his words. \u201cThat\u2019s my cell.\u201d He nodded at where it sat in the holder on the dash. \u201cCan you check the caller\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Picking it up, she glanced at the ID . . . and felt her mind go quiet, cold, the otherness stirring to life. \u201cIt is the prosecutor, Mr. Reuben.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>I can only show you what the defendant did in that room ten months ago.

And Sophia wasn\u2019t ready to have her brain crushed, her psyche, her personality, wiped from existence. Not when she\u2019d just found Max, found this man who made the cold, dark places fill with light. Clenching her fingers on her organizer, she fought past the whispers of vengeance that seemed to originate in the dark tendrils snaking through her mind and soothed the otherness back to sleep.</p> <p>\u201cBastard says he\u2019s got something to share, some memory he\u2019s apparently been able to dig up.\u201d Max braced his arm on the back of her seat, playing with a strand of her hair as he\u2019d done in the apartment.</p><p>She didn\u2019t pull away. They had trust between them now, a fragile thing born in the electrical storm of their first real touch. \u201cI suggest that this one time, we let him play his games.\u201d No matter her hunger to live, to steal and claw every extra day she could out of this life, she couldn\u2019t walk away from Bonner\u2019s evil. Not when the cost of protecting herself would be to abandon those lost girls, leave them buried and forgotten in the dark. No one should be forgotten. No one.</p><p>\u201cIf we play it right,\u201d she said, remembering three other young lives that had been willfully erased from every mind but her own, \u201cit\u2019ll only increase his frustration, make him more malleable.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes filled with raw, edgy emotions she\u2019d never get the chance to study, to truly know. Not in this lifetime. So she asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it\u2019s a pity torture is illegal.\u201d A visceral anger in every world. \u201cWe\u2019ll set up a comm-conference. We\u2019re not traipsing up to him so he can have a convenient memory lapse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe comm systems at our apartment won\u2019t have the necessary encryption.\u201d Sophia\u2019s own anger was a colder thing, a thing that saw nothing wrong in taking an eye for an eye, a life for a life. \u201cWe could ask Enforcement if they have a secure link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir system was pretty good last time I was here.\u201d Releasing her hair with a little tug that made her scalp prickle with sensation, the ice thawing in a flare of white-hot heat, he rubbed at his jaw. \u201cBut they have leaks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are leaks in every Enforcement building.\u201d Facilitated, in most cases, by the Psy.</p> <p>\u201cI think I know someone else who\u2019ll have a secure link.\u201d</p><p>So it was that half an hour later, Sophia was ushered into a small conference room in the medium-sized office building that was the DarkRiver leopard pack\u2019s city HQ. \u201cThey\u2019re not worried?\u201d she asked after their escort\u2014an auburn-haired young male\u2014withdrew from the conference room. \u201cThe changeling distrust of Psy is well-known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where the cats do business,\u201d Max replied, setting up the comm-conference using the touch pads. \u201cSome of that business is with Psy. And don\u2019t forget\u2014DarkRiver has several Psy defectors in its ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis building is full of changelings.\u201d The statement of the obvious slipped out.</p><p>Max turned to pin her to the spot with his eyes. \u201cAre you having trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tugged her gloves more securely over her wrists and snugly below the cuffs of her white shirt, the action more of . . . comfort, than necessity. \u201cChangelings are actually restful.\u201d</p><p>A raised eyebrow, those solid shoulders relaxing as he returned his attention to the comm controls. \u201cNot many people would describe them that way. They tend to have this wild energy below the human surface.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to point out that he burned with that same wild energy\u2014though in his case, it was contained so well, most people would never guess at it. All those women who wanted to own him, she thought, they didn\u2019t understand what it was they dared attempt to harness. But she knew. And she wondered what it would be like to stroke that sleekly muscular body with her bare hands.</p><p>He looked up, caught her watching him. \u201cWhen we\u2019re alone.\u201d A tease . . . and a warning.</p><p>Closing her hand over the arm of her chair, she jerked away her head. \u201cChangelings all have natural mental shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you tense enough to snap?\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to glance back at him, to watch him as he rechecked the encryption, lines of concentration across his brow. At that moment, the leash slipped free, the reins broke, and everything disappeared but the promise and the danger that was Detective Max Shannon\u2014she wanted to touch the skin exposed at his nape, wanted to know if it was soft or rough, wanted to strip off his shirt and rub her lips over the muscles that shifted beneath that honey-colored skin, wanted to stroke and know and possess. She simply wanted. \u201cChangelings like to touch.\u201d It came out soft, husky.</p><p>Max\u2019s shoulders grew tight, but he didn\u2019t turn. \u201cI asked Clay about that while you were in the bathroom just before. They don\u2019t presume skin privileges, so you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkin privileges.\u201d She tested the unfamiliar term, gleaning its meaning from the context. \u201cAnd you, Max?\u201d Thought translated into words so fast, she had no chance\u2014or will\u2014to hold them back. \u201cAre you easy with skin privileges?\u201d</p><p>Max moved to brace his hands on the back of her chair, leaning down until his lips threatened to brush the tip of her ear. \u201cIt depends on who\u2019s asking.\u201d The scent of him surrounded her as he placed his hands on the table on either side of her. A sensual trap. \u201cBut if you\u2019re talking about a certain J, well, for her, I might be very, very easy.\u201d</p><p>A tight kind of heat bloomed in Sophia\u2019s stomach, a strange fire that burned even the darkest, most secret part of her. \u201cMax.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she was asking for, her heartbeat an erratic tattoo against her ribs.</p><p>Max pushed off the table with a groan. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this here. It\u2019s almost time for the conference.\u201d A light touch on her shoulder, holding a protectiveness that shook her, disarmed her. \u201cYou ready, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>His voice, his presence, his willingness to be her shield . . . it shook her, but she nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d This had to be done\u2014those girls had to be brought home.</p><p>Even a Psy without any family of her own understood the importance of children, the ties of blood. To lose a child in the Net was to lose not only your immortality, but also your chance to gain the unqualified loyalty of at least one individual. Unless, of course, you were young enough to sire or carry other progeny.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s parents had been in their early thirties the summer she turned eight and everything fractured. They\u2019d gone on to have two more children\u2014both with each other. Their genes, after all, had already proved a complimentary set. Her siblings, too, were high-Gradient telepaths. Not as strong as her. But they weren\u2019t broken.</p><p>Bartholomew Reuben\u2019s face appeared onscreen at that moment, slicing away the heart pain of the past with the sadistic evil of the present. \u201cMax, Ms. Russo, good to see you. You\u2019ll be transferred to Bonner in a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou flew there, Bart?\u201d Max asked. \u201cWaste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m in another prison.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s lips curved in a humorless smile. \u201cBonner\u2019s not going to be pleased we didn\u2019t all start running when he said fetch.\u201d</p><p>A warning countdown appeared in the corner of the screen.</p><p>Ten.</p><p>Max snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly worried about pleasing the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Nine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be hooked into the comm-conference\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eight.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but Bonner will see only Ms. Russo.\u201d</p><p>Seven.</p><p>The scrape of a chair.</p><p>Six.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll move a little,\u201d Max said, \u201cmake sure I\u2019m out of the shot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Five.</p><p>\u201cYou good, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>Sophie. Tenderness in the way he said that name, making it something special between them, a gift.</p> <p>Four.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She held his gift tight to her heart.</p><p>Three.</p><p>\u201cInstant you want out\u2014\u201d</p><p>Two.</p> <p>\u201c\u2014say the word.\u201d</p><p>One.</p><p>Reuben\u2019s face disappeared, to be replaced by the gilded blond looks of a killer so vicious, the tabloids had fought to tell his story. He was a megastar in the shadowy underworld of serial-killer groupies, his \u201cauthorized biography\u201d read with religious fervor. She wondered how many of his fans realized the book was mostly fiction.</p><p>Bonner was incapable of truth.</p><p>\u201cMs. Russo.\u201d That charming smile, but there was an edge to it. \u201cI was so looking forward to seeing you in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have been an inefficient use of my time,\u201d she replied, keeping her hands loosely in her lap.</p> <p>\u201cBut how will you take my memories if you aren\u2019t nearby?\u201d A slow raising of his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my mind isn\u2019t cooperating with my need to share.\u201d Deep blue eyes filled with rueful laughter, the charming apology of a man who\u2019d done something a little naughty.</p><p>It would, Sophia thought, be so easy to kill him. She\u2019d just have to be in the general vicinity. Her telepathic reach was long enough\u2014she could make him suffocate himself with a pillow, maybe beat his skull against a wall until pieces of bone pierced his brain. The terror would make him mindless.</p><p>A tap on the table to her left.</p><p>Max. The reminder of the gift she\u2019d been handed, the gift she was determined not to lose, made her snap back to attention, the otherness retreating in the face of her resolve. \u201cThe prison officials stated that you\u2019d remembered a place we\u2019d be very interested to learn about.\u201d</p><p>Bonner displayed his teeth in a smile that could\u2019ve graced a toothpaste commercial. But his eyes. Reptilian eyes. She\u2019d seen eyes like that before\u2014on the powerful in the Net, men and women for whom the sanctity of life meant less than nothing.</p><p>The man who\u2019d done her last childhood evaluation\u2014making the final call on whether she was useful enough to be saved or should be put down\u2014had had eyes like the Butcher of Park Avenue. \u201cMr. Bonner?\u201d she prompted when the killer didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cThe memory seems to have faded away.\u201d A disappointed sigh. \u201cI know it had something to do with trees, but . . .\u201d Another shrug. \u201cMaybe if you came here, used your abilities to jog my recall . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems even this was a waste of time.\u201d Glancing to her left, she gave a curt nod. \u201cCut the connection.\u201d</p> <p>Bonner\u2019s face twisted to reveal the monster within for one violent second. \u201cMs. Russo, I don\u2019t think you realiz\u2014\u201d The empty slate of a blank screen.</p><p>\u201cI want to kill him with my bare hands,\u201d Max said in a voice so calm it made every single hair on the back of her neck rise in warning. \u201cIt\u2019s not a need for justice or anything pure. I want vengeance. I want him to suffer as those women\u2014those girls\u2014suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have the capacity to kill,\u201d Sophia said, telling herself to stop, but unable to keep quiet\u2014she needed to know what he thought of the broken part of her that knew only the most lethal kind of justice. If he was going to reject her, better that it be now, when she\u2019d only touched the wild heat of him once, when she\u2019d just begun to learn him . . . when she might survive the denunciation. \u201cThe lines are simply different for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes met hers, piercing in their intensity. \u201cAnd yours involve children. Sometimes women, but most often, children.\u201d</p><p>Sophia swallowed, uncertain how to answer, uncertain how to read his answer.</p><p>Bartholomew Reuben\u2019s face reappeared on the comm screen at that moment. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed. Never saw that ugly face of his until today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even at trial?\u201d Sophia asked, her confused terror translating into a rigid composure.</p><p>\u201cCool as a cucumber, that one,\u201d Reuben said. \u201cSmiled at the jurors, flirted with the gallery. If we hadn\u2019t had airtight evidence, he might well have charmed himself out of a conviction.\u201d A small pause. \u201cPlease be careful, Ms. Russo. Bonner is under constant supervision, but he does have rabid fans. If he manages to get out a message to one of them, you could be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Reuben.\u201d Sophia took the small, folded note Max passed her under the table. \u201cRight now, he needs me alive. He wants to awe me with his brilliance.\u201d After that . . .</p><p>Max felt his gut grow painfully tight as he thought back to the expression on Sophia\u2019s face before Bart signed off. He\u2019d known exactly what she was considering, his complex, dangerous J, knew, too, that he couldn\u2019t let her do it. But they were geographically far enough from Bonner right now that Sophia\u2019s tendency to hurt nasty people in creative ways was something he had time to deal with.</p><p>He knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Not when her actions\u2014and the crimes of those she\u2019d punished in that peculiarly J way\u2014all added up to a past that spoke of a brutal kind of hurt. Those scars, he thought, were invisible. But they were far more important than the thin lines that marked her face.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she muttered under her breath as they headed up to Nikita\u2019s office.</p><p>He knew why she was giving him that perplexed look\u2014and it soothed him to know the ploy had worked, drawing her back from the edge of the void. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t write me notes like that.\u201d It was a hissed order as the elevator doors opened on the correct level. \u201cWhat if someone had seen?\u201d</p><p>Max shot her an innocent look. \u201cI just asked a simple question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of boardroom sex?\u201d A raised eyebrow. \u201cThat is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since you asked,\u201d he interrupted, walking into the outer section of Nikita\u2019s office, \u201cI vote in favor.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, his entire being filled with the sensual delight that came from teasing Sophia, Max had no idea of the bloody consequences that would result from this meeting.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Some women are not meant to be mothers.</p><p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p><p>Councilor Nikita Duncan, he thought as they entered her private office, was a beautiful woman. If you liked beauty cut in ice. Perfect. Distant. Cold. According to public records, she was part Japanese, part Russian. That explained the combination of high cheekbones, almond-shaped eyes, above-average height. She\u2019d passed on the height to her daughter, but from the images Max had seen, Sascha\u2019s black hair curled rather than ran a slick dark rain, her skin a warm golden brown to Nikita\u2019s flawless ivory.</p><p>\u201cDetective Shannon, Ms. Russo.\u201d She gestured for them to take the chairs in front of her desk.</p><p>\u201cActually, Councilor,\u201d Max said, \u201cI think better on my feet.\u201d Walking to the huge plate-glass window that was the back wall of her office, he looked down into the active buzz of San Francisco and played a hunch. \u201cI need you to share the information you\u2019ve withheld.\u201d</p><p>He felt Sophia\u2019s eyes on his back, and had it been any other woman, he\u2019d have been prepared to get a royal reaming later on for springing this on her. But Sophia was unlike anyone he\u2019d ever before met. He had no idea how she\u2019d react\u2014and that both delighted him and frustrated him.</p><p>\u201cIt would,\u201d Nikita answered, \u201cbe illogical of me to conceal information when I\u2019m the one who requested this investigation.\u201d</p><p>Max turned enough that he could meet those cool brown eyes. \u201cThree deaths\u2014one car accident that you weren\u2019t sure was suspicious, one suicide that could\u2019ve been caused by mental illness, one heart attack\u2014that\u2019s not enough for you to pull in an outsider.\u201d A human.</p><p>Nikita stared at him, a lethal adversary for all that she wore a crisp skirt and shirt, her makeup professional, her hair perfect. \u201cIt\u2019s gratifying,\u201d she said into the silence, \u201cto know that you have the intelligence to get this task done.\u201d With that, she tapped something on her desk\u2014Max guessed she\u2019d activated some kind of an aural shield as a defense against high-tech spies. \u201cThere was an attempt on my life approximately four months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard rumors. Something to do with the Human Alliance?\u201d he said, referring to the most powerful human organization on the planet. On the surface, it was all about business, but word was, the Alliance had a strong paramilitary arm.</p><p>Nikita gave a regal nod in response to his question. \u201cThey placed an explosive device in the elevator I use to access this office and my penthouse, their apparent plan being to detonate the charge while I was inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey hooked into your surveillance system?\u201d Max asked, supremely conscious of Sophia\u2019s silent presence, though his eyes remained on Nikita.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nikita rose from her chair and, using a thin silver remote, activated a comm panel on what had appeared to be a blank wall.</p><p>The boy in Max was intrigued enough to have him walking over. \u201cThis isn\u2019t on the market yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI purchased a small company last year\u2014their engineers are brilliant, but it\u2019s the designers who have proven truly exceptional.\u201d</p><p>Another click in the back of his mind, another piece of the puzzle coming into view. \u201cA human company?\u201d He caught a hint of vanilla and lavender as Sophia moved to stand on Nikita\u2019s other side, and the scent was a slow stroke across his senses, a sensual reminder that his body had chosen this woman and had no intention of changing its mind.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nikita said. Then, using the command pad on the side of the screen, she brought up a three-dimensional model of the Duncan high-rise, drilling down until they were staring at a cross section of the relevant elevator shaft. \u201cAccess to this elevator is difficult but not impossible. However, access to the shaft itself is strictly controlled\u2014computronic security, twenty-four-hour surveillance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmergency hatch in the elevator?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cSounds an immediate alarm if it\u2019s so much as touched.\u201d</p><p>Max understood the import of her statement when she used a red X to mark the place where the charge had been laid.</p> <p>Above the elevator.</p><p>Mind beginning to hum with the exhilaration that came from knowing a case was starting to take shape, he tapped the screen, rotating the image until he could\u2019ve drawn it from memory. \u201cSomeone inside had to have either greased the wheels for the saboteurs or done the job himself.\u201d And the two, he thought, weren\u2019t necessarily connected. A smart man might\u2019ve become aware of the Alliance\u2019s plans, used them to further his own agenda. \u201cSurveillance footage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time I realized the significance of where the charge had been placed, that footage was gone, erased.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stirred, bringing up something on her organizer. \u201cThe list of those with the security clearance to successfully execute such an erasure is very short and includes every individual in your inner circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely, Ms. Russo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t seem to have the name of your security chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d Brisk words coated in frost. \u201cHe was killed in an accidental fall three weeks before the assassination attempt.\u201d</p><p>Max folded his arms, his gut tight. \u201cHe was the first victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve come to believe so.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked up from her organizer. \u201cYou haven\u2019t hired a replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I haven\u2019t found the right candidate. The assistant chief is doing an unobjectionable job at present.\u201d</p> <p>Max stared at the image of the Duncan building, but he wasn\u2019t really seeing it. There was dedication here, he thought, a long-term commitment that had to rise from a very specific motive\u2014and whatever that motive was, it was about more than the thrill of murder. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d he said to Nikita, \u201cthat you no longer trust anyone in your inner circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014\u201d She cut herself off as her phone began to beep. \u201cIt must be something critical. I ordered no interruptions.\u201d Picking up the handset, she said, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Max glanced at Sophia, caught by the way a sudden sliver of sunlight glimmered off the rich ebony silk of her hair. He could play with the soft strands for hours, intended to do exactly that once he\u2019d coaxed his J into bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t disturb anything. Don\u2019t enter.\u201d</p><p>Nikita\u2019s words had his attention whiplashing back to her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>She hung up. \u201cIt seems you will no longer have to satisfy yourself with cold case data. My international financial advisor, Edward Chan, has just been found dead.\u201d</p><p>This time, Max thought, there was no question of it being murder. Either the people behind the acts were getting impatient, or this was a message. \u201cSophia, you recording?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d clipped a small wireless camera over her ear, curving the lens in front of her left eye. \u201cGo.\u201d</p> <p>Having barred anyone else from entering, Max took his time looking over the scene, which happened to be on the second-highest floor of the Duncan building, right below Nikita\u2019s penthouse. The murdered man lay on the otherwise undisturbed bed, his legs hanging over the side. His pants were slate gray, his belt sedate black leather, his white shirt stained like a Rorschach painting in red.</p><p>\u201cNo bruises, no defensive marks on his hands.\u201d The only evidence of violence was the bowie knife thrust hilt deep in his sternum\u2014solid, thick, and Max guessed, with a wicked curved edge. The kind of knife you might use to bring down game or skin the pelt off a downed animal. \u201cLooks like a single blow, directly to the heart.\u201d</p><p>Sophia continued to film as they spoke. \u201cEither the victim allowed his attacker close, or the killer used Tk to punch the blade home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTk\u2014telekinesis?\u201d That would explain how the knife had ended up buried so deep\u2014though a burst of cold rage might well have sufficed to give the killer enough strength.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll go through the personnel files\u201d\u2014Sophia moved to his left, capturing images of the body from every angle\u2014\u201cfind out how many telekinetics the Councilor has in her organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikita said Chan got in from Cairo last night,\u201d Max murmured, \u201cbut that he had a number of informal meetings scheduled here in his home office this morning.\u201d Which meant someone had known his schedule well enough to time the murder when Chan would\u2019ve been alone and vulnerable.</p><p>As she shifted position again, the clean purity of Sophia\u2019s scent swept over him, providing a much-needed antidote to the ugliness of death. Psy, human, or changeling, Max thought, murder always had the same putrid stench. And the dead always screamed for the same justice. Edward Chan was one of Max\u2019s now, just like every single one of Bonner\u2019s lost victims.</p><p>\u201cIt was an individual he trusted,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way a telepath of his strength\u20148 on the Gradient\u2014could\u2019ve been taken by surprise.\u201d</p><p>Raising his gaze from Edward Chan\u2019s cold flesh, Max put his hands on his hips, pushing back his jacket. \u201cOne problem though\u2014even the most perfectly aimed stab wound wouldn\u2019t have caused death instantaneously and a telepath could get out an emergency message within seconds, if not less.\u201d Unlike with the Vale scene, everything here suggested a quick, brutal operation.

But the accusation was still very legible.</p><p>Traitor.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>The space for your father\u2019s name is blank in our records. Such an action is permitted in some limited circumstances, but the cause must always be noted. There is no such note on your file. We apologize for the error.</p><p>\u2014Office of Births and Deaths: City of New York,</p><p>to Max Shannon, June 2079</p><p>Nikita handed Max a data crystal as soon as they returned to her office. \u201cI\u2019ve downloaded the security footage for you\u2014it covers the period since Edward\u2019s return from Cairo.\u201d</p><p>Max slipped it into his pocket. \u201cAre private comm conversations backed up on your main servers? The killer dropped a corrosive acid in the computronic \u2018brain\u2019 of the system in the victim\u2019s room.\u201d And they\u2019d found neither a cell phone, nor an organizer.</p><p>\u201cEdward\u2019s entire file was wiped using his own security override,\u201d Nikita said, the words succinct. \u201cThe murderer must\u2019ve torn it from his mind.\u201d</p><p>The callous nature of it all might\u2019ve shocked other men, but Max knew that no matter the race, some were always born with a capacity for evil. \u201cWe thought we might have a pattern of deaths\u2014each of your other advisors was hit before a major deal. Does Chan fit?\u201d</p><p>Nikita was shaking her head before he finished speaking. \u201cEdward had a lot of things in play but nothing close to completion.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated at the sudden end to that line of inquiry, Max focused on another. \u201cSophia says the victim was high profile enough that he was known outside business circles?\u201d</p><p>A quick nod that sent her glossy hair swinging. \u201cIt was part of his job description to wine and dine human and changeling businessmen and women. As a result, he occasionally found himself in the society pages.\u201d</p><p>Max felt Sophia glance at him with those amazing, perceptive eyes, knew she\u2019d made the same cognitive leap he had. \u201cWould it be fair to say he\u2019d made some personal connections within those groups?\u201d</p><p>Nikita took a moment to think about it. \u201cNot in the human or changeling sense. However, certain individuals had come to have a measure of trust in him because of a shared history of successful deals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unquantifiable loss,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cOne that you will feel the effect of for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nikita looked at Sophia for a long, quiet moment before returning her attention to Max. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to see the pattern it appears you already have, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my next question won\u2019t come as a surprise\u2014who doesn\u2019t like you getting into bed with the other races?\u201d Edward Chan, Max was certain, had only been considered a traitor by association. It was Councilor Nikita Duncan who was the key.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Nikita said, \u201cis something I\u2019ll have to think about.\u201d</p><p>Sophia spoke into the small pause. \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors of a group called Pure Psy\u2014the members seem to believe that contact with the other races is tainting the purity of our Silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019ve begun to gain a measure of support in the Net.\u201d Nikita returned to her desk. \u201cI have some additional data on them that I\u2019m sending you now\u2014please brief the detective, Ms. Russo.\u201d</p><p>It was a dismissal from a woman who was used to obedience, but Max wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cWhoever\u2019s behind this, he or she is getting bolder\u2014they\u2019re going to come directly after you sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protected. That\u2019s why Edward and the others are dead\u2014the assassin went for the next best thing.\u201d A razor of a glance. \u201cYou\u2019d do well to protect yourself. You are, after all, only human.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia didn\u2019t say anything to Max until they were in the car heading out from the Duncan building. \u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing thought of as less because of your humanity?\u201d It bothered her a great deal. Max was worth far more than any other man she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>But he shook his head, his lips curved in a distinctly satisfied smile. \u201cNikita felt the need to point out my humanity because she\u2019s been forced into a position where she has to rely on a measly human. That has to bite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an irony, is it not?\u201d Sophia murmured, thinking of connections, of mothers and fathers. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most powerful people in the world, her net worth in the billions\u2014and yet she doesn\u2019t have a single person in her life whom she can trust not to thrust a knife into her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made her choices.\u201d Max had no sympathy for a woman who\u2019d disowned her child. He knew exactly how bad that had to have hurt Sascha.</p><p>When Sophia didn\u2019t say anything, he glanced at her. \u201cWhat about you, Sophie? Who do you trust?\u201d</p><p>Her answer rocked through him. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever told of my parents\u2019 rejection of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange, isn\u2019t it?\u201d His voice came out harsh, raw with emotion.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the two people Nikita chose to work this case are both people whose mothers threw them away.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence, not with the resources Nikita had at her disposal.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s organizer flashed at that moment. \u201cNikita\u2019s lab techs have done a first-look analysis of the forensic data\u2014the blood on the mirror was the victim\u2019s, the DNA and prints in the public areas belong to either Chan or Nikita\u2019s other employees, all of which can be explained by the meetings he held in his home office. No unexplained or suspicious DNA in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s answer was practical\u2014and said a thousand things. \u201cShe\u2019s a Councilor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Pulling to a stop in front of a small, bustling restaurant, he turned off the engine. \u201cIt\u2019s almost half past two. You can tell me about Pure Psy over lunch.\u201d From what he\u2019d heard so far, the group sat in diametric opposition to Nikita\u2019s growing business alliances with the other races\u2014but he needed to know more about their tactics to judge whether murder might be part of their arsenal.</p> <p>Sophia didn\u2019t move to step out of the car. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk being overheard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakeout it is, then.\u201d He wanted nothing more than to be alone with her, to take the next step in this strange courtship of theirs. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters little to me.\u201d</p><p>Max had already slid back his door, but now he paused and looked at her, realizing how far she\u2019d retreated within herself, her expression so remote he knew it was a front, meant to hide the vulnerable truth. \u201cDamn. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Every protective instinct he had, awakened to quiet, intense life. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Those night-violet eyes held a surprise that rubbed those same instincts very much the wrong way. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you need to think about.\u201d</p><p>That she\u2019d say that after the unspoken depth of this connection between them made him want to reach forward and tug her into a hard, hot kiss\u2014remind her of the truth in a way she couldn\u2019t ignore. But he couldn\u2019t touch her, not yet. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI do.\u201d Because slowly, inexorably, she was becoming his . . . to watch over, to know.</p><p>A wash of shadows in that stunning gaze, a silent indication that she\u2019d heard the message behind the words. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Such a polite statement hiding so much emotion. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said with a slow smile that made the polite mask slip, her expression flickering with suspicion, \u201cI intend to take my payment in kisses.\u201d</p> <p>Exiting the car to her sharply indrawn breath, he headed into the restaurant. The buzz of human and changeling energy surrounded him from every side\u2014voices rose and fell in animated conversation, the odd burst of laughter punctuating the hum. A woman brushed by him as she left, throwing him an apologetic glance over her shoulder. Another patron almost ran into him as he got off a stool around the island that surrounded the chefs in their open-air kitchen.</p><p>Ignoring what for him were distractions, but would for Sophia be a small slice of hell, Max placed his order using the built-in pad on the counter.</p><p>The waitress put the order in front of him less than five minutes later. \u201cYou look like a cop.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow as he scanned his debit card over the reader.</p><p>Laughing, she leaned forward, her cleavage displayed to cheerful advantage. \u201cWe get a lot in here\u2014there\u2019s an Enforcement station two blocks over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve developed excellent radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not from around here\u2014I can hear the accent.\u201d Taking something from her pocket, she slid it across the counter with a smile. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Picking it up when she turned to deliver another order, he saw that it was a small personal card made out of Japanese washi, bearing the name Keiko Nakamura and a cell phone code.</p><p>\u201cLucky man,\u201d a morose male said from his left. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get her to go out for a coffee for months.\u201d Envy was a thorny vine around every word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off the market.\u201d It had been true since the instant he first laid eyes on Sophia Russo, whether he\u2019d known it at the time or not.</p><p>A gleam of interest. \u201cCan I have the card then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Max dropped it into the takeout bag. \u201cKeep trying.\u201d</p><p>Keiko\u2019s rejected suitor scowled into his udon soup as Max walked away, his mind already on a woman with eyes full of secrets dark and painful. My Sophia, he thought, and it was a vow.</p><p>Sophia lifted the takeout containers from the bag as Max went to grab the plates from his kitchen area. When she saw the small white card, she assumed it held the number of the restaurant. Then her eye fell on the text. \u201cWho\u2019s Keiko Nakamura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Max walked out with the plates. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. It\u2019s going in the recycling.\u201d Putting down the plates on the table, he plucked the card out of her hand and placed it in the bin marked for the recycling chute.</p><p>But Sophia couldn\u2019t let the point go. \u201cYou met her at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Placing two glasses of water on the table, he pulled out a chair with a spare efficiency that struck her as quintessentially male. \u201cWaitress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a female gives her contact details to an otherwise unfamiliar man,\u201d she said, trying not to be distracted by the heated strength of him so close . . . so touchable, \u201cit is for private reasons.\u201d As with that woman in the elevator at Vale\u2019s apartment. \u201cWomen seem to always be giving you their cards.\u201d</p><p>Max opened one of the containers and served some sushi onto her plate using the disposable chopsticks. \u201cThat bother you, Sophie?\u201d A low, deep tone, a masculine smile that made her skin go tight with warning.</p><p>Remembering too late that Max Shannon was a cop used to digging deep, reading truths and lies, she opened the other container. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempura.\u201d Max put what appeared to be a battered prawn onto her plate, his voice holding a distinct male amusement. \u201cTry it. And you haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>Having removed her gloves and washed her hands earlier, she used her fingers to pick up a piece of sushi. \u201cI suppose I should become accustomed to women . . .\u201d She paused, unable to think of the correct term.</p><p>\u201cHitting on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I should get accustomed to women hitting on you,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, you are a beautiful man.\u201d</p><p>Color flagged Max\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll let you\u2014and only you\u2014get away with that. But never in public. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She was so fascinated by the disarming glimpse of embarrassment that she blurted out a need so deep, it would ravage her if he refused. \u201cI would rather you not respond to any such invitations while we are . . .\u201d</p><p>His gaze met hers, his attention so total that she felt as if she was in the sights of some great bird of prey. \u201cWhile we are?\u201d he prompted when she didn\u2019t continue.</p><p>She\u2019d come this far, couldn\u2019t go back now. He knew about the otherness, about the cold justice she\u2019d delivered to those who\u2019d hurt society\u2019s most vulnerable, and he hadn\u2019t turned away\u2014she was still too terrified to ask him why, but it gave her the courage to say, \u201cWhile we are learning each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearning each other,\u201d Max repeated, as if measuring the words. \u201cAnd will you let me in, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Something stirred deep within her, something that was at once dark . . . and lonely. Unutterably, absolutely lonely. \u201cBe with me, Max.\u201d Saying that was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done\u2014it felt akin to tearing out her heart and placing it at his feet . . . and hoping, just hoping, that he wouldn\u2019t crush it.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t say anything for several long moments. When he did speak, his voice seemed to have dropped an octave. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re asking, what I\u2019ll demand of you?\u201d</p><p>The tiny hairs on her arms stood up at the leashed intensity of the question. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Max picked up a piece of tempura, but instead of putting it on her plate, lifted it to her lips. His eyes held a silent challenge. And Sophia found her bone-deep vulnerability retreating under a wave of determination\u2014Detective Max Shannon was not going to disconcert her so easily. She parted her lips and took a bite. Eating the other half\u2014a shocking intimacy\u2014he returned his attention to her face. To her mouth. \u201cWon\u2019t whatever you experience spill out into the PsyNet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a risk, yes,\u201d Sophia admitted, feeling her lips turn dry, her throat seeming to swell. \u201cHowever, like all Js, my PsyNet shields are airtight, so the risk is acceptable. Even if there is a leak, any irregularities will be attributed to my disintegration as a functioning J, rather than to such a blatant breach of Silence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips thinned. \u201cAnd once those irregularities become too strong, you\u2019ll be taken away to be retuned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReconditioned,\u201d she corrected automatically. Part of her wanted to tell him the final truth\u2014that her chances had run out, that their relationship would accelerate her disintegration . . . and that she\u2019d choose a fugitive\u2019s death before allowing her personality to be erased, her memories of Max scrubbed away to leave her a hollow shell.</p><p>But if she shared that, he\u2019d never agree to her request, this man who looked at her as if she mattered, as if she was worth protecting. And she needed him to agree\u2014the hunger inside of her, it was so vast, so endless, so dark and cold, she didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d borne it this long. \u201cI\u2019ve survived reconditioning a number of times.\u201d When he didn\u2019t say anything, she rubbed her damp palms on her thighs. \u201cMax?\u201d</p> <p>Max heard the well-hidden tremor, the touch of vulnerability, and had to force himself to keep from soothing away her worry. Because that would be a lie. He was well and truly hooked on Sophia\u2014but no matter how easy he was with others, how laid-back, he\u2019d never be that way with this woman he was coming to consider his. No, with her, he might play\u2014would play\u2014but he\u2019d also push and demand and take. And she needed to understand that.</p><p>Making a decision, he stood and walked around to brace his hands on the table on either side of her, his breath stirring the tiny curls just above her ear. He saw her hands clench on her thighs, the scent of her a mix of vanilla, lavender, and something a little wilder, uniquely her own, a flower that had never known the hand of man. \u201cBe sure, Sophie.\u201d Today, this minute, he might possibly be capable of walking away. But if he touched her, if he claimed her . . . there\u2019d be no going back.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Sophia\u2019s answer was immediate. \u201cI am sure.\u201d</p><p>But he saw the strained angle of her jaw, the taut line of her body. \u201cAre you?\u201d When she remained stiff within the bracket of his arms, he drew in a deep breath . . . and let go of the reins. \u201cIf we do this today, if you accept me, then you take me as I am.\u201d He forced himself to give her one final chance, though the need to take her at her word, to finally taste the temptation that was Sophia Russo, was a pounding beat in every cell of his body. \u201cI won\u2019t be controllable, and I sure as hell won\u2019t do only what you ask of me.\u201d He brushed the shell of her ear with his lips.</p> <p>Sophia sucked in breath.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he murmured\u2014he\u2019d challenge, coax, seduce, but he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Never would he hurt her.</p><p>A jerky nod. \u201cBut I need space.\u201d She went as if to stand up.</p><p>He kept her in place by the simple expedient of remaining in position. \u201cLike I said, baby\u2014we do this, you\u2019ll have to let go, trust me.\u201d He let his lips stroke over the tip of her ear again, felt her tremble.</p><p>So sensitive, so exquisitely sensitive.</p><p>But no pushover.</p> <p>\u201cI may be fractured,\u201d she said in blunt response, \u201cbut I am not a submissive personality.\u201d</p><p>He felt his lips curve, delighted. \u201cDid I say I wanted a submissive? I just want to make sure you don\u2019t expect one either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how I see you?\u201d A husky question. \u201cAs a tiger who has decided to behave for the time being\u2014I\u2019m not stupid enough to attempt to leash you.\u201d</p><p>The maleness in him settled at the verbal stroking. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to make me come willingly to your hand,\u201d he murmured, pressing a single, gentle kiss to the sweet slope of her neck. \u201cAnytime you want.\u201d</p><p>A long, shuddering exhale, her skin shimmering with heat. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRide it,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t fight, just ride the wave.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shook her head. The impact of his touch\u2014hard, jagged, almost painful\u2014shoved through her. \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, she thought he wouldn\u2019t shift and she\u2019d drown in the avalanche of sensation, but then he rose to his full height, releasing her from the sensual prison of his arms. Pushing back her chair, she got up and stumbled to the bathroom. The cold water she splashed onto her face snapped some semblance of control back into her, but it still took several long minutes before she got herself under enough control to dare check her PsyNet shields.</p> <p>Holding\u2014a hard carapace that left her battered inside. Battered but protected. A strong PsyNet shield was a J\u2019s sole protection against early rehabilitation, and as such, was an unspoken secret in the Corps, the shield techniques passed on from J to J outside of any scheduled lesson. Even her boss, who played politics with cold-blooded ease, would never divulge that one truth. Because no one in the Corps was ever safe.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d Max\u2019s voice, shaping her name like a caress. \u201cEither you come out or I\u2019m coming in.\u201d</p><p>Tucking her hair behind her ears, she opened the door and walked toward the table. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d A lie. She was terrified he\u2019d decided against her, a woman who couldn\u2019t handle a simple kiss. \u201cIt was just a shock to my senses.\u201d</p><p>Max pulled out her chair. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sit, didn\u2019t dare go so close to the temptation and danger of him. \u201cI miscalculated how big the impact would be.\u201d How visceral. Her hands trembled as she went to pick up her discarded gloves. \u201cWe should work on the case.\u201d It was a jerky, unsophisticated attempt to change the subject.</p><p>Max smiled, and it felt as if he\u2019d stroked a fingertip across the most sensitive parts of her. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch the data files from the security cameras in the corridor outside Chan\u2019s apartment\u2014you can finish your lunch at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach felt tight, twisted into knots. \u201cI don\u2019t really need any more\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll eat.\u201d Cool words. \u201cYou\u2019ll need your energy.\u201d</p><p>Her negative response whispered away as she read the intent in those dark, dark eyes. \u201cYou still want to be with me? Even though I couldn\u2019t even handle . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure it just means you need more practice.\u201d</p><p>The provocative words turned the knots in her stomach into butterflies. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A slow, deep smile that revealed a lean dimple in his cheek. \u201cPractice will be fun\u2014I intend to be a very demanding coach.\u201d</p><p>She stared, wishing she could kiss her way down that dimple.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Smile widening and filling with a wickedly sensual heat, he turned to head to the comm screen in the living area. \u201cBring your plate.\u201d A coaxing glance over his shoulder as he inserted the crystal into the built-in player on the side of the screen. \u201cI promise to behave.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she believed him, but she couldn\u2019t resist. He stretched out an arm on the sofa behind her head as soon as she sat down. \u201cMax, you need to sit a little farther away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The dimple disappeared, but his expression remained warm . . . intimate. \u201cNo backward steps.\u201d He turned on the comm screen using the remote, even as his fingers began to play with strands of her hair.</p><p>For the first time, she found herself wondering what she\u2019d taken on.</p><p>A tug on her hair. \u201cFocus, J.\u201d</p><p>J. It had always been, if not a curse, then a symbol of the inevitable. But when Max said it . . . Her eyes lifted to the screen as it filled with a shot of the corridor leading to Edward Chan\u2019s room. As she watched, Max programmed the screen to skip to anything that disrupted the image of the empty corridor. The first time, it was a cleaning bot, buzzing its way industriously along the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he did it,\u201d Max murmured, his focus very much on the screen.</p><p>Sophia took the chance to watch him. His profile was all clean lines, his skin that strokable dark honey, his bone structure flawless. But Sophia had seen beautiful men before. Objectively speaking, Councilor Kaleb Krychek was one of the most devastatingly attractive men on the planet\u2014but the one time she\u2019d been in his vicinity, he\u2019d made her blood run cold. Max, on the other hand . . .</p><p>Her eyes went to the triangle of flesh bared at the open collar of his shirt. Other men sometimes had hair there, but she could see only smooth, unblemished skin. It made her want to ask him to unbutton the shirt farther so she could kiss her way across his chest, learn him with her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Sophia jerked her head to the woman onscreen. Dressed in a deep green pantsuit, she stepped out of the elevator and headed toward Chan\u2019s room, but entered the suite opposite his. Putting down her plate, Sophia reached for her organizer. \u201cThat has to be Marsha Langholm, Nikita\u2019s most senior advisor. She uses that apartment while in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to talk to her.\u201d Reaching over, Max took her organizer so he could read the notes she had on Langholm. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t like sushi, you should\u2019ve spoken up.\u201d</p><p>She ate another piece. \u201cI\u2019ve never tasted it before. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the tempura?\u201d He kept his eyes on the screen as it skipped to show a young male who slid an envelope beneath Chan\u2019s door before returning to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI recognize him\u2014Ryan Asquith,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s the same intern who later found the body. And tempura is quite . . . enjoyable.\u201d Never before had she considered food anything more than nourishment that kept her alive\u2014like most Psy, she\u2019d been conditioned against falling victim to the inherent sensuality of taste and pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try something else next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Marsha again.\u201d The woman walked over to Chan\u2019s with a briefcase in hand, exiting two minutes later to re-enter her own room.</p><p>\u201cQuick visit.\u201d He froze as the screen skipped forward and stopped on another individual. \u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked up. The female onscreen was tall, with black hair that spilled past her shoulders in soft curls, and skin that was dusted a golden brown. Unlike the others, she wasn\u2019t wearing a suit, but a shapeless coat in royal blue that swamped her frame. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But no matter the ill-fitting clothing, even Sophia knew who that was. \u201cI thought,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Sascha was estranged from Nikita?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are the business ties DarkRiver has with Nikita. But what was she doing on a private floor?\u201d He went silent as Sascha knocked on Marsha Langholm\u2019s door, was admitted.</p><p>The screen skipped forward.</p> <p>Two more men appeared a short time apart, neither of whom they could immediately identify. The first\u2014a slender black male who looked to be in his thirties\u2014spent approximately ten minutes with the victim before leaving. The second\u2014an aristocratic man with prematurely silver hair\u2014stayed five minutes longer than that before being shown out, and the victim was alive at that stage. They saw him step out into the corridor, walk his colleague to the elevator while they apparently finished up their conversation.</p><p>The next piece of movement showed Sascha exiting Marsha\u2019s apartment with the other woman by her side.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Max paused the screen, rewound it to the image of Edward Chan disappearing into his apartment. \u201cLook at the time stamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen fifteen a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resetting it to playback continuously from this point.\u201d But when he pushed Play, they saw Sascha leaving Marsha\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>Sophia blinked, staring at the time stamp. \u201cIt\u2019s over an hour and a half later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the looks of the file data,\u201d Max said, bringing it up on the side of the comm screen, \u201csomeone input a \u2018do not record\u2019 order for that period.\u201d He restarted playback.</p><p>The next movement came barely five minutes after Sascha\u2019s departure, when the same intern who\u2019d left the envelope returned\u2014eventually entering the apartment to discover Chan\u2019s body. \u201cWhy was Asquith given not only permission, but the code to override Chan\u2019s security?\u201d Max asked Sophia, stopping the playback.</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve gone into the Net to contact Edward, found him gone.\u201d Sophia had seen J minds blink out like that, known that death had claimed one more of her own. \u201cPsy who drop out of the Net without explanation are always tracked down to verify the reason for their disappearance.\u201d For Sophia, that reason would only ever be death, her mind too deeply integrated into the Net to survive any separation. \u201cHow long it takes depends on the circumstances, but here it was obviously very close to the time of the murder.\u201d</p><p>When Max didn\u2019t say anything in response to her statement, she glanced over to find him pinching the bridge of his nose in an uncharacteristic gesture of frustration. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>A low, hard word as he dropped his hand. \u201cI\u2019m about to piss off the few friends I have in this city.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia went to reach out, touch him. But Max thrust both hands through his hair and got up from the sofa before she could transform thought into action. Her fingers curled into the sofa cushions\u2014just as something walked across her feet. She jerked back in response, making Morpheus yowl. \u201cOh, my apologies, Morpheus.\u201d</p><p>The cat gave her a baleful glare before hopping up to sit on the sofa beside her.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to pet him,\u201d Max said distractedly, pulling out his cell phone. \u201cI\u2019ll give Clay a call, set up a meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Marsha Langholm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk to her after Sascha.\u201d</p><p>Morpheus put a clawed paw on Sophia\u2019s thigh, insistent. Taking the hint, she ran her fingers through his fur. It was far softer than she\u2019d imagined, the living warmth of him making the experience nothing akin to touching a faux-fur coat, as she\u2019d once done in a department store.</p><p>When Morpheus spread out over her thigh, eyes closed in feline bliss, she knew she\u2019d passed muster. However, her attention was no longer on the temperamental cat, but on his master. Max stood by the window, cell phone to his ear. He moved, she thought, with the same grace as the feline under her hand\u2014with a muscled ease that told her he was in full and total control of his body, his strength.</p><p>What would it be like to stroke him?</p> <p>He turned, met her eyes. She wondered what he saw, because his expression changed to a look she knew instinctively she\u2019d only ever see in a sexual context. Closing the phone, he walked over and brushed back her hair, stroking his finger along the very tip of her ear. \u201cSascha\u2019s at the city office.\u201d</p><p>It was the lightest of touches, but she shivered. \u201cThat is not an erotic zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Leaning down, he closed his teeth gently over the same spot.</p><p>And Sophia saw stars.</p><p>They were met at DarkRiver\u2019s city HQ by the leopard alpha himself. Lucas Hunter was obviously not pleased to find his mate in the crosshairs of an investigation, but he said nothing except, \u201cMax, Ms. Russo,\u201d before showing them up to the meeting room.</p><p>Entering, Sophia tried not to stare at the woman seated on the other side of the round table. But that proved impossible. The image on the screen hadn\u2019t done Sascha Duncan justice. Not only did she bear the startling night-sky eyes of a cardinal\u2014white stars on a sweep of black velvet\u2014she was beyond beautiful, her face holding a glow that didn\u2019t seem real.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sophia,\u201d Max said to Sascha, his fingers pressing lightly on Sophia\u2019s lower back.</p><p>Her clothing did nothing to mute the impact of his touch, the tiny hairs on her arms rising up in vivid response. \u201cMs. Duncan,\u201d she somehow managed to say.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Sascha.\u201d Glancing up, the cardinal Psy touched her fingers to Lucas\u2019s as her mate walked around to stand by her side, his hand on her shoulder. Something unseen passed between them, because the leopard alpha angled his head in a move that was very feline, before saying, \u201cTake a seat,\u201d and folding his own body into a chair beside his mate.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d Max pulled out a chair, taking his own after she\u2019d seated herself. \u201cI\u2019ll be upfront with you both,\u201d he said to the DarkRiver couple, one arm braced on the table. \u201cSascha, you were in the Duncan building this morning in the apartment across from an Edward Chan.\u201d</p><p>Lucas leaned back in his chair in a seemingly casual pose . . . except that his eyes weren\u2019t quite human\u2014Sophia could see an areola of gold around the green, as if the leopard was simply waiting for an excuse to get out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you getting at Max?\u201d A question that held a warning.</p><p>\u201cJust doing my job,\u201d Max said easily. So easily you could\u2019ve almost overlooked the fact that he was holding Lucas\u2019s gaze with unflinching confidence.</p><p>Dominance, she thought, it was all about dominance with males.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Sascha murmured, and Sophia saw the other woman\u2019s shoulder muscles shift in a way that meant she had, in all probability, placed her hand on her mate\u2019s thigh. An intimate gesture between male and female, one she knew Max would allow her . . . and not another woman, no matter who she was. Not now. A strange new thing unfurled inside of her, tight and hot and determined.</p><p>\u201cYes, I was there,\u201d Sascha said to Max, even as Sophia fought the urge to push herself, to stroke Max, feel his muscles bunch under her touch. \u201cI went to speak to Marsha Langholm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is\u201d\u2014Max\u2019s tone was gentler than Sophia had ever heard it\u2014\u201cEdward Chan was murdered in the room across from Langholm\u2019s while you were in there with her.\u201d</p><p>Sascha\u2019s eyes went wide, her distress open. \u201cOh, God. That explains it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>Lucas ran a soothing hand along Sascha\u2019s spine. \u201cShh, kitten. Don\u2019t let it stress you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay\u2014it was just the shock of it.\u201d Taking several deep breaths, she looked straight at them. \u201cHow much do you know about my abilities?\u201d</p><p>Max glanced at Sophia, and she took that as a cue to answer. \u201cThey say you can sense emotion, heal wounds of the heart. There are rumors you\u2019re an E, a designation that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it exists,\u201d Sascha said with a firmness at odds with the incredible warmth of her presence. \u201cI\u2019m an empath, not a particularly useful thing in the Net under Silence. But that doesn\u2019t matter\u2014only two things matter. One\u2014I couldn\u2019t murder anyone, not without it rebounding back on me. I\u2019d feel the impact of the victim\u2019s death, and I\u2019m fairly certain it would kill me. Nikita can verify that for you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia found herself believing Sascha. There was just something about the other woman that made her want to believe. If all Es motivated the same response, then it might go toward explaining why their designation had been buried\u2014they were a threat, because they inspired loyalty without the fear that was the Council\u2019s favorite weapon. \u201cYou said two reasons,\u201d she prompted in a tone that held genuine respect. \u201cWhat\u2019s the second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I felt him die.\u201d It was a whisper. \u201cIt was just before I left Marsha\u2019s room. I felt a wave of nausea, then everything went black\u2014I thought I was going to faint. But it passed within seconds, so I put it down to getting up too quickly from the sofa.\u201d She leaned into her mate\u2019s embrace\u2014Lucas\u2019s face was set in lines of savage protectiveness, but he held her with open tenderness. \u201cPoor Edward. He always worked so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSascha.\u201d Max\u2019s tone was oddly careful as he said, \u201cDid you see or hear anything that might help? I\u2019ve got a gap of ninety critical minutes in the security footage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Frown lines marred her brow. \u201cThe rooms are all soundproofed, and I was intent on my conversation with Marsha. We were together the whole time except when I got up to go to the bathroom.\u201d Those extraordinary eyes met Max\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m the last person who\u2019d hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>Max thrust a hand through his hair. \u201cLook,\u201d he said in the tone of a man who\u2019d made a decision. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time you know what\u2019s going on.\u201d A searing glance out of those near-black eyes. \u201cSophie, it might be better for you to leave the room.\u201d</p><p>She remained in her seat. Max tapped her foot with his in playful approval\u2014making her heart slam against her ribs, her fingers curl\u2014before turning his attention back to the other couple. \u201cSomeone\u2019s attempting to derail Nikita\u2019s organization by taking out her people because he or she can\u2019t get to Nikita herself. It\u2019s looking like the bombers four months ago only got to the elevator shaft because someone on the inside made sure they did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sascha\u2019s hand clenched into a fist on the table. \u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019ll facilitate another attempt on her life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother,\u201d Max said, \u201cis forearmed and very security conscious. That\u2019s why the killer has become frustrated, started to target those around her.\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cSascha, if you\u2019re still in contact with her, you\u2019re a prime target.\u201d</p><p>Lucas Hunter tangled his fingers with his mate\u2019s, his lethal anger turning into an intense, protective focus. \u201cSascha isn\u2019t Nikita\u2019s heir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s Nikita\u2019s daughter.\u201d Max shook his head, his jaw a stubborn line. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says about the Psy ability to cut off people without a thought\u2014if a Councilor\u2019s daughter is taken out, it will have an impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be Councilor Duncan\u2019s financial heir,\u201d Sophia said into the silence, \u201cbut you remain her genetic heir, the only one she has.\u201d And genetics were very, very important in the Net. Those of her race had no love, no hate, to tie them together, but they had blood. \u201cAs far as I know, she hasn\u2019t arranged for a second child or a surrogate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sascha whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve never understood why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pack will protect my mate,\u201d Lucas said to Max. \u201cThanks for the heads-up.\u201d</p><p>Max gave a wry smile. \u201cThanks for not ripping my face off before I could get a word out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a pretty face,\u201d the leopard alpha responded, a feline smile warming those feral green eyes, \u201cthe women in the office would probably string me up if I messed it up.\u201d</p><p>Sophia felt the tension level in the room drop even before Max\u2019s expression shifted to pure male amusement. \u201cI thought Dorian was considered the fairest of them all.\u201d</p><p>It was Sascha who replied. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Max\u201d\u2014a tight smile, as the empath fought her worry for her mother\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re giving him serious competition. I\u2019m certain I heard Zara say something about wanting to lick you up like strawberry ice cream.\u201d</p><p>Sophia decided this Zara person couldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near Max. Who tilted back his chair in that way he had and laughed. \u201cSince I\u2019ve already broken the rules, if either of you have any idea of who might want to go after Nikita, I\u2019d be happy to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us discuss it and get back to you.\u201d Squeezing his mate\u2019s shoulder, Lucas rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Max stood as well. \u201cClay knows where I\u2019m staying, and he\u2019s got my cell code.\u201d As the men shook hands, Sophia got up, taking one last look at the extraordinary daughter Councilor Nikita Duncan had borne. Sascha\u2019s head was bent, her smile having faded away to reveal a haunting worry.</p> <p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Max holding the door. Walking out beside him, she considered whether she\u2019d mourn her own parents when they died. No, she thought. They\u2019d erased her from their lives so cleanly that she\u2019d had to erase them from hers in order to survive. It had been hard, so hard to do that. She\u2019d written letters at first. She\u2019d begged.</p><p>Finally, a response had come . . . one that had made her parents\u2019 position clear with brutal precision\u2014she was no longer, it had stated, an \u201cacceptable genetic heir.\u201d</p><p>A wolf whistle pierced the air, slicing neatly through the pained numbness of her memories of the day she\u2019d realized her parents were never returning for her. The whistle originated from the mouth of a small woman with coffee-colored skin. \u201cI hear you\u2019re single, Cop.\u201d A blinding smile.</p><p>Max\u2019s responding smile revealed the lean dimple in his left cheek that Sophia wanted to kiss each time she saw it. \u201cYour intel is out of date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it\u2014I\u2019m going to die an old maid.\u201d Her face drooped. \u201cI shall now go drown myself in fantasies where three\u2014no four\u2014hot men await my every whim.\u201d</p><p>Sophia didn\u2019t say a word until they were back in the car. \u201cI\u2019m . . . glad that you no longer consider yourself single.\u201d It took considerable willpower to say that, to admit how much his commitment meant to her. No one had ever before chosen her. No one.</p><p>Reaching out with a deliberate slowness, Max brushed his knuckles over her cheek. The sensation was a hot whip over her skin. \u201cThe things I plan to do to you, Sophie,\u201d he whispered in a deep voice that made her toes curl. \u201cZara\u2019s fantasies have nothing on mine.\u201d</p> <p>Lucas waited until after Max and Sophia Russo had left to turn to his mate. Fighting the urge to just cuddle the worry out of her, he leaned back against the wall by the door and folded his arms. \u201cNow, kitten, how about telling me exactly what you were doing in the Duncan building?\u201d His heart had almost stopped beating when she\u2019d confessed her little field trip.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Sascha said in a voice that would\u2019ve normally made him calm down.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d He dropped his hands, moved to brace them on the tabletop. \u201cI thought we agreed you\u2019d stay out of the limelight while you\u2019re so vulnerable. And God, you went\u2014\u201d He grit his teeth, unable to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cNo one realized I was pregnant,\u201d Sascha said, rising to move around the table, \u201cnot even Marsha. She thought I\u2019d put on weight because of my unregimented existence.\u201d Her hand curved over his cheek. \u201cI needed to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He thought he knew, but he wanted to be certain after she\u2019d sucker punched him with this stunt. \u201cAnd sit.\u201d Pulling out a chair for her, he took one to her right.</p><p>Placing one hand on his thigh in that way she had, his mate took another deep breath. \u201cI wanted . . .\u201d Her voice shook, and he could no more stop from reaching out to kiss her, pet her, than he could stop breathing.</p><p>\u201cKitten, you know you can tell me anything, anything.\u201d Why had she felt the need to hide this? That was what had him so lost.</p><p>\u201cI planned to tell you as soon as I got back,\u201d she said at once, her fingers tightening on his thigh, \u201cbut you were so busy I thought I\u2019d wait till tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to tell me things like this before.\u201d The panther snarled in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t let me see Marsha on my own,\u201d she said, a stubborn angle to her jaw. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want you to worry\u2014you do so much of it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You\u2019re pregnant with our child\u2014I have the right to go nuts looking after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you for it.\u201d An affectionate wave of emotion down the mating bond tied them together on the level of the soul. \u201cBut this, I needed to do alone.\u201d</p><p>His panther caught the vulnerability beneath the steely will. Reaching out, he curved one hand behind her nape in a hold as protective as it was proprietary. \u201cI still haven\u2019t heard what you went to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarsha\u2019s been my mother\u2019s advisor since before Nikita became a Councilor, since before she had me.\u201d</p><p>The tenderness he felt for her made his soul hurt. \u201cYou went to ask her what Nikita was like during her pregnancy and when you were born.\u201d His mate was so scared she wouldn\u2019t be a good mother\u2014when everyone around her knew she\u2019d be an amazing one.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her eyes were almost starless when she looked up. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t make myself ask any of those questions. I guess part of me was afraid of what she would say\u2014that Nikita never loved me, not even when I was in her womb.\u201d</p><p>It tore him apart to see her hurting. \u201cKitten.\u201d</p><p>A reassuring squeeze of his thigh. \u201cIt hurts, but it won\u2019t ever break me again like it almost did once. Not when I can feel you loving me every moment of every day.\u201d Eyes shiny with emotion, she reached up to stroke her fingers through his hair. \u201cMostly, I think I need to hear the answers from Nikita herself.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shifted closer, so she could more easily pet him with those hands he adored. \u201cI\u2019ll call her, organize a meeting.\u201d He\u2019d dance with the devil himself if that was what it took to ensure his mate\u2019s happiness.</p><p>\u201cMarsha missed my pregnancy because she\u2019s so focused on work she\u2019s oblivious to anything else,\u201d she said, playing her fingers over his jaw and along his neck. \u201cNikita won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laid his hand over the curved mound of her stomach, knowing that if he pressed his ear to that same spot, he\u2019d be able to sense the heartbeat of their unborn child. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to keep it quiet this far, but I think unless you plan to stay in seclusion, the jig is up. Max knew you were pregnant the instant he looked at you.\u201d At five months along, she was gorgeously, radiantly beautiful\u2014any man with a working heart would realize she carried a life in her womb.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling me fat?\u201d</p><p>He caught the gleam of laughter in those stunning cardinal eyes and knew his Sascha was more than tough enough to handle the woman who\u2019d given birth to her. \u201cAccording to Dev should mind his own business Santos, I should be feeding you more.\u201d She\u2019d gained little extra weight through the pregnancy. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re eating enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, did you or did you not go out at three a.m. to get me a pizza with all the fixings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say thank you for that yet?\u201d He leaned forward to speak with his lips against her ear.</p><p>Making a small, pleased sound, she nuzzled into his neck. \u201cI seem to remember you purring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though all I got was a single measly slice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rest my case.\u201d A kiss pressed to the beat of his pulse.</p><p>\u201cI eat like the proverbial horse.\u201d Sascha patted her hand over the one Lucas had placed on her abdomen. \u201cWe\u2019re both doing more than fine according to the doctor and Tamsyn.\u201d The DarkRiver healer had examined her only yesterday.</p><p>A shift inside her, a strange, beautiful thing, then a tiny foot slamming into her with a strength that surely came from the baby\u2019s father. \u201cOof.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas beamed with pride. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>Sascha made a face. \u201cWhy are you so convinced it\u2019s a girl?\u201d They\u2019d made the decision not to ask the doctor or healer to confirm gender, though Sascha couldn\u2019t help but know\u2014her baby\u2019s mind was developing day by day, becoming a stronger and stronger psychic warmth inside of her. Still, she liked to play with Lucas. He\u2019d ordered her not to tell him.</p><p>\u201cI just know.\u201d Bending his head, he pressed a kiss to the top of her abdomen, much as he had a habit of doing late at night, saying good night to their babe.</p> <p>She ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cI love you so much, Lucas.\u201d Her eyes teared, her voice got thick.</p><p>\u201cHey now.\u201d Raising his head, he touched his forehead to hers. \u201cPregnancy hormones strike again?\u201d</p><p>A jerky nod as she melted into his embrace. \u201cI should\u2019ve told you about visiting Marsha, but I swear I wasn\u2019t in any danger.\u201d</p><p>Lucas went predator-still. \u201cWho went with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you if you\u2019re going to go snarl at them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m their alpha\u2014they should\u2019ve told me.\u201d</p><p>She thumped a fist against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m their alpha\u2019s mate.\u201d</p><p>And, Lucas thought, she\u2019d earned her packmates\u2019 loyalty in her own right. \u201cDorian,\u201d he said, knowing the sentinel had a mile-wide soft spot for Sascha. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he on Max\u2019s surveillance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was less than thirty seconds away, in the emergency stairwell, monitoring the corridor with his superduper high-tech gee-whizz surveillance equipment, while I had the meeting. He even had me wired in case Martha suddenly went insane and tried to kill me by throwing her organizer at my head.\u201d A theatrical gasp.</p><p>Lucas nipped her lower lip in punishment for the smartaleck response\u2014and because he was proud of his mate\u2019s strength, no matter that he hadn\u2019t gotten his own way. \u201cCome on then, let\u2019s go see what Blondie has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, did you notice?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax and his J.\u201d</p><p>Lucas leaned one arm against the table, scowling. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophia Russo\u2019s almost impossibly good at hiding her disintegration,\u201d Sascha said. \u201cI only picked it up because of my empathy. So much pain, so much.\u201d She closed her hand into a fist, rubbed it over her heart. \u201cI wanted to reach across and tell her it was alright, that she was safe, that we\u2019d help her.\u201d</p><p>Lucas was used to his mate\u2019s empathic nature. But he was also an alpha, pledged to protect his people. \u201cShe\u2019s in the Net, Sascha. No way to know if she can be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d A stubborn look. \u201cAnd if she decides to call me one day, I won\u2019t say no to any request she makes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you this hardheaded when I mated with you?\u201d A growl formed low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cNo. I think I\u2019m maturing with age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, stop it.\u201d In spite of his teasing words, her responses, he caught the edge of fear in her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, kitten. The cop knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Max Shannon, Lucas thought, might appear nonthreatening with that easy smile of his, but it was deceptive\u2014the cat had sensed the truth, sensed the hunter that lurked beneath the human skin. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop until he brings down his prey.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>No one ever expects betrayal. No one.</p><p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p><p>Making it back to the Duncan building by five, Max and Sophia managed to round up the other four people who\u2019d appeared on the surveillance footage.</p><p>The intern, Ryan Asquith, was unable to provide any useful information, but Marsha Langholm was far more forthcoming. \u201cDetective,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point. While I did see Edward for a brief period this morning so he could sign a contract, I was in a private meeting at the time of his murder, and I\u2019d rather not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Max held up a hand. \u201cSascha told us she was with you.\u201d</p><p>A slight nod. \u201cIn that case, you\u2019ll understand the need for discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Councilor wasn\u2019t aware Sascha was in the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no way of knowing that.\u201d</p><p>An artful dodge, but Langholm\u2019s loyalty to the Duncans\u2014even to the extent of protecting one who had defected\u2014was clear. \u201cYou\u2019re one of Nikita\u2019s highest-ranking people,\u201d Max said. \u201cIs there anything you can tell us that might help with tracking down the person or people behind these murders?\u201d</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t pretend not to understand. \u201cI knew Vale didn\u2019t commit suicide\u2014it was simply not in his psychological profile.\u201d A pause. \u201cI can\u2019t give you names or any concrete details, but there have been ongoing . . . ripples from Sascha\u2019s defection.\u201d</p><p>Tapping Max\u2019s foot beneath the table in a silent signal, Sophia put down her organizer. \u201cSurely no one holds the Councilor responsible for her daughter\u2019s so-called flaw? In any case, I thought it was common knowledge that Nikita severed all familial ties with Sascha.\u201d</p><p>Marsha responded directly to Sophia. \u201cThere were questions after Sascha left the Net, but they calmed once it became clear the Councilor was going about her business as normal. Eventually, Nikita\u2019s business association with the changelings began to be considered an asset because they are an unusually difficult market to capture.\u201d</p><p>Max sat back\u2014it was clear Sophia knew precisely the right questions to ask. But he couldn\u2019t resist tapping at her foot in playful response. She put the high heel of her pump over the front of his leather shoe in silent reproof.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d In sharp contrast to her foot, Sophia\u2019s fingers lay unmoving on the glass-topped table.</p><p>He remembered those same fingers weaving through Morpheus\u2019s fur, remembered, too, the expression of discovery on her face, as if she\u2019d never before petted a living creature. He wanted to share a thousand other pieces of his world with her\u2014but to do so, he\u2019d have to plumb her secrets, discover everything the Justice Corps kept hidden. Because he wasn\u2019t letting this J disappear into the dark.</p><p>\u201cThe Councilor hasn\u2019t changed her business practices.\u201d Marsha Langholm\u2019s voice broke into his thoughts. \u201cHowever, there have been certain subtle changes in the PsyNet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe political winds are shifting,\u201d Sophia murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marsha Langholm said to Max\u2019s surprise. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a split. The lines are very, very fine, but the division is starting to take form. Nikita stands on one side, those who support Pure Psy on the other.\u201d</p><p>Max decided to reenter the conversation. \u201cExplain Pure Psy to me.\u201d Sophia had told him what she knew about the group\u2014including the extra intelligence Nikita had sent her, but this was an opportunity to get the perspective of another powerful Psy.</p><p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t have heard of it,\u201d Marsha said, and it was\u2014no doubt about it\u2014condescending. \u201cPure Psy\u2019s guiding aim is to strengthen and preserve the integrity of Silence, a concept they term Purity. They\u2019ve come to believe that contact with the other races is contaminating us\u2014and that that contamination is a direct cause of the rise in defections and whispers of rebellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Nikita is considered a problem\u2014because of her increasingly strong ties with the changelings.\u201d Sophia\u2019s tone was as pragmatic as Marsha\u2019s. \u201cHow about other businesses? Are they pulling back from their non-Psy connections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome are considering it\u2014while Nikita has recently entered into another construction deal in partnership with DarkRiver and SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it is Pure Psy,\u201d Max said, telling himself to behave when he got the urge to ruffle Sophia, sneak under that prim composure of hers by tap-dancing his fingers along her thigh, \u201cwhy single out Nikita? She\u2019s one of seven Councilors.\u201d</p><p>Marsha Langholm touched the screen of her organizer where it lay on the table in front of her, not a restless motion\u2014fully conditioned Psy never made those\u2014but an indication. \u201cI looked you up, Detective Shannon. For a man with such a high solve rate, you\u2019re a rare presence in the news media.\u201d</p><p>Max shrugged, let it rest at that.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me willing to share this information. I\u2019ve heard murmurs that Henry Scott has aligned himself fully with Pure Psy, and that Shoshanna, as his wife, is aligned with him.\u201d</p><p>Max made a mental note to ask Sophie how that worked\u2014the Scotts couldn\u2019t truly be husband and wife, not in the emotional sense. \u201cThat still leaves Anthony Kyriakus, Tatiana Rika-Smythe, Ming LeBon, and Kaleb Krychek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll four have undeclared political loyalties,\u201d Marsha Langholm said. \u201cPure Psy might be suspicious that Anthony doesn\u2019t stand on their side of the line, but then again, his action in subcontracting foreseeing work to his daughter is an understandable business decision, given Faith NightStar\u2019s sheer value. And, the NightStar clan has little contact with changelings beyond that subcontracting arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Sophia spoke again, her voice a stroke against Max\u2019s senses. \u201cDo you have any idea where the other Councilors might stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTatiana Rika-Smythe recently bought significant amounts of shares in human companies. If she continues on that track, it will by default put her on the other side of the line from Pure Psy. Ming LeBon and Kaleb Krychek are unknowns. They\u2019ve done nothing that could be considered either for or against the group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get one thing,\u201d Max said, tipping back his chair. \u201cPsy are all about logic, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Pure Psy makes no rational sense.\u201d A pointed tap on his foot. Hiding his grin, he put his chair back down on all four legs. \u201cIf they succeed, they\u2019ll isolate the Psy, cut off huge sources of revenue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marsha Langholm didn\u2019t answer. Sophia did. \u201cIt is logical, in a way,\u201d she said. \u201cPure Psy believes that if the Net is \u2018closed\u2019 again, then Psy power will grow to the extent that our race will eventually be able to exterminate the changelings and humans both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if such an act means a loss of power\u2014of personnel,\u201d Marsha Langholm added, \u201cin the short term.\u201d</p><p>It was the most cold-blooded description of murder Max had ever heard.</p> <p>Dorian looked up from the computer where he was doing something that disappeared the instant Sascha and Lucas walked into the second subbasement of the DarkRiver building.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Sascha whispered to her co-conspirator.</p><p>Dorian grinned at Lucas. \u201cSo how mad are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have a mate, I\u2019d consider making you a eunuch,\u201d Lucas said, watching Sascha walk over to stand on Dorian\u2019s other side, her hand on the back of the sentinel\u2019s chair.</p><p>Turning, Dorian angled his head, asking for permission. When Sascha smiled, he pressed his ear against her belly, touching his hand protectively to the swell. If any man outside the pack had dared to do that, Lucas would\u2019ve torn him to shreds with his bare claws. But this was Dorian, Sascha\u2019s favorite sentinel, and one of the best friends Lucas had ever had.</p> <p>His panther sat up in inquisitive interest when Sascha laughed at something Dorian whispered to the baby. \u201cHey,\u201d the sentinel said in a louder tone, \u201cyou never know. Kid could come out wanting to know all about advanced martial arts.\u201d</p><p>Sascha messed up the sentinel\u2019s distinctive white-blond hair. \u201cAccording to Vaughn, she\u2019s going to be a painter, he\u2019s sure of it. According to Clay, he\u2019s going to be a sentinel-born. According to Hawke\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas growled at the wolf alpha\u2019s name.</p><p>Laughing, Sascha continued. \u201cAccording to Hawke, her purpose in life is going to be to make Lucas insane. He\u2019s already bought Lucas a woolen hat\u2014for when he tears his hair out,\u201d she explained at Dorian\u2019s confused look.</p><p>Lucas felt his lips tug upward at her gentle teasing. \u201cYou know what I can\u2019t wait for? That wolf to get his comeuppance. I\u2019m going to throw a party when he gets mated\u2014then take a front-row seat while his mate makes mincemeat out of him.\u201d</p><p>Sascha\u2019s expression softened, and Lucas could guess the direction of her thoughts. Accepted knowledge said the wolf alpha would never mate, but things had shifted in the past year. It was beginning to look as if there might be a chance for the SnowDancer. And no matter how much they antagonized each other, Lucas would never wish anything but good luck to the other male on this one point. Because when it came to mating . . .</p> <p>His eyes met those of the cardinal Psy who was his mate, his heartbeat. \u201cStop flirting with Dorian and come over here.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand, she moved to fit herself against his side. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare flirt with Dorian. Ashaya would turn me into chopped liver.\u201d</p><p>Dorian gave a smug grin. \u201cMy mate thinks I\u2019m the most gorgeous leopard she ever saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow us the footage before your head explodes,\u201d Lucas muttered, but his own cat was grinning to see Dorian so happy. The sentinel had been latent most of his life, unable to shift into leopard form. Now that he could, he did so at every opportunity. \u201cHave you managed to catch a rabbit yet?\u201d</p><p>A single eloquent finger. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Lucas snickered. \u201cWhat about trying for a turtle?\u201d</p><p>Dorian lunged out of the chair and went for Lucas\u2019s throat.</p><p>Laughing, Sascha watched the two men fall to the floor. Neither had released claws, and it was obvious they weren\u2019t doing anything much more than wrestling. Men, she thought with a fond shake of her head, turning to take Dorian\u2019s chair.</p> <p>Oooh, that felt so much better.</p><p>Though her energy levels had increased over the past week or two, her ankles were persisting in their attempts to turn into miniature logs. A little bump in her stomach, a reminder that it was all worth it. Yes, she thought to her child, you\u2019re worth everything.</p><p>A sense of happiness, warmth, belonging.</p><p>She stroked her hand over her belly, keeping one eye on the two boys still rolling around on the floor. You\u2019re incredibly loved, my sweet baby. The entire pack was waiting for the birth, as they did for every birth in DarkRiver. Each child was treasured, celebrated.</p><p>None would ever be rejected as flawed.</p><p>Smiling, she tapped the screen to bring up the correct files. Dorian hadn\u2019t actually listened in on her conversation with Marsha\u2014instead, he\u2019d monitored the tone of her voice with one of his gadgets, ready to break down the door the instant it indicated distress. However, he\u2019d also kept an ear on what went on in the corridor, recording it as a matter of course.</p><p>Something thumped behind her as she opened the file. \u201cDorian?\u201d she said. \u201cIs this audio only?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014umfh!\u201d Another thump. \u201cYeah. Haven\u2019t had a chance to\u2014\u201d</p><p>A loud crash.</p><p>Trying to keep a stern face, she turned. \u201cIf you mess up this lab, I\u2019ll rat you out to Ria.\u201d Lucas\u2019s administrative assistant had ordered all the hard-to-find equipment Dorian had specified, helped put the place in order to the last rivet and bolt.</p><p>Lucas lifted up his face, his hair messy and so gorgeous, she wanted to tumble him to the floor herself. \u201cAw, come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dorian muttered, pushing himself up into a sitting position, his T-shirt rucked up to bare part of his muscled abdomen. \u201cThat\u2019s just mean, siccing Ria on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s five feet and zero inches,\u201d Sascha said, noting that between them, Lucas and Dorian probably outweighed and out-muscled Ria four times over. \u201cWhy are you all so scared of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know \u2019cause she likes you.\u201d Getting up, Lucas held his hand down to Dorian, who took it and bounced up to his feet.</p><p>Neither looked anything but a little rumpled. Cute, she thought, they looked cute. And they\u2019d snarl if she even dared utter the word. \u201cI\u2019d like to listen to this audio now.\u201d Her joy dimmed. \u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to hurt my mother.\u201d</p><p>Lucas squeezed the back of her neck in silent reassurance, his love a protective shield around her. When Dorian queried her words, Lucas gave him a short pr\u00e9cis of events\u2014the sentinel touched his fingers to her cheek before turning to fix something in the audio file. \u201cI was monitoring the live feed the whole time and heard nothing suspicious, but I was only listening out for threats to Sascha. Here we go.\u201d</p><p>There was a whole lot of nothing, and more nothing on the tape.</p><p>\u201cNew plan,\u201d Dorian said after several minutes, \u201cI\u2019m going to skip to any incidents where the noise level went over the baseline.\u201d</p><p>There were several noises that made the computer stop, people coming and going. Then, a bare few minutes before Sascha left Marsha\u2019s apartment, the sound of footsteps, a knock, a door being opened.</p><p>\u201cI see you received my message,\u201d said a male voice, with a slight French accent. \u201cCome in. The papers are sitting on the coffee table where you left them earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck,\u201d Lucas muttered, thrusting a hand through already tousled hair. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I think it is, Max is going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Like the majority of telepaths born with the J facility, this female has a minor ability in the F spectrum, limited to the potential for backsight. Her ability measures at 1.5 on the Gradient and may never activate.</p><p>\u2014PsyMed report on Sophia Russo, minor, age 8</p><p>Max wasn\u2019t pissed when Lucas called him. He was beyond pissed. \u201cDamn it, Luc. You should\u2019ve told me this when we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s evidence you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have,\u201d the DarkRiver alpha said as Sophia got up and closed the door to the interview room, ensuring privacy. \u201cAnd for the record, I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve already snarled at the two culprits for you.\u201d</p><p>Recognizing the peace offering for what it was, Max blew out his breath. \u201cCan you send the segment through to my phone? I\u2019ll pick up the original later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Dorian to do it. And, Cop\u201d\u2014his voice dropped\u2014\u201cyou need us, we\u2019re there. Don\u2019t hesitate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d Closing the phone, Max told Sophia what the DarkRiver alpha had shared.</p><p>Sophia tucked her hair behind her ear, baring the marks on her face, marks that were becoming intimately familiar to Max. \u201cThey take the protection of their mates seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s only changelings who do that?\u201d Max raised a hand, waited until she leaned a wary fraction toward him. Then, his eyes on the sweet curve of her lips, he danced his fingers over her temple, the edge of her cheek, and along her jaw.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s heart was a stampede in her chest, her skin prickling with a near-painful heat, but she didn\u2019t move away. And when Max stepped even closer, until her breasts brushed his chest with every breath, she found her free hand rising to press against the warm resilience of his pectorals.</p><p>\u201cI want skin,\u201d she dared confess, though she wasn\u2019t certain she\u2019d survive the sensual impact.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Max bent his head, his breath hot against her cheek as he stroked his lips over her skin in a slow, sweet glide, his hand closing over her hip in a grip so proprietary, it felt akin to a brand.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Her legs trembled with the effort to stay in place, to soak in the feel of him\u2014hard and strong, an erotic temptation.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Max stepped back. \u201cNext time, I get your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Gripping the back of a chair, she swallowed, tried to find her voice. It was gone, lost in the rush of thunder that was her bloodstream. Her eyes met Max\u2019s again, and she saw the glitter in his gaze, saw, too, the skin pulled tight over his jaw. \u201cIt can\u2019t affect you like it does me,\u201d she finally managed to say, her throat raw. \u201cYou must be used to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo another man would work just as well for you?\u201d</p><p>The answer spilled out of her. \u201cOnly you.\u201d A dangerous confession, but Sophia didn\u2019t have time to play games. Bitterness threatened to rise in a sharp, acidic burst, but she crushed it, determined not to give in to useless anger. \u201cOnly ever you.\u201d</p><p>Max sucked in a breath, swearing low in his throat. \u201cGood\u2014because I sure as hell am not the sharing kind.\u201d With that harsh statement of claim\u2014and she understood that that was exactly what it was\u2014he turned to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second.\u201d</p><p>Max leaned against the wall outside the meeting room, his breath coming in jagged gulps. The cool air did little to clear the scent of Sophia from his lungs. She was nothing he\u2019d ever expected, everything he wanted.</p> <p>And she was Psy.</p><p>Just now, when he\u2019d touched her, when she\u2019d touched him, her eyes had drowned in black. No iris, no pupil, no whites, nothing but an endless spread of black. It had shaken him, not because he was afraid\u2014but because it was a reminder of the gulf between them. He\u2019d seen the PsyNet in her eyes, a vast emptiness that he could never enter, and she could never leave.</p><p>Sascha Duncan did, his mind whispered.</p><p>The elevator doors opened on the heels of that thought, disgorging Quentin Gareth, one of the two men Max and Sophia hadn\u2019t been able to initially identify on the security footage.</p><p>\u201cDetective Shannon.\u201d The male\u2019s prematurely silver hair glinted under the overhead lights. \u201cI was told you had questions for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for coming.\u201d Pushing off the wall, he opened the door to find Sophia sitting in a chair on the other side of the table.</p><p>The distance did nothing to eliminate the thrumming tension between them, so thick and hotly sexual that Max wondered how Gareth could miss it.</p><p>\u201cDetective,\u201d the man said as soon as they were seated, \u201cif this could be as fast as possible, I\u2019d appreciate it. I\u2019m scheduled to catch an airjet to Dubai.\u201d</p><p>Max was aware of Gareth\u2019s travel plans, but unlike with human criminals, Psy\u2014especially Psy this high up in the power structure\u2014were far less of a flight risk. Nikita could track Quentin Gareth across the PsyNet if it came down to it. \u201cHow about you just run us through your meeting with the victim,\u201d he said in a tone he kept casual. Maybe Psy didn\u2019t feel, but from what he\u2019d seen, they were very, very good at reading and manipulating those who did.</p><p>\u201cOur meeting was prearranged, but Edward reconfirmed once he returned from Cairo. The meeting covered a number of general ideas for expansion\u2014we wanted to talk before I got caught up with the Dubai negotiations and he with his own projects.\u201d</p><p>Responding to Max\u2019s questions, Gareth told them he knew of no reason why anyone would\u2019ve targeted Edward Chan. Max ended the interview on that point. \u201cWe need deep background checks on all four possibles,\u201d he said to Sophia after Gareth left. \u201cMy gut says Marsha is clean, but she could have a skeleton in her closet that leaves her open to blackmail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m already working on it.\u201d Her voice was husky, a rough caress, a reminder of the sensual fever that had almost consumed them earlier. \u201cI have contacts in Justice who can do it under the radar.\u201d</p><p>Max clenched his hand on the arm of his chair. \u201cYou know,\u201d he murmured, needing to release the tension in some way, \u201cI think this table is strong enough to take your weight. You never did tell me what you thought of boardroom sex.\u201d</p><p>She jerked up her head, a slight flush on her cheeks. But she didn\u2019t back down. \u201cI think we\u2019d need a stronger lock on the door\u2014and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d enjoy being pounded against a hard surface.\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cpounded\u201d acted like an aphrodisiac, sending his good intentions all to hell. \u201cThen you can ride me,\u201d he said, his cock a steel rod in his pants. \u201cThe view\u201d\u2014he ran his gaze over her breasts\u2014\u201cwould make me more than happy to be pounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d Sophia said in a very tight voice, \u201cif you don\u2019t behave, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was probably for the best that Andre Tulane, the final individual on the surveillance footage, arrived then. He gave them the same basic story as Quentin Gareth.</p><p>\u201cAny one of them could\u2019ve done it,\u201d Max said after the man left, \u201ceven Marsha. All she\u2019d have needed was a couple of minutes while Sascha went to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s responding words were practical . . . even if her voice continued to rub across his skin in sweet, hot strokes. \u201cMaybe. But according to my recollection of the interview with Sascha, they were together when she felt Edward die.\u201d</p> <p>Max frowned, thought back. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll confirm with Sascha in any case.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Sophia said, \u201cWe should listen to the audio made by DarkRiver.\u201d</p><p>Taking out his cell phone, Max played the file. \u201cEdward Chan\u2019s bio said he grew up in France\u201d\u2014a sharpening of interest, the first scent of their prey\u2014\u201cso that\u2019s got to be him. Which means Chan welcomed someone back into his apartment just prior to his death. The time stamp on this file fits the time line perfectly.\u201d Getting up, he walked to lean back against the table beside Sophia, unable to resist running his finger down her arm. \u201cThe wording tends to clear Ryan Asquith, even if he is a telekinetic.\u201d</p><p>She shivered but didn\u2019t pull away, her hand dangerously close to his thigh. He wanted her to raise it, place it on him, go higher. Smothering a goan at the erotic image, he focused on her mouth instead. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, her lips soft and lush, \u201cAsquith only went inside the apartment at the end. But by the same token, he is the newest, least known member of Nikita\u2019s staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d\u2014his own voice was sandpaper rough\u2014\u201cbut he wasn\u2019t working for her when the elevator charge was laid.\u201d Remembering the note he\u2019d written while she\u2019d been out of the room earlier, he took it out of his pocket and dropped it into her bag, making certain to just barely brush the back of her hand. It was a silent continuance of their play, a dare.</p><p>Sophia parted her lips, but whatever she was going to say was lost as she sucked in a breath, a spread of black staining her eyes. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>Sophia felt herself kicked into a memory retrieval with ruthless force. Except this was different. Not only the violence with which she\u2019d been plunged into the memory, but her orientation within in. Usually, with other people\u2019s memories, she saw what the individual in question had seen, looked through his or her eyes.</p><p>Here, it was as if she was an impartial observer, a third party wholly unconnected to the events playing out below\u2014in what appeared to be a filthy alley crushed between two dirty tenement buildings.</p><p>They were children. Two boys. The dark haired one was painfully thin, his legs too long for his body, his eyes liquid dark in a face that was so beautiful, she knew he must\u2019ve gotten teased for it\u2014but he\u2019d grown into that face, turned it savagely masculine with sheer strength of will. \u201cYou gotta stop this,\u201d he said to the boy opposite him.</p><p>He smiled, that boy with his incredible lilac eyes and hair the color of ripe wheat turned to gold. If the first boy was beautiful, this one was a young god. His lips were flawlessly shaped, his skin porcelain, and his voice, when he spoke, as clear as the purest of bells. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The first boy, the boy Sophia knew, grabbed his friend\u2019s arm, turning it over to reveal the ugliness of needle tracks. \u201cIf this is what it\u2019s doing to you on the outside, what do you think it\u2019s doing to you on the inside?\u201d</p><p>The other boy smiled again and this time, Sophia caught it, that odd disconnection in his gaze, the stare of someone who wasn\u2019t quite present. \u201cIt takes me flying, Maxie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d Max\u2019s hands on the other boy\u2019s face, forcing the golden child to meet his gaze, his voice flint hard. \u201cIt\u2019s just make-believe. You know that. When you crash, it hurts.\u201d</p><p>A moment of strange clarity. \u201cSo what? What\u2019s so good about our life? Huh?\u201d The golden child cupped Max\u2019s face in turn. \u201cOne of her men tried to touch me last night.\u201d</p><p>Cold rage turned Max\u2019s expression to ice. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>Truth, Sophia thought, that was the unvarnished truth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Mum screamed and kicked him out.\u201d He pressed his forehead to Max\u2019s in a painful kind of affection. \u201cShe protects me. Why doesn\u2019t she protect you?\u201d</p><p>Thin shoulders sagging for an instant. \u201cI don\u2019t know, River.\u201d</p><p>A vivid blackness, a connection being cut, and Sophia felt air whistling into her lungs in a violent, biting rush.</p><p>\u201cSophie! Look at me.\u201d Max\u2019s hand on her cheek, a tactile shock that made her eyes snap open.</p><p>He dropped his hand at once, white lines bracketing his mouth. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d Her throat was shredded, lined with a million splinters. \u201cGet me home. Please, Max.\u201d</p><p>And somehow, he did.</p><p>Her knees buckled the instant they were inside his apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d Catching her up in his arms\u2014and being careful to avoid any skin-to-skin contact\u2014Max carried her to the sofa. But instead of setting her down, he took a seat with her in his lap. \u201cShh,\u201d he said when she grew stiff. \u201cLet me hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to do this.\u201d A fierce whisper.</p><p>When he did nothing except hold her, she relaxed, laying her head on his shoulder. It was so tempting to place her hand on his other shoulder, but he was only wearing a fine cotton shirt and she wasn\u2019t sure if the barrier would be strong enough. Not after the impact of what she\u2019d seen, and with him so warm and solid around her, the scent of him an unambiguously masculine blend of heat, soap, and a fresh pine that she knew was his aftershave.</p><p>Drawing it in, she sighed, melting into his embrace. She could have cuddled into him forever, but she had to know, had to ask. \u201cWho is River?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max froze at the quiet question, his heart punching against his ribs so hard, he half expected to see blood dot his chest. \u201cMy younger brother.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stilled within his arms, but her question, when it came, was practical. Psy. \u201cYou have clear markers of Asian descent, while he was unquestionably Caucasian.\u201d</p><p>The logical query calmed him, gave him an anchor. \u201cHe looked\u2014looks exactly like our mother.\u201d River had been her shadow and her mirror. And in the end that knowledge had broken his brother. \u201cWe had different fathers. His was as blond as our mother.\u201d While Max\u2019s was an unknown, a man who\u2019d given him only the genetic heritage of another culture. \u201cNo one ever believed we were brothers.\u201d But they were. They\u2019d come from the same womb, grown up in the same hell.</p> <p>\u201cIs he\u2014\u201d A pause, a long breath. \u201cYou wanted to use the past tense.\u201d</p><p>Another stab of pain, but he didn\u2019t tell her to drop the subject. It had been so long since he\u2019d spoken of River to someone who\u2019d known him\u2014and somehow, he knew his J did. \u201cRiver disappeared when I was almost fourteen and he was eleven. He was so lost in the drugs by then that I know he can\u2019t have survived long . . . but part of me wakes up every morning hoping that when I open the door, I\u2019ll see him on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shifted position, her gloved hand rising to curve hesitantly over the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Max. I didn\u2019t mean to invade your memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought my shield\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMost telepaths who are born with the ability to be Js often also have some latent or weak F abilities.\u201d</p> <p>Max frowned. \u201cForeseers see the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually, yes. But there is a small subgroup that sees the past. It\u2019s termed backsight.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was talking so factually because she\u2019d read his pain, was trying to distance him from it the only way she knew how, his vulnerable J with a heart that understood how much memories could hurt. \u201cYou saw River in a flash of backsight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s the first incident I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Eyes haunted, she placed her hand on his shoulder. \u201cIf statistics hold true, that\u2019s probably the single one I\u2019ll ever experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never felt so helpless,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d His heart twisted\u2014there\u2019d been no horror in her eyes, so perhaps she\u2019d seen a slice of happiness.</p><p>\u201cYou and your brother in an alley. You were trying to talk him out of doing drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried so many times.\u201d Max dropped his head against her. \u201cHe was the one person I loved, the one person who mattered. But I couldn\u2019t save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so young,\u201d Sophia said.</p><p>\u201cAnd damaged\u2014so much that he couldn\u2019t see any other way out.\u201d Max wished he could go back in time, convince River that none of it was his fault. \u201cHe blamed himself for things over which he had no control.\u201d</p><p>Her hand stroked his nape, soft, hesitant, but gaining in confidence. \u201cHe said . . . he said . . .\u201d</p><p>And he knew she hadn\u2019t missed out on the horror. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said she didn\u2019t protect you.\u201d</p> <p>The pain of the child he\u2019d been speared through him. \u201cIt was as if my mother had two personalities.\u201d One for each son. \u201cAs an adult, I know I could\u2019ve done nothing to bring on the kind of hatred she felt toward me\u2014but part of me still believes that I did something to make her treat me the way she did.\u201d His voice broke.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s breath whispered over his hair as she held him, as she, a woman born of a race with no emotion, gave him more affection than the woman who\u2019d given birth to him.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>Sascha lay curled up in bed around six that evening, tired though she\u2019d done very little. But she didn\u2019t feel the need to move\u2014it was nice to lie surrounded by the warm, masculine scent of the panther who was her mate. Snuggling into his pillow, she opened up the text that was her own personal guidebook\u2014and an endless source of frustration.</p><p>However, she felt more hopeful of deciphering the oblique nature of some of the chapters today, after having spoken to a Forgotten empath, an elderly lady named Maya.</p><p>\u201cOnly cardinals could stop riots,\u201d Maya had said in response to Sascha\u2019s question, her trim figure active as she paced in front of her comm screen. \u201cSo I wasn\u2019t taught how, but I have a vague memory of my grandmother talking about a \u2018terminal field.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Maya hadn\u2019t been able to dig up any memories of what the term might actually mean, but it was a start. With that in mind, Sascha was about to reread the section on riot control when she heard Lucas moving about in the living area. \u201cLucas.\u201d She kept her tone soft, knowing he\u2019d hear.</p><p>He filled the doorway, all green eyes and dark hair. Such a beautiful man, was her mate. Such a dangerous one, too, especially when the protective streak that had been honed in blood was riding him. \u201cDo you have time to discuss something?\u201d</p><p>His expression gentled. \u201cTwo minutes? I want to send this note off to Zara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d Watching as he left, she played with the spine of the Eldridge book.</p><p>\u201cYou need a better bedtime story.\u201d Lucas prowled in to sprawl on his back beside her.</p><p>She raised her head instinctively, and he slid one arm beneath before turning to curve his big body around hers. It had become their favorite sleeping position.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleepy,\u201d she said. \u201cJust wanted to rest my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a foot rub.\u201d</p><p>Joy shimmered through her, an incandescent light. \u201cLucas, you do realize you\u2019re spoiling me beyond redemption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I plan to ignore you once you give me my baby princess.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, secure in the knowledge of his love. \u201cDid you manage to talk to Sienna?\u201d The teenager, part of a family of Psy defectors that had found sanctuary with the SnowDancer wolves, had been staying with DarkRiver on and off for the past few months.</p><p>\u201cShe got up to the SnowDancer den safe and sound.\u201d A kiss pressed to the sensitive skin below her ear. \u201cShe\u2019s a very good driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kit?\u201d The DarkRiver male was a young soldier, a future alpha\u2014and appeared to be forming an attachment to Sienna.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still down here.\u201d Lucas sounded as if he was frowning in thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we have any right to say anything. They\u2019re both adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if Sienna is thinking straight.\u201d The Psy teenager had been close to the breaking point when she first came to stay with DarkRiver. She\u2019d stabilized since then, but . . . \u201cHow\u2019s Hawke?\u201d</p><p>Lucas didn\u2019t curse at the mention of the SnowDancer alpha, an indication of just how seriously he was taking this. \u201cSeems fine, but it\u2019s hard to read another alpha\u2014we get pretty good at keeping our thoughts to ourselves when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke and Sienna\u2014there\u2019s something there.\u201d A raw, almost angry fury. \u201cWith Kit, it\u2019s harder to pinpoint. I can sense something between them, but what, I can\u2019t yet tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit would be the better choice for her,\u201d Lucas said in a quiet tone that did nothing to hide the depth of his concern for everyone involved. \u201cHawke isn\u2019t going to be easy on any woman he takes as his own. And the fact is, he lost the girl who would\u2019ve been his mate as a child. I don\u2019t know if his wolf will allow him to accept another female on that level.\u201d</p><p>Sascha had no answer to that. Like changeling leopards, wolves mated for life. She\u2019d sensed Hawke\u2019s anger, his wolf\u2019s tormented rage, but she\u2019d also sensed Sienna\u2019s anguish at her response to the SnowDancer alpha. And then there was Kit\u2014gorgeous, loyal, strong Kit.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you wanted to discuss?\u201d Lucas took the book from her hand and put it on the bedside table before returning to hold her close again.</p><p>The imp of mischief that had awakened after she mated with Lucas made a sudden appearance. \u201cNo\u2014did you hear the wolves are calling Mercy \u2018their\u2019 sentinel?\u201d</p><p>A growl that made every hair on her body rise in primal response. \u201cShe might\u2019ve had the bad taste to mate with a wolf, but she\u2019s ours. They try to co-opt her, I\u2019ll be giving you a nice, new Hawke-fur coat for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>Unable to withhold her laughter, she patted his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d But the panther was laughing with her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She knew he was talking about Nikita, about the confused emotions in Sascha\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Sophie, my sweet, sexy, Sophie, I do think I\u2019d like to unbutton that perfect little suit jacket. After that, I\u2019d like to slip each and every tiny pearl button out of its slot to open your shirt to the waist.</p><p>\u2014Handwritten note from Max to Sophia</p><p>Max walked out of the shower an hour later to find Morpheus glaring at him from the bed. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, pulling on a pair of jeans and a dark green T-shirt.</p><p>The cat continued to glare.</p><p>\u201cI fed you,\u201d Max muttered, glad for the prosaic reality of life for giving him a way out of the memories that had haunted him for over a decade. \u201cDon\u2019t scowl at me because you snarfed it in one minute and now have a stomachache.\u201d</p><p>Morpheus licked his paw. He was not amused.</p><p>Deciding not to pet the damn cat right then in case it decided to bite off his hand, he ran a comb through his hair and walked out to the kitchen. Thanks to the grocery shopping he\u2019d done the day he arrived, he had all the ingredients for the dinner he planned to cook for Sophia.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we focus on the case?\u201d she\u2019d asked before she left his apartment, her eyes huge. \u201cMy incident has already taken time we could\u2019ve spent going over the evidence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d realized, with a strange warmth in his chest, that she was once again trying to help him in her own way\u2014that smart mind had figured out he\u2019d feel better if he buried himself in work. \u201cWe can discuss as we eat,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cAnd, I think we\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the pattern we talked about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith the victims all being murdered on the verge of a major deal?\u201d An intent look. \u201cEdward Chan\u2019s murder doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did some digging on that.\u201d He\u2019d set his cell phone to run a number of Internet searches, glanced at the results as they finished up the final interview today. \u201cChan was scheduled to speak before a group of changeling alphas in South America later this week. No Psy has ever before been acceded that right.\u201d</p><p>Sophia had gone very quiet. \u201cDid they kill him because he was about to get Nikita access to a major untapped market\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014or because the contact would\u2019ve violated a belief in Purity?\u201d From what he\u2019d learned of Pure Psy, he was convinced they wouldn\u2019t shy away from murder. \u201cNo way to tell. But I\u2019m going to call Nikita, alert her to the possibility.\u201d</p><p>When he did contact Nikita, she\u2019d not only agreed with his theory, she\u2019d confirmed that no other project was at a stage which might trigger a kill. \u201cI\u2019ve also got twenty-four-hour surveillance on all my high-level people. They won\u2019t be easy targets\u2014and if one of them is behind this, it should give him pause.\u201d</p> <p>Now, as Max began to prepare dinner, he considered the possible impact of his and Sophia\u2019s investigation on the conspiracy. Not significant, he decided. Whoever was behind this\u2014the kingpin\u2014was running things with a cool, clear head. He or she wouldn\u2019t be put off their game by a mere human and a J at the end of her useful life.</p><p>His jaw went tight just as the doorbell chimed. Putting down the knife he\u2019d been using to chop up some herbs, he went to the door and pulled it open. The woman at the center of his thoughts stood on the other side dressed in jeans and a cardigan in a delicate cream shade that made him want to peel it open\u2014to expose skin of an even richer cream.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d Her voice was tentative when he continued to block the doorway.</p><p>He stepped back, waiting until she was inside and away from the cameras before he gave in to the urge to touch her. Lifting away her hair, he pressed a single kiss to the soft skin of her nape.</p><p>Her shiver was violent, but she didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was meant to contribute anything to the meal.\u201d A breathy voice, her head angled slightly to the side, as if she was welcoming another kiss.</p><p>Unable to resist the exquisite temptation, he moved behind her, put his hands on her hips, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be dessert.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia felt her throat lock, her skin stretch painfully taut over her body. \u201cAre you playing?\u201d she finally managed to say. \u201cLike with the notes?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s breath against her neck. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She balled her fingers into fists. An emotional reaction. One that would\u2019ve concerned her before she\u2019d decided to live . . . to love. She wasn\u2019t sure she knew how, wasn\u2019t sure the capacity hadn\u2019t been cut out of her with brutal efficiency. But Max was important. She\u2019d kill for him, she thought, this man who saw in her a woman worth trusting . . . a woman worth teasing. \u201cThis cardigan has pearl buttons, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His body seemed to relax a fraction at her reference to the note he\u2019d dropped into her bag earlier, and she hoped she\u2019d brought some light into his heart. \u201cWitch.\u201d</p><p>Releasing her clenched fingers one by one, she lifted her hands and then, very deliberately, stripped off her gloves. Dropping them to the floor, she reached for his hand.</p><p>His palm met hers, his fingers twining with her own to curl into her palm.</p><p>For an instant, everything went black. When she could see again, she found herself leaning against Max\u2019s chest, his free hand curved over her abdomen as he held her against the masculine heat of his body. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d A rough murmur.</p><p>She clung to the strength of him, the lean muscle of his body a solid wall in a shifting universe. It was difficult to breathe\u2014he was in the air, too, an invisible caress. Dark, potent, male, Max surrounded her.</p> <p>\u201cYour shields,\u201d he said against her ear, his lips touching her skin in small, erotic bites. \u201cAre you safe?\u201d</p><p>Knowing he was right to be concerned, she opened her psychic eye and checked her protections against the PsyNet, ready to patch any fractures, hide any weaknesses. What she saw made her go motionless. \u201cThey\u2019re holding, but not in a normal way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy shields have always been rock solid, but now . . . they\u2019re moving. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m in the middle of a tornado.\u201d The psychic wind blew back her hair as she stood shocked in the center of her mind. \u201cNothing can get in or out because the layers shift constantly, tearing apart anything that attempts to penetrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it harming you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s efficient beyond anything I\u2019ve ever seen, but it may bring attention to me.\u201d She\u2019d survived this long by being faultless when it came to her work, but deliberately unremarkable in any other way\u2014the perfect Psy.</p><p>Even as she spoke, there was a mental knock on her mind. \u201cSomeone\u2019s seen,\u201d she said, before answering the telepathic contact. Sir.</p><p>Jay Khanna\u2019s psychic voice was clear, direct, his telepathic reach close to 9.8 on the Gradient. That reach had given rise to speculation that the reason Khanna had been taken off the active roster at an early age was because the Council had other uses for his telepathy. Ms. Russo, he said now, there\u2019s been a significant change in your shields. Do you need assistance?</p><p>It was a thinly veiled query about whether her conditioning was close to total collapse. If she said yes, she\u2019d be picked up for emergency reconditioning\u2014and find herself undergoing total and comprehensive rehabilitation, her memories of Max scrubbed away, her mind broken until it was nothing but an empty shell.</p><p>Silently thanking the M-Psy who\u2019d told her the truth about her status, she said, My shields appear to have evolved to provide better protection.</p><p>Shields do not evolve.</p><p>No, she thought, they didn\u2019t. I misspoke, sir. I\u2019ve been working with the idea of this type of a shield for a while\u2014they simply went into effect before I planned. It was a reasonable response\u2014all Js tinkered constantly with their shields in an effort to eke out another day, another hour of life.</p><p>Khanna accepted her explanation, his tone retaining its professionalism as he switched topics. Have you reviewed the Valentine file?</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>And your conclusions?</p><p>Remain unchanged.</p><p>Very well. Continue with your current assignment.</p><p>Ending the telepathic conversation, Sophia sagged against Max, telling him what had occurred. Max moved the hand he had on her abdomen, inciting a strange twisting sensation in her body. It wasn\u2019t painful. No, it was . . . interesting. \u201cWhat else is up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour expression changed toward the end.\u201d</p><p>She thought about what her boss had asked her to do, thought, too, what it would mean to share that with Max. He\u2019d know. What she\u2019d done. The lines she\u2019d crossed. Pain rippled down her spine. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you,\u201d she said, incapable of any sophisticated evasion when it came to this man.</p><p>To her surprise, Max squeezed her hips and said, \u201cKeep your secrets\u201d\u2014his voice an intimate darkness in her ear\u2014\u201cfor now.\u201d</p><p>Max felt Sophia\u2019s hand tighten on his, wanted only to bend his head even farther and put his mouth on the unsteady beat of her pulse, suck hard. The possessive urge, the violent need to claim her to the core was a gnawing ache in his gut. He wanted the world to know she was his\u2014make certain no one would dare lay a finger on her.</p><p>It took every ounce of will he had to fight the craving and lead her to the bar stools on this side of the kitchen counter. Dropping her hand, he put both of his around her waist and lifted her onto a stool.</p><p>Her hands flew to his shoulders. Gripped.</p><p>A sweep of black erased her irises between one blink and the next.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d He squeezed her waist. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She blinked, but the black remained. \u201cIt happens when we utilize a strong burst of psychic power, or . . . I suppose\u201d\u2014a wash of color across her cheekbones\u2014\u201cfeel an intense emotional response.\u201d</p><p>The maleness in him smiled in sensual satisfaction. \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Leaning forward, he slicked his lips over her own, a tease that made his cock throb\u2014but conscious of how far he\u2019d already pushed her, he was on the other side of the counter before she exhaled and swiveled to face him.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she said, \u201cwas . . . interesting.\u201d Her chest rose and fell in long, deep breaths, her skin colored with a heat that invited a man\u2019s mouth.</p><p>The excruciating pulse of his body, the unremitting hunger, might\u2019ve consumed him if he hadn\u2019t had something critically important in mind for this evening. \u201cLet me finish making this sauce,\u201d he said, voice rough with sexual desire. \u201cYou want to shred the lettuce for the salad?\u201d</p><p>He waited until she\u2019d washed her hands and retaken her seat before asking the question to which he needed an answer before he could begin to work out how to engineer her defection, how to keep her forever. \u201cSophia\u2014I\u2019ve been patient.\u201d His hand fisted, because he knew this truth would be nothing good, but at least he\u2019d have a starting point. \u201cTell me where Js go when they stop working.\u201d</p><p>A quiet, quiet moment. \u201cSome who are removed from the active roster early enough take up desk jobs in Justice,\u201d she said in a voice so soft he had to strain to hear her, \u201cothers go insane, and the rest of us . . . we die.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Max staggered, bracing his hands on the counter. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Sensitivity\u201d\u2014she glanced back at her discarded gloves\u2014\u201cis a result of failing telepathic shields. They\u2019re so thin now that when they shear, the thoughts of every man, woman, and child in this city will smash into my brain, crush my mind.\u201d</p> <p>The brutal forecast had Max clenching his jaw. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d</p><p>Anger\u2014hot, protective, violent\u2014was a rush of white noise in his ears. \u201cWhen were you planning to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Sophia swallowed at the tautly held fury in that question. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d It hurt her to see him so angry with her. \u201cI thought if you knew how . . . broken I truly was, you wouldn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d A low, dark word, a shake of his head that made the sleek black strands of his hair catch the light. \u201cThey\u2019ll rehabilitate you if they find out how close you are to the edge, that\u2019s the bottom line?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders firmed, the intelligence in his eyes a razor. \u201cThey can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re out of the Net. We\u2019ll figure out a way to fucking rebuild your shields once you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>He was fighting for her, she thought with a wrench deep inside of her. Never had anyone fought for her. She\u2019d never been important enough. It broke what fragile defenses she might\u2019ve still had\u2014she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, hold back the final truth. \u201cWithout the biofeedback my mind needs from the Net,\u201d she began, \u201cI\u2019ll die within seconds.\u201d Realizing she\u2019d somehow shredded the entire lettuce, she began to peel the cucumber on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSascha isn\u2019t dead.\u201d Max pushed back from the counter, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cNeither are the other Psy in DarkRiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019ve found an exit route.\u201d Finished with the peeling, she began to slice the cucumber into precise, thin slices. \u201cHowever, even should such an exit be open to other Js, I couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>A silent pause, his thrumming anger a whip against her skin.</p> <p>\u201cI function as a minor anchor.\u201d Sophia knew she shouldn\u2019t be speaking of this. The agony spearing through her nerves, a conditioned response, told her it was deeply forbidden. But she wanted, needed, Max to understand.</p><p>\u201cKeep talking.\u201d It was an order.</p><p>Part of her wanted to rebel, but she knew she\u2019d pushed him too far\u2014anything more might destroy this bond between them, this beautiful thing that had never been meant for someone so broken\u2014but that she refused to give up. Max was her gift. \u201cAnchors are literally that,\u201d she said, fighting the pain with the stubborn possessiveness inside of her. \u201cThey\u2019re born with the ability to merge into the PsyNet itself. They help keep it stable and are almost always cardinals.\u201d</p><p>Max tapped the counter in front of her. Jerking up her head, she saw him holding out a hand. \u201cKnife.\u201d</p><p>She gave it to him, realizing the cucumber was now in hundreds of tiny, tiny squares. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>No shrug, no smile that revealed the lean dimple in his cheek. The loss speared through her. She\u2019d seen human and changeling women coax their men into smiles, but had never imagined she might one day need to do the same. Or that she\u2019d so desperately want to. Getting off the stool, she wiped her hands on a towel. \u201cMax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pinned her with his gaze. \u201cSo help me, Sophie, I\u2019m so fucking mad at you right now\u2014\u201d He blew out a breath. \u201cHelp me set the table.\u201d</p><p>She gave in, aware for the first time that Max\u2019s relentless will would, of course, translate into an inexorable kind of anger. Neither of them spoke again until they were seated across from each other, their meals in front of them. Morpheus appeared out of nowhere to sit on her feet.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t feed him,\u201d Max said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting fat.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an innocent look even as she discreetly dropped a piece of bread for the cat\u2014who seemed to have a strange predilection for it. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>A glint of amusement lit the cold fire in his eyes. \u201cIf\u201d\u2014he sat back, a tiger momentarily at rest\u2014\u201canchors are usually cardinals, why are you doing their job?\u201d His biceps drew her eye as he clasped his hands at the back of his head.</p><p>It was difficult to think past the compulsion she had to get up and peel Max\u2019s T-shirt off his body, long-dormant instincts awakening to tell her that touch would reach him far faster and deeper than words ever could.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to play\u201d\u2014a low, dark voice\u2014\u201cuntil you\u2019re straight with me. Then we\u2019ll talk about punishment.\u201d</p><p>Her toes curled. \u201cCardinals,\u201d she managed to say through the crashing wave of need, \u201care rare, and cardinals who can be anchors are even rarer.\u201d Agony spiked out of nowhere, wiping out the other sensations. There was, it seemed, one thread of conditioning still active in her\u2014the Council did not like Psy speaking about the critical network of anchors.</p><p>\u201cHowever, non-cardinal individuals can sometimes develop the ability to merge with the Net.\u201d She gripped her knees tight in order to ride out the increasing waves of pain. \u201cWe\u2019re not true anchors\u2014more like . . . small weights on the net, helping to keep it in shape, in place. There aren\u2019t enough true anchors to do everything.\u201d</p><p>Morpheus patted her foot with a paw. Glad for the touch of reality, she snuck him another piece of bread as Max spoke. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t make sense. No self-supporting ecosystem would effectively cripple itself.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, having never thought of it that way. While she was still trying to figure out how the shortage could have occurred, Max forked up a bite of rice, lifted it to her lips.</p><p>She opened her mouth without thought, let him feed her. The feel of the tines sliding out from between her lips was a cool, slow pleasure. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked after swallowing the unexpected bite. \u201cI thought you were angry with me?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile. \u201cI find myself fascinated by your mouth. The things I\u2019d like to do to it . . . Even when I\u2019m furious, you make me crazy, J.\u201d</p><p>A brush of heat across her body, a physiological reaction she didn\u2019t quite understand . . . but one that wiped out the pain. Oh. She looked at him, at her cop. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d About the pain, about the hurt.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you.\u201d The sensual teasing disappeared from his face. \u201cNow tell me why anchors can\u2019t leave the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost Psy have a single link to the Net deep within their mind, and the defectors must have cut that link to leave, but anchors are woven into the PsyNet\u2019s very fabric by millions upon millions of fine connections.\u201d The Net was both safety and a steel cage. \u201cIf I tried to leave, death would be instantaneous\u2014but that\u2019s not the worst part. Because of the particular way I\u2019m integrated into its framework, part of me, my memories, my personality, is anchored in the Net.\u201d</p><p>Max put down his fork, appetite gone. \u201cYou\u2019re saying you\u2019ll effectively rehabilitate yourself if you try to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Max wasn\u2019t sure he believed that. From what he could tell, Silence was a form of brainwashing. And what better way to ensure compliance than by convincing someone they couldn\u2019t leave the Net?</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve been blinded to the truth.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise him anymore, that she was able to read him with such ease. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in that world your whole life. It\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s right in front of you sometimes.\u201d He\u2019d spent his childhood pretending his mother loved him. It had been necessary for his survival, but it had been a willful blindness. In Sophia\u2019s case, it was more likely a conditioned response.</p><p>But she shook her head, her eyes bleak. \u201cJs are, by the nature of our work, far more aware of the harsh realities of life than other Psy. I\u2019ve looked at the issue from every angle, and the unavoidable fact is that once integrated in such a complex way, a mind cannot physically disengage\u2014even if I somehow survived the physical brain damage, the person who remained wouldn\u2019t be Sophia Russo.\u201d</p><p>Cold spread through his veins, but he wasn\u2019t about to give up. \u201cAre you going to tell me how you developed the ability to merge with the Net, why you\u2019re so inexorably tied to it?\u201d He\u2019d heard something in her words when she\u2019d spoken of it, a slight hesitation that pricked at his instincts.</p><p>She put down her own fork. \u201cCan we sit nearer to each other?\u201d</p><p>His gut clenched at the polite way she\u2019d asked for comfort\u2014ready for rejection. Always so ready to be rejected. He wondered if she was even aware of it, but he was, and it savaged him to realize how badly she\u2019d been hurt. \u201cYeah. Let me clear the table first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you. We may as well wash them so that we can concentrate on the case later on.\u201d It was as she was drying a dish\u2014having replaced her gloves\u2014that Max couldn\u2019t stand the painful quietness of her any longer. Moving behind her, he pressed a kiss to the curve of her neck.</p><p>She dropped the dish.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Placing the unbroken item on the counter in front of her, he pushed back and forced himself to head to the coffeemaker, though he wanted only to wrap his arms around her and hold her tight, so tight. \u201cSomething to drink?\u201d</p><p>Sophia answered without thought. \u201cYes.\u201d Hands still trembling, she watched as he poured a single cup of coffee, then heated up a mug of milk. She wanted to touch her fingers to her neck, to feel the echo of his kiss, the slight rasp of his unshaven jaw against her skin.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d A quiet command, eyes that drew her forward.</p><p>Closing the small distance between them, she parted her lips to ask for another kiss\u2014driven by her need to be with him\u2014when he took the spoon he\u2019d been using to stir a dark mix into the milk and put it to her lips. \u201cTaste.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to do anything else. The burst of sensation was sharp, almost bitter, exquisite in its richness. She put her hand on his wrist when he would\u2019ve withdrawn the spoon, the feel of him solid and tempting under her glove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaking his head in a gentle tease, Max drew away the spoon, slow, so slow. \u201cThe whole cup\u2019s for you.\u201d Then he leaned forward and kissed her, licking his tongue over the seam of her lips as if to steal the flavor.</p><p>She gripped his T-shirt as the floor disappeared from beneath her. Groaning, Max pulled back\u2014but only after grazing her lower lip with his teeth. Liquid warmth pooled between her thighs, making her body clench.</p><p>\u201cTake your chocolate\u201d\u2014an order in a voice gone sandpaper rough\u2014\u201cand go sit before I give in to temptation and unbutton your cardigan, put my hands on your beautiful breasts.\u201d</p> <p>He turned away even as she tried to process the searing sensuality of that image. The idea of those strong, clever hands on her flesh, that sleek hair brushing over her as he bent closer . . . How did women survive such vicious cravings? Holding the chocolate he\u2019d made for her, she watched her cop\u2019s T-shirt stretch across his shoulders as he raised his arm to put the mix back into an upper cabinet.</p><p>He was beautiful.</p><p>And he\u2019d given her the right to touch him. Even mad, he wouldn\u2019t push her away, wouldn\u2019t reject her as imperfect.</p><p>Not giving herself a chance to change her mind, she put down the mug, closed the distance between them, and wrapped her arms around him from behind, resting her cheek against his back.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p> <p>The masculine fire of him soaked through her skin, a near-painful bite. \u201cWhen I began to show J tendencies as a child,\u201d she said, holding on, holding tight, \u201cI was placed in a residential facility with other telepaths who needed specialized training.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s hands closed over her gloved ones, but he didn\u2019t turn, letting her use his body as a shield against the dark that had never set her free. \u201cSomeone hurt you there.\u201d His voice was jagged, his muscles rigid.</p><p>\u201cWe were in a remote location,\u201d she said, finding courage in his strength. \u201cBecause young telepaths, especially those with unusual abilities, tend to have trouble with shields, it\u2019s easier to train us out of the cities.\u201d Practical words, but the other half of her, the half that had been born that summer two decades ago, clung to the solid wall of Max, afraid, so very afraid. \u201cSo there was no one to notice that our instructor was beginning to act beyond Silence. Like Bonner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a true sociopath.\u201d Icy rage in every word.</p><p>She held it close, used it as a weapon against the past. \u201cThe summer I turned eight, he took four of us\u2014four trainee Js\u2014to another, even more remote location for intensive drills. Before we left, he requested and received permission to enclose us in his shields so that we could drop ours without consequences should we have trouble during the drills.\u201d Her fingers dug into Max\u2019s chest, and she wanted to tear through the fabric, press her skin to his, bury the past under an agony of sensation.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d A voice scraped raw. \u201cI can wait, baby. I\u2019m sorry for\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She wanted him to know, needed him to know. \u201cOnce our instructor\u201d\u2014she couldn\u2019t say his name, her terror too deep\u2014\u201chad us alone and in the cage of his shield . . . he hurt us.\u201d Sophia could still remember their shock, their inability to understand. \u201cCarrie died the first day. She was the smallest, the weakest.\u201d And the monster had broken her in his eagerness.</p><p>\u201cHe was more careful after that. Bilar died on the third day.\u201d He\u2019d convulsed in front of her and Lin, and they could do nothing to help, their hands and feet tied behind their backs, their mouths taped shut. Sophia had dared the monster\u2019s anger and reached out with her telepathy, refusing to let Bilar die alone. His screams had echoed inside her mind for hours.</p><p>Max\u2019s hands tightened on hers. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t your parents, the watchers in your PsyNet, sense his deviancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see, Max?\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cHe was the perfect Psy.\u201d Silence didn\u2019t differentiate between those who had been conditioned and those who simply did not feel.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201dA quiet question asked in a voice that made the other half of her, the scared broken child, go motionless, wondering . . .</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d When he didn\u2019t say anything else, she continued. \u201cLin and I, we were the last two left. He was nine, I was eight.\u201d She felt her heart begin to speed up, her spine to knot. \u201cThe monster didn\u2019t want to break us too fast, so he was careful. But one day he did something to me, and I didn\u2019t respond like he wanted. I didn\u2019t scream. So he threw me headfirst through the large glass window at the front of the cabin.\u201d Pain, blood, the glitter of glass in the sun, she\u2019d never forget any part of it.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Sophie.\u201d Max\u2019s entire body was so hard, so unmoving, she\u2019d have thought him stone but for the furious beat of his heart.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know. Please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never have to beg me for anything.\u201d A harsh order.</p><p>\u201cLin saved me,\u201d she said, clasping his words to her soul. \u201cWhile the monster was outside, checking to see if I\u2019d survived, he somehow managed to get to the comm panel, input the emergency code.\u201d And then Lin, the sweet, talented telepath who might\u2019ve been her friend in another life, had died, his internal injuries too massive. \u201cEveryone\u2019s forgotten them. Carrie, Bilar, and Lin, but I remember. Someone should remember.\u201d</p><p>This time, Max did move. Pulling away, he turned. She went into his arms, ready for the heat, the almost violent pleasure-pain. \u201cPeople talk about how the Psy are starting to break,\u201d he said in a fierce whisper, \u201cbut nobody ever speaks about the victims.\u201d</p><p>He understood, she thought, he understood. \u201cWe\u2019re as dirty a secret as the monsters. Those of us who survive are damaged goods, never quite the same. My parents wrote me off, turned me over to the state. I heard them in the hospital. . . . talking about whether it would be better to just put me down.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>Your request to have Sophia Russo, minor, age 8, removed from your official family history has been granted. The state will pay the costs of her care and education until she reaches her majority. You are no longer considered bound to her or responsible for her in any way.</p><p>\u2014Final decision of the Council Subcommittee on</p><p>Genetic Inheritance, November 2060</p><p>Max\u2019s embrace tightened until it almost hurt. But she needed it, craved it. The lost, indelibly fractured half of her clung to him, realizing it was being accepted, no matter the extent of its flaws. \u201cThe anchor thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what saved you. Because it\u2019s a rare ability.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhen the monster threw me through the window, he didn\u2019t just scar my face. He also broke my mind.\u201d She\u2019d been a terrified child who\u2019d finally realized that no help would come, that she\u2019d soon be buried in an unmarked grave beside Carrie and Bilar. \u201cBut my brain didn\u2019t give up. It \u2018rerouted\u2019 itself directly into the fabric of the Net, the only thing big enough to hold together what remained of my psyche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so damn proud of you,\u201d he said, his voice low and husky.</p><p>She wanted to grab onto the commitment, the promise, implicit in his words. \u201cI\u2019m really broken, Max.\u201d It was the final secret, the final truth. \u201cI can pretend to be normal, but I\u2019m not. I never will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou survived\u2014how you\u2019ve done it doesn\u2019t matter. The fact that you have? It\u2019s better revenge on that bastard and the ones that allowed him to do what he did than anything else.\u201d</p><p>Shuddering at the unflinching acceptance in his tone, she moved one hand lightly over his back. His muscles shifted beneath her touch, as if in response. Growing bolder, she pressed harder, felt his abdomen grow taut against her. It was instinct to spread out her hand, run her fingernails over the fabric in sensual exploration.</p><p>Swearing low under his breath, Max moved back a step, gripping her arms at the elbows. \u201cAren\u2019t you going too fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She could feel her nerves, ragged and frayed, close to overload, but still she wanted more, wanted to fill herself to the brim with him, until she had enough for a lifetime. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Max. The touch keeps me here.\u201d Not in the past.</p><p>Max groaned. \u201cDrink. And behave.\u201d He put the hot chocolate in her hands and picking up his coffee, headed to the couch.</p><p>Left with no choice, she followed a second later. Putting her drink beside his on the coffee table, she turned her body sideways on the couch, terrified she\u2019d scared him with the voracious depth of her need . . . but not ready to accept his decree. He\u2019d told her she\u2019d never have to beg. He\u2019d accepted her. He was hers. \u201cI\u2019m not misbehav\u2014\u201d</p><p>Max had his mouth on Sophia\u2019s before he could think about the consequences, his hand tangled in her hair. God, he was so angry over what had been done to her, so fucking pissed at the parents who\u2019d rejected her when they should\u2019ve stood by her. And because he\u2019d die before he hurt her, his anger had nowhere to go\u2014except into a raging protectiveness. Running his tongue along the seam of her lips, he urged her to part for him. And when she did, he swept in without hesitation, taking, tasting, claiming.</p><p>Her hands fell to rest on his thigh, excruciatingly close to his cock. Releasing his grip on her, he picked up those delicate gloved hands and put them on his shoulders. She clenched her fingers on him, her nails biting just enough through the thin gloves and the material of his T-shirt to make him want to strip it all off and tell her to use those nails on his flesh. Hell. Breaking the kiss, he put his hands on her waist. \u201cStraddle me.\u201d</p><p>She was all huge eyes and kiss-bruised mouth, but she did as he asked, her curvy body coming down on his thighs even as she leaned in and took his mouth. He hadn\u2019t expected that, hadn\u2019t expected her to seize the reins. But he was more than willing to let her have her way.</p><p>Her kiss was inexperienced, hesitant, and so arousing, he had to lock his muscles to keep from pushing up that primly buttoned cardigan and cupping a sweet, plump breast in his palm even as he took her mouth in a much more sexual fashion. Instead, he let her sip at him, let her stroke and taste and lick. The last made his fingers clench on her hips. She did it again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia Russo was a quick study.</p><p>Feeling his lips curve in a smile that was more than a little feral, he sucked at her upper lip, bit down on the lower. She jerked, then pressed into him, her arms weaving around his neck. Taking that as a yes, he repeated the caress, moving his hands down her hips and over the taut length of her thighs at the same time. A shuddering moan before she finally tore away her mouth.</p><p>Her eyes were awash in black, a sea of purest midnight. He\u2019d been ready for that. But he wasn\u2019t ready for the fever in her cheeks, the thumping beat of the pulse in her neck, the way her body turned all loose and limber, as if she was drunk. Alarm spiked. \u201cSophie, talk to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Dropping her head to his shoulder, she rubbed her cheek against his T-shirt, a lazy kitten. \u201cI think you blew my circuits.\u201d</p><p>The dazed comment made him want to laugh in spite of the savagery of his emotions\u2014but worry cut the impulse midthought. Maybe this was as close as they\u2019d ever come, him and his Sophie. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>Another lazy rub against him, her hand clenching and unclenching on his other shoulder. \u201cI never realized men and women were so different . . . not really.\u201d Her breath blew hot on the skin of his neck as she spoke, her body a warm, luscious weight against his aroused form. \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you can\u2019t avoid the question.\u201d Brushing her hair very carefully off her face, he looked down to find her eyes closed. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had your foot fall asleep after a period of inactivity?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sharp stabs afterward when you try to use it?\u201d A smile flirted with her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s what it feels like.\u201d Her eyes opened. \u201cI\u2019m waking up, Max. A little pain won\u2019t make me take a step backward.\u201d</p><p>Protectiveness and pride smashed up against each other. \u201cNo more tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Max.\u201d She moved slightly across his body, an erotic stroke and a stubborn will. \u201cNo, please.\u201d</p><p>He let her kiss him again, let her convince him. But when her skin flushed fever hot, when her muscles began to quiver, he broke the contact, lifting her off his body and onto the couch. No matter how much he wanted to claim her in every way a man could claim a woman, he wouldn\u2019t do it if it would destroy her. \u201cNo more, Sophie. You can\u2019t process everything at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He placed a finger against her lips. \u201cThat foot that falls asleep? It doesn\u2019t wake up all at once.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for long moments, but he got a nod at last. Leaving her to repair her shields as much as she could\u2014and it was a fucking fist in his heart that their touching hurt her on any level\u2014he got up, splashed ice water on his face, then returned with the case files. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Taking a sip of the hot chocolate he\u2019d made her, she met his gaze, those eerie eyes of endless black impenetrable, unreadable. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you remember me?\u201d</p><p>His heart broke into a thousand pieces. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Early the next morning found Sascha sitting across from Nikita in a conference room at DarkRiver\u2019s business HQ. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>Nikita\u2019s response was pragmatic. \u201cDarkRiver is an important business partner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a business meeting,\u201d Sascha said, refusing to let her mother ignore the truth. \u201cI thought I made that clear in my request. I\u2019m sorry if you were misled.\u201d</p><p>Nikita remained an ice sculpture on the other side of the table. \u201cEvery contact with you is business. If you weren\u2019t part of DarkRiver, there\u2019d be no need for contact at all.\u201d</p><p>It hurt, yeah, it hurt. But Sascha was stronger now. And she had the strength of the pack behind her. She could feel their wild protectiveness on the other side of the door that enclosed her in this room with Nikita. But most of all, she could feel the love of her panther. \u201cI wanted to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Nikita said without ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to miss.\u201d</p><p>But so many people had, Sascha thought, trying not to read in Nikita\u2019s keen eyes any kind of an emotional meaning. \u201cI\u2019m about five months along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be able to feel the fetus move.\u201d</p><p>Sascha curled her hand into a fist under the table, trying to keep her emotions in check. \u201cYes. The baby is rather feisty, especially at three a.m.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cYou were the same.\u201d</p><p>And there, in that instant, Sascha knew she didn\u2019t understand her mother as well as she thought she did, that Councilor Nikita Duncan had secrets even an empath couldn\u2019t plumb.</p><p>Nikita spoke again before Sascha could. \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that the leopards isolate their pregnant mates during the final months of their pregnancies.\u201d</p><p>Sascha rolled her eyes. \u201cThe tabloids made that up after one of the women in the pack was prescribed bed rest because of complications\u2014you must know how they sensationalize everything.\u201d Her panther, overprotective as he was, would never try to keep her apart from those she considered hers\u2014both in the pack and outside of it. But that wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d asked her mother here to discuss. \u201cWhy did you send me the book by Alice Eldridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cardinal with the strength to control tens of thousands,\u201d Nikita answered, picking up her organizer. \u201cHaving an individual of your strength in my corner would be an asset\u2014the benefit would outweigh any cost associated with your flaw.\u201d</p><p>Once, that would\u2019ve cut Sascha to the quick. Now . . . now she wondered just how many lies Nikita had told her over her lifetime.</p><p>Sophia woke from the most sleepless of nights, her body aching from the inside out, her skin too tight, her nerves shredded. Everything was \u201coff.\u201d Irritation burned inside her, and it had no target, no focus.</p><p>Showering helped calm her body a fraction, and so did an intense ten-minute meditation. Feeling slightly more in control, she dressed in a black pantsuit paired with a white shirt, dried then plaited her hair\u2014baring a violence-touched face Max didn\u2019t seem to find the least objectionable\u2014and forced herself to eat a nutrition bar for breakfast. Her cop, she thought, would not approve.</p><p>Strange twisting sensations in her abdomen, the renewed prickling of her skin. Heat was just starting to spot her cheeks when the doorbell rang. Throwing the wrapper of the nutrition bar in the recycler, she walked over and opened the door.</p><p>It was his scent that hit her first. Exotic and familiar, male in a way she couldn\u2019t explain. But she knew she\u2019d be able to distinguish it from a million others. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he entered, closing the door behind himself. \u201cYou\u2019re flushed. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed gloved hands over her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel . . . edgy. My skin, my body\u2014\u201d</p><p>The worry disappeared from his face, to be replaced by something darker and full of a quiet masculine amusement. \u201cIt\u2019s called frustration, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Frustration: synonymous with aggravation, irritation, dissatisfaction.</p><p>Yes, she thought. That\u2019s the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have more sympathy for you except that I spent the night with a permanent hard-on.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped to his groin. He groaned even as his body reacted rather spectacularly.</p><p>Sophia wanted to touch. \u201cFix it,\u201d she ordered. \u201cYou know how to end my frustration and yours, and I\u2019m no longer as overwrought as I was last night.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath. \u201cYeah? Maybe I do. And maybe so do you.\u201d There was something exquisitely sensual in his words. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>She never got to hear what he would\u2019ve said, because his cell phone beeped at that moment. And everything changed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bart.\u201d All hint of sensuality leaving his expression, Max put the phone to his ear, his responses not telling Sophia much. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d He snapped the phone shut. \u201cBonner\u2019s broken sooner than we thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s angry,\u201d Sophia said, feeling a layer of ice form around her, an impenetrable barrier threaded with dark tendrils that \u201ctasted\u201d of the Net. \u201cHis ego can\u2019t take that I ended yesterday\u2019s comm-conference before he was ready.\u201d Turning, she headed to her bedroom.</p><p>Max caught her arm, felt her tremble though he\u2019d been careful not to touch skin. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPacking an overnight case,\u201d she said, her voice firm, though her body swayed toward his before she caught herself. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk this time, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d She nodded at his cell phone. \u201cCall Nikita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave midcase,\u201d Max said, because though those lost girls owned a piece of his heart, they were already gone, their lights doused. But Sophia, she was alive, her flame flickering against the violent storm of Bonner\u2019s evil. He couldn\u2019t believe that Carissa White and her sisters in death would want him to sacrifice Sophia to bring them home.</p><p>\u201cNikita will allow us to take a short break,\u201d Sophia replied. \u201cAs you said yourself, this killer is unlikely to strike in the near future.\u201d She kept talking, though he could see the jagged rise and fall of her chest, the glittering pain in her eyes. \u201cThe forensic data from Edward Chan\u2019s murder scene will have been more thoroughly processed by the time we return, and we\u2019ve already spoken to the witnesses. We can continue to run deep background checks and verify their alibis for the earlier murders from a distance.\u201d</p><p>Max waited until she paused for breath. \u201cYou have to turn this over to another J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This is mine.\u201d Tiny lines fanned out from the corners of her lush mouth, an indication of stubbornness\u2014one he\u2019d just learned to read. \u201cI\u2019ll do this. I\u2019ll finish this.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t budge\u2014he had a whole streak of stubborn in him, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me how close you are to losing your telepathic shields.

Not today.</p> <p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon:</p><p>State of New York v Bonner</p><p>Nikita wasn\u2019t pleased at the interruption in her investigation, but she didn\u2019t attempt to stand in their way after Max made it clear that not only would they continue to work her case while in Wyoming, but that Bonner\u2019s victims had a prior claim on his loyalty.</p><p>\u201cHow long will this trip take?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf Bonner gives up the bodies\u201d\u2014a grim hope\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll have to inform the parents.\u201d They knew him, trusted him . . . would know why he\u2019d come after so long. \u201cAfter that, forensics will take over. Since Bonner is already in prison for the length of his natural life, it\u2019s not imperative I be there at every moment.\u201d Though before, he would\u2019ve been, would have wanted to see it through to the bitter, destructive end.</p><p>Now, he had other priorities. \u201cI can delegate the supervision to one of the other detectives\u201d\u2014good cops, cops who\u2019d sacrificed weekends, given up vacations, to help Max in the hunt for the Butcher of Park Avenue\u2014\u201cand keep an eye on things from a distance.\u201d Of course, he\u2019d never be free of the Bonner case, not truly. And perhaps he didn\u2019t want to be. A man carried scars on his heart. They made him who he was.</p> <p>Sophie would leave the biggest scar of all.</p><p>No. He refused to lose her, this J with her hunger for touch and her gifted mind.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Detective.\u201d Picking up a cell phone call, she turned to the plate-glass window. \u201cI expect you to keep me informed.\u201d</p><p>Max found himself momentarily caught by the image of Nikita standing silhouetted against the glass, her gaze somewhere far in the distance. Powerful. Lethal. Alone.</p><p>Sascha stretched out her legs on the ottoman in Tammy\u2019s living room and leaned back against the softness of the couch. Like everyone else in DarkRiver, she\u2019d headed to their healer the instant she\u2019d needed comfort of a feminine kind. Lucas had dropped her off after lunch with a kiss\u2014though she knew it was only because Tammy\u2019s mate, Nathan, was home. Likely, there was another sentinel prowling around outside anyway\u2014DarkRiver took the protection of its healer dead seriously.</p><p>Suspicious scrabbles sounded from behind her. Feeling her lips tug upward, she remained in place, her eyes closed. Little click-clacks on the wooden floor, silenced as they hit the rugs. Then a few whispering scratches and she felt a warm, playful presence walk along the top of the sofa back to lie down a few inches from her ear. Another presence, just as playful, a little more mischievous, settled beside her thigh.</p><p>She\u2019d half expected a baby roar to make her jump up in surprise, but when she opened her eyes, Julian and Roman, Tammy\u2019s twins\u2014both in leopard form\u2014were looking at her with expressions so innocent, her heart melted. \u201cHow am I supposed to resist?\u201d she murmured, stroking Jules while she glanced up at Rome.</p><p>Getting up, he padded over to nuzzle at her ear. She tried to catch him in one arm to bring him down, but he jumped onto the couch beside her so she could pet him, too.</p> <p>\u201cAre my little demons bothering you?\u201d Tammy asked, walking into the living room with a tray piled high with Sascha\u2019s favorite chocolate-chip cookies hot from the oven.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being sweethearts,\u201d Sascha said, as Rome settled down with his paws on her thigh, his eyes closing in bliss as she petted his gorgeous little head with firm, sure strokes. \u201cThey\u2019re not as rambunctious with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d Tammy rolled her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re growing up around Nate and the others. They\u2019ve figured out you\u2019re to be \u2018looked after.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Sascha laughed as Tammy took a seat opposite her. Ferocious, the twins\u2019 pet kitten, immediately made himself at home in the healer\u2019s lap. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they both be in kindergarten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing half days at the moment\u2014just got home a few minutes back,\u201d Tamsyn said with a fond smile. \u201cThey both got a good-behavior report from the teacher.\u201d</p><p>Kissing the pad of her index finger, Sascha touched it to the tip of Julian\u2019s nose. Lifting a paw, he nipped playfully at her finger. \u201cWhy do you sound so surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Sascha couldn\u2019t help it, she laughed again, even as Jules and Rome both gave little growls. \u201cThey\u2019ll grow up into wonderful young men, you know.\u201d</p><p>Tammy\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cI know.\u201d Petting a purring Ferocious, she leaned back in her seat. \u201cSo, you saw your mother today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Roman butted against her hand when she stopped stroking him, and she continued at once, scratching him behind the ears in that way he liked before moving up and down through the beautiful gold and black fur of his back. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m fooling myself, but I think . . . there\u2019s something different about her.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn didn\u2019t say anything, just let Sascha talk. And she did. She talked about her hopes, her worries, her fears. \u201cDo you think,\u201d she said at last, \u201cit\u2019s just the emotions of pregnancy? I mean, I love our baby so much. I can\u2019t imagine any mother not feeling this way.\u201d Under her now unmoving hands, Jules and Rome lay curled up, fast asleep, two exquisitely precious lives.</p><p>\u201cPsy are different,\u201d Tammy said at last, \u201cyou know that far better than I ever could. But you\u2019re also an empath, and if your heart tells you there\u2019s some hope of a healthy relationship with Nikita . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sascha said. \u201cI just know I\u2019m not ready to give up on her yet.\u201d</p><p>Tammy\u2019s smile was slow, strong as her healer\u2019s heart. \u201cThen I guess Councilor Nikita Duncan had better watch out.\u201d</p><p>Having dropped a dubious-looking Morpheus off at DarkRiver HQ\u2014to be taken home by Clay\u2014Max and Sophia arrived at the closest airport to the D2 penitentiary less than three hours after Max\u2019s meeting with Nikita. A twenty-minute drive later and they were at the facility.</p><p>\u201cBonner still refusing to talk?\u201d Max asked Bart after Sophia returned to the room, having undergone a quick preliminary checkup at the M-Psy\u2019s hands. Max met her gaze, caught the very slight shake of her head. Relief twisted around his heart\u2014she was hanging on, refusing to surrender to the death that had been stalking her her whole life.</p><p>\u201cBastard hasn\u2019t said a word since he asked for Ms. Russo,\u201d Bart said, glancing at Sophia. \u201cBe careful, Ms. Russo. I have a feeling he\u2019s enraged after we sent in a male J to do a follow-up on his comm-conference with you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cI expected that, Mr. Reuben. Bonner isn\u2019t used to being denied.\u201d</p><p>Max folded his arms across his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d Bonner had been born into wealth, gone to the most exclusive private schools, summered on a vineyard in Champagne, wintered at a ski resort in Switzerland. He\u2019d had simply to ask and his parents had given it to him, their only son\u2014a hundred-thousand-dollar car at sixteen, a trip around the world at seventeen, a private residence on their extensive property at eighteen.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll try to play you,\u201d Bart said, tapping a pen on the old-fashioned legal pad he insisted on using. \u201cHe\u2019s had a few days to do some underground research, maybe find out things about you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sophia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve survived worse monsters.\u201d Her eyes met Max\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go in.\u201d</p><p>Every single muscle in his body went rock hard in rejection of the idea, but he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be right here\u2014one small signal and I come get you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia walked into the same room she\u2019d entered only a few days prior, but this time, she was viscerally aware of Max\u2019s gaze on her no matter that he stood hidden behind the wall that separated the room from the observation chamber. And though a prison guard stood with his back to the wall behind Bonner, it was the knowledge of Max watching over her that kept her calm, focused.</p><p>Her cop would never let the monster touch her.</p><p>With that knowledge in her heart, she said, \u201cMr. Bonner,\u201d as she reached the table.</p><p>Gerard Bonner\u2019s smile presumed an intimacy that made her skin crawl. \u201cSophia. I\u2019d rise to welcome you, but alas . . .\u201d He gestured to the clamps that kept him immobilized, his hands jerking to a halt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my protection that you can\u2019t move,\u201d she said, taking a seat across from him. \u201cYou have very strong hands.\u201d After torturing Carissa White in a multitude of horrific ways, he\u2019d finally killed her with the intimacy of his hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you attempting to shock me?\u201d A warm chuckle from the outwardly handsome man in front of her. \u201cI enjoyed it, you know. Poor Carissa. She begged me to do it in the end.\u201d</p><p>So clever, she thought, always couching his words in a way that it was never quite a confession. Not that they needed it, not for Carissa White. \u201cI was told you were ready to cooperate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I put you to too much inconvenience with my request?\u201d he asked, his expression filling with what many would\u2019ve mistaken for the sincerest of apologies. \u201cI find that I like you the best. You\u2019re so much . . . gentler than the other Js.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know, Mr. Bonner,\u201d she said conversationally, \u201cthat in the early part of this century, they still incarcerated males together in the same cell? Tell me\u201d\u2014she held his gaze, let him see that she\u2019d looked into the abyss, that nothing he said could touch her\u2014\u201cdo you think you would have . . . enjoyed\u201d\u2014a deliberate echo of his word, his tone\u2014\u201cbeing in a cell with another inmate who might not have shared your more sophisticated tastes?\u201d</p><p>Bonner didn\u2019t like that, his eyes showing the sadistic bite of malignant rage before he got it under control. \u201cI\u2019m sure I would have survived, Sophia. Hmm, does anyone call you Sophie?\u201d</p> <p>She hated that he\u2019d used Max\u2019s pet name for her, hated it so much that for an instant, she wondered if she\u2019d betrayed herself, because Bonner\u2019s blue eyes glinted with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou may call me anything you wish.\u201d A facsimile of calm, good enough that it had fooled the medics all these years. \u201cAll I care about are your memories.\u201d</p><p>Another crack in the facade, the ugliness inside him rising to the surface for a fleeting instant. \u201cThen take them, Sophie.\u201d Vicious words laced with charm. \u201cTake what you came to find . . . then maybe you can tell me how you got such a pretty, pretty face.\u201d</p><p>She did nothing, felt nothing. His words didn\u2019t matter\u2014not when Max saw her, knew her, accepted her. \u201cI\u2019m not going on some kind of a scavenger hunt in your brain, Mr. Bonner. If you want to cooperate, then cooperate. If not, I\u2019ll make a final recommendation that your offers to share information have been nothing but a waste of time and that all further approaches from you be ignored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d It was said in that same charming voice, his smile never slipping. \u201cIs the rest of your skin marked? Or are you a blank canvas just waiting for the right artist?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne last time, Mr. Bonner\u2014are you ready to cooperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She held the eye contact, sweeping out with her unique telepathic gift. Some Js needed physical contact with those they scanned, but she never had. And now, with her Sensitivity, touch would take her too deep, lock her into another\u2019s mind. And if there was one consciousness she did not want to be trapped within, it was that of the sociopath on the other side of the table.</p><p>Moving effortlessly through the easily permeable barrier that was the weakness of a human shield, she stepped into his mind. It was as calm, as orderly . . . but the pieces had shifted. Bonner was rearranging his memories of the past, perhaps to better fit his own personal view of the world.</p><p>A woman\u2019s screaming face, her back contorted in agony, her eyes bleeding at the corners. Sophia recoiled inside, but years of training kept her from betraying her abhorrence on her face. \u201cWe already know what you did to Carissa White,\u201d she said. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got\u2014\u201d</p><p>A small wooden glade, peaceful almost.</p> <p>She felt the handle of the shovel vibrate under her hands as he/they drove it into the earth, heard the eerie quiet, felt the cool crackle of the plastic under his/their hands as he/ they rolled the body into the shallowest of graves. Bonner didn\u2019t waste any time covering his victim up again, his/their actions as impersonal as if he/they were raising a garden. The body had ceased to have any meaning once it stopped screaming. Not long afterward, the earth covered the plastic, and then they were walking through the forest, exiting less than five minutes later onto a rugged track swathed in fog.</p><p>Firs\u2014deep green, thick with foliage\u2014their tips disappearing into the fine white mist, surrounded them on all sides, but there was a lot of undergrowth, a few spindly trees of other species. So not a tree farm, but something more natural. She got into the vehicle, started the engine after stripping off heavy gardening gloves. The four-wheel drive took the rickety road with ease, until half an hour later, she appeared out of the fog and found herself at a T-junction, a sealed road in front of her. Her heart was calm, her body relaxed. It was\u2014</p><p>Sophia realized she was losing herself in Bonner, fought to bring herself back. \u201cI need a location.\u201d She could see nothing but the infrequent car zipping by fast\u2014a lonely highway.</p><p>\u201cPatience, my sweet Sophia.\u201d Bonner was breathing hard, excited by the memory . . . by making her relive it with him.</p><p>That was when she saw it, the board on the left that marked the entrance to \u201cFog Valley Track.\u201d</p><p>She took note of the kinds of flowers she\u2019d seen, the angle of the sun, the weather, everything she could.</p><p>Then Bonner\u2019s memories shifted sideways, a twisting kaleidoscope.</p><p>She\u2019d expected something of the kind, pulled back before it could affect her. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give us much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find her.\u201d He drew a long, deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll find my lovely Gwyn.\u201d</p><p>Gwyneth Hayley had disappeared six months after Carissa White and was widely considered to be Bonner\u2019s second victim. Sophia tried to pry further details out of the Butcher, but he just smiled that intimate, satisfied little smile and told her she\u2019d have to do some of the work herself.</p><p>Exiting, she let the medic scan her. \u201cYou need nutrients,\u201d was the response.</p><p>She drank the energy drinks he gave her, then let Bartholomew Reuben lead them up out of the bowels of the building and to a conference room on the upper floor. \u201cIf everyone could drop their shields,\u201d Sophia said, \u201cI can project the scan into your minds.\u201d This was part of what made her a J, rather than a simple telepath\u2014the ability to literally project entire memories. She could only do five people at a time, but other than Max, there was only Reuben, the warden, and Reuben\u2019s assistant. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Detective Shannon, I can\u2019t project through your natural shield.\u201d</p><p>Max shrugged. \u201cProjecting is tough on a J, right?\u201d He continued without waiting for an answer, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give us a recap instead?\u201d His eyes were piercing. \u201cIf Bonner really is in a cooperative mood, we don\u2019t know how soon you might have to scan him again.\u201d</p><p>He was protecting her. The knowledge made her heart expand until it threatened to consume her. Taking a deep breath, holding that powerful emotion like the treasure it was, Sophia described what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cFog Valley Track,\u201d Max said, already on the phone to the computer techs at Enforcement. \u201cYeah, how many hits?\u201d A pause. \u201cNarrow it down to a location with a lot of firs, relatively isolated\u2014or it would\u2019ve been five years ago; maybe off a highway.\u201d</p><p>Sophia raised her hand to catch his attention. \u201cThe temperature was cool, though the position of the sun suggested it was close to midday.\u201d Her mind filtered out the distractions of the other cars, Bonner\u2019s thoughts, and saw through to the other side of the road. \u201cThere was a billboard advertising a harvest festival as he turned out of the track.\u201d</p><p>Max repeated her words to the computer tech, waited a few moments. \u201cI owe you a drink. Send everything through to D2, comm station three. And encrypt it, just in case someone\u2019s scanning the prison line.\u201d Hanging up, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got three mentions of a Fog Valley Track that might match,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe track was very rough,\u201d Sophia pointed out. \u201cCould be it\u2019s not on the maps at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A grim look. \u201cBut we\u2019ll worry about that after we check out these images.\u201d</p><p>Those images were transmitted moments later. Sophia said, \u201cThat one,\u201d almost before she was aware of opening her mouth.</p><p>Gwyneth Hayley\u2019s last resting place lay deep within a snow-capped mountain range.</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>Faith NightStar, daughter of Councilor Anthony Kyriakus and the most powerful foreseer in the world, walked out into the forest that surrounded the home she shared with her changeling mate, hoping the fresh air would melt away the fog that clouded her mind. Deep and viscous, damp and clammy, it felt almost real\u2014the chill of it making her rub her hands up and down her arms.</p><p>\u201cSomething bad is coming,\u201d she said out loud, trying to think past the thick gray soup that hid everything from view. \u201cFire and fog and screams and metal.\u201d They were all connected. The fog touched those in the center, but so did the flames and the stabbing, cutting violence of metal.</p><p>She began to pace restlessly across the pine needles that littered the forest floor, her gut twisted up with the knowledge that someone was going to die. Tears pricked her eyes, burned in her throat. \u201cFire and fog and screams and metal.\u201d</p><p>But no matter how many times she repeated that, no matter how many times she tried to part the fog, all she got was a crushing sense of impending horror.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>Evil does exist. It may not be listed in any official manual, may be considered an emotional construct, but as Js, you must accept that there will come a time when you will be faced by such malevolence that it will challenge all that you know, all that you believe you are.</p><p>\u2014Sophia Russo (J) to trainee Js (unofficial seminar held</p><p>at an undisclosed site)</p><p>Four hours after Sophia pinpointed the location, the entire team, complete with a forensic unit, got out of their vehicles at the forested end of Fog Valley Track. Though the ground was currently clear, the air up here carried a touch of ice, the threat of snow lingering in the air.</p><p>\u201cYou, me, and Bart,\u201d Max said to Sophia. \u201cWe go in, see if we can eyeball anything. If that fails, we send in the dogs.\u201d It was just nudging five, but the winter sunlight was fading fast. It would\u2019ve been more sensible to wait until the next day, but an unspoken thought united them all\u2014they couldn\u2019t bear to leave Gwyn alone and cold in the dark any longer.</p><p>Nodding, Sophia took the lead. \u201cThe undergrowth has gotten considerably thicker in the years since Bonner was here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt least the path\u2019s still negotiable,\u201d Bart said, pushing a branch out of his way as he and Max followed Sophia\u2019s shorter form. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a bitch to process though once we find the grave.\u201d</p><p>Max shot out a hand to grip Sophia\u2019s upper arm when she stumbled over a rock. \u201cThank you, Detective.\u201d A calm, even voice, but Max had felt the slight tremor in her muscles, knew his Sophie was hanging on through sheer, stubborn grit.</p><p>\u201cAnything look familiar?\u201d Dropping her arm, Max backed off, aware of Bart staring at him.</p> <p>\u201cNot so far.\u201d</p><p>Bart nudged Max, his voice low. \u201cYou know Psy don\u2019t like to be touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey also probably don\u2019t like to fall flat on their faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Blowing out a breath, Bart shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t called Gwyn\u2019s parents yet.\u201d The name fell easily from the prosecutor\u2019s tongue\u2014like Max, he\u2019d come to intimately know the short life and lost dreams of each and every girl.</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d Max said, remembering Gwyn\u2019s mile-wide smile, her long runner\u2019s legs, with an anger that hadn\u2019t dulled in the intervening years. \u201cNo use ripping the scab off that wound unless we can give them some peace.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia went motionless up ahead, her head angled toward a twisted old tree on the edge of the path. \u201cI saw that.\u201d It was almost soundless.</p><p>Max kept an eye on her as she stepped off the path and began to jog forward. Not more than five minutes into it, she jerked left and clambered onto a fallen log. But she didn\u2019t step off on the other side. Reaching her, Max jumped up on her right, as Bart did the same on her left.</p><p>There was no need to ask her what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the land died here,\u201d Sophia said, her eyes on the lifeless patch of earth in front of them, which though bordered by the living beat of the forest, tiny shoots and greenery, was itself as browned and dry as dust.</p><p>As if Gwyneth Hayley\u2019s lifeblood had soaked into the soil and turned it barren.</p><p>The forensic team worked deep into the night, under brilliant lamps. By midnight, they\u2019d found only seven discrete bones, the others in all probability having been carried away by forest creatures, but amazingly, one of those seven was the skull. And there were teeth still attached to that skull.</p> <p>A positive dental match was made on the spot using mobile equipment.</p><p>Sophia saw Max\u2019s shoulders shudder and drop the instant after the forensic technician made his pronouncement. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said to Bart Reuben.</p><p>Bart\u2019s face was drawn, his eyes full of old pain as he acquiesced. \u201cThey trust you more.\u201d</p><p>Letting the prosecutor walk past her and back to the site, Sophia went to stand beside Max as he moved away from the group and into the night-shadow of a giant tree with sweeping arms. \u201cYou\u2019re calling her family?\u201d</p><p>A nod, his face lined with angry sorrow. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to do it in person, but I have to make sure they get the information before it leaks to the media.\u201d His fingers clenched on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019ll tear them apart all over again.\u201d</p><p>Hidden in the darkness, she dared lay her hand on his arm. \u201cBut it will give them peace\u2014and Gwyneth a safe place to rest.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t reply, but he leaned into her touch. It threatened to shatter her.</p><p>Because Max Shannon was not a man who leaned on anyone.</p> <p>As she stood there beside him, he coded in a number from memory and raised the phone to his ear. And then he did what had to be done.</p><p>The next two days passed in a blur. Sophia had another comm-conference with Bonner. However, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to cooperate. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying my extra hour in the sun far too much,\u201d he told her. \u201cSo obliging of the prison authorities to stick to their bargain with me.\u201d</p><p>Knowing he\u2019d string them along now that he had their attention, she didn\u2019t squander her time and, instead, asked Max if there was anything she could do to assist him.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on the Nikita situation,\u201d he told her. \u201cGo over the forensic reports as they come in, compare the results sent in by Nikita\u2019s people against those of the independent lab we contracted.\u201d As the lead detective on the Bonner case, he wasn\u2019t only dealing with the families of the victims, but also the brass and the media; his eyes bloodshot with lack of sleep. \u201cDid we receive the report from the mechanic on the crashed car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She confirmed the computer was tampered with.\u201d Sophia wanted to touch him, give comfort in the human way, but they were in the hastily thrown together \u201cwar room\u201d\u2014located in the closest Enforcement station to where Gwyneth Hayley\u2019s body had been found. Activity buzzed on every side, crashing against her senses. \u201cThe second autopsy you ordered on the driver has also been completed. There were no drugs in Allison Marceau\u2019s system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense if the car was the weapon.\u201d He glanced quickly at the report. \u201cEven if she sent out a telepathic scream, it wouldn\u2019t have been noted as anything suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be better if I went back. I can deal with things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d It was a single quiet word, but it carried a thousand unsaid things.</p><p>Bound to him now by threads she didn\u2019t quite understand, but that had become the defining truths in her life, she stayed\u2014setting herself up in her hotel room, away from the constant storm of the war room.</p><p>To everyone\u2019s surprise, the Council dispatched several Ps-Psy to help with the search around what had been dubbed Bonner Site #1. \u201cPsychometrics sense the imprints of the past,\u201d Sophia explained to Max when he asked for a quick pr\u00e9cis. \u201cThey usually work verifying the age and provenance of works of art, other expensive objects\u2014but I\u2019ve heard it said that some can also pick up \u2018echoes\u2019 of events that took place in a particular location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a look at the title of the land,\u201d Max told her a few hours after the psychometrics arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s owned by a Psy conglomerate and earmarked for development.\u201d</p><p>That, Sophia thought, made much more sense. \u201cThey don\u2019t want any unanswered questions lowering the value of the land and subsequent development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it matters why they\u2019re here. Tanique\u201d\u2014he named one of the Ps-Psy\u2014\u201calready located two of Gwyneth\u2019s bones almost half a mile from the gravesite.\u201d</p><p>That was one of the few conversations they managed to have in the bleak, exhausting hours that followed. It was on their last night at the search base\u2014right after it was announced that no evidence of further bodies had been found within a mile-wide radius of the site\u2014that she discovered something interesting.</p><p>She\u2019d been digging deep into the backgrounds of all the individuals of interest, tapping her connections in Justice when necessary. The aristocratic Quentin Gareth came across as a ruthless businessman, but seemed otherwise clean. Andre Tulane, in contrast, had repeating weekly meetings that she could tie into nothing official, while the intern, Ryan Asquith, had a note on his file that meant he\u2019d been reconditioned within the past year as a result of a court order.</p><p>All merited further investigation, but the most interesting data resulted from a logarithm she\u2019d been running on news uploads at around the time of the killings: Councilor Kaleb Krychek had been in the relevant area at the time of every single murder. He\u2019d even been snapped by the San Francisco Gazette\u2014leaving an early morning meeting with Nikita\u2014on the day Edward Chan had a knife thrust into his heart.</p><p>\u201cIt ties up so neatly\u2014but at the same time, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said to Max the next day as she finished locking up her bag for the return trip to San Francisco. With the families of all the victims having been notified of what was happening behind the scenes with Bonner, and with no hope of finding any further remains, Max had decided they needed to turn their attention back to Nikita\u2019s situation.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Krychek a telekinetic?\u201d Max asked, shadows under his eyes from the lack of sleep.</p><p>\u201cExactly\u2014and he\u2019s teleport capable.\u201d It hurt her to see him hurting\u2014she couldn\u2019t wait until they were home, where she could wrap her arms around him, give him the surcease he\u2019d given her so many times. \u201cHe would\u2019ve been smart enough to teleport in to do the kills while he wasn\u2019t officially known to be in the region.\u201d</p><p>Taking her bag and slinging his own duffel over his shoulder, Max headed to the elevators as she pulled the door to her hotel room closed. \u201cFrom what I know of Councilor Krychek,\u201d he said as she came to stand beside him, \u201che\u2019s a stone-cold operator. I can\u2019t see him wasting time with the theater of a fake suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a confirmation, but there are constant whispers that he was raised by a sociopath, that he\u2019s a murderer at heart.\u201d She\u2019d seen Krychek once\u2014on the other side of a hotel lobby\u2014but his presence had made her alter her route, take the long way to her destination in order to avoid him. It had been self-preservation, the otherness in her recognizing an intelligence as lethal\u2014and far, far colder.</p><p>Max rubbed his hand over the jaw she\u2019d watched him shave a few minutes ago when she\u2019d gone into his room ostensibly to talk about the case. The experience had been starkly, beautifully intimate. \u201cThe pattern\u2019s too political for a serial killer,\u201d he said, waiting until she stepped into the elevator before following. \u201cThat kind of a sociopathic drive wouldn\u2019t have allowed him to keep his urges leashed to the extent of only committing murders on the verge of a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another rumor that might be more apropos,\u201d Sophia said, curling her fingers into her palms to keep from touching the smooth skin of his jaw, breathing in the fresh pine of his aftershave. \u201dThat Nikita and Krychek have some kind of an alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that fits the pattern,\u201d Max murmured as the doors opened at the garage level. Heading to the vehicle they\u2019d rented at the airport, a vehicle that had spent the entirety of the past forty-eight hours sitting in the garage\u2014Max having had access to an Enforcement car, while Sophia remained in the hotel to work\u2014he dumped their bags in the trunk. \u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to cause suspicion between the two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo\u2014\u201d She was cut off by the beeping of her cell phone. Pulling it out, she said, \u201cSophia Russo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God I caught you\u2014Max\u2019s phone won\u2019t go through.\u201d It was an unfamiliar voice, trembling as if the speaker had run a hundred miles. \u201cThis is Faith NightStar.\u201d</p><p>Getting into the car when Max opened the door for her, Sophia immediately realized the reason for the call. \u201cYou had a vision.\u201d And the visions of a cardinal F-Psy were accurate to within a hundredth of a decimal point.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Faith said as Max snapped on his safety belt and went to put his thumbprint on the starter. \u201cThe car is rigged. Do you understand?\u201d Frantic words. \u201cDon\u2019t start the engine.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s thumb brushed the ignition switch.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Sophia jerked Max\u2019s hand away from the ignition with a wrench that had his head snapping toward her.</p><p>\u201cSophia!\u201d Faith\u2019s voice merged with Max\u2019s demand to know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said to Faith, tremors shaking her frame. \u201cWe\u2019re both fine. Here, you better speak directly to Max.\u201d</p> <p>Leaning back in her seat, she tried to get her heart to beat in a normal rhythm as Max had a short, sharp discussion with Faith. Closing the phone, he ordered her to step out of the car. Neither of them said a word until they were standing in front of the innocuous-looking vehicle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the bomb squad,\u201d Max said, using her cell phone to make the call when his own proved to have a flat battery. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here in five minutes, tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d She had to focus on the mundane, on the practical . . . rather than on the fact that Max had come terrifyingly close to death.</p><p>Max touched her lightly on the back, and she realized just how much she\u2019d missed the contact in the frenetic pace of the past two days. No one had ever told her that touch was something you became addicted to, the loss of it a hunger, an ache deep within.</p><p>\u201cThey work out of the same Enforcement building we used as a base.\u201d His hand dropped away as an Enforcement vehicle drove into the garage. \u201cStill, that was damn fast.\u201d</p><p>Two men and one woman stepped out, all three in the protective gear of the bomb squad. \u201cTell me what you know,\u201d the woman said.</p> <p>\u201cWe got the heads-up from an F-Psy\u2014\u201d Max began.</p><p>\u201cForeseer?\u201d The woman whistled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize they made civilian predictions\u2014heard it was all business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith NightStar,\u201d Max said. \u201cShe\u2019s part of DarkRiver. She saw the car explode after I started the engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Given current technology, it\u2019s got to be some kind of a detonation message being sent to the actual device.\u201d She was already moving toward the car, equipment in hand. \u201cYou two might want to clear the garage. You\u2019re not wearing protective gear.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded to the entrance ramp. \u201cWe\u2019ll be waiting outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a yell soon as we locate anything.\u201d</p><p>Faith paced across the beautifully lighted cave that was her home office, rubbing her hands up and down her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou cold, sweetheart?\u201d</p> <p>Looking up, she found Vaughn in the doorway. Her jaguar had a streak of white dust on his face, a rip near the bottom of his T-shirt, and was so wonderful she still couldn\u2019t believe he was hers. \u201cNo.\u201d But she walked into his embrace. \u201cHold me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His arms came around her, strong and warm, one hand gripping a chisel he\u2019d clearly been using on his current sculpture. \u201cI thought you said the cop and his J were all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d She ran her fingers over the gritty dust that covered the skin of his arm. \u201cBut I still have this knowing that something bad is coming.\u201d She hated the amorphous knowings even more than the dark visions. At least the visions showed her something concrete, something she could fight or avert. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional knowing\u2014connected to someone who\u2019s important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you try the exercises you\u2019ve been working on to fine-tune your control over your abilities?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, sliding her hands under his T-shirt and to the muscled warmth of his back. \u201cI can\u2019t break through the veil. And Vaughn, it\u2019s something really, really bad.\u201d Ice filled her heart, coated her veins. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t stop it?\u201d What if she lost one of the people she loved?</p><p>Vaughn pressed his lips to her brow. \u201cWe discussed this. You\u2019ll go mad if you take responsibility for every evil you can\u2019t stop.\u201d His tone was gentle but absolute. \u201cYou saved two lives today. Celebrate that.\u201d</p><p>Raising her head, she met those golden eyes\u2014eyes of a jungle cat made human\u2014that had become the fulcrum of her universe. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d And part of the reason why so many F-Psy had gone irrevocably mad in the past\u2014that need to save every life, avert every sorrow, could devour the unwary.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have me.\u201d Lips against her own, intense protectiveness in the way his body curved over hers. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get you into a better frame of mind.\u201d And then her jaguar was purring low in his throat as he peeled off her clothes. \u201cIt\u2019ll come to you if you\u2019re relaxed.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart lighten with sensual humor. Oh, how she needed him. His ability to play, to laugh, to love, made every darkness bearable. \u201cSo you\u2019re stripping me naked for my benefit?\u201d</p><p>A look so innocent, it would\u2019ve done one of Tammy\u2019s rambunctious twins proud. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Faith let him love her, let him comfort her . . . and hoped it would break open the deadlock on her mind. Because whatever was coming, it was a crushing, terrifying blackness that only ever meant one thing.</p><p>Death.</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>We don\u2019t choose our parents. And their mistakes aren\u2019t our own. You are what you make yourself\u2014don\u2019t ever forget that.</p><p>\u2014Max Shannon in reply to an e-mail from the sole</p><p>survivor of the Castleton murder-suicide</p><p>Sophia allowed herself to lean against the garage wall once they\u2019d exited onto the quiet street outside. She wasn\u2019t concerned about setting off alarm bells if caught on surveillance\u2014even Psy sometimes lost the perfect posture that had been drilled into them as a symptom and indication of control.</p><p>Max braced himself with one arm on the wall beside her, his eyes ablaze though he kept his distance. His earlier touch everyone would discount as a human action inspired by the emotions of the moment. But if he touched her now, Sophia knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist crumbling into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Rough tone, violence contained.</p><p>She wanted so much to crawl into his arms, to hold the solid reality of him to her until she believed he was alive, was safe. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lines bracketed Max\u2019s mouth. \u201cThis has to be connected to the work we\u2019re doing for Nikita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Realizing that he was focusing his anger into work, she kicked her sluggish brain into gear. \u201cBonner is very wealthy, and Bartholomew said that he has many groupies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have his visitor logs and mail records checked out. But fact is, he likes playing with you\u2014I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have you killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has no way of knowing I\u2019m working with you on another case,\u201d she said, her hands clammy inside her gloves, her heartbeat erratic, \u201cespecially if this particular plan was put in motion before we met. He considers you his adversary, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d She\u2019d seen the notes, notes Bonner had sent to Max while he\u2019d still been an unknown serial killer. Each had been a taunt, a declaration of his superiority.</p><p>But then Max had caught him.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Blowing out a breath, Max clenched his fist against the wall, the rough texture of the plascrete rubbing against his skin. He wanted nothing more than to grab Sophia and drag her to his chest, to crush her close until the thudding fear of his heartbeat decreased to something less agonizing.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d a soft word, a warning from a J with eyes full of remembered terror.</p><p>Shoving his other hand into a pocket to stop himself from reaching for her, he said, \u201cBonner likes to get up close and personal.\u201d</p><p>Sophia nodded, her hair lifting in the breeze that sent a discarded soft-drink bottle rolling down the otherwise empty street. \u201cYes, a bomb is something more apt to be used by those of my race\u2014especially if the aim was expediency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what the bomb squad has to say.\u201d</p><p>They had to wait fifteen more minutes before the squad called an all-clear, having removed the device and placed it into a blast-proof container. \u201cHigh tech,\u201d the female member of the team said. \u201cNothing your average malcontent could make on his own.\u201d</p><p>Max hunkered down beside her, aware of the two males giving Sophia the once-over. If they so much as smiled wrong in her direction, those faces would be hitting the old-fashioned concrete of the garage floor\u2014he was not in a rational mood right now. \u201cSomeone wealthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. The rich can source anything, but they\u2019d have to have some fairly strong contacts\u2014this stuff is Defense grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it from a Psy company?\u201d Sophia came to stand so close beside him, he could\u2019ve reached out and curved his hand around the smooth temptation of her calf. Though he forced himself not to touch, her proximity soothed the clawing edge of his protectiveness.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t tell from a surface look, but they\u2019re the leaders in explosive technology, so I\u2019m guessing yeah.\u201d She locked the box. \u201cYou want me to call forensics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Rising, he said good-bye to the bomb experts just as two uniformed officers arrived to hold the scene secure. \u201cDetective Chen is on her way,\u201d one of them said.</p><p>Grabbing Chen\u2019s number from them, Max made a call to her, then one to Bart, telling him of the incident and asking him to have his people go over Bonner\u2019s mail and visitor records. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll organize it,\u201d Bart said. \u201cGlad you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Ending the call, Max made another one asking for a ride to the airport.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we stay for the investigation?\u201d Sophia asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo point.\u201d Max wanted Sophia out of here, wanted her safe. \u201cI know Chen, and she\u2019s a hell of a detective. She\u2019ll keep us in the loop if they discover something\u2014and she\u2019s okay with taking our statements over a comm link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if this is connected to Nikita rather than Bonner,\u201d Sophia said, \u201cthen we need to be in San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because even Psy sure as hell wouldn\u2019t attempt to blow up a cop five minutes from an Enforcement station unless they were planning something damn spectacular. Either we\u2019ve gotten too close to something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014or we were meant to be a distraction,\u201d Sophia completed.</p><p>The question was\u2014Who or what target was important enough to chance taking out a cop? The fact that he was human didn\u2019t negate the danger\u2014all politics aside, Enforcement command would take the murder of one of its officers as a personal attack.</p> <p>Sascha grinned as Lucas stopped at a small corner shop to buy her an ice cream. \u201cThank you, Mr. Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Sascha darling.\u201d He shook his head as they pulled away from the store. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it all goes.\u201d</p><p>She took a contented bite of her chocolate-coated chocolate ice cream. \u201cDon\u2019t make me mad.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cI think you\u2019ve fulfilled your quota of crazy today.\u201d</p><p>She made a face at him, able to hear the cat\u2019s humor in his voice. \u201cThere is no quota, not once you start carrying around a bowling ball in your belly.\u201d A little pat to reassure the baby, who appeared to be fast asleep. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t adore our little bowling ball.\u201d</p><p>A fond glance from the cat beside her. \u201cWhy are we going into work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause they need you to sign documents.\u201d Savoring the delicious treat, she sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a drive through the Presidio before we head in,\u201d he said, referring to the forested region just outside the city. \u201cYou can find a nice sunny spot to eat your ice cream while I take a nap.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a laughing glance, warmth filling her body at the remembrance of exactly why he was so sleep-deprived. \u201cAre you complaining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\u2014a wicked smile\u2014\u201cI\u2019m planning my revenge.\u201d</p><p>Max and Sophia had gone over every piece of evidence related to Nikita\u2019s case twice by the time they were twenty minutes into their flight. \u201cWhat are we missing?\u201d Max muttered, frustrated at the feeling that they were being blind to something critically important. Bonner and his twisted games just didn\u2019t fit.</p><p>The vanilla of Sophia\u2019s shampoo whispered across his senses as she bent her head over her organizer, an invisible caress. \u201cWhatever it is, it must be taking place soon if they came after us in such a high-risk location.\u201d They\u2019d both realized the bomb could\u2019ve been planted anytime in the past forty-eight hours. Which meant\u2014\u201cWe have to work on the assumption that the timeline has to be very, very short by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA strike anytime soon will break the pattern of murders before a big deal.\u201d Max had spoken to Nikita prior to boarding the airjet, reconfirmed that nothing was even close to final. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s made them push their schedule forward.\u201d Her thigh brushed his.</p> <p>The fleeting touch was a balm, centering him. \u201cNikita\u2019s people\u2014anyone who\u2019ll be out of easy reach for a long period?\u201d</p><p>Sophia tapped the screen of her organizer with quick motions. \u201cPrague, Berlin, Tokyo, hardly out-of-the-way locations. And any who are going are coming back within a week or two at most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be an issue of access,\u201d Max muttered. \u201cAnd for some reason, they were worried we\u2019d figure it out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Max.\u201d Sophia\u2019s eyes turned an intense, incredible night violet. \u201cThey were worried you would figure it out\u2014you\u2019re the wild card in this situation, a human whose thought processes they can\u2019t predict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so a target a Psy wouldn\u2019t immediately think of, coupled with a deadly\u2014\u201d Ice crawled through his veins, right to his heart. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did I see it?\u201d Reaching into the seat pocket in front of them, he pulled out the entertainment module. \u201cThey were flashing the selections on the big screen when we boarded, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d He stopped on the front page of a national tabloid. The headline was: Scoop! Sascha Duncan Pregnant! Below that was another headline in a slightly smaller font: DarkRiver Alpha Keeps Pregnant Mate Captive!</p><p>Max put down the module. \u201cBastards are afraid the cats really are about to put Sascha into hiding.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling bloomed in the pit of Sophia\u2019s stomach as she remembered the glowing warmth of Sascha\u2019s presence. The E-Psy was something incredibly good, something their race needed to protect, not harm. \u201cOur cell phones won\u2019t work.\u201d As a result of accidents in the twentieth century, all devices were now automatically blocked while an airjet was in the sky.</p><p>Max was already rising. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the steward, get an emergency call out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cThat\u2019ll take too long. I\u2019ll do it on the PsyNet.\u201d Though she was a very strong telepath, her shields were viciously degraded. If she attempted to send that far without the aid of the Net, they could collapse, killing her before the message reached the intended recipient.</p><p>\u201cYou do it on the Net, I\u2019ll make the call, cover our bases.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she closed her eyes to ensure total focus and opened her psychic eye. She hadn\u2019t tried to cross her new shields before today, but if they were hers, they should obey her\u2014and they did, wrapping her in distinctive mobile firewalls as she exited out into the PsyNet.</p><p>Forcing herself to ignore the battering influx of information that was the endless river of the Net, she arrowed straight to Nikita\u2019s mind. As expected, the Councilor\u2019s shields were beyond impenetrable, but Sophia began to try to break them. It was the easiest way to ensure she\u2019d get Nikita\u2019s attention as fast as possible.</p><p>It only took a split second. \u201cMs. Russo.\u201d Nikita\u2019s icy presence. \u201cPeople who attempt to hack my shields don\u2019t usually survive.\u201d</p><p>Sophia knew full well she\u2019d risked infection from a mental virus if the Councilor had laced her defenses with her own personal brand of poison. \u201cYou need to get a message to Sascha. We think she\u2019s the next target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing concrete\u2014but it\u2019ll happen very soon.\u201d</p><p>Nikita broke contact.</p><p>Dropping out of the Net, Sophia found that she was gripping the armrests so tight, her tendons showed white against her skin.</p><p>\u201cSophie, sweetheart, talk to me.\u201d It was a soft-voiced command, meant to carry to her ears alone as Max returned to slide into his seat.</p><p>\u201cI told Nikita.\u201d She swallowed, realizing something too late. \u201cI just hope she was the right person to tell.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>One thing I\u2019ve learned after so many years on the job\u2014no one is simple, no one is one-dimensional. And still, people surprise me.</p><p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p><p>Sascha\u2019s and Lucas\u2019s phones both started beeping with the pack\u2019s emergency code when they were two streets over from the HQ. Then the car phone started beeping.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Lucas double-parked beside a bright magenta monstrosity that Sascha had been teasing him about buying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get mine,\u201d Sascha was saying when she felt a telepathic knock on her mind. Firm, familiar. Mother. Her own telepathic reach was small, but Nikita\u2019s was so wide, she\u2019d hear Sascha\u2019s weaker voice.</p><p>You may have been chosen as a target by my enemies.</p><p>I understand.</p><p>The methods they\u2019ve used thus far suggest they do not have a teleport-capable telekinetic at their disposal.</p><p>I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m careful about my physical surroundings.</p><p>Don\u2019t forget about explosives.</p><p>No.</p><p>I\u2019ll organize protection\u2014</p><p>Thank you, Mother, Sascha said, emotion a rock in her throat, but the pack will take care of me. I promise.</p><p>Very well.</p><p>Nikita\u2019s mind dropped away, but Sascha didn\u2019t take it for disapproval. Glancing at Lucas, she saw his green eyes had gone cat. \u201cMy mother just warned me I might be a target,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were \u2019pathing to someone.\u201d Starting up the car, he turned back the way they\u2019d come, heading out of the city and toward their cabin. \u201cFaith had a vision\u2014that was your phone. Dorian cornered a sniper on his security rounds\u2014that was my phone. And Clay got a call from Max before his own informants told him about another suspicious man in the apartment building facing the HQ\u2014that was the car phone.\u201d</p><p>Sascha blew out a breath. \u201cDarling, you do realize that means the baby and I were never in any danger?\u201d</p><p>Lucas squeezed the steering wheel as if he\u2019d like to rip it off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to calm down for a while, so deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, she rubbed the back of her hand over his cheek. \u201cSince we\u2019re going home, I\u2019ll have lots of privacy to pet you.\u201d A nudge in her stomach, a thump in her heart. \u201cAnd you can pet me back.\u201d</p><p>The leopard shot her a quick glance.</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve hurt you, too.\u201d How dare they!</p><p>Lucas took her hand, brought it to her lips. \u201cThe pack would\u2019ve never let that happen.\u201d</p><p>The cunning way her leopard had turned her words back on her when it suited him thrust past the anger to leave only a deep need to touch, to love, to cherish. \u201cTake me home, Lucas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max called Lucas the instant they landed. \u201cShe\u2019s safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both fine\u2014you the reason Nikita knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie managed to pass on a message through the PsyNet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClay and Dorian have some intel out at our HQ that you should see\u2014probably shouldn\u2019t come over the comm lines.\u201d A long, indrawn breath. \u201cAnd, Cop\u2014thanks.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Max nodded to Sophie. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. And we might have a lead.\u201d He waited only until they were inside the car before reaching over to close his hand over her thigh, his palm separated from her skin by nothing but the material of her skirt. He understood exactly how feral the DarkRiver alpha was feeling at that moment. If Faith hadn\u2019t warned them about the bomb . . . \u201cI want to strip you to the skin and drive into you until we both scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>It took him three minutes of teeth-gritting control before he could begin driving. Neither of them said another word until they walked into the DarkRiver building. Clay met them in the lobby and led them upstairs to a meeting room, where Dorian was waiting.</p><p>The sentinel with his blue-eyed, blond good looks raised a hand. \u201cHere\u2019s the lowdown\u2014the assassin I found ate some kind of a fucking suicide tablet. I haven\u2019t seen anything like it outside of historical dramas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI worked a case where a small cult committed suicide en masse,\u201d Max said, his mind cascading with bleak images of small bodies curled up beside larger ones that should\u2019ve protected, not harmed. \u201cThey used a wine laced with poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt speaks of fanatical devotion,\u201d his J said, \u201crather than professionalism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was a professional, too.\u201d Dorian showed them some images on the comm screen. \u201cHis gear, the way he\u2019d been waiting there long enough to have left DNA behind, if you know what I mean\u2014the man knew what he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the body?\u201d</p><p>Clay was the one who responded. \u201cEnforcement morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other one?\u201d Max asked.</p> <p>The sentinel looked disgusted. \u201cHe figured out we were on to him and rabbited. I had to bring him down in a public area\u2014Enforcement was there within a minute. He\u2019s sitting in a cell not talking right now. No doubt he\u2019s Psy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d Dorian picked up what looked like a business card off the table. \u201cThis was left behind in the room where the second sniper was hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s evidence.\u201d Max scowled. \u201cYou\u2019ve fucking contaminated the hell out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Dorian said, \u201cyou don\u2019t want that in the system. And we processed it.\u201d</p><p>Max glanced down to see that the card carried a single line of text\u2014what looked like a comm code. Turning it over, he read the handwritten note: Sascha, DR HQ</p><p>\u201cI recognize that code,\u201d Sophia said in a quiet voice. \u201cIt\u2019s Councilor Duncan\u2019s private line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well guarded,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cAnd available only to a select few.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head. \u201cNikita isn\u2019t behind this. And the handwriting\u2014the time\u2019s missing.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia took it from his hand. \u201cThey were going to insert that once they\u2019d hit Sascha, make it seem as if Nikita had given them the location and time.\u201d She placed the card back on the table. \u201cBut the fact that they have this number further implicates someone in Nikita\u2019s inner circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother Councilor would also have it\u2014or be able to get it,\u201d Max said, eyes narrowed. \u201cNo question that Nikita has a mole inside her organization, but there\u2019s a much larger power behind this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got our informants on alert for anything that might be related.\u201d Clay said with a tightly held fury. \u201cYou need us, we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Max tapped the card. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>Dorian\u2019s scowl did nothing to lessen the sheer beauty of his face. \u201cOnly usable print was\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014Nikita\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey really thought you were going to fall for that?\u201d Max had seen the way the cats operated\u2014they were highly intelligent predators.</p><p>Dorian\u2019s mouth went grim. \u201cIf they\u2019d succeeded in hurting Sascha, we wouldn\u2019t have been thinking too straight. The leopard would\u2019ve gone for blood.\u201d</p><p>And, Sophia realized with a chill in her heart, the ensuing carnage would have begun a war.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>Nikita thought long and hard about her next move, considered, too, what it might betray. Nothing. If she was careful.</p><p>Picking up her cell phone, she input a code.</p><p>Anthony Kyriakus answered after a few seconds. \u201cNikita, this is unexpected.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Nikita thought, it was. Though they occupied the same basic area of the state, their paths rarely collided. The NightStar empire was built around the foreseeing abilities so prevalent in their genetic line, while Nikita\u2019s own company had a much more prosaic base in housing and design. But\u2014\u201cWe do have certain commonalities.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cIs this a Council matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That left them with only one common thread, a thread they\u2019d never before discussed. \u201cSascha was targeted by my enemies today. You may wish to ensure Faith\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing this out of the goodness of your heart.\u201d</p><p>Nikita had no heart. What she had were brains and a survival instinct that saw nothing wrong with killing, manipulation, and betrayal. But she wasn\u2019t fickle. That was bad for business. \u201cIt strikes me,\u201d she said, \u201cthat our aims have coincided more often than not in Council matters of late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allied to Krychek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d It was, she knew, less of an alliance than she had with Kaleb, but it existed. \u201cThey are attempting to take our territory, Anthony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s their mistake.\u201d And, for the first time, she heard the pure steel that had made Anthony Kyriakus a threat long before he became Council.</p><p>CHAPTER 31</p><p>To my Cop\u2014I never imagined you could exist, that you would exist, for someone like me. I never imagined that you\u2019d look at me the way you do. I never imagined how hard it would be to say good-bye.</p><p>\u2014Sophia Russo in an encrypted and time-coded letter to</p><p>be sent to Max Shannon after her death</p><p>The main Enforcement station in San Francisco was a sprawling complex full to the brim with humanity\u2014and at present, a Psy assassin.</p><p>Sophia took a deep breath as they were led down through the bull pen and to the short-term holding facilities at the back of the station. So many voices, so many people, so many memories and dreams\u2014it was a ceaseless buzz in her head, her shields already strained after the time spent in the enclosed space of the airjet.</p><p>Though she kept her arms tight to her body, her face turned away, people still bumped into her. She\u2019d managed to avoid skin-to-skin contact so far\u2014mostly because Max had been using his own body to shield hers in the most subtle of ways, but it was impossible to do anything but grit her teeth against the onslaught of psychic noise.</p><p>Hopes and wishes. Hates and loves. Joys and sorrows.</p><p>Even though she couldn\u2019t read any specific thoughts, she could feel the colossal weight of those thoughts battering at her. The pressure against her shields was immense\u2014she was terrified it would create a break, crushing her under an avalanche of other people\u2019s nightmares.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d The cop who\u2019d escorted them stopped in front of a cell. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Max held out his hand. \u201cI appreciate the cooperation.\u201d</p><p>The cop shook it, but his eyes were flat. \u201cYou have Psy backing. Call me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>White lines bracketed Max\u2019s mouth as the other man walked away. She wanted to comfort him, but what could she say? She was Psy, part of the very race whose history of arrogance meant Max was being seen as a traitor to his own people.</p><p>His gaze met hers at that moment and something in him seemed to ease. Walking up to the old-fashioned steel bars of the temporary holding cell, he said, \u201cKeeping your mouth shut isn\u2019t going to achieve anything, not while you\u2019re in Nikita\u2019s territory.\u201d</p><p>The man sitting on a bunk on one side of the room didn\u2019t so much as turn his head. Max tried again. With the same result. Shifting to glance at her, Max raised an eyebrow. She took a step closer to the bars. \u201cFanaticism,\u201d she said, keeping her tone clear, Silent, pure, \u201cis a breach of Silence.\u201d</p><p>No response, but she knew he was listening.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that your colleague committed suicide when he was of sound mind and body speaks to that fanaticism.\u201d</p><p>The man lifted his head. \u201cIt could as well have been a tactical decision to deprive the enemy of an individual to interrogate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t follow that path,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou didn\u2019t agree with his actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201d Cool words. \u201cIt\u2019s no crime to be in an apartment in San Francisco. Even one with a view of the DarkRiver building.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wondered if the male had truly thought through the consequences of his actions. Legalese wouldn\u2019t save him, not when he\u2019d proven himself part of the conspiracy against Nikita. Stepping back, she lowered her voice so that it would carry only to Max.</p><p>\u201cNikita doesn\u2019t know yet.\u201d That much was apparent because if she had, this man\u2019s mind would\u2019ve been torn apart like so much paper before they\u2019d ever had a chance to talk to him.</p><p>Max set his jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t care who the fuck she is\u2014she does that, I\u2019m done with this case. They can blow her up for all I care.\u201d</p><p>Nikita would bide her time, Sophia thought. Because right now, she needed Max. \u201cDo you want to attempt further questioning while I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The scream was sharp, high pitched. Even as the medical alarms began blaring, the Psy male fell forward and to the floor, his body flopping about in the throes of a seizure that had his head thumping over and over against the plascrete floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max had run to grab the guard with the key the instant after the first scream, but Sophia knelt by the bars, her heart twisting in pity. The would-be assassin\u2019s face was contorted, blood leaking out of his ears, and there, in those final moments, Sophia saw fear fill his soul. Reaching through the bars, she gripped the hand that flailed toward her. \u201cHold on, help is coming.\u201d</p><p>His hand spasmed on hers, pulling down her glove.</p><p>And he touched one finger to the skin bared at her wrist.</p> <p>A scream of sound, images and thought, yesterdays tangled up in dying agonies.</p><p>Someone\u2014Max\u2014wrenched back her hand. \u201cSophia!\u201d</p><p>She blinked, desperately trying to control the ugly roiling in her stomach. \u201cHelp him.\u201d It came out husky, rough.</p><p>Max shook his head, his eyes solemn. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Following his gaze, she saw another Enforcement officer inside with the prisoner, his head bowed in defeat. The Psy male\u2019s eyes stared unseeing at the ceiling.</p> <p>Nikita was adamant she hadn\u2019t killed the man. \u201cHe was eliminated to prevent me from discovering what he knew,\u201d she said when they confronted her. \u201cIf I had taken his mind, ripped away his secrets, I\u2019d have no more use for you and Ms. Russo, Detective\u2014and I\u2019d make sure you knew it.\u201d</p><p>Sophia watched Max hold that chilling gaze. \u201cNow that, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if I\u2019d been notified at the start.\u201d</p><p>It was true. Because she\u2019d have done the job herself.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>And right then, Sophia was too numb to consider anything further. She felt battered and bruised by the time they arrived back home. She didn\u2019t make the slightest protest when Max ushered her into his apartment rather than her own. \u201cGo take a hot shower,\u201d he ordered, nudging her toward the bedroom and the bathroom that flowed off it. \u201cI\u2019ll make you something to eat.\u201d</p> <p>She felt her lower lip tremble and it was such a strange sensation that she stared at him, uncomprehending.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart.\u201d Soft words, a gentle tone as he walked her into the bedroom and turned her in the direction of the bathroom door with his hands on her shoulders, careful to keep his fingers away from her skin.</p><p>He was taking care of her, she thought, her shocked state leaving her without defenses of any kind. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person who\u2019s ever taken care of me.\u201d Even before her parents had rejected her, she\u2019d been nothing but a practical responsibility.</p><p>Max went very, very still behind her. Then, releasing a long breath, he leaned in close enough that their breaths mingled. \u201cYeah?\u201d A slow smile. \u201cI guess that makes me a lucky man.\u201d Moving to face her, he tugged at her arms until she lowered them from around her waist. Then he pulled off her jacket. \u201cBaby, if I strip you, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be able to keep on being noble.\u201d</p><p>Something snapped awake inside of her, electrified at the idea of Max seeing her naked. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Shifting back, Max took out something from the closet. \u201cYou can put this on after.\u201d</p><p>It was, she saw, one of his shirts. She could\u2019ve as easily asked him to go into her apartment and retrieve some of her own clothing, but she took the shirt . . . took the scent of Max into her hands. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spare towel on the rail. Leave the door open,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the living room\u2014I want to be sure I hear you if you call out.\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t find the words she wanted to say, so she forced her feet forward and into the bathroom. Leaving the door ajar, she listened to the sounds of Max moving about in the bedroom as he changed. By the time she peeled off her clothing and stepped into the shower, she no longer felt so close to breaking. Still, there was a new fragility inside of her, a new fracture in her innermost psychic shields.</p><p>I can\u2019t break, she thought to herself, obdurate in her anger, her need, not yet. I haven\u2019t lived yet.</p><p>Turning off the shower only after her skin was pink from the heat, she got out and used the spare towel to dry herself, then picked up Max\u2019s shirt and brought it up to her nose. It had been laundered, but she could sense echoes of Max\u2019s innate scent beneath the freshness of the detergent.</p><p>It slipped easily over her body, hanging to midthigh. The color was white, but the fabric was thick enough that she didn\u2019t have to worry about her lack of underwear being embarrassingly obvious. Not that Max wouldn\u2019t already be aware that she was naked beneath his shirt. Feeling her cheeks color, she put her dirty clothes\u2014and gloves\u2014in a neat pile to the side, then stepped out into the bedroom.</p><p>It was empty.</p><p>Glad for the reprieve, she found herself walking to the dresser. A plain black comb lay on the surface, along with a wallet and a keycard. The austere nature of it suited him, she thought, because for all his masculine beauty, Max was a cop through and through. Taking the comb, she lifted it up to her hair. It felt wonderfully intimate to run it through the damp strands, and she imagined what it would be like to have him stroke her scalp with those strong fingers of his instead.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she dropped the comb on the dresser, turning to find him leaning against the doorjamb. He\u2019d changed into faded blue jeans and a plain black T-shirt that caressed his lithe frame with soft ease. \u201cYou look so young,\u201d she said. With his hair sliding over his forehead and his expression outwardly relaxed, he could\u2019ve been a college kid . . . but there was too much knowledge in those uptilted eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking.\u201d With that, he pushed away from the doorjamb and closed the distance between them with that inherently masculine grace. \u201cYou look good in my shirt.\u201d</p><p>She tugged at the cuffs she\u2019d rolled up to her wrists, nervous in a way she couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cMax, I\u2014\u201d The words stuck in her throat, hard, jagged.</p><p>Eyes of near black met hers as he bent his knees to bring himself down to her height. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>The dam burst. \u201cWill you hold me, Max?\u201d</p><p>Max stepped closer. \u201cAlways. But are you sure? Your shie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His arms came around her, gently, so gently, as if he was afraid she\u2019d shatter. But when she locked her own around his waist in an iron-tight embrace, his hold turned unbreakable. The electricity of their contact arced through her, but beneath it all was a tranquil, pure silence.</p><p>A sigh rippled out of her, as she found sweet relief from the unremitting pressure of the millions of minds in the vicinity, the billions of thoughts pressing down on her. When Max shifted his embrace to cup the back of her head, she shuddered.</p><p>He froze. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I feel is you,\u201d she whispered against his body, the warmth of him making her want to rub her face against him, rub her skin against him until he was a part of her. \u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d A husky question.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Bending his head, he touched his lips to her temple, one of his arms moving up to curve around her shoulders, his fingers tangling in her hair. She expected him to speak, but what he did instead was drop a line of kisses along her cheekbone and down over her jaw. Shivering from the sensation, from the near-painful pleasure of the contact, she stood on tiptoe, trying to get closer. A raw male chuckle.</p><p>And then Max kissed her.</p><p>This was no brush, no teasing taste. He took her mouth with the contained intensity she could feel thrumming beneath her fingers, his muscles taut, his entire body held barely in check. And she realized he was savagely angry, a tiger no longer on the leash.</p><p>His tongue swept against hers, buckling her knees. She gripped his shoulders, tried to hang on, drowning in the dark, masculine taste of him. Her heart was a rapid beat within her rib cage, her mind a place of splintering chaos. The only anchor, the only reality, was Max. His shoulder muscles shifting beneath her grasp, he moved one arm down to clamp over her lower back, his hand scrunching up the material of the shirt.</p><p>Air brushed the backs of her thighs, and she remembered she was standing in front of a mirror. But the thought was gone in the next instant as he tugged at her hair to angle her head for a deeper, hotly sexual kiss. Wet and open and demanding, it was the most intimate contact of her life. Her chest grew tight, so tight.</p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d A harsh order as Max broke the kiss.</p><p>Sucking in a gasping breath, she pressed her mouth back to his. Kissing was . . . wild and exhilarating and so shockingly intimate, she wasn\u2019t sure she could handle what came afterward. But she would. \u201cNo.\u201d The protest was rasped out as he broke the kiss a second time and gripped her arms, holding her hands from him.</p><p>A red flush rode his high cheekbones, and his voice, when he spoke, trembled with the force of emotion, \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be alone, Max.\u201d She tried to close the gap between them, but he was too strong. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had one hell of a psychic shock today,\u201d he said, refusing to budge. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let you cause further damage by overloading your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she snapped out in spite of the fact that her skin was all but crawling with need, and had the satisfaction of seeing his eyes narrow. \u201cI\u2019m not a child you have to protect. I know what I want.\u201d</p><p>Max hissed out a breath. \u201cYour shields\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with my shields,\u201d she said, blunt in her need, \u201cbut I know that right now, I\u2019m an enigma to those in the PsyNet. This is my chance. If that shield fails tomorrow, if my mind is torn open, so be it\u2014but don\u2019t you dare deny us this because you think you\u2019re protecting me. Don\u2019t you dare.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s fingers flexed on her wrists, but he didn\u2019t pull her forward. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d he asked, anger a vibrating thread in his voice.</p><p>She was taken aback by the question, by the glittering emotion in his eyes. \u201cMax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck do you think it\u2019ll do to me to love you, then watch as your mind breaks?\u201d Veins stood out along his arms, as if he was having to hold himself in vicious check to keep from shaking her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 32</p><p>Sophia\u2019s expression shifted from one emotion to the next with lightning speed, but Max had anticipated her, held her tight when she tried to tug herself out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t get to be a coward and back away now.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes blazed with fire. \u201cI\u2019m not being a coward. You\u2019re right\u2014it was selfish of me to ask this of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll walk away? Just put it to one corner of your Psy mind and forget we ever touched?\u201d</p><p>A tremble of her lower lip that she tried to hide from him. \u201cYes. I\u2019m Psy.\u201d Rote words, her face turned to the side. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to compartmentalize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d And then he kissed again, unable to stop, whatever remaining barriers he had shredded by her nearness, her scent, her presence, the fucking way she was trying so hard to fight the painful depth of her need because she didn\u2019t want to hurt him.</p><p>Her mouth opened under his even as she tried to pull away her wrists. He held her in place for a second before releasing her. Instead of pushing at him as he\u2019d half expected, she wrapped her arms around his neck and met him stroke for stroke, lick for lick. Groaning, he bunched up the shirt she was wearing with one hand, reaching down to cup her buttocks with the other.</p> <p>Sophia moaned into his mouth, and he somehow found the presence of mind to lift his head, to ask, \u201cIs this hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pulling him back down, she used the skills she\u2019d just learned to drive him insane.</p><p>He felt his fingers digging into her soft flesh, made himself soften his hold. Her response was to scrape her teeth over his jaw, along his neck. His hands clenched again, his eyes flicking to the mirror at her back. The raw eroticism of the image was beyond anything he\u2019d dared imagine. Her skin was delicately flushed, a creamy softness against his rougher, darker hands.</p><p>Realizing she\u2019d gone still, he looked down into her face. Her lips were parted, swollen from their kisses. \u201cIs the visual impact very intense?\u201d</p><p>It was such a Sophia way to put it that the almost violent edge of his hunger shifted into something different, exquisitely tender. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite ready for it yet,\u201d he murmured, indulging himself by stroking his hand across her lush flesh.</p><p>\u201cLater?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater.\u201d Sucking on her lower lip, he nudged her away from the mirror and toward the bed, not sure he could leash himself in the face of such delicious temptation. She didn\u2019t resist, letting him touch her as he would, lead her as he would.</p><p>It was a heady sensation, and one that paradoxically gave him more control. Nipping at her lower lip, he pulled back a little. She looked lost for an instant, until he raised his hands to the front of the shirt she wore to undo the top button. Her head dipped, watching him release button after button until the shirt hung completely undone. Lifting a hand, he touched a single finger on the dip of her breastbone, catching her attention.</p><p>Her chest rose up and down in a jagged rhythm as he ran that finger slowly down the valley of her breasts and over the softness of her abdomen to circle at her navel. Making an inarticulate sound, she gripped his biceps. \u201cThat is not an intimate region.\u201d</p><p>It took him a second. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d Spreading his fingers on her, he just barely brushed the curls at the apex of her thighs.</p><p>Her fingers tightened on him, her breaths turning shallow. Leaving his hand where it was, he tugged back her head and took another kiss, but this one was slow, lazy, as he attempted to seduce her into relaxing. She responded like wildfire, but her body remained on edge, almost quivering with tension. Kissing his way along her jaw, he said, \u201cTake off the shirt.\u201d</p><p>She went motionless, her breath hot against his neck. For a moment, he thought he\u2019d pushed her too far, and went to back off. But she lifted her hands to the lapels of the shirt at that moment, her fingers bloodless from the force of her grip.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked, nuzzling at her, taking the scent of her into his lungs. \u201cWant to stop?\u201d</p><p>The answer was soft but immediate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWant me to help you?\u201d</p><p>An almost imperceptible nod.</p><p>Forcing himself to keep a stranglehold on his own hunger, he lifted his hands to close over hers. Together, they peeled apart the edges of the shirt to her shoulders. \u201cLet go,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>It took several seconds, but her fingers opened. He held the shirt at her shoulders for a long moment before releasing the fabric. She could\u2019ve stopped its descent using her arms, but she relaxed them and the material slid off her with the hushed grace of a lover\u2019s caress. Instead of gorging himself on the lush beauty of her, he held her close, placing his hand very carefully on her lower back, his eyes locked with hers, his mouth a whisper\u2019s breath from her own.</p><p>There was, he was glad to see, no fear in her. A little trepidation, but that, he could understand. Smiling, he kissed her again, lazy, easy, undemanding. Her mouth opened under him, but her body continued to thrum with tension. \u201cWhat\u2019re you afraid of?\u201d he finally asked, cupping her cheek with his free hand. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say nothing.\u201d</p><p>A long, shuddering breath. \u201cI just want to get it over with once\u2014then I\u2019ll know what to expect.\u201d</p><p>Tenderness swept over him, along with a touch of chagrin. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly the kind of thing a man wants to hear when he\u2019s trying to seduce his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d A worried look. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019m stumbling in the dark. If I knew, then I could . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl it?\u201d A gentle tease.</p><p>Her hands fisted at his waist. \u201cYou think I should just let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, sipping at her mouth between words. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a little edgy their first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about instead of rushing it,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwe do what feels good? No expectations, no end goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to finish.\u201d A stubborn look.</p><p>Affectionate hunger rocked through him, at once savage and playful. \u201cYeah?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help his smile. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, as if she\u2019d read something on his face that worried her. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>But he was already swinging her up in his arms and placing her on the bed. Coming down over her, he settled himself in the vee of her thighs. \u201cWrap your legs around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat feels . . .\u201d Breathy, almost shocked. \u201cYour jeans . . .\u201d</p><p>He shifted against her delicate flesh, knowing the rough material would intensify the sensations. Giving an inarticulate cry, she arched her body. It was all the invitation he needed. Dipping his head, he took one dark little nipple into his mouth and sucked hard, even as he insinuated a hand between their bodies, reaching for the tiny bud in the liquid-soft center of her that could give so much pleasure.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his shoulders as she tried to pull him closer and push him away at the same time. Shifting his attention to her neglected breast, he began to play with her clitoris, hard then soft. There. He felt it the instant she reacted, modified his stroke to what brought her the most pleasure, lifting himself off her enough that he could stroke downward to rub at the sensitive entrance to her body as well.</p><p>She was wet, slick. He couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to dip his finger within. That was all it took.</p><p>A choked scream. Her body arching bowstring tight.</p><p>He could feel the edge of the pleasure that pulsed through her, wanted only to bury himself inside her, feel those muscles clench around his cock. Sweat beaded along his spine as he stroked her down from the orgasm instead.</p><p>The single thing that made it bearable was that he\u2019d done this to her, to his smart, sexy, stubborn . . . and vulnerable J.</p><p>Rising to brace his palms on either side of her when she slumped onto the bed, her chest heaving, he took a kiss. Another. She gave of herself without hesitation, her body limp beneath his, her skin sheened with perspiration. \u201cFeeling more relaxed?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Sophia lifted her lashes to see pure wickedness in the gorgeous bitter-chocolate eyes looking down at her. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Her own lips curved\u2014something that felt sparkling, new, and sublime in its perfection. \u201cDid I rush you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little, but I plan to get my revenge.\u201d Another Max kiss\u2014as if he had all the time in the world to taste her. \u201cNow, just lie back and enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Right at that moment, she couldn\u2019t have done anything else. Intellectually, she\u2019d known about orgasms, but it was quite a different matter to have one tear through her body. \u201cIs that what it\u2019ll be like when we have sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Exactly. So don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>She thought she caught a strangled edge in those words, but Max had dipped his head to kiss his way along her collarbone and it became difficult to think. Managing to raise her arms enough to touch his back, she pulled at his T-shirt. \u201cWill you take this off?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cYou okay with that much tactile contact after what we just did?\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to say yes at once, but she took a moment to think about it. \u201cYes.\u201d A strange feeling in her chest, a mix of pleasure, anticipation and . . . laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderfully blockheaded.\u201d</p><p>His laugh sounded startled out of him. Getting up to straddle her on his knees, he grinned. \u201cGuess being wooden\u2019s taken on a whole new meaning around you.\u201d He stripped off his T-shirt with an economy of motion that struck her as very male. It was as he twisted to throw the T-shirt off the side of the bed that she caught it.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Rising up on her elbows, she tried to see around to his back. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, color streaked across his cheekbones. \u201cA memento of my misspent youth.\u201d</p><p>She was even more curious now. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Muttering under his breath, he leaned down to kiss her instead. \u201cYou can look at it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth swept over hers, all demand and a tightly wound hunger. Oh, she thought, oh. And that was all her mind had the capacity to think because he was pressing her down onto the bed and the skin-to-skin contact was a shocking whip of fire through her body. But rather than drawing back as she would have once, she arched toward him. No more fear, she thought. This was life. This was Max. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSophie, my sweet, sexy, Sophie.\u201d His jaw brushed over her neck as he lowered his head to kiss her breasts, his mouth possessive in a way she\u2019d never known she craved until this moment, until this man. Twisting under the grip he had on her rib cage\u2014holding her in place for his maddening caresses, she felt the oh-so-intriguing outline of his erection pressing against her thigh.</p><p>\u201cMax, please.\u201d She pushed at the sleek heat of his shoulders.</p><p>He lifted his head, his hair hanging messy and touchable across his forehead. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to see.\u201d</p><p>Shuddering, he let her roll him onto his back. His jaw was a brutal line, the muscles in his arms rock hard as he gripped the bars in the headboard, but he said nothing as she rose beside him, as she ran her hand down the muscled plane of his chest in sensual exploration. \u201cYour chest is smooth.\u201d Dark gold and free of hair. \u201cExcept here.\u201d A thin line of black that began just below his belly button and arrowed inexorably downward.</p><p>Max hissed out a breath as she followed that path with her finger. Looking up at him through her lashes, she felt something a little bit sinful come to purring life deep within her soul. \u201cI\u2019m a very quick learner, you know.\u201d</p><p>He said a word that turned the air blue. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly in the mood to be teased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Feeling an odd exhilaration in her blood, she went to the button of his jeans and found it already undone. She could see why. He was straining against the zipper. Tugging at the metal tab, she went to pull it down when Max said, \u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d and reached for it.</p> <p>She caught his hand, lacing her fingers through his. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>A heated look. \u201cYou touch me and it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll start again.\u201d Pressing her lips to their clasped hands, she untangled their fingers. Though he gave her a scorching look, he didn\u2019t try to halt her again when she skimmed her hands over the lean-hipped beauty of him, began to tug at the zipper. She was careful, but not hesitant. And that was Max\u2019s gift to her. With no other man could she imagine being this open, this vulnerable.</p><p>Max\u2019s abdomen relaxed a fraction as she finished unzipping him. He was\u2014only just\u2014contained within his briefs. Curiosity swept over her in a wave of unashamed lust. She\u2019d seen medical images of men, been taught about sexual organs in her health lessons, but no one had ever told her that everything would change when it was her man. Her fingers itched to stroke him, her heart thundering in excitement, mouth dry with anticipation.</p><p>Looking up, she saw that he\u2019d closed his eyes, the cords of his neck strained white against the warm tone of his skin. And she knew he wouldn\u2019t stop her, no matter what she desired. Trembling with need that made her skin tight, her body slick, she gave in to the luscious molten heat uncurling in her stomach and began to kiss her way down that thin path of hair. The texture of it was surprisingly silky rough against his heated flesh, and it was instinct to stroke her hand over his skin as she tasted.</p><p>\u201cJesus baby.\u201d Strangled words as she lay her cheek on his abdomen and reached down to close her fingers over the stiff length of him through the black fabric of his briefs. Max\u2019s entire form went rigid . . . and it just felt exquisitely right to lick her tongue across the very edge of his briefs, to squeeze her hand firmly along the masculine heat in her hold.</p> <p>\u201cSophie!\u201d</p><p>Max walked out of the bathroom to find Sophia curled up under the sheets. There was a look of distinct guilt on her face. Joy warmed him up from the inside out, but he kept his expression stern. \u201cThat\u2019s twice you\u2019ve rushed me.\u201d He hadn\u2019t lost control like that . . . well, ever. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m not going to punish you for it.\u201d</p><p>Color tinged her cheeks as he slipped in under the sheets beside her. But no matter the temptation, he didn\u2019t pull her into his arms, having noticed that she was reacting much more quickly to even the slightest touch. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a while for you to recover.\u201d</p><p>A stubborn look that faded into a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I think I\u2019ve pushed it as far as my senses will take today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s like a person who\u2019s been starving,\u201d Max murmured. \u201cWhen you start to eat again, you have to do it in small bites at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I bite you?\u201d A teasing question that didn\u2019t surprise him now that he\u2019d met the wicked side of her.</p><p>\u201cIf you ask nice.\u201d</p><p>They lay together for a time, talking about nothing, and then later as they sat side by side in the living room, about the complex jigsaw that was the Nikita investigation. But eventually, she had to go to her own apartment. \u201cI wish I could spend all night with you,\u201d she said to him as he walked her over. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be too much today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he said, keeping his distance as she unlocked the door and entered. \u201cSophia?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back, so beautiful with those amazing eyes and that soft dark hair.</p><p>\u201cTell me if anything happens.\u201d His hand tightened on the doorjamb at the thought of losing her to the ferocity of her gift, of never again seeing her lying rumpled and smiling in his bed, never again hearing her talk in that prim tone that held an undertone of wild emotion.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d A steady answer, but when she looked up, her eyes were bruised. \u201cI\u2019m so angry, Max,\u201d she said in harsh whisper. \u201cHow am I supposed to fight my own mind?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 33</p><p>Sophia Russo may require further persuasion re the Valentine case.</p><p>\u2014Jay Khanna to unnamed contact via e-mail</p><p>Frustrated, choked up with a rage that had nowhere to go, Max made a cup of coffee and tried to lose himself in work. Sophia had updated him on everything she\u2019d discovered during the time he\u2019d been tied up in the wrenching aftermath of the discovery of Gwyn Hayley\u2019s body, but now he began to read her notes in depth. She had one hell of a brain, he thought. The information was not only neatly bullet-pointed and outlined, but cross-referenced in a way that told him she had an innate understanding of how his own mind worked.</p><p>Near the end of the file, he came across something that made him frown. Knowing he needed Sophia to explain the relevance of the information in a Psy context, he began to get up\u2014when he caught the blinking time code on the comm panel.</p><p>One a.m.</p><p>His gaze went to the wall that separated his apartment from Sophia\u2019s, and he couldn\u2019t help but remember the softness of her skin, the way her pulse had rocketed under his touch, the delicate, enticing scent of her. His body, having finally stopped riding the steel edge of need, grew hard, heavy once more. Sucking in a breath through clenched teeth, he threw down his pen and got up, intending to take a cold shower when something stopped him.</p><p>A noise.</p><p>Angling his head, he listened again. A soft thump. Once. Just once. But he\u2019d heard.</p><p>Sophie.</p><p>He grabbed his stunner and walked quietly to the door. Activating the outside cameras, he checked that the space immediately outside his door was clear before exiting\u2014with a vigilance all cops learned on their first day on the job. The corridor proved empty, the lighting muted to night levels. Stepping to Sophia\u2019s apartment, he scanned himself in using his palm print, his access courtesy of Sophia herself.</p><p>Worried that she\u2019d had a blackout as a result of the previous day\u2019s events, but forcing himself to move with caution in case of an intruder, he made his way through the unlighted living area and to her bedroom.</p><p>The bed held only rumpled sheets and an organizer with a bright, glowing screen. She\u2019d been awake, too, he thought. Whatever had happened, it hadn\u2019t taken her unawares.</p><p>Fur across his foot. Morpheus.</p><p>Following the cat\u2019s night-glow gaze, he felt his toes nudge something on the floor.</p><p>He froze, bent down. The feel of cotton covering warm skin. No. Continuing to hold his stunner at the ready, even as he checked Sophia\u2019s pulse, he said, \u201cLights, night mode.\u201d The lights came on, on a dim setting, making the transition from dark to light much easier. No one jumped out, the shadows hiding nothing malignant. He looked over the bathroom quickly just in case. Nothing. Whatever had happened, it had happened in Sophia\u2019s mind.</p><p>Returning, he bent down to check her for injuries, found no cuts, no abrasions. But when he lifted her eyelids, it was to see her eyes swallowed by black. \u201cSophie,\u201d he said again, his tone firm though an anguished rage tore through him\u2014driven by a part of him that didn\u2019t understand logic, only a powerful, visceral need for her voice.</p><p>No response.</p><p>Sliding his arms beneath her body, he lifted her up and took her to the bed, pulling a comforter over her before his hand went to the pocket of his jeans, where he\u2019d left his cell. Pressing in a familiar code, he said, \u201cI need Psy help.\u201d</p><p>But the Psy who turned up a bare ten minutes later with a tall amber blond male wasn\u2019t anyone he\u2019d expected. He recognized her of course\u2014that distinctive red hair, those cardinal eyes. Faith NightStar was said to be the strongest F-Psy in or out of the Net, her ability to see the future a gift and a curse both. But Max knew he\u2019d always see it as a gift after the way she\u2019d saved their lives. \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>As Faith hurried past and unerringly to the bedroom, Max paused long enough to say, \u201cYou got here quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d the changeling male said, \u201cwoke me up an hour ago and told me we\u2019d be needed in the city around now.\u201d</p><p>Max, walking back to the bedroom, stopped for an instant. \u201cI guess I never thought about the reality of being mated to an F-Psy.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn slapped him on the back. \u201cAsk me sometime about how fucking difficult it is to surprise her with a gift.\u201d It was said with affection, his tone that of a man who wasn\u2019t only delighted in his mate, but didn\u2019t care if the whole world knew about it.</p><p>They entered the bedroom at that moment, and everything else faded. Faith was sitting beside Sophia\u2019s stiff form, her hand on his J\u2019s forehead. \u201cHer telepathic shields are terrifyingly thin, but they are continuing to protect her,\u201d Faith said, before pausing for almost ten seconds. \u201cHer PsyNet shields appear fine. A little unusual according to my contact, but not damaged.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max didn\u2019t ask about Faith\u2019s contact, taking it as a given that that contact would soon be dead if it became known he or she was sharing information outside the Net. \u201cDo we need to get her to a hospital?\u201d</p><p>The foreseer\u2019s endless eyes met his. \u201cNo. She\u2019ll wake up soon.\u201d</p><p>A simple, absolute answer, and yet . . . \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be time after she wakes.\u201d Faith looked up at her mate as he came to stand beside her, his fingers playing through her hair. \u201cCoffee?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s smile was indulgent. \u201cAddict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fault.\u201d The foreseer\u2019s expression was somber, belying her light words. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to talk once she wakes.\u201d</p><p>Smile fading into an expression of intense tenderness, Vaughn untangled his fingers from his mate\u2019s hair and went to exit the room. \u201cCome on, Max. You can\u2019t do anything here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d No way in hell was he leaving his Sophie alone.</p> <p>Faith seemed to struggle with something as she rose to her feet. But in the end, she followed Vaughn out in silence.</p><p>Faith walked straight to where Vaughn was measuring out coffee grounds. \u201cHey.\u201d Putting an arm around her, he hugged her to the solid strength of his side. \u201cThe answer\u2019s no.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face against his chest as he turned to embrace her fully, loving the scent of him. \u201cHow did you know what I was going to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have been mated over a year. Give the cat a little credit.\u201d A teasing kiss from her jaguar, his hand curving around her throat in gentle possession.</p><p>\u201cYou said it yourself, Faith.\u201d A quiet reminder, the jaguar looking out of his eyes. \u201cThe future isn\u2019t fixed. It wasn\u2019t for Dorian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d seen the sentinel\u2019s future blacked out, had thought it meant death, but he\u2019d survived. \u201cIt\u2019s different this time, Vaughn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw bits and pieces of reality\u2014the fact that Sophia would need us for some reason tonight, other events that may or may not happen, but I felt this gathering wave. I can\u2019t describe it, but I know something huge is about to happen, and it\u2019s centered around Sophia Russo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about more than the life of one person . . . two people,\u201d he added, and she knew he\u2019d seen the way Max looked at Sophia. So had she.</p><p>Her foreseer\u2019s heart hurt for them, for the future they didn\u2019t have. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like this, but from the research I\u2019ve been doing\u201d\u2014using the records her father had managed to unearth then smuggle out to her\u2014\u201cF-Psy in the past noted the same kinds of sensations before major catastrophic events.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn cupped her face, an areola of pure gold around his irises, the jaguar rising to the surface. \u201cAre you talking earthquake, plague, political turmoil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny, all,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut whatever it is, Sophia Russo is the domino that will begin an unstoppable cascade.\u201d The J was the leading edge of a perfect storm, one that might annihilate them all.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if he simply doesn\u2019t exist in Sophia\u2019s future,\u201d Faith said, tugging at the tie that held back her mate\u2019s hair. It fell over her hands in a stroke of rough silk, a familiar anchor. \u201cBut I don\u2019t get that same sense of blankness as I did with Dorian. Instead, it\u2019s this feeling that he\u2019s never been a part of her life. Which is impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn stilled. \u201cNot if the Sophia you see is Sophia after rehabilitation.\u201d</p><p>Faith shook her head in stunned horror, but he was right. Full rehabilitation wiped out the psyche, creating a slate so blank that nothing of the mind, the soul, remained.</p><p>Max argued with himself about whether or not to touch Sophia, knowing it had to have been their sexual play that had caused this, but driven by gut instinct, he got on the bed and cradled her in his lap. And the instant he did, it felt right. She was a soft, warm weight on him, her breathing easy, her heartbeat steady. Something wild and panicked inside him settled.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t left him, this J who\u2019d become the fulcrum of his universe.</p><p>A quiet sound, so quiet he hardly heard it. Shifting his hold, he pushed midnight strands of hair off her face, keeping his hand on her cheek. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>A hitched breath, eyes fluttering open. They remained drowned in black, endless and mysterious. \u201cWh\u2014\u201d A gasp, her hand flying up to close over his.</p><p>His soul went cold. Driven by primal need, had he made a fatal error? If he had, the shock would plunge her back into unconsciousness . . . or worse. But before he could break contact, she gripped his hand, tight, so tight. And as he watched, the liquid black began to recede from her eyes, until finally, only the violet of her iris, the normal black of her pupil was visible. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>He tried to catch her gaze, but it kept shifting. \u201cFocus, Sophie. Focus.\u201d Her disorientation worried him, could well be a signal of some kind of brain damage.</p><p>All at once her eyes locked to his. \u201cName\u2019s not Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? What is it?\u201d</p><p>The most minute of pauses. \u201cSophia Russo.\u201d It almost sounded like relief. \u201cSophia Russo,\u201d she repeated, \u201cGradient 8.85 J-Psy, employed by the Justice Corps, temporarily attached to the office of Councilor Nikita Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Relief washed through him as well. \u201cAnd who am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax Shannon, Enforcement detective, highest clearance rate in New York, natural mental shield, and . . . and hands that touch me.\u201d Her own hand spasmed around his, as if she\u2019d only just become aware of how hard she\u2019d been holding on.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Taking that hand in his, he pressed a kiss to her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u201d His heart shuddered though he fought to keep his voice calm.</p><p>\u201cMax, you can call me Sophie,\u201d she said in a quickness of words, as if afraid he\u2019d take her earlier statement the wrong way.</p><p>\u201cI plan to do it for a long time.\u201d He\u2019d lost everything else and survived, but he couldn\u2019t lose her, not his J. It would break him.</p><p>Intertwining her fingers with his, she turned her head a little. \u201cSomeone else is here. I can hear sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith NightStar and her mate, Vaughn D\u2019Angelo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith, foreseer.\u201d She dropped her gaze to their hands. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Faith and Vaughn walked back in at that moment, with four mugs of coffee in hand. \u201cWe were hoping you could tell us,\u201d Faith said, placing two of the mugs on the bedside table.</p><p>Sophia looked up but didn\u2019t move off Max\u2019s lap, which told him more about her condition than anything else. Because his Sophie had a quiet reserve about her in public, or when they were around others, one that he\u2019d come to realize was part of her nature, not a product of Silence. She\u2019d never be comfortable with open displays of emotion\u2014but that was fine with Max, because with him, she lowered her guard, gave him her trust.</p><p>Breaking their handclasp, he picked up one of the mugs and urged it into her hands. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>She took an obedient sip, her eyes not on Faith, but on Vaughn. Max felt a sharp tug of irritation. He recalled hearing that Vaughn wasn\u2019t a leopard, but the male was a cat of some kind. He had the same feline grace that Max had seen in Lucas, in Dorian. And Max had been in the world long enough to know that women were drawn to the cat changelings.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t move off Vaughn even when the cat stretched out his arm on the sofa behind Faith\u2019s head, curving his hand around his mate\u2019s nape in a blatant display\u2014and statement\u2014of his loyalty. It was Faith who broke the odd silence. \u201cIf you don\u2019t stop looking at my mate that way, I might have to unsheathe my claws.\u201d Her smile took any sting out of what was clearly a tease.</p><p>But Sophia didn\u2019t laugh. Keeping her eyes on Vaughn, she spoke to Faith. \u201cHe\u2019s not safe, you know. He could snap your neck with a single move. You should shift away from him.\u201d</p><p>Delighted at the reason she\u2019d been staring, Max fought not to laugh. But the look of affront on Vaughn\u2019s face was priceless. Burying his own face in Sophia\u2019s hair to muffle his laugh, he tugged her a little closer, just in case the changeling was annoyed enough to snarl at her. But Faith put a hand on her mate\u2019s thigh, and cardinal eyes gleaming with laughter, nodded at Sophia. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw stones. Look where you\u2019re sitting.\u201d</p><p>Sophia belatedly seemed to realize her position. Color tinged her cheeks, but she didn\u2019t move. That\u2019s my girl. Running a hand over her hair, Max asked her if she knew the reason she\u2019d fallen unconscious.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She cuddled impossibly closer to him. \u201cAn attempted hack into my brain.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 34</p><p>Max sucked in a breath, but it was Faith who next spoke. \u201cThat should be impossible. I know some F-designation men and women who see only the past, and they work for Justice\u2014their shields are impenetrable. I assume Js are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are,\u201d Sophia said, giving him the coffee so he could place it on the nightstand. \u201cBut the attempt was intense enough to cause near-unbearable pressure on my brain.\u201d Her body trembled just a little, but Max felt it.</p><p>Placing her on the bed with all the tenderness he had in him, he swung his legs over the side and said, \u201cWe can discuss this more later. Right now, Sophia needs to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Faith stood up at once. Vaughn followed a little more slowly.</p><p>Walking them to the door, Max was ready for the DarkRiver sentinel\u2019s final words. \u201cShe\u2019s still hooked into the Net, Max. Means she can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>He felt his hand clench on the door. \u201cSo was Faith when you met her if I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same situation, and you know it.\u201d The changeling didn\u2019t sound angry\u2014if anything, there was a gut-deep understanding in his tone. \u201cFaith was watched, but in an isolated setting. Sophia is in the middle of the Justice Corps. There are all kinds of eyes on her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And though the sentinel didn\u2019t say it, Max knew the implications\u2014Sophia might already have something in her head, something that had penetrated her shields without her knowledge.</p><p>Having changed into a loose T-shirt to sleep in, Sophia returned from the bathroom to find Max waiting by the bed. He looked strong and beautiful . . . and remote, the stunner he held loosely by his side a stark reminder of who he was, what he did.</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d It came out without thought, the heat of his body still imprinted on her skin. \u201cI think I can handle the sensations now.\u201d The invitation took all the courage she had. She bit her lip to quiet the plea that wanted to escape. She didn\u2019t want him to pity her\u2014but oh, how she needed him.</p> <p>No words but he placed the stunner on the bedside table and ripped off his T-shirt. She clenched her hands on the bottom of her own. Angling his head, he tugged down the comforter and waited for her to get in. As he went to follow, his jeans still on, she had a thought. \u201cMax, what if I\u2019m compromised in some way? You shouldn\u2019t leave a weapon that accessible to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafety\u2019s on, release programmed to my active thumbprint,\u201d he said, pulling the comforter over them. \u201cAnd no offense, Sophie, sweetheart, but you\u2019d make a very bad assassin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could blow out your mind,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNot easily,\u201d he answered. \u201cAccording to what I\u2019ve picked up over the years, a natural shield means I\u2019d have enough of a warning to go for my weapon, or considering the fact that you\u2019re a little bit of nothing\u2014knock you out cold.\u201d The words made him scowl.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Relieved\u2014in spite of the fact that she could see he hated the idea of hurting her\u2014she let him slide an arm under her head, the other going around her waist. That much sensation, that much contact, still burned a hot, wild flame across her skin, but she was, she thought, becoming used to it. With Max it wasn\u2019t an intrusion but a choice on her part. Turning, she placed her hands flat on his chest.</p> <p>Heat. A sudden fever. Almost pain.</p><p>\u201cBut no voices in my head,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo memories, no thoughts, no yesterdays but my own.\u201d</p><p>Max squeezed her gently, and she knew he understood. \u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall bites, remember?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t listen, lost in the storm of sensation, the world a kaleidoscope around her. \u201cWe never finished.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s hand stopped its soothing strokes over her back. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly in any shape\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head, she kissed the line of his neck, taking the taste of him into her lungs. \u201cSophie.\u201d Then his hand was on her cheek and she was being turned onto her back and he was kissing the breath out of her. The kaleidoscope spun and spun until it exploded.</p> <p>As the pieces rained around her, she found herself gripping Max\u2019s shoulders in an attempt to hold on. His muscles shifted beneath her palms, liquid and powerful. Instead of trying to control the amount of sensory input, she gave in, drowning in the wild heat of him, the delicious pressure of his lips, the way his thumb pressed down on her jaw to open her mouth to him.</p><p>Max felt the instant Sophia let go. Her entire body melted for him, every inch of her open in invitation.</p><p>It was the most luscious of temptations.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t about to take advantage of her when she\u2019d been disoriented and lost only minutes ago. Breaking the kiss, he looked into eyes that had gone pure black again\u2014but he could distinguish a difference, though he\u2019d have been hard-pressed to describe it. He just knew this time, it wasn\u2019t a marker of danger. \u201cDo all Psy eyes do that?\u201d An intimate murmur against her lips, his legs tangled with hers, his hand in her hair.</p><p>Her fingers stroked over his shoulders with quick, hungry movements, and he was male enough to adore her for being so very delighted with him. \u201cIt\u2019s more apparent at the higher end of the spectrum . . . but I think I may be even more susceptible to it, given the nature of my mind.\u201d Calm words, but her eyes, her body, told a different story.</p><p>He could almost feel the vibrating tension in her, every tendon held taut. \u201cI know who you are,\u201d he said, holding her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be scared away because of your \u2018imperfections.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A sheen of wet in her eyes, turning the midnight iridescent.</p><p>\u201cWe fit, you and I,\u201d he whispered looking into that haunting gaze. \u201cTwo broken pieces making a whole.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the most romantic of statements, but it was torn from his soul. \u201cI am not losing you.\u201d</p> <p>She tugged him down, kissing him until his body hummed for her, until her breath came in choppy gasps. He broke the kiss. \u201cIs this much contact causing you pain?\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Swearing, he rolled off to sit on the edge of the bed, looking back at her over his shoulder. \u201cWhy the hell did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying, Max.\u201d Curling onto her side, she watched him with an intense interest that told him he was the absolute and utter focus of her world. Some men would\u2019ve been scared away. Max knew he watched her the same way.</p><p>Her chest rose as she took a long, shuddering breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe these sensations. The closest word is pain, but I know that\u2019s not right. I don\u2019t crave pain. And yet I crave what happens when you touch me.\u201d</p><p>Max twisted so he could face her, one hand braced palm down beside her leg. \u201cIt sounds like your nerves are raw\u2014overloaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Clear words, a steel will. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to slow down.\u201d</p><p>He had a will as strong. \u201cNo more touching. I will not hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders slumped.</p><p>Sensing his advantage, he pushed. \u201cWhy did someone try to hack your mind tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because they wanted to contaminate the evidence I\u2019m due to give in a high-profile murder case,\u201d she said, her eyes not meeting his.</p><p>Shame, he thought, that\u2019s what he read in her expression. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you . . . just give me a little more time?\u201d So vulnerable, her emotions stripped bare. \u201cPlease, Max?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re using the world \u2018please\u2019 to get around me.\u201d</p><p>A startled flicker of light in her eyes. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not . . . but could I?\u201d</p><p>He felt his chest shake with unbidden, unexpected laughter. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to answer that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means I can.\u201d She sounded astonished and delighted in equal measures. \u201cI promise to use my powers for good.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over he slapped her lightly on the bottom through the comforter. \u201cYou have the makings of a brat in you.\u201d</p><p>A slow, so-slow smile, his Sophie beginning to wake from a decades-long sleep. \u201cI need to tell you something about the Nikita investigation that I forgot to mention earlier.\u201d</p><p>He kept his hand on her hip, enjoying the warm curves of her even if he couldn\u2019t touch skin. \u201cI meant to ask you something, too. About Ryan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who I wanted to discuss,\u201d she interrupted, \u201cspecifically, the reason for his reconditioning six months ago.\u201d</p><p>Max frowned. \u201cThe file\u2019s sealed.\u201d He\u2019d already tried to access it tonight.</p><p>\u201cI called in a favor from another J.\u201d Pushing up into a sitting position, she shivered when he slid his hand over to her thigh. \u201cRyan killed someone, but it was an accident. His telekinetic powers went out of control.\u201d</p><p>Stroking her through the comforter once more, Max got up to walk to the window and back. \u201cHow much would the reconditioning have messed with his head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way to know\u2014the process is intense, but it leaves the mind intact. That\u2019s the whole purpose\u2014to eliminate fractures so the individual can function.\u201d Her words held the knowledge of experience. \u201cIt would make sense that he\u2019d be sympathetic to Pure Psy if his own abilities are spiraling out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014Max folded his arms, leaning back on the wall beside the window\u2014\u201cwe come back to the fact that he wasn\u2019t working for Nikita at the time of the elevator sabotage. One mole I can accept. Two? No. Not in Nikita\u2019s organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still the best lead we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Max straightened. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t be going anywhere tonight. I\u2019ll call, make sure security has him in their sights. We can talk to him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was going to leave. Sliding down under the comforter, she turned her back to him. She\u2019d accepted his will, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to like it.</p><p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p><p>She thumped her pillow into shape.</p><p>A low blue word, then the bed dipped. \u201cI can\u2019t stay tonight, baby.\u201d His hand on her hip, a blaze of heat even through the comforter.</p><p>He\u2019d promised to fight for her. Well, she was going to fight for him, too. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be skin to skin.\u201d She turned to face him, keeping her hands to herself. \u201cYou can sleep on top of the comforter.\u201d Then she gave a small smile. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got the makings of a brat.\u201d But Max stayed, sleeping beside his J for the hours till dawn. The dream came just before he woke, a dream in which River ran laughing behind him as they chased a stray dog they\u2019d made into a pet.</p><p>He opened his eyes to find his throat thick with tears, his heart a swelling ache in his chest. And he knew he\u2019d dreamed the joy because of the woman who woke a moment later. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Sleepy eyes, dark curls falling across one cheek. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor making me remember.\u201d He\u2019d buried his past because it hurt too fucking much. But in doing so, he\u2019d buried River. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, \u201cyou would\u2019ve adored River. He could\u2019ve taught you every trick in the book on how to be a true brat.\u201d Then, as they rose, dressed, and ate, he told her about the brother who\u2019d left a mile-wide scar on his heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia halted Max when he would\u2019ve gotten out of the car at the Duncan building. \u201cI want to tell you about the reason for the hack.\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide anymore, not after the raw honesty of the memories he\u2019d shared, of the family he\u2019d shared. Her heart was so full it was hard to breathe, hard to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d Max said, his hand along the back of her seat, \u201cyou know it doesn\u2019t matter. Not between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can alter memories.\u201d She made no effort to dress it up.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She jerked up her head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cop, Sophie.\u201d A wry reminder. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been in the job two years before I realized what Js could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you hate us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always figured you had no choice in the matter. And, I did my job. I got the evidence. Not every major case is won or lost on the evidence of a J.\u201d</p> <p>She should\u2019ve ended it then, but now that she\u2019d begun, she couldn\u2019t stop. She would not steal his affection, his loyalty, through fraud. It would violate the trust between them, taint everything they had. So though the terror of rejection was a chill hand around her throat, she smoothed her flawlessly straight skirt down her legs and said, \u201cDo you remember Dr. Henley?\u201d The famous geneticist had killed his pregnant wife in cold blood, then sliced her up into neat little pieces and dumped those pieces in the sea when he\u2019d gone out for a Sunday fishing trip. There was even speculation that he\u2019d used some pieces as bait.</p><p>\u201cNot a case I could ever forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council planned to transfer him to a Psy facility where he could continue his groundbreaking work.\u201d The callous murder of an innocent woman and her unborn child had been considered a mere inconvenience. \u201cAll the Js knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity then,\u201d Max said in a hard voice, \u201cthat he had a sudden, violent embolism that stopped his heart on his first day in prison, died before the medics could get to him.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sucked in a breath. She\u2019d guessed he understood what Js were capable of, had wanted to drive home the point so that there would be absolute honesty between them, but from the way he spoke . . . \u201cHave you always known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCops call it the J-penalty.\u201d A grim look. \u201cYou weren\u2019t in the vicinity. I\u2019ve seen your record. You weren\u2019t anywhere near Henley\u2019s prison when he died.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then, \u201cNot me. Not that time.\u201d</p><p>He slid back his door. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>She got out to walk beside him, her heart a tight, hopeful knot. \u201cI know you\u2019ve accepted me\u201d\u2014and that remained a deep source of wonder\u2014\u201cbut I still thought you\u2019d be more . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard-assed?\u201d A snort. \u201cI\u2019ve seen rich men skate off rape charges, politicians bury abuse claims, young girls commit suicide after being hurt. I don\u2019t agree with vigilante justice, but Js aren\u2019t exactly vigilantes are they? They know the exact nature of a particular crime, and they tend to give out punishments perfectly calibrated to that crime\u2014and only in cases where justice would otherwise be defiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t judge and jury.\u201d She\u2019d never talked openly about this. Even among Js, it wasn\u2019t ever actually discussed. But they all knew the parameters, understood what the Corps would overlook as the cost of having Js in the system. \u201cWe\u2019re the last resort when the tools of justice fail the victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d Max said, coming to a stop in front of the elevators, his body angled to hide her from the surveillance cameras, \u201cis the impact on a J who acts as that last resort . . . as an executioner if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Every action has an opposite and equal reaction,\u2019 \u201d she said, quoting the well-known law of physics. \u201cThat maxim holds true on the psychic plane.\u201d</p><p>White lines bracketed Max\u2019s mouth. \u201cSo a J would be damaged by the event?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly damaged. I would say . . . changed.\u201d</p><p>A long, still pause. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d he finally said very, very quietly. \u201cDo you understand me, Sophia?\u201d</p><p>Her lips quivered for the barest fraction of a moment. \u201cMax, are you trying to fix me?\u201d It was impossible, and she couldn\u2019t bear for him to realize that too late, walk away.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m trying to save you.\u201d An implacable, absolute answer. \u201cIt\u2019s about choices. I need you to make one to fight those instincts\u2014every time you give in, it eats away a little bit of your psyche.\u201d</p><p>The otherness in her\u2014twined with those dark threads that tasted of the Net\u2014stirred, considered, bowed its head. \u201cI can do that.\u201d For Max, only for Max. He was a cop. He\u2019d accepted her past with open eyes and an open heart, but what she did from now on, even if only a few individuals realized the depth of the connection between them, would reflect on him, stain his career\u2014and she was too proud of him to chance that. \u201cIt\u2019s a small price to pay to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo price, Sophie, no ultimatums.\u201d An unqualified reassurance that made her want to pull him forward by the lapels of his suit jacket and kiss him again and again. \u201cYou belong to me\u2014and I\u2019m keeping you no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you belong to me, too.\u201d It came from the dark heart of her, the place where no light had ever shone . . . until this man looked at her with eyes that said she wasn\u2019t a piece of trash to be discarded because she\u2019d proved imperfect. For the first time in her life, she had started to feel whole, the scars, the fractures, simply a part of her.</p><p>Max shrugged, that lean dimple flashing in his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, everything in her\u2014even the once scared, lonely girl who\u2019d only ever spoken through the hand of cold justice before\u2014determined to stake its claim loud and clear, \u201cif I find a business card from a female in your jacket, she had better be a colleague.\u201d</p><p>Max felt a laugh build in his chest, had to fight the urge to tug Sophia into his arms and bite down on that full lower lip in a gesture of open possession. \u201cNo one will dare hit on me after I mention my wife is a J with a jealous streak.\u201d</p><p>Wife. Her composure splintered. \u201cMax, no matter what, we could never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Sophie. You\u2019re mine. End of story.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 35</p><p>In certain types of cases, most cops immediately suspect the father. Nobody thinks of the mother, not at first. Except me. And I wish I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p><p>Ryan Asquith entered the conference room looking as unruffled as ever, but that, of course, was de rigueur for the Psy. Max didn\u2019t say anything for several long seconds after the intern arrived. Taking her cue from him, neither did Sophia. Finally, Ryan glanced at his watch. \u201cAm I early, Detective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us you\u2019d undergone reconditioning,\u201d Max said, instead of answering his question.</p><p>The young male didn\u2019t so much as blink. \u201cEverything is in my file.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to mention the fact that you\u2019d killed using Tk when we\u2019re investigating a murder that may have had a Tk component?\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes skated away from Max\u2019s. \u201cI assumed you already knew. The personnel department did a full screen on me when I applied for this position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting thing is,\u201d Max murmured, \u201cseems the department just does a basic screen for short-term interns.\u201d</p><p>Sophia put her organizer on the table. \u201cThe detective doesn\u2019t understand, Ryan,\u201d she said in a quiet, calm tone.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Max raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThose of us who go through a reconditioning,\u201d Sophia answered, \u201caren\u2019t considered criminals for any acts committed during the period of fracture, because there is no intent.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded, holding Sophia\u2019s gaze. \u201cExactly. I knew if I told you of the incident, you would focus on me, leaving the true murderer to go free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can see,\u201d Sophia said, \u201chow this places you in the center of the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Ryan glanced down, then up, saying nothing.</p><p>Sophia tapped Max\u2019s foot at almost the same instant. Getting the hint, he rose to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab a bottle of water from outside while Ryan gets his thoughts in order. Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, some water would be great.\u201d</p><p>Watching the door close behind her cop, Sophia turned her attention to the boy in front of her. And he was just that, only a boy. A boy, who, somewhere deep inside, was terrified of his own abilities. \u201cTell me what you were hesitating to say in front of Detective Shannon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you keep it confidential?\u201d</p><p>Right then, Sophia saw something in Ryan\u2019s eyes that she\u2019d never expected. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t affect Councilor Duncan\u2019s safety, it won\u2019t go beyond these walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time of Edward Chan\u2019s murder, I\u2019d locked myself in one of the meeting rooms that almost no one uses because I needed to meditate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you continue to have trouble with your Silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It was a confession that could have this boy sent back to the Center, which made Sophia more inclined to believe him. \u201cWhy did you tell me?\u201d</p><p>Dark gray eyes locked with her own. \u201cYou\u2019re a J. I thought if anyone would understand the pressure, you would.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wondered if she was being played very skillfully. \u201cWhich meeting room?\u201d</p><p>Ryan gave her the details without hesitation. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not strong enough to teleport,\u201d he said, confirming what they\u2019d already determined. \u201cThat\u2019s never been in my skill set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan opened his mouth, paused, then said, \u201cNobody really pays attention to an intern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rumors in the city that Nikita is as flawed as her daughter.\u201d Ryan\u2019s tone dropped. \u201cI thought, at first, that it was just uninformed talk, but the whispers are gathering in momentum\u2014and that kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen without something, someone, feeding the fire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you have any idea of who it could be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Marsha,\u201d Ryan responded. \u201cShe has no genetic offspring. I believe she has given all her loyalty to the Councilor. I can\u2019t narrow it any further.\u201d</p><p>The door opened then and Max walked in. Sophia said, \u201cKeep your ears and eyes open, Ryan. Let me know if you hear anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d Rising, he glanced at Max, his expression opaque, his dress faultless\u2014the perfect Psy . . . on the surface. \u201cDo you have any further questions for me, Detective?\u201d</p><p>He left as soon as Max shook his head. \u201cI believe him,\u201d Sophia said after filling Max in. \u201cI think he applied to work for Nikita because of Sascha.\u201d</p><p>Max tipped back his chair. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious his reconditioning didn\u2019t work as well as everyone believes.\u201d Reaching out almost automatically, she pushed his chair back on all four feet. \u201cI think he\u2019s hoping that since Nikita has a daughter who feels emotion, she\u2019ll go easier on him if the truth comes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNikita\u2019s got a heart of fucking stone and I\u2019m being cruel to the stone there.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia had heard whispers of how Nikita had ascended to the Council\u2014her sheer cold-blooded nature couldn\u2019t be doubted. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear a \u2018but.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cShe allowed her daughter to grow to adulthood, when it would\u2019ve been far easier for Sascha to have had a fatal \u2018accident\u2019 in childhood,\u201d Sophia said, knowing he understood what she didn\u2019t say, the parallels she\u2019d drawn. \u201cAnd in the end, the reality matters less than the perception. Ryan wants to find something, someone who\u2019ll be on his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get why he\u2019d latch on to her,\u201d Max said, \u201cbut if Nikita\u2019s the best he can do, the kid\u2019s in serious trouble.\u201d He tapped the two printouts he\u2019d just put on the table. \u201cWe take Ryan and Marsha out\u2014I\u2019m with the kid on her loyalty, plus Sascha confirmed they were together when Chan died\u2014and we\u2019re left with Andre Tulane and Quentin Gareth.\u201d Tiny lines fanned out from the corners of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of things I want to check where those two are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding Tulane\u2019s mysterious weekly appointments?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s been very careful not to raise any red flags. Could be a case of hiding in plain sight.\u201d It would, Max thought, require balls of steel to pull that off in Nikita\u2019s territory.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t need me,\u201d Sophia said, her lips lush and distracting, \u201cI want to go back to the apartment and look through the PsyNet. I have a few ideas.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about the PsyNet, but what I do know tells me it\u2019ll put a huge amount of pressure on you to be surrounded by so much data, so many minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy PsyNet shields appear to be adapting to my increasing . . . need,\u201d she said, and he heard the thread of confusion in her tone, \u201cso that shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d His protective instincts burned a hot white flame. \u201cYou\u2019ll be alone if something happens.\u201d</p><p>That gave her pause. \u201cThere is a risk, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaith,\u201d Max interrupted, recalling the almost protective way the F-Psy had looked at Sophia. \u201cCall her. Ask if she\u2019ll spot you while you go diving through the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cardinal F-Psy,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cHer time is worth hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars. Why should she agree to waste it on me?\u201d</p><p>Max saw that she truly didn\u2019t understand. \u201cBecause DarkRiver\u2019s come to consider me a friend.\u201d And the cats understood\u2014even if they didn\u2019t exactly approve\u2014that Sophia was his. Plus\u2014\u201cYou got the message to Nikita when Sascha was threatened. Changelings don\u2019t forget things like that.\u201d He saw her absorb that, give a small nod.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her\u2014but doesn\u2019t the fact that Faith saved our lives cancel out any obligation on their part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not obligation. It\u2019s about building bonds.\u201d Placing his hand on the back of her chair, he met her gaze, the luxuriant softness of her hair brushing his skin. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be careful. I don\u2019t want you bleeding out because you\u2019ve been taking risks.\u201d</p><p>Her expression never changed, but he could see steam coming out her ears. \u201cI am not stupid, Detective Shannon. Kindly get that thought into your head.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to kiss her.</p><p>Kaleb walked into Nikita\u2019s office to find her just ending a conversation with a tall male of mixed ethnicity who didn\u2019t move like a changeling but a human. Kaleb knew who the male was, of course. He\u2019d known all about Max Shannon almost the instant after Nikita requested him. The Enforcement detective wasn\u2019t only good at his job, he was as tenacious and stubborn as a bloodhound.</p><p>\u201cCouncilor Krychek,\u201d the detective said with a small nod as he walked out of the room, closing the door behind himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need with an Enforcement agent?\u201d he asked Nikita as he took a seat in the chair across from her. \u201cWe have Arrows for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Arrows are Ming\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed an impartial party.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb thought of the continued attempts to hack his shields, the sense of being very closely observed\u2014and the failed tries to track him through the PsyNet when he didn\u2019t want to be tracked. He could have ended the game days ago, turning the tables on his trackers\u2014though, given their skill, it would\u2019ve taken a concentrated amount of time and effort\u2014but he was intrigued enough to let it continue. Because there was one group and one group alone in the Net with the covert skills to evade the traps he\u2019d laid to date\u2014and if that group had decided to shift its allegiance . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hemorrhaging people,\u201d he said to Nikita, keeping his other thoughts to himself.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019ve noticed puts you at the top of the suspect list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary. We both know that I do what needs to be done myself. I don\u2019t need to rely on others who might make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Nikita settled back in her chair at his plain speaking. \u201cHave you noticed something in Henry\u2019s pattern of behavior?\u201d</p><p>Kaleb hadn\u2019t, and being out of the loop was not something he appreciated. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather show you.\u201d Turning her chair toward the thin comm screen mounted on one wall, she darkened her windows and brought up a map of the world. \u201cThe red dots indicate the places where Henry has been in the past six months. The blue dots indicate incidents that took place at the same time.\u201d</p><p>There were clusters of blue around every single red dot.</p><p>\u201cIncidents have been increasing,\u201d Kaleb said. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible that he could have coincidentally been at the same locations\u2014but I\u2019m assuming the incidents were major enough to have caught your notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the first five or so, no,\u201d Nikita said. \u201cAs you say, there have been little outbursts of violence here and there, so I paid them no notice. But these incidents don\u2019t involve violence\u2014except of the self-inflicted kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuicides?\u201d That pricked his interest. Suicide wasn\u2019t considered taboo in Psy culture. The majority of those who recognized their mental patterns as aberrant chose to end their existence rather than face rehabilitation. But the chances of the suicides\u2014ten or more in each location\u2014lining up so neatly with Henry\u2019s travels was exceptionally low.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain he\u2019s used the tactic before,\u201d Nikita said.</p><p>Kaleb agreed. There\u2019d been a string of violent incidents several months ago, with Psy breaking conditioning in public. All of those Psy appeared to have been programmed to suicide after completing their task, or if caught. \u201cHis recent behavior does, however, suggest that he\u2019s seen the error of that line of thinking.\u201d Given the way the PsyNet functioned, violence only spawned more violence. A constant feedback loop.</p><p>Nikita put down the remote but didn\u2019t erase the image. \u201cSeveral of the individuals who suicided were on the rehabilitation watchlist. The others could\u2019ve been fragmenting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Henry could see it as removing violence from the Net.\u201d Kaleb considered the idea. \u201cCan you send me the full data on the suicides?\u201d The file was telepathed into his mind an instant later.</p><p>Nikita checked messages on her organizer as he went through the list.</p><p>\u201cHe eliminated an erratic but highly intelligent chemist,\u201d Kaleb said, \u201ctwo medical specialists, and at least one trained sharpshooter. And that\u2019s at first glance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt continues like that,\u201d Nikita told him. \u201cHe might see it as erasing the weak from the Net, but he\u2019s also shoving the balance toward mediocrity.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb looked at her. \u201cOr perhaps Henry hasn\u2019t yet given up on the idea of a fully coherent Net.\u201d Before her defection, Council scientist Ashaya Aleine had been close to developing a neural implant that would\u2019ve instituted Silence at the biological level, creating a true hive mind. She\u2019d destroyed all the pertinent data when she\u2019d defected, but that knowledge could\u2019ve been recreated. \u201cHe may be pruning those he thinks will prove a challenge to that goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I suggest you be careful.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb turned away from the screen as she flicked it off. Her windows cleared a moment later. \u201cI appreciate the information\u2014we\u2019ll have to consider how to proceed with this. But I wanted to speak to you about another matter.\u201d</p><p>Nikita waited in pristine silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve discovered some rather interesting facts about E-Psy.\u201d Facts that could turn Nikita\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d into an asset.</p><p>Nikita put aside her organizer. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 36</p><p>You make me feel strong, make me feel as if I can fight fate itself.

Faith NightStar wasn\u2019t anywhere near as physically imposing as Max, but she had a presence. Then there was the long-limbed female who\u2019d accompanied her. \u201cSophia,\u201d Faith said. \u201cThis is Desiree.\u201d</p> <p>Recognizing Desiree for what she was\u2014a bodyguard\u2014Sophia told her guests to make themselves comfortable in the living area before she walked into the bedroom and took a cross-legged position in the middle of the bed. Surfing the Net didn\u2019t require much preparation for most people, but the more centered she was, the less chance of an accidental breach. Because even in the Net, there were individuals with weak or useless shields. Their thoughts leaked out in a constant barrage.</p><p>A Sensitive could easily get caught in the psychic storm.</p><p>But Sophia had no intention of being thrown up against the rocks.</p><p>Narrowing her thoughts to a fine, fine point, she took a careful step into the dark skies of the PsyNet and dropped her highly effective automatic firewalls, wrapping herself in much more mundane ones instead\u2014so she could go where she needed to go without being noticed. There was an element of risk to her choice. If any of her fragmentation . . . her feelings, leaked out, she\u2019d be hunted down in minutes. And once they found her, rehabilitation would follow so fast, she\u2019d have no chance of escape. \u201cSo I\u2019ll be very careful,\u201d she muttered, and went to merge into the slipstream of the Net.</p><p>Except her shields reset to the distinctive new formation without warning. And no matter how many times she tried, they wouldn\u2019t remain ordinary, unremarkable. \u201cI need you to behave,\u201d she finally muttered aloud in frustration. \u201cI might as well be wearing a target on my back if I go out like this.\u201d</p> <p>Her shields turned the exact velvet black of the Net, making her effectively invisible.</p><p>Sophia swallowed on the physical plane. \u201cOh . . . that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>No response, but she had the impression that something was watching, listening. It should\u2019ve disconcerted her, and it did to an extent. But whatever that something was, it was also protecting her. And she wasn\u2019t about to reject it . . . not when the otherness in her, the broken girl who\u2019d finally become an integrated part of her after two long decades, recognized the pain in that entity, as if it expected to be kicked aside, to be shoved into a corner, to be forgotten. I accept, Sophia thought deep in her mind. Thank you.</p><p>No response, but her shields seem to strengthen even further as she slipped into the Net\u2014sleek, dark, impenetrable. The psychic network around her was the biggest data archive in the world, its information highways updated every second of every day by uploads from the millions of minds jacked into its psychic fabric, but as a J in possession of often confidential information, Sophia was trained to be far more careful about what she shared. The majority of the time, the only things she uploaded were the official, court-approved results of her cases.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just purposefully uploaded data that filled the Net. There were fragments of thought, images, things that had escaped as a result of inadequate or fragmented shielding, conversations that had taken place in the Net outside of a mental vault. Things did decay after a period of time\u2014but that period could never be predicted. She\u2019d once caught whispers that had mentioned events of a hundred-years past. Other comments decayed almost as soon as they were spoken.</p><p>You could spend an eternity surfing the slipstream. However, as a young intern, Sophia had been taught to search using highly refined filters\u2014she\u2019d worked for a prosecutor one summer, a judge another, tracking down specific pieces of data. Now, she used those same skills to search for any mention of Pure Psy.</p> <p>A significant number of hits.</p><p>Rumors mostly, as Pure Psy didn\u2019t officially exist. And yet almost everyone in the Net knew about them. It was a very effective technique, Sophia was forced to admit. Those in agreement with Pure Psy\u2019s worldview made the effort to find them. On the flip side, those who didn\u2019t share that view tended to dismiss the group as nothing but a small fringe element.</p><p>As she drilled down layer by layer, sorting through massive amounts of data, she began to glimpse the full extent of the group\u2019s insidious growth. Pure Psy was whispered of in French, Malayalam, Russian, Maori, Tongan, Greek, Swahili, Urdu, and a number of other languages she couldn\u2019t immediately identify. Saving as much of the data as she could for future translation, she focused on the pieces she could understand.</p><p>. . . good of the race.</p><p>Pure Psy have the right . . .</p><p>Outside Council control . . .</p><p>. . . backing. Definitely Council backed.</p><p>I don\u2019t see the validity in closing the Net.</p> <p>They\u2019ve been behind the Jax cleanups . . .</p><p>That last whisper caught Sophia\u2019s interest. Jax was the scourge of the Psy, a drug that many said broke conditioning on the most basic level, allowing the user to feel emotion. True or not, it was a cancer no one had been able to excise from the population. But, Sophia thought, she had noticed a decrease in the number of addicts on the streets of late\u2014and she hadn\u2019t seen any at all since coming to San Francisco.</p><p>Of course, that could be as a result of the heavy changeling presence in the city. Jax users tended to stick to more Psy-friendly locations.</p><p>My family is still discussing the matter.</p><p>. . . good of the Psy. It\u2019ll bring us back into . . .</p><p>The changelings and humans are irrelevant. It\u2019s only the</p><p>PsyNet that matters.</p><p>That last summed up the tenor of the more clandestine discussions, and of Pure Psy. The group was intent on an isolationist policy. It believed the PsyNet had been corrupted by outside influences and was bent on bringing all Psy back into the fold.</p><p>Whether they wanted to come or not.</p><p>Having managed to get his hands on the nav file from Andre Tulane\u2019s personal vehicle\u2014thanks to some discreet help from the Duncan Corporation\u2019s head mechanic\u2014Max was on his way to where the slender black male disappeared every second Tuesday, when his stomach growled. Dropping into a nearby deli, he placed his order then made a call to Sophia\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d Faith answered, her voice consciously quiet. \u201cCatching a nap after the exertion, but otherwise okay.\u201d</p><p>The image of Sophie cradled up in bed made his body fill with a warmth that had nothing to with sex and everything to do with a harsh, protective tenderness. \u201cCall me if that changes.\u201d</p><p>A slight pause. \u201cMax, she\u2019s a J. You understand what that means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>It was the care in her tone that stopped him from snapping at her. Faith, he thought, probably comprehended more about the pressures that faced a J than almost anyone else outside the Corps. \u201cI know. Doesn\u2019t mean I have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like Vaughn.\u201d</p><p>Since the changeling had managed to save his mate, Max figured that was a good thing.</p><p>Hanging up after a quick good-bye, he grabbed his chicken and avocado sub and took a seat at one of the tables. He was in the process of demolishing it when Clay slid into the seat on the other side, his own sub in hand. \u201cI got something for you,\u201d the sentinel said, taking a long draw of the energy drink he\u2019d ordered along with the sub.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor on the street is that Psy are meeting in little groups all over the place,\u201d the sentinel said. \u201cBut they\u2019re being covert about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAvoiding Nikita\u2019s eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossible. Don\u2019t forget, Anthony Kyriakus is also in the general area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2014he\u2019s out by Tahoe.\u201d And though Faith\u2019s father kept a lower profile than Nikita, he controlled a vast network of foreseers\u2014an immeasurable advantage over his enemies. \u201cSo what, you were just passing by, saw me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard you were around, needed to talk to you and eat lunch.\u201d A shrug.</p><p>\u201cFunny how you hear things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, funny.\u201d The sentinel\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but Max had the distinct impression the leopard was laughing.</p><p>Max gave the changeling male a look that promised retaliation. \u201cYou have any specific addresses for these covert meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few\u2014they tend to move around.\u201d Pulling out a folded piece of paper from his jeans, Clay passed it over. \u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping an eye on the situation, but since it\u2019s accountants and teachers, we put it low down on the priority list.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at the list, Max noted that none of the locations correlated with Tulane\u2019s unexplained trips. \u201cThanks.\u201d Finishing off his lunch, he tucked the slip of paper safely in his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if anything comes of it.\u201d</p><p>Clay put his empty drink bottle on the table. \u201cHow\u2019s your J?\u201d His tone said far more than the words.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t leave the Net.\u201d Saying it out loud seemed to make it inescapably more real. \u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. I\u2019m sorry Max\u2014we would\u2019ve helped you if she\u2019d wanted to defect.\u201d</p><p>Max hadn\u2019t been part of any kind of a family since River disappeared, but he understood what this was, understood the value of Clay\u2019s offer. \u201cHer telepathic shields are close to total collapse,\u201d he found himself saying, the words torn out of him. \u201cShe\u2019s 8.85 on the Gradient, so when they fail . . .\u201d No place in the inhabited world would be safe for her. His Sophia\u2019s amazing violet eyes would go black under an avalanche of noise\u2014and then there would be only silence in his life.</p><p>Endless.</p><p>Relentless.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Max parked his car a block away from where Andre Tulane disappeared at regular intervals, and strolled down the cheerfully painted suburban street. The houses wore shades of bubblegum blue, candy pink, and meringue yellow, almost all with white trim. Human. Very human. The sole reason a Psy might wind up living amongst such brightness would be if there was some city ordinance that stipulated the colors in order to retain the area\u2019s historical character. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Psy understood the value of architectural tourism.</p><p>Seeing an old lady tending her winter-quiet garden a couple of houses over, he wandered across. \u201cA pretty face doesn\u2019t do it for me,\u201d she said without pausing in her task. \u201cNever has\u2014not since Bobby Jones broke my heart in junior high.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t much feel like smiling\u2014time was slipping by so fucking fast\u2014but he made his lips curve. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know who lives in number nine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s never done anything to hurt anyone\u201d\u2014a suspicious glance\u2014\u201cso you leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>Max frowned. \u201cHuman?\u201d</p><p>Her snort was inelegant, her words acerbic. \u201cYou think a Psy would live on this street?\u201d</p><p>Max made a decision. If it was the wrong one, it could tip off their quarry\u2014but Max had just remembered something else he\u2019d read in Tulane\u2019s recent history and realized the answer to this mystery might be both logical . . . and utterly inexplicable. \u201cThanks for your help.\u201d Turning away, he walked to the door of number nine and knocked.</p><p>The petite woman who opened the door had arms covered by computronic black carapaces and scars on her face that still bore a hard pink shine\u2014vivid against the naturally mocha color of her skin. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>Gut tight with the knowledge that he was right about Tulane\u2019s motivation for visiting this house, Max showed her his electronic ID. \u201cMs. Amberleigh Bouvier?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a guess, not given her physical condition.</p><p>\u201cYes. What\u2019s this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we talk inside?\u201d He could feel the gardener glaring at him.</p><p>A hesitation before she nodded and led him down the corridor and into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs this about Andre?\u201dshe asked, taking a seat at the table set by the window. When he raised a surprised eyebrow, she continued, \u201cI figured someone would come sooner or later, but I thought it\u2019d be another Psy.\u201d</p><p>Max leaned one shoulder against the doorjamb. \u201cI need to know the reason for Andre Tulane\u2019s visits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPenance,\u201d Amberleigh said in stark response. \u201cHis car blew a fuse and he lost control of it on a rainy night six months ago. Unfortunately, I happened to be on the curb when he drove over it.\u201d Amberleigh shook her head, her cropped hair blue-black in the sunlight. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it myself, so I can\u2019t expect you to. Everyone\u2014even I\u2014agreed it was an accident, but he said he was responsible, so he paid all my medical bills, made sure I got the best treatment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be back to full strength in another couple of months.\u201d She touched her face. \u201cAnd these scars are going to be all but gone after they heal enough to begin laser treatments.\u201d</p><p>Those treatments, Max thought, hadn\u2019t been around when Sophia had been a child. He might\u2019ve asked why she hadn\u2019t taken advantage of them as an adult, but he knew the answer\u2014it was a quiet, powerful rebellion. Sophia wanted to remember the past, remember the three children who\u2019d been lost. He was fucking proud of her for finding a way to speak even in Silence. \u201cWhy does Andre still come to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do any work around the house or yard that needs to be done.\u201d Amberleigh sounded bewildered, her eyes huge in that small face. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak more than three words to me, but by the time he\u2019s done, the lawn is mowed, anything broken is fixed, and my car\u2019s running smooth as Irish whiskey.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t need to hear any more. Whatever the demons that drove the quiet black man, Andre Tulane was deeply entangled with a human\u2014in direct violation of Pure Psy\u2019s aim of absolute racial Purity.</p><p>In the Pure Psy world, Max thought as he stepped out into the crisp afternoon air, a human cop would never meet, never love . . . and never lose a violet-eyed J.</p><p>CHAPTER 37</p> <p>There\u2019s always a price when you begin to ask questions. Sometimes, the answers aren\u2019t what you hope to find. And sometimes, there are no answers.</p><p>\u2014From the private case notes of Detective Max Shannon</p><p>on the file labeled \u201cRiver\u201d</p><p>Clay, having driven straight from lunch to take up a watch position around his alpha pair\u2019s home, looked at Sascha as they walked outside her and Lucas\u2019s cabin. He wasn\u2019t as close to her as some of the other sentinels, but he deeply respected the woman his alpha had chosen. She was strong, and she made their pack strong.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to Max,\u201d he said, continuing a conversation they\u2019d had on the phone on his way over, \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get his hopes up. But can Noor help Sophia?\u201d His adopted daughter\u2014the owner of a great big chunk of his heart\u2014was part human, part Psy. She\u2019d also formed a soul-deep friendship with another gifted child, Keenan. And that amalgamation of factors had created something amazing.</p><p>Sascha put a hand on his arm to steady herself as they stepped over a fallen log, easy with claiming the skin privileges that were a packmate\u2019s right\u2014but that she\u2019d never presumed on until Clay had told her it was okay. \u201cI asked Faith to see if her father could get us Sophia\u2019s medical scans after you called.\u201d</p><p>Anthony Kyriakus, Clay thought, was an enigma, a Psy Councilor with an apparent heart. \u201cHe came through.\u201d</p><p>A quick nod, a tendril of rich black hair escaping her braid to curl over her cheek. \u201cTammy, Ashaya, and I all had a look at them.\u201d Her expression was bleak when she glanced up. \u201cAccording to those scans, her organic brain is fine.\u201d</p><p>Ah, damn. \u201cThat\u2019s what the kids fix, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as we know\u2014yes. But the fact is, we\u2019re learning as we go with Noor and Keenan.\u201d She caught a leaf that had floated down through the gold-hued forest light, worrying it between her fingers. \u201cJs have also been a mystery since the dawn of their existence. My best guess is that the damage is psychic and cumulative. When I met her . . . I sensed this incredible will containing a vast pain.\u201d Her voice was taut, her bones strained against her skin. \u201cHer shields aren\u2019t broken\u2014they\u2019ve been worn away by a thousand slow drips of acid.\u201d</p><p>Clay shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cIs there anything that can be done?\u201d He wanted to help the cop who\u2019d been a friend to his mate when she\u2019d been alone, who\u2019d shed blood in the hunt to find a monster experimenting on vulnerable children like Noor.</p><p>Sascha looked so distressed, he knew the answer before she spoke, this empath with her huge heart. \u201cI was going to try to see if I could do something on the psychic level, but according to a note in her file, she\u2019s a minor anchor.\u201d A single tear streaked down her face, her sorrow so heavy he could feel it in his bones. \u201cShe\u2019s mainlining the Net\u2014and that Net is slowly going insane.\u201d</p><p>Clay released fisted hands to reach out and close one over Sascha\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDid she ever have a chance?\u201d</p><p>Sascha\u2019s fingers gripped his in painful sympathy. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Max returned to his apartment to discover that Morpheus had defected for good. The well-fed cat was purring happily on Sophia\u2019s coffee table when she let him in. \u201cI missed you today,\u201d she said with a smile, but he saw the shadows under her eyes, the new lines of strain on her face.</p><p>Heart tight with the force of what he felt for her, he waited only until the door was closed before cupping her cheek, before taking her mouth in a kiss that held as much savagery as tenderness. She responded with a moan low in her throat. \u201cMax, wait.\u201d</p><p>He bit her lower lip, furious with her for what she would soon do, the betrayal she would soon commit.</p><p>Her eyes shimmered. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the tears that stopped him. It was the way she said that, the way she looked at him. Not afraid of him, but for him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He gripped her hips, unable to let her go.</p><p>She dropped her forehead against his chest for a moment. \u201cWill you hate me, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery moment of every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Anger whiplashed inside him, at this woman who needed him to remember her. Didn\u2019t she know he\u2019d never forget? \u201cWhat,\u201d he said, his voice rough with rage withheld, \u201cdid you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>A long breath and she raised her head. \u201cWhile I was in the Net, I did some searches outside the parameters of the case.\u201d Those unusual eyes shifted away, then back. \u201cI found some information for you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t used to this kind of evasion from her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll stand by you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her fingers on his mouth. \u201cI know.\u201d Glittering eyes, a tone that left no room for doubt. \u201cI don\u2019t want this knowledge to hurt you . . . and I know it holds the capacity for enormous pain.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, kissed her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m tough. I\u2019ll survive.\u201d That\u2019s what he did\u2014survive. But this scar, Sophie\u2019s scar, was never going to heal.</p><p>She placed her hand on his cheek in gentle affection, and he knew she understood what he hadn\u2019t said, the hurt he hadn\u2019t vocalized. \u201cRiver may have been alive as of two years ago.\u201d</p><p>His heart stopped. When it kicked out again, he found himself shaking his head, his hands clenching on her\u2014he\u2019d searched for River ever since he became a cop, through every known database and come up blank. \u201cWhy would there be anything about him on the PsyNet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis path crossed with that of a human researcher doing a study on adults who\u2019d been drug addicts as children.\u201d Gentle words, a worried gaze. \u201cThat researcher\u2019s paper was footnoted\u2014and linked to\u2014by a Psy scientist\u2019s paper on Jax addiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2014\u201d he began, but Sophia was already pulling away to pick up a sheet of paper from beside Morpheus\u2019s purring body.

He looked up, to see her holding a small piece of notepaper. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone number of the researcher who wrote the original article. He\u2019s currently lecturing at the University of the South Pacific and is stationed in Vanuatu.\u201d There was a near-painful hope in her eyes. \u201cYou should be able to get him in his office a little later on, check if it\u2019s your brother.\u201d</p><p>Reaching forward, he tugged her into his arms, crushing the feminine softness of her to him, burying his face in her hair. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what this means.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dug into his back, her emotions as clear as if she\u2019d spoken.</p><p>\u201cYou do, don\u2019t you?\u201d he whispered against her ear, the scent of her a balm across his ravaged soul. \u201cYou know exactly what this means.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFamily, Max. You\u2019ll have family.\u201d Fierce, hopeful words. \u201cYou won\u2019t be alone.\u201d After I\u2019m gone.</p><p>Max clenched his hand in her hair, drawing back so he could look down into her face, so he could speak with his lips against hers. \u201cWe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have family.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled with light, with untrammeled happiness. \u201cMax.\u201d She pressed a kiss to his jaw just as his cell phone began beeping.</p><p>It was Bart. \u201cBonner\u2019s escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d Sophia stared at Max when he shut off the phone and told her what had happened. The prison was underground, all access points securely guarded. Even the emergency exits were set with pressure-sensitive alarms that would activate upon perceiving anything bigger than a field mouse.</p><p>Max\u2019s anger was a cold, hard thing. \u201cHe had an \u2018accident, \u2019 had to be taken to the medical bay. From the sound of it, he\u2019d been working on the doctor for months. He must\u2019ve convinced her he was innocent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven so\u201d\u2014Sophia couldn\u2019t imagine the sly evil that was Bonner back out on the streets\u2014\u201cthe doctor couldn\u2019t have had the necessary clearance to get him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she had access to tranquilizers\u2014she took out the warden, then ransacked his office for the override keys.\u201d Max clenched his jaw so tight, he could hear his bones grind against each other. \u201cManhunt\u2019s in progress and they\u2019re fairly certain he\u2019s driving the doctor\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>Sophia sat down on the arm of the sofa, her fingers digging into the fabric. \u201cAnd the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s lucky,\u201d Max said flatly, \u201cshe\u2019s already dead. If she\u2019s not . . .\u201d He knew Sophia understood better than anyone what Bonner was capable of, the pain that would be the doctor\u2019s reward for being foolish enough to believe in a sociopath.</p><p>A quiet nod. \u201cDo you need to join the manhunt team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can liaise with them from here.\u201d Bonner was not going to fucking steal Max\u2019s time with Sophia. And\u2014\u201cThey have the numbers on the ground.\u201d The team was huge and growing bigger by the hour. \u201cWhat they need me to do is predict where Bonner might go, update the search grid as we get sightings.\u201d The first thing that had come into Max\u2019s mind had been Bonner\u2019s twisted interest in Sophia. \u201cSophie, there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll head to you.\u201d</p><p>Sophia swallowed, nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you the majority of the time, and when I\u2019m not, I\u2019ll be in secure buildings. I\u2019ll take one of the security officers with me if I need to go out on my own.\u201d</p><p>He loved her for not making him fight to protect her. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s on the ground, so there\u2019s not much danger.\u201d But if he managed to get on a flight . . . \u201cI\u2019ll alert Enforcement here, let DarkRiver know so their network can keep an eye out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is Enforcement having such trouble tracking him? Wasn\u2019t be embedded?\u201d Sophia asked, referring to the transmitter all violent offenders had placed under their skin for the duration of their sentence.</p><p>\u201cHe managed to disable it soon after his escape\u2014most likely possibility is that the doctor dug it out for him.\u201d</p><p>Sophia took a deep, trembling breath. \u201cWill she\u2014the doctor . . . satisfy him for a period?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s stomach turned. \u201cHe\u2019s been behind bars long enough to have built up his needs.\u201d Refined his perversions.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to assist?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her anywhere near Bonner\u2019s evil\u2014she\u2019d walked into the void enough for ten lifetimes. \u201cTake another look at Quentin Gareth\u2014I have this gut feeling there\u2019s something we\u2019ve missed. Especially with Tulane out of the running.\u201d He told her what he\u2019d discovered at Amberleigh Bouvier\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cInteresting\u2014the dynamics of Nikita\u2019s workforce.\u201d A reflective statement. \u201cI\u2019ll look at Gareth\u2019s file now.\u201d</p><p>As she did so, he hunkered down to cross-reference the location of the D2 penitentiary with Bonner\u2019s known bolt-holes, sending the list to the manhunt team as soon as it was in any kind of shape. \u201cHe\u2019s smart,\u201d Max told the team over the comm line that he\u2019d secured, after discussing the possibility that Bonner might try to get to Sophia, so that they could put alerts on the relevant routes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go anywhere near his old hidey-holes.\u201d But the team would still have to check each and every one, just in case. \u201cI\u2019ve also sent you some properties I know were his, but that I couldn\u2019t ever legally link to him\u2014those were never in the police files, so he didn\u2019t have a right to see them during the trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck it, Max\u2014why can\u2019t he just die and do us all a favor?\u201d The lead on the team, a man who was legendary for never losing his cool, broke for a second before taking a calming breath. \u201cWe\u2019re sure the doctor\u2019s already dead\u2014dogs led us to a patch of forest not far from D2. Lot of blood.</p><p>\u201cSome of it was Bonner\u2019s\u2014they cut out the transmitter there. From the high-velocity spray, he thanked the doctor for her help by slitting her throat. He\u2019s never been this impatient before\u2014we didn\u2019t even have a chance to save her.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head. \u201cThe doctor was a necessity.\u201d A tool. \u201cShe was too old to satisfy him in any other way\u2014in his mind, she was probably happy to die once she\u2019d outlived her purpose.\u201d</p><p>The other cop shook his head in angry disbelief. \u201cWhat do you need from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny confirmed or credible sightings\u2014send the details to me as soon as you get them. Even a general direction will help me narrow down possible sites. With the amount of money he has at this disposal\u201d\u2014and Max knew there were Bonner family members who still believed in the innocence of their blue-eyed boy\u2014\u201che could go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got the airports covered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He might try to fly domestic\u201d\u2014especially if his fixation on Sophia was stronger than his drive to find other prey\u2014\u201cbut I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll leave the country. He enjoys being a star here too much.\u201d Ending the call after a few more quick words, he went to sit beside Sophia on the couch. \u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>Sophia couldn\u2019t stand to see the weight on Max\u2019s shoulders, the strain around his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt, Max.\u201d She cupped his cheek, her emotions stripped bare. \u201cBonner doesn\u2019t deserve to have you beating yourself up for his evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart.\u201d Max\u2019s kiss was so tender, tears burned at the backs of her eyes. It felt different\u2014more than sexual, more than intimate. If felt as if he was handing her a gift she didn\u2019t understand. Holding on to him, she gave herself to the kiss, gave herself to Max. When his lips wandered over her cheek and down her jaw, she shivered and wove her fingers through the thick silk of his hair.</p><p>Nikita could wait, she thought. The whole world could wait. Tonight, this moment, she was stealing for her and the strong, loyal, beautiful man who\u2019d seen every broken part of her\u2014and yet looked at her as if she was perfect. \u201cMax. Don\u2019t stop. Not today.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his head from hers, he rose to his feet in a smooth move that spoke of a very masculine strength. When he held out a hand, it felt impossibly right to place her own against his palm and allow him to lead her to the bedroom, to watch him put his fingers to the buttons of her shirt, slide them out of the slots one by one.</p><p>His knuckles brushed the side of one breast, making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d An intimate murmur against her neck as he dropped the shirt to the floor and moved to curve his body around hers from behind, a hard, sleekly muscled male with an arousal he made no effort to hide.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt more alive, more sensuous in her femininity. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His hands shifted up to close over her breasts through the practical cotton of her bra. \u201cIf I bought you naughty lingerie\u201d\u2014shaping her, possessing her\u2014\u201cwould you wear it?\u201d</p><p>Joy rippled through the sensuality, a piquant spice. He was as determined as her, she thought, to make this time theirs, something no one would ever be able to steal from them no matter what the future held. \u201cHow naughty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d He pinched her nipples lightly\u2014a quick, sharp bite\u2014rolled them between his fingers. \u201cThe pieces might even make you blush.\u201d</p><p>Heat was already rising over her body, but it was a languorous, seductive thing. \u201cThat sounds like a dare.\u201d Reaching back with one arm, she tangled her fingers in his hair, holding him to her. \u201cAnd I accept.\u201d</p><p>A smile she could feel against her skin as his hands slid off her aching flesh. Dropping her own arm to the side, she let him undo the clasp of her bra, then reached up to pull it down and off her body. \u201cWhy is it\u201d\u2014she shivered as he kissed the top of her spine, went lower\u2014\u201cthat I always end up naked while you remain dressed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A husky masculine chuckle, his lips moving over her shoulder, his hands on her hips. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a smart man.\u201d Playing his fingers across her abdomen, he undid the top button of her jeans. \u201cTake these off for me.\u201d</p><p>That slow, slumberous heat flamed, burned, but she took a step forward, lowered the zipper and then\u2014taking a deep breath\u2014pushed down both the jeans and her panties. Leaning forward to pull them off her feet, she could barely hear anything through the thunder of her heartbeat. Max didn\u2019t say a word until she straightened back to her full height. But then he spoke . . . and she melted.</p><p>CHAPTER 38</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d A rough sound, impatient hands that turned her to meet his kiss.</p><p>And oh, his kiss.</p><p>It held the same wild tenderness, the same protectiveness that had torn through her every shield from the very first. But it also held something else\u2014a raw, dark pleasure, a hotly sexual aggression. Shuddering, she pulled at his shirt. Buttons went flying every which way as he cooperated with her frustrated need to touch him, but his attention was on her mouth, his hunger inexorable.</p><p>His hands back on her body as soon as his shirt fell to the floor, he squeezed and petted until she broke the kiss, unable to take any more. But he wouldn\u2019t let her go. Kisses on her jaw, on her neck as he walked her backward, the heat of his chest an exquisite caress. She was more than ready to fall onto the bed when it hit the backs of her knees. Not waiting for him to nudge her, she crawled on and turned over to brace herself on her elbows.</p><p>He was watching her with a glittering kind of focus, one that made her skin tighten until it almost hurt. She swallowed as his fingers went to his jeans, as he undid the snaps and peeled the denim down his legs, along with his briefs. Her eyes were riveted to the thick length of his erection . . . to the hand he clasped around it. He stroked once, and her body arched. She couldn\u2019t explain it, didn\u2019t understand it, but the sight of him stroking his own flesh was the most erotic thing she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cMax.\u201d A shuddering plea.</p><p>Coming over her as she lay back in unspoken invitation, he lowered himself just enough that their thighs brushed, the hardness of his erection pushing at her abdomen in blatant masculine demand. Sucking in a breath, she slid her hands up the beauty of his chest and over those magnificent shoulders. \u201cYes.\u201d It was an answer to a question he hadn\u2019t asked.</p><p>But he understood. Relaxing his muscles, he allowed his body to touch her all over. The full-body contact was an erotic lightning strike, an electrical storm. Moaning at the pleasure-pain of it, she tangled her fingers in his hair and took his mouth in a kiss of her own. He shuddered against her, his hand clenching on her hip. When he moved that hand to push at her thigh, she spread her legs in silent invitation.</p><p>He touched her slickness, and it made her tremble. But he didn\u2019t stroke her with lazy patience as he had once before. This time, his touch was deliciously, demandingly rough, as he used his knowledge of her body to make her twist beneath him. \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmured, his shoulder muscles bunching against her palms as he played with her. \u201cScream for me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>She managed to tighten her thighs, trapping his hand in between. \u201cI,\u201d she gasped out, \u201cam not a screamer.\u201d</p><p>A wicked, unexpected smile, that lean dimple flashing in his cheek. \u201cWell now, a man\u2019s got to take that as a challenge.\u201d</p><p>She adored him. Tugging down his head, she pressed a line of kisses along the dimple, even as he began to tease her with small movements of his finger against her clitoris. Her breath caught. \u201cMax, you\u2019re rushing me.\u201d</p><p>The sensual complaint made him chuckle. \u201cFair\u2019s fair.\u201d But he withdrew his hand, leaning down to kiss her slow and lazy though his body thrummed with tension above her. His hair was a cool stroke across her skin as he moved lower, nuzzling at her breasts before taking a tight little nipple into his mouth.</p><p>It was an agony of sensation, and it was magnificent. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Grazing her with his teeth, he released the nipple. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, circling the wet nub with his tongue, \u201cwas close to a scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGasp,\u201d she breathed out. \u201cIt was a gasp. Now please do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Another wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he dipped his head to tease her neglected nipple, curving his hand possessively over the roundness of her other breast.</p><p>Shivering, she found she\u2019d spread her thighs again, that she was cradling him in the most intimate of ways. The depth of pleasure was a knife, sharp and edgy\u2014she shifted restlessly, her hands running up and down his back. Mine, she thought with a primal possessiveness, he\u2019s mine. Her hands touched his buttocks when he raised his head to kiss her on the lips, and she found she really, really liked stroking her hands over the sleekly muscled strength of him.</p> <p>A groan against her. \u201cStop that.\u201d He nipped at her lower lip when she didn\u2019t comply. \u201cOr I\u2019ll play the same game with you . . . in front of the mirror.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went motionless.</p><p>Max braced himself on his forearms, intrigued enough to fight the pulsing need of his cock, the drive to sink into Sophie\u2019s silken heat. \u201cSo, Ms. Sophia Russo has kinky fantasies about mirrors. Interesting.\u201d</p><p>Heat colored her cheeks, but she tilted up her head. \u201cTell me one of your fantasies.\u201d</p><p>He loved that she trusted him enough to not back down. Fighting fire with fire, he made a slow, deliberate move . . . until his erection nudged at her clitoris. Lord have mercy. It felt so good, he wanted to slip a few inches lower, take everything. But this was Sophia\u2019s first time, and he damn well intended to drown her in pleasure\u2014it was a matter of determined male pride . . . and of how much he felt for this woman.</p><p>Whose eyes drowned in black as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll distract me.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he kissed her, nuzzling at her throat as he spoke, \u201cYou know those suits you wear? The prim ones with skirts to the knee and jackets that button below your breasts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She made one of those little movements that drove him insane, rubbing herself against his cock. \u201cMy suits are boring.\u201d</p><p>It took him several seconds to find his voice. \u201cAu contraire.\u201d Husky words, his breath caught in his throat. \u201cThose suits give a man ideas. Like, for example, catching you alone in a deserted office\u201d\u2014he gripped her earlobe in a quick, teasing bite\u2014\u201cbending you over a big wooden desk, pushing up that sedate skirt to find you wet for me.\u201d The image drove him one step closer to insanity.</p><p>Then Sophie said, \u201cWould you touch me?\u201d in a sultry voice that wrapped around his cock and squeezed.</p><p>Shuddering, he lowered his head, sucked hard at her neck, leaving a little red mark. \u201cNo, this is a Neanderthal fantasy\u201d\u2014one of his favorites\u2014\u201cI just rip off your panties and thrust into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d She swallowed, wet her lips. \u201cI have . . . um, nothing against that fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Now that deserved a hot, open-mouthed, inferno of a kiss. \u201cI have another version,\u201d he told her afterward.</p><p>Fingers clenching on his biceps, her breasts rising up and down in jagged breaths.</p><p>\u201cThis time, I get you to stand in front of me, and I push up your skirt inch by inch, while stroking my thumbs along the insides of your thighs.\u201d Rising to kneel above her, he mirrored actions to words, parting her thighs to afford him the most delicious of views. \u201cI know you\u2019re not wearing anything underneath\u2014though sometimes, I let you wear silk stockings and a suspender belt\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her breasts turned a hot blush pink as heat rolled over her body. \u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>He moved his hands over her in a sweeping caress. \u201cShh, this is getting good.\u201d She shivered under his touch. \u201cAnd so I shove the skirt to your waist, bare you all pink and damp for me\u201d\u2014sliding his hands under her bottom\u2014\u201ctug you close\u201d\u2014positioning himself lower down her body\u2014\u201cand eat you up like candy.\u201d</p><p>And then he took her. Hot and deep and with an open possessiveness. She bucked under him, lush in her femininity, making small sounds of pleasure that urged him to drive her ever higher. But today, he didn\u2019t want her to go over without him. He needed to hold her in his arms, feel her pleasure. So when he felt intimate little muscles clench, her breathing alter, he took one final taste and rose over her body, his hand on her hip. \u201cTogether this time, Sophie.\u201d The words were so deep, so hoarse, as to be almost unrecognizable.</p><p>Sophia realized her cop had reached the end of his control. \u201cYes, oh, yes.\u201d Feeling wild and needy and hotly female, she wrapped her leg over his hip, opening herself even further for him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask again, kissing her with a gut-wrenching blend of tenderness and an almost violent need as he nudged at the entrance to her body. The sensation was . . . indescribable. It might have driven her to madness if she\u2019d tried it when they first met. But now . . .</p><p>Burying her face in his neck, breathing in the intoxicating blend of his scent, she gripped his body tight as he slid inside her. His entry burned a little, but that was a small thing subsumed in the agony of sensation. Shaking, she wrapped her other leg around him. The sudden act opened her up, made him slide inside faster than before.</p><p>They both cried out, and Max froze above her. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>She ran her teeth up the line of his throat. \u201cYes.\u201d Always, yes for this man.</p><p>Tugging off her hands, he twined them with his own as he pressed her to the sheets, his mouth claiming hers. She felt deliciously exposed and shockingly exhilarated as he flexed his hips and buried himself to the hilt inside her. Her cry was torn out of her, her body arching toward his in primal response. When he began to move, she tried to follow. She was a fraction of a second out of sync . . . but only for the first few strokes.</p><p>And then, there was no more thought. Just the slick, hot glide of his body against hers, inside hers, the rasp of his jaw against her cheek as he lowered his head . . . and finally, the turbulent beauty of a sexual storm that threw them both against the rocks and broke them wide open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey you.\u201d Braced on his side beside her, Max ran his hand down her front. \u201cYou look like a well-fed cat.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched up her face. \u201cThat is not a sensual image, not when I know it\u2019s Morpheus you\u2019re likely using as a comparison.\u201d</p><p>The tart response got her a kiss, a deep, intense claiming. \u201cHow\u2019re you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.

That\u2019s a high compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d Sliding one arm under her head, he draped the hand of the other over her hip. \u201cFor a Psy, you were okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t bad for a cop.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other, both of them utterly delighted in the moment. She wanted to snuggle closer to him, but her body was still humming with sensation. Better to wait a while, she thought, let things quieten a fraction. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he didn\u2019t pretend not to know the reason for her demand. Scowling, he did as asked. The tattoo ran along the length of his spine, a sword with the tip just below his nape and an intricate hilt at his lower back. It was a gorgeous piece of art.</p> <p>Fascinated by the spare beauty of it, Sophia pushed down the sheet so she could view the whole thing. \u201cWhen did you have this done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I was hot shit.\u201d</p><p>She considered the boy he must\u2019ve been\u2014tough but slender, his musculature still developing, and wanted to trace every inch of that tattoo with soft, adoring kisses. \u201cThe blade\u2019s so empty in comparison to the artwork on the hilt.\u201d</p><p>His muscles bunched. \u201cI left it blank on purpose. For you.\u201d</p><p>Her throat locked. She wanted to give him a gift, too . . . a gift as precious, as enduring. \u201cIt\u2019s near lunchtime in Port Vila. You could probably catch the professor in his office.\u201d</p><p>Turning to face her, he said, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Sophia stroked her hand down his arm, worried. \u201cWhy do you sound the way you do?\u201d As if he was holding something tightly in check.</p><p>He shuddered, bending his head so his forehead touched hers. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d A stark admission. \u201cWhat if it isn\u2019t River? Or what if it is . . . and he doesn\u2019t want to see me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would he reject you?\u201d Max had fought for his brother, tried to save him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that he went down the wrong path partly because of the guilt he felt at the way our mother always treated us so differently.\u201d River had been her golden child, Max the whipping boy. \u201cI tried to shield him from it, but I couldn\u2019t, not in the end.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s fingers twined with his on the sheets between them. \u201cIf this is your brother, if he\u2019s the boy I saw in that flash of backsight, he cares for you to the depths of his soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, that isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Max knew he sounded harsh, but it was the only way he could handle this. If he allowed it to matter, it would hurt too fucking much. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame him if he doesn\u2019t want to be reminded of the past.\u201d</p><p>Sophia squeezed his hand, leaving the decision up to him, those violet eyes warm with an intense, unbreakable loyalty.</p><p>In the end, there was only one thing he could do, his love for his tormented, damaged younger brother stronger and far more tenacious than the fear that sought to hold him back. Picking up his cell, he made the call\u2014the conversation with the professor took less than a minute, with the elderly man promising to pass on Max\u2019s details to this River who might be his brother. Hanging up, Max released a long breath and drew the scent of Sophia into his lungs.</p><p>The temptation to curl up around her and just forget the world was almost overwhelming, but the cop in him wouldn\u2019t settle. He\u2019d taken an oath, made a promise. \u201cI should let you rest,\u201d he said to the woman who was trying so hard to make sure he had a family, \u201cbut . . . want to come on a stakeout?\u201d His anger at being helpless in the face of her failing shields threatened to make him bitter, but he fought the ugliness, refusing to taint the beauty of this strange, beautiful joy between a cop and his J.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s face lit up with an almost childish pleasure. \u201cReally? Yes!\u201d</p><p>And he knew he\u2019d do anything in his power to keep that light in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said once he\u2019d checked in with the manhunt team\u2014no sightings, no information to help him narrow the search grid, his frustration as acute as theirs\u2014and they were on their way through the darkening city, \u201cword is, some Psy are having secretive meetings around town. No one knows why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to observe one of these covert meetings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Clay\u2019s informants say it\u2019s pretty certain the place we\u2019re heading to will be the gathering point tonight.\u201d The leopard changeling had sent through the message earlier. \u201cFor now\u2014we\u2019re just going to watch, see if we can get an idea of what\u2019s going on, gauge if it might be connected to the Nikita situation.\u201d</p><p>Not that long afterward, Max brought the car to a stop in the exclusive Pacific Heights neighborhood, parking between two other similar black sedans. This particular street was a historical landmark, maintained much as it had been in the early twentieth century, the trims on the graceful Queen Anne-style homes decorative, the colors distinctive even in the muted light.</p><p>\u201cThis is exciting,\u201d Sophia said, wide-eyed, just as the streetlights sensed the approaching night and switched themselves on.</p><p>Max bit the inside of his cheek. \u201cYeah, and don\u2019t think I take all my dates on stakeouts. You\u2019re special.\u201d Such an impossibly simple statement to describe the depth of what he felt for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201d A husky chuckle. \u201cOh\u2014I may have discovered what was bothering you about Quentin Gareth\u2019s file\u2014I meant to tell you after you got off the comm, but we got . . . distracted.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s body purred at the thought of that distraction. \u201cStill feeling tender?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, he closed his hand over her thigh, gave a little squeeze. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He could hear the blush. Then she said, \u201cAre you erect?\u201d</p><p>Hell. \u201cI should know better than to tease you.\u201d Grinning, even as he shifted to ease the pounding erection she\u2019d brought to life, he said, \u201cSo, Quentin Gareth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas a well-hidden discrepancy in his early records. It says he went to an Ivy League college from age eighteen to twenty-three, and he did. However, he wasn\u2019t actually at college for six months of his final year\u2014he enrolled in no classes, took no exams.</p><p>\u201cWhen I dug deeper, I discovered he\u2019d won a place in some kind of work experience program.\u201d She touched her fingers to the hand he had on her thigh, rubbing her thumb over his knuckles. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing inherently suspicious in that, but the fact that he hid it instead of putting it on his CV tells me he either did so badly during the program that he wants it gone from his work history\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014or,\u201d Max completed, \u201che\u2019s got a secret he doesn\u2019t want us to uncover. Where was he posted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s no record whatsoever of where he spent those six months.\u201d</p><p>Max caught something with his peripheral vision. \u201cStay relaxed,\u201d he said to Sophia. \u201cIt\u2019s dark enough that they won\u2019t be able to see us.\u201d Though the streetlight in front of the target home made their quarry very visible.</p><p>Two men and one woman walked up from the other side of the street, entering the house after a quick knock. Two more women, middle-aged this time, followed. The sixth attendee was a much older man, his hair in tight gray curls.</p><p>Sophia jerked forward without warning. \u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d</p><p>The individual who\u2019d caught her attention paused on the steps of the house, glancing around as if conscious of being watched.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Max murmured as Ryan Asquith shifted on his heel and walked inside.</p><p>CHAPTER 39</p><p>Councilor Kaleb Krychek was just getting into his car for the drive to his office in Moscow when he felt it. A telepathic ricochet. Catching the returning tracker with a psychic hand, he leaned against the vehicle. He had thousands of these invisible psychic constructs scattered throughout the Net, all of them primed to scan through billions upon billions of bytes for data for one name.</p><p>This was the first one that had returned since he began his search six years, five months, and three weeks ago.</p><p>He was careful with the old and fragile construct, not wanting to lose what it had brought back to him. It took him almost ten minutes to penetrate the layers of his own security\u2014and then, there it was. That name, linked to information that had passed through a distant part of the Net two weeks ago. The information was fragmented, the trail would be difficult if not impossible to pick up, but that mattered little at this point.</p><p>Because at last, he had confirmation that his quarry was alive.</p><p>CHAPTER 40</p><p>I\u2019m writing this as you sleep beside me, your breathing easy, the lines of stress smoothed away\u2014and I don\u2019t know how to describe what I feel for you. I don\u2019t have those words. It hurts, this emotion in my heart, this inexorable ache. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2014Sophia Russo in an encrypted and time-coded letter to</p><p>be sent to Max Shannon after her death</p><p>Sophia lay in bed the next morning, her limbs loose and her body utterly sated. So, this was what pleasure felt like, she thought in wonder. This was what poets wrote about and artists painted. This was why humans gave each other secret smiles and changelings murmured in their mates\u2019 ears.</p> <p>The bathroom door opened to reveal a tiled enclosure full of steam just as Morpheus jumped onto the bed and padded around to sit right up against her abdomen. She took the hint, stroking his solid form. \u201cYou shower in water far too hot for you,\u201d she said to the beautifully muscled male who walked out from the heat and headed to where he\u2019d thrown a change of clothes last night.</p><p>After they\u2019d seen Ryan enter that stately Queen Anne, she and Max had decided she should return home, tear apart Ryan\u2019s file. Her cop had called up a white-blond changeling male named Dorian to drop her home, while he\u2019d stayed on Ryan until close to three a.m., leaving only when his friend Clay had arrived to take the watch for a few hours. She\u2019d heard him return home, heard him confer with the manhunt team for over half an hour.</p><p>\u201cLooks like Bonner\u2019s parents provided him with access to a private jet,\u201d he\u2019d said to her when he stumbled into bed. \u201cBastard could be anywhere. I\u2019ve alerted the local airports, let the cats know.\u201d He\u2019d gone straight to sleep after that . . . but woken an hour ago with more than enough energy to make her gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll boil,\u201d she said, as another wave of steam escaped the bathroom.</p><p>An unrepentant wink. \u201cHeat is good for you.\u201d Towel hitched around his lean waist and hair damp, he looked young, incredibly approachable.</p> <p>A rumble against her palm as Morpheus began to purr. \u201cI was thinking about calling Quentin Gareth\u2019s college.\u201d Having discovered nothing incriminating in Asquith\u2019s files, she was staying behind today to sort through the PsyNet data she\u2019d cached\u2014in the hopes of unearthing something that might tie Pure Psy directly to the attacks on Nikita\u2019s people. \u201cBut if he has alerts set in place, it could tip him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold off on that,\u201d Max said, throwing the towel on the bed. \u201cI might be able to get the information another way.\u201d</p><p>The intimacy of watching him dress was a tightness in her chest. \u201cCome back to me, Max,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow could I resist?\u201d A solemn look, a kiss that held emotion that made her soul ache. \u201cYou\u2019re holding my heart hostage.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later and far too soon, Max walked to the door, with her behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the phone to the manhunt team throughout the day, too, so leave a message if you can\u2019t get through and I\u2019ll call back.\u201d Reaching out, he tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. \u201cBuilding security has Bonner\u2019s image\u2014they know not to let him up to you under any circumstances.</p><p>\u201cEnforcement\u2019s on alert, and Clay\u2019s also put the word out among DarkRiver\u2019s network of informants.\u201d A squeeze of her hip. \u201cIf you go out\u2014and I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t forget to take one of the security guys with you. Or better yet, call me, and if I can\u2019t get away, I\u2019ll call DarkRiver, organize a leopard escort for you.\u201d</p> <p>Remembering the warped arousal she\u2019d read in Bonner during the Gwyn Hayley scan, Sophia hugged her arms around herself, the tiny hairs on her body rising in primitive warning. \u201cI plan to stay in.\u201d Being outside in the general population was becoming more and more unbearable. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be entering the PsyNet, so don\u2019t worry about that either.\u201d</p><p>He touched his lips to her temple. \u201cHow are you?\u201d A rough question that held a thousand unsaid things.</p><p>She placed her hand over his heart, soaked in the incredible gift of his presence. \u201cStill here.\u201d But her telepathic shields were so thin that any touch by an unstable personality could perforate them.</p><p>A hard kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll check up on you every hour. Don\u2019t even try to stop me.\u201d</p><p>He was gone an instant later.</p><p>Knowing she should have protested, but reassured by his protectiveness, she fed Morpheus\u2014who graciously permitted her to stroke him once\u2014then took a quick shower. Afterward, refreshed, she changed into a pair of soft velour pants\u2014they were like nothing she\u2019d ever before worn. She\u2019d bought them on impulse several months ago, in a decision so non-Psy she hadn\u2019t required a medic to tell her she needed to go in for reconditioning. But she hadn\u2019t worn them until now.</p><p>The dark blue material was velvety soft, delicate, and beautiful against her skin. Enjoying the tactile pleasure, she put on a stretchy T-shirt, zipping herself into a hooded gray sweatshirt several sizes too large for her to complete the outfit. It wasn\u2019t cold in her apartment, but the sweatshirt was Max\u2019s, carried his scent.</p><p>Her cop, she thought, would never understand the depth of what he meant to her, what he\u2019d given her. It was at once a wild, earthy thing and an incandescent joy. The only shadow came from the knowledge that their time had almost run out, that one day soon, her mind would fill with noise and she\u2019d lose Max, lose the tearing power of the emotion that had made her whole, every broken part of her accepted and cherished.</p> <p>Her fingers clenched.</p><p>She forced them to open. It was no use being angry, no use railing at fate. Fact was fact\u2014she\u2019d gone through every manual, spoken to every one of her colleagues, all to no avail. Telepathic shields could not be rebuilt once they began to degrade from the core out.</p><p>\u201cThey use then discard us like garbage,\u201d a fellow J had said to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you accept the position?\u201d As an eight-year-old girl strapped to a hospital bed, Sophia had had no choice, but other Js did.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only available job.\u201d</p><p>Sophia had understood. \u201cIs it always the only available job when a J attempts to find work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Fury had made her gut twist. \u201cIn the past, before Silence,\u201d she\u2019d dared ask, knowing the J opposite her would\u2019ve been a historian if given the choice, \u201cwas it like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Js were only ever used in capital cases. Or if there was a hung jury where the crime fit certain parameters.\u201d</p><p>The load, Sophia had realized, would\u2019ve been spread, placing far less pressure on each individual.</p><p>\u201cJs still went mad, still broke,\u201d her colleague had continued, \u201cbut no more than the rest of our race.\u201d</p><p>But now the Council used them up in order to consolidate its power. In light of that brutal truth, Sophia wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to save Nikita, but Max was a good cop. He believed in justice, made her want to believe in it, too.</p><p>Her mind took that thought, connected it to a rumor tangled up in the information cache she\u2019d begun to process while she got out the ingredients to prepare a breakfast drink of the hot chocolate Max had bought for her. Interesting. Leaving the milk unopened on the counter, she found a piece of paper and, taking a seat on the sofa, began to note down the relevant facts as she smoothed out the \u201clumps\u201d of raw data.</p><p>The click of her door being opened was quiet, but it shattered her concentration. \u201cMa\u2014\u201d But it wasn\u2019t her cop.</p><p>Her eyes took in the security override key in the woman\u2019s hand, the Center badge on her lapel. No. She went to lower her PsyNet shields, send out a psychic mayday, but the woman\u2019s male companion was already gripping her arm, slapping a pressure injector against the vulnerable skin of her neck, his naked hand mere centimeters away. Her concentration fractured\u2014and they shot something into her bloodstream that turned her mind dull, sluggish.</p><p>\u201cUseful that Js have such solid PsyNet shields,\u201d the woman said, supporting Sophia under one arm while her partner took the other.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she on the rehabilitation watchlist then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer telepathic shields are all but gone. If she isn\u2019t rehabilitated now, there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll break on her own.\u201d They began to head down the corridor. \u201cAnd the death throes of the fractured are always so disruptive to Silence.\u201d</p><p>Sophia tried to resist their hands, the way they directed her like a rag doll, but her mind was mired in thick fog, her body refusing to follow her commands. They \u201cwalked\u201d her down to the garage level, each holding up half her weight. And the only thing she could think was that Max would never know how much she loved the scent of him.</p><p>Max jogged through the doors of DarkRiver\u2019s Chinatown HQ just as the skies opened up. \u201cThat\u2019s some storm,\u201d he said, shaking off the droplets that had managed to hit him.</p><p>\u201cForecast to clear sometime tonight,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cSo, what\u2019s up? Clay still shadowing that intern for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he had to switch with a guy named Emmett.\u201d Who had texted Max a few minutes ago to say that Asquith had arrived at work.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Dorian clicked his fingers. \u201cClay\u2019s holding a training session for some of the soldiers today.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cI hear you\u2019re good with computers.\u201d What he\u2019d heard was that the blond sentinel was an expert hacker.</p><p>Bright blue eyes blazed with an intelligence many people missed, being taken in by looks reminiscent of some teenage surfer. \u201cYeah? Where did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>Max tapped the side of his nose. \u201cYou have your sources. I have mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t work for free.\u201d Dorian folded his arms and stared meaningfully at the box Max had carried inside. There was a very feline look of anticipation on his face.</p><p>\u201cThanks for driving Sophie home last night.\u201d Max handed over the doughnuts.</p><p>\u201cI was working late anyway.\u201d He opened the box, drew in a long breath. \u201cWhat do you need on the computer front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you can dig up about a Psy named Quentin Gareth during a particular period almost twenty years ago.\u201d Taking out a notepad, he jotted down the details of the six month gap.</p><p>Dorian took a bite out of a jelly doughnut. \u201cGood call, coming to me,\u201d he said after swallowing. \u201cPsy often forget about the Internet. Lots of stuff cached all over the place.\u201d Taking the torn off piece of notepaper, he slid it into a pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll do the search now\u2014have a few minutes free before a meeting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCall me on my cell if you have anything.

At least he didn\u2019t torture her.\u201d</p><p>It was, Max knew, a small mercy. \u201cWas she found near the private airport where you think he boarded a jet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Parents are refusing to tell us where the jet might\u2019ve gone. The filed flight plan says it\u2019s heading to Greece, but that\u2019s a load of bullshit. Air Control hasn\u2019t got it on its systems, which means the Bonners were fucking ready with a plane designed to evade radar.\u201d</p> <p>Anger burned through Max\u2019s veins. \u201cI\u2019ve put a watch on some offshore accounts I know are his.\u201d Without a warrant and with the help of friends in the computronic crimes branch of Enforcement, but if it would help catch the Butcher before he killed again, Max wasn\u2019t going to sweat the ethics much. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t accessed them yet\u2014his mother\u2019s probably supplying him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBart\u2019s working on a warrant for her financials.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSightings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough the roof.\u201d A harsh sound. \u201cPeople jumping at shadows\u2014you know how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get him,\u201d Max said, able to hear the other cop\u2019s frustration. \u201cWe did it once; we\u2019ll do it again.\u201d Hanging up after a few more words, he ran out to the car, the rain pelting against his body. Shrugging off his wet suit jacket, he was driving through Chinatown when he realized he\u2019d forgotten his security keycard\u2014which allowed him full access to the Duncan building\u2014at Sophia\u2019s apartment. Figuring it\u2019d be quicker to pick it up than have it reissued, he thrust a hand through rain-damp hair and turned homeward.</p> <p>\u201cSophia?\u201d he called out as he wandered into her bedroom. The keycard was on the dresser where he\u2019d put his wallet the night before, but the bedroom proved otherwise empty. \u201cSophie? You in the shower?\u201d However, when he knocked, the door swung inward.</p><p>Worried she\u2019d decided to head out in spite of Bonner\u2019s possible presence, he pulled out his cell phone and placed a call to hers. It rang in the living area.</p><p>Ice crystals formed in his blood.</p><p>Closing his cell, he began to scan the apartment with the eyes of a cop. The food preparation area was clean except for the unopened container of milk on the counter. He stilled. Sophie was hopelessly neat, but it was possible she\u2019d forgotten to tidy it away while distracted by something.</p><p>Living area undisturbed. Organizer on the coffee table. And the bedroom, when he returned to it\u2014</p><p>His head snapped back to the organizer. Sophia might forget her cell phone, but she was never without that computronic device. Gut clenching with a fear so visceral he couldn\u2019t afford to feel it if he was going to function, he ran out of the apartment and straight to the security hub at the heart of the building.</p> <p>Entering using the override Nikita had programmed into his key, he had the Psy guard rewind the corridor feed. \u201cStop! Who are those two?\u201d</p><p>The guard enlarged the view. \u201cThe facial recognition software places the female as an M-Psy attached to a local branch of the Center, while the male appears to be a security expert.\u201d</p><p>Max shoved down his raging worry, focusing only on the lethal clarity of his anger. \u201cWhy were they allowed up?\u201d he asked, his tone a whip. \u201cI fucking warned you all that she could be a target!\u201d</p><p>The guard was already accessing the security log. \u201cAccording to this, they had an authorization which overrode our\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it up,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cThe authorization!\u201d It was a snapped command when the man didn\u2019t immediately understand.</p><p>The screen filled with a crisp document mandating the removal of Sophia Russo, Designation J, to the Berkeley branch of the Center for Comprehensive Rehabilitation.</p><p>Rage burned an inferno across Max\u2019s skin, but his mind remained mired in ice. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d He pointed to what appeared to be a coat of arms or an emblem of some kind on the bottom of the page\u2014a small square of black overlaid with a web.</p><p>The security guard went unnaturally still. \u201cThat\u2019s Councilor Henry Scott\u2019s new emblem.\u201d</p> <p>Max was already coding in a call to Nikita as he ordered the guard to send the location of the Center to his phone. \u201cNikita, Henry Scott is having Sophia rehabilitated,\u201d he said the instant Nikita answered, knowing Henry\u2019s interference would ensure Nikita\u2019s cooperation. Councilors, he\u2019d learned, were as territorial as changelings. \u201cShe was taken an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Nikita didn\u2019t ask useless questions. \u201cWhich branch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBerkeley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>He was in the car and screaming out into the rain-dark city by the time her voice came back on the line. \u201cThey haven\u2019t yet reached the Center.\u201d A pause. \u201cThey should have according to the time frame you\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to think, to focus. The rain hadn\u2019t turned torrential until about twenty minutes ago\u2014Nikita was right, they should\u2019ve reached the Center by now. And then, suddenly, he realized that Nikita should\u2019ve been able to contact Sophie on the Net. Everything stopped as he forced himself to ask, \u201cIs she still alive?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 41</p><p>\u201cHer mind is present in the PsyNet,\u201d Nikita said, \u201cbut she\u2019s not responding to telepathic hails.\u201d</p><p>Relief mixed with a cold, cold anger. If the bastards had hurt her\u2014\u201cI need you to find out the make and model of the car the Center people were driving so I can ask Enforcement to put out an alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have the information in minutes. I\u2019ve already notified the Center not to proceed with the rehabilitation order.\u201d</p><p>Thanking her, he hung up. But he knew Nikita\u2019s intervention wouldn\u2019t help, not if Sophia had been taken somewhere else. They could\u2019ve already\u2014No. \u201cHold on, Sophie. You just hold on.\u201d Opening his cell phone, he made another call. \u201cClay, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>The changeling male turned out to be at an indoor training facility at least twenty minutes closer to the Center than Max. \u201cI\u2019ve got several soldiers with me,\u201d Clay said, able to hear the incredible strain in Max\u2019s voice. But he knew from experience that the other man wouldn\u2019t appreciate sympathy, only practical assistance. \u201cWe\u2019ll head out now.\u201d Hanging up, he pulled a team together, and they drove out into the pounding rain.</p><p>\u201cPretty isolated,\u201d Kit said when they reached the road that led to the Center, his auburn hair appearing deep brown in the stormy light. \u201cVisibility\u2019s low.\u201d</p><p>And getting lower as thunderclouds continued to roll in, their heavy weight making it seem as if it was late afternoon when it wasn\u2019t yet midmorning. \u201cThis is the only way to the place.\u201d The Psy had located their new lobotomy facility in an innocuous building set on a patch of fenced land that DarkRiver had kept an eye on, but hadn\u2019t considered a threat because it had no obvious military or tactical function. \u201cIf they\u2019re not on this route . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Kit\u2019s cry came at almost the same instant that Clay pulled the car to a halt, reacting even before the proximity sensors detected the overturned vehicle on the road.</p><p>Getting out, Clay held up a hand to the packmates following in the vehicle behind them and ran to the wreck. \u201cI have a male on this side, injured\u2014fuck, it looks like his throat\u2019s been slashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here, except it\u2019s a female.\u201d Wiping the rain from his face, Kit looked at him over the top of the car as Clay rose. \u201cShe had an ID around her neck, with an M in the corner.\u201d</p><p>Rain pelted Clay\u2019s back in hard little bullets. \u201cI\u2019ll call Max, get him to send us the images\u2014\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s car screeched to a halt behind the second DarkRiver vehicle at that instant.</p><p>\u201cMan.\u201d Kit whistled, his lashes dripping rain. \u201cThe cop must\u2019ve driven at three times the speed limit. I didn\u2019t even know cars would let you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in here,\u201d Clay called out as soon as Max exited his vehicle, knowing from the white look on the cop\u2019s face that that was what he feared.</p><p>Max peered into the overturned car as if to confirm Clay\u2019s words. A second later, he bent, bracing his hands on his knees, his white shirt so wet as to be almost transparent. \u201cThank God.\u201d Shoving a hand through rain-slick hair, he rose to his full height. \u201cSophie looked like she\u2019d been drugged. If she got out, wandered off . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie, Nico, Dezi,\u201d Clay said, pointing to the packmates who\u2019d exited the second vehicle when Max came running over. \u201cDo a sweep, see if you can find any trace of Max\u2019s J.\u201d The heavy canopy of trees around them could have protected the scent trail from the rain. \u201cKit, you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d Desiree said, her tone gentle. \u201cDo you have anything of Sophia\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Max blinked rain from his eyes. \u201cI had a shower before I left home,\u201d he said, obviously aware that intimate contact could leave a detectable scent, \u201cjust kissed her good-bye. The fucking rain\u2019s probably washed away anything that was left.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Desiree stepped closer, her long, thin braids sleek ebony in the wet. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d At Max\u2019s distracted nod, she unbuttoned the top three buttons of his sodden shirt and pressed her nose to his skin, taking a deep breath. To his credit, Max didn\u2019t move. \u201cGot it.\u201d A fierce grin. \u201cShe\u2019s in your skin, Cop.\u201d</p><p>Jamie, Nico, and Kit repeated the process\u2014the men choosing to take the scent off Max\u2019s arm now that Desiree had confirmed it was in his skin\u2014before they scattered. Max glanced at Clay, his gaze piercing even through the rain-lashed darkness. \u201cThroats cut, what looks like oil across the surface of the road, this wasn\u2019t a simple crash.\u201d His words were practical, outwardly calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clay understood\u2014first the cop would find his mate. Only then would he give in to the demons tearing him apart. With that in mind, he followed Max\u2019s line of thought, his eyes on the oil. \u201cYou know anyone else who might want your J?\u201d</p><p>Rage turned Max\u2019s blood to fire. \u201cBonner\u2014the Butcher of Park Avenue.\u201d Forcefully wiping away the red haze that would just get in his way, Max moved around the car, checking for anything that might give him a clue as to where Bonner may have taken her. \u201cThe only good thing is\u2014if the bastard does have her, he won\u2019t kill her.\u201d No, unlike with the doctor, Bonner would play with Sophia in the cruelest of ways.</p><p>His hand fisted.</p> <p>\u201cThe car crash,\u201d Clay pointed out, raising his voice to be heard above the rain pounding on the wreck, \u201ccould\u2019ve gone very wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Max shook his head. \u201cIt was planned very well. Look at where we are\u2014right after a curve, so their speed would\u2019ve been low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car had to be on wheels for this to work,\u201d Clay said. \u201cAnd they were\u2014doesn\u2019t make sense with the rain.\u201d</p><p>Realizing the sentinel was right, Max examined the side of the vehicle, focusing on the section that he knew controlled the hover system. \u201cDoes that look like a bullet hole to you?\u201d He pointed to a distinctive hole in the plasmetal.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s another one,\u201d Clay said from the other side.</p> <p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve tailed them from the apartment, overtaken them at some stage to set up the oil slick,\u201d Max said, well aware of the Butcher\u2019s intelligence. He would\u2019ve checked his vehicle\u2019s nav system, discovered this road had no turnoffs, no side streets. \u201cAll he had to do then was lie in wait and shoot.\u201d Squatting, he stared through the broken wreckage of the car. \u201cThe straps in the back have been cut through\u2014but it\u2019s obvious Sophia was strapped in far more securely than either of these two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he was stalking her, Bonner would\u2019ve seen them strap her in.\u201d Clay\u2019s eyes were leopard-bright in the rain dark. \u201cAcceptable fucking risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor him, yes.\u201d Rising, Max began to consider and discard options, refusing to let Clay\u2019s anger feed his own. Not yet. He had to think, had to find Sophie. \u201cBastard\u2019s got money. His family\u2019s helping him stay on the run. He won\u2019t be out in the open or even in a cheap motel, but he\u2019ll be close.\u201d</p><p>Clay walked around to stand beside Max. \u201cIt would make more sense to take her as far as possible, give himself room to breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . impatient.\u201d Max swallowed his fury for the thousandth time, told himself he could scream at the heavens later. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to have her to himself as soon as possible.\u201d And if the Butcher touched her, the viciousness of him might just shatter her mind.</p><p>Forever.</p> <p>No. Teeth gritted, Max hunkered down, blocking the rain with his body as he examined the vehicle again. Bonner had apparently had no problem with the front seat passengers. Either one or both had been unconscious at the time. There were absolutely no signs of a struggle.</p><p>He moved to crouch beside the window that Sophie had been dragged through. That was when he saw something glint in the headlights of Clay\u2019s car, right below the window itself . . . where Bonner might\u2019ve braced his foot to gain leverage. He bent down, until his nose almost touched the earth, using the built-in light of his cell phone to illuminate the area.</p><p>Tiny particles that glittered and glimmered, having been hidden from the rain by the angle of the wreck.</p><p>Sand.</p><p>But there was something strange about it. Picking it up in between his fingertips, he brought it even closer to the light. Sparkles of yellow and crystalline red, along with the odd flicker of what looked almost like blue. \u201cClay!\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes fell on a tiny white shell just as the leopard ran over. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you got?\u201d the sentinel asked.</p><p>Max showed him what he\u2019d found. \u201cThe sand\u2019s not natural. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking a beach house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Clay took the tiny shell, brought it up to keen changeling eyes. \u201cI think this is coated with something. Protective plas would be my guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know of any place nearby that might use this stuff? It\u2019ll offer enough isolation that Bonner will feel comfortable\u2014but won\u2019t be too rugged.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the Butcher\u2019s style.</p><p>Clay\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cKit and the boys were laughing about some kind of a fake \u2018beach resort\u2019 about an hour from here.\u201d He pulled out his cell. \u201cI\u2019ve still got the web address saved. There\u2014says it has bungalows set \u2018discreetly apart,\u2019 laundry and room service.\u201d</p><p>All the comforts of home for a killer who liked to work without lowering his personal standards. It fit. Max rose to his feet, trying not to think about what Bonner might be doing to Sophia\u2014if he did, he\u2019d shatter, and Sophia needed him to hold it together. \u201cSend the location to my phone\u201d\u2014he was already running to his car\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll hook it into the nav system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d the cat called out after him. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue the search here, just in case!\u201d</p><p>He was five minutes into the drive\u2014too fucking slow\u2014when his phone beeped. It was Nikita, wanting an update. \u201cCouncilor,\u201d Max said, telling her where he was heading, \u201chow many teleporters do you know?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect help, not now that it was a human sociopath who\u2019d taken Sophia, rather than another Councilor\u2019s interference. But she said, \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can arrange.\u201d</p><p>Sweat trickled down Max\u2019s spine. I\u2019m coming, baby. Just hold on.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s stomach roiled, nausea filling her mouth. Drugged, she thought. She\u2019d been drugged. The Psy brain didn\u2019t react well to narcotics. A moan whispered out of her as she was jostled about, her already battered body unable to stop its jerky movements.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d A smooth, charming voice with . . . excitement, yes, it was excitement that bubbled beneath the surface. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. This road\u2019s the private one to my bungalow. Made to look like a natural pebbled road. They should\u2019ve sealed it. At least the rain\u2019s stopped.\u201d</p><p>Sophia only understood about half of what he\u2019d said. But she knew he\u2019d taken her, and that he wasn\u2019t a man she wanted to be alone with. He smelled wrong.</p><p>A laugh, almost amused. \u201cI\u2019ll shower when we get to the bungalow. Got a little sweaty and bloody saving your life.\u201d</p><p>A snapshot of memory, her legs kicking out in futile panic, her limbs too heavy to do much damage as he cut away the straps that held her in the car, as he pulled her out. Rain on her face. Glass on her legs.</p><p>Reaching down, she touched her thighs, touched the damp material that covered it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not injured,\u201d the man with the wrongness in him said as he brought the vehicle to a stop. \u201cA few cuts and bruises from the crash, but otherwise fine. Not even that wet. My arms got nicely sliced up coming to your rescue\u2014I\u2019m sure you\u2019re dying to thank me.\u201d</p><p>A buzzing in her head, a dizzying splash of words and images, her mind twisting out of control for a frightening instant as the drugs punched at her again. But she came to enough to flinch when the man exited his side of the car and came around to hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Lying, she thought, he was lying. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d she forced out through lips that didn\u2019t work right.</p><p>His expression changed, becoming mean in a way she couldn\u2019t describe. \u201cI\u2019m in charge now.\u201d His hand clamped over her upper arm, and he lowered his head, as if he would kiss her.</p><p>Even in the depths of her narcotic induced state, she knew that if she told him the truth, it\u2019d give him another weapon with which to torture her. But if she didn\u2019t, he might inadvertently break her mind, kill her by making her relive the horrifying ugliness of his blood-drenched memories. And she had to survive. Because Max didn\u2019t know. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, swallowing the nausea inspired by his mere presence. \u201cJ. Can\u2019t . . . contact.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his hand tightening on her arm. \u201cYou telling me direct physical contact can hurt you? Is that why you were always wearing those gloves?\u201d</p><p>She tried to nod, but her head fell forward, and she had so much trouble bringing it back up. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll just have to be careful.\u201d Unsnapping her safety belt, he lifted her out of the car and into his arms.</p><p>Her clothing protected her, but this close, her remaining telepathic shields shredded by the drugs, she couldn\u2019t help but drown in the fetid evil of him. He appeared normal, human. But he wasn\u2019t. He was so twisted up inside, so viciously mutated that he wasn\u2019t even close to human.</p><p>A slam, her body being laid down on some sort of a soft surface, that handsome blue-eyed face going in and out of focus. Her stomach revolted at the same moment, and she pitched over the side of what turned out to be a sofa, her stomach twisting in agony.</p><p>\u201cThere, there . . .\u201d He was wiping her face with a wet cloth, his voice solicitous. \u201cI\u2019ll clean that up. Let me take you into the bedroom.\u201d A smile that made her blood chill. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019ll be playing our games anyway.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 42</p><p>Take care of my heart won\u2019t you, Sophie? It\u2019s a little odd having it outside my body\u2014but I\u2019m planning to steal yours to make up for it.</p><p>\u2014Handwritten note from Max to Sophia</p><p>Max overrode his car\u2019s safety instructions for the fifteenth time but knew he was going to be far too late. By his calculations, Bonner was almost fifty minutes ahead of him. Even if he made the journey to the resort in half the time, that still gave the Butcher an eternity too long to torment a confused and drugged Sophia.</p><p>She\u2019d survive, he told himself. J-Psy were tough in every way. And his Sophie had proven her strength over and over. He\u2019d find her. There was no other option. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d just overtaken a sedan going at exactly the speed limit when there was a slight shift in the world to the right of him.

Where do you need to go?\u201d</p><p>Making a split-second decision, Max lowered the stunner and crossed lanes to the blaring of warning signals, coming to a full stop on the verge. \u201cTo Sophia Russo,\u201d he said to the man in the passenger seat.</p> <p>Councilor Kaleb Krychek wore a razor-perfect charcoal gray suit and had eyes of pure black filled with white stars. But unlike Faith\u2019s or Sascha\u2019s, his eyes were remote in a way Max simply couldn\u2019t explain. It was as if Kaleb had never felt, as if not even an echo of the boy he must\u2019ve once been lived in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI need a lock,\u201d the Councilor said, and they could\u2019ve been discussing the weather, not the life of a woman who had fought for her right to live every second of every day. \u201cI can only teleport to locations I\u2019ve either seen or have a recent visual of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you go to people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with certain qualifications.\u201d</p><p>Max held out his hand. \u201cTake her image from my head.\u201d</p> <p>Kaleb didn\u2019t touch him. \u201cYou have a natural shield.\u201d His tone said that that made taking anything impossible.</p><p>Not giving in to frustration, Max quickly routed to the Internet using his phone. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, bringing up an image of the beach resort. \u201cCan you get me there?\u201d</p><p>Kaleb brought out a slim device that appeared to be a high-end organizer and pulled up several more detailed pictures of the place. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There was no touch, no warning.</p><p>Max only just kept his balance as they appeared in front of the massive glass lobby that fronted the resort, the air heavy but clear of rain. The gaping doorman snapped his mouth shut. \u201cCouncilor Krychek,\u201d he managed to croak out. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware you had a reservation, sir.\u201d Max went through the door before Kaleb, heading to the desk.</p><p>Slamming down his ID in front of the receptionist, he brought up Bonner\u2019s photo\u2014from a newspaper story\u2014on his cell phone and showed it to the blond male on duty. \u201cWhich room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh . . .\u201d The man looked left, then right. \u201cI have to ask my manag\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she dies,\u201d Max said with absolute intent, \u201cyou die next.\u201d</p><p>Going sheet white, the receptionist shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle male, probably checked in within the past twelve hours, isolated bungalow.\u201d</p><p>The blond began working his computer. \u201cWe\u2019ve only had one arrival in the past twenty-four hours. But Mr. White\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>The ice in Max\u2019s bloodstream turned to liquid fire at the sound of that name, a name the Butcher had no right to use. \u201cWhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBungalow Ten, right at the end of the Eastern Route.\u201d The receptionist brought up a holographic image of the resort without prompting. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Bungalow Ten is here.\u201d He pointed out the locations. \u201cAbout a twenty minute walk.\u201d</p><p>Max saw Kaleb walk in, turned to him. \u201cCan you teleport there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis image is representational\u2014a 3D map,\u201d the other man said at once. \u201cI need a shot of the actual building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The receptionist spread his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything like that on hand. I could try our PR depart\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Max was already running through the doors.</p><p>Sophia rolled off the bed and began to stagger to the door. He hadn\u2019t tied her up when he went to have his shower, and that was his mistake.</p><p>Her leg went out from under her after three halting steps, her knee hitting the floor hard enough to send pain shooting up her leg. Biting off her cry, she gripped the edge of the bed and pulled herself up again. It took too long. She could hear him whistling in the smoked-glass enclosure a bare few feet away, obscenely cheerful, a man without a care in the world.</p><p>The bedroom door swayed then stretched sideways, making her grip the end of the bed for balance. Forcing herself to let go of the anchor, she lurched forward, desperate to get through that twisting, stretched door. She could almost hear it laughing at her. \u201cStop. Stop.\u201d</p><p>The laughter turned into chuckles. \u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Damp around her waist, skin so close to her cheek. She flinched, trying to hide her bare hands under her armpits.</p><p>\u201cNow walk back . . . there you go.\u201d</p><p>She knew she had to do what he said, because his semi-nakedness was on purpose, a threat. \u201cWhy?\u201d It came out raw, but it was also from the center of her brain, the part that hadn\u2019t been compromised.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer until she was sitting with her back braced against the headboard, her legs stretched out in front of her. \u201cYou fascinate me,\u201d he said, stroking his hand down her thigh.</p><p>Nauseated, she tried to pull away, but he pinned her in place.</p><p>\u201cWhen we talked before,\u201d he continued in a calm, clear voice, as if they were close acquaintances having an everyday conversation, \u201cI used to wonder what you were like beneath that Psy surface. I wondered if you were like other women or if you were more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugged,\u201d she said, her mouth full of cotton wool. \u201cNot myself.\u201d</p><p>Anger rippled across his features. \u201cNo. That\u2019s rather disappointing. I want to play with you. It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014we have time.\u201d He leaned in. \u201cYour skin is so clear, so lovely.\u201d His hand moved a bare centimeter away from the vulnerable flesh of her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose my playmate too quickly, but after so long, I just . . . can\u2019t resist.\u201d His fingertip brushed her flesh.</p><p>Gaping, screaming mouths.</p><p>Pleas. Whispers. Cries.</p><p>Earth, dark and dirty.</p><p>Blood spraying a wall. A thousand droplets of horror.</p><p>Sophia fought the spiraling whirlpool, knowing that this time someone would come for her, her cop would come for her. All she had to do was survive.</p><p>Max made himself come to a full stop a few feet from Bungalow Ten, his lungs burning after the sprint that had brought him here.</p><p>Instinct urged him to slam the door open and blast in, guns blazing, but he took two deep gulps of air, settled his breathing. \u201cWe have to be careful,\u201d he said to the cold-eyed Psy who\u2019d run beside him with a lethal grace that made it inhumanly clear he was a telekinetic. \u201cIf he\u2019s near her with a weapon, he could decide to kill her if we startle him.\u201d</p><p>Krychek looked at the building, no change in his expression. \u201cThe windows are curtained. How will you know what\u2019s happening within?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonner\u2019s ego was always his undoing,\u201d Max said, walking silently to the door and twisting the old-fashioned door handle with care. As he\u2019d hoped, the monster hadn\u2019t locked it\u2014the possibility of escape a taunt to his victim. Pushing it back a fraction, he chanced a look. Seeing nothing and no one in the living area, he opened it enough that he could slide in.</p><p>Not sure what Krychek\u2019s interest was in this beyond a cool intellectual curiosity, he left the Councilor to make his own choices as he toed off his shoes and sodden socks and crossed the living area on quiet feet, heading toward the semi-open doorway he could see on the other end. Pressing himself to the wall, he glanced in through the crack on the hinged side of the door.</p><p>Sophie.</p><p>She sat propped up against the headboard, her hair tangled, her face grazed and bruised. But it was the way she sat that worried him. Her head kept flopping to the side, and she seemed to have to force it back up. Her hands lay by her thighs, bare and unprotected from the monster who sat in front of her, his own hand stroking the air bare inches from her face. Torturing her.</p><p>Shoulders rigid with the need to put the stunner in his hand to Bonner\u2019s skull, Max was about to chance a shot when Krychek appeared beside him. The Councilor gave him a single nod, and this time, Max was ready for the teleport. He found himself standing in front of Bonner, his stunner pressed to the Butcher of Park Avenue\u2019s temple.</p><p>Bonner froze. \u201cDetective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop that hand,\u201d Max said in a flat tone that left no room for doubt, \u201cor I\u2019ll press the trigger.\u201d</p><p>Bonner\u2019s blue eyes went wide. \u201cYou sound as if you mean that.\u201d He jerked his arm.</p><p>Twisting, Max shot him through the palm of his fucking hand before he could touch Sophia again, exposing the whiteness of bone. Sophia wrenched herself sideways on the bed at the same instant. The situation under control, Max was about to shove the Butcher to the floor and cuff him when a screaming Bonner was slammed across the room to come to a crumpled standstill in one corner.</p><p>Max, having thrown his body in a protective curve over Sophia\u2019s, raised his head. \u201cHe was no longer a threat.\u201d He got on the bed, cradling Sophia to his side.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be a threat as long as he lives,\u201d Kaleb said, turning to watch Max and Sophia with a detached kind of focus that made Max wonder if he\u2019d exchanged one killer for another. \u201cIt makes logical sense to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough as makes no difference.\u201d</p><p>Max made a ruthless decision. \u201cStrip his mind. We need to know where he buried his victims so their parents can take them home, so they can grieve.\u201d He wondered if a Psy would understand.</p><p>But Kaleb Krychek asked no questions. \u201cIt\u2019s done. I\u2019ll note down the locations for you.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. Are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>Max looked at Bonner\u2019s crumpled body and felt nothing but a savage kind of satisfaction. \u201cNo.\u201d Maybe a better man would\u2019ve answered differently, but Max had never claimed to be a better man. Holding Sophia tight, he looked down, \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, her eyes closed, her lashes dark-moon crescents against her cheeks. \u201cI need to get her to a hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Krychek didn\u2019t move a muscle but an instant later, Max found himself standing in the middle of what appeared to be a Psy medical facility, Krychek beside him. The medics went motionless for a second before moving into gear. Answering their snapped questions as to what had happened, Max gave over his custody of Sophia\u2014but refused to move from her side.</p><p>He had no awareness of when Krychek disappeared.</p><p>Kaleb looked at the body of the human he\u2019d just killed, his fingers playing with the small platinum charm\u2014a single perfect star\u2014that was always with him, no matter where he went. Glancing down at the star, he said, \u201cFor you.\u201d For the one person who he knew better than anyone else on this earth, and yet could not teleport to, no matter how many times he tried.</p> <p>And he\u2019d tried every single day for over six years.</p><p>If others had been present in the room at that moment, they might\u2019ve wondered at the sweep of black that eclipsed the stars in his eyes, a black so absolute, it was beyond ordinary, beyond acceptable. But there was only a dead man in the room, so there were no questions.</p><p>Placing the star in his pocket, Kaleb contacted the authorities and made sure this incident wouldn\u2019t cause any problems. Given Gerard Bonner\u2019s predilections, he didn\u2019t have to push at all.</p><p>Then, when he was alone, he teleported to every location he\u2019d ripped from Bonner\u2019s mind to ensure he had the correct coordinates. Cold and desolate, each unmarked grave reminded him of the lightless rooms used by another killer, a sociopath who\u2019d groomed Kaleb to be his audience . . . and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.</p><p>Kaleb. Nikita\u2019s voice came into his mind as he teleported away from the final grave and to the deck of his Moscow home.</p> <p>It\u2019s done. Sophia Russo and Max Shannon are both safe. The gorge that fell away with jagged promise beneath the barrierless end of the deck called to him with the same whispered promise as the dark twin of the NetMind, the neo-sentience that was both the librarian and guardian of the Net. But Kaleb wasn\u2019t going anywhere yet. Not until he\u2019d tracked his elusive quarry, discovered what awaited.</p><p>Nikita\u2019s telepathic voice fluctuated in strength for a second. I apologize. I was speaking with the medical staff.</p><p>The J?</p><p>She\u2019s in a coma\u2014the drugs they used appear to have had a serious side effect. A pause. Thank you.</p><p>Kaleb could have reminded her it hadn\u2019t been a true favor, that he\u2019d get his payment, but he didn\u2019t. Not today. Are you certain, Nikita?</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him how he knew what she was going to do. There\u2019s no use fighting the wave. Those who do will drown.</p> <p>Some will say that you\u2019re the one who\u2019ll drown, smashed against a wall of Silence.</p><p>And you?</p><p>Kaleb looked down into the blackness of the gorge, but it was another darkness that he saw, the light blinking out in a woman\u2019s eyes as she begged for mercy. I think it\u2019s time.</p><p>CHAPTER 43</p><p>Now that it\u2019s come down to it, I find I can\u2019t say good-bye after all, can\u2019t bear the thought of letting you go. It\u2019s a selfish, stubborn need, but it holds me hostage.</p><p>\u2014Sophia Russo in an encrypted and time-coded letter to</p><p>be sent to Max Shannon after her death</p><p>Sophia felt painfully exposed, as if her skin had been rubbed off to bare her insides. Whimpering low in her throat, she opened her eyes. The lights stabbed and the voices, they were too sharp, too piercing.</p> <p>\u201cSophie.\u201d</p><p>She turned her unseeing, dazzled eyes toward that voice. And when he wrapped his hand around hers, she held on. Because he was quiet. He made everything else quiet, too. Gulping in a breath, she tried to think, tried to focus. \u201cWhat . . . happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re using other drugs to counteract the narcotics,\u201d he said, and she knew then that his name was Max. \u201cMedics say you\u2019re beginning to respond well.\u201d</p><p>Images, broken, disjointed, fell into her head. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty hours,\u201d he told her, deep grooves in his face that she knew hadn\u2019t been there earlier. \u201cI was starting to worry you\u2019d never wake up.\u201d</p><p>Her brain fought to slough off the lingering effects of the drugs, driven by what she felt for this man with his dark male beauty and his tenderness. \u201cMy body shut down to deal with the drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the M-Psy said.\u201d He glanced to his right.</p><p>Following his gaze, she saw the M-Psy beyond the glass, standing at a monitoring station. \u201cI\u2019m in a Psy hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a private one,\u201d Max told her. \u201cNikita\u2019s certain of the loyalty of the staff.\u201d</p><p>But no matter their loyalty, Sophia thought, they had to know she\u2019d broken Silence. By the sheer fact that she was gripping Max\u2019s hand, they had to know. \u201cThey\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Leaning in, he lowered his voice. \u201cI told them my natural shield seems to help anchor you.\u201d</p><p>She thought of that, pulling aside the cobwebs that threatened to suffocate her. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He was acting as a psychic wall, keeping everything at bay.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>But along with that understanding came another. \u201cI can\u2019t spend my life holding your hand.\u201d Her fingers clenched around his strong, capable grip. \u201cMy telepathic shields . . . I can\u2019t quite focus enough to test them. There\u2019s no way they could\u2019ve survived Bonner and the drugs.\u201d</p><p>His expression was grim. \u201cYou\u2019re not giving in on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and meant it. He was hers, the only person who\u2019d ever been hers. And he needed her, this cop who held his pain so close, his scars hidden deep. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you up.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>She knew from the way he looked at her that he wanted to press his mouth over hers, meld them so closely that nothing would ever again tear them apart. It took everything she had not to beg him to act on the desire. Because when Max touched her, she became alive, became human. \u201cI need you to know something,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Tell me on our wedding day.\u201d</p><p>Her mind swirled again, but this time, it was a different kind of a dance, inciting an odd breathlessness. \u201cI once testified in a case where the prosecutor showed a video taken at a Greek wedding\u201d\u2014because the accused had been seen there in the company of the woman he\u2019d eviscerated an hour later, but she didn\u2019t want to focus on the darkness then\u2014\u201cand there was a part where they all threw plates on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed, the lean dimple she so loved coming out of hiding. \u201cYou want to throw plates on the floor at our wedding, baby, I\u2019ll buy you a damn crate of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wanted to echo his laugh, trace her finger over his lips. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to get married within the walls of the place we decide to call home.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s expression changed, becoming savagely masculine. \u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>With the counteragents acting with remarkable speed, Max intended to take Sophia home later that day so she could heal in privacy, but the M-Psy refused to release her. \u201cLook,\u201d Max finally snapped, his temper hanging on by a thread so thin, it was close to invisible, \u201cshe\u2019s got no physical injuries aside from a few cuts and bruises, and the side effects from the drugs are all but gone.\u201d In spite of his wrenching need to hold her, he\u2019d never have suggested taking her home otherwise. \u201cWhy does she need to remain here?\u201d</p><p>The M-Psy looked at Sophia. \u201cI need to discuss that privately with Ms. Russo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my partner.\u201d Max was going to have trouble leaving Sophie alone for a long time coming. \u201cAnd she\u2019s already been subject to attack while in a supposedly secure location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of her hand,\u201d the medic said.</p><p>Max squeezed Sophia\u2019s fingers. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sophia looked at the M-Psy, then back at Max. \u201cDo it slowly,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to tell if there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>Protective instincts rebelled. \u201cSophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must know.\u201d Her eyes said far more than her words.</p><p>Sweat broke out along his spine as he released his grip until only their fingertips touched\u2014then Sophia broke even that contact. He was ready to clasp her wrist at the first sign of trouble but she stared at him before turning her attention to the M-Psy. \u201cI should be dead. The voices should have crashed into my mind\u2014but I can\u2019t hear even a whisper.\u201d The jagged, splintered thoughts that had stabbed into her mind when she first woke were held far at bay, her mind a clear, pristine pond.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d The M-Psy put down the electronic file in his hand. \u201cAccording to the records I\u2019ve accessed, your shields were a cause for grave concern\u2014to the point where you were on a rehabilitation watchlist. Yet according to my scans, those shields are now airtight.\u201d</p><p>Max sucked in a breath beside her, his tall frame held taut. \u201cIs he right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me outside, Max,\u201d she said, curling her fingers into the bed beneath the sheets when they would\u2019ve reached for her cop. \u201cI need to be certain.\u201d</p><p>A cool breeze stroked its way across Sophia\u2019s face as Max wheeled her onto the roof of the private hospital. It was tinged with the salt of the sea and the living beat that was the population of this vibrant city. A thousand smells lingered in the air, from the sweetness of cotton candy to the briny tang of fish, to the wild spice of some exotic restaurant. Noises, too, rose up from the ground. The smooth shush of vehicles, the heavy pulse of conversation flowing between thousands of people, the odd siren as emergency vehicles went about their tasks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all outside,\u201d she whispered, unable to believe it. Nothing crashed against her skull, or if it did, her shields were so incredibly strong that she didn\u2019t feel even an echo. \u201cTake me farther, Max.\u201d</p><p>As he pushed the chair forward, she dared try and manipulate whatever it was that was protecting her, opening the steel walls a mere fraction. Fragments of noise, slivers of thought. She snapped the walls shut. \u201cThere\u2019s no question\u2014I have functional shields.\u201d Gripping the chair arms, she rose out of the chair. \u201cHighly functional shields.\u201d Better than she\u2019d ever had, even as a child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max had his hand out to catch her even as the M-Psy remonstrated with her. She didn\u2019t care. Standing shakily on her feet, she took a deep, deep breath . . . and let the beat of the city flow around her. \u201cI\u2019m free,\u201d she said, though she knew it wasn\u2019t as simple as that. The J Corps wouldn\u2019t release her, not now that she was useful again. But\u2014\u201cAnd I\u2019ll fight to keep my freedom.\u201d No more acid on her soul. No more.</p><p>Max\u2019s expression held mingled joy and determination, and she heard the words he didn\u2019t say, even as the M-Psy spoke. \u201cYou should sit back down, Ms. Russo.\u201d</p><p>Since her legs felt a little unsteady, she didn\u2019t argue. \u201cDo you have any idea why my shields have regenerated?\u201d</p> <p>The M-Psy shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to keep you here longer\u2014shields as badly damaged as yours shouldn\u2019t regenerate. I\u2019ve looked through all our archives without finding another case. I\u2019m concerned the shield will fail again as quickly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Sophia said, looking back out over the city, \u201cI\u2019d rather use this time as wisely as I can. Not many Js get a second chance.\u201d</p><p>The M-Psy glanced at his chart. \u201cI can only release you if you\u2019ll have someone with you at all times over the next twenty-four hours. The drugs could rebound, trigger a blackout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s never alone,\u201d Max said, his tone implacable. \u201cSign her out.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, Sophia found herself in the passenger seat of Max\u2019s car, being driven back to the apartment. \u201cI\u2019ve lit a fire under security,\u201d he said, his jaw set in a grim line. \u201cNobody reaches you without having being cleared by me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMax, I know you said to wait for our wedding day, but I really want to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s hands tightened on the wheel. \u201cYou\u2019re always in a rush, aren\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>With Max, yes, she thought, she was both impatient and greedy. \u201cI love the way you smell.\u201d</p><p>A startled look. \u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Smiling, content, she closed her eyes and gave in to the slumber that had been pushing at her ever since they entered the vehicle.</p><p>She had no awareness of reaching the apartment building, no awareness of being carried up to her bedroom and laid down in bed. Nor did she feel the kiss pressed to her forehead or hear the low, shaken whispers of a man who told her she was his everything.</p> <p>Max sat on Sophia\u2019s sofa, able to think about Nikita\u2019s case for the first time since the nightmare of the abduction. After what Nikita had done to save Sophia, he owed the Councilor far more than what was obligated by his position as an Enforcement detective.</p><p>However, though Nikita had been in touch with him on and off over the past day, he\u2019d withheld the information about Ryan Asquith\u2019s attendance at a Pure Psy meeting\u2014gut instinct said the boy was no killer and he\u2019d probably splinter under Nikita\u2019s version of a \u201cchat.\u201d At most, the intern was a mole, one who might lead them to the kingpin.</p><p>But Max had told Nikita about Quentin Gareth, warned her to watch her back until they could determine where the prematurely silver-haired man had been for those unaccounted-for months in his past.</p><p>\u201cQuentin\u2019s in Jordan for business,\u201d Nikita had told him. \u201cHe won\u2019t be back for three more days, so we have time to unearth the truth\u2014I\u2019ve already begun deep-level PsyNet scans in relation to this issue.\u201d</p><p>Wondering if she\u2019d had any luck, he picked up his cell phone and put through a call. However, the office comm line, her private line, the cell, they all went to voicemail. He was about to try her assistant when his phone rang in his hand. Glancing at it, he raised an eyebrow. \u201cRyan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Shannon, as you kept our previous discussion confidential,\u201d the intern said without any lead in, \u201cI feel I can trust you with this.\u201d</p><p>Max waited.</p><p>\u201cI was approached by an individual associated with Pure Psy after my reconditioning last year\u2014they believed I would be open to their message.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood way to pick up recruits.\u201d Ryan had killed when his powers went out of control, would\u2019ve been\u2014on some level\u2014searching for something to make the world seem right again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ryan paused. \u201cAt first, I went along, but I soon realized my goals didn\u2019t match theirs. However, just as I was about to resign my membership, I got the internship with Councilor Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spying for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot officially. She doesn\u2019t know.\u201d A long breath. \u201cI wanted to bring her something that would make her more inclined to keep me on after this internship ends.\u201d</p><p>Either the boy was honestly pinning his hopes of survival on Nikita, or he was a very good liar. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing concrete . . . but there was an \u2018atmosphere\u2019 at the last meeting I attended, a sense of anticipation. I believe that while the members aren\u2019t aware of the details of what\u2019s about to take place, something is.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up after it became clear the intern could tell him nothing more, Max began to check the myriad of messages that had come in during the time he\u2019d been in the hospital with Sophia, his hand locked tight around hers.</p><p>There was an e-mail from Dorian.</p><p>Found a cached note on an old server saying that Gareth won a 6 month internship at KTech Inc. (London). Matches with the time period you\u2019re looking at. All legit. But someone went to a hell of a lot of trouble to hide it.</p><p>A second message showed up as coming in only ten minutes ago.</p><p>Cop, I hope your girl is okay. Call me.</p><p>Max input the code. Dorian picked up on the first ring. \u201cHow\u2019s Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, really good.\u201d His heart twisted, part of him still unable to believe his Sophie was safe. \u201cSo, what\u2019ve you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry this is coming in late,\u201d Dorian said. \u201cA motorcycle slid in the rain, broadsided a couple of our soldiers a few minutes after I sent the first e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken arm, broken leg, but they\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve been covering their shifts.\u201d A pause, the rustle of paper. \u201cAnyway, I just did some more digging on this KTech Inc. It\u2019s owned by a shell company, which is owned by a shell company ad nauseum. But behind it all, KTech is part of Scott Inc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in Henry and Shoshanna,\u201d Max completed, all the pieces clicking into place. According to the confidential file Nikita had given Sophia, Henry was the Councilor most involved with Pure Psy. It wasn\u2019t quite a smoking gun when it came to the murders, but it was close enough to put Gareth squarely in the crosshairs. \u201cThanks, Dorian.\u201d Hanging up, he was about to try Nikita again when he noticed a piece of paper by his foot, as if it had fallen off the coffee table.</p><p>Picking it up, he saw Sophia\u2019s handwriting.</p><p>Gareth. Rumor. Pr</p><p>There was nothing else. She\u2019d clearly been interrupted before she could finish the thought. Fighting a rush of possessive protectiveness when he realized it had to have happened the morning of her abduction, he glanced into the bedroom, saw that she was sleeping peacefully. There was, he thought with a wrench deep in his heart, no need to disturb her. Except . . . it had to be important if she\u2019d left the milk unopened on the counter to write it\u2014and his Sophie, the gutsy woman who\u2019d refused to give in to a sociopath, was strong enough to handle this.</p><p>Going to kneel beside the bed, he cupped her cheek, the thin lines of her scars a familiar pattern. \u201cSophie?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help tracing the lines with a string of tender kisses.</p><p>She stirred, her eyes obviously heavy as she opened them. \u201cMmm?\u201d Beside her, Morpheus\u2014who hadn\u2019t left her side since she came home\u2014shot him a jaundiced look.</p><p>\u201cYou heard a rumor about Quentin Gareth.\u201d He dropped little kisses on the corners of her mouth. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>Another small sound, and she snuggled closer.</p><p>\u201cReport from Prague,\u201d she muttered, as if in her sleep. \u201cVague rumor.\u201d She turned toward his mouth, a kitten seeking more affection.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rumor, sweetheart?\u201d He brushed her hair off her face, petting her with more kisses. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGareth might\u2019ve killed a student four months ago.\u201d It was a crystal-clear statement. \u201cStudent was on a Center short list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was considered flawed,\u201d Max murmured out loud.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>If the rumor was true, Max realized, Quentin wasn\u2019t simply a calculating, high-level mole for Henry Scott, he was a fanatic who believed absolutely in Pure Psy. And that kind of an individual could snap if he sensed any type of a\u2014</p><p>The doorbell chimed.</p><p>CHAPTER 44</p><p>The first thing Max realized was that Security hadn\u2019t called up\u2014every instinct he had went on high alert. \u201cSophie, sweetheart, wake up.\u201d Shoving off the blankets, he picked her up and carried her into the bathroom, sitting her down with her back against the wall beside the sink. Morpheus followed on silent feet.</p><p>Flicking a few drops of water onto Sophia\u2019s face, he roused her. \u201cLock the door behind me, and stay here until I come for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her gaze was still a little dazed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m being a paranoid fool, but maybe we have some bad company.\u201d Taking his spare stunner from his boot, he put it in her hand. \u201cJust press this if someone comes for you. And take my cell phone\u2014call Enforcement if things turn to shit.\u201d The doorbell chimed again as he put the cell phone in her lap. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>At her nod, he pulled the door closed and waited until he heard the lock snick into place before he walked out to the front. He wasn\u2019t surprised to check the surveillance and find Nikita on the other side, with Quentin Gareth beside her. \u201cNikita,\u201d he said, opening the door, his stunner hidden by his side. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cQuentin has a stunner held flush to the back of my skull,\u201d Nikita said, frigidly unruffled.</p><p>Max took a step back as Gareth urged Nikita into the apartment. Max saw Nikita\u2019s eyes sweep the room, wondered what she was searching for. \u201cSophia\u2019s not here,\u201d he said, testing Gareth\u2019s reaction. \u201cThe medics wouldn\u2019t release her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer brain\u2019s likely mush by now in any case,\u201d the other male said, his eyes glittering in a way that spoke of a disordered mind that had lost any sense of reality. \u201cDetective, if you don\u2019t want the Councilor\u2019s brains to leak out her ears, too, please place your own weapon on the coffee table.\u201d</p><p>Max did as asked, having caught Nikita\u2019s eye. For some reason, she was cooperating with Gareth. What, he thought, would make a woman of Nikita\u2019s power hold her fire?</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Gareth said as Max drew away from the coffee table. \u201cStand against the counter.\u201d</p><p>Max did so, facing Gareth. \u201cWhat\u2019re you planning to do now?\u201d He heard something from the bedroom, felt his spine lock as he realized Sophia had exited the bathroom.</p><p>But Gareth didn\u2019t seem aware of anything but his mission. \u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Henry, I assume,\u201d Nikita said. \u201cDoes he really think you have the ability to dispose of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI press this trigger, and your brain is so much liquid three seconds later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve infected you,\u201d Nikita said quietly while Max, for the first time in his life, wished that he\u2019d been born a telepath. What the fuck was Sophia thinking? \u201cYour mind,\u201d Nikita added, \u201cis already being consumed by a mental virus.\u201d</p><p>Gareth\u2019s hand didn\u2019t tremble, though the odd shine in his eyes seemed to flare even brighter. \u201cI expected as much. It will be a small price to pay to save the Net.\u201d</p><p>Martyrs, Max knew, were even more dangerous than fanatics.</p><p>\u201cIs Sascha dead?\u201d Nikita asked, giving Max the information he needed.</p><p>\u201cNo. But she\u2019s in our control. She won\u2019t be harmed if you do exactly as ordered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s alive,\u201d Nikita continued, \u201cI should be able to reach her telepathically, and I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a creature of habit, Nikita\u2014I spiked the water jug in your office with a drug that\u2019s temporarily dampened your range.\u201d A pause. \u201cIt\u2019s a variant of Jax, still experimental, so I hope you didn\u2019t drink more than your usual single glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you have possibly reached Sascha?\u201d Max asked, hoping like hell that Sophia would keep herself hidden. Quentin Gareth was insane, but he was still in full control of that weapon. \u201cShe\u2019s surrounded by DarkRiver cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shot the DarkRiver alpha as he drove her home. It was easy to take her.\u201d</p><p>And Max knew without a doubt that Gareth was lying. Because if Lucas was dead and Sascha missing, Dorian would\u2019ve been hunting Gareth down with the lethal rage of a leopard in stalking mode, not running a search for Max. \u201cHe\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>Nikita met his gaze. \u201cI need to be certain, Detective. Quentin informs me that if he tells his superiors he\u2019s been taken, or if his star disappears from the Net, Sascha will be put to death.\u201d</p><p>Max saw the bedroom door begin to open. Shifting to the left in a sudden move, he made Gareth swivel toward him\u2014though the man continued to use Nikita as a shield. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go for your stunner, Detective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to question you in order to ensure you didn\u2019t share classified information about our cause, but you\u2019re not indispensible.\u201d</p><p>A tiny squeak as the bedroom door opened farther, but Max was already talking. \u201cWhat\u2019s your master promised you?\u201d The choice of words was deliberate. \u201cA position of power? Money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat question shows you know nothing about me. I\u2019m doing this for the good of the Psy race.\u201d And then at last, he confirmed his allegiance to Pure Psy. \u201cPurity will save us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI called Faith.\u201d It was a husky statement from the bedroom doorway. \u201cSascha\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>What happened next was so fast, so deadly, Max was never quite able to put the sequence of events in order. A stunner blast hit Gareth from the bedroom, the pulse glancing off him as Sophia\u2019s arm trembled. At the same time, or an instant later, Nikita went to her knees, even as Max\u2019s hand closed around the stunner on the coffee table. He turned, his shot, set to stun, hitting Gareth square in the chest . . . but the male was already falling, blood pouring out of his ears, his eyes, his nose.</p><p>Rising to her feet as Gareth crashed onto the floor, his body twitching in the throes of death, Nikita coded in a call on her cell phone. \u201cSascha,\u201d she said as Max ran to Sophia, \u201cI wanted to ask if you received the contracts I sent last night.\u201d A pause. \u201cExcellent.\u201d Hanging up, Nikita looked down at Gareth\u2019s corpse with an utterly dispassionate gaze. \u201cHenry is very good at telepathic wipes. He made sure Quentin carried no memories I could use to pin this on him, but I know he was behind it.\u201d</p><p>Max placed Sophia gently against the wall and looked up at the woman who\u2019d just destroyed a man\u2019s brain in a splintered second. \u201cI guess the drugs didn\u2019t dampen your range enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA miscalculation on their part. It only affected my long-range sending abilities.\u201d</p><p>And Gareth had been standing right next to her. \u201cHe was the only one. Marsha\u2019s blood loyal and Tulane\u2019s clean\u2014I\u2019d keep an eye on the intern, but my gut says he\u2019s more apt to give you his devotion than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to keep an eye on everyone,\u201d Nikita said, redoing the single button on her jacket with an efficiency that told Max the dead man on the floor had already been dismissed from her thoughts. \u201cHowever, you would be very good at it.\u201d</p><p>Max blinked. \u201cAre you offering me a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a security chief. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to. \u201cI\u2019m a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can remain one\u2014Enforcement people have been known to be seconded onto a Councilor\u2019s private team. I\u2019m willing to be flexible if you wish to continue to keep track of your old cases.\u201d Her gaze switched to Sophia. \u201cMs. Russo\u2014the Corps has requested I release you as soon as possible so that you can be returned to the active roster.\u201d</p><p>With that detached reminder that Sophia was once again a functioning J, expected to walk into the abyss again and again and again, Nikita headed to the door. \u201cA cleanup crew will arrive shortly. You may want to move into your apartment for the time being. And ensure that large black feline doesn\u2019t taste Quentin\u2019s blood\u2014my viruses have never transmitted through organic matter, but I can\u2019t guarantee that.\u201d</p><p>With those chill words, she was gone. Helping Sophia to her feet, Max walked them out of the apartment and into his own. Morpheus had too much class to lick at Gareth\u2019s blood. Turning up his nose at the lifeless Psy, he padded into the neighboring apartment behind Max and Sophia.</p><p>Max was just taking a sip of his coffee the next morning before attempting to get in touch with Kaleb Krychek when security dropped off his mail. Checking it, he saw that his super in Manhattan had forwarded what felt like a couple of letters in a bigger envelope.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sophia asked as he took a seat beside her on the sofa. She\u2019d had a good night\u2019s sleep, shaken off the final side effects of the drugs.</p><p>Max reached out to run his hand through her hair, unable to stop touching her. \u201cProbably bills,\u201d he said with a shrug that tried to be careless.</p><p>He knew he\u2019d failed when Sophia touched his shoulder. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to track down my father,\u201d he told her, admitting his final secret. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. Maybe I\u2019ll know when I find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think the information is in that envelope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way to know\u2014but each time I open a \u2018mystery\u2019 envelope,\u201d he said, looking down at the plain brown paper, \u201cI hope.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shifted to snuggle by his side. It was automatic to put his arm around her, pull her tight against him. She fit perfectly. \u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d A soft statement from the Psy who owned his heart. \u201cYour expression . . .\u201d</p><p>He stole a kiss, needing her. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to read me like a book. By the time we\u2019re sitting in rockers watching our grandchildren play, you\u2019ll know my secrets before I do.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and it hit him right in the heart, how fucking much she meant to him. He wasn\u2019t letting her go, wasn\u2019t letting the Corps drag her back down into the nightmare world of an active J\u2014even if he had to fight Silence itself. \u201cI know your secrets, too, Sophie,\u201d he said. \u201cWho were you telepathing earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother J.\u201d A pause. \u201cMy shields, Max, I need to explain them, to assess if there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll fail again.\u201d</p><p>His soul repudiated the idea, but he knew she was right. \u201cWhat did your friend say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Sascha Duncan is supposed to be an excellent shield technician\u2014he recommended I talk to her, see if she can figure out what\u2019s behind the regeneration of my shields.\u201d Lifting herself up a little, she pressed her lips to the tiny scar on his cheek, the one she seemed to love.</p><p>It made his heart smile each time she did that. Even today, now, he felt loved, adored.</p><p>\u201cBut we can discuss all that later,\u201d Sophia murmured. \u201cOpen the envelope.\u201d</p><p>Removing his arm from around her, he drew in the vanilla and lavender scent of her and slit open the paper.</p><p>He\u2019d opened so many envelopes since he began this search, become so used to disappointment that it took him almost a minute to realize what he held in his hand. Letting the other pieces of mail fall to the carpet, he ran his hand over the crisp white paper of the single piece he still held. \u201cSee that?\u201d he said, rubbing his thumb over the emblem on the top left-hand corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sophia bent her head. \u201cIt\u2019s from the Department of Justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBart,\u201d he clarified. \u201cI asked him for a favor.\u201d It could\u2019ve gotten the other man fired, but the prosecutor had asked only the questions he needed to get the answer.</p><p>Sophia took a long breath, let it out. \u201cYou asked him to run your DNA against the central Justice criminal database.\u201d</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t the least surprised that she\u2019d guessed. \u201cIt was a logical step, given our socioeconomic circumstances, the history of the other men in the area at the time.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a step I avoided for a hell of a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d Sophia said, shifting to a kneeling position beside him on the sofa, her fingers stroking through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a cop. You\u2019ve dedicated your life to upholding the law\u2014discovering that your father was a criminal who broke those same laws will be a blow.\u201d Her words were calm, practical. \u201cBut Max\u201d\u2014her tone changed, gentled, her eyes shining\u2014\u201cit will alter nothing about the man you are, the man you\u2019ve made yourself.\u201d</p><p>He slid one arm around her waist, his throat thick. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Her forehead touching his in tender affection, her hands cupping his face. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who taught me that life isn\u2019t predestined. We are who we make ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Her faith in him tore him wide open, reformed him a better man. \u201cOpen it for me.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia took the envelope, able to be strong for her cop, to give him what he needed. Sliding her finger under the flap, she slit it open to remove two pieces of paper. The first was closed around the second\u2014which proved to be an automatically sealed printout with serrated edges which could be pulled apart to reveal what lay within. The first was a handwritten note.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she read out, \u201cas far as the computers are concerned, this scan was never done. I don\u2019t know the results. Neither does the computer tech. We requested that the results be printed automatically sealed. I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d It was signed with Reuben\u2019s name. But below that was another line\u2014\u201cP.S. A man\u2019s father doesn\u2019t make the man. If it did, I\u2019d be a self-serving SOB with three wives and an inability to be faithful to any of them.\u201d Sophia put down the letter, her curiosity a wild thing. \u201cI assume he means three consecutive wives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d At her gasp, his lips curved. \u201cBart\u2019s father founded his own religion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many wives does Bart have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been married to Tasma since they were in law school. Got four brats they love like crazy.\u201d</p><p>Sophia smiled. \u201cSo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She broke the serrated edges but held the letter closed. \u201cYou should see it first.\u201d Passing it over, she waited as he read it, then put it on the coffee table. Nothing happened for the next few seconds . . . until Max gave a shuddering sigh and dropped his head, thrusting his hands through his hair.</p><p>Worry tore through her . . . until he lifted his eyes. Relief shone a beacon of sunlight through his irises. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought,\u201d he said, his voice rough with emotion, \u201cthat there was something wrong with me that my mother couldn\u2019t love me. She could love River, and I think she even loved some of the men she brought home. But not me, never me.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s eyes went to the envelope, her brain making connections out of the experiences of a lifetime spent in Justice. \u201cWho was your father, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name isn\u2019t important,\u201d Max said, and she saw that to him, it truly wasn\u2019t. \u201cBut what he did to her . . . He raped her, was convicted of it, died in a prison fight.\u201d A short, brutal summary. Max shook his head. \u201cThe only thing I don\u2019t understand is why she kept me.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia\u2019s hand clenched on his thigh. Looking up, he saw eyes huge with concern, with empathy. \u201cAh, Sophie.\u201d Pulling her into his lap, he nuzzled his face into the sweet curve of her neck as she wrapped her arms around him. \u201cI\u2019m not in shock.\u201d Part of him, somewhere deep inside, had guessed the truth a long time ago. \u201cNow that I know why she couldn\u2019t love me, I can forgive her for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better person than I am,\u201d Sophia said, her anger a steel flame. \u201cYou were a child.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled, holding her tight, this woman who would fight for him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve become a man.\u201d Looking back, he could feel only pity and sorrow for the tormented, haunted woman who\u2019d been his mother. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a man who is loved. Who loves to the depths of his soul.\u201d</p><p>There was no way in hell he was ever letting anyone take Sophie away from him. She was his. The Justice Corps would have to just fucking get used to that. \u201cBaby,\u201d he said, turning his relentless will to how to ensure no one would ever dare come between him and his J, \u201cwe need a plan.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 45</p><p>Nikita entered the mental vault of the Council chambers knowing that what she was about to do would change the course of Psy history. Whether she\u2019d come out of the change alive, time alone would tell.</p><p>Kaleb entered with her, Ming LeBon coming in just after.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re well?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The militarily inclined Councilor didn\u2019t give much away. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stopped speaking as Henry and Shoshanna Scott entered, followed by Tatiana Rika-Smythe and Anthony Kyriakus in short order.</p><p>\u201cNikita,\u201d Shoshanna Scott said as soon as the psychic doors closed, \u201cis this about the problems you\u2019ve been having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nikita said. \u201cThe specialists I hired were able to track the assassinations to a Pure Psy zealot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t term the members of Pure Psy zealots.\u201d Henry, joining in the conversation.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Nikita had played enough games. \u201cThe dictionary definition of zealotry is \u2018fanatical partisanship.\u2019 I\u2019d say Pure Psy fits the definition.\u201d</p><p>Ming LeBon was the one who spoke next, and his words were nothing Nikita had expected. \u201cI, too, have become concerned about the direction of Pure Psy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seek only to protect our Silence,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThere is nothing of concern in that . . . not unless you wish to protect those who are flawed.\u201d</p><p>Nikita ignored the pointed reference to her daughter, focusing on Ming instead.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Ming continued, \u201cthat goal is now being interlocked with a noticeably racial agenda. Pure Psy has begun to see the other races as \u2018unclean\u2019 for want of a better word. It\u2019s indisputable that Nikita was targeted because she has strong business ties with the changelings.\u201d</p><p>Well, Kaleb\u2019s voice whispered in Nikita\u2019s mind, it seems this will make strange bedfellows out of us all.</p><p>He may have an ulterior motive, Nikita replied. Let us wait and see.</p><p>\u201cKeeping our people apart from the other races,\u201d Henry said, \u201cis not the worst of choices. If we could achieve isolation, our Silence would soon be pristine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that\u201d\u2014Anthony Kyriakus\u2019s cool, considered voice\u2014\u201cthen you\u2019re a fool.\u201d</p><p>Shoshanna\u2019s riposte was quick. \u201cIt\u2019s only the weaker members of our populace who are prone to breaks from conditioning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019ll add two cardinals and a gifted scientist to that list?\u201d Anthony\u2019s question was measured, no less lethal for its absolute calm. \u201cIt\u2019s time we faced up to the facts. Silence is beginning to crumble at far more than just the edges, and if we don\u2019t make a choice on how to handle it, we risk an uncontrollable breakdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely,\u201d Tatiana Rika-Smythe said, entering the conversation for the first time, \u201cit\u2019s not that urgent. Yes, there have been incidents, but nothing to suggest a Net-wide emergency.\u201d</p><p>Ming\u2019s mind swirled an icy razor. \u201cI made note of an incident at the Sunshine mining station several months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mass psychotic outbreak?\u201d Nikita clarified, not having been immediately involved with the situation. According to the data she quickly accessed, the episode had resulted in over a hundred fatalities.</p><p>\u201cYes. It seemed an aberration at the time, but in the past three days, we\u2019ve had another mass incident at a remote science station on the Russian steppes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many dead?\u201d Kaleb, speaking aloud for the first time.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred,\u201d was the response. \u201cAnd of the fifty survivors, at least thirty are candidates for total rehabilitation. Their minds are broken.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence as they digested that. Nikita decided to speak first, draw a line in the sand. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep rehabilitating people. It\u2019s akin to putting your finger in a dyke when the dam has burst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehabilitation is key,\u201d Henry argued. \u201cIt will remove the unstable part of the populace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Nikita asked, holding her own Silence, holding the cold that had been conditioned into her as a child\u2014a cold so deep and true that nothing would ever thaw it. \u201cStopping when all our people are dead seems rather pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA melodramatic statement,\u201d Tatiana responded. \u201cIt\u2019s still a minority who are experiencing problems, and you said yourself that more and more people are getting themselves voluntarily reconditioned, so the situation will correct itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs to that,\u201d Anthony said, \u201cit seems you haven\u2019t been reading your reports, Councilor.\u201d</p><p>Shoshanna spoke into the silence. \u201cAnthony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a marked decline in the number of individuals choosing to have their conditioning checked over the past two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Henry asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been kept updated on all the numbers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEither someone is lying to you,\u201d Nikita said, \u201cor you misinterpreted the data. The fact is, the Net is buzzing with new whispers of dissent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Ghost,\u201d Shoshanna interrupted, referring to the most infamous insurgent in the PsyNet. \u201cHe\u2019s been spreading his brand of rebellion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nikita said, \u201che simply pointed out the truth\u2014that the violence that began the reconditionings was planned, that the populace was being shepherded toward the Center. Even Psy, it seems, do not like being so openly manipulated.\u201d In truth, that had come as an unexpected realization. Nikita had begun to see their people as the herd of sheep they\u2019d been for so long. But the tides were shifting. And Nikita did not intend to drown.</p> <p>There was a moment of silence, and she knew telepathic messages were being exchanged, data scanned as her claims were verified.</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d Henry finally said, \u201ccannot fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Tatiana added, \u201cthe bedrock of our stability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Shoshanna\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThat stability is failing,\u201d Ming said. \u201cThere is no way to halt the momentum now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it may be time,\u201d Anthony murmured, \u201cfor Silence to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Three voices.</p><p>Ming said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a decision we can make in a single day,\u201d Kaleb said, \u201cwherever we stand. But Pure Psy is a problem that needs to be eliminated. Their actions are only muddying the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPure Psy is composed of those who support Silence,\u201d Henry said. \u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting taking them out of the equation, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying they\u2019re under your protection?\u201d Nikita asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd acting under your orders?\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy pause, as Henry realized what his answer would reveal. They all knew, of course, that he\u2019d been the one pulling Quentin Gareth\u2019s strings\u2014at least for the past half year\u2014but for him to admit it was a different matter.</p><p>Shoshanna \u201csaved\u201d her husband. \u201cPure Psy has its own set of principles. That Henry happens to agree with them is no cause to label him a conspirator in their attacks against you, Nikita.\u201d</p><p>So wifely. The low murmur of Kaleb\u2019s telepathic tone was filled with nothing, so empty that Nikita wondered what she was doing allying herself with him. But in a pit full of vipers, he was at least one she partially understood.</p><p>She\u2019s tied her sail to his, Nikita responded. If he falls, so does she.</p><p>Tatiana is with them.</p><p>Nikita agreed. Ming is ambivalent.</p> <p>Anthony will stand with us\u2014he has too many business interests tied up with the other races.</p><p>Nikita didn\u2019t mention the conversations she\u2019d had with Anthony.</p><p>And you, she asked the most dangerous Tk in the Net. What is your true allegiance?</p><p>That, you will have to wait and see.</p><p>\u201cIt seems we are at an impasse.\u201d Anthony\u2019s intelligent voice. \u201cIt would be best,\u201d he said to Henry, \u201cif you made it clear to Pure Psy that their ambitions of a coup d\u2019etat would be better to be swiftly surrendered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd inform any members in my city,\u201d Nikita said, \u201cthat they have until the end of this meeting to leave. Or I\u2019ll eliminate them myself.\u201d She\u2019d killed. Many times. And she\u2019d do so again. Self-interest, she told herself. It had nothing to do with the fact that Pure Psy had tried to target her daughter, her unborn grandchild.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing\u2014Henry?\u201d she said, focusing on the other Councilor. She had a thousand strains of viruses in her head. One of them, she thought, would penetrate his shields. And she\u2019d find it, no matter how long it took. \u201cThe next time you decide one of my people is flawed and order a rehabilitation without my consent, I might not act in so civilized a fashion. In fact, it might be better for your . . . health if you didn\u2019t set foot in my territory again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your pet J?\u201d Tatiana asked, her tone silky smooth. \u201cThere is something severely wrong with her. Her shield is nothing ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs being extraordinary now a crime?\u201d Nikita had survived in the Council far longer than Tatiana. If the younger woman had forgotten that, she\u2019d get a lethal surprise one quiet day, when she thought herself safe. \u201cShe is one of my people\u2014just like every other Psy within my territorial borders.\u201d The implication was clear.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Shoshanna. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting the broken ones now. I suppose blood will tell.\u201d</p><p>Nikita didn\u2019t engage with the Councilor who\u2019d made the fatal decision to stand by Henry. \u201cI\u2019ve said what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>The meeting ended less than a minute later. Nothing seemed to have been resolved, but Nikita knew that was a thinly veiled fantasy.</p><p>The Council had split in two.</p><p>Kaleb had attended the meeting standing on the deck of his Moscow home. Now, he turned to go back inside, to consider his next move\u2014and to return Max Shannon\u2019s call, the message having come in just as the meeting began.</p><p>That was before he saw the package sitting in the center of his desk.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been there when he\u2019d walked out onto the deck.</p><p>Only one group of people had the skill to have breached his internal security without setting off the alarms.</p><p>Picking up a silver letter opener he\u2019d been given by a human business associate, he slit it open. It held a wooden box. That box contained a pristine patch, such as might go on a uniform. The patch bore the image of two snakes in combat\u2014Councilor Ming LeBon\u2019s personal emblem. But piercing the fabric was a small, perfectly formed black arrow.</p><p>The Arrow Squad, it seemed, had decided to terminate their allegiance to Ming.</p><p>Kaleb didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that allegiance had now shifted to him. No, this was a warning and an invitation in one. Removing the Arrow, he placed it on his desk. Then he put the patch back in the box, and teleported with it to an extremely secure location, \u2019porting out almost as soon as he arrived.</p><p>Two Arrows glanced up at once at the slight sound of something settling on the table to their right, a table that existed deep within the Arrow Squad\u2019s Central Command, and was known only to other Arrows. Neither man said a word, but they began working as one to dismantle the box and destroy the patch.</p><p>There would be no evidence for Ming to find, not until it was too late.</p><p>CHAPTER 46</p><p>Dream of me.</p><p>\u2014Handwritten note from Max to Sophia</p><p>Sophia sat across from Nikita, conscious of Max\u2019s restless presence on the other side of the door. Three days had passed since he\u2019d found out about his father, since they\u2019d made their plan, and Max had spent most of those seventy-two hours in different parts of the country, talking face-to-face with parents whose lost daughters were now being found, thanks to the coordinates Kaleb Krychek had ripped from Gerard Bonner\u2019s dying mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone,\u201d he\u2019d said after the information came through.</p><p>Sophia had shaken her head. \u201cYour friends in DarkRiver will watch over me. Go Max, they hold a piece of your heart, each and every one.\u201d And that was okay with her, more than okay. Max remembered those lost girls, would always remember. \u201cGo and tell their families they\u2019re coming home. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had filled with an angry protectiveness even as he nodded, and she\u2019d known he\u2019d heard the echo of the eight-year-old girl she\u2019d once been. As a result, she\u2019d spent the past seventy-two hours with a changeling in her living space\u2014Desiree was smart and funny, Clay quiet, and Vaughn still made every hair on her body rise. It was as well that Faith had come with her mate.</p><p>Sophia\u2019s own mate, her Max, had returned exhausted an hour ago, with the news that while he\u2019d been getting in often painful personal touch with the parents and relatives of the victims, the forensic teams had located each and every girl. \u201cIt\u2019ll take weeks to fully process the scenes, but the remains are in the morgue,\u201d he\u2019d told her. \u201cI\u2019ll go back when the parents have to come in to pick up their girls, but everyone\u2019s holding on to family right now. They don\u2019t need me\u2014you do.\u201d</p><p>So now, dog-tired but determined, he stood outside the door while she sat a dangerously short distance away from a woman who had the ability to kill without remorse, without pity. But Nikita Duncan was also a woman who understood business, understood how to weigh costs against benefits. Sophia met her gaze. \u201cI need a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a J.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJs have very short life spans.\u201d</p><p>Almond-shaped eyes filled with speculation. \u201cI am missing several advisors as you\u2019re aware, but unlike Detective Shannon, you have no skills I can utilize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have contacts across the Net.\u201d Js saw everything. And they talked to each other, because only another J understood the broken pieces within them. \u201cAs the situation with Quentin Gareth proved, you have a critical gap in your organization. I can fill a large part of it, organize a team that will round out the other aspects.\u201d</p><p>Nikita leaned back in her chair. \u201cIs Detective Shannon part of the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sophia held the Councilor\u2019s gaze. \u201cTo be quite blunt, you don\u2019t want him working for you if he doesn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nikita was silent for several minutes. \u201cCan you be discreet about your unorthodox relationship with him?\u201d</p><p>Shock held Sophia silent for several seconds. Scrambling to make sense of the question, she decided to alter the plan and take the biggest gamble of her life, one that could put her back on the rehabilitation watchlist. \u201cYes, in public. However, I plan to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Again, Nikita didn\u2019t react as predicted. \u201cDo it in private, file the legal paperwork through the slowest court system you can find\u2014as a J, you should know precisely which one will fit the definition. Under no circumstance can anything you experience leak out into the Net. If it does, the Arrows will strike.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy shields are impregnable.\u201d Sophia looked at the Councilor, suddenly aware that she had more of a capacity to understand this powerful woman than most. The darkness in her recognized the same in Nikita. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange.\u201d Nikita rose to her feet, walked to the plate-glass wall that looked out over the city. \u201cBut change takes time, and always claims victims.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wouldn\u2019t ever again be a victim. \u201cI will never like you,\u201d she said to the Councilor\u2019s back. \u201cBut I will never lie to you either. I think you could do with an advisor who\u2019s not afraid of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNormal Psy do not feel.\u201d</p><p>Sophia said nothing. Not on that. \u201cI\u2019ve thought and thought about why you might\u2019ve asked for me on this assignment, and I can only come up with one answer.\u201d And it was an answer beyond Silence, an answer to do with mothers and daughters, redemption and forgiveness. \u201cBut I can\u2019t make myself believe it. Not of you.\u201d</p><p>Nikita took five long minutes to respond. \u201cPick up the standard employment contract on your way out. And Ms. Russo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be scared of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Sophia rose. \u201cBut once you\u2019ve seen what I have, once you\u2019ve lived in the abyss for that long, fear becomes nothing but another cage.\u201d Then she walked out and into the arms of a cop who waited only until they\u2019d closed the door to his apartment behind them before crushing her into his arms and taking her mouth in a kiss that demanded.</p><p>She felt the lingering pain in him, the heavy sorrow of all those families, and gave him what he needed. Everything.</p><p>He ripped open her jacket, shoved up her skirt with rough, hungry hands that licked fire across her skin. \u201cStop me, Sophie.\u201d A harsh whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She pushed off his own shirt, baring the sleekly muscular beauty of his chest. \u201cI missed you until I couldn\u2019t breathe. Come inside me.\u201d</p><p>Her panties were torn off her, his fingers urgent as he tested her slickness. Lifting a leg, she wrapped it around his hip. He swore, lowered the zipper on his pants, and then the hot, hard heat of him was thrusting into her, pinning her against the wall. She cried out, holding on, holding him tight.</p><p>The pleasure was a firestorm that erased the pain, wiped away the sorrow, left her limp, his face buried in her neck as that muscular back gleamed with perspiration. \u201cHello, my Max,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cHello, my sweet, sexy Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Later that day, after they\u2019d spent most of it tangled up skin to skin, sleeping and loving and holding each other, Sophia took a deep breath. \u201cI did some in-depth investigation of my new shields while you were away\u2014I think I know their origin.\u201d</p><p>Her cop stroked her hair off her face, his expression intent. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of this is because I\u2019m an anchor, but part of it is because my mind is . . . unique.\u201d It had survived by doing the extraordinary. \u201cYou know about the NetMind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors it\u2019s some kind of psychic entity that organizes the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The thing is, there\u2019s a DarkMind, too.\u201d She\u2019d searched, dug deep to find confirmation of her suspicions. \u201cIt\u2019s made up of all the emotions my race has rejected, and it\u2019s so angry, so scared, and so very, very lonely. I think . . . it\u2019s also a little insane.\u201d</p><p>Max didn\u2019t ask what others might have. He asked only the critical question. \u201cThis DarkMind is protecting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both are in a sense.\u201d She took a shaky breath, swallowed. \u201cAt first I thought my shields were a psychic extension of the Net, that for some reason, the Twin-Minds had decided to look after me, but while that made sense with my Net shields, it didn\u2019t explain my telepathic protections\u2014those have to come from within. Then I realized it\u2019s me.\u201d She hesitated.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetheart.\u201d A kiss on her forehead, arms that held her close. \u201cNo matter what, you\u2019re still my Sophie, still my J.\u201d</p><p>Her heart settled, quiet, content. \u201cI am a living, breathing extension of the Net, Max.\u201d The tendrils snaked through her mind, fine threads, and not the dark alone. The light was there, too, simply less obvious to the casual eye. \u201cI\u2019m not just an anchor any longer\u2014I\u2019ve become some kind of a focus.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, she shared the truth about her shields with Sascha Duncan over a secure comm link. The empath\u2019s face held no rejection, only concern. \u201cBut Sophie, the Net is going mad. If it\u2019s inside you on that level . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s hope, Sascha.\u201d A blinding, beautiful hope. \u201cAs the Net passes through my anchor point, the light and the dark come together if only for a fraction of a second.\u201d</p><p>Comprehension dawned in a fracture of color in Sascha\u2019s cardinal eyes. \u201cAnd for that instant, they\u2019re sane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her throat locked. \u201cI may be the sole anchor who can give them that peace. And that\u2019s not right.\u201d Because outside of the tiny oasis of her mind, the Net was going inexorably mad, a dark rot seeping through its very fabric\u2014parts of the PsyNet were already dead, places where neither the DarkMind nor the NetMind could go.</p><p>Sascha\u2019s own eyes shone wet. \u201cNo, they should\u2019ve never been split in two, but their sentience is formed and shaped by the Net. They can\u2019t, won\u2019t merge until Silence falls.\u201d</p><p>And that, they both knew, might take an eternity . . . and a war that could devastate their world. \u201cThings are changing,\u201d Sophia whispered, holding the empath\u2019s gaze. The NetMind loved Sascha. The DarkMind knew the empath could give them something, but it didn\u2019t know how to shape its request, how to even convey its painful need. \u201cYou\u2019ve felt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A solemn gaze, but it held hope, the determination of a Psy willing to fight for her people. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re safe, Sophia?\u201d So much care, the empath\u2019s huge heart there in the timbre of her voice, in every part of her.</p><p>At that moment, Sophia understood some of what the crippled, voiceless DarkMind was trying to tell her, understood that the Es had to be reawakened if the Net was to survive.</p><p>\u201cI understand why it does what it does,\u201d Sascha continued, sorrow erasing the stars in her eyes, \u201cbut the Dark-Mind\u2019s need for vengeance has pushed it to spawn terrible crimes.\u201d</p><p>Sophia wrapped her arms around Max\u2019s waist, laying her ear against the solid pulse of his heartbeat, the warmth of him her own personal anchor. \u201cIn my mind, they\u2019re one.\u201d They were whole. As she was finally whole.</p><p>\u201cThey balance each other.\u201d Sascha\u2019s voice turned soft, thoughtful. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . I accept the DarkMind,\u201d Sophia said, hiding nothing of who she was, the darkness that had shaped her. \u201cIt has no need to scream, no need to fight to be known, to be remembered.\u201d She would never shut it away, never force it to be Silent.</p><p>Just like her cop had never asked her to be anything but what she was\u2014a flawed, scarred J. Lifting her head, she reached up and pressed a kiss over that scar on his cheek, uncaring of their audience. Thanking him. Adoring him.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered, his arms holding her tight. \u201cI know, baby.\u201d</p><p>It was all she needed to hear.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, Max. Please don\u2019t be mad. I just can\u2019t be here anymore.</p><p>\u2014Handwritten note from River Shannon to Max Shannon</p><p>Sophia had never felt more content than she did at that moment, lying in the loose circle of Max\u2019s arms as they sat in bed watching the entertainment screen. The show wasn\u2019t important\u2014it was background. But the warmth of Max, the scent of him, the knowledge that no one could ever steal this from her now . . . it was an almost vicious happiness.</p><p>Max rubbed his chin on her hair. \u201cI can tell when you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not Psy?\u201d A kiss pressed to the golden-brown skin under her cheek. He was only wearing a pair of boxers, while she\u2019d pulled on a tank top and a pair of pajama bottoms with dancing penguins on them.</p><p>Max\u2019s fingers massaged the back of her neck in an absent caress. \u201cOne hundred percent primitive human.\u201d</p><p>Tapping her fist against the hardness of his bare abdomen, she reached up to press a kiss against his jaw. \u201cI like you primitive.\u201d</p><p>He took her mouth, stole her breath. And when he released her, he said, \u201cI knew you wanted me for my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and your salary.\u201d Smiling, she tumbled him onto the sheets until she straddled him, her elbows braced on either side of his head. \u201cAre you going to take the job Nikita offered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gives me hives to think about working for a Councilor.\u201d He scowled, his hands shaping over her hips. Lower. \u201cBut then I think about all the secrets I could learn, all the other cops I could help with the contacts I\u2019d make, the access I\u2019d have.\u201d</p><p>Sophia shivered at the way he stroked her, decided she\u2019d have to get him in front of a mirror today. The fantasy was driving her to delirium. \u201cI\u2019ve already sold my soul\u201d\u2014that got her a grin, and she had to kiss his dimple then\u2014\u201cso I have little credibility, but Nikita seems to be better than some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot saying much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She ran one hand down over his chest, loving the fact that she could adore him at her leisure, without worry, without fear. As long as nothing leaked out into the Net, no one would come hunting\u2014not in Nikita\u2019s territory. \u201cMax, do you mind that we have to continue to be careful?\u201d Whatever change was happening, it was a slow, secret thing.</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you to total rehabilitation,\u201d he said, his tone somber. \u201cCompared to that, a little discretion is nothing. And\u201d\u2014a Max smile\u2014\u201cyou know it turns me on when you\u2019re all prim and proper in public. I just want to take you home and strip you naked, teach you wicked, wicked things.\u201d Possessive hands shaping her flesh with sensual intent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d She began to slide her hand south. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed, interrupting Max\u2019s groan of anticipation.</p><p>He scowled when she looked up. \u201cIgnore it. It\u2019s probably Nikita\u2019s henchmen come to make sure I\u2019m giving \u2018due consideration\u2019 to her offer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs if you\u2019ll make any decision but the one you want.\u201d She pushed him. \u201cGo answer the door. They won\u2019t go away until you do.\u201d</p><p>A black look on his face, Max got up and pulled on his jeans, the tattoo on his back stunning. And, Sophia thought, it wasn\u2019t only because he\u2019d had her name written on the blade. \u201cI love you, Cop.\u201d</p><p>He turned to nip at her lower lip. \u201cGood \u2019cause you\u2019ve got life with no possibility whatsoever of parole.\u201d Then, barefoot and with sleep-tumbled hair, he walked out. She knew he\u2019d done it on purpose\u2014to irritate any assistants Nikita had sent.</p><p>Getting out herself, she pulled on a thick terrycloth robe and began to brush her hair. \u201cShall we go see who it is?\u201d she asked Morpheus, who was snaking around her ankles.</p><p>As if he understood, he padded over, with her following.</p> <p>Her hand stopped in midstroke when she saw the man in the doorway.</p><p>Max gripped the doorjamb, his knuckles going white. \u201cHow did you get past security?\u201d It was the first question that came out, the last thing he cared about.</p><p>The blond man in the corridor clasped the wrist of one hand with the other. \u201cI told them who I was at the desk, and they said I was on the list. So . . . I . . .\u201d He swallowed. \u201cDid you know? I mean, should I go? I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, Max grabbed his younger brother in a bone-crushing embrace. \u201cYou fucking idiot. If you try to run off this time, I\u2019m dumping your ass in jail.\u201d</p><p>River\u2019s arms locked around him. Max felt dampness against his skin, had to blink his own eyes, swallow the knot in his throat. Raising a hand after a long, long time, he messed up the hair on the back of River\u2019s head. \u201cWhere have you been, kid?\u201d</p><p>River gave a sheepish grin as they drew apart. \u201cGetting my shit together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t do that without disappearing?\u201d</p><p>River dropped his head, shoving his hands into the back pockets of his jeans. It made Max grin, his heart full to overflowing. He knew this man, grown though he might be.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d Sophia\u2019s gentle voice. \u201cAre you going to invite him in or interrogate him on the doorstep?\u201d</p><p>River\u2019s eyes widened as he laid them on Sophia. \u201cWow, Max, what did you tell her to get her to let you in the door?\u201d</p><p>Max cuffed his brother good-naturedly on the ear as River slid in past him and bent to kiss Sophia on the cheek. \u201cHello, are you sure you\u2019re with the right brother?\u201d</p><p>Sophia had never had a younger sibling. But this man with his laughing eyes and bright smile . . . \u201cAre you making me an offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u201d\u2014a whisper\u2014\u201cbut Max always was a little possessive.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s arm came around her waist, heavy, warm, real. \u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p> <p>River looked up at Max as her cop turned to press his lips to Sophia\u2019s temple, and for an instant, Sophia saw the truth of River\u2019s emotions laid bare. So much love, so much need, so much pain. Max\u2019s brother, she thought, needed them. \u201cWelcome home, River.\u201d</p><p>His expression shifted into a wary kind of hope. \u201cYeah?\u201d But he was looking at Max.</p><p>Max reached out to thump a fist on River\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re staying if I have to tie you to the furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d River said, dipping his head but not before Sophia saw the sheen in his eyes, \u201cjust tie me to your Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Sophia said as Max mock-scowled, \u201cI\u2019m going to like having a younger brother.\u201d Reaching out, she slipped her arm into the crook of River\u2019s elbow. \u201cSo, tell me all of Max\u2019s secrets.\u201d</p><p>Max curled his hand around her nape. \u201cHey now, no ganging up on me.\u201d</p><p>River laughed, said something. So did Max, the heat of his hold burning through to warm every part of her as she listened to the joy beneath their words.</p><p>Home.</p><p>Finally, they were all home. </p> </body></html>"]
