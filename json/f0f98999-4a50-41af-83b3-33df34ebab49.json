The violet fabric book of love spells nestled in the grass beside her feet. She glanced around and hoped to God her family didn\u2019t wake. She\u2019d promised her sister-in-law she\u2019d never attempt to cast a spell, but Maggie didn\u2019t need to know. Tucked toward the back of the property, the scents of crackling burnt wood and sweet crocus filled her nostrils, and she prayed the firelight wouldn\u2019t reveal her location.</p> <p>Carina glanced down at the page. Okay, time to summon Earth Mother. She hoped Father Richard wouldn\u2019t get upset. She quickly recited the words to summon the powers of female earth to conjure her a man with all the qualities written on her list.</p><p>Then she threw the paper in the fire.</p><p>Lightness flowed through her and she let out a relieved sigh. Done. Now, all she had to do was be patient. She wondered how long Earth Mother usually waited to bestow her gift. Of course, she\u2019d made the job quite easy for the entity. Instead of a long list of qualities, her list held the power of one single name. The name of the man she\u2019d been in love with her whole life, the man who looked upon her as a little sister, the man who was worldly and sexy and dated some of the most beautiful women in the world, the man who left her tongue-tied during the day and wracked her body with hot-blooded need during the night.</p><p>Maximus Gray.</p><p>Carina waited until the entire paper turned to ash, then dumped the bucket of water onto the fire. She cleaned up with quick, efficient movements, scooped up the fabric book, and made her way back into the house.</p> <p>The soft grass tickled her bare feet, and her white nightgown billowed around her like a ghost. A sense of excitement shivered down her spine as she snuck back to her room. She slid the book back into the drawer and crawled into bed.</p><p>Finally, it was done.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hired a new associate. She\u2019ll be under your direction, and you will be responsible for her training.\u201d</p><p>Max cut his gaze to the man seated across the table. His nerve endings prickled at the announcement, but he remained silent. He stretched out his legs under the conference table, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and quirked a brow. He\u2019d worked endless hours and sweat blood to get the family empire of La Dolce Maggie, the U.S. branch of Italian-based La Dolce Famiglia, off the ground, and damned if he\u2019d step aside nicely. \u201cLooking to replace me, boss?\u201d</p><p>More like a brother than a boss, Michael Conte shot him a grin. \u201cAnd deal with your mama coming after me to kick my ass? No such luck. You need help with the expansion.\u201d</p> <p>Max smirked. \u201cSeems your mama is tougher than mine. Didn\u2019t she instigate a shotgun wedding with your wife? Good thing you loved her, or you would\u2019ve been screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, Gray. The wedding wasn\u2019t the problem. It was your doubts about my wife that truly screwed us up.\u201d</p><p>Max winced. \u201cSorry. Just trying to protect a friend from a money-hungry woman. Anyway, I love Maggie now. She\u2019s strong enough to take your crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, now it\u2019s like a mutual admiration club between you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than war. So, who\u2019s the hotshot coming in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina.\u201d</p><p>Max snapped his mouth shut. \u201cExcuse me? Carina, your baby sister? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me\u2014isn\u2019t she still in school?\u201d</p><p>Michael poured himself some water from the cooler and took a sip. \u201cShe graduated last May with her MBA from SDA Bocconi, and she\u2019s been training at Dolce di Notte.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur competitor?\u201d</p><p>Michael smiled. \u201cHardly. They are not looking to conquer the world like us, my friend. But I can trust them to teach her basic skills in the bakery business. I wanted her to train with Julietta but she refuses to lag in her older sister\u2019s shadow. She\u2019s been begging me to come to America and her internship is up. It is time she now join the family company. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. Yeah, he understood. Max was being reassigned to babysitting duty for the youngest sister of the clan. Sure, he loved her like a sibling, but her tendency to burst into tears over emotional scenes did not go well with business. Max shuddered. What if he hurt her feelings and she crumbled? This was a bad idea all around.</p><p>\u201cUm, Michael, maybe you should put her in accounting. You always said she\u2019s capable with figures, and I don\u2019t think management is a good fit. I\u2019ve got a crazy schedule and I\u2019m in delicate negotiations. Please give her to someone else.\u201d</p><p>His friend shook his head. \u201cEventually, I will move her to CFO. But for now I want her with you. She needs to learn proper management and how La Dolce Maggie works. You\u2019re the only one I trust to make sure she doesn\u2019t get in trouble. You\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>The simple words slammed the last nail into his vampire home. Family. Michael had always taken care of him, and he\u2019d proven himself worthy. He\u2019d also dreamed of a place carved out just for him. The peak of the food chain, so to speak. No one had ever questioned his job as CEO, but lately he wondered if missing the prized Conte blood in his veins hurt his position. Contracts were temporary, and his was renegotiated every three years. He craved a more permanent place in the empire he helped build, and the expansion of three more bakeries could be his crown jewels. If he did his job well, he\u2019d secure himself at the top, right beside Michael\u2014as a permanent partner instead of an appointed CEO. Worrying about a young girl fresh from business school would only distract him. Unless . . .</p><p>He tapped his finger against his lower lip. Perhaps Michael needed to be reminded of how critical his efforts were for the company. By throwing Carina certain challenges, he\u2019d be sure to highlight her deficiencies and young age, all the while keeping her under his so-called protection. After the expansion, Max intended to approach Michael about partnership. Carina may be able to help his cause, especially if he mentored her and she depended on his feedback.</p><p>Yes, perhaps this was for the best.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Michael, if this is what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. She\u2019ll be arriving in about an hour. Why don\u2019t you come to dinner tonight? We\u2019re having a small welcome celebration for her arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Maggie cooking?\u201d</p><p>Michael grinned. \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man.\u201d Michael crushed the paper cup, threw it in the trash, and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Max glanced at his watch. He had a ton of work to accomplish before she arrived.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina stared at the sleek wooden door with the shiny gold sign. She swallowed past the tightness in her throat and swiped her damp palms down her black skirt. This was ridiculous. She was grown up and well past the days of mooning over Max Gray.</p><p>After all, three years was a long time.</p><p>She smoothed back a strand of hair from her sleek topknot, straightened her shoulders, and knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his husky voice drifted past her memory and grabbed her in a choke hold. It was rich and creamy smooth, hinting at naughty sex and mischief that only a nun could ignore. Maybe.</p><p>She opened the door and strode in with fake confidence. Carina knew it didn\u2019t matter. The business world only observed what lay upon the surface. The knowledge soothed her\u2014she had gotten very good at hiding her emotions during her training. It was simply a matter of survival.</p><p>\u201cHello, Max.\u201d</p><p>The man behind the sprawling teak desk gazed at her with a strange mixture of warmth and surprise, almost as if he wasn\u2019t expecting the woman who stood before him. Those piercing blue eyes sharpened and roved over her figure before his face smoothed out to a polite welcome. Her heart teetered, dropped, and held steady. For one moment, she allowed herself to drink in his appearance.</p><p>His body was lean and trim, and his impressive height always added an intimidating demeanor that was an edge with most of his deals. His face reflected the image of a demon and angel caught in a love affair. Sharp cheekbones, an elegant nose, and a graceful curved brow held hints of aristocracy. The sexy goatee hugged his jaw, accented the plump curve to his lips, and bespoke pure sex. Thick, coal black hair fell in untamed waves across his forehead and set off the rocketing blue of his eyes. As he moved toward her, he walked with an easy grace a tall man usually didn\u2019t pull off, and the enticing scent of his cologne teased her senses. The odd combination of wood, spice, and lemon made her want to bury her face in the curve of his neck and breathe in.</p><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t. Not even when he held her briefly in a welcome hug. Her fingers rested over broad shoulders barely contained in his custom-made navy suit. She\u2019d long ago faced her own personal kryptonite and learned core lessons. Acknowledge her weakness. Accept it. Move on. The simple rules in business applied to all areas of her life now.</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long, cara.\u201d Unease flashed in his eyes, then disappeared. \u201cI heard you graduated at the top of your class. Well done.\u201d</p><p>She gave a brief nod. \u201cThank you. And you? Michael says you\u2019re working hard on expanding La Dolce Maggie.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cYes. It seems you will be assisting me in this aspect. Have you spoken with your brother yet?\u201d</p><p>Carina frowned. \u201cNo, I came straight to headquarters so I could put in a few hours first. I figured he\u2019d give me the tour. What division is he starting me with? Accounts payable, budgeting, or operations?\u201d</p><p>He studied her face for a while, his gaze an actual caress as he probed every feature. She held tight and submitted to the inspection. She needed to get used to his presence since she\u2019d be bumping into him at work. Thank God she\u2019d be buried in accounting. Her core concentration and skills with figures were solid, and Max would rarely need to peek in on her progress.</p><p>A smile curved those sensual lips and briefly distracted her. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour division. You\u2019ll be working with me as my assistant. I\u2019ll be training you.\u201d</p><p>Horror flooded her. She took a step back as if he was the demon who requested she sign away her soul. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d A crazy laugh escaped her lips. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to get in the way. I\u2019ll speak with Michael and convince him to start me somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not want to work with me?\u201d He lifted his hands. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Carina. I will take good care of you.\u201d</p><p>An image of him slipping his fingers in her damp heat and stroking her to orgasm blazed before her vision. God knew he\u2019d take care of a woman. In all ways. Color flooded her cheeks so she turned quickly as if studying his office. Ridiculous. She was losing her control within five minutes of their first meeting.</p><p>Her heels clicked on the wooden tile as she paced and feigned interest in the large photo of the waterfront opening. This was her ultimate test, and she refused to fail. Max was a silly crush from her youth, and she\u2019d no longer live her life in an emotional prison. She\u2019d come here for two main reasons: Prove her worth, and exorcise the ghost of Maximus Gray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Failure so far on both accounts.</p><p>She cleared her throat and faced him once again. \u201cI appreciate your willingness to train me,\u201d she said pleasantly, \u201cbut I\u2019d feel more comfortable elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>His lip quirked. \u201cSuit yourself. But I think your brother has a clear idea of what he wants. Why don\u2019t I give you a brief tour while I ring him? I don\u2019t think he expected you until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She lifted her chin in challenge. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time to remind my brother he is no longer in charge of me.\u201d</p> <p>Carina made sure to lead the way out.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>Max trotted obediently after the cool, poised woman in front of him and tried to gather his wits. This was not the young girl he\u2019d last seen in Italy, who was emotional, dramatic\u2014self-conscious.</p><p>No, this Carina Conte had grown up. He used to get a kick out of her admiring gaze and shy habit of ducking her head when something embarrassed her. Carina was used to listening to the demands of others. She was a people pleaser, extra sensitive, and a lovely girl he\u2019d always felt quite overprotective about. But the woman he\u2019d met this time seemed completely in control and capable. The idea of her standing up to her older brother shocked him. He wondered at the quick stab of disappointment in the changes, then shrugged it off. Maybe she\u2019d end up being more of an asset to the company than he\u2019d originally thought.</p> <p>Of course, her body had bloomed, too. Or had he just never noticed? Max ripped his gaze away from the full curve of her rear as she swung her hips in the ancient rhythm created to drive men mad. Shorter than her older sisters, she teetered on four-inch heels that showed off the muscled length of her legs. As he introduced her to various employees and they made their way around the ground floor, he noticed that she\u2019d grown in other ways, also. Especially in her cleavage.</p><p>Heat rushed through him and squeezed. The delicate white blouse opened at the neck and revealed a touch of lace. Her full breasts strained against the material as if dying to escape, turning her respectable business suit into a vehicle for a stripper. Horrified at the sudden veer of his thoughts, he quickly imagined nuns in underwear and got himself back in control.</p><p>Carina was off-limits. He was her guardian and second protector. Max shook his head and studied her face in an almost academic light. She\u2019d always been a pretty girl, but usually slapped on so much makeup he couldn\u2019t really see her features. Today, scarlet red lips were her only accessory. The olive tint to her skin gleamed under the light and tempted a man to touch. Those untamed curls had disappeared into a severe topknot that set off heavy brows and high cheekbones. Her nose was all Italian, and dominated her face, but the power of those stormy dark eyes held a person captive and refused to let go. She\u2019d never be rail thin, and he wondered why most women wanted to be. The lush curves that strained against her straight-edged suit was all temptress.</p><p>Did she have a lover?</p><p>Crap, where did that thought come from? He rubbed his eyes and half groaned with relief at the sight of Michael down the hallway.</p><p>Her brother threw his arms out in the ancient family tradition, but Carina didn\u2019t rush into his embrace. Instead, she smiled, walked slowly down the hall, and hugged him back. The strength of their bond shimmered around them, and once again Max experienced a pang of loneliness. He always craved a sibling to share his life with. At least, Michael and his sisters were his adopted family. But after Max\u2019s father took off, only one goal remained and kept him on the path to revenge: success.</p> <p>So don\u2019t screw it up.</p><p>He nodded to the inner voice and refocused. Michael flung his arm around Carina\u2019s shoulder and walked over. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you are finally here, mia bella. I told my driver to take you directly to the house, though. Maggie has been waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Carina tilted her head up and grinned. \u201cAnd how is my sister-in-law doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame her?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI told your driver there was a change in plans. I figured I\u2019d grab a tour, set up my desk, and head to your house. Max gave me a brief overview of the layout.\u201d</p><p>Michael clapped him on the back and turned to Carina. \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands. Why don\u2019t you take the office next to his? It\u2019s been empty for a while, and I can get the boxes cleared out today. We\u2019ll hold a strategy meeting tomorrow on some new developments.\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable silence settled around them. Michael looked confused at the sight of his sister\u2019s stony expression. \u201cYes, it seems we need to lay out some ground rules first. Can we meet in your office?\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two and catch up tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Max. I\u2019d like you to join us,\u201d Carina said.</p><p>Her direct gaze caused an odd sensation to prickle his skin, but he ignored it. He assented and they convened in Michael\u2019s office. The chairs were deep and comfortable, made for long hours of conferences. He fought a chuckle when her petite frame got swallowed by the plush velvet, and she inched her rear to the edge of the seat. She tossed him a disgusted glance that told him his amusement had been caught, and primly closed her legs, heels placed firmly on the floor. Those well-defined calves were made for gripping a man\u2019s hips as he thrust inside her.</p><p>Jesus, get a grip. He was an old man at thirty-four. Sure, the hot librarian look was a shock, but Carina was still like family and years younger. Sheltered. Innocent. She\u2019d probably die of embarrassment if she suspected her appearance rocked his world . . . and parts of his anatomy.</p><p>He quickly dispersed the image.</p><p>\u201cMichael, I have some concerns about my place here. Maybe you can let me know what you see as my role, and we can make the necessary adjustments.\u201d</p><p>Her brother drew back. Seems like he wasn\u2019t the only one surprised by the rational Carina Conte. \u201cYou should not worry about this, cara. Eventually, you will take the position of CFO, but for now you will assist Max in all aspects of running La Dolce Maggie. I need you to learn all levels of the operation first. Of course, you will live with Maggie and me. I\u2019ve set up a private suite, and you may decorate it any way you\u2019d like. When you have concerns, come to me and we will work them out.\u201d Michael practically beamed with pride at his generous offer.</p><p>Somehow, Max suspected trouble brewing. Big trouble. He waited for the feminine temper explosion.</p><p>Carina nodded. \u201cI see. Well, that is quite generous of you and I appreciate the offer. Unfortunately, I did not come to New York to live in my brother\u2019s house and shadow his CEO. I have my own plans. I\u2019m moving into Alexa\u2019s old loft apartment this weekend. As for La Dolce Maggie, I think I\u2019ll serve the company better in accounting and operations since that will be my permanent position. Max does not need someone distracting him from his role here.\u201d</p><p>Max quickly snapped his mouth closed and prayed no one noticed. Where were the fireworks and family drama? Carina was a passionate, emotional young woman who never held her tongue and followed every feeling she ever had. That was why she got into so much trouble. He remembered the time she jumped out of the car to follow a stray dog into the woods and got lost. Dio, what a fiasco. They thought she\u2019d been kidnapped, and had found her hours later with a filthy ball of fur in her arms in a makeshift shelter she\u2019d constructed out of twigs and leaves. Not even a tear in sight, she\u2019d announced her confidence in being found and walked out with that dog while her brother screamed and Max nearly passed out with relief.</p><p>Michael stared at her. \u201cAbsolutely not. You are my sister and will stay with us. New York is a scary place. As for the company, I do not need another person in the accounting department at the moment. You will learn more from Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled pleasantly, but her word shot through the room like a balloon pop.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not listening to me, Michael. If we can\u2019t communicate in an adult manner, it\u2019s not going to work out. I\u2019ve already received two job offers from businesses in Manhattan, and I haven\u2019t given them my final decision. I want to prove my worth here, but if you continue to treat me like a little sister, I won\u2019t be able to do my job properly. This would not be fair to anyone. Now, if you have a valid reason other than wanting Max to keep an eye on me and out of trouble, I\u2019d like to hear it. If not, I will happily move onward with no hurt feelings. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>Max prepped for the Italian temper of his friend and boss. There was one thing Michael pursued with the vigor of medieval warfare\u2014the protection of his baby sister. His word meant law in the Conte household, passed from generations of old-school traditions. The idea of Carina suddenly challenging his decisions the moment she landed on his turf fascinated the hell out of him.</p><p>And then the world tilted on its axis.</p><p>Michael gave a brief nod. A hint of a smile touched his lips. \u201cVery well, cara. I want you to stay in my home because Maggie will enjoy your company. We can show you around until you become more comfortable in your surroundings. As for the company, I know your skills excel with figures but I need you to get training in all aspects of the business, most especially management. Max is the only one I trust to properly hone your skills.\u201d</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Max looked around for the cameras but found none. Carina looked pleased. \u201cVery well, I agree that Max will be the best person. I\u2019ve missed Maggie, too, so I\u2019ll stay for the whole week. But then I really need to move\u2014living with my older brother is not what I expected when I came out here. It\u2019s time I get my own place, and Alexa\u2019s loft sounds perfect. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy about losing the last half of the agreement, and Max waited for more negotiations.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>The siblings grinned at each other. Who were these people?</p><p>\u201cNow, let me visit the restroom, then would you take me home? I\u2019m exhausted and need to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We are having a small dinner party to celebrate your arrival, but you\u2019ll have a chance to nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d She gracefully rose from the chair and stopped in front of him. \u201cThank you for the tour, Max. I will see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still dumbstruck at the civil meeting he\u2019d just witnessed. She left the room and he stared at his boss. \u201cWhat the hell was that about? Why aren\u2019t you laying down the law like you always do? And what happened to her? She hasn\u2019t cried or gotten upset once since she\u2019s arrived.\u201d</p><p>Michael waved his hand in the air and shrugged on his suit jacket. \u201cMaggie convinced me she needs to be respected as an individual in order to make her own decisions. Do I hate it? Si. But she\u2019s grown up now, and needs to find her own way.\u201d His eyes shadowed. \u201cI am her brother, not her papa. But I appreciate you keeping an eye on her, mio amico. I trust you to keep her safe and help her learn what she needs in order to run this company.\u201d</p><p>Unease slithered down his spine. \u201cRun the company?\u201d</p><p>Michael laughed. \u201cOf course. She is a Conte and will one day take the full reins of La Dolce Maggie. That is what we are training her for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max stared up at his friend, and coldness seeped into his chest. Would he ever truly feel like family and good enough to own a portion of the business? Was he being selfish or ungrateful? They\u2019d built La Dolce Maggie together, but in his gut, Max knew he was replaceable. Carina may be appointed CFO, but would also own a portion of the company. He never demanded permanence from Michael, afraid their friendship would cloud a decision that should be strictly business. Why did he always feel the need to fight harder to truly belong? Sure, his asshole father took off, but the constant struggle of worthiness was getting weary.</p><p>\u201cI shall see you at seven tonight. Thanks, Max.\u201d</p><p>The door shut behind him.</p><p>Max was left in the room with silence. With memories. And with a sick feeling in his gut that never seemed to go away.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Carina sat cross-legged on the bed and giggled as her sister-in-law waddled over and carefully slid into the chair. Her swollen bare feet poked out from the floor-length skirt, and her massive belly rose up and dominated her body. Cinnamon-colored hair slid into her eyes, and Maggie stuck out her lower lip and blew. Immediately the strands parted to reveal a pair of stunning green eyes, now filled with irritation and general discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYour brother sucks,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do now?\u201d Carina asked, trying to look serious at the current condition of her usually trendy, composed sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cPick from the list. He sleeps and has the gall to snore while I lie like a beached whale in the bed. He acts ridiculous by continuously asking me if I need anything. And today he informed me I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to my next photo shoot, something about it getting too dangerous for me to travel.\u201d</p> <p>Carina gulped back a snort of laughter. Maggie was due in eight weeks and still refused to believe she couldn\u2019t follow her normal schedule. \u201cWell, you know how overprotective Michael is,\u201d she offered. \u201cAnd, umm, I don\u2019t know how you\u2019d even be able to kneel down to get the shot, Mags.\u201d</p><p>Maggie glowered. \u201cI know. Why didn\u2019t you tell me twins run in your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that have made a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Oh, God, I don\u2019t know. Probably not. Men suck.\u201d</p><p>Carina was saved from answering that remark by the opening of a door. A face peeked in surrounded by a bunch of corkscrew black curls. \u201cOh, yay, I was hoping you\u2019d be up here. Carina!\u201d</p><p>Carina screeched in joy and they hugged and kissed. Maggie\u2019s best friend, Alexa, was married to Maggie\u2019s brother, and reminded Carina of an older sister. Filled with general enthusiasm and joy, she was part of the core family that made her feel like she belonged. As Carina released her, something jumped under her hands, and she drew back.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God. The baby moved!\u201d</p><p>Alexa put her hands over her swollen belly and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m gonna enroll this one in karate.\u201d With a matching waddle, she air-kissed Maggie and took a seat in the second chair. \u201cThanks God you\u2019re up here. I need some serious girl time. My husband is pissing me off.\u201d</p><p>Maggie snickered. \u201cSeems to be the consensus. What is my dear brother doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me I\u2019m not allowed to go into the bookstore anymore. Like I\u2019m going to let my business slip because I\u2019m pregnant. He keeps reminding me we don\u2019t need the money.\u201d Alexa snorted. \u201cDo you know how many animals we can save with that kind of money? And he\u2019s all cavalier about it, saying I should just stay home and relax. Relax with a three-year-old? Yeah, sure, let me put my feet up and eat bonbons all day. Ain\u2019t gonna happen. At least BookCrazy is quiet and I get to talk to adults.\u201d</p><p>Maggie shuddered. \u201cLast time I came over, Lily locked me in the nursery and made me play tea party for hours. I was fine the first hour, but come on. How long can you drink pretend tea and eat pretend cookies?\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed. \u201cYou guys are killing me. Whatever happened to the happily-ever-after? The romance after marriage? The perfect relationship?\u201d</p><p>The two friends shared a look. \u201cGet over it,\u201d Maggie advised. \u201cReal life is messy.\u201d</p><p>Alexa nodded. \u201cYou want a man who sticks\u2014through the good stuff and the crap. \u2019Cause there\u2019s a lot of crap.\u201d</p> <p>Carina studied them, all belly and discomfort and pissed-off female hormones. \u201cUm, is it worth it?\u201d</p><p>Maggie sighed. \u201cYeah,\u201d she admitted grudgingly. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>Alexa beamed. \u201cDefinitely worth it. Now let\u2019s talk about you. Any yummy stuff to share? Did you decide to take me up on my offer and move into my old apartment?\u201d</p><p>Excitement shimmered up and down Carina\u2019s spine. \u201cYes. It sounds perfect. I\u2019ll move in in about two weeks. Keep Maggie from killing my brother for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, sis.\u201d</p><p>Carina grinned. \u201cWelcome. I stopped at the La Dolce Maggie office and got a tour. Max is going to show me the ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax is the sweetest man. So charming and helpful,\u201d Alexa said.</p><p>Maggie shot her a concerned look. \u201cIs that a good idea, Carina? Do you think you can work closely with Max?\u201d</p><p>Bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>Carina remembered three years ago when Maggie confronted her about Carina\u2019s major crush on Max. Eight years older, and way out of her league, Max caused sleepless nights and crying jags over the proper way to finally get him to notice her. Maggie lectured her on living her own life on her terms first. But love was stubborn. No, it had taken that one unforgettable night to realize Max would never see her as anything more than his friend\u2019s little sister. The memory of her humiliation shimmered before her, but Carina needed the jolt to go and find her own life.</p><p>She took a deep breath and faced her sister-in-law. \u201cYes,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m fine working with Max.\u201d</p><p>Maggie studied her face, then nodded. \u201cGot it. Well, most of the crowd is probably waiting.\u201d She braced herself against the arms of the chair and rocked herself forward. \u201cCome join us when you\u2019re done getting ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be down in a few.\u201d</p><p>Carina lay back on the stuffed pillows and stared at the ceiling. Her entire life revolved around fighting for her place within the family among her gorgeous sisters and talented brother. It seemed everyone had a special niche, except her. Raw anticipation flowed through her blood at the thought of a fresh slate. Another country. A new job. A place to live on her own. The possibilities were endless, stretched before her like a gift, and she was tired of wasting those minutes on a man who\u2019d never love her.</p><p>Marriage and settling down with one man was no longer her goal.</p><p>A hot-blooded, no-holds-barred affair definitely was.</p><p>Her skin tingled. Finally, she was freed from restrictions and intended to explore all of her sexuality. She\u2019d find a man worthy of her and dive headfirst into a physical relationship with no hope of long-term commitment.</p><p>Bad girl.</p><p>Yeah. About time.</p><p>The thought cheered her up. She rolled from the bed, grabbed the red dress off the hanger, and went to change.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Max was enjoying himself. He often ate dinner with Michael and Maggie, and many times they were joined by Alexa and Nick. Comfortable hours filled with laughter and wine and relaxing reminded him of the endless evenings he spent with the Conte family in Bergamo. Mama Conte and his mother had grown up together and were friends as young girls, so when his father took off, Mama Conte adopted him and his mother into her own family. He always felt like a cousin rather than a good friend.</p><p>An itch crept up his spine. Oddly, he had more money than Michael but never wanted a penny of it\u2014not unless it was earned by his own blood and sweat. Like a business transaction, his rich Swiss father swooped in and seduced the local Italian girl. They married quickly, and when the baby arrived, he deposited a nice fat check in her bank account. Then left for good. Max had never met his father, but his money garnered interest over the years. With no extended relatives, his mother needed the funds to survive, but Max choked on it and couldn\u2019t wait to earn his own way. He didn\u2019t want anything from a man who laid eyes on his newborn son and left without a glance back. A man who humiliated his mother in an old-fashioned Catholic town and forced them to wear the stain of abandonment and divorce.</p><p>No, Max didn\u2019t care. He just swore to never bring shame on his mother or ever run away from responsibility. The sins of the father would not carry to the son.</p><p>He\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>Max freshened up his glass of Chianti, grabbed a piece of bruschetta, and turned.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>She came down the elaborate stairway with nonchalant grace, an easy smile, and a killer body wrapped up in fiery red. He\u2019d never seen her in red before, let alone a dress. He\u2019d only seen her in baggy clothes and T-shirts, her natural curves always hidden from view.</p><p>Not anymore. The scoop neck emphasized the lushness of her breasts and the curve of her hips. Her dark curly hair fell around her shoulders and down her back, begging for a man\u2019s fingers to thrust deep and disappear. Her lips were painted scarlet red, setting off the inky depth of her eyes.</p><p>She stopped in front of him, and the words of greeting died in his throat. He was so used to her looks of open longing. He realized she had a tiny crush on him years back. He\u2019d always thought it cute, and quite flattering. Now, he held a sinking feeling she\u2019d come into her own magical powers. Max had taken her flattering words, protectiveness, and admiring gaze for granted. Now, she treated him the same as the others. A sinking disappointment grabbed at his chest, but he firmly shook it off.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. Halfway embarrassed by the lame word, he reminded himself she was like his sister and that his last girlfriend had been actual royalty. \u201cCan I get you some wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Chianti?\u201d She pointed to his glass, and one curl slipped over her forehead and into her eye. The clean scent of cucumber rose to his nostrils, somehow more intoxicating than fake perfumes.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>He busied himself with getting her a glass and held it out.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers brushed his as she took the glass, and he swore he almost jerked back. The tiny buzz was subtle but still present. Exactly what he didn\u2019t need. He shook his head hard and refocused.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you have any questions about the area. I\u2019d be happy to show you around.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her wine and half closed her eyes in pleasure. \u201cHmm, there\u2019s one thing I need above all else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gym. Can you recommend one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael installed a full facility at the company. I\u2019ll show you tomorrow. I usually work out in the early morning if you ever want to join me.\u201d Her gaze flicked over his body as if assessing his muscle structure. He grinned. \u201cWant me to flex?\u201d</p><p>The old Carina would have blushed. This one pursed her lips and pondered. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d He raised a brow. \u201cYou always hated working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill do. But I love to eat, and I have a weight problem. Exercising balances both.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max frowned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a weight problem.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cTrust me, when most clothes are made for tall, leggy women with no hips, you have a weight problem.\u201d</p><p>Irritation prickled his nerve endings. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. You have an actual ass and breasts. That\u2019s the kind of weight a man looks for.\u201d</p><p>He almost gasped when the words came out of his mouth. Conversations with Carina never included body parts, and heat actually tinged his cheeks. What the hell was he doing?</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t look embarrassed. In fact, she laughed out loud and clicked her glass with his. \u201cWell said, Max. But I still may take you up on that offer. How\u2019s Rocky?\u201d</p><p>A faint smile curved his lips. \u201cGreat. He\u2019s completely healed and turned into a lapdog. Kind of embarrassing. I\u2019ve never met a pit bull who\u2019s disinterested in any stranger unless they rubbed his belly.\u201d</p><p>Her almond-shaped eyes softened. Her family deemed Carina \u201cthe animal whisperer\u201d for her ability to communicate with any animal. After he rescued Rocky from the fighting pit, the first call he made was to Carina. She told him exactly how to handle and treat the abused pit bull, and they had worked as a long-distance team to heal his battered soul. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to finally meet him in person,\u201d she said. \u201cPhotos aren\u2019t the same.\u201d</p><p>The image of Carina in his home and with his dog settled over him. It was odd how much he looked forward to seeing her on his own turf. He usually hated bringing women to his house and tried to avoid the trap by going to theirs. Carina took a sip of her wine and startled him with a bold question.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your love life? Who\u2019s the flavor of the month?\u201d</p> <p>He shifted his feet. \u201cNo one special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you turn thirty a while ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to with anything?\u201d he asked. He hated the defensiveness to his tone. \u201cI\u2019m only thirty-four.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJust wondered if you had interest in settling down, having a family. Like them.\u201d</p><p>The two couples stood close together, deep in conversation. Nick\u2019s hand rested on the side of Alexa\u2019s belly, and Michael bent his head to whisper something in his wife\u2019s ear. The air of close intimacy and joy shimmered around the tight circle and left Max with a hole in his gut. Sure, he wanted that. Who wouldn\u2019t? But no woman had made him want to give up his freedom and commit to her forever. He swore he\u2019d be single for life unless he was absolutely one hundred percent sure. He\u2019d never walk away from his wife and family like his father. He\u2019d never abandon someone who needed him. Therefore, he didn\u2019t have the luxury of making any errors within his relationships. The moment a woman wanted to stay in his bed for too long, or invited him to family functions, he took a long hard look at the relationship. If there wasn\u2019t enough feeling, he moved on.</p><p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d been moving on for years now with no permanent relationship in his past.</p> <p>\u201cOne day,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I meet the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mama is getting nervous,\u201d she teased. \u201cI think she\u2019s starting to say extra rosaries with Father Richard, praying that you\u2019re not gay.\u201d</p><p>He choked on the sip of wine. Who was this woman? Her mischievous expression made him want to challenge her. \u201cOh, is that so? And do you think I\u2019m gay?\u201d</p><p>His muscles tightened under her hot gaze as she took in every inch of his body. \u201cHmm, I always did wonder. You dress quite nicely. You know your designer brands. And you\u2019re a bit too pretty for my taste.\u201d</p><p>The breath whooshed out of his lungs. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense. I prefer the bad-boy type. Casual, longer hair, maybe a motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother would kill you, and I bet you never rode on any damn bike.\u201d Temper snapped at him, made even more ridiculous because he knew she was teasing him. \u201cAnd you know I\u2019m not gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She lifted her shoulders as if he now bored her. \u201cThink what you like.\u201d</p> <p>Her evasive answer pissed him off. Had she been on a bike with some guy looking to take advantage? And why did he care? She was a grown woman, for God\u2019s sake, and no longer his concern. She could date whomever she wanted. The image of her clutching some guy around the waist hit him full force. Thighs tight around the hum of the engine. Dark hair flying in the wind. The dip and speed as she hung on tight with the promise of a very different ride afterward.</p><p>Maybe it was time Carina Conte realized he wasn\u2019t a man who took well to teasing.</p><p>He lowered his head. Her eyes widened in surprise as he dipped his mouth close to hers; close enough to see the gorgeous peach sheen to her skin, the ruby red of her lips, and the tiny gasp of breath she emitted in a warm rush. \u201cWant me to prove I\u2019m not gay?\u201d</p><p>She paused just a moment, then rallied. \u201cI never knew my opinion really mattered.\u201d</p><p>The words hit with deliberate precision. Her sharp intellect hidden under a veneer of sweetness always fascinated him. Rarely did she have the courage to spar, and he found himself enjoying this new woman before him. \u201cMaybe things have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched his lips. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time I give you a message for my mother. A type of proof.\u201d</p><p>The pulse beat madly at the base of her neck. Still, her tone was cool and under control when she spoke. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t like to be used.\u201d She took a step back and dismissed him. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve moved on, Maximus Gray. I\u2019m no longer your sweet little pup begging for a bone. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>She walked away with her head held high and joined her brother. Max watched and wondered what the hell he\u2019d started. Was he nuts? Any type of sensual challenge was off-limits\u2014but she\u2019d pushed him. The undercurrents of their conversation cut deep. Had he treated her like that? Guilt assuaged him at the thought of being condescending to someone he loved. And he did love her. Like a sister.</p><p>Max shook his head and went to get some air. He needed to get a grip. No more sparring. No more teasing. They needed to cultivate a business relationship while he taught her the rules of the game and hoped she didn\u2019t surpass him in the skills needed to take over his job. The situation was sticky enough without another complication\u2014especially a sexual attraction.</p><p>He breathed in the clean, crisp air and settled himself. This was just a temporary setback brought on by curiosity.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be repeated.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Stupid. She\u2019d been so stupid.</p><p>Carina watched him from under her lashes as he snapped orders over the phone to one of their suppliers. Last night had been a big mistake. Challenging him on any sexual level was off-limits, but she hadn\u2019t been able to help herself. For the first time, she met him on equal footing, and the heady feeling was too much to contain.</p><p>Until he leaned forward, his mouth inches from her own. The sexy plumpness of his lower lip, the rough stubble hugging his chin and jaw, the drugging heat of those baby blues. Even dressed in jeans, a button-down white shirt, and casual charcoal sports jacket, he reminded her of James Bond on vacation. Not just any Bond. No, he was all Pierce Brosnan, with his smooth good looks, rakish black hair, and hard-muscled body. She bet he\u2019d jump buildings and kill the bad guys without breaking a sweat. His slight accent curled each syllable just a hint to elicit an almost mesmerizing reaction from any female in the room.</p><p>She\u2019d almost swooned like a Victorian heroine. Instead, she fought the sensual haze with a survivor\u2019s instinct and managed to come out on top. Too bad the victory was short-lived. The ache between her thighs and the tightness of her nipples told her she\u2019d never be fully over Max. Her body sang and wept in his presence. But she\u2019d had years of practice, and it was something she\u2019d have to live with.</p><p>Their odd conversation held too many hidden levels that she didn\u2019t want to face. At least they both focused on business this morning. They\u2019d been polite, composed, and ready to work\u2014exactly what she needed.</p><p>He clicked off the phone and unfurled more than six feet of coiled muscle. \u201cWalk with me. We have a meeting with sales.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her briefcase and took off after him, using two steps for every one of his. The headquarters for La Dolce Maggie were now separate from La Dolce Famiglia, which her sister Julietta ran in Italy. When Michael decided to expand the bakery business throughout New York, he\u2019d taken on an ambitious plan to reveal a new opening every quarter. Each location was chosen based on a number of statistics, and Carina agreed with their decisions after reading the reports. Of course, dealing with various chefs, suppliers, and contractors was overwhelming, and Max seemed to be involved in every level.</p><p>Three men sat around the gleaming table of polished wood. Dressed in suits and ties, they gave off the impression of sharpness and polish. They stood as they entered and nodded in welcome.</p><p>\u201cCarina, this is Edward, Tom, and David. They\u2019re our top regional managers, and we\u2019re meeting to see how to increase sales in each region. Carina is my new assistant in training.\u201d They greeted her warmly, and everyone sat down. Max immediately delved into a detailed discussion regarding quotas, outreach, and a variety of other methods she\u2019d learned in school. She scribbled furiously in her notepad and took stock of their responses to Max\u2019s suggestions.</p><p>Edward spoke up. \u201cThe main problem we\u2019re having is separating ourselves from the normal competition. Panera is still huge. Other mom and pop stores in the area focus on bread. Of course, we have the supermarkets for the cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocal is key,\u201d Max said. \u201cNew Paltz may be a college community, but there\u2019s an eclectic mix of new and old world. We\u2019re buying up advertising in every local newspaper and magazine. We\u2019ve used local community contractors and suppliers, so we need to find fresh ways of keeping the connection strong. We\u2019re not looking to compete with the coffee shops or supermarkets. We want business functions, weddings, big parties. We push all fresh ingredients, variety, creativity. An artistic-type bakery will appeal. That\u2019s our focus.\u201d</p><p>Carina cleared her throat. \u201cExcuse me, Max. Have you focused on events coming in spring? Fairs, tastings, outdoor markets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a variety of places we can book booths, but we didn\u2019t know if it would be worth it,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d Max said. \u201cSet it up. Very good, Carina.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to beam from the praise.</p><p>\u201cThe Farmers Craft Festival is two weeks from Saturday. It\u2019s a little late, but if we have some taste samples and advertising, we may be able to squeeze it in,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cDo it. Find someone to man the booth. Remember to keep the menu a secret, though. We want to build surprise of what we\u2019re offering so no one tries to copycat. Research shows more sales and word of mouth is gained by unveiling at the last moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>They spoke a bit more and Max pulled back his chair. \u201cTom and Dave\u2014can I speak with you a moment?\u201d</p><p>Carina gathered up her materials and Edward stopped beside her. \u201cGreat suggestion. Nice to meet you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled and put out her hand. \u201cThank you.

From Italy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBergamo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped there years ago. It\u2019s a gorgeous town.\u201d His gaze was full of appreciation, and a tingle of warmth chased down her spine. He wore his hair longer than most, almost like her brother, and chestnut eyes held a hint of gold, giving him a mysterious look. He was only a few inches taller than her, but his body was solid under a pressed black suit. \u201cLet me know if you need anyone to show you around. I\u2019d be honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, I just may take you up on the offer.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward.\u201d His name cut through the air sharply. \u201cI need you here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, boss.\u201d He gave her a wink and left. Carina held back a satisfied smirk. Not bad. Her first full day on the job, and she had a possible date. There was nothing like a little male appreciation to help a woman focus on her new life.</p><p>She filed her papers neatly in her briefcase and headed for the door.</p><p>Max stood in front of her, arms crossed, blocking the exit. Irritation pulsed from him in waves.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get involved with the employees, Carina. We don\u2019t like to mix business with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cExcuse me? I had a nice conversation. He offered to show me around. Lighten up.\u201d</p> <p>A muscle worked in his jaw. His disapproving stare set her off. Would he ever get over his instinct to protect her like some baby? \u201cEdward is well known for his womanizing ways,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>Humor and horror mingled. She settled on sarcasm and flung her hands out. \u201cOh, thank God you told me! Dating a man who likes to wine and dine women is a horrible fate. At least I know if I go out with him it will only be for a short affair.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you he\u2019s not your type.\u201d</p><p>Carina glowered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my type anymore, Max,\u201d she drawled. \u201cAnd you never will. But thanks for the tip.\u201d She pushed past him. \u201cI\u2019m taking a quick break for lunch.\u201d</p><p>He grasped her upper arm. Heat burned through her jacket and set off her temper. Damn him for pushing her like this. She was sick to death of being coddled by every man in her life. Perhaps it was time to prove her own independence in the most basic way possible. Her tone turned frosty. \u201cIs there something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are different here.\u201d He frowned as if about to give her the sex talk. \u201cThey may want certain things the men you dated back home didn\u2019t badger you for.\u201d</p><p>Oh, boy, this could be fun. She scrunched up her face as if confused. \u201cYou mean sex?\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened. \u201cYes, sex. I don\u2019t want to see you put in an uncomfortable position.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see. I\u2019m glad you pointed that out. So if we go out to dinner they may want to\u2014fool around?\u201d</p><p>Actual red stained his cheeks and she smothered a hoot. \u201cThat\u2019s right. American men may be used to a woman sleeping with them right away, and may not understand your background.\u201d</p><p>Carina burned with humiliation, but the payoff would be worth this conversation. \u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t go to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with Edward. Maybe you can meet some nice men at church on Sunday? They may have one of those singles groups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that won\u2019t be necessary, but thank you. Now that you\u2019ve cleared things up, I know exactly what to do.\u201d</p><p>His hold slipped away, and he took a step back. Relief carved out his features. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want to see you hurt or misled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. You see, besides learning the family company, I came to America for one reason.\u201d She gave him a dazzling smile. \u201cI came to have an affair. On my own terms. I\u2019m not looking to get married or settle down, and in Bergamo if you sleep with someone you have to get married. You know how restricting that is. Isn\u2019t that one of the reasons you left to work with Michael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ll have my own apartment, my own lifestyle, and I can finally engage in some hot, smoking, no-commitment sex. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d She patted his arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to take Eddie up on his offer to show me around. He\u2019s quite my type.\u201d</p><p>Carina left him standing in the doorway with his mouth hanging open and never looked back. She greeted employees along the way as she walked to the lunchroom and grabbed her turkey on rye. Was it so wrong to want to have her own intimate experiences without someone looking over her shoulder? She\u2019d had dates at university, but her mama and Julietta kept a close eye. When she hit the big drinking parties, she always ran into a friend of a friend who knew her family. The reputation of La Dolce Famiglia and her big brother\u2019s long reach strangled her all the way to Milan and back.</p><p>Deep down, she was a bad girl trapped in a good girl\u2019s body.</p><p>She got some water from the cooler, unwrapped her sandwich, and brooded in the back corner of the lunchroom. How did Max know her type? He probably thought she was a trembling virgin with no experience, swooning at the thought of a man\u2019s erection.</p><p>Hah. He didn\u2019t know anything. Sure, she was still a virgin, but she had had experiences. Deep experiences. The only reason she had stayed away from fully consummating a relationship is she hadn\u2019t found the right man to make her want to get naked and get serious. Most of them were so polite and gentle, she\u2019d been afraid she\u2019d nap through the whole thing. And she certainly wasn\u2019t throwing away her virginity on a drunken encounter or a fling. She wanted an engaged, adult, sexual affair. On her own terms.</p><p>Her fantasies revolved around a man a little rough to command her body in a variety of delicious ways. She may be technically innocent, but she craved a lover to push her in every direction. Physical. Emotional. Now that she was in America, she intended to find him. And maybe Edward fit the bill.</p><p>Her fingers trembled at the thought of Max\u2019s suggestion to meet a man in church. Dio, he was pazzo. He certainly didn\u2019t meet his dates there. He didn\u2019t engage in chaste encounters either. Besides being a Page Six regular, all tabloids loved the single billionaire; many shots clearly showed his weekend conquests. Her heart panged at the thought, but she had long ago accepted she\u2019d never be enough for Maximus Gray.</p><p>The night of her humiliation flickered past her vision. Home from her third year at the university, Michael and Max were visiting, and Max stayed overnight. The plan had been simple. More worldly, better equipped with her physical appearance, she set out to seduce him. She carefully dressed in a sexy black dress, killer heels stolen from her sister\u2019s closet, and stalked him at the fancy cocktail party. The night went beautifully. Max paid attention to her the entire evening. He laughed at her jokes. Touched her arm. Those deep blue eyes stayed engaged for hours. He made no move to socialize with other people, and her spirit soared as she prepared for the second half of her plan.</p><p>With two glasses of wine in hand, she walked out back to meet him on the grounds, hopefully to share their first kiss. Of course, she hadn\u2019t planned on standing in the arched trellis while he kissed another woman. And it was no ordinary woman. No, this one wore a similar black dress as Carina, except her body was long and thin and perfect. Carina watched in horror as Max murmured in her ear, and his hand cupped her rear as he lifted her against him. Arousal blended with a raw jealousy she never experienced\u2014a need to be the woman Max held, the woman he loved.</p><p>The rest came in slow motion. Her anguished gasp. The turn of his head as he gazed at her. The swirling blend of regret, apology, and determination in his eyes. And she knew in that moment it would never be her. The blonde smiled blandly as if Carina was a younger cousin or sister. Hard truths rushed before her. She\u2019d never be competition for all the women who chased after Maximus Gray. She wasn\u2019t beautiful enough or smart enough. She wasn\u2019t sophisticated and witty and sexy. She was just a young girl fresh from college with a crush. He\u2019d humored her for a few hours because of their family connection.</p><p>Carina decided to not rush away. With slow, determined strides, she closed the distance between them and handed him the wine. Max\u2019s fingers brushed hers as he took the glass, and the sizzle of his warm skin almost made her cry. Almost.</p><p>Then she offered his companion the second glass.</p><p>He jerked back as if realizing the symbol of her gesture. Carina looked up at him and memorized his beloved face for the last time. She left him in the garden with the woman and didn\u2019t look back. She surrendered more than the love of her life. She gave up her old dreams and left her old life behind.</p><p>She returned to college and became a different woman, bearing down and throwing her energy into her work. She graduated with honors and enrolled immediately in the SDA Bocconi School of Management, where she completed her MBA and delved into an intense internship. She may not have liked the business world very much, but she was determined to be good at it.</p><p>And she did like the power and control her new skills gave her. She wasn\u2019t a weak little girl who looked to others for her happiness anymore, but a woman who took control and was ready for life\u2019s challenges. A woman who stood on her own feet with savvy business skills and a clear mind. One who would never go after Max again.</p><p>She finished her sandwich, guzzled her water, and pushed her bag away. Working so closely with him was bound to bring up some old memories. She needed to stay true to her vision and move ahead.</p><p>Carina threw away her lunch and got back to work.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Two weeks later, Max wondered if he needed to get laid.</p><p>He glanced at the clock and fought a groan. Almost one o\u2019clock. His stomach roiled from too much coffee. Reports were overdue and an odd tension pulsed in his muscles. What was wrong with him? He\u2019d been on deadline before and never experienced such . . . crankiness. All wound up and nowhere to go. When was the last time he had sex? And where was Carina?</p><p>She blasted through the door with a smile and a greasy bag in one hand as the odd combination of thoughts skittered through his mind. Her skirt was too short for the office and distracted some of the executives, but when he brought it up to Michael her brother didn\u2019t seem to mind. Something about fashion and what was appropriate. Ridiculous. What happened to knee length? And didn\u2019t she ever wear pantyhose? Somehow, not having that barrier only caused more stress, especially with the endless expanse of smooth, naked olive skin.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? I need the updated supply report before I can get over to the new location for a walk-through.\u201d</p><p>Her thick hair was pulled back in a severe knot, showing off the graceful curve of her neck and cheek. Sweat beaded her forehead as she dropped the bag on her desk and threw her briefcase down. \u201cSorry. Wayne called out sick, so I told him I\u2019d cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d He glanced at the calendar. \u201cDamnit, it\u2019s opening day at Yankee Stadium, Carina. He\u2019s full of bullshit. Get him on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Her plump lower lip twitched in amusement. \u201cOh, let him enjoy the game\u2014don\u2019t be so mean. I\u2019ll have them in an hour. Here, maybe this will make you feel better.\u201d She slid out a thick piece of bruschetta pizza, dripping with tomatoes and enough garlic to cause a stir of homesickness. His stomach roared on cue. When was the last time he\u2019d eaten? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if she heard his mental question, she answered. \u201cYou skipped breakfast again. Take a break and I\u2019ll get the report together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hand in the air and reached the door. \u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d His command made her pause. He grabbed the plastic knife and sawed off a piece. \u201cYou don\u2019t go anywhere until you share this with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down or you\u2019re fired.\u201d</p><p>She laughed but obeyed. She dragged over her chair, snatched up the piece with a napkin and dove in. For a few moments, they chewed and enjoyed their food, a common staple in their childhood memories. He relaxed and some of the tension eased from his shoulders. Funny, most women he dated viewed food as a necessity or an evil entity that incited weight gain. How many times had Mama Conte prepared a meal and only he and Carina were left at the table? Their passion for eating in companionable silence was something he\u2019d missed. Michael and his other sisters dove in fast to get back to what they were doing. But when it came to good food, Max loved taking his time and savoring each bite. Carina held the same type of respect and honor for a meal, the way she enjoyed everything in life.</p><p>He snuck a peek. Damn skirt rode way up on her thighs. Her signature stiletto heels should be outlawed for the office and allowed only in a nightclub. They were way too sexy with all those straps. And why didn\u2019t she wear normal perfume? He was used to heavy musk and contrived florals. Instead, she smelled clean and fresh, like cocoa butter and a hint of lemon. Max focused on his pizza. \u201cHow are you holding up? I know I\u2019ve been giving you a lot of work lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Her tongue ran over her lower lip to catch the last bit of olive oil. He shifted his gaze. \u201cI have a new respect for Michael and Julietta. Growing up, I thought it was just about baking desserts and having a case to sell them in.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cSo did I. When Michael first hired me, I had no clue, but we learned together and built an empire. I enjoy having a stake in all the departments, though. Maybe I\u2019m a control freak.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDefinitely. You drove us all crazy when we were kids. Ordered us around and sulked when we didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never sulked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did. And when that didn\u2019t work, you turned those baby blues on any female in sight, and they crumbled. You still do.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in surprise with a bit of embarrassment. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You make me sound like some type of gigolo who uses his looks to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>She took another bite and shrugged. \u201cWell, not just your body. You use your charm, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCut it out. You\u2019re pissing me off.\u201d He tried not to squirm in his seat with the idea she thought his looks got him places. \u201cI didn\u2019t help build an empire without some brains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have brains. That\u2019s where the lethal charm comes in\u2014you know when to use it. If you only had brawn, it would be easier to shrug off.\u201d</p><p>Why was he engaging in this ridiculous conversation? He tried to take the high road but his mouth opened. \u201cI give women the respect they deserve. Always did.\u201d</p><p>She swiped her mouth with the napkin and sat back with her arms crossed in front of her chest. The movement pulled that conservative blouse tight against the heavy swell of her breasts. \u201cWhat about that time Angelina got that new video game, and you convinced her to lend it to you for a whole month?\u201d</p><p>Max sputtered with outrage. \u201cShe was being nice to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Michael said she followed you around like a puppy in school the whole time. When you solved the game, you gave it back to her and barely spoke to her.\u201d</p><p>He shoved the paper plate in the bag and crumpled it up. Irritation whipped through him at the memory. He never meant it like that. He was always nice to Angelina, he just didn\u2019t want to date her.</p><p>\u201cAnd how about that time you got Theresa to do your science report? Michael said you just had to sit with her at lunch and she wrote the whole thing for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did Michael tell all these lies about me?\u201d he grumbled. \u201cThis stuff never happened.\u201d</p><p>Carina lifted her chin in triumph. \u201cHow about this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this morning?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cWeren\u2019t you supposed to attend the party Saturday night at Walter\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and cleaned his desk, but a sputter of unease flared in his gut. \u201cYeah. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Bonnie you were stressed and overworked and needed someone to go in your place. She jumped right in and offered to represent La Dolce Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that make me the bad guy?\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBecause then she asked if you would go with her to the opera, remember? She had an extra ticket. You patted her on the shoulder, told her you were busy, thanked her for going to the party in your place, and left her with a confused expression on her face. Face it, Max. When it comes to women, you are bad news.\u201d</p><p>Shock kept him mute and dumb. With triumph, she rose from the chair and threw out her lunch. \u201cI was busy,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I did not pat her on the shoulder. I don\u2019t do things like that with women.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, she seemed delighted with his objections. \u201cYes, you do. You humor them with the hope they may have a shot with you. Then you pull the rug out from under them. It\u2019s a classic Max move I\u2019ve been seeing for years.\u201d</p><p>Enough was enough. He was not that sort of guy and it was time she realized that. \u201cCarina, I don\u2019t know what kind of man you think I am, but I don\u2019t pull crap like that. No matter what your brother told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael didn\u2019t have to tell me anything. I noticed this for years. You did it with me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His roar escaped before he was able to rein his emotions in. Outrage trembled in every muscle as he stared at her. \u201cI never made an inappropriate move on you.\u201d</p><p>A strange expression flickered across her face before clearing. \u201cNo, of course you didn\u2019t. But you can\u2019t help it, Max. You flirt, and charm, and make women feel like they\u2019re the goddess of your mortal soul. We get wrapped up and then feel shocked when you move on to the next woman.\u201d Carina shrugged. \u201cI was young. I had a crush on you once. I got over it. No biggie. I\u2019ll get your report and be back within the hour.\u201d</p><p>She left him while his head reeled like a cartoon character who got whacked and little birdies floated above. Her matter-of-fact confession rocked his world. Of course, it was all untrue. He didn\u2019t do things like that to women. Right?</p><p>The memory of the party tickled his conscience and whispered him a liar. He remembered, though he wanted to forget. Back from her third year at college, she exploded before him with a youthful energy and passion that stole his breath. He remembered the little black dress she wore in place of her usual baggy T-shirts that made his mouth dry up. Remembered her laugh, and adoring expression, and sassy conversation that always stirred his interest and made him relax. He told himself he was just being a little protective of her because she was like a sister, but his body didn\u2019t react like she was family. He\u2019d grown uncomfortably hard and imagined doing some very bad things. Alone. Without the little black dress.</p><p>His thoughts freaked him out. He realized he treated Carina like a woman during dinner\u2014a woman he was interested in. When the blonde in the garden approached him, he didn\u2019t hesitate. She was the type who knew the score and engaged in full play.</p><p>The kiss had been full of intention, but flat. Max didn\u2019t care until he heard the small gasp behind him. Carina\u2019s eyes still haunted him. Dark depths filled with pain\u2014betrayal.</p><p>He expected her to cry and run. He prepared for drama. Instead, she met him with her head held high and a look of good-bye on her face, handing over the glasses of wine with fingers that trembled. And she left. The grief surprised him, but he buried it quickly and went back to the blonde. He never looked back.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>His conscience pricked. Max wondered if she was right. Did he treat women like objects to conquer in order to get what he wanted? He liked to believe he indulged them. He loved to pamper and treasure and spoil. Sure, he refused to go too deep, but that was only so he could protect them from getting their hearts broken. He was honorable and exactly unlike his father. He remained emotionally distant, but every want was met, and he always remained faithful.</p><p>At least, until the breakup. Much better to cut off the relationship than lead them on. No, being honest may be a little rough, but Carina was dead wrong. Funny, that was the first time she admitted her feelings for him. The easy rejection of her youthful mistake stung his ego, but it was for the best. She acted as if he were an annoying mosquito slapped away and forgotten within a few moments. Was he that easy to get over?</p><p>Why was he even thinking about this now? They\u2019d always be friends. It was enough. It was perfect.</p><p>He pushed the disturbing thoughts away and worked through the next hour. A slight tap at the door broke his concentration. \u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>Laura Wells poked her head in. The director of a well-known supplier, she and he had hit it off a few weeks ago and had a great conversation. One date led to a second, and Max sensed she was the perfect package. Gorgeous with long blond wavy hair, green eyes, a slim body with long legs, and height that nearly matched his, she was also smart and held a common business background. He relaxed and waved her in. \u201cNo, I need a break. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered over with an easy grace. Her sage suit matched her eyes and flattered her lean length. \u201cWanted to see if you\u2019ll save me from an event filled with boredom. I need to go to Walter\u2019s party. Are you going?\u201d</p><p>Max guiltily remembered how he\u2019d pawned it off on Bonnie. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to.\u201d</p><p>She gave a pretty pout. \u201cOh, please come with me, Max. My schedule\u2019s been insane lately and I need to combine some business with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>The look in her eyes told him the outcome of the evening.</p><p>Score.</p><p>He needed this, a night off with a beautiful woman who knew the rules. Maybe the promise of more. At least the promise of a satisfying encounter. \u201cIt would be my honor to escort you. I\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>He stood to walk her out and almost slammed into Carina. Her ruby red lips made a small O and gave him dirty images of what other things she could do with that mouth. He jumped a step back and cursed under his breath. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cJumpy today, huh? Oh, hello. I\u2019m Carina Conte.\u201d</p><p>Laura smiled and they shook hands. A sense of pleasure washed over him. Finally, he\u2019d show her he was serious about his companions and treated them perfectly. He made the introductions. \u201cLaura will be my date for Walter\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>Carina\u2019s smile never dimmed. \u201cHow lovely. You really should come to dinner one night at my brother\u2019s house. Guests of Max are always welcome.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Uneasiness shot through him. Laura looked a bit too eager. He shuffled his feet and tried to feign enthusiasm. \u201cUm, of course. I\u2019ll get back to you on some dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday nights,\u201d Carina chirped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to. Thanks so much.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. What was she doing? He wasn\u2019t ready for Laura to attend family events. Max frowned. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p> <p>Carina held out a stack of papers. \u201cHere are the reports. The Yankees won. The second floor had the game on, and Wayne got nailed in a photo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to reprimand him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak with him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time you allow a sick day, check the baseball schedule. And make sure they\u2019re not hungover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p> <p>Her efficiency surprised him as much as her cool control. No matter what he gave her, she took it and never complained. In a matter of weeks she\u2019d charmed the staff with her heart and humor. \u201cHeard you let Tom go early today, too. I needed those sales figures. What was his excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to miss his son\u2019s spring concert.\u201d She didn\u2019t even wince. \u201cI contacted Edward, and he\u2019s going to help me get them to you within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll need you to work late tonight again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The door opened again and Edward came in. Max\u2019s office suddenly resembled Grand Central Station. \u201cHey, boss. Heard you need sales reports this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed them hours ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarina and I will work on them now.\u201d Edward smiled at Laura, and Carina jumped in to make introductions. They chatted as if at an intimate tea party instead of the office. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see you at the party then. Let\u2019s try to sit together,\u201d Edward said.</p><p>Max lifted a brow. \u201cSit together? Are you going?\u201d</p><p>Edward grinned. \u201cSure. I\u2019m taking Carina with me.\u201d</p><p>He watched as his assistant shot his salesperson an intimate smile. As if she also intended to combine business with pleasure at this party. Irritation scratched through him at the image of Carina sleeping with Edward. For God\u2019s sake, didn\u2019t she listen anymore? He curbed his temper. Time to have another little chat. And be a bit more forceful this time. Max ushered Laura and Edward out, and motioned for Carina to stay in his office.</p><p>\u201cLaura seems very nice.\u201d</p><p>His gaze tried to strip off her polite veneer but came up empty. \u201cShe is. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re attending a work party with a business associate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany office employees attend these parties together.\u201d</p><p>Her bland tone challenged him to take it up a notch. \u201cYou made it clear I should stay out of your private business. But I\u2019m concerned about your reputation at La Dolce Maggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. A slight tremble in her hands finally steadied. Her new ability to rein in her emotions intrigued his dominant instincts to push. \u201cYou are a founding member of this company. You don\u2019t want it leaked around the office that you\u2019re easy.\u201d</p><p>A flush hit her cheeks but she remained still. \u201cEasy? One date and you have me whoring around the office, huh?\u201d</p><p>He almost jerked back but caught himself. \u201cRumors are easy to start. I already saw the way Ethan in accounting was following you around like a trained puppy. Are you dating him, too?\u201d</p><p>The slow smile threw him off. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u201d</p><p>He stared at this woman he didn\u2019t know anymore. \u201cI\u2019m looking out for your career. I told you many times American men are different. I want you to be careful. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disrespect me more than any man wanting to get me into bed, Max.\u201d Tiny puffs of breath escaped her lips, but she remained in control. Not one stray curl escaped her ruthless chignon. Her almond eyes simmered with a banked heat he itched to play with. \u201cMen with physical needs are quite simple. But you use that masterful brain of yours to play head games. Setting up women for the kill. You like to control all the elements on the playing field so no one gets hurt, don\u2019t you? But poor Laura is already falling for you, and you won\u2019t even invite her to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Merda, when had she gotten so sarcastic? \u201cLaura knows the rules. You do not.\u201d</p><p>She gave a humorless laugh and moved in. Her cherry red fingernails snapped at his tie in pure dismissal. \u201cI\u2019m making my own rules now. And I\u2019m more honest than you.\u201d Her scent wrapped around him and made him want to run in circles like a dog trying to catch his tail. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have a real relationship if your life depended on it, so you\u2019ve focused your attention on me. Nice diversion, but it\u2019s not going to work this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about me and my relationships. All I\u2019m trying to do is guide a young girl through her training. Just like Michael asked me.\u201d</p><p>His final shot caught its mark. Anger steamed from her pores. She teetered on the edge of her famous temper, and he prepared for the ensuing drama\u2014almost welcomed it. This Carina he knew and could handle.</p><p>Instead, she brought herself back from the edge and shot him an almost pitying stare. Took a few steps back. The severe cut of her black jacket only emphasized the earthy curves of her hips and breasts, a delicious contradiction that hardened his dick and screwed with his head. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you need to believe to sleep at night, so be it. But while you\u2019re comfortable with your illusions, know this. I don\u2019t care what you do anymore, Max. Your relationships don\u2019t concern me, but mine do. And if I want to boink Tom, Dick, and Harry in my own private time, stay out of it. Because I don\u2019t want to sleep comfortably at night.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her heels clicked on the polished wood. \u201cI\u2019ll be in accounting if you need me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at the closed door for a while. This was no longer a girl he faced. This was a full-blown Eve, and he was in more trouble than he thought. He raked back his control and wondered what the emptiness in his gut meant. Since he didn\u2019t know how to get rid of it, Max guzzled some water and moved on.</p><p>Just like he always did.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Carina walked around the tiny loft apartment. Boxes littered the gunmetal carpet and the kitchen barely had enough room to fit a person with generous hips. The canary yellow futon splashed color and mixed with the array of crazed watercolors hung on the wall. Definitely not an artist worthy of a showing, but at least they were cheery and interesting to look at. The large windows opened to view an array of towering trees, as if she lived in a modern tree house from one of those fantasy movies.</p><p>It was perfect.</p><p>Joy splintered through her. Alexa\u2019s apartment was her first official home that was all her own. Finally, she had the privacy she craved, and an endless array of opportunities stretched ahead of her. She didn\u2019t intend to waste a single moment.</p><p>And it started tomorrow night with her first official date.</p><p>Footsteps echoed. Michael and Max pushed through the narrow doorway and collapsed on the sagging futon. \u201cThat\u2019s the last of it.\u201d</p><p>She giggled at the sight of two strapping, masculine men huffing over the long climb. \u201cI thought you guys worked out at the gym every day. Yet here you are exhausted over moving a few boxes.\u201d</p><p>They shared a look of incredulity. \u201cAre you kidding me? What did you put in those boxes, anyway? Stones?\u201d her brother asked.</p><p>\u201cI need lots of shoes. And my art equipment.\u201d</p><p>Max glared. \u201cThere must be three hundred stairs, all twisty and narrow. And where the hell is the air-conditioning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexa said the unit is ancient. And I told you to hire movers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. We wanted to be involved.\u201d</p><p>Carina held back a sigh. \u201cFine. Thank you both, but why don\u2019t you get going? I have to unpack and get settled. Maggie mentioned a benefit dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Michael groaned and stood up. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She\u2019s going to be crazed about what to wear and no matter how many times I tell her she looks great, she says she looks fat.\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed. \u201cJust remind her she\u2019s not fat\u2014just carrying two extra bodies in her small belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Are you going to be okay? Do you need anything?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and kissed him on the cheek. \u201cNiente. I\u2019m excited to get settled and have everything I need. I love you, Michael.\u201d</p><p>His face gentled and he kissed the top of her head. \u201cI love you too. Max? Coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Her brother left and she shifted her glance to Max.</p><p>Oh. My.</p><p>His dark hair was adorably mussed and a fine sheen of sweat gleamed on his brow. His worn T-shirt clung damply to a mass of carved muscle from his abs, pecs, biceps, and other yummy places. The ancient jeans hugged his ass and dropped low on his hips in a wicked invitation for a woman to play. He always seemed to loom over her in that delicious dominant way that made her tummy drop, especially since the top of her head only hit his chin. Well versed in ignoring her physical attraction to the man, she focused on her task.</p><p>Carina grabbed the first box and ripped it open with the box cutter. \u201cMax, there\u2019s no need to stay. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But I\u2019m thirsty. Want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and unfurled himself from the couch. When he returned from the kitchen, he held out a frosty Moretti. Strong tanned fingers brushed hers. \u201cHousewarming present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYum.\u201d She pressed the icy cold bottle to her cheek and rolled it down over her neck. The chill peppered her flesh, and she sighed with pleasure. \u201cFeels so good.\u201d</p><p>He made a strangled sound in his throat. She shifted her gaze, and dark blue eyes pinned her with heat. Her breath hitched, but she managed to fight past it and take a step back. Funny, she never saw that look on his face before. Almost like he was . . . hungry.</p><p>She drank her beer in a thick, heavy silence. She spoke first and tried to cut through the odd tension. \u201cSo, big plans for the weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the site walk-through on Monday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of my new place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead any good books lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the Kama Sutra.\u201d That got his attention. He scowled but offered nothing further. \u201cHave you read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d His husky drawl promised he did fine without the well-known sex manual.</p><p>She paused mid-sip. Temper nipped as she realized he still tried to intimidate her with his towering height and primitive, masculine energy. He was a walking, breathing, living Sex God and she was sick to death of being in his shadow. Carina narrowed her eyes, and her voice snapped. \u201cIf you have nothing to talk about or offer here, I think you should be on your way. I have a lot of work to do.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flitted across his carved features. His lip quirked. \u201cAm I bothering you or something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Or something. If all you want to do is look like a poster for Calvin Klein, please go somewhere else. I\u2019m sure your other women will appreciate the view.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his beer and stared at her as if she\u2019d turned green. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d She slammed down the bottle on the battered coffee table and began unpacking. His body heat pulsed close behind her, but she ignored him.</p><p>\u201cHave you gone nuts? Why is my appearance suddenly so irritating to you? I thought we\u2019d hang out a bit. Order a pizza. No big deal.\u201d</p> <p>She grit her teeth at his arrogance. \u201cThank you for the generous offer of your company, Max. But I have a lot to do and I\u2019d like to be alone. We never hung out before unless Michael was around, and I need to get organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the whole weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the party tomorrow, so I\u2019d like to have most of my stuff done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the party. With Edward.\u201d</p><p>She cut him a warning look. The scene in his office still burned, but she\u2019d be damned if he ever knew. She was done playing games with the man. Time to give him a taste of what she always went through. An inquisition. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to hanging out more with Laura. I\u2019ll tell Michael I invited her to dinner next week.\u201d</p> <p>That got his attention. His lithe frame stiffened. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you don\u2019t invite my dates to events without my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Laura, but I\u2019m in no rush. Meeting family is important.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cAnother one bites the dust, huh? Too bad, I thought she had enough to interest you for a while.\u201d He sucked in his breath. She moved on to the next box with a ruthless efficiency and told herself not to engage. Unfortunately, he stepped in front of her and forced her to spar.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the women I date? Just because I move slow and careful does not mean I can\u2019t settle.\u201d</p><p>Carina threw back her head and laughed. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good one. If I had a dollar for every wrong woman you chose I\u2019d be richer than you. But you didn\u2019t listen to me when we were young, and you\u2019re not now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cName one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSally Eckerson.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWe dated for three months. A successful relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, interesting. She ended up sleeping with your friend Dale, remember?\u201d</p><p>He scrunched up his face, deep in thought. \u201cOh, yeah. But we had broken it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you broke it off after you found her in bed with your roommate. Then there was the blond model you dated who had an IQ of a whopping one. Maybe two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna? Not true, we had plenty of good conversations.\u201d</p><p>She stared him down until he shifted his feet. \u201cMax, you brought her to dinner at Mama\u2019s house. She didn\u2019t know there was a war in Iraq or who the president of the U.S. was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, she wasn\u2019t a historian. Big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe admitted she didn\u2019t read books without pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVogue has articles in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just like you read Playboy for the in-depth stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfair. I happen to love women\u2014all women\u2014and give them a chance. Just because I haven\u2019t found The One doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not trying.\u201d</p><p>Carina shook her head. \u201cI watched them enter and exit the door my whole life. You\u2019re trying with all the wrong women for a reason. You have intimacy issues. Each one is doomed to failure.\u201d Her traitorous heart wobbled and caved an inch. Why couldn\u2019t he see what she did every time she gazed at him? A man full of love who was too afraid to give it? But she knew by practice he\u2019d never be ready to settle down. He refused to date anyone who was worthy of him, because then he\u2019d be out of excuses. By dating women he couldn\u2019t hurt, he was saving himself from his own personal nightmare.</p><p>Becoming his father.</p><p>He never talked about him, but the wound of being abandoned as a baby never truly healed. He\u2019d set himself up to impossible standards in order to protect himself from ever making the same mistake. Losing his honor. Abandoning the people he loved. The easy fix was evident\u2014he refused to take a chance on anyone.</p><p>She reached up and touched his face. The rough stubble scraped against her fingers, and the delicious scent of male heat and sweat and musk rose to her nostrils.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like your father, Max.\u201d He jerked back. Shock filled his eyes, but she gave him no time to process her statement, or catalogue her weakness for him. \u201cI appreciate the beer and the help. But I really need to get to work. I\u2019ll see you on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>This time, she deliberately turned her back on him. Seconds ticked by. Then she heard the clink of the glass on the table and the door shut behind her.</p><p>Carina sagged with relief. She\u2019d never walk that path again. She\u2019d never be the woman to save him, and he\u2019d never love her the way she needed. But there was a whole new world out there that opened in possibility, and she\u2019d be a fool not to take advantage. Starting with her date.</p><p>Carina plucked her iPod from her purse, slid up the volume, and got to work.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The Farmers Craft Festival attracted a huge crowd in the Hudson Valley. Max made his way through the field of tents stretched out over acres of fairgrounds and stopped occasionally to examine local artists\u2019 wares. Tables held a delightful array of unique items, from carved pottery to hand-painted birdhouses to watercolor canvases. Local businesses rolled out the red carpet for the event and held various demonstrations to entice guests; there were local charities, police and fire houses, karate and yoga schools. May bestowed the gift of sun and heat, and everyone ran around in shorts and tank tops, ready for an early summer.</p><p>Max breathed in the scents of grease and sugar, grabbed a homemade lemonade, and headed toward their tent. The screams of children from the bouncy tent echoed in the air, and a sense of peace settled over him. It was interesting how he\u2019d adopted upstate New York as his second home without a bump. The majestic mountain peaks shimmered in the distance and reminded him they remained king, squeezing the Hudson River within their grip. He loved the familiarity of the locals without the usual snobbiness reserved for outsiders. Here, they were all family, welcomed the moment one decided to adopt a local town as his own.</p><p>Max took a hard right, stopping occasionally to chat with various business owners, and kept a lookout for the big sign. He hadn\u2019t been able to oversee this event, but he trusted David to wow him. He worked well with the chef at their new store, and the samples they decided on were a winning combination. Thank God he\u2019d vetoed the chocolate\u2014it would have been a melty mess on a hot day like this.</p><p>His gaze snagged on the huge banner and the crowd squeezed around the table. Yes. Their desserts were a huge hit if the line was any indication. A flash of white moved in and out, and a familiar husky laugh raked his ears in a caress.</p><p>Then he saw her.</p><p>Definitely not David.</p><p>She wore tiny little white shorts that did nothing to hide her magnificent ass. Her top should have been conservative enough since the fabric covered everything, but the bright yellow only directed attention to the thrust of her breasts. Her hair was bunched up underneath a ball cap with LA DOLCE MAGGIE spelled out in black lettering, and flirty gold hoops swung on her earlobes. His gaze automatically took in those tanned muscled legs to her feet. Just as he thought. With every other woman wearing flip-flops, she stood out in three-inch yellow sandals that were impractical, ridiculous, and sexy as hell.</p><p>What the hell was she doing here?</p><p>He pushed his way toward the front of the table but she still didn\u2019t notice him. She flew back and forth with samples of cassata\u2014a sponge cake plump with cannoli cream and soaked in liqueur. Bite-size pieces of tort di treviglio looked fresh and tempting, and the honey biscotti seemed a big hit with the children. Juggling conversation and glasses of iced mocha coffee, Carina chatted, laughed, and handed out a dizzying array of flyers. Her face gleamed with sweat but she never faltered. The two interns played back up, but even Max could see they were out of their element. Rushing back and forth on lanky legs, they seemed unable to properly work the espresso machine and used their time to gape at their gorgeous female boss.</p><p>As if she finally sensed his gaze, Carina stopped mid-flight and turned her head.</p><p>Something weird squeezed his chest\u2014an uncomfortable tightness he never experienced. The odd urge to take her in his arms flooded him and he took a step forward. Thank God he didn\u2019t finish the movement. With a casual wave, she smiled and went back to her job as if he\u2019d never appeared.</p><p>Ego slapped down to size, he cleared his throat and tried to get a grip.</p><p>He pushed his way forward and glared. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where\u2019s David?\u201d</p><p>She never broke stride and took her time to answer. \u201cWasn\u2019t able to make it. I\u2019m covering.\u201d</p><p>Max smothered a curse. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHis wife\u2019s pregnant. He was in the ER last night with her\u2014she had false contractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he was exhausted and wanted to stay with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Edward or Tom? They\u2019re supposed to play backup.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and doled out a biscotti. \u201cThey had plans. I told them I\u2019d take over.\u201d</p><p>This time the curse escaped. Her management skills were nonexistent when it came to playing the hard-ass. She let the employees get away with ridiculous stunts they\u2019d never to think to pull on him. She was smart, savvy, and a complete pushover. Her heart got her in trouble every time. \u201cYou should have called me, Carina. Dio, I\u2019m going to slaughter my sales force on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes snapped with temper. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare. Besides, I want to be here. I needed to learn the desserts, what sells and what doesn\u2019t. I learned more in the last few hours than I ever did in the office. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>The two teenagers took a break from the machine hissing in crankiness and walked over. \u201cHi, Mr. Gray,\u201d they greeted in unison.</p><p>He nodded and tried not to seem like a mean old man. \u201cHi, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, Carina, we\u2019re having trouble keeping up with the espresso. I can\u2019t seem to get it to work right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Carl, I\u2019ll check it. Here, do the pastries for now. Don\u2019t forget the flyers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Max eased his way toward the side of the L-shaped table where the professional espresso maker loomed with monstrous proportions. She fanned herself and attacked the shiny robotic levers. \u201cYou\u2019re management, Carina. The staff is playing you big-time. You moved yesterday and have to be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a smile full of sass. \u201cSpeak for yourself. I\u2019m eight years younger than you. Stamina is not my problem.\u201d</p><p>He had a sudden urge to tear off her clothes, tumble her in the field, and teach her about real stamina. The image of her naked and moaning under him assaulted his vision. \u201cWatch out, little girl. I may have to prove you wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead of backing down, she hooted with laughter. \u201cAre you kidding? The only type of stamina I need right now is a man who can make a hundred cups of coffee in record time. I bet you don\u2019t even know how to make a decent espresso.\u201d</p><p>He placed his lemonade down on the table and stared in disbelief. \u201cYou did not just say that to me. I\u2019m Italian. I\u2019ve been making homemade espresso my entire life.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and finally tamed the machine. A trickle of dark liquid poured into the cup, and the scent of rich roasted beans hit his nostrils. \u201cSure, in your nice shiny kitchen with your gourmet equipment. Why don\u2019t you get your hands dirty, boss, and show me what you got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you challenging me?\u201d</p> <p>Carina shrugged. \u201cForget it. Wouldn\u2019t want to ruin your fancy clothes.\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse, tossed his lemonade in the trash, and stalked behind the table. With efficient motions, he donned a pair of gloves, snatched an extra ball cap, and grabbed her shoulders. Her startled jump matched his own as the sexual electricity zinged between them. He moved her out of the way. The machine spit out a billow of steam as if their sudden intimate moment pissed it off.</p><p>He yanked back his hands and covered it up with a growl. \u201cStep aside.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils dilated as if recognizing and responding to the command in his voice. Max grew hot, and it had nothing to do with the weather or the coffee. Something about the awareness in her dark eyes hit him where it hurt. Right in his dick.</p><p>\u201cTime me.\u201d</p> <p>Max knew there were certain rules in perfecting a great cup of espresso. Ingredients were primary\u2014pure arabica beans medium roasted and not toasted, fresh water without any lingering chemicals to dilute the taste, and the proper machine. The rest was skill, especially the right amount of pressure used in the tamping process, which could make or break the balance. He fell into the rhythm perfected from years of impressing women and his own mother. Remove filter holder. Add fresh-ground coffee. Tamp while holding filter holder off to the side. Polish. Pour. Serve. Repeat.</p><p>Max felt her gaze on him but refused to break his meditative trance and engage in banter. How dare the woman insult his skill?</p><p>Carl whistled as he twisted and served four cups at once. \u201cDamn, Mr. Gray, that\u2019s some serious moves you got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Come over here and let me show you. One day you\u2019ll get one of these bad boys and impress the heck out of some girl.\u201d He winked. \u201cMaybe even close the deal.\u201d</p><p>The kid\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHell, yeah. Bring it.\u201d</p><p>Max tutored the interns in the fine art of seduction via coffee. Carina reached past him to grab the cinnamon. \u201cWhy do men turn everything into a way to score women?\u201d The side of her breast brushed his shoulder and his hand slipped on the lever. The machine spit in fury.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, you broke my rhythm. And the answer is simple. Men have only two things they ever think about: food and women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes sports,\u201d Carl said seriously.</p><p>Carina sighed.</p><p>The next few hours flew by in a whirl of activity until every bone in Max\u2019s body ached. Still, there was something about them working together that fit, until each motion seemed coordinated. The back-and-forth banter between them made the work fun. Max realized he had the tendency to be a bit too serious, and her playful quips fascinated the interns, who always saw him as stuffy.</p><p>He also noticed the long line of men coming up for seconds and peering around the table to get a glimpse of bare skin exposed from the tiny white shorts. Carina seemed to sense the attention and play it up. Each man left the booth looking a bit bedazzled, which only pissed him off. Were men that simpleminded that a saucy wink or swing of the hips caused them to lose brain function?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Especially with Carina. Her body was killer, but it was her ability to laugh and be open that grabbed a male\u2019s full attention. She made them crave to be in the spotlight. Her spotlight. Max shoved a cup at the nerd gaping in front of him a little too firmly. The liquid sloshed over the rim and he yelped.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve worn the sales uniform,\u201d he said. \u201cThat outfit\u2019s a bit too eye-catching.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes like he was an older uncle. \u201cSure, a black pantsuit would really make me fit in. It\u2019s almost eighty degrees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to retain a professional image.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh did bad things to his gut. \u201cOh, Max, you\u2019re a hoot. Why do you think I wore these shorts?\u201d The naughty wink stole his breath and made him feel like a fool. \u201cYou taught me well. No reason not to use your body, charm, and brain to step things up a bit, hmmm?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Max was rendered speechless by a slip of a girl who had turned into a challenger worthy of any man. She seemed to sense her victory and, with a tiny smirk, served the last of the customers.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Carina stared at herself in the full-length mirror.</p><p>She looked hot.</p><p>Pleasure rolled through her as she turned and watched the long skirt swish past her legs. The royal blue fabric emphasized her golden brown skin and dark hair. Definitely a long way from her old wardrobe and desire to hide. Nope, this dress screamed \u201cI am here,\u201d and she loved it.</p><p>The bodice was snug and covered her properly but the back was the real eye opener. She thought about twisting herself into one of those awful female contraptions to hold her bust in, then decided to skip the bra. Just the barest hint of her nipples showed\u2014a tease rather than a full-out display. It made her feel sexy and naked under the fabric. Naughty.</p><p>Exactly what she needed to get ready for her date.</p><p>The strains of Flo Rida pumped through the room and she shook her hips to the grinding notes as she applied her makeup. Hopefully, Edward would find her outfit just as tempting, and the chemistry would fly between them. She imagined his hand sliding under her bodice to play with her bare breasts, twisting the hard nub between his fingers while she arched up, parted her legs and\u2014</p><p>An image of Max\u2019s face flashed before her.</p><p>She paused in applying the kohl to her eyes and scowled at herself in the mirror. Damn him. Why did he have to be so frikkin sexy all the time? She\u2019d never thought he\u2019d join her at the fair in the booth. He looked all cool and elegant in his proper green knit shirt, khakis, and leather loafers. Perfectly tousled hair blowing in the breeze, that aristocratic nose held in the air while he berated her, she couldn\u2019t help but taunt him, never believing he\u2019d take the dare. The man was in charge of the whole company, yet he worked the espresso machine like a master and even charmed her two interns into thinking he was a cool dude.</p><p>Carina shivered at the memory. He had some serious skills. Those elegant fingers skimmed across buttons and levers like a lover, coaxing the best from the machine. After the first hour, he actually relaxed and seemed to be having fun. Those white teeth flashed as he smiled and engaged with the crowd, his muscles bunching and rippling with each twist and turn of his body. She found herself staring at his ass way too much\u2014the soft fabric cupping his rear and making her want things. Bad things. With Max.</p><p>Carina closed her eyes. Dio, she had to stop thinking about him like that. Tonight, she intended to get to know Edward better and hopefully engage in some hot foreplay. This was her first official date in America as her own woman, and she wasn\u2019t about to screw it up by salivating over Max.</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>She finished her makeup and grabbed her designer sandals. The crisscross straps wrapped up her legs and shimmered with sapphires. God, she loved shoes. When she battled her weight problem, she discovered her passion for footwear. They never made her look fat, and it was a great way to raise her self-esteem. Her scarlet red toenails matched her lips.</p><p>Carina slid on some bangle bracelets and swishy silver earrings and grabbed her shawl and beaded bag. Then headed out the door.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Max looked at his companion and wondered why he felt nothing.</p><p>He\u2019d been attracted to her for a while. After her bold comment in his office, he realized she wanted to take their relationship to the next level. The conversation with Carina burned in his ears, and it was time he proved her wrong. Laura exhibited everything he\u2019d been looking for, and this time Carina couldn\u2019t taunt him about snagging the wrong woman.</p><p>He ordered Laura a glass of wine and found a seat in the corner. Scanning the room, Max kept one ear on her comments and his gaze on the other guests. As the minutes ticked by, he wondered if Carina changed her mind and canceled her date. He almost longed to cancel his own. The long hours at the fair gave him a slight sunburn, a sore back from bending over, and a hard-on that wouldn\u2019t go away. Not that he cared. He enjoyed Laura\u2019s tinkling laugh, along with the generous show of cleavage from her black dress. His odd reaction toward Carina concerned him, and he admitted it had been a while since he pleasured a woman. Too much work and too little play, Max joked to himself.</p><p>She walked in.</p><p>Odd, she\u2019d been a part of the seams of his life for so long, he never noticed her back home. Here, her presence burned bright, as if the sun peeked out from stormy skies to tempt beachgoers with a taste of heat. The past years changed and ripened both her body and mind, until the result stormed past him like a pack of racehorses toward the finish line.</p><p>Max surrendered and stared.</p><p>She favored color now. She used to cloak her body in olive greens and grays in an effort to hide. Tonight, she tossed caution and seized a spotlight in pure temptation.</p><p>Thank God her legs were finally covered. The filmy, draped royal blue fabric flowed and stretched over those generous hips and breasts and swished to the floor. He caught a glimpse of matching stilettos as she walked, her head thrown back in a laugh. Her heavy mass of dark chocolate curls was pinned up and bared the vulnerable curve of her neck.</p><p>Edward held her elbow in a possessive gesture and whispered something in her ear. She laughed again and turned.</p><p>The air rushed out of his lungs. Her naked back gleamed in the dim lights, her rich olive skin beckoning for him to run his tongue down the line of her spine for a taste. The fabric gathered at her waist and left far too much skin available for view. How could she wear a bra with a dress like that? His gaze sharpened as she moved across the room.</p><p>The tight thrust of her nipples shadowed the delicate fabric. A punch of savage lust rippled through him and left him reeling. Confirmed. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. Those heavy breasts swayed freely and teased every damn man in the room with a game of hide and go peek. Ignoring the crowd and seemingly in a world of their own, the couple took directly to the dance floor. Edward held her tight, way too tight by the looks of it, his hand roaming over the thrust of her hip to settle at the top of her ass. What the hell? They just arrived and he couldn\u2019t keep his hands to himself? They didn\u2019t even look around to see who was here. This was a dinner party for Christ\u2019s sake, not a nightclub. What happened to proper introductions?</p><p>\u201cDarling? What has you so distracted this evening?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Hard. Then forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just saw a friend of mine. Do you mind if I leave you for a moment?\u201d</p><p>Her teeth flashed blindingly and gave him a headache. Whose teeth were that white anyway? \u201cOf course. As long as it\u2019s not too long.\u201d The deliberate pout spoke volumes. He could definitely take her to bed tonight. He filed the thought away and crossed the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moody strains of Adele rushed past his ears. He weaved his way through tangled couples and reached them. Her head moved an inch. His gaze caught hers.</p><p>An endless depth of black pulled him in and sucked deep. Awareness flared and burned as those eyes widened. He recognized the attraction\u2014was experienced with the push and pull of arousal. His skin prickled. The primitive need to pull her away from Edward and claim her rocketed through him. He reached over and\u2014</p><p>\u201cMax. What a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Edward swung around and grinned. \u201cHey boss. Thought you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlans changed.\u201d He gave a tight smile. \u201cMind if I cut in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Edward bowed and elicited a giggle from Carina. \u201cMilady, I will claim you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Her face broke open in delight and pissed him off. \u201cThank you, kind sir.\u201d</p><p>Max grasped her fingers, brought them to his shoulder and pressed his body against hers. The tight tips of her breasts brushed against his shirt. His temper rose as fast as his dick to full attention. \u201cHave I stepped into the fucking Middle Ages?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Cranky from working too hard at the festival?\u201d</p><p>His brows snapped down. \u201cNo. Just never pegged you for the cutesy type.\u201d Well, at least not now. The old Carina reminded him of giggles and whispers behind cupped hands about boys. The one he held now bespoke a woman in need of being tamed and taken.</p><p>\u201cYou never pegged me for a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold and eased an inch closer. The scent of clean female skin and fresh cucumber teased his nostrils. How can something so innocent and pure create such a primitive rush of lust? Crap, he felt as if he was falling into frikkin Wonderland and scrambled for escape. \u201cNice dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit provocative, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019re not even wearing a bra.\u201d</p><p>She stopped dancing. Tilted her chin all the way up to stare back at him with a shocked glint in her eyes. Spots of pink dotted her cheeks. \u201cYou did not just say that to me.\u201d</p><p>He slid one arm down to the base of her spine and flattened his palm against naked flesh. The silkiness of her skin only tightened his temper another dangerous notch. \u201cDo you think Edward is the type not to take that as an invitation? I\u2019m trying to look out for you. Be a friend.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her voice a furious whisper. \u201cSeems you\u2019ve been quite focused on my wardrobe lately, and who I\u2019ve got my eye on. You\u2019re trying to run my life and hate the fact you can\u2019t anymore. What I wear or don\u2019t wear under my clothes is not your concern. Why are you even dancing with me? Where\u2019s Laura?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a little sister to me.\u201d Max looked up with a touch of guilt. His companion sat quietly, drinking her wine and waiting for him to return. What was he doing? He had a willing female who craved his attention, and he chased after the only one who didn\u2019t want him. \u201cLaura can handle herself for a few moments.\u201d</p><p>Carina snorted. \u201cI bet. Back off, Max. I\u2019m not going to tell you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t come running to me when your date expects more than you\u2019re willing to give.\u201d</p><p>She transformed back into the ice queen he longed to melt. A cool smile curved scarlet lips. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019m willing to give a lot.\u201d</p><p>Damn her. The top of her head only hit his chest. Her petiteness should be a complete mismatch to his height, but instead she fit perfectly\u2014a handful of warm, soft flesh. Her full breasts pressed against him, and the length of her legs played a teasing game, scissoring back and forth in between his in sensuous foreplay. He imagined pushing her thighs apart and finding her slick with welcome. Imagined that lush mouth opening in a gasp as he pleasured her with his tongue, making her writhe and scream his name. Imagined\u2014</p><p>\u201cI guess Laura\u2019s getting lucky tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Her outrageous comment strangled a laugh from him. Next he\u2019d see the Mad Hatter on the dance floor. Holy shit, he was going nuts. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat look on your face. All intense and sexy. She\u2019s good enough to bed but not go to dinner, right?\u201d</p><p>Direct hit. Her verbal foreplay pissed him off and made him hard. \u201cWrong. She has everything I want in a woman. Which completely negates your ridiculous theory that I pick the wrong women because I\u2019m afraid of intimacy.\u201d</p><p>She eased her hands around his broad shoulders, slipped her fingers into his hair, and forced his head down to meet her gaze. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Heat punched deep within and broke open in a rush. Her tongue slid out and wet her bottom lip in a deliberate teasing gesture. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>A husky laugh broke from her throat. The sound poured over his body like creamy butter. \u201cPoor Max, you can\u2019t even see it. Laura has one tiny flaw that\u2019s a deal breaker for you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cOkay, what is it, Madame I-Can-See-Your-Future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates animals.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her smug expression and fought the need to kiss it off her face. \u201cNot possible. You\u2019d never know that anyway, you\u2019re just messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want,\u201d she stated airily. \u201cAsk her later and see what she says. Poor Rocky will be kicked off to the dog shelter. No way is she going near a pit bull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have any problem with Rocky. He\u2019s harmless.\u201d</p><p>Her cool, detached tone taunted him until he ached to push her. \u201cWhen you take her home you\u2019ll find out yourself. Rocky will be in the doghouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out.\u201d Edward began walking toward them. Dance was officially over. He released her as Adele stretched out her last note in a soulful, plaintive cry of loneliness. Regret and something else, something deeper coursed through him. \u201cBe careful tonight, Carina.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. He sucked in his breath at the transformation from innocent to temptress\u2014from the mysterious glint in her eyes to the seductive tug of her lips. \u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll be having as much fun as you tonight.\u201d</p><p>With a toss of her head, she left him on the dance floor and walked right into Edward\u2019s arms.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Jerk.</p><p>Carina burned with righteous anger that ran thick through her veins. She smiled up at Edward as he replaced Max, and tried to immerse herself in the dance. How dare he get all caveman on her? Especially after casually informing her of his intentions to bed the lovely Laura, as if she were just some buddy of his he liked to brag about his conquests with? Oh, she was so done with his pompous ego and inability to see the truth.</p><p>That woman was a facade. Try to push past her flawless skin and witty conversation and you\u2019d find nothing but smoke, no heart. After their conversation, she\u2019d run into Laura in the office parking lot, who was practically hysterical from the stray dog that wandered by the building.</p><p>Her face filled with horror at the mangy mutt, and she\u2019d obviously called security in a panic. Carina had to jump in and intercede before the poor thing got carted away to doggy jail. She\u2019d knelt down and whispered, and after a bit the dog came tentatively over, and even gave her a half lick. Obviously a sweetie pie without a mean gene in his body.</p><p>Laura didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She shuddered and pointed a long fingernail toward the dog. \u201cI hate animals,\u201d she stated. \u201cThey\u2019re so messy and dirty and needy. Carina, please don\u2019t touch it. It probably has diseases. Let the control people take it away.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Carina discovered why Max dated Laura. Another deficiency. A big one. Max adored animals and could never be comfortable with a woman who didn\u2019t love Rocky and want a houseful of pets. The man was a major pain in the ass, but he had a mushy heart.</p><p>She fought back a groan. Oh, Dio, she was doing it again. Getting upset over Max\u2019s choices. Involving herself in his life to the demise of hers. When would she ever learn? Carina took a deep breath and relaxed. Edward slid his hands to rest on the small of her back just like Max. The heavy warmth settled against her skin in comfort. She loved the feel of a man\u2019s arms around her\u2014the possibilities of intimacy and an exchange she craved with every cell in her body.</p><p>Sure, there was no crazy zing like when Max touched her. She doubted any other man would make her light up like a Christmas tree gone haywire. But it didn\u2019t matter. There was enough chemistry to take it to the next level tonight. Edward was attractive, funny, and she wanted to feel his lips over hers, craving to experience the intoxicating passion of intense kissing and foreplay.</p><p>It was embarrassing how badly she ached for a sense of danger and roughness. Most men treated her so sweetly, as if she was a delicate flower about to break. The slow slide of lips and tentative exploration of tongue frustrated her to such an extent she usually broke off the embrace. Maybe Edward would finally be able to satisfy her darkest cravings for less . . . politeness. What would it be like for a man to want her so badly he\u2019d take her without permission? Goose bumps flicked over her skin at the naughty thought.</p><p>Hopefully, she\u2019d find out. Tonight.</p><p>The evening passed in a blur of social niceties, fine wine, and occasional glances toward Max. She kept her distance, but when she came out of the ladies\u2019 room, she noticed the two men at the bar, deep in conversation. Carina took a hard right and involved herself in chatter with some older ladies in the bakery business, determined not to run into Max again. Working with him was bad enough, but now he stuck his nose into her personal business. Her face burned at the memory of his bra comment.</p><p>\u201cCarina?\u201d</p><p>She turned, and Edward linked his hand casually with hers. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I decided to come to the party. I\u2019m having so much fun,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Are you ready to go or did you want to stay?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d She swallowed hard at the tantalizing promise and hurried to the car. By the time she buckled herself in, a light mist of rain hit the windshield, which suddenly turned into a fierce storm. Edward remained quiet as he eased his way over the wet roads toward her apartment.</p><p>Her fingers fisted. Should she invite him up? Too soon? Too dangerous? Questions and scenarios flitted past her, making her wish she was more experienced with men. By the time he pulled up to the curb, nerves knotted her stomach. He shoved the gear into park. \u201cWow, it\u2019s getting rough out there. Why don\u2019t I walk you to the door?\u201d</p><p>Her instincts raced. No, inviting him up wasn\u2019t wise. She didn\u2019t know him that well. But a good make-out session in the car sounded perfect. The hammer of rain pounded around them and cloaked them in a heavy fog of darkness. \u201cNo need for you to get all wet. I\u2019ll say good-bye here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She waited. He shifted in his seat and suddenly looked uncomfortable. Carina pushed past the procession of voices screaming in her head that she wasn\u2019t good enough, sexy enough, or woman enough for Edward to want to kiss her. She closed off her natural insecurities and inched closer in the seat.</p><p>\u201cI had a really good time.\u201d Her tongue licked her lower lip. His gaze sharpened, and the tension twisted a notch. Thank God, he seemed interested. Maybe he was shy? Fine, she\u2019d make the first move. It would be good practice for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUmm, I did too.\u201d</p><p>She moved another precious inch. His brown eyes filled with a strange mixture of longing and unease. Carina closed her eyes and took the leap.</p><p>Her lips touched his.</p><p>For one awful moment, he didn\u2019t move. Her heart pounded in fear of his mixed signals, but then carefully, as if afraid to scare her, he kissed her back. Warm lips moved over hers and she relaxed under him, inviting a more intimate exploration. Her arms came up to touch his shoulders and she willed him to surrender to the embrace and hopefully take them deeper.</p> <p>He ignored her signals, kept his hands firmly in his lap, and retained a gentle, almost reverent tone to the kiss. Her heart dipped in disappointment. Slowly, she opened her lips under his and gave him full access. Skin burning for contact, heart beating, she made a low moan deep in her throat in an all-female cry for more.</p><p>Edward pulled back.</p><p>His breath came uneven. A slight touch of panic touched his expression and he gave a short laugh. \u201cWow. I\u2019m sorry, Carina, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>She jerked back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to kiss me?\u201d</p><p>His hands shot out to grasp hers in a soothing gesture. \u201cNo, you misunderstand. Of course, I wanted to kiss you. It\u2019s just that Max warned me and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMax?\u201d Every muscle stiffened. A roaring echoed in her ears and she shook her head to clear it. \u201cWhat did Max say to you?\u201d</p><p>Another laugh. \u201cNothing, really. Max just explained you\u2019re new here, and to take it slow, and that you\u2019re not ready for anything, well anything, well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex?\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hands like she scorched him. The panic was back, this time full-fledged. Carina watched her sexy make-out session wither away like a neglected plant turned into a weed. \u201cNo! I mean, of course we\u2019re not going to have sex. Hell, Max would kill me!\u201d</p><p>She rallied even though it was the Civil War all over again and she was definitely on the Southern side. \u201cMax has nothing to do with me,\u201d she stated calmly. \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend of the family, but he doesn\u2019t control what I do, and would never interfere with your job. If you\u2019re interested in me, that is.\u201d</p><p>Seconds passed. She waited. Prayed for a little gumption from this man who could be more than a first date. Longed for him to yank her back in his arms, cover her mouth with his, and declare he didn\u2019t give a shit about Max. Instead, a slight chill formed around them that had nothing to do with the sudden rain. She\u2019d lost.</p> <p>And Max won again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carina.\u201d Misery etched every feature. \u201cI love my job, and I really, really like you. But Max made it clear you need a permanent relationship and I\u2019m not ready for a commitment.\u201d</p><p>She gathered up her composure and wrapped it snugly around her. With a cool smile, Carina nodded. \u201cI understand, I really do. Thank you for a lovely evening. And don\u2019t worry about feeling awkward in the office. Let\u2019s be friends.\u201d</p><p>The word stuck in the back of her throat like a glob of peanut butter but he brightened at her statement. \u201cYes. Friends is perfect. See you Monday.\u201d</p><p>She slid out of the car and ran to her door. Fitting the key in the lock, she flipped on the lights and stepped inside. She peeked out the window and waited for Edward\u2019s car to pull away. Then without missing a beat, she grabbed her keys, and ran to her car. Her hands shook as she started the ignition and put the heat on full blast to take the chill out of the air. Water dripped in a puddle on the seat, but she ignored her discomfort. Anger burned bright and clean until there was only one goal in her mind. One thing to fix the entire ridiculous disastrous night.</p><p>Kill Maximus Gray.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Max listened to the steady beat of rain against the window while he sipped his cognac. The liquid danced on his tongue and licked with a fiery sweetness. Instead of soothing his nerves, his fingers clutched the snifter with agitation.</p> <p>She\u2019d been right.</p><p>Again.</p><p>As if sensing his disturbance, Rocky emitted a low mutter, blew out his breath, and resettled with the bulk of his body on Max\u2019s feet. The comforting warmth soothed him a bit, and he dropped his hand to pet his head\u2014a hulk of sharp bones and ugly lines that made him one of the homeliest dogs he\u2019d ever seen in his life.</p><p>The bond had been instant when he caught sight of the battered soul at the carnival. A small booth had been devoted to giving away free puppies, and he\u2019d passed it with his date. She\u2019d cooed and coddled the cute balls of fur, while Max remained patient and checked out the various games. He figured if he won her one of the stuffed animals, he\u2019d be in the perfect position for her gratefulness later. Not that there was any doubt, from the obvious comments she made as the night wore on. He\u2019d been planning his path of success when his gaze caught on the stout, muddy pit bull at the corner of the booth. A ragged rope was wrapped around his massive neck, too tight and literally choking his breath. The dog didn\u2019t seem to care, just measured his breath so he wouldn\u2019t pant too much, his eyes sharp with the knowledge that this was his lot and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it.</p><p>His mouth hung in a droop, and drool poured from one side of his lip. Bruises matted the sides of his body. One ear was literally half chopped off. But when the dog\u2019s eyes finally met and held with Max\u2019s, a bone-deep knowledge that Max had to own this dog pushed all other thoughts aside. He was a fighter\u2014both in and out of the ring. And he deserved more than this bullshit.</p><p>The kids running the puppy booth charged him one hundred dollars to carry him away. Probably would be used as a bait dog since his fighting-dog days were done. Max untied the rope, bent down, and told the dog they were going home. With a dignity known to the breed and unknown to the masses, Rocky picked himself off the dirty floor and followed him out of the carnival. Max lost his date but gained his best friend.</p><p>And Laura hated him.</p><p>The moment she came into his apartment and saw Rocky, she let out a girly screech that irritated him. He spent a few minutes explaining the dog was harmless, but when she shuddered and insisted he be locked up, Max made his choice. For the second time, he chose Rocky, and Laura left without a glance back.</p><p>The sad part was that he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>God, was he really like his father after all? Unable to dig deep enough to stick around and love someone the way they needed?</p><p>He remembered the day he learned the truth. Other kids had daddies, and Max always wondered why he didn\u2019t, until the day he asked his mother. She told him the story with a quiet dignity and love that made him believe it was all going to be okay. She never lied, but afterward, he\u2019d been angry at his mother for months. Because she did tell him the truth. He wished so hard she\u2019d lied\u2014told him his father was killed in the war, or left for the sacrifice of his family, or had a terrible accident, so that he could boast to his class friends.</p><p>Instead, his mother informed him his dad left after he was born. In a small traditional town, it had been the biggest gossip with more whispering than people had experienced in a long time. Going to church and sitting in the pew every Sunday was torture. Divorce was frowned upon, and his mother was the only one who broke the cardinal rule. Most of their friends and family protected them from the worst of the cruelty, and eventually, he learned to put up barriers so nothing hurt.</p><p>His mother tried to give him everything, but a longing to know why his father didn\u2019t want him haunted him for years and left an empty hole in his gut. Didn\u2019t most fathers fall madly in love with their newborn babies? What had he lacked that most men claimed? How could a new dad walk away from his family and never contact them again?</p><p>When he finally turned twenty-one, he decided to find out.</p><p>He used the Internet and his trust fund to find Samuel Maximus Gray living in London. He remembered the dingy town on the outskirts of the city. Dirty. Crowded. Low-class. His once wealthy, impeccably dressed father had eventually lost his fortune and his dignity. Max followed him to the local pub and watched as he stared at the television and drank pints. Finally, he approached him. Max remembered every detail as if the encounter rolled in slow motion.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>He stood before his father, heart pounding and sweat trickling down his armpits. The man looked so different from the young, smiling man in his mother\u2019s photos. This one was bald, with a bloated face. His blue eyes had a foggy mist over them, as if too much hard play and alcohol had taken their toll. He looked up from his Guinness and squinted in the dim light of the bar. Studied him for a long time. Max smelled peanuts, smoke, beer, and failure.</p><p>\u201cCrap, yes. I know who you are.\u201d His slight English accent clipped out the words. \u201cDon\u2019t much look like me, though.\u201d Max waited but his father just stared at him. No apology. No embarrassment. Nothing. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Max shifted his feet. \u201cI want to know why. Why did you leave?\u201d</p><p>The man shook his head and took a large gulp of his beer. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got the Goddamn money.\u201d</p><p>His father flinched. \u201cThen what do you want from me? I gave you up but made sure you\u2019d have enough to build your life.\u201d</p><p>Nausea rolled in his gut but he hung on, knowing he had to finish the encounter. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever want to stay? For my mother? For me?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes turned hard. \u201cI loved your mother but I never promised her I\u2019d stay. I didn\u2019t want a family. I did the best thing for you. Gave you enough to build your life and left you alone.\u201d</p><p>The truth cut through the air strong and true. His father had never wanted him. Never regretted leaving. Never even thought of them.</p><p>The gaping, raw wounds burned, but Max stood tall and knew they\u2019d heal. Nothing would ever hurt as bad as this again.</p><p>\u201cThanks for clearing that up, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He walked out of the pub, into the night, and never looked back.</p><p>Max contemplated the amber liquid. Why was he thinking such thoughts tonight? He rarely thought about his father and never questioned his decisions about women before. Carina knew nothing about his love life, yet she seemed to sense on a gut level what made him tick, like no other female other than his mother ever had. Max figured it was her innocence and young age that attracted him. He\u2019d always wanted a sister to protect and cherish.</p><p>So why wasn\u2019t he thinking of her as a sister anymore?</p><p>The image of her kissing Edward tormented his mental state. Surely, he\u2019d warned the man with enough force to make sure nothing serious happened. Hadn\u2019t he? Should he call Michael? Edward\u2019s cell phone? No, they\u2019d think he was pazzo. Should he drive by her apartment and confirm she was okay?</p><p>He tapped his finger against his chin and wrestled with the possibility.</p><p>Then he heard the doorbell.</p><p>Max eased his foot from Rocky\u2019s head and walked down the hallway. Who the hell was here this late on a Saturday night? Did Laura come back in this storm? He peeked through the side window and studied the lone figure on his doorstep. What the\u2014</p><p>He twisted the knob and pulled. \u201cCarina?\u201d</p><p>His mouth fell open. She trembled on the top step, her filmy dress soaked and plastered to her body. Her hair hung in ragged curls around her face and stuck to her cheeks. Shoeless, her red toenails curled in a huge puddle beneath the hem of the dress. He reached out to pull her inside, but one glance at her face paralyzed and shocked him to the core. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fury.</p><p>Her eyes spit like an ancient goddess bent on revenge. Chin tilted, mouth tight, fingers curled into fists, she panted as if she\u2019d gone ten rounds in the ring with Rocky Balboa himself.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit.</p> <p>He paused and teetered with the sanity of letting her in. With a muttered curse, he grabbed her wrist and dragged her through the door.</p><p>She pushed his hands away and glared at him as she dripped in his foyer. \u201cHow dare you interfere with my love life?\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2014of all people! You\u2014who wouldn\u2019t know a relationship if it bit him in the ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly my point, Carina.\u201d Max drew his professional, calm demeanor around him like a robe. If he remained logical and pointed out his fears, she\u2019d settle down and they\u2019d have a nice chat by the fire. First, he needed to convince her exactly why he stepped in. \u201cEdward doesn\u2019t do relationships, and I didn\u2019t want you to have regrets. Especially when you see him in the cold light of morning. You deserve more than that.\u201d</p><p>If possible, his argument seemed to enrage her further. She shimmered with pulsing waves of energy, her skin gorgeously flush. The wet fabric molded to every curve, and her hard nipples pushed against its barrier in an effort for freedom. He smothered a curse as his body responded in all primitive madness. He hardened, and dimly noticed the evidence against the thin fabric of his sweat shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to have a say in my life. No matter how far we go back!\u201d She closed the distance between them. Fisting her hands in his T-shirt, she stood on tiptoes and snarled, \u201cI deserve one night of great sex, Max. Would you deny me that? Would you deny what you give to yourself? I\u2019m not a perfect china doll placed on a shelf to be played with in careful moments. I\u2019m flesh and blood and I want messiness and passion and orgasms.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, yeah, he got it. His cock throbbed in time to her words. The scent of fresh rain, coconut and female swarmed his senses. Max fought the insanity of the moment but she battered him mercilessly.</p><p>\u201cYou scared the crap out of him, and he was afraid to touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I was right. No man is worth your time if he can\u2019t even stand up to someone who blocks what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you judge him, you arrogant ass. You\u2019re his boss, and you made him believe I was some scared little virgin afraid of a little physical contact.\u201d</p><p>She pushed at his chest. Temper wrapped around arousal and egged him on. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you are? There\u2019s nothing wrong with virginity. Do you want to give it away on the first man who tempts you?\u201d</p><p>A low growl escaped her throat. \u201cYes! I\u2019ve done plenty of things, Maximus Gray, things you wouldn\u2019t believe. And I liked them, and I want more, and if I want to screw every cute man in the whole frikkin company you\u2019re not going to stop me. You don\u2019t have the right.\u201d</p> <p>The words hung thick and heavy in the air. A challenge. The alpha in him rose to the surface, where civility and politeness faded away. She vibrated with a fiery sexual tension that verged on explosive and damn her to hell and back, he was going to be the man to turn it.</p><p>He gave her one last chance as he clung to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so you\u2019re a big girl who can make her own decisions. Fine. I\u2019ll stay out of your life even if you are making a big mistake. Go home and grow up.\u201d</p><p>He held his breath. Those dark eyes met his and some of his madness must have shown in his face. She eased back a precious inch and studied him.</p><p>Then smiled. \u201cGo to hell, Max. I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction roared through him. He dropped from the edge and fell into the pit without a regret.</p><p>He grasped her around the waist and lifted her up high against his chest. Three steps and her back slammed against the door. His erection fit between the wet notch of her thighs and emitted a shocked gasp from those plump lips. Her pupils dilated.</p><p>\u201cYou asked for it, little girl. So you got it.\u201d</p> <p>He bent his head and took her mouth with his.</p><p>In some dim corner of his mind, he always imagined if he ever kissed Carina it would be more of a spiritual experience; an initiation into tenderness and the gentle slide of lip against lip. Instead, the reality ripped through him with a savageness he never believed possible. He was going to hell and it was worth every damn moment.</p><p>Her lips fit perfectly to his, supple and soft under the bruising heat of his mouth. He braced himself for a protest, and decided this was all about teaching her a lesson. But she gave a hungry little moan, sunk her fingers into his hair, and opened herself to him.</p><p>He surged. The taste of fruity pinot lingered on her tongue along with a honeyed sweetness that was part of her core. Max couldn\u2019t be gentle if he tried. His head spun as he became drunk on her, diving in and out of that silky heat for more. This was no shy, uninitiated virgin he held. She blossomed beneath the hunger and demanded her own as she clung and opened her mouth wider, her tongue meeting each of his thrusts and challenging him to go deeper. He pressed her hard against the door and she gasped, wrapping her thighs tight around his hips and squeezing. He groaned in agony, desperate for more, and ripped down the spaghetti straps holding her soaked dress up. One breast popped out from the wet fabric, glistening wetly, her nipple stiff and the color of rubies.</p><p>His palm cupped the heavy weight and his thumb tweaked the tip.</p><p>She exploded.</p><p>Her nails dug into his scalp and her teeth bit down on his lower lip. The sheer rawness of her arousal thickened his blood and with a curse, he dipped his head and took her nipple deep into his mouth. He sucked, his tongue swirling and giving pleasure while she emitted tiny mewls, arching up for more. A wild creature burning up in his arms, he held her tight while he licked and teased, until a forceful tug at his head brought him back up.</p><p>He studied her face in the light. Swollen lips let out breathy little gasps, her dark eyes filled with a seething passion that reflected his own expression. \u201cMore.\u201d Her voice ripped out husky and broken. \u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>The tension had been building between them for days. Max didn\u2019t give a crap about honor or politeness or lessons. He dipped his head and dived again, their tongues battling for dominance. He thrust his erection fully between her thighs, the thin fabric of their clothes only cranking the fire between them hotter. The other strap came loose and both her breasts were free for his fingers. He rolled her nipples and pinched them lightly. The smell of her musky arousal hit him like a wolf in heat.</p><p>One hand left her breast and grabbed the material of her skirt, bunching it up in his hands and hiking it high on her thigh. His fingers touched trembling, damp skin. Slid across a tiny scrap of lacy thong that barely covered her. Hooked under the elastic band. And dove in.</p><p>She cried out his name and a rush of liquid met his fingers. Tight and hot, her channel squeezed him and his head burst like fireworks, barely able to hold it together. She was all fire and light; pure passion throbbed from her center and drenched his hand. He swallowed her delicious gasps and knew in that moment he had to have her. Own. Possess. Claim.</p><p>For him.</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>The insistent beep cut through the murky fog and penetrated his head. He ripped his lips from hers, breathing heavily in the sudden silence. Three rings. Four. Five.</p><p>The machine picked up. Michael\u2019s voice boomed over the speakers. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Just checking on how the party went\u2014I know it\u2019s late. Let me know how Carina did on her date. I\u2019m sure yours hasn\u2019t ended yet, my friend. Ciao.\u201d</p><p>The click echoed.</p><p>Slowly, Max removed his fingers from underneath her panties. Smoothed down her dress. Without a word, he allowed her body to slide down the door until her bare feet hit the ground. She shivered but instead of taking her in his arms like he craved, he stepped back. Emotion clogged the back of his throat and took away any words of comfort or apology.</p><p>Dio, what had he done?</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina stared up at the man she\u2019d loved her whole life and tried to fight the deep trembling in her bones. Her wet dress hung heavily on her body and wracked another shiver. Of course, she hadn\u2019t felt cold before. First anger, then the most passionate kiss she\u2019d ever had burned her body alive like a witch on a stake. The room tilted. She forced a deep breath through her nose and out her mouth, desperate to get her act together before him.</p><p>From the look of horror on his face, it seemed Maximus Gray had underestimated her. A sliver of satisfaction ran down her spine. He\u2019d felt it, too. Would probably ignore it. But for the rest of her natural life she finally knew the truth.</p><p>Kissing Max was better than any fantasy she\u2019d ever spun.</p><p>She pressed her fingers to her bruised lips. There was more passion in that kiss than anything she\u2019d experienced. He could have eaten her alive, and one more second of his fingers curving into her wet heat would\u2019ve elicited an earth-shattering orgasm. If the phone hadn\u2019t rung, she\u2019d probably be convulsing on him right now.</p><p>Heat flooded her cheeks but Carina knew this was a turning point. A test. If she freaked out, ran away, there would never be another kiss. Somehow, a door had flung open within their relationship, and he didn\u2019t know how to handle it. No way could he fake that type of attraction. Her gaze slid down to his erection. No way could he hide it, either.</p><p>She gambled and threw everything she had on the table. \u201cWow. Well, I guess that was overdue. At least we got it out of the way.\u201d</p><p>His piercing blue eyes glinted with astonishment. He seemed to struggle for words. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Carina gave a little laugh and ducked her head in mock embarrassment. \u201cGeez, Max, I mean, what did you expect? I was angry, pissed you off, and we\u2019ve always had a connection. It was just natural to test it out once. Now we can move on. Right?\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat in grief but her head knew she needed to follow the ruse to the bitter end. If he thought she believed the kiss meant something, he\u2019d be out of her life faster than a magician pulled a rabbit from the hat. She couldn\u2019t risk it. Not now.</p><p>Not when she realized she still wanted more.</p><p>His gaze shredded through her careful facade but she held firm. \u201cThis was my fault. I should have never pushed the issue. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2014I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand in the air though his words sliced like razors. \u201cNo need to apologize. We both needed to burn off some sexual tension. Let\u2019s just forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her smile glittered with brilliance. \u201cOf course. Just let this be a lesson to stay out of my personal life from now on. No more threats or bullying my dates. Got it?\u201d He flinched, but nodded. \u201cGreat, now I better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word stopped her immediately. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you drive in this storm. You\u2019ll stay here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. The rain slowed and I\u2019ll drive carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He repeated the command and shook his head as if throwing off the rest of the fog. \u201cI have a ton of guest bedrooms. I\u2019ll get you clothes. Go sit by the fire and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He disappeared down the hall. Carina shuddered and buried her face with her hands. No way could she stay here. All night? She\u2019d break, tiptoe into his room, and seduce him. Especially now that she experienced a taste. His earthy, musky scent, the rough stubble scraping across the tender peak of her breast, the silky thrust of his tongue as he claimed her mouth, the flavorful sting of cognac.</p><p>She locked up the memory. She mustn\u2019t make a mistake. Not until she was alone and able to assess the situation. Make a new plan. Right now, she needed him to feel as comfortable and unthreatened as possible.</p><p>Carina moved to the living room and sat on the thick cream carpet in front of the fire. Her flesh warmed from the heat of the flames, and she deliberately relaxed her muscles in an effort to slow down her heartbeat. Rocky slunk back into the living room and plopped down beside her. Murmuring soothing words of how beautiful he was, she stroked his damaged ear and sent him to doggy heaven when her fingers found his canine sweet spot.</p> <p>Carina admitted she was quite jealous.</p><p>\u201cPut these on.\u201d Max thrust a large T-shirt, sweat socks, and a flannel robe at her. Rocky kicked out his legs and growled in protest. She laughed, scratched his belly one last time, and went to change.</p><p>Her gaze took in the elegant lines of his mansion. Like Michael, he\u2019d earned a fortune building La Dolce Maggie, and his style proved both expensive and tasteful. The rooms screamed single male, from the spartan decor to the fully stocked bar and game room. The televisions were theater sized, and comfortable leather sofas and recliners, complete with beer cup holders, framed the action. One peek in his kitchen showed pristine ceramic tile, cherry cabinets, and sleek stainless steel appliances. Not a dish in the sink. Either he had a cook, a maid, or ate out every night.</p><p>She changed quickly and rejoined him in the living room, sitting in her previous spot. The wood crackled and she pulled her feet up, tucked the robe over her knees, and stared into the flames.</p><p>His gaze bore into her back but she remained silent, letting him speak first. Rocky padded over and with a doggy yawn, he rested his massive head in her lap.</p> <p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>His words came out with a grudging respect. She tilted her head in question and faced him. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Max sat in the leather chair with a snifter of cognac at his elbow. He studied her face as if probing for an answer. \u201cAbout Laura. She hated Rocky.\u201d</p><p>She hid a satisfied smirk. \u201cTold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw her in the parking lot terrified of a stray dog. Her true personality emerged. She\u2019s not used to children or dogs or a mess. She views only the surface so a dog like Rocky would\u2019ve freaked her out.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a strangled laugh and took a sip of his cognac. \u201cYeah, you always did have a canny instinct with people. Remember Julietta\u2019s friend in high school? You called her out immediately.\u201d</p><p>The memory hit her and she smiled. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that. I knew she was only pretending to be Julietta\u2019s friend to get close to Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael was happy. She was hot.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, please. You thought any female who walked on two legs was hot. Discretion wasn\u2019t one of your assets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. Damn, Julietta was pissed off, though. Refused to let Michael date her as just punishment so they both suffered.\u201d</p><p>Carina sighed and dropped her chin on her knees. \u201cJulietta wasn\u2019t used to people using her. I became so skilled, I learned how to spot deceit a mile away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would want to lie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid boys. Every time a boy in school liked me and asked me out, I discovered he only wanted to get to Venezia or Julietta.\u201d She forced a laugh but the memory still stung, to know how she was always ranked third best. To realize her personality was a big bore compared to quirkiness, sexiness, or razor-sharp intelligence. To be reminded time after time she couldn\u2019t trust the simple question of a man asking her out, because she always suspected of being used. But no longer. She\u2019d worked hard to build up her confidence and become the woman she always wanted to be. Carina shrugged it off. \u201cComes with the territory. Part of having two gorgeous older sisters, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeems to me you\u2019re a long way from that little girl who didn\u2019t believe in herself.\u201d</p><p>His comment startled her. She snuggled deeper into the comfy plaid robe. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why coming to America has been so important. It\u2019s not just about working for La Dolce Maggie\u2014it\u2019s about having the freedom to find out who I am.\u201d The fire flickered and warmed her as well as the light in Max\u2019s eyes. Like he understood. Like he\u2019d been there. \u201cIf I tried to go in a new direction, my family was always there ready to yank me back from disaster. I wasn\u2019t able to make my own mistakes. My dates were scrutinized, my studies were mandatory, and I think I lost my way. This is my opportunity to grow and experience the world on my terms. I wake up in my own apartment with no one to please but myself. I earn my own money, pay my own rent, and don\u2019t apologize or have to make excuses.\u201d</p><p>Max winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carina. Bergamo is our home, but I know what it feels like to be pigeonholed. Hard to try anything new without the whole town coming down in judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d A smile curved her lips. \u201cI remember when my girlfriend and I snuck into one of those underground clubs. We wanted to get drunk and flirt with cute boys, have some fun. The moment we ordered our drinks, Father Richard spotted me and told the bartender I was underage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was out of uniform, and I guess he\u2019s a pretty good dancer. I never looked at him the same again, and Mama skinned my hide big-time when she found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. No way to be bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one to be bad with.\u201d</p><p>The tension twisted between them. Rocky moaned as if he caught the undercurrent and lifted his head. The kiss hung in the air like a hooker at the Queen\u2019s table. Totally in your face and nowhere to subtly hide.</p><p>Suddenly, the emotions of the night crashed upon her. A draining weariness took hold of her body, and tears burned her lids. So stupid. She needed to get out of here before her entire plan crumbled and Max realized she was just a big baby.</p><p>She rose to her feet and tightened the robe around her. Her voice came out husky but she avoided his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019m exhausted. Which bedroom should I use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTop of the stairs. First one on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She moved past him, breath held, but he made no move to stop her. When her foot hit the first step his words drifted to her ears in a caress. \u201cThose men were assholes, Carina. You were always gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. Clenched the railing. And refused to answer.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina studied the canvas in front of her and fought the need to hurl something at the nearest wall.</p><p>She was officially physically and creatively frustrated.</p><p>Her teeth chewed on her lower lip. It had taken her years to finally control her famous emotions. From tantrums to crying jags, she\u2019d always felt things more deeply than the rest of her family. Now, she was proud of her restraint and ability to engage without the force field of drama around her. Unfortunately, some of the loss of emotion escaped from her painting, and she needed to find a way to get back in touch with her artistic diva.</p><p>Muttering under her breath, she opened up the windows to let some fresh air circulate and pumped up the volume of Usher. The grindy, sexy tempo urged her to explore something deeper in her art, but she wasn\u2019t sure what. At least, not yet. Her usual portraits seemed blas\u00e9, and she had no interest in landscapes.</p><p>She let her thoughts float as she attacked the white space with some blinding color. It was funny how, even as frustrated as she was now, there was a sense of satisfaction never present when she was in the office. For so long, she\u2019d worked toward one goal: dazzle her family with her business skills, make them take notice, ultimately securing her own place in the company. Her ease with accounting only made it easier to continue on the path, and though she enjoyed the people at La Dolce Maggie and the many aspects of the business world, most of it remained flat.</p><p>Her dream of a career in the art world caused her family and friends to pat her on the head and encourage her hobby. Gut instinct told her it could be more than that with a little work, but she never had the confidence to buck the system. It seemed so much easier to finish her master\u2019s and settle.</p><p>Gloominess settled over her like Pooh\u2019s rain cloud. If she didn\u2019t toughen up, Michael would give up on her and she\u2019d disappoint her family. She tried so hard to be firm, but when she heard the tender stories from people, her mushy heart betrayed her. She knew her assets well: figures and her motivation to work hard. Yet it seemed many of the qualities revered in being a good person rarely were appreciated in the business world.</p><p>Max ruled La Dolce Maggie as well as her brother. Their no-nonsense resolve brooked no argument from competitors, yet they were generous and friendly to the employees. She couldn\u2019t even blame their success on being men, since Julietta was the female version of them and ruled La Dolce Famiglia with an iron fist and high heels.</p><p>The thought of spending years cooped up in a suit jacket behind a desk prickled her nerves with dread. Half of the fun came from her interactions, but most of them ended up with her covering or saving someone\u2019s ass. She didn\u2019t mind, but Max was getting suspicious. Soon it may come to light that her management skills kind of sucked.</p><p>Max.</p><p>The memory of their kiss jolted her like an amusement park ride. God, it had been so hot. That forceful tongue, the way he took control of the kiss, the way he pushed up her dress and challenged her with his stare to stop him. It was everything she\u2019d dreamed of in a sexual encounter, and of course, it had to be with the man she was done with.</p><p>Fate had a terrible sense of humor.</p><p>She added fuchsia and kept the lines bold as she painted freestyle to relax. Not that he\u2019d mentioned the kiss or even acknowledged the evening. One week had passed and he avoided being alone with her at all costs. Her lips curved at the thought. Big, bad Maximus Gray, scared to spend too much time with innocent me.</p><p>Damned if she hadn\u2019t given him something to think about also. There was no way she imagined that type of explosive chemistry. His erection proved his interest, but he was probably terrified Michael would kill him for taking his sister for a test drive. Coward.</p><p>The idea exploded through her head. The brush paused midair.</p><p>A one-night stand.</p><p>The image of a naked Max thrusting her to orgasm made her clench her thighs together. Why not? She had no interest in him long term, and planned to find her own man. But perhaps one night of releasing their sexual tension could help both of them. She\u2019d be free of that silly worship she held as a girl and be able to experience her fantasy. Michael never had to know, and she\u2019d convince Max it was just for one night. No recriminations or future or questions.</p><p>She was also much more realistic. No, she\u2019d ripped off the blinders and planned like the woman she now was. Just one perfect, orgasm-filled night with Max and she\u2019d be able to walk away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She threw her head back and laughed at the possibility.</p><p>Oh, yeah. This could be fun.</p><p>Carina went back to her work with a new focus and began to plan.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>Max punched the button on the intercom. \u201cCan you get Carina in here for me, please?\u201d He shrugged off his jacket and hung it on the back of the chair. His skin itched. Probably from his rising temper.</p><p>She\u2019d done it again.</p><p>The last week twisted into an unruly chain of events that pounded his temples in pain. Ever since that night he\u2019d lost control and kissed her, his karma turned bad. Very bad. Maybe he deserved it.</p><p>He took a sip of lukewarm coffee and tried to wrap his brain around his options.</p><p>Her training started off so well. She worked tirelessly, was great at accounting, but the bottom line worried him. She sucked at management. Overall, she kind of sucked in the business world for one lousy reason.</p> <p>Her heart.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t have a ruthless bone in her body. No matter how hard she tried to buckle down and tackle the odds and ends of running a chain of bakeries, she couldn\u2019t seem to connect with the coldness her sister Julietta was able to connect with. When employees called out sick, she sent get-well cards and checked on them. The sales team took less than a week to discover she was an easy target. Max bet instead of chicken soup, they needed aspirin for hangovers.</p><p>Top-level management needed to be respected, and feared. Her groupie fans adored her upbeat personality, generosity, and ability to be a team player. Unfortunately, she covered too many asses and became the whole team.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>She hurried in with one of her trademark short skirts, and the sexy prim blouse that gave him bad dreams. Ever since his insane breakdown, he\u2019d been extra careful to keep alone time to a minimum. Not that she seemed to give their encounter a second thought. Seems their first kiss wasn\u2019t earth-shattering after all. His bruised ego mocked him daily. Did she kiss all men like that? Was he one of many now and not worth even an embarrassed blush?</p><p>\u201cYou needed me?\u201d</p> <p>She huffed a bit and leaned one hip against the edge of the desk. The three-inch stiletto heels beckoned him to go for round two, and this time make her come. Max turned quickly as his own cheeks flushed and grabbed onto the tendril of temper.</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed to keep our signature dessert secret until opening.\u201d He kept his voice hard and cold, reminding himself this was just business. \u201cWe need to build excitement and curiosity with the locals for a successful initiation. Correct?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. Brows drawn in a confused frown, her toe tapped on the floor to an unknown rhythm. \u201cOf course I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did I receive a call that Pete\u2019s Bread Shop is now selling one of our pastries?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPolenta e Osci.\u201d The moist yellow cake resembled the texture of polenta, but held a hazelnut cream filling, balanced with a dollop of apricot and elaborately chiseled chocolate birds perched on top. A staple in Bergamo, many American bakeries stayed away from the true Italian classics and stuck with the basics, which made this addition unique.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Carina shook her head. \u201cI spoke with Pete myself a few days ago when we went to the site. He doesn\u2019t have the talent to make that dessert, or the proper pastry chef.\u201d</p><p>Bingo.</p> <p>Max drilled her with his gaze. \u201cYou spoke with our competitor?\u201d</p><p>She shifted her feet. \u201cWell, yes, he approached me to introduce himself. He was quite polite and nice and wanted to welcome us to the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. Think back to your conversation. Did you tell him we were featuring that dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. He was chattering about an uncle who visited Italy and loved a certain pastry and wanted to know . . .\u201d She trailed off. A spark of pity cut through him at the sudden realization and horror on her face. \u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know the name and if we were going to serve it. Right?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I fell for his ruse. He seemed so genuine. He told me his uncle was sick and would love to taste the dessert again, and I said we\u2019d be serving it at the opening.\u201d He waited for her to duck her head, but she met his gaze head-on. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really screwed up.\u201d</p><p>With another employee, he would\u2019ve ripped them apart and let them stew for a few days. He opened his mouth but causing Carina any more stress was impossible. Her raw honesty when she made a mistake only made him ache to cross the room and hug her like in the old days.</p><p>He kept his distance and his head clear. \u201cI know.\u201d He paused and studied her face. \u201cCarina, do you like working here?\u201d</p><p>She tightened her lips. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry I messed up, but Michael\u2019s counting on me. I\u2019ll do better.\u201d</p><p>Her beautiful chocolate eyes filled with determination. The need to comfort strangled him but he kept his feet rooted to the floor. \u201cI know Michael wants you to eventually run La Dolce Maggie. You\u2019re dedicated and smart\u2014I never questioned those qualities about you, cara. But is this what you want?\u201d</p><p>The flash of doubt was quickly buried. \u201cOf course. This is what I trained for. I don\u2019t intend to let my family down.\u201d</p><p>Pride cut through him. The woman before him held more loyalty and work ethic than anyone he\u2019d known. Still, he remembered her creativity and longing to paint. Remembered her mother hanging her work in the kitchen and being surprised at her talent. \u201cYou never answered my question. Is this what you want?\u201d</p><p>She sank white teeth into the tender flesh of her lip. He remembered plunging his tongue between those ruby lips and devouring her. Max held back a groan of sheer misery. \u201cThis is all I have,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He tipped her chin up and studied her face. Why would she say something so odd? Endless choices stretched ahead of her. Michael may have hopes she\u2019d sit at the helm, but his friend would back her if she insisted on a different path. Venezia pursued a career in fashion, and Michael always boasted of her talent and individuality.</p><p>He sensed her heart had never belonged to the business industry like Julietta\u2019s. In his gut, she belonged somewhere else. He just wasn\u2019t sure where.</p><p>A quick tap on the door pulled his attention. Jim peeked his head in, earbud firmly in place. \u201cBoss, we got a problem. Michael needs you to get over to the waterfront location. There\u2019s some type of mix-up with the supplier, and the chef is freaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t a conference call handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, this one needs a hands-on approach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Tell Michael I\u2019m on my way and I\u2019ll report back to him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Jim disappeared. Max shrugged on his suit jacket and grabbed his briefcase. \u201cLet me fix this and we\u2019ll talk more later. Cover me while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He flew out the door and made a note to dig deeper later.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Two hours later, Carina worked her way through her paperwork pile as she manned Max\u2019s desk. The events of the morning still bothered her, but she decided to push through and make up for it. One screwup shouldn\u2019t make her beat herself bloody. Everyone made mistakes in the beginning\u2014isn\u2019t that what Max and Michael consistently told her?</p><p>She flexed her neck back and forth and tried to concentrate on the endless array of numbers filling up the computer screen. The phone buzzed.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The secretary\u2019s voice came over the phone. \u201cRobin is here to see Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Robin\u2019s Organics?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>\u201cYes, he says it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him in, please.\u201d</p><p>The man who entered had shaggy chestnut hair, muddy brown eyes, and ruddy cheeks. He wore a red shirt with ROBIN RULES scrawled across the front, and jeans with a hole in them. Not the typical business-suited executive from one of their most important suppliers. Definitely a man who got his hands in the muck. She rose and shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Carina Conte. Max isn\u2019t here at the moment. May I help you?\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his eye twitched. \u201cI have to discuss a problem with you, Ms. Conte. I hope you can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina. And I\u2019ll certainly try. Let me pull up your account with us.\u201d She tapped a few keys and read over the history and current notes. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked with us a while now, since La Dolce Maggie opened. Am I correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ve always held a solid reputation for the best organic fruit in the Hudson Valley. But we\u2019ve been having problems with the Newburgh location. The figs and raspberries were delivered late. The chef told me this morning he\u2019s dumping our account.\u201d</p><p>Carina frowned. \u201cThe chef doesn\u2019t have the final say in that\u2014we do. Is this a first occurrence?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cNo. It\u2019s happened a few times over the last month.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in her chair and studied him. Tapped her pencil against the edge of the desk. \u201cWhen suppliers run late, we can\u2019t make our pastries. That\u2019s a serious problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry. I wanted to come in person and tell you what\u2019s going on.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cMy son has been driving the truck and I started him in the business. He did well for a while, he just graduated college, but lately he got involved in the wrong crowd and\u2014\u201d Robin broke off, then pushed on. \u201cHe\u2019s been on drugs. Stealing money. Not doing the deliveries. I assumed everything was fine and never checked.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened with sympathy. She longed to reach out and take the poor man\u2019s hand, who was obviously hurting over his son. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe checked into rehab. He won\u2019t work for me again, I promise you. I\u2019m asking to give me a pass on this and let me continue with the Newburgh location. My company has a solid reputation and I don\u2019t want to lose La Dolce Maggie as an account.\u201d</p><p>Carina skimmed the reports and noted the history with Robin\u2019s Organics. No real problems until a few weeks ago. As the man waited for her decision, she dimly noted what Max and Julietta would do in this situation. They\u2019d be empathetic but professional. Probably ask for a discount for the mistakes. Most definitely make their displeasure known. But she wasn\u2019t either of them, and her gut told her Robin had been put through enough without her busting his balls.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to guarantee my chef there that he will encounter no more late deliveries. Can you promise me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve already hired someone new that I can completely trust. There will be no further mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. I will take care of this, and we\u2019ll start with a clean slate.\u201d</p><p>Relief flickered over his face. His eye gave a final twitch as he rose to shake her hand. \u201cThank you, Carina. I really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Good luck with your son. I know your heart is probably broken, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do everything possible to make sure he comes out okay. Having family to count on is half the battle.\u201d</p><p>He nodded jerkily and left the office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed, her heart aching for the man. Bringing children into the world was such a risk of love. She gave him credit for his courage and honesty.</p><p>Another hour passed as she updated spreadsheets and waited for Max.</p><p>He strode into the office, obviously in a temper. Not that his smooth looks betrayed a hair out of place or a wrinkle in his pressed iron-gray suit. His purple tie was perfectly knotted and never askew. But his features were tight with displeasure, and his eyes snapped blue fire as he dumped his briefcase on the desk.</p><p>\u201cWe have big problems. I need a meeting with Robin\u2019s Organics.\u201d</p> <p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Carina rose from his chair, walked in front of the desk, and leaned against it. She kept her voice smooth and controlled. \u201cRobin already came to see me.\u201d</p><p>Max jerked his head up. \u201cWhat are you talking about? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came while you were at the waterfront. He\u2019s been late with his deliveries over the past weeks and he was afraid he\u2019d lose our account. I had a long talk with him and we fixed it. There should be no further issues.\u201d</p><p>A muscle worked in his jaw. The musky scent of his aftershave hit her. \u201cI just listened to an endless tirade from our pastry chef who insisted I dump this account. What was his excuse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis son has been giving him problems and they\u2019re short-staffed.\u201d</p><p>Max lifted one brow in scorn. \u201cHow is that my problem? Did you threaten him? Get us a discounted price for his screwups?\u201d</p><p>Temper bit her nerves. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that was necessary, Max. He\u2019s been working for us for years and we\u2019ve never had previous problems. We all go through personal problems, and relationships in business are the foundation. Giving him a lecture or insisting we get a deal wasn\u2019t the right move this time.\u201d</p><p>His fuse was getting shorter. He cursed and raked his fingers through his hair. Carina hated the way the waves just fell back in perfect form. Was he even human? How can such a living, breathing Sex God be created in such form? The memory of his hands lifting her up and slamming her against the wall caused tummy flutters and a throbbing wetness demanding satisfaction. She concentrated on his hard-assed behavior instead.</p><p>\u201cRelationships are important, but suppliers respect strength. If you let him get away with this once, he\u2019ll know it can be repeated. Once again, you\u2019re being too soft. You need to man up and take the heat.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched at his condescending tone. \u201cMan up?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cThis has nothing to do with being soft\u2014it has to do with building trust. He trusts us to give him this free pass, and that inspires loyalty and a desire to never let us down again. Business 101, Max. Maybe you need to take a refresher course.\u201d</p> <p>He took a few steps until they were face-to-face. Her breath came in shallow pants and she tamped down on the swirling array of emotions ready to explode. The hell if she\u2019d lose her temper in front of him in the office. It was time he realized who he was dealing with.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to tell our chef to forget about the fig tarts for his party tonight. How about that?\u201d</p><p>She rose on tiptoes and flung her head up. \u201cMaybe you can man up and tell him we make the final decisions at La Dolce Maggie. He\u2019s a temperamental asshole and always has been.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted in a snarl. \u201cHe makes outstanding food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes up for his height issues by being mean and making ridiculous demands. You\u2019re just coddling him.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and grabbed her upper arms. His face was so close to hers she saw the wicked curve to his lower lip, the sexy stubble clinging to his jaw, and the burn in his blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m the boss, and I make the final decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad you\u2019re not making the right ones.\u201d</p><p>His breath rushed hot over her mouth. Her lips parted. Those fingers bit deep into her arms as he struggled with his temper. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a little mouthy for someone who\u2019s supposed to be in training.\u201d</p> <p>Desire slammed into her hard and fast. Her nipples pushed against the sheer silk of her blouse and begged for the naughty bite of his teeth. Her voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cSo make me shut up.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for a moment. Spit out a curse.</p><p>And slammed his mouth over hers.</p><p>The kiss was hot and fast and demanding. His tongue surged between her lips and thrust deep while he lifted her up and set her on top of the desk. She opened wider for him and clung to his shoulders. Her skirt rode up high on her thighs and she scooted toward the edge to part her legs wider. He caught her frantic motions, pushed the material up to her waist, grabbed her ankles, and wrapped them around him.</p><p>Carina fell into the kiss as an array of sensations dampened her panties and made her crazy for more. He devoured her mouth like a starving predator intent on destroying his prey whole. His hand squeezed the sensitive flesh behind her knee, then slid up toward her white lace panties. He caught her moan and nipped at her lower lip, bathing the swollen flesh with his tongue. \u201cI need to touch you,\u201d he rasped out. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. Do it now.\u201d</p><p>His fingers slipped under the elastic and slid home. She moaned and arched under the fierce plunge, digging her stiletto heels deep into his back. His thumb flicked her swollen clit and rubbed against the silky edge in a wild tease. She pulled on his hair, opened her legs farther, and slipped toward orgasm.</p><p>The intercom buzzed. \u201cMax, your two o\u2019clock is here.\u201d</p><p>His mouth ripped from hers. She fought to keep from dragging him back to finish the job, but the staggered look on his face made her release him. His fingers left her aching and empty, and the scent of her arousal clung to the air. Her breath came ragged and uneven as she slid off the desk, pulled down her skirt and smoothed back her blouse. Then faced him.</p><p>\u201cChrist, what the hell am I doing? I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>The front of his pants bulged in obvious contradiction. Sick of him denying the hot-blooded attraction, she cocked her head and pointedly dropped her gaze. \u201cSeems like you meant it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it, Max. Go to your meeting. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Not able to stomach more of his apologies and guilt, she walked out of the office. Oh, yeah, it was definitely on. He\u2019d kissed her twice now, and obviously wanted more. She just needed to convince him to take the shot. Somehow, she needed to get him alone on neutral territory to finish what they started.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A few nights later, Carina set down the bold blue china on the table. Thank God it was the end of the week. Ever since her second encounter with Max, he seemed intent on proving he\u2019d made a mistake that would never be repeated. A real boost for the feminine ego, she mocked inwardly.</p><p>She turned and caught the massive shadow of black currently perched on the head chair. She crossed her arms in front of her chest and made a tsking sound.</p><p>\u201cDante, you know the rules. Off the chair.\u201d The monster cat gave her a bored look and licked his paw. She used the tone animals always responded to. \u201cI mean it. Off. Now.\u201d</p><p>Dante flicked his tail, lifted his head, and gave a warning hiss.</p><p>Maggie\u2019s voice cut through the room. \u201cDante, lose the attitude.\u201d The cat lifted his head and jumped down. With a disgusted glance, he headed toward Maggie for a quick rub against her leg and a purr.</p><p>Carina blew out a breath. \u201cHow do you do that? He is the most disagreeable, stubborn, pain-in-the-ass cat in the world. He\u2019s the only animal who doesn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Maggie grinned. \u201cYeah, I know. Isn\u2019t he great?\u201d</p><p>Friday night dinners were a new staple in Carina\u2019s life, and she looked forward to them. Hosted one week at Alexa and Nick\u2019s, the next week at Michael and Maggie\u2019s, she\u2019d gotten used to relaxing in a homey environment away from the office.</p><p>Carina slid onto the breakfast stool and worked on the salad. Her sister-in-law tried not to bump into the counter with her belly, and Carina gave her credit. The trendy red skirt and casual scoop-necked tee made her look chic and maternity fashionable. Maggie checked on the garlic bread and sipped a glass of sparkling seltzer. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on in your dating life. How was your last date? Edward, right?\u201d</p><p>Carina hid a wince and added a handful of olives. \u201cUmm, that didn\u2019t go very well. Nothing bad, just flat between us.\u201d</p><p>Maggie wrinkled her nose. \u201cNo chemistry sucks. I can\u2019t tell you how many dates I went on where I felt nothing. Zippo. Any other prospects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the work pool, I\u2019m not sure where else to meet men. What did you do when you were single?\u201d</p><p>Maggie laughed. \u201cToo many bad things, which is exactly what you need to do. I\u2019ll give you a list of some clubs that you can hit on the weekends. I\u2019d go with you for moral support, but you\u2019ll never get picked up with a prego next to you.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou\u2019d probably get picked up before me, woman. You still look hot.\u201d</p><p>Her sister-in-law flushed with gratitude. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Maggie, you have this sex appeal I always wanted. How do you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your man.\u201d</p><p>Maggie hooted with laughter and threw the pan of toasty bread on the counter. \u201cCarina, you already have everything you need in that killer body of yours. Just remember this\u2014men like women who go after what they want. If a man attracts you, connect with your inner vixen and let loose. He won\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, no. I know.\u201d</p><p>The thought of being the seductress for a change turned her on. Why not step up the initiative and go after what she wanted?</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you need to go out dancing and have some fun. Plenty of men will be there to practice on. All those ridiculous suggestions to meet men in bookstores and church piss me off.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s church comment echoed through her mind, and she bit her lip to keep from giggling. \u201cOr the grocery store. Honestly, when has a man ever come up to you and asked you to feel his bread to see if it was fresh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the gym! Yeah, nothing hotter than a smelly woman with makeup sliding off her face and shaking muscles. Can you see us responding to the comment, \u2018How much did you lift today baby?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m still not ready for the Internet. Not unless I get desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave that for the big guns. Alexa will have too much fun posting your profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that.\u201d Alexa\u2019s voice sang out from the hallway.</p><p>The doorbell rang and the mutter of low voices echoed through the corridor. \u201cOh, that\u2019s finally Max. Can you get it, Michael?\u201d she screamed out.</p><p>Still laughing from her talk with Maggie, it was a while before she noticed the feminine drawl. Curious, she peeked her head around the wall.</p><p>Crap. He\u2019d brought a date.</p><p>She watched as her future one-night stand entered the mansion with a woman on his arm. Not just any woman. Max only dated the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me, and this one stunk of royalty and privilege. Red hair curled like an art form around her shoulders, and her emaciated figure screamed size four. Slanted green eyes held a sleepy look that oozed sex. French manicured nails and stiletto heels warned women to stay away from her man. And her man tonight was Max. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carina tried not to glower as she hid in the entryway to the kitchen and spied. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, sweetie?\u201d Maggie asked. \u201cYou look pissed.\u201d</p><p>She cleared away her cranky expression and forced a smile. \u201cNo, just checking out Max\u2019s flavor of the week. This one looks serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t think he was bringing a date tonight.\u201d Maggie stuck her head out of the kitchen and watched as the men chatted and Max made the introductions. \u201cOh, that\u2019s Victoria Windsor. Her daddy is duke of something, so she\u2019s some type of royalty. Max had a few dates with her before. She must be back in town.\u201d</p><p>Carina blinked. Her hatred swarmed to monstrous proportions. \u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>Her sister-in-law sharpened her gaze and her claws. \u201cWant me to get rid of her? Just say the word and I\u2019ll blame the madness on pregnancy hormones.\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped her lips. \u201cNo, of course not. I told you I\u2019m completely over Max.\u201d</p><p>A snort hung in the air. \u201cYeah, and next I\u2019ll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I buy a bridge?\u201d</p><p>Maggie waved her hand. \u201cNever mind. I keep forgetting about our ridiculous American expressions.\u201d She lifted the salad off the counter and carried it to the dining room. The huge open space held an oversized cherrywood table, with fashionable leather seats, and a matching china cabinet. The crystal gleamed underneath a dripping chandelier, and Maggie grabbed a few bottles of wine from the full bar in the corner. The formality was softened by the array of candles, dim lighting, and gorgeous watercolors of Tuscan landscapes adorning the walls. Fresh flowers made up the centerpiece. Feminine touches were scattered throughout her brother\u2019s once bachelor mansion, and Carina loved the contrast of soft and hard, simplicity and lushness, that now shimmered through the house.</p> <p>Alexa waddled in and groaned. \u201cI want wine so bad I can taste it. You guys better bring me a bottle when you visit at the hospital. Who\u2019s that with Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems to be the question of the evening,\u201d Maggie drawled. \u201cName is Victoria, Max\u2019s current date.\u201d</p><p>Alexa shuddered. \u201cShe\u2019s too skinny. I don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction pulsed through her system at the declaration. Anyone who didn\u2019t eat was suspect in the family. Maggie shrugged. \u201cI met her once before though and she\u2019s actually nice. Maybe it\u2019s a sign.\u201d</p><p>Carina gritted her teeth. Damn, if she\u2019d known she\u2019d be competing with a frikkin princess she would have at least worn a dress. She\u2019d donned a pair of casual jeans, white tank, and Keds. Knowing she looked about twelve, she cursed her stupidity. Women who wanted to seduce men like Max needed to bring up their game. Round one to the bitch.</p><p>The clatter of heels echoed and Max appeared in the dining room. He made the introductions again, and nodded at her as if they never had their tongues down each other\u2019s mouths. \u201cCarina, this is Victoria. Carina is a close family friend.\u201d</p> <p>She cocked her head. \u201cYep. Real close. Nice to meet you, Vicky.\u201d</p><p>The woman winced at the nickname, but Carina gave her credit when she nodded. \u201cLovely to meet Max\u2019s family. The last time I was in town it was too brief, and we only did formal parties, right, darling?\u201d Bloody red nails stroked his arm. \u201cHopefully this trip will be longer.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled, but she saw the humor didn\u2019t reach his eyes. He almost seemed . . . resentful. As if trying to prove a point that there\u2019d never be anything between them. Interesting. He refused to look her straight in the eye and reminded her of the stray dogs she used to pick up who would tilt their heads to avoid full contact. To avoid the truth of their circumstances. Denial was awesome in all species.</p><p>Nick strolled in with a platter of penne alla vodka. \u201cHope everyone is hungry.\u201d Carina bit her lip as the women pointedly looked at Victoria\u2019s twig figure, but she led the charge and rubbed her hands together.</p><p>\u201cBring on the carbs, boys.\u201d Maggie and Alexa grinned and they sat at the table. Carina\u2019s gut told her there was a damn good reason Max brought her to dinner, and she was about to find out. \u201cSo, Victoria, what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly charity work at this point. I graduated from Oxford with a law degree, but found practicing wasn\u2019t as satisfying as helping. I cofounded a children\u2019s orphanage in London.\u201d</p><p>Max straightened up in his chair as if about to make a presentation. \u201cVictoria is both educated and street savvy. Her foundation helps hundreds of teens with nowhere left to go. Once they hit a level in the system, foster care can no longer help.\u201d</p><p>Alexa nodded. \u201cYeah, like that Batman movie. The Dark Knight Rises, remember, Nick? The Bruce Wayne Foundation explained that problem. Quite impressive.\u201d</p> <p>Nick laughed at his wife\u2019s ability to relate everything to books, movies, or poetry.</p><p>Victoria ducked her head and said to Max, \u201cDarling, you flatter me. I had a safety cushion behind me. You worked your way up to the top, so you deserve all the kudos.\u201d</p><p>Carina wondered if she\u2019d get a cavity from all the sweetness between them. Yet, he never touched her. Max was always affectionate, especially toward someone he had feelings for. How many times had she watched him pet and fondle his escorts? But he kept his distance as if he dined with royalty rather than family. Hands flat on the table. Respect and admiration in his eyes but no sign of lust to tumble her. Hmm, interesting.</p><p>Victoria chatted a bit about her charity and made no move to touch him, either. They seemed more like companions than lovers. The spark of sexual attraction lay flat without even a twitch of interest between them. Any woman who didn\u2019t want to dive into bed with Max had something else going on. Frigidity? Carina put on her Nancy Drew hat and swore to figure it out.</p><p>Maggie turned the conversation toward Alexa. \u201cSo, have you guys figured out a name yet for the babe?\u201d</p><p>Nick nodded. \u201cIf it\u2019s a girl, we\u2019re going with Maria for Alexa\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>Carina sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s so lovely. What about a boy?\u201d</p><p>Nick shot his wife a warning look. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on that.\u201d</p><p>Alexa straightened up and plowed on. \u201cIf it\u2019s a boy, we\u2019re naming him Johan.\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed his forehead. A short silence fell. Maggie finally broke the polite pause. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, why? Where the heck did you get that name from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess,\u201d Nick said. \u201cYou know her better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>Carina watched her sister-in-law sift through possibilities until she gasped. \u201cAre you nuts? Oh, my God, you\u2019re trying to name him after Johan Santana!\u201d</p><p>Alexa pressed her lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely name and has nothing to do with the Mets.\u201d</p><p>Maggie let out a hysterical laugh and wiped at her eyes. \u201cBullshit. Santana pitched the first no-hitter in Mets history and you\u2019re trying to re-create glory. I remember that frikkin night. You cried so hard I thought you\u2019d go into labor.\u201d</p><p>Carina remembered hearing about Alexa\u2019s obsession with the New York Mets baseball team, and also the resentment toward Nick\u2019s team, the New York Yankees. Thank God she wasn\u2019t a sports fan. Seemed more stress than she needed, especially from the glare on Alexa\u2019s face toward her best friend.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Maggie. It was a beautiful moment to appreciate. Our son should be proud to have that name.\u201d</p><p>Nick snorted and refilled his wineglass. \u201cOver my dead body,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSantana\u2019s gone downhill since and hasn\u2019t pitched a decent game in his last five starts. How about Derek for a name?\u201d</p><p>Alexa slammed down her fork. \u201cAbsolutely not! No son of mine will be named after Derek Jeter, you\u2014you\u2014Yankee-lover!\u201d</p><p>Nick sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later, sweetheart. Did you try the calamari? I outdid myself this time.\u201d</p><p>Alexa grumbled but went back to her meal, and Carina tried hard not to laugh at the absurd conversations the couple engaged in.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a project going on in New York, or did you come to visit Max?\u201d Michael asked Victoria.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s here for business and I thought I\u2019d accompany him. I\u2019d love to see a play or the opera if I can get Maxie to take some time off.\u201d The nickname caused a few twitters around the table. \u201cPoor thing has been working so hard on the new opening. Maybe I can con him into taking some time off this week if I get his boss\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, as long as everything\u2019s going smoothly he can take a few off. Carina can cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to work with a close family friend?\u201d Her smile was genuine beneath gleaming white teeth, and guilt nipped at Carina. How dare she judge people on surfaces? Victoria seemed like a nice, savvy woman who just happened to have the appearance of a supermodel. Was that her fault? No. She decided to back off. If Max wanted to pursue her, maybe it was for the best. His constant need to date women who were wrong for him fascinated her, and he seemed intent on proving he\u2019d changed.</p><p>Victoria chattered on about a friend of hers she was worried about. \u201cRichard\u2019s been my rock for years now. Our fathers are best friends, and we grew up together. Poor man is going through a tragic divorce right now. Married the wrong woman. I\u2019m doing everything possible to try and get him through it.\u201d</p><p>Maggie and Alexa made sympathetic noises.</p><p>Carina caught the raw longing on the woman\u2019s face as she uttered the name. Richard.</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d she said, forking up a piece of pasta. \u201cHe\u2019s very lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>A twinge of regret gleamed from Victoria\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes. I keep telling him that.\u201d</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>Victoria was in love with Richard and the idiot male probably didn\u2019t even know it. No wonder she was trying desperately to make it work with Max. Max never demanded much from his dates. Maybe there was pressure for her to settle down? Or did she want to try to make this Richard jealous? Empathy pulsed in her gut. Victoria struggled with the same damn situation Carina had. Mooning over a man who looked at her like a younger sister. Pathetic. Well, the least she could do was cut her loose from Max and save her from making a tragic mistake.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lily?\u201d Max asked as he spooned a few bits of salad onto his date\u2019s plate, then was told to stop. A black olive rolled off the side and onto the table. Victoria made no move to spear it with the fork. The woman\u2019s lack of food appreciation saddened Carina.</p><p>\u201cSleeping at Nonni\u2019s house. They spoil her rotten and Nick thought we\u2019d try to have a grown-up night.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled on a corkscrew curl and winked at his wife. \u201cYeah, maybe we\u2019ll both make it past ten tonight. Dare to dream.\u201d</p><p>Carina chuckled. \u201cParenthood changes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Michael piped up. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need to enjoy yourself when you\u2019re single. Max and Carina are in the twilight of their lives.\u201d He winced when Maggie treated him to her powerful right hook on his arm. \u201cKidding, cara. You tortured me enough before we got married. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing, but must admit that life seems just about perfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded and he lifted a hand to press a kiss against her palm.</p><p>Raw need rose up and choked Carina. She stuffed her mouth full of pasta instead and hoped it would feed at least her physical hunger. Victoria tapped her fork thoughtfully against her Botoxed lips. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to have children,\u201d she announced. \u201cI\u2019m exhausted from the endless dating and partying. Don\u2019t you agree, Max?\u201d</p><p>A flush crept to his cheeks as everyone stared. Carina held her breath. \u201cSure.\u201d She seemed as if waiting for him to expand. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to settling down in the future.\u201d</p><p>Victoria cocked her head. \u201cFuture? What does that mean? How far into the future? You know Daddy needs me to marry soon, right?\u201d</p> <p>Alexa and Maggie put down their utensils. Even Nick and Michael leaned forward to catch his answer.</p><p>Max cleared his throat and reached for his wine. He took a sip but the silence still pulsed around the table. Like a trapped wolf, his gaze scurried in panic around the table, then locked with hers.</p><p>Pure heat blazed from blue eyes and stung. The truth hit her full force. He wanted Victoria to be The One. But she wasn\u2019t. He also had no clue she was in love with another man. Perhaps he sensed her obvious distance and decided she\u2019d be another safe bet.</p><p>Slowly, Carina relaxed and began to enjoy the show. \u201cMax adores children,\u201d she said. \u201cHis mother has been wanting him to settle down for a while now. But where would you guys live?\u201d</p><p>A strange sound emitted from his throat then died.</p> <p>Victoria jumped in. \u201cOh, we could work that out. I need to be in England for a few months of the year, but the rest of the time we can be in New York. Of course, we\u2019d visit Italy so I could meet Max\u2019s mother. Doesn\u2019t that sound wonderful, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. One day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Carina tamped down on a giggle. She\u2019d finally seen a full fledged-male panic attack. \u201cSoon.\u201d Max grabbed a napkin, wiped his mouth, and rose from the table. \u201cUmm, excuse me for a minute. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>He launched himself down the hall and disappeared. Victoria drew back in surprise.</p><p>Carina rose from the table. \u201cIf you\u2019d excuse me for a second, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>She followed.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Max closed the door to the house\u2019s library. What was wrong with him?</p><p>He fisted his hands and pressed them against his eyes. Victoria was the perfect woman. She was beautiful, smart, and wanted to settle down and raise a family. He always enjoyed her company when she came to town. Proving Carina wrong was important. Her words mocked and danced in his head like an evil joker gone wild.</p><p>You always pick the wrong women.</p><p>Impossible. Sure, she had great examples, but Victoria finally proved her wrong. So why was there no real connection or any desire to take the relationship to next level?</p><p>The image of his fingers diving into wet fire shimmered before him. The sharp pain of her heels in his back. The sweet, sassy taste of her mouth and the smell of her arousal. Pushing that postage stamp skirt up her thighs had been the sweetest fantasy come true. If they hadn\u2019t been interrupted, he would\u2019ve laid her back on the desk and dived in.</p><p>Jesus, one time could be forgiven. Barely. Twice?</p> <p>He needed his own carved slot in hell.</p><p>A light tap at the door was his only warning.</p><p>His nose twitched as the clean scent of cucumber and melon rose in the air. Awareness prickled down his spine. The relaxed, scholarly air of the library suddenly crackled with electricity. The soft soles of her Keds masked her progress, but her body heat burned right behind him. Damn her for screwing up his head.</p><p>Damn her for making him want.</p><p>He turned around to face her. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he said. \u201cJust needed a minute.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer. He stepped back. A touch of a smile curved her lips. \u201cWas it the marriage or the kids that freaked you out?\u201d</p><p>He bucked up and took her jab like a man. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Max expected a sarcastic comment but she nodded as if she understood. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms in front of his chest. \u201cGo ahead. Aren\u2019t you going to tear her apart?\u201d</p><p>She had the nerve to look surprised. \u201cWhy? If you like her, I\u2019m happy for you. She actually seems kind of nice, once I got over her food limitations.\u201d</p><p>Her ease with him dating other women after that kiss mocked him. Why did he want to drag her against him and prove it meant something? \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to find anything wrong with her. I already checked\u2014she loves animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe believes in charity. Can run a business. Has a solid family foundation. I\u2019m telling you, she\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her lips actually twitched. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled for you. Here\u2019s hoping you commit and settle down. Better you than me. I\u2019m looking forward to some fun. Hot sex now. Babies later.\u201d</p><p>He stretched to full attention. Her pouty lips poured the words out like honey. Hot. Sex. Anger balled in his gut and curdled. \u201cStop saying crap like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Can\u2019t make you any more uncomfortable than what happened a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. Because he wanted to do it again so bad he told her the opposite. \u201cThat was a mistake.\u201d His voice came out strangled. \u201cBoth times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>Her thoughtful words twisted his gut. How did a woman in Keds suddenly control the situation? Her mind and body pummeled his will full force. He grabbed for the ultimate excuse. \u201cAnything physical between us would be a complete betrayal of trust. Wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The old Carina would have blushed and stammered. Looked at him like he was God and skittered away. The new Carina closed the distance and tipped her chin up. All five feet shimmered with feminine power. \u201cWould it?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His dick strained the fabric of his pants in disagreement. With all the blood leaving his head, it took him a second or two to respond. \u201cYes. It would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play games, Carina. We can\u2019t sleep together. The night I kissed you was a horrible mistake. So was the episode in the office. I still feel guilty about it.\u201d</p><p>Those dark eyes simmered with mystery and secrets he\u2019d kill to reveal. Her tongue snuck out and licked her lower lip. Amusement played over her face. \u201cSorry to kill your illusions, Maxie. But I\u2019m just looking for a bad man to play with.\u201d</p><p>Her innocent white shirt and ridiculous sneakers only made him want to rip off the fabric to reveal her siren curves. The taste of her haunted him. And as if she knew, she leaned in, and her breath whispered across his lips in a teasing caress. \u201cWanna play?\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. The blood rushed to his dick and filled his head with a roaring sound. He was an experienced man well versed in the art of seduction. But this powerhouse knocked him out and left his head swimming. His head screamed Hell, yes.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d The word stuck in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m dating Victoria.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she pulled back. Her shoulders lifted. \u201cUnderstood. I\u2019ll respect your new relationship and won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d She walked to the door, and her hips swung in a graceful dance. The luscious curve of her buttocks winked good-bye. \u201cJust one more thing. Something you should probably know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you stay close to Richard.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cRichard is one of her friends. There\u2019s nothing going on between them. He\u2019s dealing with a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in love with him. Always has been. Always will be. Ask her.\u201d She winked. \u201cSee you out there.\u201d</p><p>Max stood rooted to the floor and wondered when his life had gone completely to Hades.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cI need you in Vegas. Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Max groaned, tossed his cold cup of coffee in the trash, and pulled out his bottom drawer for the good stuff. Taking out two shot glasses, he poured grappa, handed one to Michael, and saluted.</p><p>A quick snap of the glass and the liquid went down hot and smooth. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, Michael. I\u2019ve got the opening in New Paltz next week and you want me to leave now?\u201d</p><p>Michael rubbed his fingers over his face in his trademark gesture of frustration. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my friend, I hate to do this to you. The Venetian Hotel in Vegas is interested in putting in our store, and I need someone to get my buyer to commit. Sawyer Wells is in charge now. Aren\u2019t you two friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, known him for years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I planned to make the trip myself, but Mama decided to fly in early. I can\u2019t leave this week.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Maggie can\u2019t travel at this stage and I don\u2019t want to leave her. Mama\u2019s coming in tomorrow. She wants to see Maggie with her own eyes before the birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s her health? Is she still having heart problems?\u201d</p><p>Michael shook his head. \u201cShe always needs to be watched, but Julietta says she\u2019s doing quite well. The doctor examined her and said she will have no trouble making a long flight. I need you to stay in Vegas for a few days, Max. Close the deal.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s face relaxed and he let out a deep sigh. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll handle any issues here. Oh, and I\u2019m sending Carina with you.\u201d</p><p>He shot out of the chair like his ass was on fire. \u201cWhat? Absolutely not.\u201d</p><p>His friend shot him a confused look. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He decided to pace and work off the sudden tension that pulled uncomfortably at his muscles. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready for something like this. I need to concentrate and I can\u2019t worry about watching over her.\u201d</p><p>Michael leaned back and waved a hand in the air. \u201cUnderstood. You do not have to babysit her.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry the thing with Victoria didn\u2019t work out, but I bet within a few days you\u2019ll have some lovely Vegas showgirl on your arm. Carina won\u2019t cramp your style. This is an opportunity for her to learn from the beginning how we go about signing the initial deal. She needs to see all the steps and will be there to assist you in any paperwork, errands, etc. I can send Edward with you. He is an excellent salesperson. He can help show our commitment.\u201d</p><p>The grappa came back up from his stomach and choked him. He coughed violently while his head spun. Michael got up to pound him on the back. \u201cNot Edward,\u201d he managed to gasp. \u201cI\u2019ve been having some, er, issues with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need to step in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, I have it under control. I don\u2019t need anyone else on the trip. I can handle it. We\u2019ll be fine. I can lock this up by myself. No need for a salesperson at this stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know you can.\u201d Michael placed a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThis business would never have happened without you, my friend. Thank you for always being there.\u201d</p><p>An image of Carina backed up against the door with her dress pulled down flashed before his memory. Sweat pricked his forehead. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Carina to be ready for a morning flight.\u201d He reached into his briefcase and gave him a thick file. \u201cHere is the paperwork. I\u2019ll have the jet fueled and ready by nine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the door shut behind him, Max groaned. Oh, yeah. He was definitely getting bad karma for that one moment of gut-wrenching pleasure with the only woman he couldn\u2019t have. Now he had to spend a few days in Vegas with her. Alone.</p><p>He fought down panic. Maybe he was overestimating his stock. Carina hadn\u2019t made one reference to that night since her announcement. His ego still burned at not being able to tell his Victoria lusted after another man. One he\u2019d actually met before. Even worse was the knowledge they\u2019d had no sexual chemistry. He\u2019d been desperate enough to create some, but her need to marry with her father\u2019s pressure probably stirred panic. Their long conversation was fruitful, and she finally admitted her true feelings for Richard. He kissed her on the forehead and wished her luck, hoping he\u2019d convinced her to take the leap and go after the man she loved.</p><p>As for Carina, she pretended nothing happened between them. She acted breezy. Friendly. Casual. Like they\u2019d never had each other\u2019s tongues in their mouths and he\u2019d never had his fingers around her nipple.</p><p>Stop.</p> <p>Vegas was business. She wanted to learn. There was no reason to panic over the idea of spending a few days with her.</p><p>The lure of a new deal sang in his blood. The hell with it. He loved Vegas. The heat. The adrenaline. The sin. He\u2019d be seeing his old friend, play some poker, and do what he did best. Close a deal and find a woman for a little while. Someone to take his mind off Carina and get his head back in the game.</p><p>He grabbed the file and got to work.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina tried hard not to bounce up and down in her seat like a child, but being cool was getting more difficult. The limo coasted down the streets of Vegas and her senses short-circuited. A city that lived for one reason and boasted the goal from the rooftops: pleasure. A place to lose herself, her inhibitions, and finally get Max into bed.</p> <p>Welcome to Vegas.</p><p>Max watched her with barely veiled amusement but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cCan we go see Celine Dion?\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his nose. \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCirque du Soleil?\u201d</p><p>His lip quirked. \u201cMaybe. If I\u2019m drunk enough.\u201d</p><p>She stuck out her tongue and he laughed. \u201cI refuse to let your jaded view spoil my pleasure. I dreamed of coming to Vegas and can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here. Do the showgirls really walk around practically naked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times have you been here?\u201d</p><p>He relaxed back into the seat and Carina hid her hungry stare. Dressed in a dark business suit, with gold custom cuff links, his hair neatly tamed, he\u2019d turn every woman\u2019s head, including a Vegas showgirl\u2019s. Animal-like grace trapped in civility. The bright red tie hinted at what simmered beneath the surface, and her fingers itched to rip it off in the limo, lower the smoked screen, and act out one of her naughty fantasies. Instead, she remained still and listened to his answer. \u201cA few for business. Some for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. No Elvis weddings you annulled, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and stuck her head out the window, abandoning any demeanor of sophistication. The muggy air pressed down on her and sprung her curls into frizzy disaster but she didn\u2019t care. They pulled into the Venetian Hotel and Carina laughed at the fake imagery of Italy around her. The sleek marble sculptures, numerous water fountains, and lush greenery beckoned her farther into the majestic opening doors. She expected Vegas hotels to be a bit over the top and glitzy, but there was an undertone of sheer elegance with the furnishings.</p><p>Michael stopped at the front desk. Her head bounced back and forth as she tried to take in the full power punch of the casino lobby. A giant golden sphere dominated the center of the highly polished floor, set off by soaring columns, large archways, and an elaborately painted ceiling to rival Michelangelo\u2019s Sistine Chapel. The whirling array of textures, colors, and lushness fogged her senses with pleasure.</p><p>They received their key and were ushered to the tower. Up, up, up they climbed, until the giant from \u201cJack and the Beanstalk\u201d seemed to be their neighbor. The elevator doors opened, and they keyed in their code and entered the penthouse suite.</p> <p>Carina gasped.</p><p>She knew Michael and Max were very, very rich. From humble beginnings, she watched the family empire grow until they didn\u2019t need to worry about paying bills, supporting Venezia\u2019s shoe habit, or paying off a college education. The house was revamped, but she was still sheltered in Bergamo. Her surroundings never changed, and the inner person she was remained untouched by success or money.</p><p>But looking around the suite completely bedazzled her.</p><p>The open living room boasted a slate blue sofa, recliner, and gorgeous cherrywood furnishings. Rich canvas paintings of Italian scenes decorated the earthy, rich walls, and the floor-to-ceiling window showed off the city in all its glory. She remained speechless as she walked around and took in the fully stocked wet bar, the Jacuzzi tub, and the massive king-size bed with so many pillows she longed to stretch out and take a nap right now.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to ask Michael for a raise,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Max laughed. \u201cThis is your business, cara. You\u2019re family, so you\u2019re a part of everything built, including the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable taking advantage of something I never really worked for,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI want to earn my own right to the money.\u201d</p><p>His face softened, and for a brief moment, his baby blues filled with a fierce pride. \u201cI know. You have character, which many women don\u2019t exhibit these days.\u201d</p><p>Carina snorted. \u201cPlenty of women do, Max. You just find the wrong ones every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we give my lousy track record a break today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d A flicker of guilt lit her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Victoria.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou were right. As usual. At least she\u2019s going after who she really wants.\u201d He deliberately changed the subject and pointed toward the adjoining door. \u201cI\u2019ll show you your room.\u201d</p><p>He walked over, punched in a code, and swung it open. She stepped into a matching suite with her own personal bed and bath. She let out a squeal of excitement, kicked off her shoes, and did something she\u2019d been craving since they walked in the door.</p><p>She ran full speed and launched herself on the mattress. Sinking into sheer softness, she groaned and stretched out, luxuriating in the cozy feel of the pillows and blanket. \u201cI\u2019m in heaven,\u201d she declared.</p><p>Max stopped at the side of the bed, grinning. \u201cYou never could resist a good jump. Remember when we were at your cousin Brian\u2019s and I rigged up that awful contraption so you could pretend you were an Olympic gymnast?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s right! I tried to leap over but you made it too high and I broke my wrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d be punished for months, but you came back from the doctor and no one ever mentioned it again.\u201d</p><p>She propped up her elbow and rested her cheek in her palm. \u201cBecause I never told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Carina smiled at the memory. \u201cI knew you\u2019d get in trouble. Hell, you and Michael were always put in charge of making sure I was safe. I told Mama I built the thing myself.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long time without blinking. \u201cYou lied for me?\u201d</p><p>The soft question suddenly did bad things to her tummy. He looked at her as if seeing her in a new perspective, but she didn\u2019t know if it was a good or bad thing. Maybe bringing up childhood wasn\u2019t a great idea in her master seduction plan. She\u2019d better change tactics quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking to upgrade that awful futon in Alexa\u2019s apartment. Let me know what you think of this mattress.\u201d</p><p>He flinched, then stepped back. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, there\u2019s plenty of room. I don\u2019t have cooties. Just lay down and let me know if it\u2019s better than your bed at home.\u201d</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cHow would you know what type of bed I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but you seem a bit pompous about all this luxury so I figured it must be huge. You don\u2019t have one of those awful bachelor bedrooms with zebra patterns and hidden speaker music that impulsively plays Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d do you?\u201d</p><p>He drew back in horror. \u201cWhat do you know about stuff like that? There are so many things wrong with that scenario, I can\u2019t even list them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Guy I was going out with had one of those setups. He shut the door behind him, pressed a button, and this awful song came on to get me in the mood.\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer. \u201cI hope you didn\u2019t give him what he wanted. Not with that type of cheap trick.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNope, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d She scooted over, moved one of the pillows, and motioned for him to join her. \u201cJust a minute. Tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Wouldn\u2019t want you to mess up your suit.\u201d</p><p>Her remark hit home. His features tightened like she\u2019d thrown out a dare. Never one to back down from a challenge, he toed off his shoes. She tamped down a giggle when he carefully positioned himself next to her with a huge space between them.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re rating beds. I feel like I\u2019m in a Sleepy\u2019s commercial.\u201d</p><p>She bounced up and down. \u201cFirm, yet plenty of give. The sheets definitely have a high thread count. And the pillows are perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pillows suck. Men hate fluffy pillows, they feel like they\u2019re suffocating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But the mattress is a good thickness. Firm but with enough give for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body stiffened. Carina held her breath as his head turned. Their gazes locked and she practically shook with the need to climb on top of him, press her mouth over his, and surrender. His pupils dilated and his jaw clenched. She waited. Moved an extra inch closer, making sure her shirt dipped down to expose a hint of cleavage. With deliberate casualness, she cocked her leg sideways and her skirt slid indecently high up her thigh. His delicious scent of aftershave, lemon, and clean soap swarmed her, more heady than any designer cologne on the market.</p><p>Tension cranked up a tight notch and buzzed through the air.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say sleep.\u201d</p><p>He rolled to the side, got up, and stared at her with disapproval.</p><p>Frustration nipped and the pulsing folds between her legs pissed her off. She pursed her lips in a sulky pout. \u201cLiar,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He moved.</p><p>With lightning speed, she found herself flat on her back. One hard knee pressed between her thighs and opened her up. He pinned her wrists over her head in a casual grip, and hovered. Carved lips paused an inch from hers, and those blue eyes shot sparks of fury and fire that set off a crazy, lustful reaction. Her body softened under his command in a need to be dominated and overtaken. All those hidden naughty fantasies sprang to life and out of the dark closet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game, cara.\u201d His voice came out in a silky purr underlaid with pure steel. \u201cChallenge a man in the big league, and you may regret it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heady satisfaction rolled through her blood and swarmed her head. Dio, she was so hot her skin practically melted off her bones. This was what she craved\u2014the domineering, sexual Max who could bring her to orgasm with one slide of his talented fingers. Carina raised her chin and met his gaze head-on. \u201cMaybe I took a turn in the majors and liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the liar?\u201d He lowered his head and nipped at her jaw. Her body shuddered and a moan built in the back of her throat. His tongue licked for a quick taste, and she arched up. \u201cYou think you can control the results, but teasing a man who\u2019s hot for you isn\u2019t wise. I thought you were smarter, little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think I want more than any man can handle?\u201d The brave words lost a bit of impact as he tugged on her earlobe and a breathy gasp escaped. \u201cAll this time you\u2019ve been wrong, Max. It\u2019s not me who can\u2019t handle them.\u201d She smiled up at him with pure challenge. \u201cThey can\u2019t handle me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. The air sparked and crackled between them. \u201cLet\u2019s find out, shall we?\u201d His mouth slammed over hers. It was a punishment kiss; a learning lesson; a control of an art form he mastered.</p> <p>Carina swore to prove him wrong.</p><p>His fingers tightened around her wrists as he plunged and conquered, so she begged for release. Carina begged, but it was for more, only more, as her body bucked to get closer and her tongue met and matched every dominant thrust. She surrendered every inch and loved every moment. Her nipples tightened to hard nubs and poked against her blouse. She grew wet and tried to open her legs farther for him, until he muttered a vile curse, shoved her skirt up, and pushed her wider.</p><p>He never released the bruising pressure of his mouth as his other hand slid up her leg and pressed his palm against her damp panties. Carina moaned and nipped his lower lip, urging him on with her body and\u2014</p><p>Suddenly there was only empty air.</p><p>She fought for breath and sanity as he stood by the bed. His eyes widened with shock and something else, something dangerous and hungry that suddenly flickered to life. She sat up, pushed back her tangled hair, and made no move to neaten her clothes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he growled in fury. \u201cYou were supposed to push me off, not get me off!\u201d</p><p>She snarled like a pissed-off pit bull. \u201cWho the hell are you to set up a challenge and not follow it through? I\u2019m not afraid of your little demonstration, Max. I told you, I\u2019m ready for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDio, you\u2019re crazy and begging for trouble. I\u2019ve had enough. I\u2019m putting you on the next flight out of here.\u201d</p><p>Body still humming with arousal, she narrowed her gaze and spit out the words. \u201cAnd what would you like me to tell Michael when I arrive back home?\u201d</p><p>He pivoted and thrust his fingers in his hair. \u201cI deserve for Michael to know. I\u2019ve betrayed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, get over yourself. It\u2019s none of my brother\u2019s business who I sleep with. You\u2019re acting like we\u2019re in medieval days where you\u2019ll duel for the loss of my honor. Poor women probably never experienced an orgasm with all those damn men trying to protect them.\u201d</p> <p>He groaned as if torn between laughter and horror. Carina enjoyed the sudden loss of his control as he struggled to learn how to deal with her. Finally. Max clung to the little girl he knew in the past, but it was time to see the reality and decide if he wanted it. Wanted her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home. I\u2019ll deal with Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She got up from the bed, smoothed down her skirt, and straightened her blouse. \u201cI\u2019m not going home. I came to learn how to close an important business deal and I will. But I want you to think about something, Max. We can have one night together. Just one. Get it out of our system, have great sex, and move back to being friends.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and backed away as if afraid she\u2019d launch herself at him. \u201cYou cannot do such a thing. I am not right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She tamped down on the hurt and embraced the gamble of having him for one night. Slake the lust she\u2019d lived with for years and move on. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on you anymore, but I have sexual needs I want to satisfy. I\u2019ve been protected and sheltered my whole life, but I\u2019m a grown woman now. It\u2019s time you accept it.\u201d</p><p>His obvious erection and conflicted expression gave her the confidence she needed. He wanted her. He was just too afraid to take his shot. Carina reached deep and gave him the truth. \u201cI\u2019m moving on, Max. I\u2019m looking for a mature, sexual relationship that satisfies me. Nothing long term. I\u2019ve just begun to spread my wings, and no male is going to clip them too soon. We\u2019re attracted to each other, respect each other, and have a common bond. Why not have a one-night stand? In Vegas. Where no one will ever have to know.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. Heat burned in his eyes. Good. He was tempted\u2014that\u2019s all she needed for now. She closed the distance between them and he sucked in his breath. Full female power shimmered within her. She smiled slowly. \u201cNow, if you wouldn\u2019t mind leaving? I\u2019m going to the pool. Catch you later.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to respond.</p> <p>Carina pushed him and the shut the door behind her.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Max studied the man across the table. Eyes flat as a shark\u2019s. Mouth set in a firm line. Not a quiver of tension in his wrists or fingers as he flipped up the card. He sat back in the cushioned chair, reached for his cigar, and grinned at Max.</p><p>\u201cAny time now.\u201d</p><p>Max ignored the taunt and concentrated on his hand. He threw the chip in. \u201cCall.\u201d He flipped over his pair of aces and waited. \u201cAny time now.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer Wells chuckled and copied the motion. Three deuces stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long, Max. I\u2019ve missed your humor. And of course, your lousy poker playing.\u201d</p><p>Max buckled and lit his own cigar. The elaborate poker table fully stocked with chips was only part of the unique features of his longtime friend\u2019s living quarters. The bar was just as impressive and one shelf alone held as many flavored vodkas, rums, and liquors as a guest could demand. The expensive artwork lining the walls would rival any famous collector\u2019s. Decorated in vivid reds and earthy tones, Sawyer Wells always reminded him of a man who revered the life of luxury and focused on every element of pleasure without apology. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to get me drunk so you tempt me into a lousy deal with your hotel.\u201d</p><p>The blond man shook his head and flicked the thick ash off the top of his cigar. His fair skin and golden eyes pegged him as a nonchalant surfer or bored prince. Until he turned sideways and revealed his scar. A wicked slash down his cheek, sometimes hidden by his long hair. Max knew both assumptions were dead wrong. The man made his own fortune, owned a sharp sense of humor, and a brain that challenged the most savvy executives. \u201cNot my hotel. I\u2019m just running the Venetian for a few more months. I\u2019m building a brand-new chain to rival that asshole Trump.\u201d Max laughed. \u201cAnd as for your drinking ability, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s better than your poker game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that deck was rigged. I should\u2019ve played on the main casino floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be poverty-stricken from a few thousand.\u201d His face reflected a memory Max never probed. They\u2019d met on a yacht in Greece, where Max had his eye on a pretty princess trying to buck her overprotective daddy. Problem occurred when Sawyer swept in with the same intention. Max won the fight and the princess. He dumped her the next day, and both men ended up with a few bruises, a hangover, and a friendship that lasted.</p><p>When he discovered Sawyer knew Mama Conte, genuine like turned into deep affection, and they\u2019d remained close throughout the years. But other than Sawyer\u2019s success and lack of parents, Max knew nothing about where he\u2019d come from. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t give a crap. As he learned from experience, a past does not make a man\u2019s future.</p><p>\u201cAny other plans while you\u2019re here?\u201d Sawyer asked. \u201cOther than my smoking you out of your money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish. Dinner, some gambling, and letting off some steam with a companion.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer arched a brow. \u201cA particular woman?\u201d</p><p>An image of Carina flashed before him. He deliberately took a puff of his cigar. \u201cNo. It\u2019s better that way.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer nodded. \u201cUsually is. No one gets hurt and the ride is all pleasure. Still, something tells me you\u2019re disturbed about something.\u201d</p><p>Max snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t use your witch senses on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be afraid of them for a reason. Shall I set you up with someone?\u201d</p><p>A grin tugged at his lips. \u201cI can get my own women, Sawyer. I don\u2019t need your sloppy seconds, but thanks for the offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can only dream to have a shot at my rejects. Remember that time in Paris? I set you up with a model and you couldn\u2019t close the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked your date more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I brought her home that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she slept with me the next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed at the insult that held no heat. Sawyer had been his partner in many female escapades, all for the lure of the close and the prospect of pleasure. An odd emptiness pulsed in his gut. Ever since Carina bounded back into his life, he\u2019d felt most of his relationships and actions were . . . flat. She made everything more vibrant and meaningful. What was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cSawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever want . . . more?\u201d</p><p>His friend restacked the cards and neatened the pile of chips. \u201cMore what?\u201d</p><p>Feeling ridiculous, he shrugged. \u201cYou know. More from women. More out of life.\u201d</p><p>He paused in his shuffling and considered the question. \u201cNot yet. I hope to one day, though. Why, Max? Do you?\u201d</p><p>He pushed the emotion aside and deliberately laughed it off. \u201cNo, just wondering. I better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I will make arrangements to see you in a few hours when I can get the second half of your money.\u201d</p><p>Max stubbed out his cigar. \u201cWhat do you Americans say? Ah, yes, dare to dream.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s laughter echoed through the room.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Three hours later, Max discreetly straightened his tie and asked the associate to check the air conditioner. Perspiration prickled on his skin under the designer suit and caused an uncomfortable itch. He tried to keep it together and get his head back in the game. Opening up a bakery in Vegas was a game changer, and he intended to succeed. After all, business was his heart and soul\u2014the only item in his life that elicited a bone-deep satisfaction and pride. He\u2019d craved that feeling his whole life as he scrambled to prove he was worthy. Just because his father didn\u2019t think of him as enough didn\u2019t mean he had to believe it. His mama showed him love and support every day. Damned if he\u2019d disappoint her by becoming a screwed-up man in therapy moaning about a parental abandonment as if it was an excuse to fail.</p><p>The problem was his concentration. Every time he focused on business or distracted himself with a game in the casino, her ridiculous offer sang in his ears and mocked his sanity. One night. And no one would have to know. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he\u2019d know. Could he live with the guilt? Would that one night set off a series of horrible events to punish him for thinking with his penis instead of his brain?</p><p>The meeting began and rolled on. Max knew Sawyer and his team were interested, even with the famous chef at the Venetian who did all the wedding catering. The consideration of a bakery in this hotel spoke volumes, though Max realized the Venetian targeted the casual buyer rather than catering. He made a note to double-check with Michael, but figured the exposure from a pedestrian store may give them a bit of variety. It would be a great testing ground. First he\u2019d need to calculate the statistics of crowds and buying habits, and crunch some numbers.</p><p>Carina kept her mouth shut, took notes, and listened intently. He began to wrap it up when Sawyer swung his attention across the table. \u201cSignorina Conte, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet Michael\u2019s sister. I look forward to working with you and Max in the future.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Her face lit up with a natural depth of emotion that still fascinated him. As if she invited every person inside her soul for a visit, not caring if he was worthy. Max always felt special when she bestowed her attention, and fiercely protective of others looking to steal a piece of her. \u201cThank you, Mr. Wells. I think La Dolce Maggie would be a perfect fit for the Venetian, and look forward to moving to the next step.\u201d</p> <p>Max let out his breath and stood. \u201cGentlemen, it\u2019s been a pleasure. We need to crunch some numbers and will get back to you on your offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fair one, Maximus.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s tone rolled soothingly as he shook his hand. \u201cWe cannot give up our specialized catering but think you\u2019ll do well profit-wise with a store in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded and kept a worried expression. \u201cI appreciate it, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s enough money for the gamble.\u201d Taking the first offer on the table was ridiculous, and both men knew it. Both also knew the game very well. Max grabbed the papers, snapped up his briefcase, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cActually, Max, I think the offer was quite generous.\u201d Carina stepped up to them with a thoughtful look. Max froze, mentally reaching out to her and praying she didn\u2019t blow it. Knowing her incredible talent for figures, she\u2019d already done the stats. Max forced a laugh and gripped her arm.</p><p>\u201cBut of course it is. Sawyer is always generous. We better go in order to make our scheduled conference call.\u201d</p> <p>Sawyer stepped neatly in front of Max and smiled warmly at Carina. A shark disguised as Nemo, he went in for the kill. \u201cWhat a talent you have for numbers, signorina! I\u2019m so glad you agree it is quite fair. For instance, you never received such an offer for your opening in Tribeca, right? I was told you took a lower opening bid in order to gain visibility for your chain. And this is what Vegas will do for you!\u201d</p><p>Max opened his mouth but it was too late.</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t realize you knew that,\u201d she said with a pleasant chuckle. \u201cThe profit margin we calculated as minimum would be met with a little extra. I think Michael will be quite pleased with your offer, as is Max.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer grinned and met Max\u2019s gaze.</p><p>Merda.</p><p>His associate in training had just rolled over on her belly and allowed the shark a fatal bite. There would be no more negotiating at this table, and Sawyer\u2019s obvious glee confirmed it. Carina beamed with success as if she had personally closed a great deal instead of killing it.</p> <p>Max clamped down on his temper. \u201cWe shall see, shan\u2019t we, Sawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her arm in warning. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He gave a final nod and guided her out the conference room, down the hallway, and into the elevator. She opened her mouth to say something, but his look must have been enough. Confusion flickered across her face, but she kept silent as they reached their room, keyed in the code, and stepped over the threshold.</p><p>He let his briefcase drop, ripped off his jacket and tie, and exploded.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done? You have an MBA, for Christ\u2019s sake\u2014and you break the first rule of business in negotiations? You never, ever tell them it\u2019s a good offer in an initial consultation. You just gave Sawyer your approval, and that means he\u2019ll never raise his offer. We now have no wiggle room and have to either accept or refuse.\u201d He cursed viciously and paced. \u201cMichael will kill me. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way out of this mess now.\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from her face. Her harsh whisper reached his ears. \u201cDio, mi dispiace. I am so sorry. I didn\u2019t think, I thought the deal was solid and I got excited and I spoke too soon. It is my fault, Max. I will take the consequences.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cThere are no consequences for you, Carina, only me. I never should have brought you in. I should have confirmed you should not speak at all and to only observe. I forgot that school training is completely different than in real life.\u201d</p><p>She marched up and blocked his next step. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to protect me on this. What I did was inexcusable, I got carried away. I will call Michael and let him know what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Max reached for a deep breath and tried to calm himself. Yelling at her wasn\u2019t an option. He could tell Michael what happened, but he was responsible for this deal\u2014not Carina. He gentled his voice. \u201cI will think of something. There is no need to involve your brother at this point. Why don\u2019t you go back to the pool and relax while I sort this out? Enjoy the hotel while we are here.\u201d</p><p>He expected a grateful smile. Instead, he got shoved back by a powerful push and stumbled once before he caught himself. Those gypsy eyes filled with fury and her body bristled with energy, reminding him of the night he kissed her. \u201cHow dare you patronize me, Maximus Gray!\u201d She snarled and curled her fists. \u201cStop protecting me and treating me like a child about to burst into tears if she gets in trouble! I screwed up and there is no excuse. It is not your fault, and I\u2019m sick to death of you taking the blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d He shook his head in total exasperation. \u201cI tell you to go to the damn pool and you\u2019re yelling at me? I don\u2019t need this right now. I\u2019m not up to playing female games of figuring out what you want. You want to be treated like a regular employee? Fine, consider yourself officially out of this deal. You\u2019ll go home tomorrow and oversee the home office while I try to dig myself out of this mess here. Better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d The expression drained out of her face, and she backed up, wrapping her arms around her middle. Suddenly, she looked so alone. Emotion clogged his throat and every cell in his body screamed to take her in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Max.\u201d She let out a humorless laugh. \u201cFrom the moment I began working here you\u2019ve been scrambling around trying to put out my fires. I need some time to think if this is the best place for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina . . .\u201d</p><p>She shook her head hard and scrambled toward the door. \u201cNo, don\u2019t. I need to be alone for a while. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Before he could say another word, she fled.</p><p>Max dropped his face into his hands and prayed for strength. Strength not to strangle her. Strength not to touch her. Strength to send her away so he didn\u2019t have to deal with this mass of crazy emotions suddenly putting him in a spin.</p><p>One night.</p><p>He forced the tantalizing image from his head. Waited a beat. Then went after her.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina sat at the bar in the casino and fiddled with the edge of the napkin placed under her apple martini. The lovely green color soothed her, along with the tart slide of liquor. How decadent to drink in the afternoon in Vegas, where night blended into day and no one cared. Maybe she\u2019d take a gondola ride later and send a photo to her mother and sisters. They\u2019d get a kick out of their baby sister in such a glamorous setting.</p><p>She choked back the tiny sob and gritted her teeth. God, she hated crying. It gave her bad memories of her rage of uncontrollable emotions years ago. While Venezia received vivacious beauty and Julietta a cool intellect, she got stuck with a junkyard of emotions. Always too giving, too trusting . . . too stupid. Always floating on the edges of life and watching others take chances. She\u2019d thought the business world would knock her into shape and give her the direction she so badly craved. A place to finally belong and feel more comfortable in her own skin. Instead, it only stretched her more tightly to the point of pain.</p><p>Whine, whine, whine.</p><p>She smiled to herself as her inner goddess took control and slapped her. She\u2019d screwed up. Bad. Now she had to fix it, instead of letting Max step in as usual and protect her. Defeat tasted bitter, but she intended to make it go down easier with her martini. Then slip on her big-girl panties and meet with Sawyer Wells. Alone.</p><p>\u201cCome here often?\u201d</p><p>She held back a sigh. He settled on the stool beside her, ordered a beer, and waited her out. \u201cMax, when are you going to learn you don\u2019t have to protect me? Can\u2019t I even sit here and get sloshed? I\u2019m alone. No big bad men. Middle of the afternoon. Go do something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Trying to drag you from the dismal depths of depression is important.\u201d His innocent grin strangled a half laugh from her. Just being in his orbit toasted her brain, and her resolve. She lifted her drink and took another sip. \u201cWe all make mistakes in the beginning. I shouldn\u2019t have yelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the only good thing you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call it a learning curve and move on, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll either take it or fix it. Maybe let Sawyer stew for a while. I\u2019m not worried.\u201d</p><p>His concerned gaze shredded her heart. She felt as if she\u2019d let him down. An MBA and she made the most basic mistake a beginner can. Show your hand too early.</p><p>Yeah, welcome to Vegas.</p><p>His hand slid across the bar and clasped her fingers. His strong, warm hand settled her nerves, and her usual defenses slid down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is right for me, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still new, cara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that. It took me a long time to learn how to balance my emotions with the need to be controlled in business. I actually enjoyed the challenge, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll never be strong enough to succeed. Instead of kicking someone\u2019s ass when they call in sick, I want to bring them chicken soup.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and tucked a stray curl behind her ear. The gentle gesture gave her enough courage to look him in the eye. Carved lips lifted in a half smile. \u201cNo one wants you to change who you are. In these few months, you\u2019ve captured everyone\u2019s heart and loyalty. And it\u2019s not because you\u2019re a pushover. It\u2019s because you\u2019re special, and everyone knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I expected to babysit a girl and keep her out of trouble. Instead, I got a woman who knows exactly what to do and is just trying to find her way. You have a strength when it comes to relationships. You know what\u2019s needed and aren\u2019t afraid to give it.\u201d He studied their interlocked hands. \u201cAnd you were right about Robin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The compliment warmed her blood. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I take business too far and forget I\u2019m dealing with people. People who make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not like my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy to fix. Best thing to do is take a breath and step away from the situation. You have a tendency to give, so if you\u2019re getting a request that tugs on your emotions, tell them you\u2019ll call them back. Stall them on a decision. That way you can assess the situation more clearly and not trap yourself in a corner. Make sense?\u201d</p> <p>Carina nodded slowly. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucked up so bad when I first started working for Michael. I fed the wrong report to an executive on a deal we were about to close. Saved the guy half a million dollars. He signed it before I caught the mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Michael do?\u201d</p><p>His eyes twinkled. \u201cGave me hell. Made me feel like shit. Then moved on and he never mentioned it again or ever held it over my head. I never gave away another dollar for free.\u201d</p><p>Her spirit lightened. The casino lit up around them with energy, but for that moment, she felt completely alone with a man who seemed to know exactly what to say to soothe her heart. \u201cI know one thing that would make me feel better. Less of a failure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDare I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCeline Dion is doing a show tonight.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cAnything else. My car, my money, my dog. Don\u2019t make me listen to \u2018My Heart Will Go On.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, how do you know the title of the song, Max?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her and took a long pull of his beer. His hand slid from hers and she tried not to mourn the loss. \u201cI watched that movie Titanic for the action only.\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed. \u201cYou are so busted. We\u2019re going. Seven o\u2019clock show.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know I can get tickets? It\u2019s probably sold out.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cGo do what you do best. Charm some helpless female. Offer her your body. We\u2019ll be all set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. As long as we agree to close this topic of conversation. You screwed up. We\u2019ll fix it and move on. Deal?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve got some meetings, so take the rest of the day off. I\u2019ll take you to dinner before the show and we\u2019ll test out the Venetian\u2019s restaurant skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>He threw a few bills on the bar and stood up. \u201cTry not to get into any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girls don\u2019t get into trouble, do they?\u201d</p> <p>He shot her a warning look and left. She nursed the rest of her martini and sifted through her options. One thing was clear. She needed to fix things on her own\u2014no matter the cost. Unfortunately, there was one way left.</p><p>Remove herself from the deal.</p><p>She traced the rim of her glass and held back a sigh. Even with her skills, her mistakes far outweighed her benefit. Maybe it was time to dig a bit deeper and find out what she really wanted instead of trying to be a carbon copy of everyone else. Her soul itched for freedom and creativity. What if La Dolce Maggie couldn\u2019t offer what she really needed?</p><p>The thoughts danced in her head but she focused on the one thing she could control.</p><p>Fix the mess. She drained her drink, grabbed her purse, and headed back to the room to contact Sawyer Wells.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Sawyer belonged in Vegas. Carina tamped down on her nervousness while he prowled across his office like a large jungle cat. He shook her hand and invited her to sit down, as if deciding to play with his food before taking a bite. And, dear God, he looked like he could bite. Sex vibrated around him in waves, but there was something deeper that scared the crap out of her. He reminded her of the blond vampire from True Blood, with golden-boy looks and seething amber eyes to hypnotize any helpless female. His lush lips held a cruel curve, and his face was a mass of hard lines with sharp cheekbones and a wicked scar that curved from his brow down his cheek. The scar only added to the dangerous appeal. He wore his hair extra long, almost like her brother, but not long enough to be held back with a tie.</p><p>She\u2019d done her homework and knew all the basics. The man boasted a long line of successful hotels he took over and pumped full of profit. Then something happened and he moved on to the next challenge. The Venetian was his current toy he took quite seriously, but the rumor mill hinted he planned to unveil a chain of luxury hotels throughout the country. He traveled to Italy frequently, and Max seemed to know him as more than a casual business partner.</p><p>She took a seat across from the sprawling teak desk and glanced around. His office was housed on the top floor of the Venetian. Ceiling-to-floor windows displayed the city in its glory, and reminded her more of a suite than a workplace, with matching teak furniture, bookcases, and a wet bar. Gorgeous artwork filled the walls, an intriguing mix of raw landscapes and erotica. She studied the lines of a couple naked but in shadow, wrapped around each other. The simple sensuality stirred something inside of her until she longed to study the picture. He caught her staring and a blush stained her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy art, Carina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much. I paint myself.\u201d</p><p>He settled in the leather chair behind his desk and studied her with a thoughtful air. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he murmured. \u201cProfessionally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I put it aside so I could finish my MBA. I miss it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should never deny a part of your soul. Eventually it will wither and die, or fester inside until you cut it out.\u201d His face shut down as if fighting an image from the past. \u201cLife is too short for regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The odd conversation rattled her. Holy crap, was that a king-size bed in the attached room? And why was she suddenly thinking he didn\u2019t only sleep there, but did other things?</p><p>\u201cI have many contacts in the art world. If you ever think of holding a serious show, let me know. My dealer can spot talent immediately.\u201d</p><p>She gave a quizzical look. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even seen my work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have good instincts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d Carina crossed her legs. His gaze snagged on the expanse of naked flesh from her skirt and slowly worked its way up her body. The appreciation in his eyes seemed to honor the woman inside rather than objectifying her body.</p><p>His gravelly voice reminded her of morning-afters and lots of nakedness. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have this time with you. My assistant said you wanted to talk about the deal. Is Max joining us?\u201d</p><p>She swiped her palms down her skirt, dug deep, and took the leap. \u201cNo, Max doesn\u2019t know I am here. I\u2019d like you to keep this between us.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. She caught her breath and wondered if he had the ability to see into her soul. \u201cHow interesting. I would usually decline, since you\u2019re not heading the negotiations, but you\u2019ve intrigued me. I can\u2019t promise to keep anything from Max, though, if I disagree with your intentions.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course. I wanted to let you know I\u2019m leaving Vegas and I\u2019m off the deal.\u201d</p><p>A shadow flickered across his features. \u201cDid you get fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Wells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer.\u201d</p><p>He remained silent but she gave him no further information. After a few moments, a reluctant smile tugged at his lips. She congratulated herself on winning the minor skirmish. \u201cIs that all you wish to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe figure I gave you was incorrect. Max already told me he\u2019ll walk from the deal if you insist on keeping to my assumption. There\u2019s just not enough profit margin to take the leap in Vegas, especially when we\u2019ll be competing with your in-house catering.\u201d</p><p>He studied her. A strange awareness trickled through her. Almost as if he catalogued her secrets and decided whether or not to challenge her. He steepled his fingers together. \u201cDoes Michael know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. So you are removing yourself from the situation in order to save the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect. You can\u2019t use my mistake against Max or my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I would threaten your brother? Use you as leverage for gaining more profit? Urge him to stick to the figure or fire you?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and refused to cower. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re a businessman. If I were you, I would have called Michael and told him if they don\u2019t give you that figure there will be no deal. I\u2019d say his sister screwed up and now had to make good.\u201d She paused. \u201cIf you push him on that issue, though, I will quit.\u201d</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed his face. \u201cYou will go as far as that to save this deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And Mr. Wells\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bluff.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cHow intriguing. You have definitely complicated things.\u201d</p><p>Relief coursed through her. Finally, she\u2019d done something beneficial for the company. At least Max started with a clean slate, and her brother wouldn\u2019t be put in an awkward situation. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will find an alternate plan. You seem to be extremely adaptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you this, Carina. Your mistake won\u2019t hold up the negotiations moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I think I\u2019m owed something in this whole deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>A smile played upon his lips. Her breath caught at the smoldering sensuality in his hooded gaze. \u201cBe my date tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy date. Unless you and Max are an item?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head a bit too hard. \u201cNo, Max and I aren\u2019t together. Why do you want to see me?\u201d</p><p>His tone held pure amusement. \u201cYou are a beautiful woman with guts. I\u2019ll take you to dinner and then we\u2019ll visit the club.\u201d</p><p>Carina tried to figure out what the game was. He was extremely attractive but out of her league. Wasn\u2019t he? She let out a snort. \u201cDon\u2019t think you can get me to spill more secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate yourself. Seven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having an early dinner and seeing a show with Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfterward, then. Ten.\u201d</p><p>Again, he waited her out. The leashed sexuality beat from him in waves. Isn\u2019t this exactly what she needed? A man who wanted her and wasn\u2019t afraid to ask? Instead of sitting next to Max hearing Celine sing about unrequited love, she could be getting to know Mr. Blond, Tall, and Sexy . . . and perhaps making her future one-night stand a bit jealous?</p><p>He laughed and shook his head. \u201cYou are a delight. I haven\u2019t had to work this hard to get a woman to agree to a cocktail in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrinks before dinner. In the bar. Six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>She walked to her suite to shower and change for the evening, not sure how her biggest business mistake had scored her a hot date. She had one last night in Vegas before returning home and intended to make the most of it.</p><p>Screw Celine Dion.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina walked through the doors of the famous V bar and looked for her date. The sleek, sultry lines of the lounge fit her mood. Double-sided leather chaise lounges flowed through the bar, and crowds had already gathered to sip their popular martinis. Frosty glass walls encased the room in privacy. Perfect for a quick cocktail before her dinner with Max. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Immediately, she was led to the corner table where Sawyer stood to greet her. He favored black, and it was the perfect color for him. Lean and graceful, his hair hit his shoulders and framed the harsh features of his face. He held a dangerous aura about him that intrigued her.</p><p>She ordered a dirty martini and they engaged in small talk.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like Vegas so far?\u201d</p><p>Carina motioned around her. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like? I\u2019ve been trapped in Bergamo my whole life, so this is like a gourmet meal after living on crackers.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled to Milan many times and know your mother. I\u2019ve always loved the tranquility of your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBergamo is part of my soul. But I\u2019ve lived with three older siblings who were overprotective, and it was hard to experience anything new and exciting. I\u2019m enjoying my taste of freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom is a heady drink.\u201d Those eyes gleamed with mischief. \u201cLike the first hit of a fine wine. The taste is more explosive due to being contained for many years.\u201d</p><p>She plucked an olive from her drink and slid it off the stick. His gaze followed her mouth in obvious interest. \u201cYou\u2019re a poet, Sawyer Wells. Who would\u2019ve thought? How do you know my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met years ago. She pulled me out of a delicate situation, and I promised her my loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted a brow. \u201cAre you going to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Carina grinned. \u201cYou must have read the handbook for women. We love a good mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked to fix us also. Save us from ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do, but you rarely let us.\u201d</p><p>A chill skated down her spine at the sudden flare of heat in his gaze. Oh, yeah, she was way out of her league. This man was a master of seduction and she belonged in training camp. Still, the heady banter and his sharp wit pulled her in, even as he scared the hell out of her.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell Max about our date?\u201d</p><p>The mention of his name yanked her back into reality. Her fingers clenched. \u201cIf he asks.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer caught the motion and leaned in. The scent of woods and musk wrapped her in sensuality. \u201cTell me about your relationship with Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother\u2019s best friend. We grew up together and he followed Michael to New York to open La Dolce Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildhood friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why so many questions about Max?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer studied her. \u201cHas he claimed you?\u201d</p><p>She sputtered on her next sip. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sleeping together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no question you should be afraid to ask, Carina. You\u2019re not only beautiful, but intelligent. A dangerous combination. I want to make sure you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>His rich tone wrapped her in possibility. This man wanted her. Why wasn\u2019t she swooning and inviting him to her room? Damn Max. Somehow, she was still stuck on her childhood crush, and it only pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free. And I\u2019m tired of talking about Max.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and snagged her hand. A pleasant jolt vibrated through her, but nothing like the intense belly-dropping excitement when Max touched her. Not that she was thinking of Max.</p><p>\u201cSo am I. Though I may need to release you to let you keep your dinner date.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head and her hair slipped over one shoulder. \u201cBut not yet.\u201d</p><p>A smile touched his lips. \u201cNo, not yet. What do you paint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortraits. Family members, babies, animals. I love looking beyond the surface of people and trying to capture something they never see. Reminds me of how my sister-in-law describes her photography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t paint a stick figure, but I can appreciate. I remember my first trip to Italy and getting drunk on the art. I was almost arrested at the Uffizi Gallery because I wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve haunted the gallery my whole life. The first time I laid eyes on the Sistine Chapel I sobbed like a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never wanted to paint professionally?\u201d</p><p>The longing washed over her, fierce and raw. The more she realized her future with La Dolce Maggie, the more her soul cried out for something different. Carina hesitated, not sure how much to share with him. \u201cYes, but I never believed in myself enough.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer nodded. \u201cI know how that feels.\u201d</p><p>The silence between them throbbed with the lure of friendship and the possibility of more.</p><p>Carina smiled. \u201cNow, tell me about the glamorous world of hotels.\u201d</p><p>They talked for the next hour until it was time to meet Max for dinner. Sawyer clasped her hand within his. \u201cCarina, I\u2019d like you to join me afterward. I\u2019ll show you the club and we can go dancing if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Carina hesitated. Her need for Max battled with the temptation before her. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in Tao waiting for you. You decide.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her cheek and left her.</p><p>Her past fantasies warred with her present.</p><p>Time to choose.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina made her way back to the lobby where Max waited for her. The look on his face when he spotted her set the tone for the evening.</p><p>His jaw dropped. His gaze took in her outfit, and his features tightened. \u201cYou can\u2019t wear that,\u201d he whispered in fury. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Carina, that dress is, that dress is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, a simple \u2018you look nice\u2019 would have been appropriate.\u201d</p><p>The moment she spotted the Versace dress she\u2019d gone nuts. An elegant crisscross of straps wrapped her breasts up in a wicked game of peekaboo, until the beholder had no idea what was fabric and what was flesh. The skirt nipped in at the waist, then fell to the floor in a series of jagged cuts, and the peachy color complemented her olive skin. A quick trip to the spa took care of her Brazilian wax, and even though she\u2019d screamed, the pain had been well worth it. She left her hair down loose and wore only a thick gold cuff around her wrists, reminding her of a sexy slave girl.</p><p>His current speechlessness made the price so well worth it. Even better when she finally turned.</p><p>He hissed in a breath. The fabric in the back started at the curve of her buttocks. She\u2019d begun the evening with a naughty game she intended to win. She tossed her next comment over her shoulder. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you can always take it off.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>The Canaletto restaurant was filled, but they were immediately ushered to a cozy table outside near St. Mark\u2019s Square. The gorgeous cream colors and glowing lights gave an air of intimate elegance, and overlooked the Grand Canal where gondolas floated past and murmurs of low conversation drifted in the air. Feeling as if she was transported to Venice, Carina relaxed and ordered a glass of Montepulciano and enjoyed the earthy richness on her tongue. Anything was better than allowing it to loll out of her mouth like an idiot.</p><p>Why did he always have to look so . . . perfect? Where Sawyer was all raw sex and darkness, Max reminded her of a polished playboy, with an easy charm and elegance bred in his bones. His suit had been replaced with a dark blue silk shirt, casual slacks, and low-heeled leather boots. His Vacheron Constantin watch gleamed burnished silver around his wrist as he reached for his wine and took a deep swallow.</p><p>The plan was simple. Use her time over dinner to seduce him. Unfortunately, she realized he decided to play his own game: memory lane. \u201cRemember the time you brought that guy home from school and Michael and I followed you to Sam\u2019s Cafe?\u201d He shook his head as if pretending to remember. \u201cWe hid in the bushes and when the dude leaned in to kiss you, Michael jumped out. Scared him so bad he left you there, so we had to take you home.\u201d</p><p>The image still stung. The humiliation of having Michael stalk her with his sidekick seriously undermined her dating life. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just remembering how overprotective your brother is. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Point taken. By throwing her big brother into the conversation, it was a definite seduction killer. Also a direct reminder of the stakes involved. She needed to up her game. Carina took another sip of wine, licked her lips, and smiled. \u201cI had a date with Sawyer this evening.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. The stunned expression on his face soothed her confidence. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Sawyer asked you on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth in masculine temper. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to see him in his office. I told him I was stepping out of the deal due to my mistake, and that the figure I gave was impossible.\u201d</p><p>A vicious curse escaped his lips. \u201cYou were supposed to let me handle it.\u201d</p><p>Carina lifted her chin. \u201cIf I make a mistake I fix it, Max. You should know that about me by now.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his forehead. \u201cI do. I just wish you didn\u2019t feel like you always have to take on the world by yourself in order to prove you\u2019re worthy.\u201d</p><p>The statement hit her full force. He did know her, more intimately than any other man. \u201cWell, it\u2019s done now. Sawyer agreed not to let my blunder affect the negotiations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you feel you had to go out with him? Did he pressure you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>He jerked back. \u201cSawyer is out of your league, Carina. Stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>He may have repeated her own thoughts but it still pissed her off. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what league I play in any longer. How long have you been friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough to know he\u2019s not right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who is?\u201d</p><p>He practically brooded at the direct challenge, focusing his attention on his wine. She hoped for a bit of jealousy to throw him off, but once again, he backed off from a challenge by hiding behind a twisted sense of honor. \u201cLet\u2019s change the subject, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I got a Brazilian wax today.\u201d</p><p>He choked on the piece of bread in his mouth. Eyes watering, he lowered his voice. \u201cAre you kidding me? Don\u2019t talk about stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>The sweat beading his brow told her he was uncomfortable in other aspects. \u201cWhy not? If you insist on topics of conversation that portray me as a little girl, I guess I have to remind you I\u2019m all grown up.\u201d She winked. \u201cWanna see?\u201d</p><p>A flush crept up his cheek. \u201cNo. And don\u2019t let anyone else see, either.\u201d He shifted in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re playing a screwed-up game with me and you\u2019re not thinking of the consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go over the options then, shall we?\u201d She put up her hand and ticked off the items with each finger. \u201cWe\u2019re both consenting adults. Attracted to each other. It\u2019s only for one night. And we move on. What\u2019s the problem I\u2019m missing?\u201d</p><p>The waiter set down matching plates of Chilean sea bass baked under a hard salty crust. The Yukon potatoes were chopped and served tableside, dripping with oil, garlic, and herbs. She speared a flaky piece of fish and moaned over the gorgeous texture and crisp skin. \u201cDamn, this is good,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. The polenta is cooked perfectly. Try it paired with the tomato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They ate in reverent silence for a while, each lapsing into a food-induced coma of pleasure. Finally he roused himself and took up the conversation. \u201cLet me tell you all the reasons we shouldn\u2019t have an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne-night stand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever. First, your brother trusts me to protect you and I would lose his loyalty. Second, our mothers know each other and they\u2019d freak. Third, you technically work for me, and that could blur the lines between us in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael and our moms will never know. Our work relationship won\u2019t be affected since I\u2019ll be with another division. Why shouldn\u2019t we indulge ourselves? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if you were my first sexual experience rather than someone I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Anger spit in waves around him. \u201cDon\u2019t throw away your virginity for some society crap that tells women to seize the day. It should be special, with someone you love. Not used on a physical fling with no future. The answer is no. You can argue and cajole and tempt me all you want. I am not going to sleep with you or engage in a short affair that could ruin our whole foundation. I won\u2019t risk it.\u201d</p><p>Raw need burst from her belly and strangled her. It wasn\u2019t going to work. Her one-night fantasy was just that\u2014a fantasy. Deep down, she just wasn\u2019t worth the risk to him. Another experience that told her she wasn\u2019t the type of woman to drive a man so mad with desire he\u2019d break the rules. Even half-naked and throwing her pride away. Dear God, even her seduction attempts were centered around a logical conversation of assets and liabilities for an affair. Humiliation burned. She craved to crawl into her bed, pull the covers up over her head, and cry. Just like she\u2019d done so many times in her past when she realized Maximus Gray could never want her in the crazy way she did him.</p><p>The dream wafted away in a cloud of smoke, almost like a mirage. Max gazed at her with concern. The same damn look he always gave that could never satisfy or scratch the surface of her darkest fantasies.</p> <p>Maybe someone else could.</p><p>An image of Sawyer flashed in her mind. A man interested in her like a woman, not a childhood friend. With him, she may be able to experience everything she craved. Maybe it was time to take the leap into the unknown. She was so tired of going to bed night after night alone. Lonely and unsatisfied at twenty-six years old. How sad was that?</p><p>Slowly, she blotted her lips with the napkin and forced a smile. \u201cI guess your decision is made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, this is best for all of us involved.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cUnderstood. There\u2019s one thing you must promise me though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Carina lifted her chin and met his gaze. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I upset you, cara. Please don\u2019t tell me I\u2019ve lost your friendship. It means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>She forced back the tears that burned her lids. \u201cYou\u2019ll never lose me completely. In a way, I think I\u2019ll always be a part of your life. But I can\u2019t play this game anymore. I need to move on and make my own choices, on my own terms. Tonight, you made the decision to cut the ties between us. You lost your right to tell me who to sleep with.\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and leaned forward. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to disrespect yourself in order to get back at me.\u201d</p><p>A humorless laugh escaped her lips. \u201cDio, how arrogant. And you have every right to think that, because I\u2019ve given you so much power. But not anymore. I won\u2019t sleep alone tonight. And that\u2019s not because I\u2019m disrespecting myself, you bastard. It\u2019s because I\u2019m finally claiming what I\u2019ve wanted for a long time. A man who makes me explode with pleasure and can take me places I crave to go. A man to hold me and give me orgasms and share the night with. You gave up that right tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her chair back and stood. \u201cIf you have any respect for me at all, you\u2019ll leave me alone. I deserve that, Max.\u201d Carina put her napkin down. \u201cThank you for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p> <p>She paused. Seconds ticked by. The sounds of the busy restaurant flowed around them, the click of silverware and glasses, the ringing of laughter, the slide of the boats cutting through the water below. She waited as he seemed to struggle with his demons. A muscle in his jaw ticked.</p><p>A turning point hung between them. Her heart pounded and she waited for his final decision. His carved features twisted into a tortured expression and he opened his mouth. His words hung in the air like a cartoon balloon, blank until the artist sketched in the final ending.</p><p>His mouth closed. He gave a curt nod and she gazed at an unemotional stranger who made his decision.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bother you again.\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened but she kept herself together. When she walked away, she refused to look back.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Max stared at the jumble of plates on the table and clutched at the edges of his sanity. He grabbed his wineglass, drained the rest of the liquid, and signaled for a refill. The evening turned into a disaster and he wasn\u2019t even sure why a crazy panic pumped through his veins.</p><p>He\u2019d made the right decision. Fuck, the only decision. There was no way he could take Carina to bed for one night, claim her virginity, and go back to business. Why couldn\u2019t she understand that?</p><p>I\u2019m not sleeping alone tonight.</p><p>Sawyer.</p><p>Her final words haunted him. Would she seek his friend out to prove a point? Was she attracted to him? What did she mean by \u201cdark desires\u201d or \u201cfantasies\u201d? His fists clenched in his lap as an array of images taunted him. Carina naked with another man. Carina moaning, head thrown back, biting down on that lush lower lip as some stranger pushed inside of her. Carina murmuring another man\u2019s name.</p><p>He fought the rage and madness and reminded himself to calm down. First off, she talked a good game, but he doubted she\u2019d go through with it. She\u2019d probably flirt a bit, dance, maybe even kiss someone to satisfy her curiosity. All he needed to do was keep his distance and an eye on her. He wouldn\u2019t interfere, and she\u2019d never spot him.</p><p>When her experiment ended, they\u2019d go back to New York and maybe things would calm down. She\u2019d date some nice man who was worthy of her and didn\u2019t have any hang-ups. Someone nice and younger and respectable. Not an older, jaded, screwed-up male who had commitment issues like him. Being with her in any capacity was a guaranteed disaster. He\u2019d hurt her and would never be able to stand himself. He\u2019d lose Michael\u2019s friendship, respect, and his career.</p><p>A one-night stand just wasn\u2019t worth it. Not even with a woman who soothed his soul and made him crave to be a better man.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy your dinner with Max?\u201d</p><p>Carina sat in a private skybox above the Tao nightclub. Sawyer met her at the door where the famous twenty-foot Buddha statue greeted guests. Shocked at the dueling contrast of raw sexuality and soothing spirituality the club offered, Carina knew she\u2019d made the right decision. Skimpily clad females bathed in huge marble tubs of rose petals, while the red walls and candlelight warmed the senses. It was a place to lose herself and her inhibitions. The hip-hop music whipped the crowds into a frenzy, but Sawyer immediately took her elbow and guided her upstairs to a suite hidden behind lush velvet curtains.</p><p>Champagne chilled in delicate flutes and bouquets of flowers filled the room with exotic scents. Obviously soundproof, no loud music echoed in his sanctuary. A chill skated down her spine at the question.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was fine.\u201d She sipped her champagne while her companion ate her up with his gaze. The leashed intensity in his eyes rattled her but she refused to cower. Sawyer Wells was getting lucky tonight, and so was she. End of story.</p><p>The look on Max\u2019s face had finally slammed the door on their past.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>His command shook her out of the trance. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>The truth pulsed between them. Suddenly, her simple flirtation spun into the express lane. As if he knew the question went much deeper, he waited for her answer. The night stretched before her with endless possibilities\u2014and she was sick of coming in second place with a man. In that moment, she relished her freedom and the choices before her. This time she wouldn\u2019t choose wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted in a smile, and suddenly he loomed over her. All that sensual heat swarmed around her. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Tonight I want to give you pleasure. I haven\u2019t been this intrigued by a woman in as long as I can remember.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps peppered her arms. Several glasses of champagne flowed into more, until a pleasant buzz tickled her ears and the world became beautifully blurry. She sensed a close to the evening that would end up in his bed and fell into chatter. \u201cDo you bring all women up to your club to seduce them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Most of them try to seduce me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do they do it?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. But I don\u2019t want to talk about other women. Do you like music? Dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we check out the club, then?\u201d</p><p>She vibrated with pleasure. \u201cI\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>He led her out from the curtains, down the stairs, and into the main room. The music ground through the speakers in a dirty hip-hop rhythm. Her blood heated from alcohol, she linked her arm through his and he negotiated the throng of people with ease. Women in short glittery skirts and high heels shook their hips. Men grabbed hips and buttocks and thrust back and forth in a public display of their wares. Lights blinded and flashed. The earthy sexiness of half-naked bodies, perfume, and sweat filled the air, and something deep inside her shook free and released.</p><p>Freedom throbbed in her veins and heat burned inside of her as she danced. Sawyer grabbed her and pulled her close, and she slid her arms around his neck. With each beat of the music, their bodies touched, slid, and reconnected. The glorious smell of him tempted her to take the final step. Her eyes closed.</p><p>His fingers tangled in her hair and he spoke against her ear. \u201cCome to my room.\u201d</p><p>The word yes hovered on her lips.</p><p>Her lids slid open. She needed more time to decide. She ignored his question and continued to dance, letting the music pulse through her.</p><p>Her gaze connected with a pair of piercing blue eyes behind Sawyer.</p><p>Max.</p><p>He stood by the bar, set off from the crowd as he stood alone and watched her. Regret screamed for release, for only him, but it was too late and she needed to let him go.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she suddenly blasted at Sawyer.</p><p>She waited for Sawyer to kiss her. Instead, he pulled back and studied her expression. Then slowly turned around.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Carina gripped his hand and pulled him off the dance floor, but it was already too late. Max loomed before her, every muscle vibrating with pure fury. Her blood heated in response and her panties grew wet. Her body rose to life under his command.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d His words were directed at Sawyer but she jumped between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNone of your business,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou promised to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer stared at his friend with hard eyes. \u201cCalm down, my friend. You are not dating each other, and she made it clear she\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Michael\u2019s sister, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? She is also a beautiful woman who chooses her own lovers. I think she has made her choice for the evening.\u201d</p> <p>His hand shot out and grabbed Sawyer by the collar. \u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer had no time to react. Her inner demon sprung out and she launched herself at Max, shoving him hard. \u201cYou have no right,\u201d she yelled. \u201cLeave us alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarina, you have no idea what you\u2019re doing.\u201d He shook Sawyer in a male fit of temper she\u2019d never glimpsed in him before.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Suddenly, Sawyer was free and stepped out of Max\u2019s line of fire. \u201cCarina, darling, please sit here for a moment. I\u2019ll be right back. I need to talk to Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Shaking with pent-up emotion, she gave a jerky nod and sat down on the nearest stool. She watched Sawyer drag him away. Why was he doing this? He didn\u2019t want her enough for himself, but refused to give her the opportunity to belong to anyone else. The sick game they\u2019d played over the past few months twisted her in knots.</p><p>One song passed. Another. She watched the crowd lose themselves in the music and jumped up from her seat. Screw Max. Screw Sawyer. Screw them all.</p><p>She was going to dance.</p><p>Carina pushed herself onto the floor and gave herself up to the music.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Max was used to dealing with a range of emotions. When he was finally old enough to learn the truth about his father, he experienced wrenching anger. Black, coiling fury that twisted his insides and choked him with strength. So, he used his youth to make himself worthy. Enough so that his father would eventually seek him out and claim him as a son. When he failed once again, he experienced the bitter taste of defeat, grief, and a desire for revenge.</p><p>Nothing compared to the moment he\u2019d seen Carina in Sawyer\u2019s arms.</p><p>He followed Sawyer to his private table, where the scent of Carina still lingered in the air. His fingers flexed and he panted like a boxer going a dozen rounds, refusing to succumb to a knockout. \u201cWhat are you doing with Carina?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer smoothed out the wrinkles in his shirt and gave him a warning glare. \u201cThe only reason you were able to touch me was because I let you. Once, my friend. Don\u2019t test me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to touch her, and I can kick your ass as well as I did ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>A touch of a smile curved Sawyer\u2019s lips. \u201cAh, I remember that. But I was drunk at the time. You won the woman that time. As usual you didn\u2019t keep her for long. This time, I think you are too late.\u201d</p><p>Max paced the room in an effort not to jump him and beat the shit out of his old friend. \u201cListen up. She\u2019s an innocent, and Michael\u2019s younger sister. If you touch her, he\u2019ll fly here in a heartbeat and make your life a living hell.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer waved his hand in dismissal. \u201cI\u2019m not so easily cowed if I see a woman I want. A woman worthy of the fight. Didn\u2019t you give her up? I made sure to question your relationship and she told me several times you are not together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not with her! I\u2019d never betray Michael or fuck up her life. You\u2019re into a different lifestyle, Sawyer, stuff way over her head. She deserves better than you or me. She needs a committed relationship.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer studied him for a while, his dark eyes cutting through the bullshit and hitting the core. \u201cCarina never stated she wanted someone long term. In fact, it seems the opposite. You have always enjoyed being the dominant partner in your sex life. Why are my choices so different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all about power and sex with me. Merda! She is a virgin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so afraid of her virginity? I think you\u2019re more attached to it than her.\u201d He pointed a finger at him. \u201cHave you really looked at her? As soon as I took control she practically melted in my hands. She has submissive tendencies and will do best with a dominant lover, someone to push her boundaries. I normally like a woman who\u2019s a bit more worldly and experienced, but Carina is bursting at the seams for a sensual experience. She just needs the right man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man\u2019s not you. You\u2019ve never crossed the line with business before. We have a deal on the table.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer walked over to the bar and poured two glasses of cognac. \u201cCarina is no longer working on this deal. She quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but she still works for the company.\u201d</p><p>He handed him the glass and Max threw back the liquid in one clean shot. \u201cShe confessed something to me today. She seems on the verge of making a decision about staying with the company or choosing a different future, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready to acknowledge it yet.\u201d Sawyer grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s a spitfire trapped in an innocent shell. Once she finds her passion she\u2019ll be unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>The idea she\u2019d engaged in such an intimate conversation with Sawyer rattled his nerves. He slammed the glass on the table and raked his fingers through his hair. What the hell was happening? He grabbed onto the only thing left to control. \u201cI\u2019ll call Michael tonight if you touch her. He\u2019ll ruin you and I\u2019ll put you in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>His friend roared with laughter and only pissed him off further. \u201cDo you even hear yourself? Carina\u2019s not a toy or a possession but a grown woman. But it seems you know that. You just don\u2019t want to think of her like that because then you\u2019d have no more excuses.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer shook his head. \u201cYou have it bad, Maximus. Normally I\u2019d go after what I want and care nothing for the consequences, especially for a woman as magnificent as Carina. She is an innocent and a born Eve within one. Her spirit is giving and pure. She\u2019s worth fighting for.\u201d His amusement died and a challenge sparked the air. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019ll step aside is the look on her face when she saw you. She\u2019s attracted to me, but it\u2019s only on the surface. You\u2019re the one she wants.\u201d Sawyer moved away and muttered a curse. \u201cI don\u2019t like playing stand-in for the lover she craves. Resolve this with her, or I\u2019ll take my chance sooner rather than later.\u201d</p><p>A wrenching anguish tore through Max. He couldn\u2019t resist her again. If she offered herself one more time, he\u2019d go to hell and take the consequences. Sliding into her tight heat and fucking her endlessly until he wrung her out of his system was his only recourse. His moral code and bone-deep desire waged a nasty battle.</p><p>As if sensing his conflict, Sawyer closed the distance between them and clasped his shoulder. \u201cDo you want her?\u201d</p><p>Man to man, he gazed at his friend and told the truth. \u201cYes. But I\u2019ll be giving up everything I believe in. It can never work between us. She\u2019s too good for me.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer nodded. \u201cWe never know the future. I guess it depends on how much you\u2019re willing to bet.\u201d</p><p>His thoughts whirled in a dizzying array. The demons won, inciting a lust and excitement he\u2019d never experienced. The endless months of tension rose to a crescendo, until all he could focus on was finally claiming her. To bury himself in her scent and heat. To feel her mouth open under his, slide his fingers in her hair. To hear her laughter and moans, and to be the man to finally teach her about pleasure. To claim her for just one night and touch heaven.</p><p>Without another word, he left the suite and went to find her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long. No longer at the stool, he spotted her on the dance floor amidst a tangle of men and women in a drunken world where music ruled and darkness masked the realities of the day. In Vegas, the night always won.</p><p>Her skin glowed underneath the spinning lights. Perspiration slid down her neck and trickled down the valley of her breasts. She threw her head back and spun, and he sucked in his breath as he realized Sawyer was right. Carina exuded the power of the goddess, evident in the smiling curve of her lips, closed eyes, and swaying hips. The dress swirled and revealed the bare skin of her thighs. Suddenly, he knew he\u2019d die if he didn\u2019t have her.</p><p>All roads led to this moment and the woman in front of him.</p><p>He eased himself over to her, grasped her hips, and pulled her hard against him.</p><p>Her eyes flew open, and she let out her breath in a sharp whoosh. His erection bulged in his pants and he drew her close so she got the full power of his arousal. His temptress didn\u2019t welcome him into her arms and smile with invitation.</p><p>Instead, she sneered and jerked her chin. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Go find yourself a nice cocktail waitress. Where\u2019s Sawyer?\u201d</p><p>He realized then this wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but it would be fun. \u201cNot here. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>She snorted and didn\u2019t give an inch. \u201cI don\u2019t need to get over it, Max. Since you\u2019re not the man for the job, why don\u2019t you step aside?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Dipped his head. And bit the sensitive curve of her neck.</p><p>A shudder wracked through her. His hand reached out and raked over the hard nub of her nipples poking through the fabric. Dear God, thank you. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra. \u201cI screwed up. Sawyer made me see what an asshole I\u2019ve been. Denying how much I want you. Denying what\u2019s between us.\u201d His thumb flicked the tip of her breast again. \u201cI\u2019m done running away.\u201d</p><p>She refused to surrender. \u201cLiar. You\u2019re going to walk me to my room and tuck me into bed. Tell me I\u2019ll feel better in the morning and pat yourself on the back for getting innocent Carina away from the big bad wolf. Fuck you, Maximus Gray. I\u2019m finding Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in his arms but he spun her around and lifted her buttocks up hard against him. This time, he caught her tiny gasp as he crushed his mouth over hers.</p><p>The music pounded and his tongue dived deep, pushing into every corner and making sure she knew who mastered who. In seconds, her body melted in surrender, and her fingers thrust into his hair. He took his time until his intention was known, then slowly broke the kiss.</p><p>Her lower lip trembled. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the big bad wolf, sweetheart. Now get your ass up to your room.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut to deny the truth, but she deserved more. When he finally opened his eyes, he let her see it all. \u201cBecause I want you. I\u2019ve always wanted you, Carina. I don\u2019t deserve you, or this night, but the idea of another man touching you makes me want to beat the shit out of him.\u201d</p><p>The smile that lit up her face punched straight through his chest. \u201cWell, okay then. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He dragged her off the dance floor, his fingers firmly gripped within hers, through the casino where the sounds of ringing slot machines rose in the air. Through a large crowd gathered around the roulette table, cheering on a man dressed in dirty cutoffs and a T-shirt with a towering stack of chips beside him. Around the cherrywood bar filled with couples dressed in glittery cocktail dresses and tuxedoes, with neon drinks by their side. Into the elevators where he slid the card in the slot, shot to the penthouse, and led her to the room. They kept their silence, past the time for any words. Only action. He fumbled once with the lock, finally got her into the room, and kicked the door closed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max dreamed many times of seducing Carina Conte. Since she exploded back into his life, he\u2019d spent most guilty nights with his dick in hand and an image of her behind his closed lids. Most of his fantasies revolved around a slow introduction to sex\u2014lots of foreplay, gentle kisses, and a careful push into her soft flesh. Flickering candles, romantic music, and a big, soft bed.</p><p>Tonight, there was only a biting drive to own, claim, pleasure. He slammed her against the wall, pushed her dress up, and took her mouth. His fingers hit soft skin blistering with heat, and he swallowed her moans while his tongue thrust against hers. She tasted of champagne, rich chocolate, and a heady combination of sin. Max nipped at her lower lip and cupped her buttocks to lift her more solidly against him. His head spun and he battled the iron control he usually sported in his bedroom activities. Never had he experienced such a raw driving need to take, claim, and own. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for teasing me, sweetheart. Make no mistake.\u201d</p><p>She arched up and he scented her arousal. Satisfaction surged at her reaction to his words. She liked verbal foreplay, one of his favorite activities. He trailed tiny kisses and nips down the sensitive curve of her neck while his thigh pushed her legs farther apart so he had full access. His innocent virgin bit down hard on his earlobe. \u201cSo far you\u2019ve been a lot of talk and no action.\u201d</p><p>Max grinned. And pulled down her panties. \u201cOrgasm number one. I\u2019ll give you what you really want only when you apologize for your mouthiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>He did. One finger plunged deep while his thumb hit her clit. She dripped around his finger, and he added another as he massaged her tight channel, all while rotating with teasing circles around the tight nub. She cried out and twisted, fighting him for more in a demand no experienced woman ever owned. Her nails dug into his shoulders as she reached, and a scream ripped from her throat as the orgasm crashed over her. Max watched her face as she fell apart, and his cock throbbed with a painful need to finish and take her. Instead, he extended her pleasure by continuing his rhythm and gentling the ride. She slumped against him and Max dug deep for control.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she moaned. Her body trembled in her aftermath. He kissed that swollen mouth and dove in for another taste. \u201cThat was so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not done with you. Do I hear an apology yet?\u201d</p><p>A satisfied smirk curved her lips. \u201cI haven\u2019t waited all these years for that, have I?\u201d</p><p>Dio, where had she come from?</p><p>\u201cYou always were a bit of a brat. Let\u2019s play, shall we?\u201d He dipped his head and found her nipple through the silk fabric. He used his tongue to dampen the fabric, then moved it aside and sucked. Whisper-soft touches over her pussy only added to the torture, and soon she panted and arched against his hand, begging for more. \u201cReady to apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. I\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m ready to accept your apology.\u201d He tugged on the tight bud and swirled his tongue, then moved to the other breast. He played and pushed her right back to the edge, until she lost all pride and begged. The litany of his name on her lips shook through him and raw possession beat through his blood. One more swipe of her clit; a bite at her nipple, and she dived over again.</p><p>She shuddered and gave him everything. Too far gone to play anymore, he unzipped her dress and pushed it to the floor. Her glorious body staggered him. Heavy breasts crowned with ruby nipples. A soft swell to her hips and stomach. Endless olive skin and a bare pussy from the waxing she tortured him with. Her lips glistened wet and pink under his stare, and he muttered a curse and swept her in his arms. He pushed her down on the bed and stripped, placing a condom at the bottom of the bed.</p><p>She lay back and watched with hungry eyes that only hardened him further. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>He shook his head and joined her on the bed. \u201cNo, you\u2019re fucking gorgeous. Beyond anything I ever dreamed of. But you still owe me for that torment of the Brazilian.\u201d</p><p>Her hands stroked his back, his buttocks, his thighs. Her gentle hands and sting of nails tortured his stamina. Dear God, he may not be able to last much longer, but he wanted her to be so aroused and wet, she\u2019d never feel any pain when he took her for the first time.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her deep and the rich scent of coconut from her body cream rose to his nostrils. \u201cI need to investigate further.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cOrgasm number three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, I don\u2019t think\u2014oh, God!\u201d</p><p>He pushed her thighs apart and buried his mouth against the crease of her pelvis. No hair marred the perfection of her womanhood laid bare for his exploration. He pressed open-mouth kisses over her mound, down her thighs, over her belly. Used his fingers to separate her lips. And tasted.</p> <p>Her cries grew frantic and sang in his ears. Her flavor of musk and earth and arousal overwhelmed him and he took every last drop, every thrust into her channel, every lick across her clit as a bestowal of his humbleness for her gift. Soon, she came again, and Max knew he was done. With trembling fingers, he grabbed the condom and ripped open the package. Sheathed himself. And slid back up her body.</p><p>Her dark eyes were blurred and hazy, and her body shuddered from her orgasms. \u201cBaby, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She fought for focus. \u201cYou win, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her magnificence floored him. Would another woman ever compare? Was he wrecked for the rest of his life, as he pursued someone who could give as much as Carina?</p><p>\u201cReady for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Show me what I\u2019ve been missing.\u201d</p><p>He pushed in one inch. Another. She gripped his shoulders and asked for more. Sweat pricked his brow and his muscles tightened with excruciating agony. God, she was so wet and hot, but he didn\u2019t want to hurt her. One more inch and he was almost halfway there. If he didn\u2019t die first.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cMore. Don\u2019t give me this careful bullshit, Maximus Gray. Take me now!\u201d</p><p>He gritted his teeth and bore down. Then plunged.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Wet satin and so tight he\u2019d dived into heaven and hell. She wrapped her legs around his hips and dug her heels in deep. Head flung back into the pillow, she asked for more. And he gave it to her.</p><p>Every deep thrust squeezed him with blinding heat and need. He set a steady rhythm that soon exploded into a crazy ride of lust and want. Desperate, Max grabbed for the control to slow, but she wouldn\u2019t let him. She cried and begged and demanded until he let go of his control and give them what they both wanted.</p><p>She tightened beneath him and exploded.</p><p>He followed her over. The orgasm splintered him into jagged pieces and he shouted her name.</p><p>He rolled and tucked her into the curve of his arms, pulling the sheet over them. He pressed a kiss into her tangled hair.</p><p>This virgin had just blown his mind.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina surfaced from the best sleep of her life. The room remained dark, and time blurred. Her muscles ached like a pleasurable morning-after workout. She stretched and hit a rock-hard chest.</p><p>Max.</p><p>In her bed.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Joy bloomed. She wondered her whole life what it would feel like to have Max\u2019s full attention in the bedroom. And damned if her fantasy paled to the reality. He was a fierce, savage lover who demanded all and gave it back. No wonder she hadn\u2019t felt the urge to give away her virginity until now. Those gentle, polite seductions didn\u2019t make her burn. Max\u2019s fire and dominance satisfied something she never knew she possessed. Her body was wrung out and used as well as her heart.</p><p>Tonight was a rare gift of epic proportions. Her heart ached at the thought of the morning, but at least she\u2019d have this precious memory and an in-depth knowledge of her soul.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re ready for round twenty-four.\u201d He groaned and dragged her on top of him. His jet-black hair was deliciously mussed. The rough stubble around his chin emphasized the sensual curve of his lower lip. And boy could he do wicked things with those lips. Carina buried her face against his chest. A solid wall of muscle cushioned her cheek, and the crisp hair tickled her jaw. She ran her fingers over the whipcord length of his biceps and breathed in the delicious smell of sex, soap, and man.</p><p>\u201cThose eight years really suck for stamina, huh?\u201d</p><p>He grunted and smacked her buttocks. She yelped, but the pleasant sting only made her more aroused, and she wiggled over his suddenly hardening penis. \u201cBrat. Will you ever be tamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf those are the types of punishments I get, then I hope not.\u201d</p><p>Max blinked with the lazy air of a predator after a catnap. \u201cI may need more time to recover in between, but I can go for longer rounds without begging stop.\u201d</p><p>Her belly plunged and a delicious shiver raced down her spine. She\u2019d never have enough of him\u2014in bed or out. \u201cYou\u2019ve had more practice. Give me time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, twisted his fingers in her hair, and brought her mouth down to his. \u201cSlave driver.\u201d He kissed her thoroughly but with a depth that told her he was in no rush, though his body stated otherwise. \u201cYou need a bath to relax those muscles. I don\u2019t want you too sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot morning. They don\u2019t have clocks in the room and I don\u2019t care. You\u2019re mine until dawn.\u201d</p><p>His casual command made her nipples peak with interest. With one last pat on her backside, he rolled off the bed and stalked into the adjoining bath. Moments later, the rush of water reached her ears. \u201cI always wanted to use that spa tub, but it looked too lonely for one.\u201d Naked, he walked over to the bed and reached out his hand. The stubble around his jaw gave him a rakish look and reminded her of the delicious pirates from the historical romance novels she loved. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She inched herself off the bed and tugged the sheet with her.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He ripped the sheet from her grip and took in her naked form. \u201cYou are too damn gorgeous to waste on the hotel\u2019s linens.\u201d Carina tamped down on the sudden spurt of modesty and followed him to the master bath. He walked with a masculine grace that set off his rock-hard ass. Her mouth watered and imagined how her teeth would sink into those hard muscles.</p><p>Her bare feet coasted over the gleaming marble, and he\u2019d piped in some sexy R&amp;B music. The sky-high ceilings gave her an impression of being bathed in the ancient baths as light poured down from them and a huge wall mirror hung on the opposite side of the wall.</p><p>He led her up the few steps and eased her in. The steaming hot water seeped into her skin and melted the stiffness. Fat bubbles cloaked her in a gorgeous lavender scent. He shut off the water and stood before her in full glory.</p><p>Dear God, he reminded her of the proud statue of David. Sinewy muscle carved out his shoulders and arms as he rested them on his hips. Rich brown skin gleamed with a fine sheen of sweat. His chest held a swirl of dark hair that narrowed to a thin line down his stomach and beyond. Feet apart, his powerful thighs braced, he held an aura of power and grace, naked and clothed\u2014a man comfortable in bare skin. When her gaze settled on his heavy erection, she experienced her first blush. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, you do have some shyness left. Let\u2019s make sure we wring that out of you before your next orgasm.\u201d</p><p>His dirty words revved her up and already her nipples poked through the suds. He gave a low laugh and joined her in the bath. Grabbing her hips, he slid her easily over and on top of him so she sprawled on his lap. Her back pressed against his chest, and his fingers circled her breasts, occasionally flicking her nipple with his thumb. Carina moaned and wiggled on his lap. The wet slide of their bodies together and over her intimate parts drove her mad. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hair over to one side and nibbled on her neck. \u201cYou have so many sensitive parts I don\u2019t want to miss any. Clothes should be illegal for you to wear. I\u2019d keep you naked.\u201d</p><p>She laughed but he was doing something very naughty between her legs and the sound turned to a gasp. \u201cI eat too much. Julietta and Venezia always diet to remain thin.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her breasts. \u201cAnd they have no fun parts to play with. Trust me, Carina, I\u2019ve never lusted after a woman as hard as you. Your curves inspire erotic art and a thousand orgasms.\u201d His words rang true and clear and something relaxed inside of her. Her legs floated apart and gave him better access.</p><p>\u201cI think you get a reward for that statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll take it now.\u201d Suddenly he reared up and guided her onto her knees. Excitement at the vulnerable position only made her wetter, and she glimpsed their reflection in the full-length mirror.</p><p>He muttered something under his breath and caught her gaze in the mirror.</p><p>She didn\u2019t recognize the woman before her. Naked. Kneeling. Her wild hair around her shoulders, bruised lips, and a dreamy look in her eyes. Max looked like a warrior about to claim his woman, and she watched with fascination as he grabbed a condom and covered himself.</p><p>\u201cYou like to watch?\u201d His husky question ripped a moan from her lips. She nodded, wondering why she wanted to do everything with him tonight, until she collapsed completely sated and spent. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Hold on to the edge of the tub.\u201d</p><p>She clutched at the sleek white marble and held on. His hands rubbed her ass, as if warming her up for something, and then he was inside her in one sharp thrust.</p><p>The pleasure was too intense. She gripped harder as he took her deep. The slap of the water in the tub, the visual image of him claiming her from behind, the relentless pull of orgasm, all rose and mixed together in an inferno. His dark eyes turned savage as he met hers in the mirror. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Carina. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>He reached between her legs. Thrust again.</p><p>She came.</p><p>Carina bucked beneath him and let herself soar. The clench and release of muscles; the exquisite pain/pleasure of tight nipples and pounding clit; all sensations dragged her into a new world she\u2019d never experienced. Her fingers grabbed onto the slippery surface of the tub as her body tried to find footing and she wondered if he wrecked her for life.</p><p>How many years had she spent dreaming of something she could never have imagined? Those polite kisses with boys before him never reached her core. She\u2019d experienced flutters of arousal with caresses\u2014even experienced orgasms by the thrust of male talented fingers and her own. But Max reached way beyond any surface and dragged every dark fantasy she buried to life. He demanded more than polite responses. Sex was messy and sweaty and bursting with so many delicious contradictions she never realized existed.</p><p>She\u2019d never settle for anything less than this. Oh, the woman she could be with the right lover. A deep weariness settled over her and she relaxed against Max, drifting in pleasure for a while.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>One bath and a shared bottle of water later, she sat naked in his lap on the elegant lounge chair. A fire crackled and a blanket wrapped them in a cocoon of warmth. Carina rested her head against his shoulder and sighed. The hushed silence wove a sense of closeness and connection between them. Carina spoke in a low voice. \u201cI think I want to quit La Dolce Maggie.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hands soothingly over her back. \u201cTalk to me. Is this about your earlier mistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more than that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m happy anymore.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cBecause of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you idiot. Because of me. I don\u2019t know if I belong in the business world. I wanted to want it. Just because I\u2019m good at crunching numbers doesn\u2019t mean I want to do that day after day. I hate cubicles and sales and spreadsheets. I don\u2019t have the killer instinct like you and Julietta.\u201d</p> <p>He blew out a breath. It was a while before he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Michael is going to accept your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I haven\u2019t made my final decision yet. I\u2019ll give it some more time and be honest with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do instead?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and snuggled closer. \u201cNot sure. Get back to my painting and get serious. Find a way to combine what I\u2019m good at with something more creative. I\u2019m not afraid to find out anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll back you either way, Carina. I think you do a hell of a job at La Dolce Maggie. But you need to be happy\u2014you deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d A pang of loss settled over her. She finally felt like she truly belonged with someone who understood her, but her one precious night was almost up. Time ticked steadily. Soon, dawn would break over the horizon and drag her back to reality. She already knew they had no future. Even if they were able to overcome Michael, Max made it quite clear he was not interested in committing to a relationship, especially with her. He stayed safely behind the barriers built since childhood, and cited age, family, and a bunch of other obstacles in order to rationalize his decision. She hated it but refused to fight. She deserved someone who wanted her enough to overcome the odds. Carina ignored the empty feeling inside and swore to get over it.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever talk about your dad?\u201d</p><p>His hand paused on her back. She waited him out. After a few beats, he resumed the caress. \u201cBecause it still hurts.\u201d</p><p>The raw honesty shuddered through her. She lifted her head and cupped his cheek. \u201cI know he left after you were born. I know he was Swiss, very rich, and swept your mother off her feet in an old-fashioned romance. But you never elaborated on your relationship . . . if you ever found him or had contact.\u201d</p><p>Carina knew she danced the line. Expected him to withdraw into his safe haven and give her a flip answer. He always avoided speaking about his past, and her mother and Michael never mentioned it, though Max had been part of their family.</p><p>He gave her the second gift of the evening.</p><p>\u201cI was twenty-one when I finally decided to track him down. All that time I just waited for something to happen. A card. Present. Note. I finally realized he was never going to contact me, so I decided to do it myself. A rich Swiss businessman who completely disappeared seemed odd. I always wondered if he\u2019d been involved in some scandal and wanted to protect me. I even thought he was dead.\u201d</p><p>Her heart shattered at his flat tone. She wrapped her arms around him for body warmth and listened.</p><p>\u201cI found him in London. He ended up just an old drunk who didn\u2019t give a shit. No exotic past or legitimate excuses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever speak with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He knew who I was when I saw him in the bar. And he didn\u2019t care. Never wanted me as a baby, and didn\u2019t give a shit that I grew up. He gave me money. He thought that should be enough.\u201d Carina wondered what it felt like to have your own blood deny you any part of their heritage or memories. No wonder he isolated himself so much. No wonder he never wanted to take a chance on anything permanent. \u201cBut I was finally able to let it go. I was tired of living my life for a ghost that never really was. I left London the next day and never looked back.\u201d</p><p>They both knew it was a lie. Everyone looked back. But for now, she allowed him the space.</p><p>\u201cI think your mom forgave him. I think your mom still even loves him in some way.\u201d</p><p>He craned his neck and looked down at her. \u201cNo. Mama never mentions him. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>She reached up and tangled her fingers in his hair. \u201cBecause he gave her you. And you were worth everything, Maximus Gray.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes\u2014an emotion she never spotted before. A tenderness that spread over her like honey and melted every part of her body.</p><p>She pressed her mouth to his. With a low groan, he slid his tongue inside and thrust deep. She linked her ankle over his calf and shifted her weight. He stirred to life.</p><p>\u201cDamn, one day you\u2019re going to make someone a great husband.\u201d The words popped out of her mouth and she cursed. \u201cAh, crap, you know what I mean. Don\u2019t get your ego in a tangle. This is just about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for reminding me of my use and purpose.\u201d Her fingers drifted, wrapping around his penis and playing. He groaned and allowed her free access, until his erection throbbed in her hand and power pumped through her veins. \u201cBaby, you\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>She slid down his body, straddled him, and lowered her mouth. Then smiled. \u201cNot yet, but I will.\u201d</p><p>She took him fully in and closed her lips around his shaft. The scent and flavor of him urged her on, and she spent long minutes enjoying giving him pleasure. Harsh expletives shot from his mouth and made her even hotter. He reared up and grabbed her before she could protest. \u201cCondom,\u201d he hissed out. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Carina fumbled but got it on in seconds. With one quick motion, he lifted her up and over.</p><p>He filled her and pushed every other thought out of her mind but how she could take more of him. Tilting her hips, she set the motion, until he couldn\u2019t wait any longer and took control. She rode him in a furious frenzy until they both came apart together. She slumped over him in a big melty pool of satisfaction and wondered if she\u2019d ever walk again. Or do anything again without thinking about Maximus Gray.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you learn to do that?\u201d</p><p>She tamped down a giggle at the cranky tone, though his body seemed happily satisfied. \u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on orgasm number ten. We\u2019re past embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA banana.\u201d</p><p>Instead of laughing, he waggled a brow. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed with delight and realized she may just still be almost in love with Max.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She bit down on the sudden surge of emotion. No, she\u2019d never admit or express such words again, not since that night she\u2019d burned the love spell and dreamed of marrying the man she loved with her heart and mind and soul.</p><p>Instead, she said nothing. Just kissed his face and held him close. And waited for dawn.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>He\u2019d left the blinds open.</p><p>The weak light of morning pierced through and reminded him the night was officially over. He glanced over at the woman beside him. She slept deeply, her cute little snores confirming her exhaustion. What the hell was he going to do?</p><p>Leave her a note? Bring her coffee? Discuss the night? Remain silent? The endless options stretched before him and as a man, he was already guaranteed to pick the wrong one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her rich hair spread out on the pillow like a dark angel, and he spotted the telltale signs of stubble burn over her cheeks and neck. Her lips looked puffy and bruised. A sliver of guilt pierced through him. Had he used her too hard and too well? He never thought of her as a virgin. Every motion confirmed her open, raw sexuality. She was a wet dream come true\u2014a purist with the body and soul of a seductress. In bed she exhibited a naked truth that confirmed she gave all of herself. Just like in her life.</p><p>Such a priceless, rare gift. One he wasn\u2019t worthy of. One he\u2019d never ask her to give to him again.</p><p>An empty grief roared through him but he refused to examine the emotion. Maybe he\u2019d shower, get dressed, and bring her coffee. He\u2019d confirm how much she meant to him; how much the endless hours of making love changed him forever. Then explain once again why they needed to end it.</p><p>Unless . . .</p> <p>The possibility swarmed before him. What if they continued the relationship? Carina in his bed. Taking her to dinner. Seducing her out of that proper business suit. Working side by side. Maybe it could work. Maybe . . .</p><p>Michael Conte and his family inspired him to make the most out of himself. When his father walked, Max needed to build something he could count on. His word. His honor. His trust. This meant everything to him, and defined who he was as a man. If Michael discovered he\u2019d slept with Carina, he may never get that trust back, and it could break him.</p><p>He\u2019d never let that happen.</p><p>And what could he possibly offer? He didn\u2019t have the emotional capacity to give her what she deserved. One day she\u2019d ask for a ring. Children. A life of permanent commitment. All he could give was the moment\u2014good sex, companionship, respect. Eventually, she\u2019d tire of his crap and move on. Even worse, what if he did something to hurt her? He made the vow long ago to never use any actions to hurt a woman\u2019s heart. It was too damn delicate, and he didn\u2019t want the responsibility.</p><p>She was extraordinary in every aspect, and completely beyond him.</p> <p>Decision made, he slid out of bed and headed toward the bathroom.</p><p>The knock on the door surprised him. Max strained his ears, but another light tapping echoed in the room. Damn, it wasn\u2019t even 6 a.m. Not wanting to wake Carina, he put on boxers and opened the door.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.</p><p>Mama Conte stood in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMaximus?\u201d Her confused expression registered in slow motion. As if trapped in a disaster movie, the rest of the events rolled slowly in time and had a strange surreal quality. Carina\u2019s mother squinted at the number on the door and back at the piece of paper she clutched in her hand. \u201cI knew you were in Vegas also, but this is Carina\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Max ignored his rapidly beating heart and gave her a big hug. \u201cMama Conte, what a pleasant surprise. Nope, this is my room, but let me get dressed and I\u2019ll meet you right outside and show you where Carina is.\u201d</p> <p>He almost won.</p><p>She threw back her head and cackled. \u201cSilly man, your underwear doesn\u2019t offend me.\u201d She neatly sidestepped him and took a few steps into the room. Removed her cardigan. \u201cUsed to run bare-butt naked in my house the whole summer.\u201d Walked over to lay her sweater on the back of the couch. \u201cGo ahead and change.\u201d</p><p>She tripped over a high-heeled shoe. Stared at the zigzag trail of clothing. Ventured farther into the suite toward the open French doors of the bedroom.</p><p>His gaze followed hers. A pair of lacy garters. A scrap of thong. His dress shirt.</p><p>He opened his mouth to stop her but she stopped right before the bedroom. The low snore grew louder and turned into a rough grunt. A tumble of dark curls contrasted with the stark white of the sheet. Slowly, Mama Conte walked over to the bed and stared at her daughter.</p><p>Naked.</p><p>Suddenly, the film went into crazy action and he snapped. He jumped in front of the bed and put out his hands to ward off a batty mommy attack. \u201cOh, Dio mio, Mama Conte, it\u2019s not what you think. Well, it\u2019s what you think, but you weren\u2019t supposed to see it. Oh, Dio, I am sorry, so sorry.\u201d His babbling grew until he realized he\u2019d just reverted back to his youth.</p><p>Dark eyes flew to his face, trying to make sense of the scene. Moments passed. Finally, she nodded as if she\u2019d made her decision. \u201cBring me to your room, Maximus. Now. We need to talk.\u201d She walked to the door. \u201cYou have one minute to change and get out here. And don\u2019t wake up Carina.\u201d</p> <p>The door shut behind her.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Max tunneled his fingers through his hair and settled into hell.</p><p>Sweat broke out over his skin. His mama\u2019s best friend and his secondary caregiver sat before him, deep in thought. She hadn\u2019t spoken since they arrived in his room. Just directed him to the chair and let him stew in his own perspiration for the next ten minutes. Having raised four children and buried a husband, her slight figure was lean but strong. With her own talent and hard work, she\u2019d built La Dolce Famiglia from a home-based pastry shop into one of the biggest chains in Italy. Her gray hair was twisted into a bun at the back of her head and showed off both the grace and carved lines in her face. Her cane leaned against the wall. She wore orthopedic shoes now, with thick laces and soles to help her walk.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d never been so fucking scared of a little old lady in his whole life.</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>His voice almost shook but he stumbled through. \u201cJust one night. We hoped no one would ever know about it. We never wanted to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her brows knit together. \u201cDid you plan for this to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No, we both knew a relationship wouldn\u2019t be good for one another. There was an attraction, of course, but I thought we had it under control. Carina lost her temper at me and Sawyer Wells started to go after her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSawyer Wells is here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, he runs the Venetian now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Sawyer and I got in a fight over Carina, and then things got out of hand, and I\u2019m so sorry. I will do anything you ask to make this right.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and patted his hand. A slight smile curved her thin lips. \u201cYes, Maximus, I know. You were always a good boy. A little wild, but a good heart. Michael will be upset, but we will make him understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll kill me,\u201d Max groaned.</p><p>\u201cNonsense, I won\u2019t let him kill you. Arrangements have to be made fast, though. Too late to fly your mama here, but you\u2019ll do what Michael did. Have a nice garden wedding in Bergamo later on this year.\u201d</p><p>His inner alarm ratcheted up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call home and explain you wanted to elope. The opportunity Vegas affords is priceless. Why, people do weddings here all the time and very nice ones, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Wedding?</p><p>\u201cBy this afternoon, you can fill out the paperwork and pick the chapel. I have to fly to New York tomorrow anyway. Michael was quite annoyed I insisted on stopping in Vegas before going to New York, but I\u2019ve always wanted to see such a city. Do you know if that singer Celine Dion is in town?\u201d</p><p>Max stared at her. What wedding? Why were they talking about Celine Dion? If he\u2019d stuck with the plan, he would\u2019ve taken Carina to the damn concert, dropped her off at the room, and they never would be in this mess. But the thought of never touching her skin or making her come seemed overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cYou are doing the right thing. The moral thing. It will all work out.\u201d</p><p>The full implication of Mama Conte\u2019s words slammed through him. The room tilted. Spun. Steadied.</p><p>She expected him to marry Carina.</p><p>His breath caught him in a choke hold. \u201cWait a minute. I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d Mama Conte tilted her head to the side. \u201cYes, we spent the night together, but this isn\u2019t Italy. In America, sometimes these things happen, and the relationship isn\u2019t pursued.\u201d He laughed. The sound seemed half crazed, like a manic supervillain. \u201cOf course, we\u2019ll remain friends and close, but we can\u2019t marry each other.\u201d</p><p>Carina\u2019s mother stiffened. Ice drizzled over her features and stopped his heart. \u201cWhy not, Maximus?\u201d</p><p>Shit, shit, shit, shit . . .</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not good enough for Carina! I work crazy hours, I\u2019m unstable, and she needs to find herself. She\u2019d feel trapped with me, I\u2019m sure, and she needs a man who wants to settle down and take care of her and have babies. Someone better suited. Someone not me.\u201d</p><p>An eerie silence settled over the room. Panic clawed at his gut. There was no way he could marry Carina. He\u2019d ruin her life and break her heart. He didn\u2019t do long term. He didn\u2019t do commitment.</p><p>Mama Conte reached over, took his hand, and squeezed. Her delicate fingers gripped him with urgency. \u201cYou are wrong. You are perfect for Carina, and always were. Your actions last night only fast-forwarded what was meant to be from the beginning.\u201d The older woman smiled. \u201cNow, no more nonsense. You are part of the family and always have been. No silly talk about ruining her. It is time you settle down with a woman who can be what you need, who is your match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you disappoint your mother because you are suddenly afraid?\u201d Her steely tone cut through the fog and to the heart of the problem. His mama would never hold her head up again if news got out he slept with Carina and didn\u2019t marry her. It would ruin her reputation and everything they worked so hard to build. A sense of trust, and honor, and home. He\u2019d be doing exactly what his father did. Abandoning his responsibility. Humiliating his mother all over again in the small town that had finally forgiven her. Yes, no one married just because they had sex, but once everyone found out what happened, a major fallout would occur. He\u2019d drag his family and Carina down into the pits. She\u2019d never feel free to go home again. And he\u2019d never be able to look his mama straight in the eye.</p><p>The only option crystallized like spun glass. Marriage. He needed to marry Carina. It was the only way to make things right. His honor demanded it, and it was all he had left.</p><p>A strange calm settled over him. He\u2019d tasted her forbidden fruit and now needed to claim her permanently. She was going to be his wife, and there was nothing left to do.</p><p>By stepping up, he\u2019d finally become a permanent part of the family he always loved. But at what price? What type of husband could he possibly make for Carina? He\u2019d never be worthy, but could he be enough to prove he\u2019d never be like his father?</p><p>He had to be.</p><p>Grateful that he wasn\u2019t experiencing a breakdown, he nodded and made his choice. \u201cYes. But let me do this my way. Carina will refuse to marry me if she thinks we\u2019re bullying her into it. You know how stubborn she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right. Go in and ask her. Make her happy. That is all that matters.\u201d</p><p>Her words shook him to the core. Flutters of panic tickled his nerve endings. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She reached out and cupped both of his cheeks between her weathered hands. Dark eyes held a knowledge and peace he clung to. \u201cDo you think I would let Carina marry anyone not worthy of her? You need to trust yourself more, Maximus. Trust you are enough and nothing like the man who left you. I\u2019ve watched you grow up, and I\u2019m proud of you. Of your choices and the way you took care of your mother.\u201d She pinched one cheek like he was a toddler. \u201cBe the man and husband I know you can, my sweet boy. Take this gift.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shuddered and fought for composure. Any words of protest died in his throat.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019ll go downstairs and get some breakfast. Come get me when you are ready.\u201d</p><p>He watched the older woman leave and dragged in a lungful of air. Waited a beat. Then went to wake up his future wife.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Carina heard the voice in the background, but she was pleasantly buzzed and relaxed with the endorphins of hours of fabulous sex. She moaned into the plump pillow and stretched. Max\u2019s voice grew louder, so she finally rolled over.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>His voice was deep, sexy, and matched his morning-after look. Tousled hair fell in disarray over his forehead. Shocking blue eyes gleamed with a mix of emotions she couldn\u2019t place, so instead she tugged him forward and kissed those carved lips. His rough stubble contrasted deliciously with her sensitive skin. It took him a moment of hesitation, as if he wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. Then he dove full force.</p><p>He pressed her back into the mattress and kissed her like a proper lover. Deep thrusts of his tongue and full-body contact. He tasted of hot male arousal and a hint of her essence, from the endless hours of lovemaking. Finally, he pulled away and smiled down at her.</p><p>\u201cYour greeting was better.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and stroked his cheek. \u201cI agree. Where\u2019s my coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing. I got distracted. Wanted to ask you something first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Her heart fell apart but she knew what was coming. And desperately wanted to do it first. \u201cWe\u2019ll sip coffee, get dressed, and never mention last night. I don\u2019t want you to worry, Max. This is what I wanted, and I can handle it.\u201d She forced a half laugh. \u201cFeels nice to be the jaded American woman for a change. Using a male for her physical pleasure and tossing him aside. Another fantasy checked off my list.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, she didn\u2019t spot any relief in his eyes. Instead, he pulled back and sat on the edge of the mattress. Examined her bare leg and refused to meet her gaze. \u201cThe rules have changed, Carina. At least for me.\u201d</p><p>Confusion swamped her. She sat up and pushed her tangled mane of hair from her face. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. Looked up. \u201cI want you to marry me.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked. \u201cAre you nuts?\u201d</p><p>His hand shook as he rubbed his forehead. Was he nervous? Had he gone off some deep end because he screwed his best friend\u2019s little sister? \u201cOnly you would ask such a question after a marriage proposal. No, I\u2019m perfectly sane. I don\u2019t want to pretend nothing happened between us. We\u2019re in Vegas. We\u2019re meant to be together. Let\u2019s get married.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed most of her life of such words coming from this man\u2019s lips. Wasn\u2019t it every woman\u2019s fantasy to hear a man propose after a night of endless pleasure? The perfect ending to every romantic comedy and romance novel. So, why wasn\u2019t she launching herself into his arms screaming \u201cyes\u201d?</p><p>Because her instincts warned something was off. Why the sudden turnaround? How could he have gone from no commitment to marriage in less than twenty-four hours? She ignored her babbling younger self who whispered she didn\u2019t care, and listened instead to the older, wiser Carina. \u201cUmm, I\u2019m flattered, truly. But if you\u2019re so intent on not hiding our relationship, why don\u2019t we just date?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Hard. \u201cI don\u2019t want to date.\u201d His aura pulsed with male power and domination, urging her to submit. Damn, his controlling tendencies turned her on. Who would\u2019ve thought? \u201cI\u2019ve waited my whole life to be sure, and I don\u2019t want to wait any longer. You always said you had feelings for me. Let\u2019s do this. Let\u2019s get married and start a life together.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s do this?</p><p>She swallowed and tried to speak past her pounding heart. \u201cWhy the sudden change? We had rules in place. One night and move on. You said you didn\u2019t want to settle down. You cited the age difference, Michael, my family, your wanderlust. What\u2019s going on, Max?\u201d</p><p>In seconds, he loomed over her and took her mouth. Holding her head, he claimed her lips and plundered every corner, until she hung on and dug her nails into his shoulders. She shuddered in pure lust and softened beneath him. He broke contact and gazed deep into her eyes. Raw command glimmered and tempted. \u201cI changed my mind. I want you, all the way, all the time. Don\u2019t make me beg. Just tell me you\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p> <p>She opened her mouth to say yes. Why not? She\u2019d spent the most incredible night of her life with a man she\u2019d always longed for. They were in Vegas where crazy things happened and impromptu weddings were the norm. Maybe he\u2019d discovered in the hours of the night he loved her? After all, wasn\u2019t that the only reason he\u2019d want to marry her?</p><p>Unless . . .</p><p>Her gut twisted with a knowledge she didn\u2019t want to probe. But this was the new Carina, and she wasn\u2019t stupid enough to just believe Max Gray suddenly got bit by the love bug enough to give up his freedom.</p><p>She pushed him away and sat up. Studied him with hard eyes. Determination carved out the lines of his face like he faced a business deal he needed to close. Carina followed her instincts and tested him.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the offer, Max, but I like things the way they are. Let\u2019s just see where this leads. No need to rush into marriage after one crazy night.\u201d</p><p>A flare of panic gleamed in those baby blues. His jaw clenched. \u201cAre you listening to me? I\u2019m asking you to marry me! I\u2019m saying you\u2019re The One, and I want to do this right now, today. Let\u2019s get crazy and say our vows in Vegas. We were always meant to be together and I\u2019ve finally realized it.\u201d</p><p>He bent forward and she knew he\u2019d seduce her. Wring the yes from her lips and her heart before she had time to seriously wonder what was going on. For her own survival, she scrambled back on the bed and put her arms out in an effort to ward him off.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands in surrender. \u201cWhy not now? Last night proved you were The One.\u201d</p><p>A cold ball of misery fisted in her gut. He lied. His muscles tensed as if preparing for a boxing round. A wall of distance sprung up around him. Completely contradictory to the relaxed languor of a man with the woman he loves, he began pacing, another sign of nervousness.</p><p>What was she missing? This wasn\u2019t just about guilt. This was sheer panic, as if trapped into . . .</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>Carina swallowed past the lump in her throat. \u201cWho found out?\u201d</p><p>He froze. Pushed his fingers through his hair. Paced some more. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I just asked you to marry me and I\u2019m being questioned like a prisoner of war. Excuse me if I\u2019m a bit confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael? Did he call the hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Listen, I don\u2019t want to go back home and date. I want to make this a permanent relationship. Live with you, sleep with you, work with you. This is the right thing to do, baby.\u201d</p><p>The right thing to do.</p><p>She wrapped the sheet firmly around her naked breasts and fought for sanity. Her fingers shook but she managed to force the words out. \u201cTell me the truth, Max. Right now, or I swear to God, I will completely lose it. You owe me that.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, but the muscles in his bare back turned rigid. A vicious curse escaped his lips, and finally, he faced her. \u201cYour mother is here. She came into the room this morning and found us.\u201d</p><p>Carina gasped and shook her head. \u201cDio, no. What is she doing here? How did she even know where to find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to stop and see you before flying to your brother\u2019s house. Michael gave her the room number.\u201d</p><p>Her brain turned numb with the awful possibilities. No wonder he\u2019d proposed. If her mother pushed him to be honorable, Max buckled immediately under the guise of honor. Rage and humiliation twisted in her gut. She couldn\u2019t even have a decent one-night stand properly. What other woman engaged in raw, dirty sex and had to face her mother\u2019s wrath the next morning? Her skin turned clammy with nerves, and she wished desperately for clothes and solitude. Instead, she made herself speak. \u201cNow I understand.\u201d Her laugh rang hollow through the silent room. \u201cNothing like an overprotective mama to spur on a proposal. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of it. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go down and speak with her. Clear up the whole mess. Can you give me a few minutes to get dressed, please?\u201d</p><p>He walked over and knelt beside the bed. Her heart wobbled between pure emotion and betrayal at his stony expression. How easily he tried to woo her with false endearments that meant nothing. Did he really believe she was so stupid to jump into marriage out of gratitude? Did he still think so little of her?</p><p>\u201cWe have to get married, Carina.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cHell, no. We don\u2019t have to get married. I\u2019m in America now, and just because we had sex doesn\u2019t mean we have to make it legal. I don\u2019t even want to marry you!\u201d</p><p>Max jerked back but remained intractable. \u201cYour mother will not accept anything less. Your family is going to find out and it will ruin your reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, my reputation needed a bit of color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny. My mother will also know, and it will break her heart.\u201d</p><p>A rage of emotions shook her body. Damn him. Carina squeezed her eyes shut and prayed she\u2019d wake up out of the nightmare. \u201cShe\u2019ll get over it. We\u2019ll make them understand. It will not affect our lives back in Bergamo or here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that to her. I can\u2019t let her believe I turned my back on everything I value. We have no other choice.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew back open. \u201cHell, yes, we have another choice. I need you to go, Max. Please. Let me go see my mother, and I promise I\u2019ll clear the whole thing up. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He studied her in the morning light and slowly nodded. With graceful movements, he moved away from the bed. His last words drifted to her ear in warning.</p><p>\u201cGo see her. But I already know it will not make a difference.\u201d</p><p>The adjoining door shut. Fighting raw panic, Carina jumped from the bed and flung some clothes on. Her sore muscles screamed in agony as she pulled on a pair of jeans, donned a black tank top, and twisted her hair in a knot. Shoving a pair of flip-flops on her feet, she brushed her teeth and headed down to the buffet.</p><p>The elegant dining room held wide archways and soaring open windows. She walked through the main floor as the endless tables boasted steaming platters of breakfast and lunch foods to satisfy any appetite or fancy. Chefs with white hats nodded to her as she walked past and searched for her mother. Finally, her gaze snagged on an elderly woman alone on the balcony, with three plates of food in front of her. The heavily carved walking cane lay beside the table.</p><p>Her heart tugged at the familiar face she had counted on her entire life. Mama Conte beamed up at her and pulled her down for a kiss. She smelled of sweet maple syrup and cinnamon toast. \u201cMy dearest Carina, I have never seen such food in my life. Or such a fake, beautiful Grand Canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Mama.\u201d She took the seat across from her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wanted to stop and see you before flying to Michael\u2019s house. Also wanted to see this famous Vegas. Who would\u2019ve known such glamour existed in the heart of the desert, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Hopefully I\u2019ll get to show you around. But I have some exciting news for you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax and I are getting married.\u201d</p> <p>Carina handed it to her mama. The woman was a practiced poker player. Her face lit up and she clapped her hands together in pretend joy. \u201cNo! I did not realize you and Max were seeing each other. I am so happy, my dear. Wait till I tell your sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we wait to marry in Italy or get married here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, definitely here. Look at this place\u2014it is a perfect place for a wedding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, stop it.\u201d</p><p>The older woman never flinched. Just stared at her with those steady dark eyes without a shred of remorse. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know what happened, Mama. You found out Max and I slept together and you forced Max to ask me to marry him. How could you? How could you force a man to take me on like some kind of responsibility?\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte sighed and pushed away her plate. She took her time and sipped at the strong espresso. \u201cI did not mean to deceive you, Carina. I thought it would be more romantic if Max asked you without you believing it had anything to do with me.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cIt has everything to do with you. Let me try to explain. Max and I spent the night together, but we don\u2019t want a long-term relationship. We\u2019re not right for one another. By threatening him with honor, you\u2019re forcing him to make a choice he does not want. We can work this out. If you keep the whole thing to yourself, no one ever has to know. No one will get hurt.\u201d</p><p>The woman who raised four children and built an empire narrowed her gaze and leaned in. Carina trembled under her dictating stare. \u201cYou do not understand. You slept with Max. I have not raised you or Maximus to run away from your responsibilities. Just because you come to America does not mean you lose your values. This must be made right.\u201d</p><p>Carina\u2019s heart beat so loud the sound roared in her ears. She breathed deeply and tried to treat it as a business deal she had to win at any cost. Unfortunately, her mother was the strongest opposition she\u2019d ever faced. \u201cMama, I never meant to hurt you, but this is my life now. I cannot marry Max. You must understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause! Because we don\u2019t care for each other like that. Because when two people have sex it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a lifetime commitment.\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte nodded and crossed her arms in front of her. Her voice turned cold. \u201cI see. Then you must answer me one question. If you are willing to hurt me and mock everything I did to raise you, every ethic and moral Papa and I believed in, you must promise to tell me the truth when I ask you this.\u201d</p><p>Shame flooded her. Carina clenched her fingers and nodded. \u201cI promise. Ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook me in the eye, Carina Conte, and tell me you honestly do not love Max.\u201d</p><p>The breath whooshed out of her body like she\u2019d been clubbed. Carina stared at her mother with a combination of horror and relief. Just say the words. Tell her very simply she did not love Max and she\u2019d be off the hook. Sure, there\u2019s be guilt, and her mother would be disappointed, but there would be no forced marriage. No false relationship or phony vows of affection they both didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>I. Don\u2019t. Love. Max.</p><p>She opened her mouth.</p><p>The years of growing up under her mother\u2019s care flashed before her. After Papa died, her world collapsed on its foundation and it was hard to find her footing. Michael helped. But her mother was the rock that held it all together. An iron fist and a heart that beat pure gold, she stood beside her every night while she cried and told her stories of Papa, never afraid to talk about the man who was her lifetime love. She moved through her grief with honesty and a courage Carina swore she\u2019d duplicate in honor of her mother.</p> <p>As the words formed on her tongue, her heart screamed her a liar, and for a moment, she reached a turning point.</p><p>Her mother waited. Trusting she\u2019d tell the truth. Trusting her to be real with herself and never act the coward.</p><p>She still loved Max.</p><p>The realization slammed her back. Grief and hopelessness flooded her body like a tsunami hell-bent on destruction.</p><p>Her voice broke. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her mother reached over and took her hand and squeezed it. \u201cI know. You have always loved him. Knowing this, I must enforce this marriage, and you must try and find your way. Max has deep feelings for you, my sweet Carina. I will not allow him to deny himself or your chance. If you do not agree to this, I will call Max\u2019s mother. I will tell Michael everything, and you will do more damage than you can ever know. Because you will break my heart.\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened and suddenly, she was completely drained. The fight slid from her muscles and she slumped on the chair. Like a child, she wanted to cry and crawl into her mother\u2019s lap for comfort. But she was grown now, and had to face her own consequences and decisions.</p><p>There was no longer a choice.</p><p>She had to marry Max.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina knocked on his door.</p><p>Her weak heart exploded with lust and something deeper when he answered and stepped aside. Thank God he\u2019d put on some clothes, but barely. The blue sweat shorts hung low and showed his washboard stomach. The matching T-shirt seemed old as dirt, and the worn fabric clung to his shoulders and chest like a lover.</p><p>She fought the impulse to lean in and drag in a breath of his scent\u2014a mixture of soap, coffee, and a hint of musk. He\u2019d showered and his hair was damp and neatly tamed back from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d One bare foot was propped up on the other while he faced her.</p><p>\u201cYou were right. She wants us to get married.\u201d</p><p>Carina waited for a vicious curse. A full-fledged panic attack. Anything to give her an excuse to break her mother\u2019s heart and take the punishment. Instead, he nodded as if he already knew. \u201cI figured. You want coffee?\u201d He gestured toward the table set from room service. Silver domes lifted to reveal scrambled eggs and toast, and a full pot of coffee sat beside a vase with a single long-stemmed rose.</p><p>Her temper exploded. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want any goddamn coffee! And I don\u2019t want a husband who doesn\u2019t want me, either. Do you really want to do this? Do you want to be trapped in a permanent relationship you didn\u2019t even choose?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his cup and studied her. His face reminded her of a mask, completely devoid of any emotion. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sipped the steaming brew. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Fury broke loose within and unleashed. \u201cFuck you, Max. I\u2019ll marry you, but I won\u2019t be your little puppet. Just remember I never asked for this. I don\u2019t need your pity, or good intentions. I had my one perfect night and I don\u2019t need another.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the door behind her.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The day passed in a blur.</p><p>The La Capella chapel was a Tuscan-inspired space that fit perfectly. The rich earth tones, highly polished marble floors, and mahogany pews reminded her of home. Carina donned the simple white floor-length Vera Wang dress with numb fingers. Her mother fussed over her hair as if it were a real wedding, twisting the unruly strands into shiny fat curls. When she placed the pearl-crusted veil on her head and covered her face with the white film, no one saw the tears that sprung to her eyes.</p><p>She always imagined her giggling sisters around her and walking down the aisle to a man who loved her. Instead, she paused in the doorway and finally understood how her sister-in-law felt trying to conquer her panic attacks. Her stomach lurched, and perspiration broke out on her skin, making her itch.</p><p>Cheesy organ music drifted in the air, and Carina took a step back in her Ciccotti shoes, which had four-inch heels, real diamonds, and urged her to run. Hell, she\u2019d be the runaway bride. Find a FedEx truck and hitch it out on a grand adventure. Change her name, go under deep cover and\u2014</p><p>Her gaze slammed into his.</p><p>His whole aura screamed control. Piercing ocean blue eyes held hers and gave her the strength needed to drag in a breath. Another one. Her mother linked her arm firmly within hers, lifted her cane, and began the long walk down the aisle.</p><p>Never breaking his stare, he willed her to complete the walk until she stood before him at the altar. He was male perfection. Dressed in a crisp black tuxedo, with red accents and a rose in his lapel, he exhibited a lean grace and elegance.</p><p>He recited his vows in a voice that never shook. The seriousness of the moment conflicted with the impulse of her decision. Somehow, it didn\u2019t seem real until she said the words. Her tongue stuck on the answer. Could she really do this? Marry a man who didn\u2019t love her? The questions whirled and wreaked havoc with her head. A halting silence rushed over the chapel. Her mother tilted her head and waited. The blood roared in her ears, and she swayed on her feet.</p><p>Slight pressure from his fingers tapped her back. Slowly, he nodded. Encouraging her to say the words. Demanding she take the leap.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He slid the three-carat crown-of-light diamond onto her finger.</p><p>Claimed.</p><p>His lips were warm but his kiss was chaste. A formal ending to a ceremony that would change them forever.</p><p>Sawyer gave them a private dining room. A popular band played old Italian favorites, and they feasted on pasta, wine, and various appetizers. The cake was personally created by the Venetian\u2019s pastry chef in honor of the wedding.</p><p>The next few hours unfolded for her as if she was outside herself. She smiled when necessary. Made calls to Max\u2019s mother and her family to break the news. She forced squeals of happiness with her sisters, and painted a scene of their secret courtship that made her choke. All the while, Max never touched her. He barely glanced at her as they performed the mandatory dance. She guzzled champagne in an effort to forget until they finally made it to their room.</p><p>The king-size bed mocked her. Their lovemaking still clung in the air, or maybe it was just her imagination. He stood in front of her, dressed in his impeccable tuxedo, all his gorgeousness and grace so close yet galaxies away. Her body caved and melted under the sudden heat of his stare. \u201cIt is our honeymoon night.\u201d</p><p>She imagined him stripping off her wedding dress and panties. Parting her thighs. Dipping his head to suck and lick until he finally pushed deep inside and made her forget everything except the way he made her feel.</p><p>She grabbed the bottle of champagne chilling in the holder and a glass. Kicked off her shoes. And smiled mockingly.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to us, Maxie. Good night.\u201d</p><p>In a fit of temper, she saluted and sauntered away with the champagne. Closed the door and locked it. Slumped against the wall in her wedding dress.</p><p>And cried.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Two weeks later, Max realized his life was different.</p><p>Max enjoyed order and simplicity. His bedroom reflected his lifestyle, full of cherrywood furniture and spartan decorations. Now, the darkness exploded with touches of light\u2014a tangerine throw rug over hardwood floors, a frilly pink scarf hung on the hook behind the door, the spill of glass bottles with fragrance and a clutter of shoes clustered in the corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His private bath now smelled of cucumber, melon, and fresh soap. His razor had been moved from the cabinet and was replaced by bottles of lotion and creams. As he made his way down the spiral staircase and into the living room, he noticed a few celebrity magazines lying on the sofa next to an array of romance novels with sexy covers. Max scooped one up to move it into the bookcase, but decided to peek. After he read the scene, he wondered why his face felt suddenly hot. He quickly shelved it and walked into the culinary kitchen.</p><p>Empty, except for the spill of bread crumbs on the white granite counter like a little mouse. He followed the trail down the hall and toward the back. She had claimed the sunroom as her new workspace and seemed to spend endless hours here. Max tapped on the door and opened it.</p><p>She stood in the spill of light in the center of the room, staring at a blank canvas. He rarely used the space other than for storage, but she descended in a whirl of organization. Boxes disappeared, shaded blinds were ripped down, and the wallpaper torn off. Now, new life breathed into an artist\u2019s haven with sun streaming through the bay windows and onto rich peachy walls, and endless storage shelves filled with supplies. He\u2019d hooked up the music system, and Beyonc\u00e9 ground out sexy lyrics at high volume.</p><p>Carina\u2019s fingers gripped a paintbrush dipped in moss green, and her smock already held touches of color and the smear of charcoal. Basic sketches filled the walls with a variety of figures, and she\u2019d tried her hand at a landscape that she abandoned halfway through. Her hair was pinned up on her head in a messy tangle. She pursed her lips in concentration, seeing something not there yet, an image she wanted to reveal, and Max was fascinated by this woman he\u2019d never glimpsed before. Rocky lay in a pool of sunshine by the window, snoring away. Man\u2019s best friend had quickly gone to the dark side. Her animal whisperer tendencies hypnotized the dog completely, and he followed her faithfully from room to room, confirming his new number one choice.</p> <p>In a matter of two weeks, she\u2019d upended his life. She was a bit messy with her clutter. She left the cap off the toothpaste, her shoes kicked off by the door, and never seemed to reach the hamper with her dunk shot.</p><p>He discovered she shared his passion for forensic crime dramas and the occasional trashy reality disaster. Sometimes they\u2019d sit together with Rocky beside them, drink wine, and watch television in blissful silence. The four-star meals he loved to experiment with finally had another participant, and he noticed more pleasure in creating dishes for her.</p><p>Of course, he kept waiting for panic to hit with the knowledge that his old life was over and he was tied down to one woman forever. He figured he\u2019d experience feelings of anger, resentment, or pure terror. But since that disastrous honeymoon night when she threw back his words in fury, he\u2019d kept his distance. They reached a tentative truce and treated each other with the utmost politeness and respect. Max told himself he was relieved she wasn\u2019t pushing him into false intimacies. He never expected her to be so resentful of the marriage, either. She didn\u2019t need him anymore in any type of capacity, obvious in her sudden focus on finding out if she wanted to continue working at La Dolce Maggie. She hadn\u2019t mentioned it lately, and since there\u2019d been no major mishaps, maybe Carina decided to stick it out.</p><p>\u201cCarina?\u201d</p><p>She spun around and his heart caught. With her hair loose and messy around her shoulders, a streak of charcoal on her cheek, and her smock splattered with paint, she looked different from her normal work self. Her cutoff shorts exposed a length of tanned leg, and cherry red toenails flashed on her bare feet. She scowled at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>He shifted his feet and suddenly felt like a teenage boy. \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d She crinkled her nose in that cute manner he began to spot. \u201cMy usual stuff isn\u2019t satisfying. I feel as if I\u2019m reaching for something more, but I\u2019m not sure what it is yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d She paused. \u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p><p>Christ, why did he feel like an idiot? Chasing after his own wife for some type of interaction. Max cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m making dinner. Thought you might want to take a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you save me a plate, please? Can\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Her absent sound and dismissal pissed him off. Why did she get to be cranky about being forced into marriage? He\u2019d sacrificed his life, too. \u201cAre you ready for our opening in two weeks? You\u2019ve done a good job prepping for it. Might have to work late for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>As if realizing she forgot to tell him something unimportant, she cut a hand through the air. \u201cOh, I forgot to tell you. I\u2019m quitting.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She pushed a hand through her curls and a flash of red paint speared random strands. \u201cSorry, I meant to tell you earlier. It\u2019s just not working for me any longer. I\u2019ll speak with Michael tomorrow. I\u2019ll stay as long as you need until you get a worthy assistant.\u201d</p><p>Shock held him motionless. When had she decided this? Since they arrived home from Vegas, she\u2019d continued to work at the office, but had cut back her hours. She completed her work to full capacity, but he knew her usual enthusiasm had diminished. His insides lurched at the idea of not seeing her in the office, but combined with a sense of pride. The image of their night together mocked him. Naked and in his arms, she confessed her emotions in a way that made him feel treasured. Now, she made her own decisions without a thought. A deep longing washed through him but he didn\u2019t know what to do about it. \u201cWhat are you going to do instead?\u201d</p><p>Carina grinned, her eyes lit with excitement. \u201cI\u2019m going to work in Alexa\u2019s store, BookCrazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting. I knew Alexa needed help with the second baby coming, but had no clue you\u2019d even been to the bookstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped by early in the week to give her some help. Her accountant sucks and really screwed things up. I told her I\u2019d take a look at her financials, but after working a few hours, I realized I love the place.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved his lips at her enthusiasm. She consistently surprised him with her ability to move from controlled executive to an openhearted woman full of life and love. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Bookstores are the perfect blend of business and creativity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! I\u2019m going to train with her for the next few weeks and give it a trial run.\u201d</p><p>Pride burst through him. \u201cYou\u2019ll rock it like you do everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other. He wanted to close the distance between them\u2014both physically and emotionally. After all, they were married for the long haul. Their connection during sex was earth-shattering. Why should they deny that part of their relationship?</p><p>Sensual awareness zinged to life, and she dragged in a breath. The tension twisted and he grew rock hard and ready to roll. The idea of tumbling her on top of that work desk and sinking into her wet heat made him want to stomp and snort like a stallion. He took a step forward, his eyes darkening with promise.</p><p>She turned her back on him. \u201cThanks for checking on me. Back to work.\u201d</p><p>Max smothered a curse at her obvious dismissal. How long was this going to last? Would she punish both of them because of a forced marriage? Perhaps he needed to show her what she was missing, how right they were for each other in bed.</p><p>Perhaps, it was time to seduce his wife.</p><p>He waited but she had already moved on and attacked the blankness with a few sharp strokes. He left her in the sunlight, alone, and wondered what he was going to do.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>What was she missing?</p><p>Carina peered at the image in front of her. Technically, the shadowing and structure were solid, but the unknown element was missing. The It factor.</p><p>She rotated her neck in tiny circles and glanced around. What time was it? The sun was long gone, and the last time Max checked on her had been around dinnertime. Her watch confirmed she\u2019d been painting for several hours.</p><p>Frustration nibbled on the edge of her nerves. It was hard plunging into the craft after several years of no practice. Her painting had been something she had had no time for once she committed to business school and had hoped a solid career path would still the inner voices that screamed for her to create.</p><p>Nope. The voices were back\u2014big-time. But now her skills were rusty and her usual profiles were flat. The art class she\u2019d finally signed up for helped reconnect with the basics needed to springboard off of. Between her new job at BookCrazy and her art, her life finally seemed to turn in the right direction. About time.</p><p>Except for her marriage mistake.</p><p>The memory of Max in her workroom burned behind her lids. All casual sexiness and steam concentrated full force. She\u2019d barely been able to turn around, but dismissal was crucial. If he believed she was his sweet little pup ready to beg at the first crook of his finger, he\u2019d learn the truth. Chasing him her whole life was exhausting. Time to regain her foundation and decide how she wanted to navigate this relationship\u2014this time on her terms.</p><p>Carina sighed and looked down at herself. Yuck. A complete mess. Rocky lifted his head from his long hours of sleep and yawned. She laughed and dropped to her knees to pet him, scratching his upper belly till she hit the sweet spot and his leg began to thump in doggy ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m jealous of my dog.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. Mr. Hotness lounged in the doorway with a jar in his hands. Worn Levi\u2019s rode low on his hips, and a simple white T-shirt stretched across his broad chest. His feet were bare.</p><p>Her body slammed to full alert, ready to play. She gazed at him with suspicion. \u201cRocky will always be number one. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>A wicked gleam danced in his eyes. Her heart sped up. \u201cYou worked through dinner. Thought I\u2019d bring you a treat to raise your blood sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow considerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? Wanna taste?\u201d</p><p>She glared at the jar, then back at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate.\u201d</p><p>The word slid from his mouth like hot fudge. Her stomach dipped. He shifted his hips and that hot gaze traveled from her head to the tip of her naked toes. Carina tried to clear her throat, but her saliva had dried up. The man should be illegal. She forced the words out. \u201cNot hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Her temper flared. \u201cI\u2019m not playing these games with you, Max. Why don\u2019t you trot along and do what you do best? Go save someone who needs it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want anyone else.\u201d</p><p>The words seared and burned like flame. She flung her head up and grit her teeth. \u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Now. Take off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>Carina froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d Like a predator, he closed in with a lazy grace and a careful eye. She clenched her fingers into fists and struggled for breath. He stopped in front of her. Pulses of energy shot at her, demanding she listen. Something inside her rose and cried out to obey. Holy crap, why did him ordering her around get her so hot? And why did she want to obey so badly? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me tell you everything I want, Carina. I\u2019ve been lying in my bed these past weeks with an erection that won\u2019t go away. Thinking of that night, over and over, and wondering how many different ways I can make you come.\u201d</p><p>Heat engulfed her. Her breasts swelled against the constraints of her bra and her nipples tightened to painful points. Holding her completely under his spell, he lowered his head and stopped inches from her lips. His scent swam around her and made her dizzy. He pressed a thumb to her lower lip and dragged it across. \u201cI know you\u2019re pissed. I know I fucked up. But I want you so bad I\u2019m going out of my head. Why not give ourselves this?\u201d</p><p>His words held a deep truth she so desperately wanted to believe. This she could trust. His penis pressed against her thigh, and her body wept for relief. Toe-curling, orgasmic, satisfying sex. No more. No less.</p><p>Just like that night.</p><p>Carina hesitated on the edge of the abyss. Could she play such a dangerous game, knowing she still felt so deeply for him?</p><p>He reached out and grabbed a clean paintbrush from the easel. With slow, deliberate motions, he ran the brush down her cheek. She shivered at the teasing touch, and her nerve endings sizzled like eggs on a hot skillet. \u201cSay yes. Because I want to play.\u201d</p><p>Her knees weakened in true clich\u00e9 form. She wondered if she\u2019d faint also, or kick up her leg when he finally kissed her. Arousal pounded through her bloodstream and hit her clit until there was no other answer to give.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved, unbuttoning the smock and tossing it on the floor. Her shirt came up over her head. He studied her black bra with a bad-boy stare and reached around her. She hissed out a breath as he unsnapped it with one deft motion and the skimpy lace fell to her feet. Big hands cupped her breasts, lifting, stroking, until a moan rose from her throat. Without pause, his fingers slipped down and pulled the snap of her shorts. Slid the zipper down. And tugged them off.</p><p>Trying not to pant, she stood in front of him in a tiny black thong. A hot blush stained her cheeks. He bent his head and kissed her. Deeply and thoroughly, with a lazy sweep of his tongue. The taste of coffee and mint intoxicated her, until she pressed against him and nipped at his mouth in punishment. When he pulled away, a savage glint lit his blue eyes. \u201cYou are so fucking beautiful. Let me look at you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>Half drunk from his burning stare, she slipped out of the panties.</p><p>Max gazed at her for a long time, hungrily touching every part of her body bared to him. Knowing he was fully dressed only added to the wetness between her legs and the feeling of being overtaken and commanded. With a satisfied smile, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long silk scarf.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAre we doing the Fifty Shades of Grey thing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Max laughed. \u201cDio, I adore you. We can discuss. For tonight, I just want to blindfold you for a taste test. Do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then reminded herself it was only her body, only sex. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The fabric was cool as he tied it over her eyes and gently knotted it. Blackness engulfed her. It took a moment for her to gain her bearings. She used her sense of smell and the feel of his body heat to locate his position. Her ears strained as she heard a cap twisted and a soft hiss, then the swish of clothes. His gravelly voice low in her ear.</p><p>\u201cRelax and enjoy. Tell me what you smell.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and the heavenly rich scent made her moan. \u201cChocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. Now a taste.\u201d He placed a tiny drop on her tongue. The bittersweet flavor exploded in her mouth in a sweet sugar rush.</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d Her tongue swept out and licked her bottom lip. \u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in his breath. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and waited, but nothing came. Instead, the gentle stroke of a brush against her nipple surprised her. She jerked back in reaction, but he continued the insistent, teasing motions, until her nipple felt covered in chocolate. Carina gasped at the sensation as the buds tightened in anticipation. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured. His tongue was hot and wet as he licked it off her, until she arched and hung on to his shoulders for balance. Darts of arousal pinged her body, and she grew wet and achy. \u201cYou\u2019re right, baby. The chocolate is delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p> <p>His low laugh raked across her nerve endings. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that.\u201d</p><p>And she did. He painted her other nipple and sucked it into his mouth, swirling his tongue around and around until she begged for mercy. The paintbrush became an instrument of torture and orgasmic ecstasy. He drew a line down the valley of her breasts and dipped into her belly button. Licked it off. Nibbled across her stomach and down her thighs. His breath blew hot across her core, but he firmly ignored her pleas and investigated the sensitive curve of her knee, her calf, and even her ankle.</p><p>Carina dissolved into a mass of writhing sensation. Her mind spun, trapped in darkness and guided to every peak and valley by the sound of his voice, or the touch of his hands. She panted as she closed in on a powerful orgasm, caught on the precipice and awaiting his next demand.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I can\u2019t take any more.\u201d</p><p>He shushed her and painted her lips with the chocolate. Then kissed her, deep and hungry, sharing the sweet taste between them. Her lids pricked with frustrated tears. Suddenly, he lifted her in the air and she was carried. The sound of brushes clattering and jars bouncing rose to her ears. He pressed her down on a hard surface, which she quickly calculated as the art table. \u201cWe\u2019re almost done. There\u2019s just one place I haven\u2019t tasted yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He parted her legs and the brush teased the tight bud between her legs. Dipped in her channel. She dug her nails into her palms and fought for sanity.</p><p>Then he put his mouth on her.</p><p>She cried out and came hard, her body wracked in spasm after spasm. Tears pricked her lids as she shattered and he held her down on the table, making her ride out each wave until it was over. Carina heard a rip, and a curse. Then he claimed her.</p><p>The silky thrust of his erection drove her back to the peak, and this time he joined her when she orgasmed the second time. Time stopped. Hours, minutes, seconds ticked by. The blindfold loosened and she blinked.</p><p>His face came into view. Heavy brows. Hard cheekbones. Granite-like jaw and sensual, full lips Michelangelo would\u2019ve wept over. He smiled. \u201cDid you like the chocolate?\u201d</p><p>She sputtered a laugh. \u201cYou really are a bastard, aren\u2019t you? Christian Grey has nothing on you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed with her. \u201cMy name might be similar, but I\u2019d never say \u2018Laters, baby.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cYou read it!\u201d</p><p>He looked offended. \u201cSaw it on Twitter. Now don\u2019t piss me off or I\u2019ll torture you with Cool Whip.\u201d</p><p>Carina wondered if something was wrong with her. The idea sounded a bit too interesting.</p><p>He helped her off the table and pushed her hair back with a gentle motion. The sudden arrangement she agreed to finally crystallized. No longer at the mercy of her body, Carina wondered if she\u2019d just made an agreement with the Devil. Her nakedness only added to the vulnerability. Did she really think it was possible to separate sex from her feelings for this man? Panic clawed at her gut. \u201cMax, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, baby.\u201d As if he realized her dilemma, he scooped her up in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to bed now. I\u2019ll show you some of my other skills learned from reading erotic romance novels.\u201d</p><p>Carina clung to him and decided not to delve any further.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cAre you and Carina having problems?\u201d</p><p>They met in the study. The large windows looked out over the formal gardens and the sound of buzzing bees and streaming water floated through the open screens. Michael handed him a glass of cognac and they settled into the oversized leather chairs. The room gave off an aura of calm and serenity, with ceiling-to-floor bookshelves, red art deco lamps, and the baby grand piano against the far wall. The smell of leather, paper, and orange wood polish filled the air.</p><p>After Carina broke the news to her brother about leaving, he\u2019d asked to see Max privately after work. Max agreed, knowing it was time to clear some things up. Too many lies had been told and he was getting sick of it. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the heir to the family business. I didn\u2019t give her a hard time because I figured she needed to get the art thing out of her system. Now she wants to work with Alexa at the bookstore and I\u2019m worried. I intend to pass La Dolce Maggie on to her as my second in command. It is her legacy.\u201d</p><p>His throat tightened. Blood was blood, and he didn\u2019t have it. No matter he worked his ass off and made the company a success. He may be welcomed as family, but would never be called family, even though he married Carina. If Michael didn\u2019t want him to take the helm, it was time he looked elsewhere. Built something of his own. But damned if he\u2019d let his friend mess with his wife.</p><p>His voice nipped as frosty as a chilled bottle of Moretti. \u201cGet over it, Michael. She doesn\u2019t want to work for the bakery, and she\u2019s not going to.\u201d</p><p>Michael waved his hand in the air, used to getting what he wanted. \u201cYou can help me convince her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Michael stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He uncurled himself from the chair and closed the distance. \u201cI said no. She\u2019s happy painting. And guess what? She\u2019s amazing. Carina has talent and passion and she\u2019s been told too many times it\u2019s just a hobby by all of us. She\u2019s finding out who she is and I love watching her. And if I\u2019m not good enough for you because I don\u2019t have your precious blood running through my veins, it\u2019s time I moved on.\u201d</p><p>Michael jerked as if hit. \u201cScusi? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive your precious bakery to Maggie, or to your children. I\u2019m done hoping I\u2019ll be enough.\u201d A crazy laugh escaped his lips. \u201cFunny, I think I finally see how Carina has felt all these years. Trying to measure up but just missing the mark. Leave her alone. Let her be who she wants, without us telling her what we want.\u201d</p><p>Michael placed his glass on the coaster and stared. \u201cI never knew you felt like this. Why haven\u2019t you said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be enough without relying on our friendship.\u201d</p><p>His friend threw out a tirade of colorful curses. \u201cAll this time I counted on you to be there and never questioned your role. Because you are family, Maximus. My brother, my friend, my right-hand man. You being involved in the business was never in question. I just never thought to put it in writing. Mi dispiace. I will correct this.\u201d</p><p>The simplicity of his acceptance stunned him. All this time, and it had nothing to do with not being good enough. Just the common male trait of barreling forward and forgetting to make his feelings known. The dream of everything he worked so hard for shimmered in front of him. All he needed to do was reach out and take it.</p><p>Time to put everything on the table.</p><p>\u201cI slept with your sister in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>The words rang out like a tire blowout in the middle of church. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael cocked his head. A sharp birdcall rang through the open window. \u201cWhat do you mean? You were married in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Max shoved his hands in his pockets and faced the man he loved like blood. \u201cBefore we were married. We had a one-night stand.\u201d</p><p>Michael unfurled himself from the leather chair and crossed the burgundy oriental carpet. His dark features remained smooth, but a cold fury gleamed from his eyes. \u201cYou slept with her before you were married? On a business trip I sent you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you loved her enough to get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your mother found us the next morning and convinced us to marry.\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed from his teeth. \u201cYou never even loved my sister? Treated her like one of your cheap lovers when I trusted you?\u201d Michael\u2019s voice dropped with warning. \u201cI want all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He jerked back. \u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d</p> <p>Max held his ground. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer your concern. What happens between Carina and me moving forward is our business. I owed you the truth, but I\u2019m not helping you change my wife\u2019s mind about the company. She needs to find her own path, and I\u2019m backing her all the way.\u201d</p><p>The betrayal in his friend\u2019s eyes cut deeper than any knife wound. \u201cHow dare you speak to me like this? I trusted you to protect my sister, and you used her. You married her without love and mocked our friendship.\u201d His hand shook as Michael stabbed a finger through the air. \u201cYou broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>The scene from The Godfather flashed before his eyes, and suddenly Max knew what Fredo felt like. Merda, what a mess. He looked his friend dead in the eye and took the heat. He had no choice. He realized his core need to protect Carina from harm and finally stand up for her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Michael. I never meant to hurt you. But this is our business, not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was ready to give you a permanent part of the company! Make you partner. This is how you show your loyalty and respect for my family?\u201d</p><p>Max shoved down his temper and tried to remain calm. \u201cIt\u2019s my family, too. Carina is now my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know if we can work together any longer, Maximus. Not like this. And not without trust.\u201d</p> <p>The dream of partnership exploded like fireworks, and broken pieces flew around him like charred paper. Maybe if he explained more of the situation Michael would finally understand. They could talk together about options and\u2014</p><p>No.</p><p>Just last night he\u2019d thrust between those silky thighs and held her through the night. She\u2019d pushed him toward anger, passion, laughter, and comforted him when he spoke about his father. She made him feel alive and whole. He loved eating long dinners, talking about work, and watching her with his dog. Damned if he\u2019d betray what fragile trust they had by selling her out for a contract. Her brother no longer owned rights to her life.</p><p>Or his.</p><p>Max let out a humorless laugh. The realization he didn\u2019t care about the partnership anymore rattled his composure. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScusi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can no longer work with me, I understand. Carina means more.\u201d</p><p>Michael narrowed his gaze. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me the partnership. Fire me. Doesn\u2019t matter. But make sure you stay out of Carina\u2019s life and let her make her own decisions\u2014including what happens with our marriage.\u201d</p><p>He left the room and his harsh words without a backward glance. The hell with it. He was tired of lying and making excuses for his crappy behavior.</p><p>He\u2019d done enough of that to last his whole life.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>She\u2019d slept with Max.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Carina drove home from her shift at BookCrazy, tapping her fingers absently on the steering wheel while she tried to make sense of the situation. She resented his false, half-assed proposal under pressure from her mother. But the arousal in his eyes caused her brain to ooze from her head until there was nothing left but surrender. His body never lied. Why shouldn\u2019t she enjoy that aspect of their relationship? They were married, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>The inner whisper screamed the truth.</p><p>Because she was still in love with him.</p><p>Always had been. Always would be. Like a cross heavy on her back, she never got over her feelings for Max. Bringing in sex complicated things. She\u2019d be less able to keep her barriers up and be the strong, controlled woman she so desperately needed to be.</p><p>Curiously, in all other aspects of her life she felt . . . different. Stronger. Leaving La Dolce Maggie had been difficult. She bet Michael still believed he could encourage her to return, and Julietta placed an urgent call trying to change her mind. The conversations only confirmed she\u2019d made the right decision. Her painting grew by leaps and bounds, and her class finally confirmed she needed to break through her barriers and paint what her soul screamed for. The erotic photos on Sawyer\u2019s wall had called out to her, and the images being coaxed from her brush made her squirm with both embarrassment and pride. Who would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d been a woman to burn for a dominant lover, and an artist who loved erotica?</p><p>Even her job at the bookstore soothed something within her. She finally found a perfect blend of business and creativity by working around books, and enjoyed using her accounting skills to help Alexa.</p><p>If only her marriage hadn\u2019t started under false pretenses, everything would\u2019ve been perfect.</p><p>Was she crazy to stay? Why didn\u2019t she just pack her bags and move out? The slow torture of being around him and not getting what she needed was brutal. The hell with it. She was leaving. Moving on. She\u2019d play lots of angry-woman music and go a bit nutty and clear her past with one huge leap into the beyond.</p><p>Liar.</p><p>The inner voice cackled with merriment. She wasn\u2019t ready yet. A tiny glimmer of hope kept her rooted to the house and his life. Wasn\u2019t that what she heard kept torture victims alive for years? The hope of escape and rescue. Yeah, her own beaten soul wasn\u2019t ready to give up the dream of the man she loved. The thought of never seeing his beloved face again made the action impossible.</p><p>At least, for now.</p><p>Carina sighed and pulled up to the house. She parked the car in the circular drive and made her way down the paved walkway. Lush rosebushes and spiky pine trees created a mystical landscape around Max\u2019s mansion. Mini water fountains lined the path toward the gardens, and the sound of water trickling soothed her nerves. She loved to drag her canvas out by the pool and paint. Mentally juggling her schedule, she calculated she may have time for an hour of sketching before going to the store for her second shift.</p><p>She yanked her keys from her purse.</p><p>The dove dropped in front of her.</p><p>Carina jerked back in horror as the snowy white bird fell from the sky and crashed on the sidewalk. His leg twisted and he lifted his tiny head, then slid back to the pavement and remained still.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d Dropping her stuff, she knelt on the ground. Definitely breathing. Still alive. The tag on his foot held a number and with trembling fingers, she began to carefully examine him. The wing lay at a crooked angle, broken. Legs and feet seemed solid. She couldn\u2019t seem to find any blood on the ground, but its eyes were closed.</p><p>She gently picked the bird up, cradled him in her arms, and brought him inside. Immediately, she found an old soft towel and placed him in the middle. Blinking back tears, she called the vet, then did a quick search on the Internet for confirmation and instructions.</p><p>Carina grabbed the phone and dialed.</p><p>\u201cMax, I need you to come home. I need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>She clicked the button and waited.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Carina gazed at the bird now placed in a large fish tank, his wing securely wrapped in tape. His eyes were open but a bit glazed, as if still not sure what had happened. Max examined the number on the tag and wrote it down on a piece of paper. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing everything possible. The vet said there seem to be no internal injuries, so the wing should heal and we can send him back. I\u2019m going to do a search for the number and see if I can contact the owner.\u201d</p><p>She wrung her hands and watched the dove breathe. Max pulled her in his arms and she leaned into his chest, breathing in his familiar scent. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. You\u2019re not called the animal whisperer for nothing. If he has a shot, it\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the familiar title her family crowned her with for her talent and connection with animals. For one moment, she relaxed into his heat and protection. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you leave work.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to the top of her head.\u201dI\u2019m glad you called me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Comfort twisted into heat. His erection pressed against her thigh. Carina stiffened and the air grew thick with sexual tension. God, she wanted him. Wanted to strip off his sexy red tie and pin-striped suit, climb on his lap, and ride him until she forgot. Forgot he never wanted to marry her and didn\u2019t love her the way she needed him to. The memory of him sucking chocolate off her nipples and between her thighs burned behind her lids. The way he held her with tenderness throughout the night, as if he sensed she needed something more. She sucked in a breath and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists and looked away. His muscles stiffened and she waited him out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can wait until you\u2019re ready. I just\u2014miss you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stuttered. Damn him. She shook with temper. \u201cBullshit. You miss being in charge of this whole relationship. You miss me panting after you like a dog in heat, with you calling all the shots. Don\u2019t patronize me and pretend it was more than that.\u201d</p><p>His brows slammed together. \u201cI refuse to let you talk about yourself like that,\u201d he stated coldly. \u201cYou have every right to be pissed off, but don\u2019t demean both of us. Things have changed.\u201d</p><p>Carina shook her head in disbelief. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed. The only thing different between us is the sex. The rest is just a big fat lie.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. A shadow fell over his face. \u201cWe\u2019re married now. Can\u2019t we move forward? It\u2019s not as if we\u2019re strangers and have nothing between us.\u201d</p><p>The last fragile thread of her temper broke. \u201cWhere the fuck is my happily-ever-after, Max? I dreamed of a real proposal, with a man on bent knee and vows he actually meant. You know what I got? Good intentions, responsibility, and a few orgasms.\u201d She practically spit out her next words. \u201cYou want sex that bad? What is my mother blackmailing you with now? Or do you just want to have sex with me to get me knocked up and secure you an heir?\u201d</p><p>Furious blue eyes met and shredded her with a ruthlessness that made her shudder. \u201cI\u2019ll forgive you for that comment. Once. I\u2019ll also leave you alone, but be warned. When I think you\u2019ve had enough time, I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d He smiled cruelly. \u201cAnd I promise you\u2019ll beg for more.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed behind him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He was such a dick.</p><p>Max glanced up the staircase and listened to the strains of Rihanna vibrating in the air. Two days had passed since their fight. She\u2019d kept her distance and treated him with an icy politeness that drove him nuts. She worked long shifts at BookCrazy, holed up in the art room, and avoided dinner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A loneliness he\u2019d never noticed before permeated the air of his home. Her energy pulsed through the rooms but he craved direct contact, a real conversation. He missed her laughter and enthusiasm and wit. He missed everything about her. Rocky got more time with her than he did.</p><p>He never should have pushed. When she\u2019d come so naturally into his arms, her scent wrapped around him and he\u2019d been drugged. The softness of her curves pressed against his chest. The silky brush of her curls. He had ached to pull her into the bedroom and claim her all over again. Now, he realized it was the epitome of bad timing.</p><p>Max groaned. So stupid. Instead of being rational and giving her the time she needed, he had threatened her. Yeah, the blood had definitely gone to his other head, and he had no excuse. Her heartfelt statement about her own happily-ever-after seared into his brain and broke his heart. Was that what he\u2019d done to her? Ripped away her illusions and dreams?</p><p>He always worried he\u2019d break her heart one day. Sure, he was forced into marrying her, but why didn\u2019t it feel like such a chore? Why did he look forward to coming home and catching a glimpse? She deserved so much more. Instead, she got him.</p> <p>Depression settled over him. The hell with it. He\u2019d cook dinner and force her to interact. Max headed toward the bedroom, stripped off his suit, and changed into jeans and a black T-shirt. He poured two glasses of Merlot and settled on a chicken salsa dish she\u2019d like. The meditative motions of preparing a meal soothed him. The culinary kitchen had been custom-built, with cream granite countertops, a Sub-Zero fridge, a brick oven for pizza, and a Viking stove. The island cut through the main area with a sink and separate work area, a breakfast bar, and cushioned leather stools. He grabbed a few copper pots, drizzled in the olive oil, and began chopping tomatoes and onions. Ten minutes later, she clattered down the stairs and stood framed in the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m going. Don\u2019t wait up.\u201d</p><p>He threw down the knife and leaned one hip against the counter. \u201cI\u2019m cooking dinner. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBookstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay for a bite. You need food before your long shift.\u201d</p><p>She shifted on her feet, obviously tempted. \u201cCan\u2019t. I\u2019ll grab something at the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey only have snacks, you need protein. For God\u2019s sake, I promise you don\u2019t have to stay long in my company. Sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a chair and sat. Her immediate response reminded him of her obedience in the bedroom and gave him an instant hard-on. He slid the chicken onto a plate, topped it with salsa, and plopped it on the counter with a fork. She dove in with her usual relish, making those yummy sounds of pleasure. He shifted with discomfort and tried to adjust. \u201cDid you find anything out about our dove?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I tracked the tag to an owner about fifty miles from here. She\u2019s a homing pigeon, known as a rock dove. Name\u2019s Gabby. She\u2019s not a regular racer, but he sends her out on occasional missions to keep her sharp. A few of his friends belong to a club, and I guess all their doves returned except Gabby. He\u2019s been frantic.\u201d</p><p>Max filled his own plate and slid into the stool across from her. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize racing pigeons even existed. Is he coming to pick her up?\u201d</p> <p>She took a sip of her wine. \u201cNo, I explained what we did and the damage to Gabby\u2019s wing, and he agreed to let me take care of her here until she\u2019s healed. Then I can let her fly home. If there are any problems with her recovery, he\u2019ll drive over to pick her up, but I think she\u2019s doing better already. She\u2019s alert and seems to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long before she can be released?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo to three weeks, depending.\u201d A smile broke over her face. \u201cThe owner said she was used to carry letters back and forth between separated couples. Isn\u2019t that cool?\u201d</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cExtremely. Just be careful, sweetheart. You always get attached.\u201d</p><p>Her nose scrunched up. \u201cI know. She\u2019s only a bird, so I should be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. What about the chipmunk?\u201d</p><p>A laugh escaped her lips. \u201cI forgot about that! But I was young.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and forked another piece of chicken. \u201cYou named him Dale from the Disney cartoons. I think he faked that hurt leg. You set him up in the shed with his own man cave. No wonder the rodent didn\u2019t want to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him a rodent. He was sweet. He didn\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was damn mean. Bit me and Michael all the time when we tried to play with him. Then he brought all his rodent friends to party and we were afraid to even go in and get our bikes.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes glowed and the lines in her beautiful face softened. \u201cPapa got so mad. They chewed holes in the wall and stored towers of nuts. He forced me to get rid of Dale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cried for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have trouble letting go of those I love.\u201d</p><p>The startling confession burst through the room. She jerked back, obviously regretting her words, and concentrated on her plate. Max spoke softly. \u201cI know. They always seem to come back to you, though. \u201c</p><p>Carina refused to look up. He fought the urge to caress her cheek and kiss the sadness away. Instead, he poured more wine and changed the subject. \u201cHow\u2019s your work coming? Are you still doing portraits?\u201d</p><p>A strange expression flickered over her face. \u201cKind of. I\u2019m trying something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of contacts in the art world, Carina. I\u2019d love to set you up with a consultant. If they like it, maybe a show can be arranged?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in between bites. \u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m handling this on my own.\u201d</p><p>He bit back his frustration and reminded himself she needed to prove her own success. He already believed in her. She just needed to believe in herself. \u201cFine, I respect that. You don\u2019t have to work such long hours at BookCrazy, you know. Alexa told Michael you were amazing, but you take double shifts all the time. I never see you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the money.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head. \u201cYou\u2019re from one of the richest families in Italy. I don\u2019t do too poorly myself, and you\u2019re my wife. Why the hell would you need to work for money?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin in that stubborn tilt that drove him crazy. \u201cMichael\u2019s rich. You\u2019re rich. I\u2019m not rich. I may have a fat trust fund, but I\u2019m going to make my own way, just like everyone else. If that means working extra shifts, I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>He bit back a curse. \u201cFamily takes care of their own. What\u2019s theirs is yours. Why can\u2019t you understand that?\u201d</p><p>She gave an unladylike snort. \u201cSame way you can\u2019t understand how it feels to have failed at everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. \u201cFailed? You succeed at everything you touch.\u201d</p><p>Her voice turned to ice. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Max. You may want to get me back in bed, but lying doesn\u2019t cut it. I sucked at being a chef like Mama. I wasn\u2019t good at business like Julietta and Michael. And I sucked at anything to do with personal fashion, beauty, or looks like Venezia. Don\u2019t insult me.\u201d</p><p>His heart broke. This beautiful, spirited, giving woman believed she wasn\u2019t worthy. The urge to strangle her or kiss her warred inside him. Instead, he swallowed past the tightness in his throat and told the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou succeeded at everything precious in this world, Carina. People. Animals. Love. Nothing else matters, you know. But you just don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. Those soulful dark eyes grew wide with astonishment. A connection blazed between them, hot and bright, and the air grew clogged with emotion. He put down his fork to reach for her.</p><p>Carina jumped off the seat and took a few steps back. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. Thanks for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She flew out of the kitchen and left him alone and empty.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A few days later, Carina studied the paintings in front of her with a critical eye. The class had helped with form and taught her a few techniques that took her to the next level. Her teacher even commented on getting in contact with someone for representation, especially if she completed a cohesive series. A tiny trickle of alarm slid down her spine. A public showing would mean more than coming out of the closet as a hopeful artist. It would mean stripping naked and screaming \u201cLook at me!\u201d in the middle of Times Square.</p><p>The real problem, of course, was her family. Her supportive, well-meaning core group who believed she had talent but painted as a hobby. Not once had she expressed her soul screaming for the opportunity to be a professional artist. Art was well respected in Bergamo, but business was revered, especially with the famous La Dolce Famiglia bakeries in the Conte name.</p><p>Carina nibbled at her bottom lip and scrawled her name at the bottom.</p><p>Her first official piece completed. And if anyone saw it, they\u2019d believe she was a slut.</p><p>The lines were blurred in a hazy gray black that cast the couple in shadow. The woman\u2019s hard nipple revealed her arousal, and her face caught the onlooker\u2019s eye with a naked ecstasy as if she was fighting orgasm. The man\u2019s back was turned and blocked the rest of her bare body. Lean muscles bunched and a tattoo claimed the top left shoulder in that of a serpent. The window sketched toward the right-hand side of the painting gave the impression of a sense of voyeurism peeking into their sensual world, while the bright light of day and sanity remained through the glass.</p><p>She fisted her hands, then slowly worked out her fingers. The cramp in her wrist told her she\u2019d been at it for hours. Excitement nibbled on her nerve endings. It was good. She felt it deep inside her gut, a sense of satisfaction she rarely experienced anymore. Not since she started college. She\u2019d fought the pull of her instinct for a while now, but only created flat, two-dimensional portraits that left her cold.</p><p>The raw erotic nature shocked her. Who would\u2019ve known Max ripped open the gates of her soul and tore off the locks? No going back to sensible, clean creations. The moment she lay eyes on the portraits in Sawyer\u2019s office, she knew she needed to dig deep and paint nudity. No matter what happened with her work, at least she was telling the truth. About her nature. Her wants. Needs. Fantasies.</p><p>About time.</p><p>She cleaned her brushes, tucked away her acrylics, and stripped off her smock. Time to give Rocky a treat and check on Gabby. She\u2019d invited her family for dinner, and hoped she\u2019d have time for a quick nap in the sun first.</p><p>Gabby greeted her with the normal coo she\u2019d begun to love. Already, she dreaded the time she needed to let Gabby fly away. The bird\u2019s bright, knowing eyes told a deeper story with an exotic past Carina would love to know more about. Maybe she\u2019d have a chat with her owner before releasing her.</p><p>She checked the dressing and bandage, fed her, and carried the converted fish tank outside to the back patio. The Olympic-sized pool was surrounded by lush foliage, imported palm trees, and vivid red and purple irises to surround swimmers in a tropical lagoon. Rocky padded outside, not giving Gabby a second thought, and plopped beside her on a lounge chair. Carina slid into the Adirondack chair with her pets flanking her, a glass of Merlot on the table, and the sound of gushing water and wind in the background. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sense of peace settled over her. She murmured occasional comments to Gabby and Rocky, and slowly, her lids closed.</p><p>\u201cCarina?\u201d</p><p>Her name slid from his mouth like honey and caramel, all smooth and gooey and delicious. She smiled and lifted her face upward, too relaxed to lift her arms. The delicious smell of man, soap, and a hint of spicy cologne drifted on the breeze. \u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>Gentle fingers caressed her cheek. She pressed against that warm hand and kissed his palm. A low mutter. \u201cAh, sweetheart, there\u2019s a storm coming. You should come in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c \u2019Kay.\u201d She stretched, wanting him to strip off her clothes, part her thighs, and slide home. Her muscles clenched in delicious anticipation. She nibbled on his strong wrist and sighed. \u201cTaste good. Smell good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDio, you are killing me.\u201d</p><p>The fuzzy haze of sleep blurred her good intentions and her brain waves. She blinked and reached up. Pushed back the crisp strands of hair across his brow. Traced the arrogant hook of his nose, his soft, full lips. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d she murmured. \u201cToo beautiful for me, though. Aren\u2019t you, Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck this. I\u2019m no saint.\u201d</p><p>His lips coasted over hers. Warm, capable, sipping from her mouth like savoring an expensive glass of wine. His taste exploded on her tongue and she moaned, opening to him fully. He kissed her for long, slow moments that went on and on, until she melted into the chair and the flesh between her legs grew swollen and wet. When he finally lifted his head, she knew he\u2019d won. Waited for him to pick her up and bring her into his bedroom. And at that moment, she didn\u2019t care anymore.</p> <p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>The ding caused Rocky to launch off his rest spot and bark. She bumped back into reality like a rough landing and pushed herself up. Max shook his head. \u201cI may kill whoever\u2019s at that door,\u201d he said. With one last hard look, he disappeared through the French doors.</p><p>Carina slid out of the chair. She wondered if Fate stepped in to save her. How long could she hold out before falling back into his bed? The voice of her sister-in-law floated through the screen and she took a deep breath to steady her nerves. She was safe from temptation now.</p><p>For a while.</p><p>Maggie waddled in looking generally huge, uncomfortable, and majorly pissed off. The black stretch knit dress hit her knees, and rhinestone flip-flops slapped over the marble floors. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get out of me now, Carina, I\u2019m gonna take them out myself.\u201d She marched into the living room, stood at the edge of the comfy chair, and fell back. Carina had a feeling she wouldn\u2019t be getting up unless they had a crane.</p><p>She clucked with sympathy and a bit of humor. \u201cProbably next week, Maggie. They\u2019re close.\u201d</p> <p>Maggie glared and took the glass of seltzer with lemon from Max. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not. I just went to the doctor yesterday, who told me there wasn\u2019t a contraction in sight. Nada. Niente. They\u2019re nice and cozy in there. They get food, sleep, and play karate when they\u2019re bored. Why would they come out?\u201d She moaned. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get a C-section unless necessary but I think it\u2019s the only way. They need to feel threatened or they\u2019ll never come out.\u201d</p><p>Carina patted her sister-in-law\u2019s hand. \u201cI bet within five days you\u2019ll be holding two perfectly healthy, happy babies. Remember the same thing happened with Alexa? She was two weeks late with her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was a riot. Nick almost drove to the hospital without her.\u201d</p><p>Max brought Mama Conte some tea and they sat in front of the crackling fire. \u201cYeah, I heard that story, a pure classic. How is Alexa doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine. They took Lily to Sesame Place for the weekend. You know how she obsesses over Elmo.\u201d Lightning lit the sky, and a rumble of thunder sounded low and threatening. \u201cSupposed to be a wicked storm today. Hope Michael doesn\u2019t get caught in it. He\u2019s running late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he was going to take the car into Manhattan for his meeting, but decided on the train. There\u2019s some big protest going on by Wall Street today and he didn\u2019t want to get stuck in traffic. He should be okay.\u201d</p><p>Maggie rubbed her massive belly. \u201cNot sure if I can even eat tonight. Awful indigestion all day.\u201d The ringing tune of \u201cSexy Back\u201d boomed through the room, and Maggie reached over for her purse. \u201cThat\u2019s Michael. I can\u2019t reach it.\u201d</p><p>Carina grabbed the hot pink cell phone and handed it to her. Maggie\u2019s side of the conversation included curse words and sympathetic murmurings. Finally she clicked off. \u201cYou are not going to be believe this. There\u2019s a major blackout in the city and all the trains are delayed. He\u2019s stuck there for a few more hours.\u201d</p> <p>Carina nibbled on her lip. \u201cWill he be okay? Are there police? Where is he right now?\u201d</p><p>Maggie sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s eating at La Mia Casa. It\u2019s a little Italian restaurant I used to haunt, and now I got him addicted. I know Gavin, the owner. He\u2019ll take good care of Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Well, you can sleep over here if you want. We\u2019ll treat you to a homemade breakfast in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte snorted. \u201cI will make breakfast, Carina. I miss not cooking for my family, and my skills are getting rusty. Tonight we will have a slumber party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we watch Magic Mike?\u201d Maggie asked.</p><p>Max lifted a brow. \u201cSomehow I don\u2019t think Mama Conte will like that choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the older woman demanded. \u201cWhat is it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale strippers,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked thoughtful. \u201cI will try it.\u201d</p><p>Max groaned. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Michael.\u201d</p><p>The hours flew by with good conversation, laughter, and food. Michael called once more to check in and confirm he was okay, but probably wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of the city until early morning. Maggie rested her feet on a pillow and snuggled under a comforter. Max finally caved and allowed them to slip in the movie, but promptly regretted it when all three women panted over the first scene. He threw popcorn at the television screen to distract them.</p><p>Maggie sighed with satisfaction as the ending credits rolled. \u201cI love that movie,\u201d she declared. \u201cIt\u2019s so deep.\u201d</p><p>Max snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s female porn. I feel dirty just watching it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just mad because the hot chick never took her clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have more respect for women than you do men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right, I think\u2014Oh, my God.\u201d</p><p>Carina looked at Maggie. Pure horror contorted her features. She breathed deep and glanced down in shock. \u201cI think my water broke.\u201d</p><p>The dampness of the sofa confirmed it. She rubbed her stomach. \u201cI thought it was indigestion, but now I\u2019m thinking I was in labor today.\u201d She looked across the room in a panic.</p><p>Carina froze. Max held his breath. Mama Conte rose from the sofa with a serene smile. Her dark eyes glowed. \u201cYou are going to have your babies, Margherita,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Tears swam in Maggie\u2019s green eyes and she shook her head hard. \u201cMichael\u2019s not here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI need him.\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte took both her hands and squeezed. \u201cI know. Your labor will go for many hours with twins. He will be here. If I know my son, he will do what he needs so he is beside you when your babies come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Her mama laughed. \u201cBut of course, you are scared! This is one of the scariest things you will ever do in your life. We are all here with you, Margherita. You have a family now, and we are not leaving.\u201d</p><p>Maggie took a deep breath. Nodded. Then reached for her phone. \u201cOkay. Let me call Michael, and the doctor. Max, can you get the car ready? Carina, can you go upstairs and find some things for me to bring? Toothbrush, robe, T-shirts, that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Carina rose from the couch and tugged Max with her. Her husband wore the comical expression of a man terrified to move, as if one word would elicit contractions and screaming from Maggie. \u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to do better than Nick, okay? Get the car and call Alex and Nick for us. Let them know what\u2019s happening. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave without us.\u201d His panicked eyes made something inside soften. She grabbed his hands and interweaved her fingers within his. Max blinked in surprise, and she smiled. \u201cWe get to see our nieces or nephews born today. Let\u2019s not forget a moment, okay?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head and kissed her. Just the softest touch, a whisper of lips sliding over hers and reminding her she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Thanks for reminding me.\u201d</p><p>He released her and disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cI want drugs!\u201d</p><p>Maggie never wailed, or screamed, or whined. She demanded in her pissed-off, snarky manner until every nurse in the place was afraid to go into her room. Max held her Rubik\u2019s Cube as her focal point and Carina gave the man credit. As each contraction rippled across the screen, he urged her to breathe through the pain and concentrate on her focal point. He took her curses and insults in stride and never wavered.</p><p>When he left to get her a glass of ice, she found the Rubik\u2019s Cube on the side of the bed and hurled it across the room.</p><p>The only person her sister-in-law seemed to listen to was Mama Conte. Her mother never coddled Maggie, and did not let her get away with bad behavior. But she never left her side, and spoke with her in a low soothing voice, telling her about the birth of each of her children and their special story. In the spaces between contractions, Maggie calmed and listened. Until the next wave hit.</p><p>Carina dragged Max out of the room for a moment. \u201cIs Michael going to make it?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s been hours and the last time they checked she was almost dilated enough to push.\u201d</p><p>Max tunneled his fingers through his hair and shifted from foot to foot. \u201cHe texted me he should be here within the hour. This is a nightmare. Michael and Alexa gone on the same damn day. I suck at this, Carina. She wants to kill me bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s in pain and scared and her husband\u2019s not here. But you\u2019re the next best thing, Max. You\u2019ve been friends since childhood.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cWhat happened to the days when men got to wait in the waiting room? Crap, I don\u2019t have to look down there when she pushes, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, buddy, you\u2019re not spitting two humans from your vagina. Suck it up. She needs you.\u201d</p><p>Her words penetrated his brain. He straightened up and nodded. \u201cSorry. I got this.\u201d</p><p>Maggie snarled between the rapidly increasing waves rocking the monitor. \u201cI signed up for a fucking epidural and I want it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage, Margherita,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou are past that point and it\u2019s almost time to push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without Michael.\u201d She gritted her teeth and panted. \u201cI\u2019m not pushing till Michael gets here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mama wiped the sweat off her forehead. \u201cHe will be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never having sex again. I hate sex!\u201d</p><p>Carina bit her lip and turned away. Her mother nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s voice cut through the room in sharp demand. \u201cMaggie, look at me. Concentrate on my face when the contractions come. I\u2019m going to tell you a story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is more like an action adventure. I\u2019m going to tell you about the first time Michael and I bonded.\u201d</p><p>Maggie looked a bit interested. He settled himself in the chair near the bed and leaned over. The monitor beeped and Max talked. \u201cOur mothers were always close friends so we basically grew up together. One day they took us to the playground and there was this massive climbing thing. I think we were six at the time? Anyway, we both got into a bragging match of who could get to the top first. Michael was a bit smaller than me, but he was quicker, so it was sort of an even match. We both scrambled to the top, trying to kick the other one off in a crazy game of Lord of the Flies, and then we got there at the same exact time.\u201d Max shook his head at the memory. \u201cI remember that moment when we looked at each other. As if we both realized we\u2019d be best friends and do everything together. Then we tried to shove the other one off.\u201d</p><p>Maggie fought for breath. \u201cAre you kidding me? Were you both psychos? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael and I both took a fall and broke our arms. The same damn one.\u201d</p> <p>Mama Conte snorted in disgust. \u201cI was speaking with Max\u2019s mama for only a minute, then we hear these screams. Both boys in a tangle in the dirt, blood everywhere. I think I almost passed out. We ran over to them and they were crying but laughing at the same time, as if they had both won something important.\u201d</p><p>Max grinned. \u201cWe had matching casts and called ourselves \u2018bone brothers.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Carina rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, I get it. Instead of blood brothers, you were bone brothers. Personally, I think you both were always a couple of boneheads.\u201d</p><p>Tears slid down Maggie\u2019s cheeks. Carina\u2019s heart broke for her sister-in-law, and she ached to make things right. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to make it, is he?\u201d</p><p>Max leaned over the bed and gazed at Maggie. Fierce blue eyes commanded her to dig deep. \u201cRight now it doesn\u2019t matter, Maggie. I\u2019m here for you. Lean on me, and think that Michael is my twin brother. Use me, and let\u2019s get these babies born. I will not leave your side.\u201d</p><p>The nurse walked in and examined her. \u201cLet\u2019s see, honey, are we ready to push?\u201d</p> <p>Maggie sniffed. Slowly, she reached out and took Max\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t let go, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I\u2019m ready now.\u201d</p><p>Carina and her mother stood on one side, and Max on the other. Time melted away until seconds blurred into minutes and back again. She pushed and grunted and cursed. Each one moved the twins a little bit farther, until Maggie lay back on the pillows, exhausted. Face red from exertion, perspiration rolling down her forehead, she gasped for air. \u201cI can\u2019t. No more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, mi amore. More.\u201d</p><p>Carina mashed her fingers against her lips as her brother strolled into the room. Commanding and confident, he took Max\u2019s place and held his wife\u2019s hands. Pressing kisses to her cheeks and forehead, he murmured something in her ear, and she nodded. Crunched up again. And pushed.</p><p>\u201cThe head\u2019s coming. Baby number one. One more, Maggie, make it a big one. Bear down and push!\u201d A wail lit the air and Carina watched the wrinkly newborn slide into the world. Slippery and red, the baby twisted in crankiness and let out another roar. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d She lay the baby on Maggie\u2019s stomach and voices swirled around them. Maggie sobbed and touched her son.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful. Oh, my God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not done, love,\u201d the nurse chirped. \u201cHere comes number two. One more push, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>With a roar, Maggie gritted her teeth.</p><p>Baby two popped out. \u201cAnother boy! Congratulations, Mama and Papa. You have two beautiful sons.\u201d</p><p>Carina watched in awe as her brother touched the babies in wonder, eyes wet from tears. Her mother laughed with delight. The room exploded with activity as the babies were weighed, measured, and wrapped in blankets with matching knit caps. As they worked on patching Maggie up, Michael cooed to his sons and lifted them up.</p><p>\u201cMeet Luke and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>Her mother reached out and held Luke, rocking him and murmuring in Italian. Carina pressed a kiss to her sister-in-law\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou did so good, Maggie,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Alexa couldn\u2019t be here with you. I know you missed her.\u201d</p><p>Maggie smiled up at her. \u201cNo, Carina, I\u2019m glad it was you. You were meant to be here with me tonight. I loved you the moment we met, and watched you blossom into a beautiful woman. You are truly my sister, and I\u2019d like for you be Luke\u2019s godmother.\u201d</p><p>Joy exploded inside of her until there was nothing left but pure emotion. She nodded, too choked up to talk. Her mother walked over and slid the blanket-covered bundle into her outstretched arms. \u201cMeet your godson Luke.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at the crinkly, wrinkled skin. The perfect mouth scrunched up in a tiny O. Dark hair peeked from beneath the pink and blue stretchy cap. Her fingers shook as she cooed and stroked his silky skin. He was a living, breathing miracle, proof of what can bloom from two people who love each other.</p><p>She blinked back a sheen of tears and looked up.</p><p>Max stared back. His blue eyes darkened with a raw need that reached across the space and ripped at her heart. She sucked in her breath.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He was in love with her.</p><p>Max watched his wife. She cooed to the baby and shifted on her heels as she rocked him back and forth in the ancient rhythm women seemed to possess. A strange emotion clawed up from his gut and tore out of him, leaving a bloody battered mess behind. His head throbbed and his mouth dried up like after a night of hard drinking. And the truth finally came in earth-shattering form to rival any end-of-the-world scenario from Revelations.</p><p>He loved her.</p><p>Had always loved her. That was why no woman seemed to fit throughout his life. Oh, it had been so easy to blame it on other factors. His career. His urge for freedom and adventure. His age. Excuses loaded up and so did the endless parade of women, all the same. Except for Carina\u2014his one constant. His friend. His lover. His soul mate.</p><p>Watching Maggie give birth cut at all the jagged pieces of his core. Challenged him on his bullshit and his false sense of honor, pride, and so-called respectability. Suddenly, it had nothing to do with being like his father. It had to do with having the guts to fight for the woman he loved on her terms. For giving her everything so she could finally choose.</p><p>He\u2019d never given Carina a chance. All the years he made the rules to keep himself distant and safe. Even their marriage was based on a false proposal that mocked all the real feelings he had for the only woman to complete him.</p><p>Head spinning, he walked slowly over and stopped beside her. Gazing down at the baby, he tipped her chin up so she met his stare head-on. \u201cCome home with me now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to do this for me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Carina dragged in a shaky breath and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She handed Luke to Mama Conte. Michael walked over and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThank you, my friend. You were right. I will not interfere again. You are not only my business partner, but my brother, and have always been there for me. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>He hugged his friend and clapped him on the back. \u201cNo forgiveness is needed with family. Congratulations, Papa. We\u2019ll be back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSi.\u201d</p><p>He led Carina out of the hospital and they kept silent on the drive to the house. He kept glancing at her profile but she remained distant, staring out the window, deep in thought.</p><p>When he discovered her by the pool earlier that day, asleep with her animals by her side, he\u2019d almost sunk to his knees. Her gorgeous face relaxed in the sun, moist lips parted, her lush beauty knocked him like a sucker punch. She responded to his voice and touch immediately, her subconscious already knowing she belonged to him. If Maggie hadn\u2019t interrupted, he\u2019d already be sunk into her hot, tight channel and convincing her that\u2019s where she belonged. Under him. Inside him. With him. All the time.</p><p>Somehow, he needed to convince her of the truth. He needed to bind her body once more to his, then beg her not to leave. Beg her to forgive him.</p><p>It was his final play to make this marriage real.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>She needed to end her marriage.</p><p>Carina stared out the window. The reality of the situation crashed around the moment Luke and Ethan slid into the world. She was living a lie. She wanted it all with Max\u2014but she\u2019d never have it. Because the bottom line was simple. Max could never love her the way she needed, and it was time to let him truly go.</p><p>She sensed he wanted to confess his own decision. Maybe they would finally agree, part friends, and deal with the consequences the best way possible.</p><p>He pulled up to their house way too fast and escorted her up the path and inside. One sharp order and Rocky stopped barking. He whined and sat down on the floor, giving her that sad puppy look that said he knew she was in trouble but didn\u2019t know how to help.</p><p>Heart pounding, she took a deep breath. \u201cMax, I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d</p><p>Her belly fisted and dipped low. God, he was sexy. He looked almost primitive with his nostrils flaring and those hot blue eyes beaming heat. Her nipples pressed against her shirt and she grew achy with need. She cursed the huskiness to her words and tried to clear her throat. \u201cNo. We need to talk, Max. I can\u2019t do this anymore with you, or to myself. This isn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m about to fix it now. Upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps pebbled her arms. He gripped her arm and led her toward the staircase. Her feet obeyed, until they ended up in the bedroom. The bed dominated the room with an almost obnoxious air. Ignoring her thumping heart, she faced him with hands crossed in front of her chest. \u201cHappy now? Ready to tell me your master plan now? How you\u2019re going to fix this mess of a marriage and our screwed-up relationship in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>He ripped off his shirt. Carina swallowed at all those bare, ridged muscles. One, two, three, four, five, six. Yes, an actual six-pack. His stomach made Channing Tatum seem pudgy. What was she doing? What was he doing? Oh, no, she was not going to have sex with this man again. He was frikkin nuts to think she was that stupid. \u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you, Max. You\u2019re delusional if you think we\u2019re going back to the beginning.\u201d</p><p>He toed off his shoes. \u201cOh, we\u2019re having sex. Right now. I was an idiot to wait this long and not show you how I feel. We could have a nice, tidy conversation in the kitchen but you wouldn\u2019t believe a word I said.\u201d His pants fell to his ankles and he kicked them aside. His erection bulged from his boxers. \u201cSo we\u2019ll do it a better way.\u201d His gaze pinned her to the wall. \u201cStrip.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carina gasped.

Who would\u2019ve thought you like to play hardball? But you do. Another reason you\u2019re perfect for me, and my other half. I needed a woman who wouldn\u2019t break, who\u2019d challenge me on all levels, especially in the bedroom.\u201d He pressed her against the wall and nipped at her earlobe. His hot breath rushed in her ear. \u201cA woman whose soul is pure and who knows how to laugh. A woman who gets me.\u201d His hands rested against her bodice and he played with the strappy part of her camisole. A pull here. A tug there. Carina bit back the moan of want and stiffened her resolve. If she won this round without giving in, she could walk out the door with her pride.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you the only way I know how that you\u2019re the only woman I want. You\u2019ve built too many barriers, baby. It\u2019s like stepping through a minefield, and I know it\u2019s all my fault. But your body can\u2019t lie to me. And you\u2019ll know mine can\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>He ripped the tank and tore it down the middle.</p> <p>Her breasts spilled free and he caught them with his palms, rubbing the tight crests as his lips devoured her mouth. One quick snap and her shorts and panties were off, leaving her naked in front of him. The rough play spiked her arousal so bad a trickle of wetness slid down her thigh, but she rallied and bit down on his lower lip.</p><p>He pulled away. His blue eyes darkened to a stormy gray and he deliberately twisted her nipples so a tiny bolt of pain zapped through her. Carina couldn\u2019t stop the moan falling from her lips. \u201cNot going to make it easy, are you?\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I like a challenge.\u201d</p><p>He turned her around and caged her with his thighs. His chest pressed to her back, and he nudged his erection against her cleft. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegs wider, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you.\u201d</p> <p>He kicked her legs apart with his foot until she was open wide and vulnerable. Her cheeks flushed as she scented her own arousal. His fingers glided downward over the curve of her backside, squeezing the tender flesh. She wiggled away but he only laughed. \u201cDoes this turn you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d His fingers dove deep and she arched. She fisted her hands and panted for control. Her cheek lay flat against the cool wall and the sheer helplessness of her position only racketed her need for more. The man claimed her heart and soul, but how had he gotten so deep into her fantasies? He played and teased until she writhed like a wild thing, ready to do anything for release. His lips nipped and licked the sensitive area of her nape and down her spine, and he rocked against her in a rhythm that drove her mad.</p><p>\u201cI want, I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. Truth time. Tell me you belong to me. Have always belonged to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He swirled the tight bud between her legs and her knees gave out. Max held her up with one arm but never stopped the merciless circles that kept her right on the edge. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>A sob caught in her throat. So close . . . the orgasm shimmered before her in all its glory until her nerves shredded and her brain fried. Her hips pressed back in torment. \u201cI hate you, Maximus Gray. I hate you.\u201d</p><p>His lips slid over her damp cheek. \u201cI love you, Carina. Do you hear me? I love you.\u201d He paused and lifted her up on her toes. \u201cNow come for me.\u201d</p><p>He sunk his fingers deep in her channel and rubbed hard. She cried out as waves of pleasure rocked through her and tore her to pieces. He lifted her, placed her on the bed, and fit himself with a condom. Then plunged.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Carina dug her heels into his back and gave him everything. He buried himself so deep inside there was nothing left but him. No gentleness marred the ferocity of his strokes. He drove her right back to the edge and shoved her over again.</p><p>His warmth and strength surrounded her. She floated and dimly noted his own release. Carina never let go of him as darkness finally crashed and she didn\u2019t have to think anymore.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Max stroked back her sweat-dampened hair and lay his cheek against hers. His hand cupped her breast, and one thigh tangled in between her legs. The scent of her clung to his skin. He wondered why it had taken him so long to realize he loved her. He understood why he had avoided love in the past. Yes, he had been afraid to make a commitment due to his father, afraid he had some of his genes, afraid he\u2019d hurt another woman like his mother had been hurt all those years ago. But the primary reason was simple.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>His heart no longer belonged to him. Was this how Carina had felt all those years? The torture and fear and joy of wanting to be in another\u2019s presence? He\u2019d give his life for her, but it still wasn\u2019t his choice to make. She lay next to him, her body his, but her mind still far, far away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She lifted his hand and pressed her lips against his palm. \u201cHow much you mean to me. All those times you walked through the door with Michael, I wondered what it would be like to be loved by you. To make love with you. I watched woman after woman parade in front of me and prayed for my turn. Now it\u2019s here, and I\u2019m too afraid to take it.\u201d</p><p>He rolled her over to face him. Chocolate brown eyes filled with a sadness and vulnerability that tore his heart. \u201cI love you. This isn\u2019t about doing the right thing, or not becoming like my father. I want a life with you and I won\u2019t settle for any other woman.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t react to his words. Her dark curly hair fell over her shoulders and revealed the slope of a stubborn chin, full cheeks, and long nose. She was strong and beautiful and perfect. Panic roared through his blood and dimmed his ears. \u201cCarina, please listen to me. I never thought I could be good enough for you. My age, our family, everything I believed myself to be. Now I see I could spend every day of my life making you happy you married me. Making myself worthy of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that, too, Max. But I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her silence rattled his nerves and hope for a happily-ever-after. What more could he give her? What more could she want? He studied her face and looked deep into her eyes.</p><p>Then he knew.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cI want to believe you. I think you even mean it this time. But I\u2019ll always wait for the drop. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll wonder all the time why you chose me. I look at you and my heart swells up and I don\u2019t know what to do with all my emotions. It still feels like I\u2019m sixteen and hoping to please you, or get a smile.\u201d</p><p>Coldness seeped through his skin. In a way, this wasn\u2019t even about him. This was about her own personal hang-ups and how she never felt good enough. Could he live like this? Always reassuring her or worried she\u2019d disappear because of her insecurities? Dio, what a complete mess. How did she not see how special she was? How he didn\u2019t deserve her? \u201cWe are no longer children, Carina. Isn\u2019t it time you truly realize that, and how others see you?\u201d The truth slammed him, and he sat up. \u201cYou are right, though. I need you to meet me halfway. I need a woman who believes in my love for her, who will stand by my side and won\u2019t be afraid something will take me away. I need someone strong and brave.\u201d His set his jaw and made his decision. \u201cYou are all that, my love. And more. But until you believe it, we don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her voice broke. With one graceful motion, she rose from the bed and stood naked before him. Resolution glimmered from dark eyes, along with a sliver of sadness that pierced his heart. \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t be with you right now. I need to know I\u2019m enough on my own before I can take this chance again. I\u2019m so sorry, Max. But I\u2019m leaving you.\u201d</p><p>She left him alone in his bedroom, staring at the closed door behind her. Left him wondering if he\u2019d ever be whole again. Left him wondering what would happen next.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Alexa supported baby Ethan in one arm while she settled into the canary yellow futon. Her gaze swept the high studio apartment with remembered fondness. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how fast time goes by,\u201d she commented. Her massive belly pulled at her maternity T-shirt that declared BOOKCRAZY BABY MAMA. \u201cYou have no idea how much wine was drunk in this apartment.\u201d</p><p>Maggie rocked Luke as she nursed him. Her sister-in-law gave a snort. \u201cOr how many of Alexa\u2019s dates ended badly. Wine was definitely needed.\u201d</p><p>The girls laughed and Carina adjusted the canvas she was working on. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a good head start. My Friday nights consist of chick-flick movies and a bottle of red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay away from our Friday night dinners, Carina,\u201d Alexa said. \u201cMax is barely civil anyway. Ever since you left him, Michael says he stomps around the office causing havoc, and is becoming like Miss Havisham in his big old mansion.\u201d</p><p>Carina shook her head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s good for me. I\u2019ve gotten so much work done.\u201d She stared at the painting in front of her\u2014the last of the series\u2014and shoved back tears. \u201cI miss him, though.\u201d</p><p>Maggie sighed. \u201cI know, honey. But I think you did the right thing. You\u2019ve been jonesing over Max your whole life, and it was always about what you could do for him. Marriage is a two-way street. You need to be strong on your own before you can be strong with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Alexa looked at her friend in amazement. \u201cDamn, that was deep.\u201d</p><p>Maggie grinned. \u201cThanks. Been practicing sensitivity for motherhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I told you I\u2019m looking for a full-time partner for BookCrazy,\u201d Alexa said. \u201cYou\u2019d be perfect, and I won\u2019t have to worry about Maggie filling in and chasing away my customers. I\u2019ve already been in touch with a lawyer. We can draw up the contracts as soon as you decide.\u201d</p><p>Excitement curled in her belly. For the first time, she\u2019d discovered a talent that made her money and made her happy. Now, with the final painting in the collection, she was ready to take another big leap. She\u2019d placed a call to Sawyer, and a consultant was coming to look at her work. She\u2019d been warned the advisor was brutal, and if there wasn\u2019t a chance at a sale, he\u2019d tell her straight up. Carina was thrilled\u2014she wanted honesty and knew if her art wasn\u2019t up to par, she\u2019d work harder the next time. Finally, her life began to shift and take focus.</p><p>Except for missing her husband.</p><p>A piece inside of her seemed to be permanently broken without him. Since the day she left, he hadn\u2019t contacted her. Ten days dragged on until it seemed she\u2019d go mad if she couldn\u2019t see his face. He haunted her dreams at night and during the day. She managed to pour most of her angst into her work and hoped the gritty feel of her portraits translated to the regular onlooker. It was funny how heartbreak turned into great art.</p><p>Carina brought herself back to the present. \u201cI\u2019d love to be part owner of BookCrazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you for trusting me, Alexa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you kidding? You worked your ass off and proved yourself. I give nothing for free.\u201d</p><p>Maggie nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s a pushover with kids and dogs, but a shark when it comes to business.\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed. \u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how is Gabby doing? She looks completely healed,\u201d Maggie said.</p> <p>Carina glanced at the dove who cooed in her cage. Gabby liked to listen to the other birds in the trees outside and seemed content to stay close to her side. But Carina knew it was almost time to let her go. The wing had fully healed, and her owner wanted her back. A tiny flare of uncertainty rippled through her. Maybe Gabby needed some more time. Maybe she wasn\u2019t ready yet.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be ready to fly soon.\u201d</p><p>Alexa sighed. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a dove as a pet, but the dogs would probably get jealous.\u201d</p><p>Maggie snored. \u201cYeah, my brother with a bird. He almost killed the fish. That\u2019s a disaster in the making.\u201d</p><p>Alexa stuck out her tongue.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we have to get going. Just wanted to stop by and make sure you\u2019re okay.\u201d Carina kissed them and her nephews good-bye. Maggie squeezed her hand. \u201cJust remember, we\u2019re here if you need us. Any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, guys.\u201d</p><p>Carina watched them walk away with a heavy heart. Then she got back to work.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Carina clicked off her cell phone with trembling fingers.</p><p>She got a show.</p> <p>She let out a whoop and jumped around the room, throwing in hip-hop moves and general butt shaking. The consultant had torn her work apart and pointed out every item that wouldn\u2019t close a sale. She took the criticism with her chin up and a steel core. Told him she\u2019d do better next time.</p><p>He nodded, gave her his card, and left.</p><p>One week later, Sawyer called with the news that his friend couldn\u2019t get her work out of his mind. He wanted her to tweak some things, create one more original piece, and he\u2019d give her a shot. Giddiness popped like soda bubbles until she\u2019d imagined she could fly. Carina stared at her BlackBerry and paused on the number.</p><p>She wanted to call Max.</p><p>Not her mother, or Michael, or Maggie. She wanted to call her husband, who probably wouldn\u2019t be her husband any longer. The one who told her to paint for her happiness, and that she was so much more than she thought she was.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door.</p><p>Heart pounding, she decided Fate had sent her an answer. If it was Max, she\u2019d leap into his arms and beg forgiveness. Carina walked over and opened the door.</p><p>Her mother stood on the threshold.</p> <p>Her shoulders slumped, but she managed a cheery smile. \u201cHi, Mama. I\u2019m glad you are here. I have wonderful news.\u201d</p><p>With a kiss on the cheek, her mother\u2019s cane pounded on the scarred wooden floors. \u201cTell me. You seem happy.\u201d</p><p>Carina told her the news. The pride on her mother\u2019s face satisfied something deep inside. \u201cI knew you would make a success of your painting. You have been very focused these past few weeks. May I see them?\u201d</p><p>Panic nibbled on her nerves. \u201cUmm, I\u2019ll show you when I am finished. You can see them at the show.\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte shook her head. \u201cI am sorry, Carina, that is why I\u2019ve come to talk to you. I\u2019m ready to go home. I will return by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The tiny sound seemed pathetic even to her ears. She\u2019d gotten used to having her mom around. Friday night dinners were boisterous, and like a divorced couple, she and Max alternated each Friday night to give the other a chance with the family. With a deep sigh, her mother leaned her cane against the couch and sat on the battered cushions. \u201cAre you feeling okay, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Just tired and ready to see my home.\u201d</p><p>Carina smiled and sat down next to her mother. She took her weathered hand and clasped it within hers. Hands that baked and rocked babies and soothed tears. Hands that build a strong business by kneading dough and juggling a dozen balls in the air at once. \u201cI understand. I\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will you be okay here without me? Do you want to come home?\u201d</p><p>She pressed a kiss to her mother\u2019s hand. \u201cNo. I\u2019m building my home here on my own terms. I feel stronger. More like a woman who knows what she wants and less like a girl.\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte sighed. \u201cBecause your heart was broken. We age faster that way. Neither good nor bad. It just is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I must tell you something about Maximus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush, just listen. When you were little, you used to stare after that boy with your heart in your eyes. I knew with you it was a forever love, not a crush. But you were too young, and Maximus is a good boy. His job was to protect you until you were a woman. And he did.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled at the memory. \u201cI always saw the way he looked at you. When he thought no one was looking and he was safe. With a wistful, loving glance that filled my heart. I knew time needed to pass in order to do its job with both of you. I know there were heartaches, but they were necessary to get you here. The morning I walked in on you, I mentioned marriage for one specific reason. I knew he needed the push. He was too afraid of Michael, and of your past relationship. Something needed to break that barrier to give you two a chance. I may have suggested it, but that man does what he wants, and no sense of honor would have had him ask for your hand in marriage if he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cMax loves you. But now it\u2019s your turn to make a decision. You need to be strong enough to stand beside him and ask for his love. You\u2019re going to have to take a chance on yourself. We all believe in you. Isn\u2019t it time you believe in yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mama. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed deeply and looked out the window. \u201cI hoped it would work out differently, but did not plan on you being so stubborn. Of course, I had the same problem with Michael and Maggie, but thank goodness that worked out.\u201d</p><p>Carina tilted her head. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Mama Conte cackled. \u201cOh, my, I knew when they showed up they lied about being married. I also knew they were perfect together, so I arranged the priest to come to the house.\u201d</p><p>Carina\u2019s mouth fell open. Her mother had fallen sick and requested Maggie and Michael to be married in front of her. Amazing. The whole time her mother knew everything, and planned her own coup.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ruthless. Why didn\u2019t I know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mother. We do what we need for our children when they need a push. Now if I can only get Julietta to look at a man rather than a spreadsheet.\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>Carina reached out and took her mother in her arms. The familiar scent of baking and powder and comfort swarmed around her and soothed her soul. \u201cI love you, Mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, my sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>They stayed in each other\u2019s arms for a while before Carina felt strong enough to let go.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was time.</p><p>Carina stood outside with Gabby on her arm.</p><p>The sun poured warm over her skin and the dove\u2019s white feathers gleamed. \u201cI love you, sweet girl.\u201d She stroked her downy chest. The bird cocked her head and cooed as if sensing her good-bye. Carina hesitated. She knew she\u2019d never see Gabby again, knew she\u2019d fly to her home and leave her behind, completely healed.</p><p>The lightbulb moment clicked on and splintered in a thousand pieces.</p><p>Max loved her.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she doubted herself for too long? When was it time to grab for her happiness, with a clear understanding she was deserving of Maximus Gray and everything he had to offer? These past few weeks without him showed her she could stand on her own now. Go after her dreams. Fail and not fall apart. Ask for what she wanted without fear.</p><p>She could live without him, but she didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Her husband loved her, but he needed a woman who was worthy. She never believed in herself enough to give him everything, always afraid he\u2019d realize she wasn\u2019t good enough.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s words swirled in her head and made her dizzy.</p><p>Isn\u2019t it time you believe in yourself?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to fly, Gabby.\u201d</p><p>Carina threw up her arm. The dove\u2019s wings flapped and she took flight. Soaring gracefully up into the sky, her white wings stark against the wood of the trees, she watched her disappear. Fat puffy clouds floated by, until there was nothing left.</p><p>Her tummy steadied. A deep knowledge pulsed from within. She trusted the instinct and realized it was time to move forward. Time to be the woman she was always meant to be.</p><p>Time to claim her husband.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Max looked up at the sign over the trendy gallery in SoHo.</p><p>Carina\u2019s name was scrawled in fancy calligraphy, and cheery white lights strung around the outside of the space caught the attention of onlookers. He dragged in a lungful of air and hoped he had enough strength to get through the evening.</p><p>The invitation to her first show was both startling and ironic. Pride choked him. His talented, beautiful wife finally knew her worth and he wasn\u2019t here to celebrate with her. But he couldn\u2019t deny the need to see her one more time in her glory. Needed to lay his gaze on her work, while he remembered making love to her in the workroom as he covered her in chocolate body paint.</p><p>His gut coiled into a solid ball of regret.</p><p>Max opened the door and walked in.</p><p>The space was large and open, with wide pillars naturally separating the room into quadrants. A full bar and cocktail waiters strolled around giving out champagne, wine, and a variety of appetizers. Crowds milled around in various groups, chatting and laughing as they made their way around the room. His gaze went directly to the right corner, almost as if he scented her presence.</p><p>She threw back her head and laughed at something a man said. Her long black dress shimmered under the light. Her dark curls were pinned up high on her head and tamed, but Max knew one slide of the pin would make that silky mess tumble over her shoulders in wild abandon. Her eyes glowed with an inner joy and confidence he\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>Yes. She was happy without him.</p><p>Choking back his emotion, he turned away and walked to the first display.</p><p>Shock held him immobile.</p><p>He expected portraits with heart and soul, an easy warmth she always translated in the few pieces of her work he\u2019d been lucky enough to see. These seemed like they were from a different artist.</p><p>Raw and gritty, shadowed in black, gray, and an occasional slice of red, the couples on the canvas were displayed in different erotic poses. A woman arched against the wall as her lover pressed his lips to her naked breasts. The bodies pulsed with an earthy sensuality but teetered right on the border, as the window sketched on the right seemed to be a mirror between privacy and the outside world. The onlooker seemed almost a voyeur to the scene, stretching the mind enough so one needed to keep looking at the painting.</p><p>As Max moved from one to another, the couple seemed caught in a web of the relationship. One canvas sketched out the vulnerability and want on the woman\u2019s face as she gazed at her lover. His harsh profile showed nothing but hard lines and a steely resolve. Another detailed the couple with foreheads touching, lips a whisper away, eyes hooded from the viewer so he was forced to imagine what they were thinking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Max gazed at each painting with a hunger he rarely felt. The work was extraordinary, and he realized his wife\u2019s talent crackled with a passion and depth that could rock the entire art world. He was looking at the beginning of a long, successful career. No wonder Sawyer sounded so excited. He\u2019d discovered the latest hot new artist on the block.</p><p>People swarmed around him and tried to engage him in conversation. Waiters stopped and asked if he needed anything. He never answered. Just soaked up her work and felt as if he knew the last secret part of her soul she kept hidden. Now, it revealed itself in full naked glory.</p><p>Dio, he loved her.</p><p>He arrived early to make sure he avoided Alexa, Nick, Michael, and Maggie. His plan was ridiculous and all male. Sneak in, see her work, torture himself, and sneak back out. Go home and get rip-roaring drunk with his dog at his feet.</p> <p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>Her voice rang in his ears. Husky like Eve. Sweet like an angel. He clenched his teeth and turned.</p><p>She smiled at him with such warmth he thought he\u2019d get sunburn. Primitive need wracked through him like convulsions but he fought it off and managed to smile back. \u201cHi, Carina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a shoulder. \u201cI had to see.\u201d</p> <p>Why did she look at him with such greed? To torture him? \u201cI\u2019m glad. What did you think?\u201d</p><p>His voice ripped from his throat. \u201cThey are . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>She blinked as if fighting tears, and another piece of his heart tore off. He\u2019d have nothing left by the end of the conversation. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the final one. It\u2019s back here under a separate display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Carina. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Please, Max. I need to show you.\u201d</p><p>Was this what love felt like? A wrenching pain that pushed you underwater like a riptide and refused to let you surface? He swallowed back his second protest and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>He followed her toward the back of the room and up a few steps. The gallery opened up to a showcase under a spotlight. The painting hung from the ceiling in single splendor. Max took a step forward and looked up.</p><p>It was him.</p><p>The title boldly slashed across the top: Maximus. Bare-chested. Barefoot. Jeans riding low on hips. Features half blurred and cast in shadow, he stared straight into the onlooker\u2019s eyes and held his gaze. A swirling array of emotions ravaged his face, his eyes a storm of such power Max was rocked to the core. He saw everything in that glance. Vulnerability. Determination. A hint of arrogance. Need. And an ability to love.</p><p>His heart squeezed. He turned.</p><p>Carina stood before him, those inky eyes full of adoration and love and a strength he\u2019d never seen. \u201cI love you, Max. I\u2019ve always loved you, but I needed to love me before I could give you what you need. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late, but I promise if you give me another chance, I\u2019ll stand by your side and be the woman you deserve. Because I am that woman. The other half of your soul. The question was never will I come back to you. The question is, will you come back to me?\u201d</p><p>Joy exploded and pumped through his veins. He gave a half laugh and pulled her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve never left, cara.\u201d</p><p>He claimed her mouth and kissed her deeply, tenderly, as if they sealed their vows from that Vegas wedding months ago.</p><p>Suddenly, the family of his heart surrounded him. Max got pulled into a tight circle while Michael and Nick pounded his back and Alexa and Maggie wiped away tears.</p> <p>He was finally, truly, home.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you got back together.\u201d Alexa sniffled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stand the drama any longer. Friday nights were beginning to suck.\u201d</p><p>Max held Carina tight to his side and laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll clear that up this week. Party at our house.\u201d</p><p>The consultant hurried over and broke through the line. His normally staid expression slipped. \u201cUmm, Carina, can I talk to you a sec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She kissed Max hard on the lips and stepped away. After a whispered conversation, she returned with a dazed look. \u201cI sold out.\u201d</p><p>Max grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Your work blew me away. But we better get started\u2014you\u2019re going to have to paint a lot more and I need to give you inspiration.\u201d</p><p>She giggled and buried her fingers in his hair. \u201cBring it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Max looked at the woman he loved. His wife. His soul mate. His forever.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>She lay in a tangle of sheets, exhuasted, sated, and happier than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cFinally ready to call uncle?\u201d</p><p>Carina raised her head one inch off the pillow and collapsed back. \u201cNever. I just need a minute.\u201d</p><p>He laughed low and slid off the bed. She heard footsteps pad to the walk-in closet, then come back. His musky scent rose to her nostrils and made her stir again. Damned if her husband hadn\u2019t made her into a nympho, and she loved every moment.</p><p>\u201cI have a present for you.\u201d</p><p>That made her sit up. The girly part of her melted at the idea of her husband buying her a gift. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was saving it. Hoping you\u2019d come back and I\u2019d be able to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>The rectangular box was wrapped in bold red paper. She bit her lip in pleasure and stared at the box. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it, babe.\u201d</p><p>She ripped at the paper like a kid on Christmas and lifted the lid.</p><p>Sucked in her breath.</p><p>A pair of shoes lay in the white tissue paper. Not just any shoes. These were four-inch stiletto heels lined in diamonds. Made of pure glass.</p><p>She lifted one up in the air and watched the gems sparkle. The peekaboo toe gave the shoes a flirty sexiness, and the delicate glass felt smooth to the touch. \u201cMy God, Max, you outdid yourself. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me once you never got the happily-ever-after you always wanted. I thought I\u2019d try making up for it by giving you a real pair of Cinderella shoes.\u201d</p><p>Tears prickled her lids and she sniffed. \u201cDamn you, Maximus Gray. Who would\u2019ve thought there was all this mushy romance hidden under that exterior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Carina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his forehead to his wife\u2019s and vowed to never make her doubt his feelings again.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Maggie sighed and looked around the living room. \u201cAre there too many children in this room, or am I losing it?\u201d</p><p>Carina laughed and stuck the binky into Maria\u2019s mouth. Her scream ended midair and she sucked with greed. Lily tore around the room playing with her stuffed Dora and Boots while Nick Jr. blared in the background. The two Pack \u2019n Plays held Ethan and Luke, who had just been fed and changed. \u201cWait till Max and I enter the ring. We\u2019ll have to start a babysitting chain so we see daylight with our spouses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d Alexa gasped. She held a fake teacup in hand and pretended to drink while Lily giggled.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not ready yet. I\u2019m working on another show, and Max has a new bakery opening. We\u2019re enjoying ourselves now. In fact, we\u2019re flying to Italy in a month to stay a while. We both miss our moms.\u201d</p><p>Maggie sighed. \u201cI miss Mama Conte too. But the babies are too young for a trip. How\u2019s Julietta doing? Still not dating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister is quite negative about the opposite sex. Seems she\u2019s convinced a man will take away her control and try to strip her career. She\u2019s stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Alexa laughed. \u201cMaybe she needs a love spell. Earth Mother seemed quite generous with Maggie and me.\u201d</p><p>Maggie threw a stuffed puppy and hit her in the head. Alexa stuck out her tongue.</p><p>Love spell.</p><p>A funny sense of Fate tickled her spine. Her eyes widened as she remembered that night when she built the fire and threw the paper in it. A paper that held one name: Maximus Gray.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out on her arms and she held Maria closer for warmth. \u201cUmm, guys? What are you talking about? When Maggie gave me that spell book, she said it was just silly nonsense and no one used it.\u201d</p><p>Alexa hooted with laughter. \u201cPriceless! Miss Maggie finally owned up and told me she cast her own spell for a man before she married Michael. How the cynical have fallen.\u201d</p><p>Maggie shrugged. \u201cSo what? Yes, it\u2019s a coincidence. But Carina threw the spell book out and now she\u2019s happily married to Max. So it was just a fluke our husbands came after we addressed Earth Mother.\u201d</p><p>Carina swallowed. \u201cI lied, Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cast a love spell. A few nights after, I snuck into the woods and completed the cycle. I burned my paper in the fire.\u201d</p><p>The room grew silent. Even the babies seemed to sense something big on the horizon, and the quiet Max &amp; Ruby cartoon came on to add to the hush. \u201cDid you write all the qualities you wanted in a husband?\u201d Alexa whispered. \u201cDoes Max fit your list?\u201d</p><p>Carina looked at the two women and swallowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t list any qualities. I only wrote down his name on the piece of paper.\u201d</p><p>Maggie jumped as if she\u2019d seen a ghost. Alexa leaned back against the slate blue cushion and shook her head. \u201cHoly crap. The spell works.\u201d</p><p>Maggie laughed, but it had a hollow ring. \u201cImpossible. We\u2019re being ridiculous. Stop spooking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the book, Carina? Did you give it to someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s in my bookshelf with a whole bunch of other stuff. I never threw it away.\u201d</p><p>Alexa\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI think we need to safely deliver that book to someone. Namely your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Julietta would never complete a love spell. She\u2019s the practical one in the family. It couldn\u2019t really work.\u201d She paused. \u201cCould it?\u201d</p><p>Maggie tapped her chin with interest. \u201cInteresting idea. Carina\u2019s going to Italy in a month. Maybe she can find a way to make sure Julietta completes the spell. Then we\u2019ll finally know. Two could be coincidence. Three could be far-fetched, but possible. Four times would be a confirmation.\u201d</p><p>Carina glanced at the two women. They were right. Her sister deserved this type of happiness, and if completing a love spell pushed Julietta in the right direction, it was worth a try.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Maggie grabbed three wineglasses, poured the rich Chianti, and handed them out. They lifted their glasses to the circle and smiled.</p><p>\u201cSalute.\u201d</p><p>Carina drank.</p><p>The children played and slept. The women chattered and laughed. The men strolled in for an occasional kiss or teasing remark. When Carina looked at her husband, he smiled at her with a gentleness and heat that made her whole. Her marriage mistake gave her everything she\u2019d ever dreamed of.</p><p>Her happily-ever-after. </p> </body></html>"]
