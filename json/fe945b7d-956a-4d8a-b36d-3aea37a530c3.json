Everyone knew that it was a home for freaks.</p><p>Witches, psychics, necromancers, Sentinels, and God only knew what else roamed the grounds protected by a layer of powerful spells. It was a source of fear and fascination for the entire world, but most especially for the citizens of the small, Midwest town who could catch the shimmer of blue reflecting off the protective dome that hid the house from view. And even glimpse the rare sight of the freaks entering and leaving the compound, although people were smart enough to spy on them from a distance.</p><p>There were, of course, citizens who called for the entire place to be nuked.</p><p>The freaks were dangerous, with powers that none of them truly understood. Who knew what the monsters would do if someone pissed them off?</p><p>There were others who said they should be locked away and studied like lab rats. Perhaps their mutations could be used to help normal people.</p> <p>Most, however, preferred to ignore Valhalla and the high-bloods\u2014as they preferred to be called\u2014living behind the dome.</p><p>Until, of course, they needed them.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>The nightclub near the University of Missouri wasn\u2019t anything to brag about. Hell, it wasn\u2019t much more than a leaking roof held up by four walls and a prayer. In the center was a cramped dance floor surrounded by tables and at the back a long bar ran the length of the wall. Up the narrow staircase you could find pool tables and a few old-time pinball machines, while in the back parking lot the dealers strolled from car to car, searching for shoppers interested in less legal means of intoxication.</p><p>A typical college hangout.</p><p>Seated in a booth nearly obscured by shadows, Angela Locke watched the crowd of college students bump and grind to a heavy beat that was making her eye twitch.</p> <p>Not that she wasn\u2019t enjoying herself, she sternly chided herself. She might be a few years older than most of the kids in the club, but that didn\u2019t mean she was a complete party pooper. Right?</p><p>On cue she winced as two girls shrieked with laughter at a nearby table, the aggravating sound some sort of homing signal to the guys who eagerly crowded around their table.</p><p>Okay, this wasn\u2019t really her scene.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the majority of her twenty-six years in musty libraries or high-tech labs, which meant she was more comfortable with petri dishes and microscopes than the opposite sex.</p><p>Her dark thoughts were interrupted as she belatedly realized she was no longer alone.</p><p>Glancing up, she met Megan Wagner\u2019s exasperated frown. The pretty, pleasantly rounded blonde was one of Angela\u2019s few friends at the university. In the process of recovering from a disastrous marriage, the older woman was taking classes to earn her teaching degree.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Megan complained. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you here to hide in the corner.\u201d</p><p>Angela wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019d rather hide in corners than park myself in the spotlight where everyone can see me sitting alone.\u201d</p> <p>Megan folded her arms under her ample bosom, her lush curves displayed in a tight red dress and her blonde curls allowed to fall freely over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be alone if you didn\u2019t put out vibes that you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA geek? A nerd? A first-class egghead?\u201d Angela offered wryly.</p><p>\u201cUnavailable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Angela shot a glance down at her jade stretchy top that was scooped low enough to reveal the soft curve of her breasts and the too-tight jeans that threatened her circulation. \u201cIn this outfit I not only look available, I look like I charge by the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your clothes. It\u2019s your attitude.\u201d</p><p>Angela blinked. Attitude? She didn\u2019t know she had an attitude.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Megan placed her hands flat on the table, eying Angela with the same stern expression she used on her students at the local preschool.</p><p>\u201cPay attention to the men who are here, not the one who isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Angela tried to squelch the renegade blush that stole beneath her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that it\u2019s all fine and dandy to moon over Professor Hottie, but what\u2019s it gotten you?\u201d A blonde brow arched. \u201cUnless there\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>Angela ducked her head, allowing her finger to trace the beads of moisture that trickled down her untouched drink.</p><p>Professor Hottie.</p><p>Or, better known as Dr. Nikolo Bartrev.</p><p>He\u2019d arrived at the university six weeks before. A tall, dark stranger who\u2019d been invited by the president to review their science curriculum. Angela didn\u2019t know precisely what his work entailed, but she did know that one glance into those pale blue eyes and she\u2019d been lost.</p><p>Head over heels in lust for the first time in her life.</p><p>A damned shame he didn\u2019t return her aching need.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the point,\u201d Megan pressed. \u201cHe stops by your lab once a day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it\u2019s twice.\u201d</p><p>Megan snorted. \u201cHe makes a little chitchat and disappears.\u201d</p><p>Angela hunched a shoulder. It was true enough.</p><p>The first time Dr. Bartrev had strolled into her lab she\u2019d nearly had a heart attack. She\u2019d just finished teaching a freshman biology class and he\u2019d waited for the giggling girls to drag themselves past him before he slowly approached her desk.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known what to expect, but after a few minutes of questioning her about her research, he\u2019d turned and left.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Since that day, he\u2019d made a habit of stopping by when she was in the lab, sometimes discussing her research and other times just randomly discussing her day.</p><p>She assumed that he was cleverly extracting information from her to use in his assessment, but she didn\u2019t have a clue what he was searching for.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>His fleeting visits were enough to make her giddy for the rest of the day.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHas he ever revealed anything remotely personal about himself?\u201d</p><p>Angela grimaced. After six weeks she didn\u2019t know a damned thing about the man.</p><p>Well, she knew the precise scent of his warm male cologne. And the way his cashmere sweaters stretched over a wide chest and how his pants clung to his tight ass.</p><p>But anything about the man beneath the gorgeous exterior? Nothing. Nada. Niente.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he ever asked you out, even to lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he ever brought you anything? Flowers, candy, a bagel from the cafeteria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he tried to get his hand down your shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Megan heaved a sigh. \u201cHoney, that man ain\u2019t interested, no matter how much you might want him to be.\u201d</p><p>Angela lifted her head to meet her friend\u2019s sympathetic gaze. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The blonde grabbed the plastic sword that held a candied cherry from Angela\u2019s glass.</p><p>\u201cThen drink your gin fizz and give that nice stud muffin by the door a big smile.\u201d She pointed the sword toward the delectable blond Neanderthal standing across the dance floor. \u201cAnd remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Angela rolled her eyes. She had a mirror. She might not be the Bride of Frankenstein, but she was a long way from beautiful.</p><p>Average brown hair she kept in a ponytail. Average height with average curves. Average features that were pale from the hours she spent in the lab.</p><p>The only thing remarkable was the wide brown eyes that were heavily framed with dark lashes, but most of the time they were hidden behind her protective lab glasses.</p><p>In summation she was . . . average.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than one gin fizz to make me believe in fairy tales,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a kiss will wake you, Sleeping Beauty.\u201d Megan waggled her brows. \u201cShe was, after all, the first true wallflower.\u201d</p><p>Angela gave a choked laugh. Her friend charged through life at full throttle.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be like you, Megan,\u201d she said wistfully, thinking of all the nights she sat in her cramped apartment alone.</p><p>Always alone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Megan scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius who\u2019s only weeks away from receiving your PhD in molecular biology and I\u2019m trying to struggle through my undergraduate degree.\u201d</p><p>Angela shook her head. Because of finances Megan was forced to take night classes while she worked full-time, but there was no doubt her love for children would allow her to achieve her goals.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re a fabulous teacher, not to mention . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s comforting words dissolved into a silent shock as her heart slammed against her ribs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh hell.</p><p>\u201cHey, that was just getting good,\u201d Megan grumbled. Then, noticing that Angela\u2019s attention had strayed, she frowned in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did Professor Lewis get drunk again and take off his pants?\u201d</p><p>Angela reached for her glass to take a deep drink of the gin fizz.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiko.\u201d She grimaced as the overly sweet drink hit her empty stomach. \u201cI mean, Professor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHottie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>Helplessly she watched his determined approach.</p><p>Oh . . . crap, but he was gorgeous. From the tip of his glossy dark hair that was threaded with hints of autumn fire and tousled as if he\u2019d just run his hands through the short strands, to the tips of his Italian shoes.</p><p>His lean face was perfectly carved with a wide brow and narrow nose. His cheekbones were angular, hinting at his Slavic origins, and his jaw surprisingly stubborn with just a shadow of stubble from his heavy beard.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination \u201cpretty.\u201d His features were too hard, too ruthless, for that. But there was something compellingly beautiful about his sheer maleness, and when he offered one of his rare smiles . . . well, there wasn\u2019t a female on campus who didn\u2019t do a little melting.</p><p>He was dark and broody and delectable. The sort of man who haunted the fantasies of every repressed virgin.</p><p>And if she\u2019d caught sight of a menacing glint in the piercing blue eyes that spoke of hidden power and predatory danger, well, she\u2019d convinced herself that it only made him more exciting.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I have to admit he is lickable,\u201d Megan grudgingly conceded, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cLike a double-fudge ice cream cone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan,\u201d Angela protested, although she couldn\u2019t deny the desire to tug off his blue sweater and gray Chinos to do a bit of tongue therapy.</p><p>Megan turned back to stab her with a warning gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s also gay or married.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he hasn\u2019t tried to get you in bed.\u201d Megan leaned toward her. \u201cDon\u2019t let him ruin your night.\u201d</p><p>With a tug on Angela\u2019s hair, that was for once left to brush her shoulders, Megan was disappearing toward the bar, leaving Angela alone to face the man now towering beside her table.</p><p>\u201cHello, Angela,\u201d he greeted, his voice a dark velvet rasp that sent renegade shivers of excitement down her spine.</p><p>Oh . . . crap.</p> <p>She licked her dry lips, trying to squash the embarrassing thrills of excitement.</p><p>\u201cDr. Bartrev,\u201d she breathed, her voice barely audible over the music blasting from the overhead speakers.</p><p>With a fluid ease, he perched on the edge of the table, his hard thigh brushing her arm.</p><p>\u201cI thought we agreed to Niko?\u201d</p><p>Yeah. She was so not going down that road.</p><p>He was Niko in her fantasies. In real life . . . well, she needed to avoid making an idiot of herself.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cI could say the same.\u201d His brooding gaze shifted to the surrounding crowd that was amping up the loud factor with every round of tequila. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your usual style.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMegan convinced me this was my last chance to get out and party before everyone leaves for spring break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The piercing blue eyes returned to study her upturned face. Angela shivered beneath the sheer intensity of that gaze. He had an uncanny habit of appearing completely focused on whatever he was doing. \u201cA girls\u2019 night out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d She managed a smile. Play it cool, Angela. It\u2019s not attractive to drool all over the handsome professor. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was concerned.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cConcerned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She sucked in a sharp breath, suddenly struck by a terrifying thought. \u201cIs there something wrong with my research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour work is flawless. As always,\u201d he swiftly eased her fear, a strange edge in his voice although she was too relieved to notice. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll discuss later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, almost as if considering his words.</p><p>\u201cI heard rumors there was a stalker in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stalker?\u201d She blinked in surprise. The small Midwest town had its share of petty crime, but violence was extremely rare. \u201cIn town or on campus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe person has been seen on campus as well as in the surrounding neighborhoods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything. Have the police been notified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His gaze swept down to her breasts that were on blatant display, and just for a moment she thought she might have seen a flicker of heat in the icy depths. Then, clearly unimpressed, he returned his interest to her flushed face. \u201cYou haven\u2019t noticed anything unusual, have you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, telling herself she didn\u2019t give a damn. \u201cNot that I can think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere haven\u2019t been any strangers lurking around?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted in a humorless smile. \u201cMost people will tell you that I\u2019m not the most observant person,\u201d she said, recalling her mother\u2019s resigned complaint that Angela could recite the periodic table when she was barely five, but didn\u2019t know the name of one classmate. She hastily squashed the age-old pain before it could fully form. Her mother\u2019s death last year meant that the older woman could no longer be disappointed in her only child. \u201cOutside the lab I tend to be distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when you\u2019re home?\u201d he demanded. \u201cHave you seen anyone new in the neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She frowned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t the police be asking these questions?\u201d</p><p>His smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to spook the students so I agreed to do a bit of discreet investigating for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It seemed weird to have a visiting professor investigating a potential stalker, but what did she know? \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket to pull out a pen, scribbling on a piece of napkin.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he murmured, folding the paper before he lightly pressed it into her unresisting fingers.</p><p>Angela\u2019s heart slammed against her ribs as pleasure exploded through her. Her head might warn her to stop weaving futile fantasies about this man, but her body hadn\u2019t received the memo.</p><p>His fingers were hot\u2014shockingly hot\u2014against her skin. A branding heat that sent darts of excitement to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>And his scent was wrapping around her like a cloak of invitation.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she husked, becoming lost in the astonishing blue of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy phone number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to call me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart gave another stuttering leap. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She licked her suddenly dry lips. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very minute you notice anything out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>Shit. She came back to earth with a resounding crash.</p><p>The stalker. Right.</p><p>She lowered her head, determined he wouldn\u2019t guess her flare of humiliation.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you notice anything,\u201d he insisted. \u201cNo matter how small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d</p><p>Without warning his hand was cupping her chin, tilting her face up so he could study her with a faint frown.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>There was another jolt of sensation before she was pulling free of his destructive touch and rising to her feet with a stubborn expression.</p><p>\u201cCross my heart and hope to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find Megan.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Standing near the railing of the second floor of the nightclub, Nikolo studied the throng of people that moved below him.</p><p>College students jerked and hopped around the dance floor while townies and aging professors lined the bar at the back.</p><p>Over and over, his gaze skimmed the swarm of norms before returning to the slender brunette who\u2019d moved to a front table with her friend.</p><p>He didn\u2019t worry about the aggravating scientist catching sight of him. He couldn\u2019t actually make himself invisible, but he could . . . convince people not to notice him.</p><p>It was a talent of most Sentinels. Along with heightened senses, predatory instincts, and a cunning patience that would allow him to track his prey from one end of the world to other if necessary.</p><p>He also had the ability to sense when a high-blood was near.</p><p>Of course, the public was far more accustomed to the Sentinels who performed as guardians to high-bloods. Those Sentinels were raised and trained by monks in mysterious arts that were never spoken of outside the monasteries. They were also heavily tattooed to protect them from being controlled by psychics or attacked with spells.</p><p>They were lethal beasts, but they were also ridiculously noticeable in a crowd. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Massive killers tattooed from the top of their bald heads to the tips of their toes tended to attract attention.</p><p>Which is why the Sentinels also needed hunters who could travel unnoticed.</p><p>Hunters like him. Oh, and the man currently standing a few feet away.</p> <p>Never allowing his gaze to stray from Angela Locke, he gave a tiny motion of his hand. All high-bloods understood you didn\u2019t approach a Sentinel when he was locked on his prey.</p><p>Bad, bad things could happen.</p><p>\u201cArel,\u201d he murmured, recognizing the scent of the fellow Sentinel.</p><p>The younger man stepped forward, the flashing strobe lights shimmering over the honey highlights in his light brown hair and turning his eyes to molten gold.</p><p>Most humans dismissed Arel as a charming playboy. A role he performed with consummate skill. But those trained to look beneath the surface could detect the muscles honed to lean perfection beneath his casual T-shirt and faded jeans, and the ruthless determination that simmered deep in the gold eyes.</p> <p>\u201cDylan?\u201d Arel murmured softly.</p><p>Niko grimaced at the mention of the female high-blood they\u2019d been hunting for the past six weeks.</p><p>\u201cStill in the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you positive she\u2019ll show up here?\u201d</p><p>Niko didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re always right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Arel snorted. \u201cYou know you\u2019re an arrogant SOB, don\u2019t you, Niko?\u201d</p><p>Niko shrugged. Yep, he knew. But his confidence wasn\u2019t just conceit.</p><p>From the second Dylan had murdered her two guards to escape from Valhalla, he\u2019d dedicated every waking moment to studying his prey.</p><p>He knew the day and hour Dylan had been born. He knew that she\u2019d been less than a week old when her parents had left her in the field outside Valhalla. He knew that she nursed a bitter fury at having been abandoned by her family despite her welcome among the high-bloods. Perhaps because she was one of the unfortunate freaks that had been born with a mutation that left her with startling crimson eyes and large black spots on her skin, like a cheetah. Unlike many high-bloods she\u2019d been unable to pass as norm, which only increased her resentment.</p><p>Or maybe she\u2019d just been born a psychopath.</p><p>Being given special powers didn\u2019t mean that a person was automatically a superhero.</p><p>High-bloods possessed all the usual failings of norms. Only they could do a hell of a lot more damage if they weren\u2019t contained.</p> <p>Which was where Niko and his fellow Sentinels came in.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI know what she\u2019s going to do before she does,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think because she\u2019d been searching through Calder\u2019s files on your scientist that she\u2019s coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Niko had been baffled at first when he\u2019d discovered that Dylan had been sneaking into the Master of Gifts\u2019 office. Calder and his order were dedicated to tracking down those high-bloods who either didn\u2019t realize they were \u201cspecial\u201d or were trying to pass as normal. Like a Sentinel they possessed the ability to sense talents, even latent talents, although they used their skills to convince high-bloods to join with their brethren at Valhalla, or in one of the many compounds located around the world. While Niko . . . well, his duties weren\u2019t quite so nice.</p><p>At last he\u2019d put together the reasons for Dylan\u2019s late-night visits to Calder\u2019s office.</p><p>And it had everything to do with Angela Locke.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m questioning your conclusion, amigo,\u201d Arel said in dry tones, \u201cbut why is she currently on a killing spree through Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to disguise her true purpose and throw us off her trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor six weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always been patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Arel\u2019s features hardened, his charming smile replaced by a cold hatred. Both Niko and Arel had reason to want Dylan tracked down and destroyed. The sooner the better. \u201cShe must have planned her escape from Valhalla for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep cleaning up her kills, Niko.\u201d Arel grimaced. \u201cThere have been five more. Plus the losses we suffered\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how many she\u2019s killed,\u201d Niko interrupted. He couldn\u2019t discuss Fiona\u2019s bloody murder.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll understand that I was sent by the Tagos to warn you that you have until the end of the month,\u201d Arel said, referring to the ultimate leader of the Sentinels. \u201cAfter that he wants you on the trail in Texas.\u201d</p><p>Niko shrugged, unperturbed by the warning. \u201cDylan will be here before then.\u201d</p><p>Arel snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re good, but you\u2019re no psychic. How can you be so certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring break starts at the end of classes tomorrow,\u201d he said, his gaze narrowing as he watched Angela being led to the edge of the dance floor by a blond jackass who obviously ate steroids like candy. No mere mortal had those kinds of muscles without pharmaceutical help. He didn\u2019t like the way the bastard was staring at her overexposed breasts. In fact, he might very well find a way to make Blondie disappear if he laid a hand on the vulnerable female. \u201cIt will be the perfect opportunity to make Angela Thorne disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for her to try and be subtle, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Arel demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to attract attention to draw us south. Now she\u2019ll want to fly below the radar. She won\u2019t want us knowing that she has the scientist,\u201d he pointed out, his tone absent as his attention remained homed in on the female who was moving with a surprising grace. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s far more difficult to disappear when you have a hostage.\u201d</p><p>Easily sensing Niko\u2019s distraction, Arel leaned against the railing.</p><p>\u201cIs she the real deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s the real deal.\u201d Niko forced himself to shift his attention back to his companion. Until Dylan was dead he couldn\u2019t afford to be distracted. Especially not by this particular female. \u201cCalder intended to bring her to the compound after she graduated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted the female to enjoy being normal for as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Arel gave a grunt of laughter. \u201cHe\u2019s always been too softhearted for his own good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get an argument from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re a coldhearted Sentinel who\u2019s willing to use an innocent female as bait for a psycho killer.\u201d</p><p>Arel\u2019s words rasped a raw nerve that Niko didn\u2019t even know he possessed until he\u2019d crossed paths with the pretty young scientist who\u2019d slayed him with one shy smile.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Angela Locke was a pawn.</p><p>And like any pawn she was supposed to be expendable.</p><p>So why had he spent the past six weeks imagining her stretched beneath him as he taught her the true meaning of biology?</p><p>He swallowed a low growl. \u201cI get results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough . . .\u201d Arel\u2019s words ended with a low whistle as the frantic music ended and Angela turned to reveal her slender curves so shockingly revealed by those too-tight jeans and the shirt that should be illegal. Damn, Megan. It had to be her influence. \u201cHellooo. You didn\u2019t say anything about her being a beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it has nothing to do with the job,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Arel smiled with a slow anticipation. \u201cHey, if you don\u2019t want to bed her, I will.\u201d</p><p>Niko hissed at his unexpected surge of fury. He was never possessive of women. Not even when they were his lovers.</p><p>It had to be this job.</p><p>He was . . . on edge. Anxious to find Dylan and make her pay for what she\u2019d done to Fiona.</p><p>That had to be it.</p><p>Feeling the weight of Arel\u2019s all-too-knowing gaze, he sent his fellow Sentinel a scowl.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have someplace you have to be?\u201d</p><p>A mysterious smile played around the younger man\u2019s lips. \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t mind changing assignments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Arel.\u201d</p><p>Arel chuckled before he placed a hand on Niko\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake care. I\u2019ve already lost two friends. I won\u2019t lose another.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Usually the small apartment three blocks away from the campus was a place of peace for Angela.</p><p>Not that anyone else would share her opinion.</p><p>Most people would shudder at the worn furniture that she\u2019d picked up at second-hand stores and garage sales. Not to mention the bedroom that was overflowing with unpacked boxes from her mother\u2019s house. Boxes that were filled with painful memories she wasn\u2019t prepared to open.</p><p>And oh yeah, a kitchen that had become a mini-lab with microscopes, petri dishes, test tubes, and three small fridges that contained her current experiments.</p><p>Hardly the palace most women dreamed of.</p><p>But for Angela it was far better than a palace.</p><p>It was her safe haven.</p><p>The moment she closed the door she could forget the day, along with the frustrating challenge of trying to fit in a world that always seemed slightly out of focus.</p><p>Today, however, there was no peace as she shut and locked the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pacing across the living room, she peeked through the curtains at the empty street below.</p><p>It had started this morning.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the entire day with the sensation she was being watched by some unseen lurker.</p> <p>And she laid full blame on the shoulders of Dr. Nikolo Bartrev.</p><p>Not because of his abrupt arrival and equally abrupt departure from the club last night, although the aggravating man had taken away any hope of enjoying the night. Oh, she\u2019d gone through the routine for Megan\u2019s sake. She\u2019d danced, she\u2019d sipped her gin fizz, and laughed on cue, but the evening had gone flat.</p><p>No, she was used to wishing for things she could never have.</p><p>It was his warning of a mysterious stalker that had her jumping at shadows.</p><p>Seeing nothing but the usual joggers and occasional car drive past, she gave a shake of her head.</p> <p>What had she expected?</p><p>A stranger wearing a hockey mask and lurking on the sidewalk?</p><p>Or maybe a car in the parking lot with a sign that said STALKERS \u201cR\u201d US?</p><p>\u201cThis is stupid,\u201d she muttered, stepping away from the window and heading into the kitchen.</p><p>Spring break had officially started. Classes were out, the majority of the students were even now fleeing town for warmer climes, and she would have a blessed, uninterrupted week to work on her private research.</p><p>No doubt Megan would toss her hands up in defeat, but as far as Angela was concerned she\u2019d rather be concentrating on her work than wasting her days on an overcrowded beach.</p> <p>Okay, maybe if the beach included Professor Hottie she might consider\u2014</p><p>Entering the kitchen, Angela came to a halt, a strange sense of alarm tingling down her spine.</p><p>Someone had been in here.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know exactly how she could be so certain. Perhaps the microscope had been shifted ever so slightly. Or maybe there was a lingering scent she didn\u2019t quite recognize.</p><p>Whatever the cause, her vague unease became full on, adrenaline-charging alarm as she whirled around, intent on fleeing the apartment.</p><p>A wise decision that came too late.</p><p>She barely managed a step before the door was blocked by a slender figure.</p><p>Angela\u2019s heart slammed to a halt as she took a swift inventory of the intruder.</p> <p>The stranger wasn\u2019t much taller than her, and was dressed from head to toe in black. Black leather pants. Black turtleneck sweater. Black ski mask.</p><p>Good grief. Did stalkers have a uniform code?</p><p>She swallowed a hysterical urge to laugh, sternly reminding herself that she was in danger.</p><p>Despite the fact the intruder was more or less the same size as herself and clearly female, she wasn\u2019t fooled. Beneath the tight clothes she could make out hard, lean muscles that warned the intruder could tie Angela into a painful pretzel.</p><p>Or worse.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she managed to croak, her mind sluggishly trying to shift through her limited options.</p><p>No. Not limited.</p><p>Nonexistent.</p><p>Her cell phone was in her purse that she\u2019d left in the living room. There was no doubt a knife was tucked in her silverware drawer, but it was across the room. And there was nothing close enough at hand to use as a weapon.</p><p>For now her options were talking her way out of danger or hoping for a miracle.</p><p>Neither seemed likely.</p><p>Casually leaning a shoulder against the doorjamb the intruder revealed she was in far better control of her nerves than Angela.</p><p>\u201cWould you believe a friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A nonchalant shrug. \u201cThen let\u2019s say I\u2019m a potential customer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCustomer?\u201d Angela frowned before she gave a small gasp of understanding. \u201cOh. I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>The woman adjusted her black glove. Preparing for violence?</p><p>\u201cI rarely make mistakes,\u201d she drawled. Her voice was oddly beautiful. Almost hypnotic.</p><p>Angela licked her lips, flicking a brief glance toward the expensive equipment that was piled on the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cI know it must look like I manufacture drugs, but I\u2019m just a scientist,\u201d she said, her palms damp. Had the temperature gone up? Or was it sheer terror that was making her feel as if her sweatshirt and jeans were smothering her? \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that will get you high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a scientist?\u201d The stranger gave a chiding shake of her head. \u201cNow, now, Angela. There\u2019s no need for such modesty. You\u2019re already considered the brilliant star in the world of genetics.\u201d</p><p>Angela took a shocked step back. \u201cYou know me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been following your career with breathless anticipation.\u201d</p><p>Okay. The whole encounter had just shifted from scary to terrifyingly creepy.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she repeated the question that had never been answered.</p><p>The intruder straightened, taking a step into the kitchen. \u201cA devoted fan.\u201d</p><p>Fan? Did scientists have groupies?</p><p>Well, beyond Stephen Hawking?</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, but I\u2019m just a postgraduate student struggling to finish her dissertation,\u201d she said, her voice quivering. \u201cIf you want to speak with an actual researcher\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you I want,\u201d the woman interrupted.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA job.\u201d</p><p>The simple words caught Angela off guard.</p><p>Was that why this woman had snuck into her home?</p><p>She\u2019d been warned that recruiters could be aggressive when trying to capture the top graduates. Especially recruiters from pharmaceutical companies. But this was beyond ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cActually, I haven\u2019t really considered what I plan to do after graduation, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s something of a rush job.\u201d</p><p>With a lift of her hand the stranger yanked off her stocking hat and Angela nearly went to her knees in shock.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d she muttered, trying to make sense of what she was seeing.</p><p>The . . . woman (yeah, she was still convinced the intruder was female despite the fact she was completely bald) had eyes that were as red as rubies and a nose that was oddly flat. Like a snake. And worse, her visible skin was patterned with large, dark spots that went way beyond freckles.</p><p>The intruder smiled. Not a pleasant smile. More a stretching of her thin lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn this way?\u201d The woman pulled off her gloves, revealing her hands that were spotted like her face and tipped with claws. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Angela tried to clear the mammoth-sized lump from her throat.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreak.\u201d</p><p>Everyone knew of high-bloods, or freaks, as most people called them. The special people born with some sort of mutation that made them different from others.</p><p>Not that the general population truly knew much about them. There were rumors of witches and psychics and necromancers. And the strange Sentinels. Then there were the whispers that there were true monsters being hidden behind the walls of Valhalla.</p><p>As a future geneticist, Angela devoured the bits and pieces of information on the high-bloods. Unfortunately the Mave who ruled the residents of Valhalla and the satellite communities refused to allow her people to be studied. Only scientists who were a part of their community were allowed any research. Even local doctors were forced to contact Valhalla if a freak turned up in the ER. And anyone trying to collect genetic material was subject to punishment by the Mave.</p><p>Not something anyone would be willing to risk.</p><p>Now, however, she realized that her clinical fascination with high-blood DNA hadn\u2019t taken into account the brutal truth of what it meant to be . . . different.</p><p>The personal cost was written in the bitter glow of the crimson eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Angela whispered before she could halt the impulsive words.</p><p>The female snorted. \u201cNot nearly as sorry as I am.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Angela got that.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple. I want you to fix me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFix you?\u201d Angela parroted, her brilliant brain trained to comprehend logical facts, not . . . this. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a fucking doctor could cure me?\u201d</p><p>Angela took another step backward, her ass hitting the edge of the sink.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour gift is to alter DNA.\u201d The woman pulled off her other glove and tossed it on the ground. Then she ran her fingers over her bald head. \u201cI want you to make me normal.\u201d</p><p>Through her fog of fear, Angela felt a stab of sympathy. She understood the woman\u2019s desperation. She truly did.</p><p>But, sympathizing with the stranger didn\u2019t mean she could help her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes narrowed. \u201cNothing in this world is impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but the technology isn\u2019t anywhere near advanced enough. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnology?\u201d Something that might have been amusement rippled over the strange, exotic face. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about test tubes and microscopes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>The woman waved a hand toward the kitchen table. \u201cWhy do you bother with this junk anyway?\u201d</p><p>Was this some sort of trick?</p> <p>\u201cI need it for my research,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cAlthough I admit it can\u2019t compare to my lab at the university.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Angela,\u201d the intruder scoffed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide the truth from me.\u201d</p><p>Angela went rigid with a strange sense of wariness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>The woman gave a sharp laugh. \u201cYou haven\u2019t figured it out yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFigured out what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Angela Locke, are a freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Angela shook her head, squashing the ridiculous urge to slap her hands over her ears. The woman was nuts. A full-blown wackadoodle. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think you\u2019re able to manipulate cells that no one else can?\u201d</p><p>Angela sucked in a ragged breath. Why wasn\u2019t she laughing at the woman\u2019s outrageous claims?</p><p>\u201cThe magnetic particles I\u2019ve developed\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d The woman stepped close enough for Angela to feel the heat she radiated from her skin even through her clothes. Obviously her mutation made her run at a higher temperature. \u201cIt\u2019s you. It\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy.\u201d Angela was trapped, reaching behind her to grasp the edge of the counter. Her knees were threatening to collapse. \u201cI want you out of my apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d The creepy smile returned as the woman reached out with terrifying speed to lock her hands around Angela\u2019s upper arms, her claws digging through the sweatshirt to puncture the tender skin beneath. \u201cI was going to let you pack a bag, but whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Angela cried, fear and pain hammering through her with equal force. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes glowed with an eerie light. \u201cI have a comfy little home all prepared for our arrival. You\u2019re not leaving my side until you fix me.\u201d</p><p>Her grip tightened, but even as Angela braced herself to be dragged from the room kicking and screaming, the stranger was tilting back her head to sniff the air. Like an animal.</p><p>Angela shuddered. Oh . . . God. What now?</p><p>In answer, the woman whirled toward the door, her hands clenched in tight fists.</p> <p>\u201cNiko,\u201d she hissed, not nearly as dumbfounded as Angela as a tall, stunningly familiar man stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cDylan,\u201d Dr. Nikolo Bartrev drawled, his handsome face carved from granite. \u201cI knew you\u2019d eventually show up here.\u201d</p><p>It was rare for Nikolo to be caught flat-footed.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t rare.</p><p>It was never.</p><p>But trailing Angela from the university to her apartment building, he\u2019d taken time to make a sweep of the neighborhood. He was certain Dylan was going to make her move. And make it soon.</p><p>He just hadn\u2019t expected her to already be in the apartment.</p><p>A mistake that might have cost Angela her life.</p><p>The realization detonated a strange explosion of fear and fury in the depths of his soul.</p><p>A sensation that was as unfamiliar as it was unexpected.</p><p>Niko was trained to hone his feelings into a smooth blade of cold, calculating resolve. Becoming emotional only clouded his mind and dulled his instincts.</p><p>But silently entering the apartment, he hadn\u2019t been worried about his prey. Or even his own life.</p><p>His sole focus was reaching Angela before she could be hurt.</p><p>Stepping into the kitchen he came to an abrupt halt at the sight of Dylan standing directly in front of Angela. Shit. She was too close to risk an attack.</p><p>One swing of her hand and she could crush Angela\u2019s skull. Or use her claws to rip out her throat.</p><p>He swallowed a growl, ignoring the voice that warned his hesitation might cost him the opportunity to put an end to Dylan\u2019s murderous rampage.</p><p>He would have his revenge, he grimly assured himself. But not at Angela\u2019s expense.</p><p>Wiping all expression from his face, he watched Dylan slowly turn, her crimson eyes filled with a mocking amusement that didn\u2019t entirely disguise her seething frustration.</p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d she drawled. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a fucking hole in the head,\u201d he retorted, allowing only a brief glance toward Angela who was studying him with a shocked gaze. \u201cYou gave up any claim to loyalty when you killed Adam and Fiona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t believe me, but I wish their deaths hadn\u2019t been necessary.\u201d</p><p>Niko shrugged aside the female\u2019s genuine regret. He\u2019d been the one to discover the two Sentinels. Adam had lost his throat when he\u2019d obviously gone into Dylan\u2019s room to check on her, while Fiona had been shot in the back of her head while standing guard at the entrance to the psych ward.</p><p>Adam had been a longtime friend, while Fiona had been as close as any daughter to him.</p><p>He would mourn their deaths for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cIt was a choice, not a necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d Dylan countered. \u201cYou weren\u2019t chained to the walls like an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your own safety.\u201d Niko made a sound of disgust. \u201cOf course, that was a ruse, wasn\u2019t it? You never intended to kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>The female shrugged. \u201cI needed to distract attention. I knew I was being watched.\u201d</p><p>Niko narrowed his eyes. It had been one of the clairvoyants who\u2019d picked up on Dylan\u2019s growingly dark thoughts, although the Sentinel had the ability to hide her secret plans. It was enough to put a constant surveillance on the unstable female.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a psychopath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo easy for you to judge when you walk around like a Greek god,\u201d Dylan hissed. \u201cHow would you feel if you looked like a monster?\u201d</p><p>He deliberately allowed his gaze to roam over the spotted skin and too-flat nose before returning to meet the smoldering crimson glare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been a monster to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily?\u201d Her sharp laugh sliced through the air. \u201cMy family tossed me away at birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were your family,\u201d he reminded her. All high-bloods were welcomed at Valhalla and Dylan had been raised by people who loved her. \u201cYour parents gave you to us because they understood the challenges you would face and trusted us to protect you.\u201d</p><p>She gave a restless shake of her head, her madness refusing to acknowledge she\u2019d been treated with nothing but kindness.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy trail was in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t escape to kill humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew I was coming for the scientist,\u201d she murmured, glancing over her shoulder at the white-faced Angela before turning back to Niko with a sudden realization. \u201cAh, you used her as bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There was a raw, pained sound from Angela that pierced Niko\u2019s heart. Christ. That was a little tidbit he\u2019d intended to keep to himself.</p><p>But even as he ground his teeth at the thought of Angela\u2019s sense of betrayal, his gaze never strayed from Dylan.</p><p>The bitch was still too close to Angela for him to strike.</p><p>\u201cAlways so clever, Niko,\u201d the Sentinel mocked.</p><p>Clever. Yeah, not clever enough to avoid his own trap, he acknowledged wryly, belatedly accepting that Dylan wasn\u2019t the only one to have fallen for the bait.</p><p>He took a step forward. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, this isn\u2019t the end. The game is just beginning.\u201d With the fluid speed of all Sentinels, Dylan turned to Angela, her hand shooting out to grasp her chin with claws that bit into the tender skin. \u201cI\u2019ll come for you later, sweet Angela. Niko can\u2019t guard you forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Niko launched himself forward, but as fast as he was, Dylan was already leaping through the window over the sink and dropping the two stories to the parking lot below.</p><p>Without hesitation Niko was in pursuit.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>On some level Angela knew she must be in shock.</p><p>Otherwise she\u2019d be curled in the middle of the floor screaming in terror. Or at the very least, calling nine-one-one.</p><p>Instead she stumbled toward her bedroom, barely aware of what she was doing as she found a gym bag on the floor of her closet and began stuffing it with clothes.</p><p>She had to get away.</p><p>Somewhere.</p><p>Anywhere.</p><p>The destination didn\u2019t matter. Just so long as it wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Vaguely realizing the bag was full, she zipped it shut and rose to her feet.</p><p>It was only when she turned that she realized she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She dropped the bag, reaching behind her back to retrieve the carving knife she\u2019d grabbed on her way out of the kitchen. \u201cStay back.\u201d</p><p>In answer Niko took a deliberate step forward, his gaze flicking down to the bag at her feet.</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ve packed.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze locked on the handsome face that had filled her dreams for six long weeks. God. He looked so . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abruptly her tight knot of fear exploded into sheer rage. \u201cI told you to stay back,\u201d she snarled, waving the knife in warning.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Angela.\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cYou need to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed with a crippling sense of betrayal. It didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d known this man for less than two months. Or that he\u2019d never made her any promises.</p> <p>She\u2019d felt a . . . connection to him.</p><p>A tenuous hope that he would be the one man to eventually see the woman beneath the awkward nerd.</p><p>God. Could she have been more delusional?</p><p>\u201cSo I can hear more lies, Dr. Bartrev?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, as if bothered by the harsh edge of accusation in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cMy name isn\u2019t a lie,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Nikolo Bartrev.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took another step forward and Angela shivered as he dropped his pretense of a harmless professor. It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d snapped his fingers and transformed into another creature. It was more a subtle hardening of his dark, beautiful features. The squaring of his broad shoulders that looked even broader beneath the cream cable sweater. And the swirl of heat that poured through the room, stroking over her in silent warning. \u201cI\u2019m a Sentinel.\u201d</p><p>She tossed aside the knife. It was worse than useless considering she was more likely to poke it into herself than harm the dangerous predator that watched her with his piercing blue gaze.</p><p>And he was a predator.</p><p>She could sense it with every fiber of her being.</p> <p>\u201cI thought Sentinels were marked with tattoos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose who act as guardians are protected by wards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a hunter. I need to . . . blend when necessary.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw clenched at the painful reminder of his charade.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cSo what makes you a Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, clearly considering his words. Did the high-bloods have a code of silence? She wouldn\u2019t doubt it. There was very little information about them in the general population.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m stronger and faster than most people,\u201d he at last admitted. \u201cI also have heightened senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s your job to track down freaks.\u201d She deliberately used the insult.</p><p>Beneath her overriding fear she was well and truly pissed.</p><p>Who could blame her?</p><p>Her chin was bleeding from the claws used by the creepy Dylan who intended to kidnap her and force her to play the role of Dr. Frankenstein. And this man\u2014this arrogant jackass\u2014had treated her like she was nothing more than an expendable object.</p><p>Something to be used and tossed away.</p><p>He gave a dip of his head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always get your man?\u201d</p><p>His gaze briefly lowered to the soft curve of her breasts barely visible beneath her sweatshirt.</p><p>\u201cOr woman.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples tightened in instant reaction and she swallowed a curse. The tingling, heart-stopping heat that she\u2019d always savored when near this man was now a brutal reminder of just how humiliatingly na\u00efve she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cNo matter who you have to use?\u201d</p><p>He shoved impatient fingers through the short strands of his hair.</p><p>\u201cDylan killed two Sentinels to escape Valhalla, then twelve norms to try and draw us from her true purpose,\u201d he rasped. \u201cShe has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Angela grimaced. Fourteen people murdered? Okay. Obviously the psycho killer had to be captured.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make it any easier to know she\u2019d been used as bait.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know she would be coming here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who has the talent to alter her appearance.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head before he finished speaking.</p><p>Dammit. Why were they trying to make her believe she was a freak?</p><p>Did they think it would make her more sympathetic to their cause?</p><p>\u201cNot. In. The. Mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Perhaps sensing she was on the verge of a meltdown, he wisely backed off. \u201cWe need to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d She made a sound of disbelief. \u201cAre you brain-dead? I\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his jaw twitched, but he grimly held on to his temper.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice. Dylan\u2019s not going to stop hunting you. Not until she\u2019s dead.\u201d He deliberately paused. \u201cOr you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was gripping her upper arms firmly before she even realized he\u2019d moved. Holy shit. He wasn\u2019t lying when he said he was faster. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She tilted back her head, pretending his touch wasn\u2019t searing through her sweatshirt.</p><p>The lover of my dreams is now my enemy, she fiercely reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together in a scowl. \u201cDammit, Angela, I\u2019m only trying to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little late for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate for what?\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to meet his ruthless gaze. \u201cIf you truly wanted to protect me you\u2019d have told me the truth from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she mocked, not bothering to try and pull from his grasp. What was the point? He was clearly ten times stronger than her. Which should have made her wonder why she was pissed instead of terrified. \u201cI\u2019m just the bait, right?\u201d</p><p>He heaved a harsh sigh. \u201cI was never going to let you be hurt.\u201d</p><p>Was he kidding?</p><p>She shook her head in disgust. \u201cWell you did.\u201d</p><p>He hissed, his hands skimming down to her wrists so he could tug her arms up as his gaze inspected her slender body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the scratches on your face. Are you wounded anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her wrist free and, balling her hand into a fist, she slugged him in the center of his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt me, you bastard,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He tensed at her accusation. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Ignoring all sanity, she hit him again. \u201cThen why did you pretend to be my friend?\u201d</p><p>His beautiful face became wary. \u201cI needed to be close to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You\u2019re some magical Sentinel, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou could have watched without me ever knowing you were around. Instead you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered at the aching sense of betrayal. She was used to being teased, or more often, ignored by the opposite sex. But she\u2019d never been so callously humiliated.</p><p>\u201cYou let me think you liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her waist. Hitting him only hurt her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he commanded, studying her with a brooding intensity. \u201cYou\u2019re the most brilliant person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d She gave a humorless laugh. \u201cThen why did I spend my nights fantasizing about a man who was willing to offer me up as a sacrifice to a psychopath?\u201d</p><p>Something dark and dangerous flared to life in his eyes. Something he\u2019d never allowed her to see before.</p><p>But, even as Angela took an instinctive step backward, Niko was reaching to yank her against his unyielding chest.</p><p>Danger. Heat. Desire.</p><p>She squawked in surprise, her mouth opening to protest his manhandling.</p><p>And he kissed her.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>His lips were hard, hungry, just as she\u2019d always fantasized, but the brush of his tongue was a gentle caress. He pressed her closer and the feel of his thickening arousal sent a stab of excitement to the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She moaned, her hands lifting to his shoulders as fiery heat flowed like lava through her, searing away the world where she was being hunted by a mass murderer and this man was her enemy.</p><p>Somewhere in his lust-hazed mind, Niko knew he was behaving badly.</p><p>Even for a man who rarely bothered himself with tedious things like good manners or proper behavior, he understood you didn\u2019t grab a woman who was furious with you and kiss her like a Neanderthal.</p><p>But he\u2019d spent six long weeks denying his rampant desire for this female, pretending that she was just a pawn in his game while he used every excuse to spend time in her company.</p><p>Now shockwaves of pleasure jolted through him, making it all blindingly clear.</p><p>This woman wasn\u2019t a pawn.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t bait.</p><p>She was . . . his.</p><p>His hands trailed up the delicate line of her back, his cock already hard and aching for release. He groaned, his tongue dipping between her lips to taste the warm, sweet woman who\u2019d plagued his dreams.</p><p>She shivered, but his hunter instincts were easily able to sense it wasn\u2019t with fear.</p><p>He could hear the rapid beat of her heart, feel the rush of blood beneath her satin skin and catch the scent of her stirring arousal.</p><p>She was angry with him, but that didn\u2019t halt her response to his touch.</p><p>His hand swept beneath the thick curtain of her hair, cupping her nape as he deepened the kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted to toss her on the bed just inches away and devour every satin inch of her. Over and over.</p><p>Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon.</p><p>Not only was Dylan still on the loose, but he suspected that Angela was far more innocent than most females her age.</p> <p>When he finally had her in his bed he wanted all night to demonstrate why she should remain there.</p><p>Reluctantly lifting his head, he gazed down at her upturned face. Over the past weeks he\u2019d memorized every line and curve of her delicate features. Not because of his Sentinel training, but because he\u2019d been fascinated by her quiet beauty. The velvet darkness of her eyes and the lush curve of her mouth.</p><p>He\u2019d even learned to recognize the play of emotion over her expressive features.</p><p>He knew when she furrowed her brow she was lost in her clever thoughts. And when she chewed her bottom lip she was feeling awkward in a conversation. And when her eyes grew dreamy she was thinking of him.</p><p>He stroked a finger over the soft color staining her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a shaky breath, her wide eyes dazed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His finger moved to outline her lips. How long had he\u2019d wondered what they would taste like? It seemed an eternity.</p><p>Now he knew.</p><p>Cherries.</p><p>Fresh cherries still warm from the sunshine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I wanted to do from the minute I caught sight of you.\u201d</p><p>She briefly allowed herself to become lost in his gaze, revealing far more of her vulnerable need than she realized. Then, obviously remembering why he was in her bedroom, oh, and the fact she currently hated him, she gave a sharp shake of her head.</p><p>\u201cLiar. This is some new trick to try and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again.</p><p>Okay, maybe he was a Neanderthal. At least where Angela Locke was concerned.</p><p>He wanted to brand her. With his touch, his kiss, his passion . . .</p><p>He swallowed her choked groan, his hands shifting to tenderly cup her face. Slowly he savored the taste of cherries and delectable woman, his thumbs stroking over the fluttering pulse just below her jaw.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until she was arching toward him in silent need that he lifted his head to meet her unfocused gaze.</p> <p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have watched you from the shadows.\u201d</p><p>Another blink. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He peered deep into her wide eyes. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiko\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to leave,\u201d he interrupted, forcing himself to drop his hands.</p><p>He\u2019d been a Sentinel for a very, very long time. And never had he lost sight of his goal.</p><p>But with this woman . . . dammit.</p><p>He was in real danger of allowing himself to be distracted.</p><p>Which was a perfect way to get them both killed.</p><p>She frowned, struggling to follow his words. \u201cLeave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan hasn\u2019t given up her obsession of becoming normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pushed back her hair with an unsteady hand. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is she so anxious to become normal? There\u2019s a lot of people like you, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike us,\u201d he corrected, knowing at some point she was going to have to accept that she was special. \u201cAnd yes, there are high-bloods all over the world. But most are able to pass as common norms with a little effort.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his reminder she wasn\u2019t one of the norms. Typical. In the past six weeks he\u2019d realized that Angela was capable of ignoring any number of things. Including her less than \u201cnormal\u201d ability to manipulate cells.</p><p>\u201cIs her physical appearance all that\u2019s different about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He held her gaze. \u201cShe\u2019s a Sentinel. Like me.\u201d</p><p>Her expression hardened at the reminder of his position. She might melt at his touch, but she wasn\u2019t going to forgive anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cA better Sentinel than you?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cNo, not better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you catch her?\u201d</p><p>A hell of a question.</p><p>When he\u2019d followed Dylan through the window he\u2019d fully intended to hunt her down and put an end to her bloody rampage. A fine plan, but Dylan wasn\u2019t without her own skills and she managed to disguise her trail only a few blocks away.</p><p>Given time, Niko could have unraveled the various ruses that she\u2019d used to hide her presence. He hadn\u2019t been boasting when he assured Angela that he was the better Sentinel.</p><p>But even as his duty demanded he carry on his hunt no matter how long it took, the man in him was urging him back to Angela\u2019s apartment.</p><p>He\u2019d told himself that it only made sense. Dylan wasn\u2019t going to leave without Angela. She was convinced the young scientist was her one hope of living a normal life. But in the depths of his heart he knew that wasn\u2019t the reason he\u2019d rushed back to the apartment.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be sure that she wouldn\u2019t circle back,\u201d he admitted with a reluctant honesty.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were concerned for my safety?\u201d She rolled her eyes, not able to hide her lingering sense of betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d royally screwed up. Fine, he got it. But now wasn\u2019t the time to soothe ruffled feathers. He could defeat Dylan in a fair battle, but the Sentinel was no longer playing by the rules. Who knew what nasty surprises she might have up her sleeve? Hell, he didn\u2019t even know for sure that she was working alone. He needed to get Angela somewhere safe.</p><p>With a grimace at the knowledge he was about to give this woman yet another reason to be pissed off, he grabbed her around the waist and with one smooth motion had her tossed over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she cried out, swinging her legs in an effort to hit the part of him that was as vulnerable as any man\u2019s. \u201cPut me down, you . . . you bully.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping an arm around her knees, he locked her into place before reaching down to grab her bag from the floor.</p><p>Who knew that rescuing a damsel in distress could be such a pain in the ass?</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Angela stewed in silence as Niko headed his battered Jeep north, swiftly taking them away from the outskirts of Columbia to the farmlands that surrounded the town.</p><p>It was always a beautiful drive. The manicured fields dissected by meandering streams. The sturdy farmhouses that were dwarfed by red-painted barns, along with sheds and paddocks.</p><p>Today it was even more charming with the fading April sunlight offering a hint of spring and the tiny buds beginning to appear on the trees and bushes.</p><p>Unfortunately, she was too busy glaring at the stark male profile of Nikolo Bartrev to pay attention to the passing scenery.</p><p>He really was indecently handsome, she was forced to acknowledge, even as she considered the pleasure of punching hard enough to break his perfect nose.</p><p>He\u2019d lied to her, used her, and now kidnapped her.</p><p>Okay, to be completely fair, he\u2019d rescued her from the whacked-out freak. And she wasn\u2019t entirely averse to having him near in case Dylan made a repeat appearance. At least until she could find someplace to hide.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t still mad as hell.</p><p>Or that she wasn\u2019t going to try to escape the very second she suspected he was about to serve her up to the wolves. Or in this case\u2014the freaks.</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust him any farther than she could throw him.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t very damned far.</p><p>Her dark thoughts were interrupted as the Jeep slowed and Niko halted in front of a heavy gate that blocked the narrow gravel road. Slipping out of the vehicle, he moved to punch a series of numbers onto a computer screen that was set in a small gatehouse before returning to steer the Jeep through the open gates and down the road that was lined with massive oak trees.</p><p>She frowned, abruptly conscious of just how isolated they were as he turned yet again and stopped in front of a picturesque log cabin that was nestled among the trees.</p><p>The front of the A-frame house was made entirely of glass, giving a hint of the large living room with a silver sectional couch loaded with bright pillows and a spiral staircase in the middle of the planked floor leading to the open loft above.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>He put the Jeep in park and pocketed the keys. She grimaced, belatedly wishing she\u2019d learned how to hot-wire a car.</p><p>Who knew it would come in handy?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been staying here since traveling to Missouri.\u201d</p><p>She blinked in surprise, her gaze returning to the house that managed to be elegant despite its rustic style.</p><p>It looked so . . . normal.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>He shoved open the door to the vehicle and stepped out. \u201cDid you think I crawled beneath a rock every night?\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, she climbed out to join him on the pathway leading to the wide, wooden terrace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where most slimy invertebrates slither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlimy?\u201d His lips tugged into a lopsided grin. \u201cIs that a scientific term?\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a treacherous beat. It was no wonder he so rarely smiled. It was lethal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPersonal opinion,\u201d she managed to mutter.</p><p>Grasping her elbow, he led her onto the terrace.

There was a small beep before the door slid open.</p><p>Good grief.</p> <p>This place had the sort of security she\u2019d only seen in movies.</p><p>Perhaps sensing her confusion, he sent her a wry smile as he urged her over the threshold and into the house.</p><p>\u201cI borrowed the cabin from a friend,\u201d he said, closing the door and pressing a button that reset the lock.</p><p>He pressed another button that did something to darken the windows. She assumed it was so they could see out, but no one could see in.</p><p>\u201cA Sentinel?\u201d she guessed.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Serra is a psychic.\u201d</p><p>In spite of the combustible combination of fear and anger that continued to seethe through her rigid body, Angela felt an undeniable stab of curiosity.</p><p>Hardly a big shocker.</p><p>She was a scientist who\u2019d been obsessed with genetics for as long as she could remember.</p><p>\u201cI thought most high-bloods lived together?\u201d</p><p>He turned to meet her searching gaze. \u201cMost prefer the comfort, not to mention the safety, of official compounds, but psychics have a need to seek solitude on occasion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She glanced toward the windows that offered a view of the thick woods that encircled the house. The nearest neighbor was no doubt miles away. \u201cI never thought how annoying it must be to hear other people\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis house belonged to Serra\u2019s parents before they retired to Florida.\u201d His features softened as he spoke of the psychic. \u201cShe was fortunate to have parents who remained an important part of her life. They chose this spot to give her a place of peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she your lover?\u201d</p><p>The words left Angela\u2019s lips before she could call them back and her face flushed with heat as he stepped toward her with a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one female I want in my bed.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous excitement spiraled through her at his low, husky voice, stealing her breath and making her knees weak.</p><p>If only that were true.</p><p>If only this intelligent, powerful, drop-dead-gorgeous man had truly been a visiting professor who\u2019d been intrigued by me, the shy young scientist.</p> <p>Yeah, and if only pigs could fly.</p><p>She tilted her chin, trying to pretend as if she couldn\u2019t feel the heat of his hard, muscular, perfectly chiseled body searing through her clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, as if he was frustrated by her refusal to accept that his desire could be genuine.</p><p>\u201cThe house has a sophisticated alarm system including hidden surveillance. It\u2019s also less than an hour from a monastery.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known that the monasteries had a close connection to Valhalla. Not only training the mysterious Sentinels who served as guardians to the high-bloods when they traveled among the regular population, but also offering asylum for any high-blood who felt in danger.</p><p>No one was allowed in the monastery without invitation from the monks.</p><p>Not the cops, or military, or even the leaders of the country where the monastery was located.</p><p>They had the mystical powers to remain impervious to politics.</p><p>\u201cYou have business with the monks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing teleportation will be the fastest way to reach Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>She took a hasty step backward. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be scared.\u201d</p><p>He studied her as if surprised she would be afraid of being magically transported from one place to another. As he should be. Under normal circumstances she would have been thrilled out of her mind at the opportunity to not only see inside a mysterious monastery, but to travel from portal to portal. It would be . . . amazing. But these weren\u2019t normal circumstances and she wasn\u2019t going to allow herself to be trapped in a place that she couldn\u2019t be sure she could escape from.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cDespite all the entertaining tales of people disappearing into outer space or arriving at the destination half-man/half-fish I can promise you that it\u2019s perfectly safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant that I\u2019m not going to Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together at her stubborn tone. \u201cAngela, it\u2019s the one place Dylan can\u2019t reach you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? It didn\u2019t sound that way to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou accused Dylan of killing two Sentinels before managing to escape from this supposedly \u2018safe haven\u2019,\u201d she reminded him, shivering at the memory of the strange female. It wasn\u2019t remotely difficult to accept she\u2019d murdered her friends. Dylan was clearly unstable. \u201cNow you want to plant me there like a sitting duck?\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cOr is that the point? Am I still the bait?\u201d</p><p>His breath hissed between his teeth, his hand lifting to rake impatient fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cIf you were the bait, I would have left you at the apartment and waited for Dylan to return,\u201d he rasped. \u201cBecause I can assure you that she would have come for you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was true.</p><p>Even if she wasn\u2019t in the mood to admit it.</p><p>Instead her chin tilted another inch. \u201cYou can\u2019t force me to go to Valhalla.\u201d</p><p>The blue eyes darkened with a hint of the predator that waited just below the surface.</p><p>Sentinel.</p><p>She\u2019d glimpsed the danger that lurked beneath his pretense of civilization. A damned shame she hadn\u2019t paid attention to her instincts.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve already proven I can make you go wherever I want,\u201d he reminded her in deceptively soft tones.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin, his touch unexpectedly gentle. \u201cBut, I would rather you go willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. Gonna. Happen,\u201d she snapped, hoping he didn\u2019t feel her shiver as the heat of his fingers warmed her to the tip of her toes.</p><p>And lots of interesting places in between.</p><p>His eyes darkened, but this time it was with a stark hunger that made her heart pound.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say pretty please?\u201d he asked in a low, compelling voice, his thumb brushing over her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>His hooded gaze studied her upturned face, something perilously close to possession in his dark expression.</p><p>\u201cAh, if only it was so simple.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry as her body instinctively arched toward his solid strength. Dang it. She\u2019d lusted after him for so long. Weaving impossible fantasies in her head.</p><p>Now her body didn\u2019t seem to understand that she wasn\u2019t supposed to be melting beneath his touch.</p><p>Traitorous hormones.</p><p>\u201cNiko.\u201d His name came as a breathy whisper instead of the protest she intended.</p><p>He muttered a low curse as his head lowered so he could brush his mouth along the sensitive curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI like hearing my name on your lips.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to clutch at the cashmere softness of his sweater as he nuzzled a path upward. Oh . . . crap. It felt soooo good.</p><p>The sort of good that made smart women do stupid things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad at you,\u201d she managed to mutter.</p><p>He found the pulse that thundered just below her jaw, stroking it with the rough rasp of his tongue before giving it a tiny nip.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Angela gasped at the primitive stab of pleasure that arrowed through her.</p><p>Her limited experience with the opposite sex included a few fumbled kisses, even more fumbled squeezes of her breasts followed by a quickie in her long forgotten boyfriend\u2019s dorm room.</p><p>Nothing that made her anxious to find a new lover in the past three years.</p><p>Not until Niko had prowled into her lab.</p><p>Clearly even a female as embarrassingly na\u00efve as she was could sense a man with the ability to please a woman.</p><p>She moaned as he outlined her mouth with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he promised, stealing a deep, drugging kiss.</p><p>She briefly savored the taste of warm male desire, her stomach clenching with anticipation as she felt the hard thrust of his arousal.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d sensed the minute he\u2019d walked into the lab.</p><p>This smoldering attraction that could burn her to cinders.</p><p>Reluctantly she pulled back, her rasping breath the only sound to disturb the silence.</p><p>\u201cJust because you can get me into bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to devote myself to proving I\u2019ll never hurt you again,\u201d he promised, his gaze locked on her lips that still tingled from his touch. \u201cNo matter how long it takes.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to think.</p><p>Who knew it could be such a difficult task?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His finger brushed her heated cheek. \u201cHmmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you concerned that I would be hurt now?\u201d she persisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you gave a rat\u2019s ass for the past six weeks.\u201d</p><p>He met her accusing gaze, his expression somber. \u201cThe Sentinels\u2014the ones who Dylan murdered\u2014were two of my closest friends.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThe pain of their loss blinded me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She refused to be swayed by the edge of pain in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSo not all Sentinels are so cold-blooded?\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cOh, we\u2019re cold-blooded, especially when we\u2019re tracking prey.\u201d His hand gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cBut a part of our mission is always to protect the innocent.\u201d</p> <p>A tiny part of Niko knew that he was behaving badly.</p><p>Again.</p><p>The poor female had nearly been kidnapped by a homicidal freak who looked like the definition of a monster. She\u2019d discovered the man she\u2019d come to trust had used her as a pawn. And then forced her against her will to travel to this remote cabin.</p><p>And that didn\u2019t even include the revelation she was also one of the freaks. Something she\u2019d obviously refused to process.</p><p>She was shaken, scared, and mad as hell.</p> <p>But was he offering her comfort? Giving her the space she needed to come to terms with the upheavals in her life?</p><p>No.</p><p>He\u2019d barely got her through the door before he had her in his arms, kissing her as if he\u2019d already claimed her as his own.</p><p>But while the small shred of decency that had survived his years as a Sentinel urged him to release her, he knew there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell of that happening.</p><p>He needed to touch her. It was a physical ache that he couldn\u2019t deny.</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d she asked, her defiant expression doing nothing to hide the vulnerability in her wide, velvet-brown eyes.</p> <p>His fingers skimmed down the curve of her neck. \u201cNow my first priority is to make certain you\u2019re out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>A fine tremor shook her body as his fingers continued down to trace the prominent line of her collarbone exposed by the drooping neckline of her sweatshirt.</p><p>Not that she was about to admit her ready response to his touch.</p><p>Once\u2014before she\u2019d discovered the truth\u2014she would have eagerly shared her desire. It had been obvious in every shy smile and charming blush when he walked into a room.</p><p>The fact that he\u2019d driven her to hide her desire was a raw regret that was going to torture him for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll return to the hunt for Dylan?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>He shrugged. Just six weeks ago he would have been infuriated by the mere question. Nothing was more important than tracking down the bitch who\u2019d killed his friends.</p><p>But his priorities had changed. While he would never be satisfied until Dylan was brought to justice, his focus was now on ensuring that Angela was protected.</p> <p>\u201cThat will be the decision of the Tagos,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s a Tagos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe commander of the Sentinels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will happen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne problem at a time, angel,\u201d he murmured, forcing himself to step back so he could pull his cell phone from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, grasping his arm, her expression troubled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to go with you.\u201d</p><p>He squashed his impulse to inform her that he didn\u2019t need her consent. After years of giving commands and having them obeyed, he was going to have to learn the art of negotiation.</p><p>A wry smile twisted his lips. He suspected it wouldn\u2019t be the first, or the last change he would have to make for this female.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I have to check in and let them know Dylan is still out there,\u201d he said.</p><p>She regarded him with open suspicion. \u201cNo tricks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo tricks.\u201d He leaned down to brush his lips over her furrowed brow. \u201cThe kitchen is fully stocked. See if there\u2019s anything that you\u2019d like for dinner.\u201d</p><p>She took a hasty step backward, a revealing blush staining her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a groan, the sweet taste of her skin clinging to his lips and the scent of her frustrated desire teasing his nose.</p><p>Sometimes superior senses weren\u2019t always a bonus.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eat, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted down the length of her slender body before returning to meet her wide gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m hungry for isn\u2019t in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but perhaps aware he was looking for any excuse to yank her back into his arms and consume her on the spot, she turned to scurry toward the wide doors that led to the back of the cabin.</p><p>He breathed deeply of her lingering scent before pressing the number to Valhalla on his cell phone.</p><p>Within seconds he was patched through to Wolfe, the current Talos, and all-around badass.</p><p>\u201cYou have her?\u201d the powerful leader of the Sentinels demanded, not bothering with pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cNot Dylan, but I have the scientist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let your prey escape?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There was a startled silence before Wolfe sucked in an audible breath.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Niko.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been . . .\u201d It took an effort to say the word he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d utter. \u201cCompromised.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe muttered a low curse. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no longer impartial,\u201d he said, proving the point as he crossed the room so he could keep Angela in sight as she entered the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my judgment can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us are impartial,\u201d Wolfe said in rough tones, the words thick with self-disgust. As Tagos, Wolfe held himself personally responsible for the death of Adam and Fiona. Not that he wouldn\u2019t have even if he wasn\u2019t the leader. Calling Wolfe a control freak was like calling a nuclear bomb a small explosive. \u201cDylan\u2019s betrayal has affected us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is more than my thirst for revenge,\u201d Niko confessed without apology. Odd. He should be horrified by the thought that he was about to let a female come between him and his duty. Instead all he wanted was to be done with the conversation so he could head into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve allowed myself to become personally invested in Angela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scientist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well.\u201d</p><p>Niko ignored the mocking drawl in his friend\u2019s voice. Wolfe was notorious for his belief that Sentinels shouldn\u2019t allow distractions in their lives. Lovers were fine as long as they understood they came in a distant second place to the job.</p><p>\u201cI need to get her to Valhalla,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there might be a problem.\u201d</p><p>He could sense that Wolfe was on instant alert. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s not that long a drive.\u201d</p><p>Niko grimaced. \u201cNo, but I can\u2019t be sure Dylan is working alone. I\u2019d be vulnerable to attack on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>Niko rolled his eyes. All Sentinels were hyperperceptive. It was part of their special ability.</p><p>But Wolfe was very close to being a psychic.</p><p>Annoying bastard.</p><p>\u201cAngela is not entirely pleased by the thought of going to the freak-house,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure that once we\u2019re away from a controlled environment she won\u2019t try to escape.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe\u2019s bark of laughter echoed through the phone. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t become a slave to your charm? There was a time when you only had to smile to get a woman to devote herself to your pleasure. You must be losing your touch, old man.\u201d</p><p>Niko ignored the insult. He couldn\u2019t tease about his feelings for Angela. Or the fact that he\u2019d hurt her so badly he couldn\u2019t be sure she would ever forgive him.</p><p>\u201cGive me a few hours to convince her that I\u2019m not entirely evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Do you intend to do this convincing in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your business.\u201d</p><p>Wolfe gave a short laugh that ended on a weary sigh. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the best. Things are . . . tense right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Dylan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The Mave is convinced we\u2019ll be able to clean up that nasty business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not entirely certain, but it has something to do with the necros. Which means their Sentinels refuse to leave their sides. You know how overprotective they are.\u201d</p><p>Necromancers (or diviners as they preferred to be called) were bonded to a guardian Sentinel while they were still young, never leaving the protection of Valhalla or outlying compounds without one at their side.</p><p>\u201cA threat?\u201d</p><p>Wolfe made a sound of disgust. \u201cWhy would they tell me? I am, after all, only the leader of the Sentinels. It\u2019s not like I need to be kept in the damned loop.\u201d</p><p>Niko grimaced. Politics sucked. Especially for a man who had the tact of a raging bull.</p><p>\u201cArel shouldn\u2019t be too far away,\u201d he said, eager to change the conversation. \u201cCould you have him join me at the cabin? The sooner he can get on Dylan\u2019s trail the better.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Wolfe was back in commander mode.</p><p>\u201cWill he need backup?\u201d</p><p>The memory of the hatred blazing in Dylan\u2019s crimson eyes made the question easy to answer.</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t tell him I said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, although it will be a few hours before any backup can get there since they have to drive.\u201d A pause. \u201cNiko.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, and give that scientist a kiss for me.\u201d</p><p>Not a chance in hell.</p><p>\u201cYou should know by now, Wolfe, I don\u2019t share,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Angela was impressed.</p> <p>So this was what a kitchen was supposed to look like, she wryly acknowledged.</p><p>It was more than the hand-carved cabinets, granite countertops, and stainless steel appliances. It was the heavy oak dining table in the center of the ceramic tiled floor and the matching china cabinet that displayed the prized dishware.</p><p>This was a place where families gathered to share meals and laugh away the troubles of the day.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a makeshift lab for a distracted scientist. Or a place for a child to sit alone with dinner from the microwave while her mother was flirting with her fellow drunks at the nearest bar.</p><p>She squashed the ridiculous pang. She wasn\u2019t that lonely ten-year-old girl anymore and she was perfectly happy with her private apartment and her kitchen filled with microscopes.</p><p>Pulling a water bottle from the fully loaded fridge, she was debating between a salad and a tuna sandwich when a husky voice whispered in her ear.</p> <p>\u201cDid you find anything to tempt your appetite?\u201d</p><p>With a muffled shriek she turned to glare at the man towering over her.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d she muttered, pressing a hand to her racing heart. \u201cYou really need to wear a bell.\u201d</p><p>He flashed his rare, bone-melting grin. \u201cKinky, but whatever turns you on.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed a groan as desire blazed through her with stunning force.</p><p>Even furious with his betrayal and unnerved by the disruption of her peaceful life, she still wanted him with a raw, aching need that was frightening.</p><p>Against her will her gaze drank in the lean, starkly beautiful face and stunning blue eyes that studied her with an unwavering intensity. His hair was even more ruffled than usual and her fingers itched to smooth the dark strands that shimmered like copper in the fading afternoon sunlight.</p><p>Then they could travel down to discover if his body was the chiseled perfection she\u2019d always fantasized.</p> <p>Abruptly realizing his eyes had darkened, as if he could actually sense her disturbing awareness, she shut the fridge door. Instantly she stepped back as his heat wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you have to practice sneaking up on people?\u201d she breathed, shivering at the prickles that raced over her skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a natural talent.\u201d He closed the tiny space between them, reaching to pluck the water bottle from her hand and tossed it into the recycle bin. \u201cOne of many.\u201d</p><p>She licked her dry lips. \u201cIs modesty another natural talent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but this is.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to capture her lips in a kiss of sheer possession.</p><p>\u201cNiko,\u201d she muttered, the breath squeezed from her lungs as he wrapped his arms around her, moving slowly, as if to give her ample opportunity to step away.</p><p>Or perhaps he was worried his superior powers would frighten her, she realized as he gently tugged her against him.</p><p>Tilting back her head she met his smoldering gaze.</p><p>\u201cTell me no and this ends now,\u201d he husked.</p><p>Her lips parted, but the word was stuck in her throat. \u201cI thought you wanted dinner?\u201d she instead hedged.</p><p>His hand shifted to her lower back, pressing her against the thickening length of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, her hands lifting to rest against his chest. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>His tongue traced the curve of her lower lip. \u201cI can demonstrate if you need clarification.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she wanted him to demonstrate.</p><p>She wanted him to rip off her clothes and take her in a glorious storm of pagan passion. She wanted him to kiss her with a hunger that would drown out the voice of insecurity that whispered in the back of her mind.</p><p>\u201cIt seems\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenient?\u201d He made a sound of disbelief. \u201cTrust me, lusting after a female for six weeks is anything but convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were so overwhelmed with lust you hid it well enough. I did everything but spread myself naked on the lab table and you couldn\u2019t have shown less interest.\u201d She lowered her gaze, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment at the memory of her awkward flirtations and his blatant apathy. He\u2019d only reinforced her opinion she was lacking the mysterious quality that attracted the opposite sex. \u201cNow, when you need my cooperation, you suddenly find me irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, look at me,\u201d he said, cupping a hand beneath her chin, urging her face up to meet his eyes that were darkened with regret.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt might not have been my intention to hurt you, but I did,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou felt betrayed by my charade; can you imagine how much worse it would have been if I\u2019d given in to my desire and taken you to my bed? Not even I am that much a bastard.\u201d</p><p>The resentment she\u2019d been nursing for the past few hours faltered at his low words.</p><p>\u201cSo it was for my own good?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid to her mouth. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t for mine.\u201d</p><p>He had a point, a tiny voice whispered in the back of her mind. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever have been able to forgive him if he\u2019d actually taken her as a lover while he\u2019d been lying to her.</p><p>Still, that didn\u2019t mean this wasn\u2019t just another game.</p><p>\u201cIf you say.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou can\u2019t doubt my desire for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you wouldn\u2019t be the first man to want to be \u2018just friends,\u2019\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Angela,\u201d he breathed. \u201cAs much as I want to be your friend, I\u2019m desperate to make you my lover.\u201d</p><p>Her heart missed a beat as she met his brooding gaze. \u201cDesperate?\u201d</p><p>Without warning he grasped her wrist and pressed her hand against the thick length of his erection.</p><p>\u201cTell me, angel, does this feel desperate to you?\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her suspicions were seared away as her fingers curled around the impressive bulge. Even through the heavy material of his jeans she could feel the pulsing heat and straining urgency of his need.</p><p>It was intoxicating.</p><p>Her mouth went dry as her stomach clenched with excitement. She\u2019d never understood why women rushed to the window when the football team jogged past wearing nothing more than gym shorts. The male body was a collection of vital organs surrounded by muscle and bone and hard-wired to a brain that allowed it to function.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until this man entered her lab that she got it.</p><p>Just being near Niko was like being plunged into an electrical storm. The heat, the sizzle in the air, and the prickles of anticipation that warned she was about to be struck by lightning.</p><p>And worse, her brain shut down until all she could think about was wrapping herself so tightly around him he could never escape.</p><p>Dangerous, dangerous sensations.</p><p>Her fingers slid down his erection, her heart skipping a beat as he seemed to grow even bigger.</p><p>\u201cIt feels\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he groaned, his hands gripping her shoulders as if he wasn\u2019t convinced his knees would hold him.</p><p>Angela felt a strange jolt of . . . what was it? Female power?</p><p>He wanted her.</p><p>Truly wanted her.</p><p>Of all the lies he told her this wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>\u201cLarge,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He gave a choked laugh, his face tight with his barely leashed desire.</p><p>\u201cShould I be flattered?\u201d</p><p>Her awkwardness was forgotten beneath the heady realization that she could affect this man with a mere touch.</p><p>\u201cNot really, I don\u2019t have much to compare it to,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ve never been the kind of girl that attracts the opposite sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because mortal men are blind.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>He studied her upturned face with an undisguised hunger that squeezed the air from her lungs.</p><p>\u201cIf they had the superior senses of a Sentinel they would have seen what I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d she managed to ask.</p><p>He lifted a hand to tug the scrunchie from the messy remains of her ponytail.</p><p>\u201cThick, sable hair that starts out prim and proper in the mornings, but during the day sexy little tendrils escape to play against your long, utterly kissable neck.\u201d</p><p>She trembled as his fingers threaded through the loose strands of her hair.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat as he lifted a fistful of hair to press it to his nose, breathing deeply of the apple shampoo she used.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many hours I devoted to fantasizing about releasing your hair from its bondage so it could spread across my pillows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBondage?\u201d The word came out as a croak as she all too easily pictured being handcuffed to Niko\u2019s bed, her body a willing slave to the promise of paradise.</p><p>Keeping one hand tangled in her hair, he used the other to gently trace the sensitive skin of her temple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDark velvet eyes that tempt a man to become lost in their depths,\u201d he continued his verbal seduction, his voice smoky.</p><p>\u201cBoring brown,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He ignored her interruption, his smoldering gaze tracing every line and angle of her upturned face.</p> <p>\u201cA noble little nose,\u201d he murmured. \u201cDid you know you scrunch it up when you\u2019re concentrating on your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>His fingers drifted down to trace her nose before outlining her trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cA mouth that is as ripe and delicious as cherries.\u201d</p><p>Her lips instinctively parted at his searing touch. \u201cNiko.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd this skin.\u201d The warm fingers continued their path of destruction down the length of her neck to trace the loose neckline of her sweatshirt. \u201cAs smooth as the most expensive silk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d he growled in response. \u201cIvory silk.

And that if she agreed there would be no turning back.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Obviously a man of action, Niko didn\u2019t hesitate to pull the sweatshirt up and off her body. It happened so fast that Angela didn\u2019t have time to feel embarrassed. Then, catching sight of Niko\u2019s harshly appreciative expression, she forgot to worry that she was too skinny, or too pale, or too whatever else her insecurities could imagine.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he rasped as his hands reached to dispense with her lacy bra. \u201cIvory tipped with rosebuds. An irresistible combination.\u201d</p><p>His fingers cupped the small mounds of her breasts, his thumbs teasing the nipples to tiny points of aching pleasure. She sucked in a startled gasp, her back arching as if to beg for more.</p><p>Muttering a low, rough curse, he lowered his head and licked the tip of her breast.</p><p>Angela jerked in astonishment, her hands lifting to plunge into the short strands of his hair.</p><p>\u201cDear . . . Lord.\u201d</p><p>His own hands slid down the curve of her waist, tugging her against his rigid muscles at the same time he sucked her nipple between his lips.</p><p>She groaned, as he caught the tip between his teeth. It felt so good. Blissfully, wondrously good.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered, kissing a path to her other breast to torment it with the same dizzying skill.</p> <p>\u201cI want you too,\u201d she husked.</p><p>And she did.</p><p>What had his word been?</p><p>Desperately. Yes, that was it.</p><p>She wanted him desperately.</p><p>This was chemistry at its most basic form.</p><p>He made a low sound deep in his throat, planting impatient kisses up the line of her collarbone until he buried his face in the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>He pulled back with a frown. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. She\u2019d spent six weeks tormenting herself with the fear that this man who filled her every fantasy could never desire her.</p><p>Now that she was in his arm, hovering on the edge of paradise, she didn\u2019t want it snatched away.</p><p>Just once she wanted to say the hell with logic and common sense and give in to temptation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me a reason why we can\u2019t do this,\u201d she muttered. His hooded gaze skimmed down to her nipples that remained hardened with desire before returning to meet her frustrated gaze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more a warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warning? Oh.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not stupid. I know the routine. This is just sex. It means nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The blue eyes flared with a stunning emotion. \u201cIt means everything.\u201d</p><p>If Niko hadn\u2019t been battling his caveman urge to strip Angela of her remaining clothes and take her against the fridge, he would have smiled at her baffled expression.</p><p>Hell, he didn\u2019t blame her for looking at him like he was out of his mind.</p><p>Until he\u2019d encountered this woman he would have bet his left nut he would never utter those words.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d He gently brushed a stray curl from her flushed cheek. \u201cFor me this isn\u2019t just sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend, Niko.\u201d She unconsciously licked her lips, her expression troubled. \u201cIn fact, I would prefer that you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>With a low growl he was scooping her off her feet and heading out of the kitchen.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was the lip-licking or her refusal to believe that he was sincere that tipped him over the edge, but he knew that one way or another he was going to convince her that this was no longer a matter of duty or revenge or mere lust.</p><p>Crossing the living room he carried her up the stairs and into the bedroom loft.</p><p>It was a spacious room with an open beamed ceiling and hand-carved furniture scattered across the polished wood floor. At the far end of the room were glass sliding doors that led to a back balcony that offered a view of the pool as the sun slid beyond the horizon.</p><p>A beautiful sight, but not nearly as beautiful as the woman in his arms.</p><p>Niko moved to gently place Angela on the large brass bed. Then, standing at the edge of the mattress, he simply relished the sight of her stretched across the emerald green comforter.</p><p>Man. How many nights had he tortured himself with this precise image?</p><p>The dark hair spread in wild abandon. The pale face flushed with need and the midnight eyes smoldering with invitation.</p><p>Only this was far better than any fantasy.</p><p>A fiercely possessive emotion clutched at his heart as his gaze slid down the delicate curve of her neck and over the soft swell of her naked breasts.</p><p>It was raw and primal and shockingly perfect.</p><p>With jerky movements that would have made his fellow Sentinels snicker, Niko kicked off his shoes before removing the rest of his clothes. He was acutely aware of Angela\u2019s covert survey of his nude body, her breath catching as she caught sight of his fully erect cock.</p><p>For once his vanity didn\u2019t assume she was impressed by his lean muscles or his wide chest sprinkled with dark hair. Or even the imposing size of his erection.</p><p>For all of Angela Locke\u2019s impressive intelligence and independent nature, she was still remarkably innocent. Combine that with her mysterious conviction she was somehow undesirable and it was bound to make her skittish.</p><p>Moving slow enough it didn\u2019t seem like he was pouncing (pouncing could come next time . . . and there would be a next time) Niko stretched out on the mattress beside her so that they were lying face to face. His only touch was the finger he used to trace the line of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cNo more pretense,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe truth. Once I take you I\u2019m never letting you go.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, her body shifting to press against him even as her eyes held a suspicion she couldn\u2019t entirely disguise.</p><p>\u201cIf this is a ploy to get me in Valhalla . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already given my word I won\u2019t force you to go to the compound,\u201d he said, his voice thick as his cock jerked in reaction to the brush of her hip.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that where you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, but Sentinels aren\u2019t vulnerable like many of the high-bloods, so we have the choice of living among norms,\u201d he assured her, not bothering to mention that she\u2019d eventually have to spend time at Valhalla. The Mave would want to be certain her growing powers couldn\u2019t hurt her or those around her. Yeah, that was a conversation he didn\u2019t mind putting off. Indefinitely. \u201cOnce Dylan has been captured we can go wherever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He smiled wryly as her words disappeared and she stared at him with silent wonder.</p><p>\u201cToo much, too soon?\u201d he teased.</p><p>With a choked groan she wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He did.</p><p>White-hot pleasure seared through Angela as he kissed with a clear intent.</p><p>This time there was no teasing, no slow buildup, no tender nibbles.</p><p>This was unapologetic hunger that threatened to consume her.</p><p>And exactly what she needed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think of the past, and the future was something to worry about . . . later.</p><p>She wanted to become lost in this moment.</p><p>As if sensing her need, Niko\u2019s kiss became even more demanding, his tongue dipping into her mouth with an intimate sweep. In concert, his hand cupped her breast, his thumb rubbing over the tight peak.</p><p>Angela squirmed against him as the electric sensations jolted through her.</p><p>\u201cNiko.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, studying with a hint of concern.</p><p>\u201cAm I frightening you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her heart squeezed with a dangerous emotion. God, he was so beautiful. A sexy, lethally beautiful male who had enchanted her the minute he\u2019d strolled into her lab.</p><p>But it was his instinctive urge to care and protect her that threatened to destroy the barriers she\u2019d built around her heart.</p><p>No one had ever, ever treated her as if she . . . mattered.</p><p>As if she was the most important thing in his life.</p><p>The knowledge was more erotic than any amount of hard muscles and male beauty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His brows drew together. \u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>In answer, she plunged her fingers into the heavy thickness of his hair.</p><p>\u201cI have wanted you from the moment I saw you in the doorway of my lab,\u201d she confessed in soft tones. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what hit me.\u201d</p> <p>His soft chuckle brushed over her cheeks, his eyes darkened to indigo.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, the feeling was entirely mutual.\u201d Holding her gaze he slid his hand down the flat plane of her stomach until he could unfasten her jeans. \u201cI tried to convince myself that you were just a part of the job, but I knew from the beginning I was lying to myself.\u201d</p><p>Her body felt as if it was on fire as he expertly rid her of her remaining clothes. Then, still holding her gaze, he slid slowly downward. The rub of skin against skin made her shiver with excitement.</p><p>His lips touched the base of her throat before moving to her collarbone, tracing the delicate line with the tip of his tongue. Only when she was clutching at his broad shoulders did he allow the teasing kisses to travel down the curve of her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so warm,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cAll Sentinels run hot.\u201d He shifted just enough to capture the tip of her nipple between his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She nearly came off the bed at the avalanche of sensations rushing through her body.</p><p>He was good at this.</p><p>Really, really good.</p><p>While his tongue and even his teeth pleasured her nipple, his hand slid down the curve of her hip. Angela squeezed her eyes shut, allowing herself the pleasure of exploring the broad width of his back, relishing the feel of silken skin over hard muscle.</p> <p>She was growing lost in the surge of building sensations when his fingers encircled the back of her thigh and tugged her leg over his hip.</p><p>Her eyes widened as she felt the hard thrust of his arousal press against her most sensitive spot. She\u2019d expected him to roll her onto her back, not to remain on their sides.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her hint of surprise. \u201cWe can do it anyway you want, but I\u2019ve wanted you for a very long time. This seems . . . safer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m several sizes larger than you.\u201d</p><p>Her own lips twitched. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d noticed.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded as he studied her with an oddly somber expression even as his fingers drifted up and down the back of her thigh, the light touch sending shocks of excitement through her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m also a Sentinel, which means my strength can be hazardous if I\u2019m not careful.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes briefly closed, as if her soft words had touched something deep inside him. Then, lifting the indecently long lashes, he met her gaze with a stark need that pierced straight to her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted a woman like I want you, angel,\u201d he said, his voice husky. \u201cI can\u2019t be entirely certain of my control.\u201d</p><p>That newly discovered thrill of power flared through her. She didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d ever managed to capture the interest of this astonishing, sexy, compelling man. But for once she wasn\u2019t going to allow her self-doubts to ruin the moment.</p><p>Angela leaned forward, nuzzling the corner of his sensuous lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d She kissed a path along his knotted jaw and then the strong column of his neck, addicted to his intoxicating taste. \u201cYou would never hurt me. Not intentionally.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cNo, I would never intentionally hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She slowly kissed a path back to his lips, her hips rubbing against him in blatant invitation.</p><p>\u201cNo more talking.\u201d</p><p>Framing her face in his hands, he claimed her lips in a kiss that she felt to the tips of her toes. Oh . . . yes. She shivered with pleasure, her mouth parting to allow his tongue to tangle with hers.</p><p>Drowning in the heat of his devouring kiss, she stroked her hands over the hair-roughened skin of his chest. A delicious excitement curled in the pit of her stomach as he tugged her leg higher on his hip, the tip of his cock sliding through her damp clit.</p><p>She hissed in pleasure, her nails digging into his chest.</p><p>Easily sensing the growing urgency of her desire, Niko pulled back, his face strained as he struggled to maintain control of his spiraling desire.</p><p>\u201cAngel, I can\u2019t wait,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI need to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>His rough voice sent a flare of aching desire through her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, shuddering as his fingers drifted over the curve of her hip.</p><p>With infinite care he explored the tender skin of her lower stomach before heading ever lower.</p><p>Angela muttered her approval as he covered her lips in a hungry kiss, but even distracted she gave a strangled groan when his seeking fingers stroked through her damp heat.</p><p>\u201cGod, you feel good,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAre you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>Ready?</p><p>Hell, she\u2019d been ready for weeks.</p><p>Another stroke or two of those clever fingers and she\u2019d be reaching paradise alone.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Niko,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>His low hiss filled the air, his erection pressing eagerly against her damp heat.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He gazed deep into her eyes, a thin layer of sweat coating his face.</p><p>\u201cNext time I intend to spend hours pleasuring you.\u201d</p><p>A sly smile curved her lips. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>His control snapped.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Reclaiming her lips, Niko\u2019s hands shifted to her lower back and with a forward thrust of his hips he was entering her in one sure stroke.</p><p>She gasped, but not from fear.</p><p>Exquisite pleasure blazed through her and she pressed her face into the curve of his neck. She\u2019d never done anything but the traditional missionary position. Now she realized that the current arrangement allowed her to feel every slow stroke into her before he was retreating and returning with a slow, insistent thrust.</p><p>\u201cNiko,\u201d she breathed, feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>It was more than the extraordinary bliss of feeling him moving deep inside her. It was the sense of intimate connection with this man that went beyond the physical.</p><p>\u201cI knew it would be perfect,\u201d he whispered as he continued his measured pace. \u201cI knew you would be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever realized what, my sweet angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat this could be so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife altering,\u201d she breathed, her body moving in perfect rhythm with his.</p><p>His low laugh echoed through the air with an unmistakable satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to me now,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>Belonged?</p><p>If she\u2019d been in her right mind, she might have protested the possessive comment.</p><p>But instead she arched her back as her body began to tighten with a shimmering anticipation. His steady, unrelenting pace was stoking an inferno deep within her that threatened to combust.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he breathed, giving her leg a tug higher as he angled his hips upward.</p><p>His slight shift was enough to press him even deeper within her and with a shocking force the tension that coiled between her legs abruptly shattered into a thousand pieces.</p><p>She cried out and wrapped her arms around his neck as he gave two more deep thrusts before he was reaching his own climax.</p><p>She held on tightly as they both struggled to recover from the explosion of sensations, their ragged breaths the only sound to stir the air.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Niko ran a shaky hand down the damp skin of Angela\u2019s back, his face buried in her apple-scented hair.</p><p>Man, he ached to press her even closer to his trembling body. To hold her so tightly she would never be able to escape. But even now he feared he might accidentally crush her.</p><p>She was so fragile. So vulnerable.</p><p>The knowledge frightened him on a primal level that threatened to make him do something extremely stupid.</p><p>Like lock her in his rooms at Valhalla and never let her out.</p><p>Something that this fiercely independent woman would most certainly protest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quiet,\u201d he at last murmured, lifting his head to study her with a searching gaze. She\u2019d never looked more beautiful with her hair tangled around her flushed face and her lips still swollen from his kisses. But he was a Sentinel. He didn\u2019t miss the hint of unease behind her air of sleepy satisfaction. \u201cAre you having regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She used her finger to draw an aimless pattern over his chest, seemingly unaware that the light caress was enough to kick his libido into overdrive. Of course, just being close to this female was enough to send his libido into overdrive. Or catching her scent. Or seeing her across the room . . .</p><p>He swallowed a groan, grimly leashing his insistent desire.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a fleeting afternoon of delight.</p><p>This was the start of eternity.</p><p>Together.</p><p>He needed to know what was going on in that clever, always unpredictable brain of hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, angel?\u201d</p><p>A brief hesitation. \u201cI was just thinking that we don\u2019t really know much about each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand skimmed beneath the warm silk of her hair, massaging the tense muscles of her nape.</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re beautiful, frighteningly intelligent, and that you dislike being the center of attention,\u201d he promptly informed her.

I could run faster, jump higher, see better, and hear things no one else could.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAnd that was a bad thing?\u201d</p> <p>His jaw clenched at the memory of the hateful taunts and brutal ambushes that had dogged his early years.</p><p>\u201cBoys can be extremely competitive and no one wants to play with the kid who always wins.\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened with sympathy. \u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was before my super strength kicked in.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers spread across his chest. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly killed a neighborhood boy when he threw a rock and hit me in the head.\u201d He grimaced. The memory of the boy lying on the ground with his face beaten bloody was one that had haunted him for years. \u201cThat\u2019s when my mom called Valhalla.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they come and take you away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted to cup his face, her heart far too tender for her own good.</p><p>\u201cWere you unhappy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMy mother came to visit when she could, but I\u2019d become too wary to make friends.\u201d His lips twisted. He\u2019d been a surly, arrogant kid with a chip on his shoulder the size of Mount Rushmore. In no way did he want to admit he was one of the mutants. \u201cEspecially when they were all freaks.\u201d</p><p>Her thumb absently stroked his lower lip, sending a blast of heat through him.</p><p>Oh . . . yeah.</p><p>He was definitely locking her in his rooms. Their rooms. At least for the next month or so.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolfe, a boy a few years older than me, walked up and punched me so hard he broke my jaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d she growled in outrage. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>His lips parted into a wide smile. \u201cExactly what you\u2019d expect me to do. I picked myself off the floor and did my best to kill the son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepened. \u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I discovered that I\u2019d finally encountered someone who could not only match me in strength, but could kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Of course she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Only two males could appreciate the nuanced diplomacy of a knock-down-drag-out fight.</p><p>\u201cFor the first time ever I didn\u2019t have to hold back. I didn\u2019t have to pretend I was \u2018less\u2019 than what I was.\u201d He deliberately caught and held her gaze. \u201cI found the place where I belonged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Wolfe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the current leader of the Sentinels and my closest friend.\u201d</p><p>She lightly ran her fingers up and down the line of his jaw, seemingly fascinated by the feel of his five o\u2019clock shadow.</p><p>\u201cYou never mentioned your father.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hand to press her palm against his cheek. \u201cHe died when I was just a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes instantly lowered to hide her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was the product of a one-night stand,\u201d she said, her voice stripped of emotion. \u201cI never knew my father, not even his name. I doubt he ever knew I existed.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a sigh as he felt the barriers rising between them.</p><p>One bout of sex, no matter how life-altering, wasn\u2019t going to be enough to convince her to lower the barriers surrounding her heart.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe died a year ago.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand to his lips, planting a kiss in the middle of her palm.</p><p>\u201cThat must have been tough.\u201d</p><p>She trembled in response to his caress, but her eyes remained stubbornly hidden behind her lashes. She\u2019d share her body, but not her wounds.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we weren\u2019t close.\u201d She struggled to swallow, as if she had a lump in her throat. \u201cShe never understood my lack of social skills and she was disappointed that I spent more time in the library than with the other kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisappointed in you?\u201d He didn\u2019t have to pretend his angry astonishment. \u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want a valedictorian, she wanted a prom queen.\u201d A humorless smile curved her lips. \u201cOr at the very least a cheerleader.\u201d</p><p>He swore beneath his breath, wishing her mother was still alive so he could teach her just how special her daughter truly was.</p><p>And more importantly, what he did to people who would dare to hurt this female.</p><p>\u201cHer loss,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, wondering if there\u2019d been more to her mother\u2019s disapproval than a shallow desire for glitz rather than gold.</p><p>\u201cDid she ever sense you were special?\u201d</p><p>She tugged her hand from his grasp, pressing it against his chest in instant denial.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI won\u2019t discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenying your powers won\u2019t make them go away.\u201d</p><p>She gave another shove against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a sigh. At some point he was going to have to make her accept the truth of who and what she was.</p><p>But not now.</p><p>Now he had her naked in his bed, and there were far more pleasurable ways to spend the next few hours.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he murmured, pressing his lips to her forehead, his hand trailing up the curve of her waist to halt just below her breast.</p><p>Her breath caught and she instinctively arched toward his hardening cock.</p><p>\u201cNiko?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019ll feed you,\u201d he promised, nipping the lobe of her ear as he rolled her flat on her back and covered her with the hard weight of his body. \u201cAnything you want.\u201d His hand closed over her breast, his heart coming to a complete halt as he gazed down at her wide, velvet eyes. His. His woman. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Her hands lifted to wrap around his neck, her eyes smoldering with a matching desire.</p><p>\u201cMuch later.\u201d</p><p>It was, in fact, much, much later when Niko at last headed for the shower and Angela made her way down to the kitchen wearing nothing more than an oversized T-shirt.</p><p>She\u2019d discovered once she opened her bag that it was never wise to try and pack when in a blind panic. Her hasty lack of attention had made certain she had a plethora of things she didn\u2019t need\u2014like mismatched socks and dirty towels\u2014and very little that she did need.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>Her luck had never been good. And lately it\u2019d been downright crappy.</p><p>Well, except for Niko, she admitted, a precious warmth settled in the center of her heart. He was, hands down, the finest thing that had ever happened to her.</p><p>Still, it would have been nice to have her own nightshirt and a toothbrush.</p><p>Tossing a handful of dried cranberries into the large salad she\u2019d chopped in a bowl, she was debating whether or not to make a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches when a male voice whispered directly in her ear.</p><p>\u201cAh, so this is where Little Red Riding Hood hides from the big bad wolf.\u201d</p><p>Nearly leaping out of her skin, Angela whirled around to discover a stranger standing far too close for comfort.</p><p>A part of her recognized the intruder was mouthwateringly handsome with pale brown hair that was highlighted with strands of honey and eyes that were a rich gold. But a larger part was far more concerned with the lean, muscular body casually dressed in jeans and a black tee that moved with the same fluid grace as Niko.</p><p>This was no harmless trespasser.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She pressed a hand to her thumping heart. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Arel. A friend of Niko\u2019s.\u201d The golden gaze skimmed down her slender body. Not so much ogling her barely covered limbs, but searching for potential defects. \u201cHe asked me to meet him here.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Like she was going to take his word for it.</p><p>People who were invited knocked on the front door and waited to be let in. They didn\u2019t creep into the kitchen and terrify half-dressed scientists. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Covertly backing toward the counter behind her, Angela sought to distract the intruder.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerra gave me the security codes during our short, but highly memorable affair last year.\u201d A smile of pure male appreciation curved his lips. \u201cMmm. I love psychics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She wrinkled her nose as she put her hand behind her to search for the knob of the drawer. \u201cTMI.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest, watching her with an amused gaze.</p><p>\u201cThe knife drawer is on the other side of the sink,\u201d he informed her. \u201cOf course, I seem to remember there was a rather lethal rolling pin just behind you.\u201d</p><p>Busted.</p><p>With a sigh, Angela gave up her furtive attempt to find a weapon and instead settled for a frustrated glare.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re another Sentinel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou people should really learn it\u2019s not nice to sneak up on others.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOld habits die hard and I have to admit I wanted a chance to check you out before we were formally introduced.\u201d</p><p>Check her out?</p><p>That sounded . . . borderline psychotic.</p> <p>\u201cDo I need to get a restraining order?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at her obvious unease. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame my fascination,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Niko for a very long time and never in all those years has he allowed anything or anyone to interfere with the hunt.\u201d His gaze skimmed back to her bare legs. \u201cNot even a woman.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Okay, maybe he did know Niko. At least enough to realize that Niko would do anything to catch his prey.</p><p>Still, that didn\u2019t mean he was there as a friend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Niko\u2019s record remains intact,\u201d she assured him wryly. \u201cI was the bait, not the interference.\u201d</p><p>The intruder arched a startled brow. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because he called Wolfe to say he was handing off his hunt for Dylan,\u201d he said, a mysterious smile curving his lips. \u201cHe wanted me to take his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned that assumptions can be dangerous things,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cAh. Fair enough.\u201d He studied her with a steady gaze. \u201cHe asked me to take over the hunt because he wanted to concentrate on protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Niko had hinted that he intended to put aside his need for revenge and concentrate on her, but she hadn\u2019t truly thought he would allow someone else to take command of the hunt.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d the man challenged. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>He appeared unimpressed with her reaction. \u201cDid he tell you about the Sentinels that Dylan murdered?\u201d</p><p>She licked her dry lips. He was clearly searching for a response from her, but as always she was oblivious to the nuances of his meaning.</p><p>\u201cHe said they were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hell of a lot more than friends,\u201d Arel growled. \u201cHe practically raised Fiona. She was like a daughter to him.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s heart twisted in sympathy. She was beginning to understand Niko. It wouldn\u2019t be enough that he would mourn the loss of his friends. Especially one he\u2019d felt responsible for.</p><p>He would blame himself for their deaths.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she demanded in thick tones.</p><p>\u201cI want you to understand just what Niko is sacrificing to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Arel,\u201d Niko warned, leaning against the doorjamb wearing nothing more than a pair of faded jeans and a dangerous scowl.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Niko folded his arms over his bare chest, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>If he had been in a rational frame of mind, he might have appreciated Arel\u2019s loyal attempt to protect him. It was, after all, what friends did. But there was nothing rational in his feelings for Angela, and he wasn\u2019t about to allow anyone to threaten her.</p><p>No matter how well intentioned.</p><p>Easily sensing the tension, Angela cleared her throat then began edging toward the doorway. She didn\u2019t need her genius-level intelligence to realize that it was time for a strategic retreat.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go take a shower,\u201d she muttered, giving a tiny gasp when he grabbed her by the waist and claimed a possessive kiss before allowing her to scurry away, his gaze never leaving Arel.</p><p>With a roll of his eyes, the young Sentinel lifted his hands in defeat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve made your point.\u201d</p><p>The words were casual, but Niko was well aware that having accepted Niko\u2019s commitment to Angela, Arel would fight to the death to protect her.</p><p>It was the way of Sentinels.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d he asked, moving to lean against the countertop.</p><p>Sentinels burned calories at an accelerated rate, which meant they were always hungry.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hit a drive-thru before leaving Columbia.\u201d Arel\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cTell me about your meeting with Dylan.\u201d</p><p>Niko grimaced. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to be convinced to turn herself over to the Mave.\u201d</p><p>Arel shrugged. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She never allowed herself to accept being different,\u201d Arel said. \u201cShe was a time bomb just waiting to go off no matter how hard Wolfe tried to diffuse her bitterness.\u201d</p><p>Niko couldn\u2019t argue. Wolfe had done everything in his power to reach the hostile young woman, but she\u2019d never been capable of accepting that she would never be normal.</p><p>\u201cA damned shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be more of a shame if she gets her hands on your scientist,\u201d Arel pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happening.\u201d His expression held no compromise. He would do whatever necessary to protect Angela.</p><p>Arel paced toward the windows overlooking the pool. \u201cDo you think Dylan\u2019s still in the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Niko responded without hesitation. \u201cShe won\u2019t leave until I get Angela out of here.\u201d</p><p>There was a short silence before Arel turned back to study Niko\u2019s grim expression.</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould Angela alter Dylan\u2019s DNA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Niko hadn\u2019t given it a lot of thought. His fascination with Angela had nothing to do with her rare talent. \u201cAccording to Calder, her manipulation of cells, or whatever the hell it is she manipulates, is still small and random, but he has hopes that once she fully embraces her talent she\u2019ll be able to offer hope to high-bloods who suffer from mutations that are killing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur very own Dr. Frankenstein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d Niko growled.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an insult,\u201d Arel hastily assured him. \u201cJust the opposite. Think of the potential benefits of having her work with our scientists. She could save hundreds if not thousands of lives.\u201d</p><p>Niko shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to know how far her skills will develop. Or even if she\u2019ll be willing to accept her gifts.\u201d He deliberately held his friend\u2019s gaze. \u201cIt will be her decision. I won\u2019t have her bullied into giving more than she\u2019s willing to offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if she can help your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is my family.\u201d Niko straightened, his gaze challenging. \u201cAny argument?\u201d</p><p>Arel gave a sudden laugh. \u201cNiko, if I ever find a female who lights up like a neon sign just because I walked into a room I intend to do whatever I have to do to keep her.\u201d</p><p>Niko stilled, ridiculously pleased by the soft words. \u201cA neon sign? Did she?\u201d</p><p>Arel shook his head in disgust. \u201cWipe that smug smile off your lips. There had to be one woman in the world crazy enough to fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God. How the mighty are fallen.\u201d Arel hissed as the sharp sound of an alarm pierced the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Niko was already headed into the living room, moving to stand directly in front of the line of monitors.</p><p>\u201cSomeone just broke the perimeter.\u201d</p><p>The men frowned in unison as they studied the thick woods that surrounded the house.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Arel muttered as Niko manipulated the cameras to do a complete scan of the area. \u201cNot even a stray dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be Dylan,\u201d Niko ground out.</p><p>What the hell was she doing? She had to sense that Arel was in the house. There was no way she could hope to overpower two Sentinels.</p><p>Not without help.</p><p>\u201cOr a distraction,\u201d Arel stated the obvious. \u201cYou stay here and I\u2019ll try to flush her out.\u201d</p><p>Niko nodded in agreement. As much as he wanted to be on the hunt, his heart was firmly committed to protecting Angela.</p><p>Of course, that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t worried about his friend.</p><p>\u201cArel,\u201d he called as the younger man opened the door and stepped onto the front porch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Arel called, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p>Niko moved to shut the door and reset the alarm, then headed to the back of the house to check the locks. Stepping into the kitchen his instincts were on full alert.</p><p>Dylan.</p> <p>The scent of her filled the air.</p><p>On cue, the slender female still dressed in black stepped out of the pantry and offered him a mocking smile.</p><p>\u201cAbout time,\u201d she drawled. \u201cI thought Arel would never leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan.\u201d He clenched his hands at his side. His weapons were upstairs, but it didn\u2019t matter. He could kill as easily with his hands. Or even a well-placed kick. \u201cHow did you get past the security system?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glowed with an eerie crimson heat as she strolled forward, one hand held behind her back.</p> <p>A hidden weapon?</p><p>That was the most logical guess, although he couldn\u2019t catch the scent of gunpowder or the metallic tang of a blade.</p><p>He would no doubt find out soon enough, he conceded with an explosion of frustration.</p><p>Goddammit.</p><p>Why the hell couldn\u2019t this female simply accept that she was made precisely as nature had intended? She was graceful, strong, intensely intelligent and beautiful in an exotic fashion.</p><p>Everything most women wanted to be.</p> <p>\u201cI was watching the property when dear Arel was kind enough to punch in the codes so I didn\u2019t have to waste time trying to sneak past the cameras,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>Fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the alarm that just went off?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI set it off with a delayed explosion.\u201d</p><p>Ah. Of course.</p><p>\u201cClever, but a waste of your time,\u201d he said, his voice steady and his expression carefully devoid of his seething fury.</p><p>She strolled forward, a smirk curling her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for us to be enemies, Niko. Give me the female and I\u2019ll walk away. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe female\u2019s name is Angela,\u201d he said from between clenched teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>He shifted, making sure he was standing between the crazed bitch and the door.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do any good. She can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness flared in the crimson eyes. \u201cOh, I think you would be surprised what people can accomplish when they\u2019re desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve proven,\u201d he pointedly reminded her, his acute hearing picking up the sound of the shower being shut off overhead. Oh. Christ. Don\u2019t come down here, Angela. \u201cYou betrayed and murdered your own family. And for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a life beyond the prison walls.\u201d</p><p>His brows snapped together. \u201cValhalla has never been a prison.\u201d</p><p>She hissed in anger. \u201cNot to you.\u201d</p><p>Niko shook his head. He was wasting his breath. Dylan had convinced herself that her life had been some sort of torture at Valhalla. How else could she excuse the murder of those who\u2019d offered her only kindness?</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe if you can pass as a normal human your life will be filled with endless happiness?\u201d he instead sneered.</p><p>Her chin tilted, the slits of her flat nose flaring in anger.</p><p>\u201cEndless happiness? No. But fleeting happiness? Maybe,\u201d she ground out, taking another step closer. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I have the opportunity to fall in love? To have children.\u201d</p><p>He barely listened to her whining. He could smell . . . what? Something he couldn\u2019t identify.</p><p>Which was worrying the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cIf a man loves you he doesn\u2019t care about your appearance,\u201d he said in absent tones.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult me,\u201d she snarled. \u201cWould you be bedding your scientist if she looked like a monster?\u201d</p><p>Niko didn\u2019t even have to consider. \u201cHer looks have nothing to do with my feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Niko narrowed his gaze. \u201cBelieve what you want, Dylan, but be very clear on one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you if you lay a hand on Angela.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile of anticipation curled Dylan\u2019s lips as he widened his stance and squared his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo at last we get to discover who the better Sentinel is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing the superior fighter doesn\u2019t make you the better Sentinel,\u201d he reminded her, his attention torn between the threat standing in front of him and the nagging fear that Angela would return to the kitchen before he could disable Dylan. The last thing he needed was her leaping into the fray. And she would leap. He didn\u2019t have one damned doubt about that. \u201cOr didn\u2019t you learn anything in our training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean all that shit about loyalty and honor and protecting the weak?\u201d she mocked. \u201cBlah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky Wolfe never heard you call his teaching shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a warrior not a fucking Girl Scout.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. No argument there.</p><p>The mere thought of Dylan as a Girl Scout made him shudder in horror.</p><p>\u201cWith power comes responsibility.\u201d He repeated the words that had been drilled into his head from the minute he\u2019d walked into Valhalla.</p><p>Dylan gave a sharp laugh, pulling her hand from behind her back to reveal the small device that was strapped around her forearm.</p><p>\u201cAnd your insistence on clinging to honor will make sure I win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dylan,\u201d Niko breathed, recognizing the weapon that had been developed as an advanced stun gun only to be banned when it was discovered the electrical charge was enough to stop all but the strongest heart. \u201cWhere the hell did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it.\u201d She lifted her arm toward Niko. \u201cWe all have our little talents.\u201d</p><p>Niko darted to the side, acutely aware that it was a fifty-fifty shot of whether he could survive. If he died, or was even incapacitated, Angela would be at the mercy of the crazed Dylan.</p><p>As fast as he was, however, he wasn\u2019t fast enough.</p><p>Even as he moved he felt the barbs pierce the skin on his back, a massive jolt of electricity blasting through his body.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>With his last coherent thought, he tried to send a mental message to Arel and warn him of the danger. Then, as his heart threatened to explode, he dropped to the floor, his head banging against the ceramic tiles with enough force to knock him unconscious.</p><p>Angela stayed in the shower until the water turned cold and her skin was pruny. She wanted to give Niko and Arel plenty of privacy to talk.</p><p>Or argue.</p><p>Or have a beer and play lawn darts.</p><p>You could never be certain with men.</p><p>She blow-dried her hair and then slipped on the one pair of clean jeans she\u2019d managed to stuff into her bag along with a stretchy top.</p><p>She was searching for her shoes that had become lost during the heat of Niko\u2019s lovemaking when she heard a low grunt of pain.</p><p>Had that come from the kitchen?</p><p>Had the two men come to blows?</p><p>Well, she\u2019d be damned if she would stand aside and allow them to beat each other bloody. Especially if they were fighting about her.</p><p>Taking the steps two at a time, Angela jogged into the kitchen, not sure what to expect.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have enough experience with men to know if they could punch one another and then make up and play nice. Or if she\u2019d have to get between the two and try to make them stop.</p><p>Yeah, like she could actually separate two Sentinels.</p><p>Her ridiculous imaginings were destroyed by the sight of Niko lying motionless on the floor with Dylan standing next to him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Skidding to a halt, she sucked in a horrified breath, her heart forgetting to beat. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>Dylan lifted her head, her crimson eyes shimmering in the overhead light.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive, at least for now,\u201d she purred, her fingers lightly stroking over a strange device strapped to her forearm. \u201cCome with me without a fight and he\u2019ll stay that way. Otherwise poor Niko will join his beloved Fiona in the grave.\u201d</p><p>Angela nearly went to her knees at the tidal wave of relief that flowed through her.</p><p>Niko was alive.</p><p>That\u2019s all that mattered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d she croaked. \u201cJust leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>Stepping over the unconscious man, Dylan moved toward Angela with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d be reasonable once you understood the situation.\u201d</p><p>A blast of anger shook through Angela. This female had murdered over a dozen innocents, not to mention members of her own family, for her own selfish desires. Now she threatened to kill the man Angela loved\u2014yes, loved\u2014to force Angela to perform a miracle.</p><p>If she truly could alter cells, she\u2019d turn the bitch into a newt.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you\u2019re a psycho,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cCareful, scientist,\u201d Dylan hissed. \u201cMy temper isn\u2019t always stable and I might break your neck before I remember that I need you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an empty threat. Angela could see the barely leashed desire for violence shimmering in the crimson eyes.</p><p>With a shudder, she struggled to form a coherent thought through the fog of anger and sheer terror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Niko was unconscious, but where was Arel? Had he already left? Or was he lurking close enough he could come to the rescue?</p><p>Licking her dry lips, Angela glanced down at her bare feet. \u201cI need to get my shoes before we leave. Oh, and my purse. They\u2019re upstairs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to stall,\u201d Dylan interrupted with sharp impatience. \u201cArel is still searching the woods for me. We\u2019ll be long gone before he realizes he\u2019s been outmaneuvered.\u201d Her lips twisted with smug amusement. \u201cPoor schmuck.\u201d She gave a jerk of her head toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart sank. It seemed she was on her own.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Niko?\u201d Angela glanced toward Niko\u2019s face, which was unnaturally pale. What the hell had this woman done to him? \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him here. He needs a doctor.\u201d</p><p>Dylan shrugged. \u201cHe should wake in an hour or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould?\u201d</p><p>Dylan ran a loving finger over the strange contraption on her forearm.</p> <p>It was obviously a weapon, although Angela had never seen anything like it.</p><p>\u201cThis is more or less a prototype. I can\u2019t be sure of the lingering effects,\u201d Dylan revealed, her glance deliberately shifting toward Niko. \u201cNow walk or I\u2019ll shoot him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Angela breathed too low to be heard, grudgingly turning to walk out the back door.</p><p>At least Arel was near, she tried to reassure herself. He would make sure that Niko was given the medical attention he needed.</p><p>And as for her . . . well, what was destined to happen would happen.</p><p>As the resigned thought flared through her mind, Dylan moved to her side, grabbing her upper arm in a ruthless grip. Then, with an obvious lack of concern for the fact that Angela was incapable of seeing in the dark, the Sentinel hauled her away from the manicured lawn to the surrounding trees.</p> <p>Stumbling forward, Angela was kept upright by the silent female who prowled through the thick underbrush with an eerie grace.</p><p>Not that she appreciated the assistance. The rough jerks on her arm sent jagged bursts of pain through her shoulder and her bare feet were being shredded by the fast pace over the small rocks and thorn bushes.</p><p>At last they reached a small lake nestled among the trees that no doubt looked picturesque during the daylight, but at night reminded Angela of something out of a Friday the 13th movie.</p><p>An image that was only reinforced when they reached a car that was hidden among the shrubs and Dylan shoved her into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hands,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>Angela hesitated, then held out her hands. Why bother fighting the inevitable?</p><p>Reaching behind her back, Dylan pulled out a pair of zip cuffs and bound Angela\u2019s wrists together.</p><p>\u201cOw,\u201d Angela protested as the plastic cut into her skin. \u201cDo they have to be so tight?\u201d</p> <p>Dylan hissed in annoyance, twisting so she could reach into the front seat.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to do this.\u201d</p><p>Angela pressed herself back into the cushion as Dylan turned back with a roll of duct tape.</p><p>Christ, did the woman always drive around with all the tools necessary for a successful kidnapping?</p><p>\u201cNo. Please,\u201d Angela pleaded. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Sentinel ripped off a piece of the tape and slapped it across Angela\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Obviously satisfied that Angela was properly cowed, Dylan slammed shut the door and rounded the car to climb behind the steering wheel. She started the engine and set the car in motion, darting through the trees with a speed that would have made Angela screech in terror if she hadn\u2019t had so many other things on her list of worries.</p><p>Somehow in the whole scheme of her current life, being smashed into a tree at this point didn\u2019t seem so bad.</p><p>Eventually they hit a narrow dirt road and crashing through the gate that marked the edge of the property, Dylan shoved the gas pedal to the floor and sent them hurtling down the road with bone-jarring speed.</p><p>Angela struggled to stay upright, more than once hitting her head against the window as Dylan took a corner or hit a pothole. She lost track of time, but she sensed they were traveling east of Columbia.</p><p>Not that it mattered . . .</p><p>This time no one was going to be making a perfectly timed appearance to save her from the crazy freak. What difference did it make where she was killed and her body dumped?</p><p>Drowning in her dark thoughts, Angela barely noticed when the car came to a halt. It wasn\u2019t until the car door was opened and Dylan was hauling her out of the backseat that she came back to her senses.</p><p>And immediately wished that she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Not only was her entire body one big cramp, but there was a stench of garbage and something that she couldn\u2019t quite identify wafting in the air.</p><p>Meth?</p><p>With casual indifference to the pain she might cause, Dylan ripped the duct tape off Angela\u2019s mouth, her expression hard with warning.</p><p>\u201cYou can scream if you want,\u201d she said, gesturing toward the filthy trailer park that was filled with a half dozen shabby trailers. \u201cNo one around here gives a shit.\u201d</p><p>Angela believed her.</p><p>The very air reeked of a grinding poverty that would steal the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to be stuck in the barely habitable structures. They were far too busy trying to survive in a world that threatened to crush them to worry about anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you brought me here,\u201d she muttered as Dylan forced her up the stairs of the nearest trailer. \u201cI told you, I can\u2019t do what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Dylan efficiently dealt with the complicated lock before swinging the door open and shoving Angela inside. \u201cIt\u2019s all about focus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Angela\u2019s protest died on her lips as she tripped over the threshold to discover a small living room that had been scrubbed clean and stripped of most of its furniture except for a table that was nearly hidden beneath a stack of scientific equipment. \u201cAre those mine?\u201d she demanded in shock.</p><p>Dylan shoved her forward so she could enter the room and shut the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve convinced yourself you need technology to work your magic, so here it is.\u201d</p><p>Angela scowled at the persistent implication she was a fellow freak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not magic. And this equipment is only for my personal use. I would have to be in a fully functioning lab to try and complete my research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do it here.\u201d Removing her gloves, Dylan used a claw to slice through the cuffs that were shutting off the blood supply to Angela\u2019s hands and pushed her toward the table. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll do it now.\u201d</p><p>Managing to stay upright, Angela rubbed her sore wrists and pretended to study the equipment.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t argue with a crazy person.</p><p>Besides, it gave her the opportunity to covertly survey her surroundings.</p><p>To the right was an open kitchen with the standard stove, fridge, and microwave framed by cheap cabinets. There was a window over the sink, but it was too small for her to wriggle through.</p><p>To her left a doorway led to the back of the trailer, but the lights were out and it was too dark for her to make out more than a narrow hallway.</p><p>Directly opposite her was a pair of windows, covered by hideous paisley curtains. They had potential as an escape route, she decided. Always assuming she could somehow distract her dangerous captor long enough to attempt an escape.</p><p>Sensing Dylan\u2019s growing impatience, Angela sucked in a deep breath and turned her head to meet the crimson gaze.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll need to start with a blood sample.\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel strolled forward, offering Angela a sneer as she reached for one of the unused slides. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t trust you, but I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Using her claw, she poked the end of her finger and smeared the drop of blood on the slide. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Angela took the slide and grudgingly headed for the table.</p><p>It was ironic, really.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a scientist alive who wouldn\u2019t sell their soul for a glimpse at this rare blood. Some would even be willingly kidnapped (okay, that was an oxymoron) for the privilege.</p><p>But Angela would have traded the opportunity in a heartbeat if it meant being safely tucked in Niko\u2019s arms.</p><p>Turning on the microscope, she settled on the lone stool in the room and adjusted the settings, unnervingly aware of Dylan\u2019s impatient stare.</p><p>On the wall a clock ticked and more distantly a dog barked, but what felt like a threatening silence was wrapping around Angela, making it almost impossible to concentrate.</p><p>At last she had to do something, anything to slice through the thick air.</p><p>\u201cHow did you learn about me?\u201d She glanced up to see a puzzled expression on Dylan\u2019s exotic face. \u201cI mean, none of my work has been published yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Dylan shrugged. \u201cYour professor contacted Calder when it became obvious you were more than just another grad student.\u201d</p><p>Angela froze, not certain what part of the explanation bothered her the most.</p><p>\u201cWhich professor?\u201d she finally managed to croak.</p><p>\u201cI think his name was Appold.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fact that the woman knew the name of the professor who\u2019d taken Angela under his wing and had become a trusted mentor shook Angela more than she cared to admit.</p><p>Could it be true?</p><p>God almighty.</p> <p>Was her growing skill at manipulating cells actually a result of some mutation?</p><p>The thought was almost too overwhelming to even contemplate.</p><p>Not because she was prejudiced against high-bloods. Or even horrified at the thought of becoming one of them.</p><p>It was quite simply impossible to spend twenty-six years of her life believing herself to be one thing, and then in the space of one day being forced to accept she was another.</p><p>She was a logical, pedantic type of gal.</p> <p>She needed time to process the data.</p><p>Clearing the lump lodged in her throat, she wiped her damp hands on her jeans.</p><p>\u201cWho is Calder?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Master of Gifts,\u201d Dylan readily explained. \u201cHis order is in charge of seeking out high-bloods who either don\u2019t know they\u2019re special or those who are trying to blend in among the norms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he knows my professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s one of Calder\u2019s order who keeps his eyes open for high-bloods in this area.\u201d</p> <p>She briefly wondered why Appold hadn\u2019t told her of his suspicions from the beginning. Had he intended to spring the good news on her along with her diploma?</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your doctorate, Angela, oh, and by the way, you\u2019re a freak. . . .\u201d</p><p>She thrust away the futile thought.</p><p>She was more interested in the future. Hey, there was a minuscule chance that she might survive the night. She needed to be prepared.</p><p>\u201cDo they force all high-bloods to Valhalla?\u201d</p><p>Dylan\u2019s humorless laugh echoed through the empty trailer. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that they strongly encourage people to travel to the mother ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need to know if you are going to be a danger to yourself or others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Angela slowly nodded. \u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic,\u201d her companion mocked. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve shared our little heart-to-heart, will you get to work?\u201d</p><p>She heaved a sigh, knowing she\u2019d put off the inevitable for as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m warning you . . .\u201d</p><p>Her words came to a stuttering halt as she glanced into the microscope and actually concentrated on the blood sample.</p><p>\u201cGood . . . Lord.\u201d</p><p>Dylan moved to stand at her side. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen cells like this,\u201d she muttered, distracted in spite of herself. \u201cFascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be fascinating,\u201d Dylan snapped. \u201cI want to be normal.\u201d</p><p>Angela lifted her head to watch Dylan\u2019s expression harden with bitter self-hatred.</p><p>\u201cYou know that none of us are normal?\u201d She tried to squash the woman\u2019s expectations. Every woman wanted to look like Megan Fox, but the reality was that fate was rarely that kind. \u201cThere are differences in all of us, some are just greater than others.\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes flared with fury. \u201cI don\u2019t need a lesson in biology, I need a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>A claw pressed to her throat, bringing her words to a sharp halt.</p><p>\u201cLet me make this simple, scientist,\u201d she snarled in lethally soft tones. \u201cDo it or die.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time that Niko had stared death in the face.</p><p>Years before he\u2019d fought off a group of morons who were in the process of lynching a young female psychic who\u2019d been trying to make a living as a traveling gypsy.</p><p>Another time he was tracking a witch who was convinced she was destined to trigger doomsday and got caught in her lethal spell.</p><p>But he\u2019d never teetered so close to the edge.</p><p>And certainly he\u2019d never debated whether it would be preferable to battle through the pain so he could live. Or simply slip into the waiting darkness.</p><p>It was the image of dark, serious eyes and a lush, feminine mouth that had driven him to madness only hours before that gave him the grim determination to crawl back from the abyss. And, of course, the persistent sound of his name being shouted in his ear.</p><p>Scowling in annoyance, he forced open his heavy lids, not at all surprised to discover his fellow Sentinel crouched beside him with a worried expression.</p><p>\u201cArel?\u201d he managed to croak.</p><p>Fierce relief flared through the golden eyes. \u201cWelcome back, Sleeping Beauty.\u201d</p><p>Pressing a hand to his aching head, Niko struggled to a sitting position. Shit. He was as weak as a kitten.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell am I lying on the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good question.\u201d Arel\u2019s gaze was watchful, no doubt assessing whether he needed to call for a healer. \u201cI\u2019m assuming it has something to do with Dylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDylan.\u201d The memory of the crimson-eyed bitch who\u2019d tried to crispy-fry him seared through his mind. \u201cShe was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got that,\u201d Arel growled, his fury barely leashed. \u201cWhat did she do to you?\u201d</p><p>Even though his mind was fuzzy, Niko had a vivid recollection of the pain that had halted his heart.</p><p>\u201cShe shot me with a shockwave.\u201d</p><p>Arel frowned. \u201cI thought they\u2019d all been confiscated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe claims that she built her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she did.\u201d Arel curled his lips in disgust. They\u2019d all known Dylan spent her free time tinkering with her inventions. A pity they hadn\u2019t kept a closer eye on just what she was building. \u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Slowly gathering his wits, Niko glanced around the empty kitchen, his abused heart slamming against his ribs.</p><p>\u201cAngela?\u201d</p><p>Arel grimaced. \u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d</p><p>Niko surged to his feet only to lurch forward as his legs refused to cooperate. Thankfully, Arel was swiftly rising to catch him before he could do a face-plant.</p><p>\u201cBefore you have a meltdown, I can track them,\u201d Arel hastily assured him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt your skill, amigo, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not about skill,\u201d Arel interrupted, making sure that Niko could stand on his own before he stepped back and pulled a phone from his pocket. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Niko blinked to clear his bleary gaze, then focused on the road map that was visible on the phone screen. Leaning closer, he noticed the tiny light that was blinking.</p><p>GPS.</p><p>And if he knew Arel, then the blinking red dot was Dylan.</p><p>\u201cYou tagged her?\u201d he demanded, afraid to hope.</p><p>Arel smiled with grim satisfaction. \u201cI set a trigger on the back porch before I came in. As soon as Dylan opened the door it attached itself to her shoe.\u201d</p><p>Niko released a shaky sigh despite the cold chill that inched down his spine at the realization of how easy it would have been for Dylan to disappear with Angela while he was unconscious.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she hadn\u2019t come through the back door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have set a few others,\u201d Arel admitted. \u201cYou know me. Better safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Niko snorted. \u201cSafe?\u201d</p><p>Arel gave a casual lift of his shoulder. \u201cOkay, call it overkill.\u201d</p><p>Overkill. Yeah. That was definitely more Arel\u2019s style.</p><p>\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least half an hour.\u201d</p><p>Niko growled in frustration. Dylan might need Angela alive and relatively unharmed if she was to get what she so desperately wanted, but that was no guarantee of her safety. The female Sentinel was as volatile as she was unstable.</p><p>A lethal combination.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>Arel moved to block his stumbling path toward the door. \u201cDammit, Niko, you can barely stand.\u201d</p><p>Niko glared at his friend. \u201cDon\u2019t even start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sensible. I could travel faster without you.\u201d</p><p>Niko was shaking his head before Arel finished. \u201cThis is an argument you\u2019re not going to win, so give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStubborn bastard.\u201d</p><p>Moving like a drunken sailor, Niko sidestepped Arel and continued across the room and out the back door. He\u2019d made it past the pool when Arel caught up with him. Offering Niko a frustrated scowl, the younger Sentinel led him to the garage where he\u2019d hidden his vehicle.</p><p>Niko lurched into the garage, giving a lift of his brows at the sight of the large four-wheel drive pickup with massive tires that looked like they should have been on a tank.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he muttered, struggling to lift his foot high enough to reach the running board. \u201cOvercompensating for anything, amigo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just like power,\u201d Arel said, giving Niko a shove in the ass to get him up and in the passenger seat.</p><p>Slamming shut the door, Niko waited for his companion to swing behind the driver\u2019s wheel and start the engine.</p><p>\u201cIf you say so,\u201d he mocked at the throaty roar that filled the air.</p><p>Arel shot him a jaundiced glare, pausing to attach his phone to a mount on the dashboard before backing out of the garage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not in any condition to question my manhood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich is the only reason I\u2019m questioning it now,\u201d Niko confessed, leaning his throbbing head against the seat. \u201cYou can\u2019t kick my ass when I\u2019m hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it.\u201d With an evil grin, Arel shoved the truck in gear and took off like a bat out of hell. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Niko braced his hands against the glove compartment, clenching his teeth as the truck swerved around a corner and bounced across a shallow ditch to head straight across an empty field. \u201cIs there something wrong with the road?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Arel muttered, his gaze shifting between the dark field and the map on his phone.</p><p>Niko bit his tongue, closing his eyes so he could try and concentrate on recuperating his strength. Dylan had clearly gone over the edge. There was no reasoning, no hope of compromise with the female.</p><p>This was going to be a fight to the death.</p><p>He managed to maintain his silence until Arel rammed through a fence at a hundred miles an hour and nearly sent them into the lake.</p><p>No one was more anxious than he was to get to Angela. No one. But he was just beginning to shake off the effects of the shockwave. He couldn\u2019t afford to be injured before he even reached Dylan.</p> <p>\u201cI could drive,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Arel slowed as they neared the signal still blinking on the GPS.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone told you that you have control issues?\u201d</p><p>Always.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he lied as Arel pulled the truck to a halt just outside a trailer park.</p><p>\u201cDylan\u2019s close,\u201d Arel murmured, his nose wrinkling at the stench of garbage and human misery. \u201cDamn. Why here?\u201d</p> <p>Niko allowed his gaze to search the heavy shadows that shrouded the park, briefly puzzled by the tug of awareness that flowed through him.</p><p>Was this a new trick of Dylan\u2019s?</p><p>Then, as the sensation settled deep in his heart, he realized this was no trick.</p><p>And it had nothing to do with Dylan.</p><p>\u201cNiko?\u201d</p><p>Belatedly realizing that Arel was studying him with a worried gaze, Niko returned his attention to their grim surroundings.</p><p>\u201cIf she intended to have a hostage she would want to be isolated from nosy neighbors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Arel pointed across the narrow parking lot. \u201cThere\u2019s her car. Stay here and I\u2019ll find out which trailer she\u2019s in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Niko nodded toward the trailer set a short distance from the others. \u201cIt\u2019s that one.\u201d</p><p>Arel turned to frown at him. \u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d</p><p>Niko pressed a hand to the center of his chest. \u201cI can feel Angela.\u201d</p><p>Arel\u2019s golden eyes widened in shock.</p><p>On very rare occasions a high-blood could be so deeply connected to another that they formed a bond that could be felt on a physical level.</p><p>Niko had always pitied the poor schmucks who allowed themselves to be melded. Why would anyone want to be leashed for their entire lives?</p><p>It was . . . abnormal.</p><p>Now, he accepted he hadn\u2019t known a damned thing.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a leash, and it certainly wasn\u2019t abnormal.</p><p>It was as perfect and natural as breathing.</p><p>Angela completed him.</p><p>Yeah, yeah. It was sappy. But that\u2019s exactly how he felt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone that far?\u201d Arel growled, not nearly as pleased as Niko by the unexpected gift.</p><p>Niko smiled, shoving open the door of the truck so he could jump out to stand on the dirt path.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>Arel cursed, hurriedly moving to stand at Niko\u2019s side. \u201cYou still need to stay here while I scout out the best way to stage an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no strategy.\u201d His gaze searched the trailer for any hidden traps. \u201cI\u2019ll go in the front door and while Dylan is distracted you\u2019ll go in from the back and rescue Angela.\u201d</p><p>In less than a heartbeat Arel was standing directly in front of him, his hands planted on his hips and his expression set in stubborn lines.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Niko narrowed his gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pull rank, but I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer in charge of this mission,\u201d Arel reminded him in sharp tones. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking back command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Niko. You\u2019re not thinking clearly.\u201d</p><p>Niko refused to back down. \u201cI\u2019m thinking clearly enough to know I\u2019m going to kill that bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Arel snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell you could survive another hit from her weapon.\u201d</p><p>Niko couldn\u2019t deny the blunt truth. It\u2019d been a miracle that his heart had restarted after the first shock. The chance it could endure another blast . . . it was pretty much zero to none.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t change a damned thing.</p><p>He was going to do whatever it took to get Angela out of that trailer safe and sound.</p><p>Whatever it took.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared this time,\u201d he tried to reassure his companion. \u201cShe won\u2019t have a chance to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiko\u2014\u201d</p><p>Growingly anxious to reach Angela, Niko didn\u2019t wait to hear Arel\u2019s arguments. He understood his friend\u2019s concerns. Hell, he even agreed with them.</p><p>He was emotionally compromised and physically weakened. But none of that mattered.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this thing,\u201d he said, heading directly toward the trailer.</p><p>Dylan would sense his approach before he could reach the door. There was no point in being subtle.</p><p>Besides, he wanted the bitch focused on him. That was the only way Arel would be able to slip in unnoticed.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit.\u201d Arel moved to walk beside him. \u201cIf you get yourself killed I swear I\u2019ll drag your sorry ass back from the grave.\u201d</p><p>Niko grimaced. \u201cNot even a necro can perform that miracle.\u201d</p><p>Necromancers\u2014or diviners\u2014couldn\u2019t actually manipulate the dead, although they were capable of entering the recently deceased\u2019s minds to view their last thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll travel to hell myself if I have to,\u201d Arel muttered.</p><p>Niko turned to meet his friend\u2019s worried gaze. \u201cJust promise me that you\u2019ll make sure Angela is safe, no matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>The lean face tightened, as if Arel was struggling against the urge to continue his futile argument. Then, heaving a sigh of resignation, he clapped Niko on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know you don\u2019t even have to ask, amigo. I\u2019ve always considered you my brother. How could I treat your woman as anything less than my sister?\u201d</p><p>It was exactly what he\u2019d expected, but he needed to hear the words spoken out loud.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He returned his attention to the trailer. \u201cNow go.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until Arel had jogged to the back of the lot, Niko stepped onto the pavement that marked the edge of the park, a humorless smile curling his lips as the door to the trailer was thrown open and Dylan confronted him with an infuriated scowl.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you find me?\u201d she snarled.</p><p>Niko hid his shudder of relief as he caught Angela\u2019s scent. He could smell her terror. It spiced the air. But on the plus side her heart was still beating and there was no hint of blood.</p><p>Thank the gods.</p><p>\u201cAh, Dylan.\u201d He forced a mocking smile to his lips. \u201cLong time, no see.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glowed like pits of hell in the moonlight. \u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>He halted several feet away, but Dylan remained firmly lodged in the doorway. Dammit. He needed to lure her away from the trailer. Something easier said than done.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that I\u2019m the better Sentinel?\u201d He deliberately prodded her pride. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you go or how hard you try to hide, I will always find you.\u201d</p><p>She stroked her fingers over the weapon still strapped around her forearm.</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool me once, shame on you.\u201d He curled his forefinger in invitation. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to come out and play?\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the doorjamb. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo well trained to fall for such an obvious trap.\u201d She sniffed the air. \u201cWhere is Arel? Trying to sneak in the back door?\u201d</p><p>Niko\u2019s smile never faltered despite his stab of fear. The bitch was supposed to be attacking him, not remaining lodged in the trailer like a rabid guard dog.</p><p>So how did he convince her that she had no choice but to fight?</p><p>By proving that the risk of leaving Arel and me alive is too great . . .</p><p>The thought seared through his mind at the same time he was struck by inspiration.</p><p>There was only one thing that Dylan feared.</p><p>And that was losing her one chance to be made normal.</p><p>She had to believe her dreams were about to be shattered.</p><p>Niko folded his arms across his chest, trying to look nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure you didn\u2019t slip away before we could finish this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d Dylan flared her flat nose in what he assumed was disdain. \u201cOr your devoted sycophant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cArel isn\u2019t going to be happy to be called a sycophant,\u201d he drawled. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re scared or not. All I need to do is keep you cornered until the cavalry rides to the rescue.\u201d</p><p>She pretended indifference, but Niko didn\u2019t miss the sudden tension that gripped her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cArel contacted Wolfe when he found me unconscious,\u201d he smoothly lied, betting on the fact this female wouldn\u2019t have any inside connections left at Valhalla. One phone call and his fib would blow up in his face. \u201cThe Tagos wasn\u2019t pleased to discover you\u2019re carrying around an illegal weapon, let alone kidnapping a scientist who they hope will be the salvation of those high-bloods who can\u2019t survive their mutations.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was strained. \u201cI suppose you want me to believe he\u2019s sending a hundred\u2014oh wait, maybe it\u2019s a thousand\u2014warriors to capture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue, but since the guardians can only transport two or three at a time, you won\u2019t have to worry about a thousand arriving on your doorstep.\u201d He waved a languid hand toward the empty road. \u201cAt least not in the next hour or so.\u201d</p><p>Dylan frowned, proving she hadn\u2019t had word that the guardians were refusing to leave their necros, and that there was no possibility of any backup arriving in time.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou won\u2019t ruin this for me. Not now.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled in open challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s no escape.\u201d</p><p>The crimson eyes at last smoldered with the panic he\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>Even a Sentinel made stupid decisions when driven by fear.</p><p>\u201cI can go through you,\u201d she rasped.</p><p>He held out his arms in mocking invitation. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p> <p>Lifting her arm she released a blast from her shockwave. Already anticipating the shot, Niko lunged to the side, allowing the electrical charge to slam into the tree behind him.</p><p>\u201cIs that all you got?\u201d he taunted, brushing off the bits of bark and shattered wood that clung to his jeans.</p><p>\u201cAnd the healers told me that I was the one with the death wish,\u201d Dylan snarled, leaping off the front steps of the trailer even as she was sending another invisible bolt of power in his direction.</p><p>He felt his hair rise as the electricity filled the air, his gaze trained on the female launching a kick at his head.</p><p>Distantly he was aware of the wary humans peeking out their windows and a few braver souls who stepped out of their shabby homes, but he didn\u2019t worry they would interfere.</p><p>Life was difficult enough for these norms. They didn\u2019t willingly place themselves in danger.</p><p>He was far more concerned by the barely audible sound of Arel\u2019s soft murmur as he spoke to Angela. No doubt he was trying to convince her to slip through the back door rather than charging into the fray. His scientist might be brilliant, but she could be as stubborn as hell.</p><p>Reassured by the sudden fading of her scent, Niko grasped Dylan\u2019s foot and twisted it to the side. The well-trained Sentinel flowed through the air, easily landing on her feet as she let off another shot.</p> <p>Niko hissed as the bolt went just above his ducked head, close enough to make his ears ring.</p><p>Christ. He had to disable the shockwave. Sooner or later he was going to run out of luck. And then . . .</p><p>Bad, bad things were going to happen.</p><p>Avoiding a punch aimed at his chin, he charged forward, ramming his larger form into Dylan\u2019s slender body. Together they hit the ground with enough impact to rattle Niko\u2019s teeth and knock the air from his lungs.</p><p>She jerked her head backward, making him see stars as she connected with his chin. Then, when he maintained his grim hold, she turned her head to sink her sharp teeth into his forearm.</p><p>\u201cShit, Dylan,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He ignored the pain of his torn flesh. \u201cNot a chance in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll both die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in no position to threaten\u2014\u201d He forgot what he was going to say as she twisted to the side, managing to lift her arm far enough to press a button on her homemade weapon. A clock appeared on a digital panel, the numbers counting backward. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery evil villain has a way to self-destruct,\u201d she jeered. \u201cUnless you release me then we both go boom.\u201d</p><p>He believed her.</p><p>Dylan might be crazy as a hatter, but she didn\u2019t bluff.</p><p>If she said the thing was going to self-destruct, then that\u2019s exactly what it was going to do.</p><p>The question was whether he held on or risked letting her go so she could disarm the weapon. He wasn\u2019t a martyr. Not by a long shot, but he knew if he let go of Dylan there was no guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t escape. Or even manage to kill him with her stun-gun-from-hell.</p><p>Hearing the sound of his name, he lifted his head to see Arel standing at the back of the trailer with a struggling Angela in his arms.</p><p>She was clearly trying to break free so she could get to him, even knowing she was no match for a Sentinel.</p><p>And in that moment his decision was made.</p><p>The fragile, precious female would never be safe so long as Dylan lived.</p><p>And if that meant he had to sacrifice himself in the bargain . . . then it was a price he would pay without regret.</p><p>\u201cThen we both die,\u201d he said, his gaze glued on Angela as time ran out.</p><p>Angela hadn\u2019t wanted to sneak out the back door with Arel. Not when she heard Niko baiting the deranged female Sentinel.</p><p>The aggravating man was risking his own life so she could be rescued.</p><p>But Arel hadn\u2019t given her much choice as he\u2019d simply grabbed her by the waist and hauled her down the narrow hall and out the door. It wasn\u2019t until they rounded the trailer to see Niko on the ground with Dylan that Arel came to an abrupt halt, as transfixed as Angela by the sight of the two warriors lying so still.</p><p>Something was happening.</p><p>Something . . . terrible.</p><p>Futilely trying to squirm out of Arel\u2019s ruthless grasp, she turned her head to glare at her captor in frustration.</p><p>\u201cDammit, what are you doing? We have to help him.\u201d</p><p>Arel\u2019s handsome features looked as if they\u2019d been carved from granite. \u201cHe made me swear to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was still turned toward Arel when an explosion sent them both tumbling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Arel rasped, already on his feet and racing across the pavement before Angela managed to regain her senses.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>With her ears ringing and her skin raw from being peppered by the barrage of small stones and shattered glass that had been caught in the blast, she lurched upright, her blurry gaze immediately searching for Niko.</p><p>He was still on the ground, but Dylan\u2014or at least what was left of the female Sentinel\u2014had been blown several feet away. Arel was standing over her, his face twisted with an odd combination of fury and sorrow as he bent to pick up the weapon that lay beside her ruined body.</p><p>That bit of twisted metal had to have been the source of the explosion, but Angela didn\u2019t give a shit about the how or even the why.</p><p>She just needed to know that Niko was okay.</p><p>Falling to her knees at his side, she reached to brush her hand over his cheek.</p><p>\u201cNiko,\u201d she breathed, a savage pain clawing at her heart as she felt the heat rapidly draining from his skin.</p><p>Arel crossed to kneel next to her, the force of his anger a tangible sizzle in the air as he gently turned Niko onto his back to reveal the gaping wound that marred his chest.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn that bitch.\u201d</p><p>Angela\u2019s fingers frantically moved to Niko\u2019s throat. She was unable to look at his bloody, torn flesh.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find a pulse,\u201d she said on a soft sob. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>There was a long, agonizing hesitation before Arel awkwardly rose to his feet and pulled a phone from his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for a healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll never get here in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014\u201d Arel gave a helpless shake of his head. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Angela watched the younger Sentinel walk away with the phone pressed to his ear before she turned back to the terrifyingly motionless man lying at her knees.</p><p>\u201cOh, Niko. Don\u2019t you dare leave me,\u201d she quietly murmured, her hands running a path along the gruesome injury as she willed his shredded heart to beat. \u201cNot after you forced me out of my laboratory. And made me discover who I am.\u201d Her teardrops trailed down her cheek and dropped into Niko\u2019s tousled hair, shimmering in the copper highlights. Oh . . . God. He couldn\u2019t die. She wouldn\u2019t let him. \u201cAnd then you went and made me fall in love with you, you irritating man.\u201d There were more tears, and a strange heat that seemed to flow from her palms. She ignored both as she continued to pour out her raw, mindless grief. \u201cI can\u2019t do this alone. I need you.\u201d She lowered her head until her face was buried in his throat, drowning in his familiar scent. \u201cPlease, Niko, please.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long she knelt there, rubbing her hands over Niko\u2019s chest, but it was at last the feel of fingers lightly touching her shoulder that brought her back to her surroundings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngela,\u201d Arel murmured softly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela, look.\u201d</p> <p>Reluctantly she straightened, assuming that Arel was warning someone was approaching.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded when she realized the lot was empty.</p><p>With a bemused expression, he pointed toward her hands, which remained on Niko\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute to see through the tears, then slowly she focused on the torn flesh that had started to knit back together.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she breathed in shock. \u201cHe\u2019s healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re healing him,\u201d Arel insisted.</p><p>She froze at his astonishing claim. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a heartbeat.\u201d Arel\u2019s fingers tightened on her shoulder, his urgent tone sending a flare of hope through her heavy anguish. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNiko.\u201d Her hand resumed its soft strokes, her gaze glued to his face. Did he have more color than before? And was that a breath she heard? \u201cNiko, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>There was nothing for long, agonizing minutes. Then, when she was beginning to fear that her grief was making her imagination run wild, there was a flutter of his lashes.</p> <p>\u201cAngela?\u201d he croaked in husky tones.</p><p>She gave a choked cry, overwhelmed with relief. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Arel released a joyous laugh, his fingers giving her shoulder a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, you got something right, amigo,\u201d Niko whispered, his gaze trained on Angela\u2019s flushed face. \u201cShe is a miracle.

No one will ever force you to offer more than you\u2019re comfortable giving.\u201d Niko lifted a hand to brush away her tears. \u201cNow can we go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d She studied his beloved features, knowing he wasn\u2019t referring to her empty apartment. \u201cYou mean Valhalla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He managed a weak smile, his thumb tracing her lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019re one of us now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes shifted to the wound that was continuing to heal before returning to meet his steady gaze.</p><p>She was one of them.</p><p>A freak.</p><p>A high-blood.</p><p>A Sentinel\u2019s lover.</p><p>And nothing had ever made her happier.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she murmured, bending down to gently kiss the man who offered her a future she never dreamed possible. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home.\u201d</p><p>Hello Readers!</p><p>I hope you enjoyed Angela and Niko\u2019s story. This is a short introduction to my new series, The Sentinels. This series will revolve around people who are \u201cgifted\u201d with special abilities and the warriors who protect them. Next up is Duncan O\u2019Conner\u2019s story. He\u2019s a hard-nosed police detective who requests the services of Callie Brown, a high-blood necromancer, when a young woman is found murdered in her kitchen. Callie\u2019s skill allows her to view the last memories of the dead before the soul leaves the body. Most cops consider it a gruesome talent, but Duncan isn\u2019t so squeamish. Callie has managed to solve a dozen murders over the past five years. Besides, he can\u2019t deny a fascination with the beautiful high-blood. She stirs a passion in him that threatens to consume them both.</p><p>Coming in June 2013 will be Darkness Avenged, Santiago and Nefri\u2019s story. Can you believe this is the tenth book in the Guardians of Eternity series? I never imagined when I first came up with the idea of a clan of vampires in Chicago that it would grow and expand to include such a wide variety of creatures. Weres, witches, Sylvermyst, and of course, one naughty gargoyle. And it\u2019s all because of you!</p><p>So thank you dear readers, and happy reading!</p><p>Alexandra Ivy</p><p>TIES THAT BIND</p><p>NINA BANGS</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>A ticking clock.</p><p>The creaks and groans of an old building settling.</p><p>A print of Edvard Munch\u2019s The Scream hanging on a pale green wall.</p><p>They didn\u2019t mean much individually. But as Cassie sat alone in the office of Eternal Rest Funeral Home listening to the tick tocks, the creaks and groans, and staring at the print . . . She took a deep breath and prayed for human contact before she did her own interpretation of The Scream.</p><p>Those creaks and groans? Definitely sounds of the dead rising, shuffling across the floor in the basement, coming for her. The ticking clock counted down the minutes before the walking dead crashed through the office door and tore her into bite-size bits.</p><p>Cassie shivered. Why had she agreed to sub for Felicity for even three minutes let alone three hours? She hated funeral parlors, hated the concept of putting dead bodies on display, hated dead bodies. For twenty-seven years she\u2019d avoided going to a viewing\u2014as a child with tantrums and as an adult with polite refusals.</p><p>Now, because her best friend had plied her with sobs and a giant guilt trip, she was here, by herself\u2014not one other freaking person in the building except for dead guys\u2014in the office of Eternal Rest. And it was getting dark outside.</p><p>She should have stood firm against Felicity\u2019s begging. No one needed her here. She\u2019d only answered the phone once in the last two hours. Fifteen minutes ago a woman had called to ask about her husband\u2019s funeral. The woman had hung up with a huff of irritation when Cassie couldn\u2019t help her.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s heart did a giant ker-thump at the shrill sound of the doorbell. Get a grip. Zombies didn\u2019t ring the bell.</p><p>The back entrance, the one with the very large doors that opened to allow very large things\u2014definitely not thinking about what those were\u2014to be carried in and out. She took gulping breaths and tried to calm her primal fears. But that was the problem with primal fears\u2014they weren\u2019t rational, and she couldn\u2019t control them.</p><p>Cassie pushed to her feet and hurried toward\u2014thank God\u2014human interaction. As she yanked the doors open, and flipped on the outside light, she thought about shoving aside the man standing there and running like hell. Breathe, breathe. Fact: she could leave whenever she wanted. But then Mr. Garrity would fire Felicity. Fact: a live person stood not three feet from her. Her panic subsided.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d She smiled as she took inventory. He looked around forty with thinning hair and an ordinary face. Cassie felt the rest of her fear slide away.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Felicity?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound too surprised that she was gone. Did her friend make a habit of skipping out on her job? \u201cShe had an emergency. She\u2019ll be back in\u201d\u2014Cassie glanced at her watch\u2014\u201can hour.\u201d That\u2019s all Cassie had to last. Sixty more minutes.</p><p>Felicity owed her big-time for this. No explanation, just a frantic call. Panic had ridden her voice as she\u2019d begged Cassie to fill in for her. And no matter what, Mr. Garrity couldn\u2019t find out that she was gone. She\u2019d promised to leave the back door unlocked and then hung up.</p><p>Cassie had sat staring at the phone. What kind of emergency? It must\u2019ve been serious from the sound of her friend\u2019s voice. Her conscience pointed out that Felicity was allowing her to sleep in her spare room while Cassie searched for work. This small favor was the least she could do in return. Cassie wished her conscience would mind its own business. After about a half hour of mental hand-wringing, though, she\u2019d temporarily beaten her fears into submission and headed out to spend a few hours in her personal nightmare.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mr. Garrity know you\u2019re here?\u201d He speared her with a hard stare.</p><p>Cassie had to protect Felicity\u2019s job. She pasted on her most sincere expression. \u201cOf course.\u201d On the shades-of-gray scale, this lie was almost white. Her conscience subsided with a grumble.</p><p>The man nodded. \u201cI do special jobs for Mr. Garrity. When a client wants a picture hand-etched onto a headstone, I\u2019m the one who does it. Felicity probably told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d Felicity had told her nothing.</p><p>\u201cI delivered one here this morning, but I have to make some minor changes.\u201d</p><p>He held up a few pointy tools she hadn\u2019t noticed at first. She frowned. Why would he deliver the headstone here and not to the cemetery? \u201cSo you do custom work?\u201d That was her, the queen of obvious.</p><p>He smiled for the first time. \u201cEvery headstone is one of a kind. Why don\u2019t you get the keys to the basement rooms and meet me down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeys?\u201d She\u2019d seen the elevator doors in the hallway right behind her, but Cassie had tried not to think about what lay beneath her feet. Not too successfully if she was imagining zombie attacks.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped smiling. \u201cThe keys are in Felicity\u2019s desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Desk.\u201d Something didn\u2019t feel right. Cassie glanced past him to where he\u2019d parked his small, unmarked delivery truck. Another man was climbing from the passenger side of the truck. Now this guy was scary, and big, but he was human and alive. Both points in his favor. She dismissed her feelings. This whole place spooked her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first man nodded toward his friend. \u201cForgot to introduce myself. I\u2019m Tony and the big guy is Len. Takes size to handle the stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Cassie smiled at both men. No way was she giving her name. If the funeral director got cranky because Felicity had called in random secretarial help while he was gone, Cassie didn\u2019t want to be in the line of fire. \u201cAbout those keys. Why don\u2019t you wait here for a moment? I\u2019ll find them and bring them right back.\u201d She did not want to take that elevator anywhere.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t waste time waiting for you. I have someplace to be in twenty minutes. Besides, I might need your help.\u201d Tony held her gaze. \u201cOh, and make sure you press the bottom button.\u201d</p> <p>Help? For what? Musical accompaniment? He could hack away at his tombstone in time with her chattering teeth. But she couldn\u2019t think of an excuse that wouldn\u2019t make her look like the giant wuss she really was.</p><p>The two men walked past her, heading for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cOh, um, do you know where Mr. Garrity is?\u201d In fact, where anybody was? There hadn\u2019t been one person in the place when she\u2019d arrived. She refused to think about the non-living that probably populated the basement.</p><p>Len answered her. \u201cMr. Garrity was also called away on an . . . emergency.\u201d He seemed to think that was funny, because he smiled.</p><p>Cassie thought he had a sinister smile. Okay, maybe not. Her imagination was a terrible thing. Proof? Nonexistent zombies shambling down the hallway. To stop herself from babbling something that would get Felicity in trouble, she turned and walked back to the office.</p> <p>On the way there, it occurred to her that the men wouldn\u2019t save any time by making her bring the keys downstairs because they\u2019d still have to wait for her to unlock the door. She shrugged the thought away.</p><p>Keys, keys . . . She found them in the top drawer of the desk. That part had been easy. Now for the tough part. She had to go back to the elevator, walk inside, and hit the down button.</p><p>By the time she reached the elevator, she\u2019d almost made herself believe that this whole experience was a character-building event. She\u2019d be stronger for having spent time at Eternal Rest. You are such a liar.</p><p>Inside the car, she had a choice of three unlabeled buttons. The funeral home was only one story, so that meant ground level and two levels below ground. Weird. She hit the bottom one. All the way down she tried to convince her heart it didn\u2019t need to pump gallons of extra blood so she could handle a few minutes among the dead. Her heart didn\u2019t believe her. It redoubled its efforts.</p><p>The elevator doors slid open, and Cassie stepped out. She was in a long wide hallway with closed doors lining both sides. Was this usual for a funeral home? The lights were a little too dim, the shadows a little too deep. Relieved, she saw Tony and Len waiting for her at the end of the hall in front of the door on the right.</p><p>Please, no bodies, no bodies, no bodies. Her legs felt rubbery by the time she reached the men. They moved aside so she could open the door. She was proud that her hand didn\u2019t shake as she slipped the key labeled with the number eight into the lock and turned it. Cassie pushed the door open and then started to step aside.</p> <p>After that, things happened too fast for her to react. Tony reached into the room and flipped on a light at the same time someone gave her a hard shove. She stumbled into the room, tripped over something on the floor, and went down hard on her hands and knees. She heard the door slam shut behind her.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream. Then she looked down. The scream froze in her throat.</p><p>She was kneeling in a pool of blood\u2014</p><p>And staring into Felicity\u2019s sightless eyes.</p><p>Dead. Felicity was dead.</p><p>Cassie couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see her best friend sprawled on that floor, didn\u2019t see the girl she\u2019d shared notes with in school, the woman who\u2019d comforted her when she\u2019d lost her job. Cassie only saw\u2014</p><p>A dead body. She was kneeling next to a dead body. Whimpering, she scooted backward, still on her hands and knees. The blood smeared, sticky on her hands, soaking into her jeans.</p> <p>Never get it out, never get it out. Panicked, she knelt up and tried to wipe her hands on her top.</p><p>\u201cGee, looks like your friend had more of an emergency than she expected.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice.</p><p>His soft laughter jerked her back to some level of sanity. Scrambling to her feet, she whirled to face the two men standing in front of the only door.</p><p>She still couldn\u2019t force any sound from her locked throat muscles, clenched teeth. But she didn\u2019t need to, because Tony had plenty to say.</p><p>\u201cMr. Garrity got a call on his cell phone from a Mrs. Hodges. She was really upset that you couldn\u2019t help her when she called. Said the regular woman was a lot more efficient.\u201d He took a step toward her.</p><p>Cassie backed up a step, her eyes riveted on what he held in his hand. The long pointed tool now looked exactly like what it was\u2014a weapon.</p><p>\u201cThis really upset Mr. Garrity. See, no one should\u2019ve been here to answer any phones. And since he was tied up with his . . . emergency, he asked us to take care of the problem. Lucky that we live close by.\u201d</p><p>She was going to die. Just like Felicity. She\u2019d be lying in a pool of her own blood staring at the ceiling. Funny, the thought of dying didn\u2019t paralyze her with fear. It was just the bodies. It had always been the bodies.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She forced the one word past lips that felt numb. Not much, but it was at least a start. Don\u2019t look at the body, don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look.</p><p>Tony shrugged. \u201cNo need to know all the details. Besides, I was telling the truth about that appointment. Let\u2019s just say your friend found something she wasn\u2019t supposed to find and was running off to give it to someone we didn\u2019t want to have it. So we stopped her.\u201d He smiled. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to stop you.\u201d</p><p>She saw the intention in his eyes as he started toward her. Survive. That\u2019s all that mattered. Weapon. There had to be something. Panicked, she bumped into a table beside her. An empty glass sitting near the edge fell to the floor and shattered. Without thinking, she crouched and picked up the largest shard.</p><p>Len chuckled. \u201cLooks like the little girl thinks she can defend herself.\u201d</p><p>Tony wasn\u2019t laughing. He launched himself at her, ready to bury the tool\u2019s point in her heart. Then she\u2019d be just a body, a body, a . . .</p><p>No! Cassie reacted. Lessons learned from years of modern dance kicked in. She might not have the talent to be a professional dancer, but she knew the moves.</p><p>Leaping into the air, she spun away from Tony\u2019s charge. At the same time she slashed at him with her glass shard. She was too terrified to aim. But she\u2019d hurt him. She\u2019d felt the resistance of the glass digging into his flesh.</p><p>Sobbing, she whirled to fend off another charge. A charge that didn\u2019t come.</p><p>Silence filled the room. Then she heard Len cursing. Glancing down, she saw Tony sprawled on the floor. Saw the moment he died, his throat sliced open. Saw the blood pouring from the wound. The body. She dropped the bloodstained shard.</p><p>Nothing to protect yourself with now. The thought floated around in her mind, for the moment overwhelmed by the coppery scent of blood and the memory of the glass cutting, ripping, ending a life.</p><p>She supposed she was lucky then that Len didn\u2019t attack her right away. Forcing herself to think instead of just feel, she looked at him.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t watching her. He was staring past her at . . . She turned.</p><p>The horrors never ended. A transparent coffin rested on another table. A man\u2019s body lay inside. He was naked, and his pale skin gleamed under the ceiling light. Someone had set a headstone beside the table. Only two things about the stone registered.</p><p>A sick mind had created that image. It was an etching of the man in his coffin with thick chains wrapped around almost every inch of his body. A huge padlock trapped the man inside. The etched lock almost seemed to glow.</p><p>And a name. Ethan.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid bitch! You killed the binder.\u201d</p><p>Cassie had never heard that much fear in any person\u2019s voice. A binder? What was a\u2014</p><p>The man in the coffin turned his head. He opened his eyes and stared at her. Eyes with no pupils, no white, just solid black.</p><p>She stopped breathing.</p><p>Len screamed, a high keening sound filled with unspeakable terror. He threw himself toward the closed door.</p><p>The coffin shattered.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Cassie flung her hand in front of her eyes and turned her head away to protect herself from flying glass. At the same time, she bent to retrieve her own glass shard. Because beneath her gibbering fear, she still wanted to live. Then she straightened.</p><p>Who to face? But her subconscious recognized the real danger. She looked at where the coffin had rested. . . .</p><p>At the man crouched among the shattered remains, all smooth bare skin and hard muscle. Cuts from the broken glass dripped blood that trailed over his chest and stomach. His tangled dark hair framed a face that spoke of violence in shadowed planes and sharp edges. He stared at her, his black eyes alive with rage and something so predatory that she stepped back. Len seemed safe compared to this . . . She wasn\u2019t sure anymore. The word \u201cman\u201d suggested human. Too tame a category for what glared back at her. Male. Definitely male. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she stared with unblinking horror, he curled back his upper lip, exposing long sharp fangs.</p><p>She gripped her small glass shard so tightly it dug into her palm. Blood trickled between her fingers. The pain kept things real, because on some level she still wanted to believe she\u2019d wandered into a dark nightmare alley. But this was no dream. And she didn\u2019t have any illusions that her puny weapon would stop him.</p><p>Then she realized he wasn\u2019t looking at her any longer. His gaze swept past her to focus on Len, who was throwing himself against the door in a vain effort to break it down. The force of his desperation shook the room.</p> <p>The fanged . . . male laughed, a soft sound that terrified her more than an angry roar ever would. She edged over to the wall and pressed herself flat against it, wished she could sink into it and disappear, and prayed to a God she hadn\u2019t spoken to since she was ten.</p><p>\u201cLeaving so soon?\u201d</p><p>His voice was dark and deep, filled with such menace that she had to force herself not to join Len in flinging herself against the door. Instinct whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re prey. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t breathe. Don\u2019t call attention to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I don\u2019t have more time to discuss things with you\u2014life, death, and how payback is a bitch.\u201d He didn\u2019t move closer to Len.</p><p>Len finally turned away from the door. All color had drained from his face, his eyes were wide and staring. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t. Tony did the binding.\u201d He sounded almost incoherent.</p> <p>\u201cBut Tony is dead. That only leaves you.\u201d He sounded regretful that Tony was beyond his reach. Then he smiled.</p><p>Cassie shuddered. She felt what was coming, sensed death filling the room, the air thick with fear and finality. She told herself to close her eyes.</p><p>She watched.</p><p>Suddenly, Len\u2019s head jerked sharply to the left, farther than any human neck should be able to twist. If there was an accompanying sound, Cassie couldn\u2019t hear it past the roaring in her head. Len dropped to the floor. Cassie recognized death in his loose-limbed sprawl and empty eyes. And no one had touched him.</p><p>She stared at Len\u2019s killer. Was she imagining the slight change in his face\u2014the more predatory shape of his eyes, a more dangerous slant to his mouth? Cassie blinked. Of course she was. No way could she trust any of her senses right now.</p><p>It was too much, too much. She slowly slid down the wall until she was sitting. She opened her hand and released the bloody piece of glass. Cassie couldn\u2019t even blink as she stared past Felicity, Tony, and Len. She\u2019d finally found something that frightened her more than dead bodies.</p> <p>He ignored her as he methodically stripped Len of his clothes. He pulled on the dead man\u2019s pants and shrugged into his shirt. He glanced at the shoes. \u201cToo damn big.\u201d But he put them on anyway. Finally, he turned his attention to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d He moved closer.</p><p>Cassie should be a shaking, drooling puddle of terror, but she felt strangely calm. Her heart still pounded way too fast, and she knew her breathing wasn\u2019t normal, but she felt detached from what was going on around her. He would kill her now. He didn\u2019t need to know her name to do that. But she couldn\u2019t work up enough emotion to care. \u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>He crouched in front of her. \u201cWell, Cassie, we need to get the hell out of here. Now.\u201d He reached for her.</p><p>She started to cringe away from him but then stopped. Get out of here? He wasn\u2019t going to kill her? Why not? Cassie\u2019s thoughts felt as though they were slogging through knee-deep mud, each word coming loose with a sucking sound.</p><p>His black gaze pierced her. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. If you stay in this room, Roland Garrity will take care of the job that Tony and Len botched. Even if you run home, you\u2019ll die. You can\u2019t hide from him.\u201d He grabbed her hand and hauled her to her feet.</p><p>She flinched at the sharp pain in her cut palm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss her reaction. Loosening his grip, he examined her bloody palm. \u201cNasty cut.\u201d He glanced up at her from under thick dark lashes. \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to tempt me.\u201d Without warning, he bent his head and slid his tongue across her palm.</p> <p>The stroke felt warm, and weird, and something . . . more. What should have been a shudder turned into a shiver. But she stopped wondering about her strange reaction as she stared at her palm. The cut was closing. And within a few heartbeats, she couldn\u2019t see where it had been. \u201cWhat . . . ? How . . . ?\u201d She knew her eyes must be wide and staring.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother answering. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting time. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to go with you?\u201d She realized she was in shock, but even knowing that, she couldn\u2019t shake the inertia holding her in its grip.</p><p>\u201cDid I say you had a choice?\u201d</p><p>He led her to the door, and she didn\u2019t fight him. Even through the shattered reality messing with her mind right now, she recognized the futility of trying to escape.</p><p>\u201cI need to call the police.\u201d She glanced back at Felicity. Her friend was dead. Soon the horror of what had happened would crash over her, and she\u2019d drown in her what-ifs and should-haves. But not now. Now her mind was still wrapped in a cotton wool world.</p><p>\u201cNo police.\u201d He barely touched the door and it swung open. \u201cTony would\u2019ve had instructions to call in as soon as you were dead. He hasn\u2019t called, so Garrity will know that something went wrong. Right now all of his people will be on their way. We don\u2019t want to be here when they arrive.\u201d He pulled her into the elevator and hit the top button.</p><p>\u201cBut the police . . .\u201d</p><p>He hissed at her. \u201cBy the time the police get here, the bodies will be gone. Where\u2019s your purse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they get rid of the bodies so fast?\u201d She winced. When had Felicity become just a body?</p><p>Cassie was starting to think again. She needed her cell phone and her car keys. Once out of the elevator, she ran down the hall with him right behind her. She grabbed her jacket and purse before following him out the back door. Night had fallen while people died in the funeral home\u2019s basement. She was selfish enough to be thankful she hadn\u2019t been one of them.</p><p>\u201cThey have . . . resources. Where did you park your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut front.\u201d She hadn\u2019t wanted her car sitting in the funeral home\u2019s parking lot. Stupid. As if death would stick to her tires if she parked it there.</p><p>They were almost to the street when he suddenly grew still\u2014not moving, not even breathing. Cassie looked away. His complete stillness creeped her out. She scanned the street. Quiet. A mixture of homes and businesses. For the first time, she really thought about running.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I\u2019d catch you. Besides, we don\u2019t have time for that crap. I can feel them. Any minute now they\u2019ll turn the corner and see us.\u201d He\u2019d emerged from his suspended animation thing and herded her toward the street.</p><p>How had he known . . . ? No, she\u2019d think about that later.</p><p>When they reached her car, he took her keys from her and slid into the driver\u2019s seat. She didn\u2019t argue. Her mind was starting to function, and depending on his answers to her questions, she might decide to bail at a stoplight along the way. Then she remembered. He could kill without touching his victim.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t need to kill you. All the doors are locked. Relax and enjoy the ride.\u201d He pulled away from the curb and merged into Philly traffic.</p><p>Cassie sucked in her breath. Okay, she couldn\u2019t ignore it this time. Her fear had receded a little, but now it came flooding back. \u201cYou were in my mind.\u201d Breathe, breathe. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her and smiled. The smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes.</p><p>Blue eyes. Straight, even teeth. She folded her hands in her lap to stop their shaking. Had she hallucinated the black eyes and fangs? Had seeing Felicity\u2019s corpse pushed her over the edge? She closed her eyes for a moment, and once again saw his body lying in that glass coffin with the headstone beside it. She opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs your name Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo check on some friends.\u201d</p><p>Ask him. The sensation of the world she thought she knew flipping upside down made her want to throw up. Ask him. Cassie had never thought she was a coward except for her horror of dead bodies. But at least there was a good reason for that particular phobia. The fear she\u2019d felt in that room, though, proved she\u2019d never make anyone\u2019s top ten fearless women list. To make up for her total shutdown back there, she had to ask him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Please, please don\u2019t say it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m vampire.\u201d He never took his eyes from traffic. \u201cBut you knew that already, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no such things as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are. I\u2019m one. Get over it. We don\u2019t have time for you to have hysterics.\u201d His voice was cold, devoid of any sympathy, any understanding.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d react to name-calling, but for just this moment she didn\u2019t care. Surprised, she realized that some of her fear had faded. No matter what he was, or said he was, he hadn\u2019t killed her yet. Maybe a person could only sustain mind-numbing terror for so long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTechnically, no. If you\u2019re making a judgment of my character, though, then you\u2019ve nailed it. Give me your phone.\u201d</p><p>Cassie pulled her cell phone from her purse and handed it to him, then watched as he tapped in a number while weaving in and out of traffic.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>He took his attention from the road to stare at her. \u201cI can\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Did anyone really have eyes that blue? Pale skin, blue eyes, dark hair. She\u2019d guess at an Irish ancestry. But then what did she know about vampires? They all had pale skin, didn\u2019t they?</p><p>Vampire. She flinched as she thought the word. Even after everything she\u2019d seen, she wasn\u2019t doing a great job of wrapping her mind around the realness of him.</p><p>She waited quietly as he tried to make his call, then another and another. No one answered. He didn\u2019t leave any messages. And he didn\u2019t return her phone.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d He sped up.</p> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d She was substituting snark for courage.</p><p>A short time later, he parked on a street lined with row houses. Cassie didn\u2019t have a clue what part of the city this was. She\u2019d moved to Philly a month ago to search for a job. The city was still strange to her, and getting stranger every minute.</p><p>They got out and he led her down a side street before turning into an alley that ran behind the houses. \u201cWe\u2019ll be going in the back way.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t care which entrance they used. She was still fixated on the vampire thing. \u201cIf you\u2019re a vampire, couldn\u2019t you just dematerialize and pop up wherever you wanted? Avoid traffic?\u201d Avoid women who won\u2019t shut up? She closed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot one of my powers. But I can move so fast humans think that I\u2019ve vanished. Can\u2019t move that quickly right now, though. Energy\u2019s low. I was in that damn coffin for days. And killing Len drained whatever I had left. I need to feed.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWant to volunteer?\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes. He was joking, right? \u201cUmm, no.\u201d</p> <p>He looked away and picked up his pace. He was walking so fast now that she almost had to run to keep up.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound as though he was joking.</p><p>She could see him studying a man who was outside emptying his trash. Don\u2019t even think about it. She wouldn\u2019t survive watching him chug down a human energy drink. Cassie rushed into speech. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my house. Three of my friends are staying there with me.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cNone of them answered when I tried to call.\u201d</p><p>Please, no more life-or-death moments today. Sudden weariness washed over her. Her adrenaline supply must be running low. \u201cWon\u2019t Garrity check there first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t capture me there, so he might not know about it.\u201d His smile was a mere baring of teeth. \u201cAnd if he does, he\u2019ll think I\u2019m too smart to go home. He vastly overestimates my intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if he has people watching the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill them.\u201d</p> <p>His answer would\u2019ve horrified Cassie this morning. Now? It made perfect sense.</p><p>He finally slowed down and moved into the shadows. Silently, he pointed at a brick row house with a green rocker on the back porch. She covered her mouth to keep from giggling at the image of a vampire rocking on his porch. Or maybe the urge to giggle was the first stage of hysteria.</p><p>Sliding along fences and gliding around trash cans\u2014he slid and glided, she shuffled and tripped\u2014they drew close to the house. Then he raised his hand to stop her. He grew still again, and she held her breath. She wanted the house to be empty so they could leave for somewhere safe.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one person in there.\u201d He sounded grim.</p><p>She didn\u2019t question how he knew. \u201cAnyone you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With no other explanation, he guided her to the back door. He did his magic door-opening thing again and slipped into a darkened kitchen. He beckoned her inside.</p><p>Cassie was beyond thought, beyond feeling, beyond everything. Right now he was the only real thing in her life. So she followed him.</p><p>He moved quietly into what must be the living room. She couldn\u2019t hear his footsteps. Behind him, she was an elephant tramping through a field of bubble wrap, announcing her presence with every step she took.</p><p>For the first time, she noticed the smell. It was coppery and too familiar.</p><p>He stopped so suddenly that she almost slammed into his back.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ethan.\u201d The male voice came from whoever was sitting in an overstuffed chair she could see silhouetted in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cDan. What\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s voice might sound neutral, but she sensed tension, and something else.</p><p>\u201cTrying to figure out who the hell to call.\u201d The man\u2019s, or maybe vampire\u2019s, voice sounded terrified. \u201cI couldn\u2019t reach you on your cell. Then I came here. I used the key you gave me. No one was here, but . . .\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>Cassie moved up beside Ethan. Her eyes had adjusted to the dark and there was a tiny bit of light filtering in through the slats of the blinds. She could now see that the room was trashed\u2014furniture overturned and pictures knocked from the wall. There were dark stains on the walls and carpet. \u201cIs that . . . ?\u201d Blood.</p><p>The other man said it for her. \u201cThere\u2019s freaking blood everywhere. Fresh blood. What\u2019s going on, Ethan?\u201d</p><p>That explained the coppery scent. The rising panic in his voice mirrored her own emotions. She wished someone would turn on a light so she could see both of them. Then she thought of Roland Garrity hunting them and decided the darkness was just fine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Do you have your car?\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t have to be particularly sensitive to feel Ethan\u2019s rage. It didn\u2019t seem aimed at the man in the chair. She thought that Roland Garrity should be very afraid.</p><p>\u201cNo. There was nowhere to park, so June just dropped me off. I told her I didn\u2019t know how long I was staying, and I\u2019d call her when I was ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>Cassie had kept silent as long as she could. \u201cWho is this, Ethan?\u201d Using his name sort of moved him a little out of the mythic-monster column into the almost-human one.</p><p>Ethan turned to look at her. In the darkness, his face became a stranger\u2019s again, all sharp planes and dangerous shadows. She\u2019d been wrong. He wasn\u2019t even close to the human column.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dan. My brother.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Why the hell had he brought her with him, and what was he supposed to do with her? Ethan wasn\u2019t impulsive, so his unexplained need to keep her out of Roland Garrity\u2019s hands didn\u2019t make any kind of sense. He should\u2019ve just sent her on her way with a warning not to go home.</p><p>Whatever his reason, he had to park her in a safe place soon because he could feel his Second One beginning to rise. And if she thought he was terrifying now, did he have a surprise for her in a few hours.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your brother?\u201d</p><p>Her expression said everything her words hadn\u2019t\u2014monsters didn\u2019t have mothers, fathers, brothers. Definitely should\u2019ve ditched her.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just wondering\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can wonder later. I\u2019ll grab a few clothes and then we have to get out of here.\u201d I was just wondering how many throats you\u2019ve torn out, how often the bloodlust drives you to murder, if you have a conscience, a soul. Not as many as you\u2019d think, never, sometimes, and probably not. He\u2019d keep his answers to himself, though.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to comment as he strode to his bedroom, crammed some clothes and shoes into a bag, and then handed the bag to his brother. Quickly, he herded everyone out the back door, through the tiny yard, and into the alley. If Garrity had someone keeping an eye on the place, they must be out front because he didn\u2019t sense watchers nearby.</p><p>Then he paused. His place had looked as though a bomb had gone off inside it. There must\u2019ve been lots of noise. The row houses were connected. Mrs. Kimsky didn\u2019t get around much anymore. She would\u2019ve been home. And what about George and Janice on his other side? They only went out on Friday nights. This was Wednesday. If any of them had heard a fight in his house, they would\u2019ve called the police. They hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Keep going. Being vampire means checking your emotions at the door. Yeah, that was why Cassie was standing in this alley with him. Because he was so good at not feeling anything. No use fighting it, he was going to check on his neighbors.</p><p>\u201cI have to do something before we leave. Stay close and don\u2019t make any noise.\u201d He speared Cassie with a glare intended to keep her quiet for a few minutes.</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t say anything. He knew what his brother was, and he understood the need for caution.</p><p>Ethan went through the back gate and across the small yard. Mrs. Kimsky\u2019s door was unlocked. Not a good sign. \u201cStep in and shut the door. Stay here and let me do the checking.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have far to go. What was left of his neighbor lay on the living room floor. In pieces. Blood was soaking into the carpet. The TV was still on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d Horror filled Cassie\u2019s hoarse whisper behind him.</p><p>He glanced back. \u201cI told you to let me . . .\u201d</p><p>Cassie stared at the body, her eyes wide, unblinking. There was so much fear. She shook with it. Bracing herself against the doorjamb, she covered her mouth with her hand. To hold back a scream or to keep from throwing up? Maybe both.</p> <p>Ethan could hear Dan puking into the kitchen sink. \u201cNext time listen to me.\u201d He sounded hard. Good. He wanted them to believe he was a cold-blooded son of a bitch. Because he was\u2014he closed his eyes for a moment\u2014most of the time. \u201cOpen the door and get some air. Both of you. I have to find something.\u201d He didn\u2019t look to see if they followed his directions.</p><p>Trying to make sure he didn\u2019t step in any blood, he went into the bathroom. He pulled a large bath towel out of the linen closet and began his hunt. A few minutes later he joined the other two at the door with a spitting, hissing bundle of pissed off cat safely wrapped in the towel. He watched Cassie\u2019s eyes widen when she saw the bloody claw marks on his hands and arms.</p><p>He scowled at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to say anything because Dan spoke. \u201cYou\u2019re taking the old lady\u2019s cat with you?\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t have time for explanations. \u201cOut. I have to check the people on the other side of my place.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone was silent as they walked to the second house. Ethan knew what he\u2019d find. The hunters must\u2019ve left the door open because he could smell blood and death long before they climbed the steps.</p><p>Dan stopped on the porch. He put the bag of clothes down. \u201cThis is as far as I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cHere. Hold the cat.\u201d He shoved the animal at his brother before stepping into the house.</p><p>Cassie walked in behind him.</p><p>He paused in the kitchen. \u201cThis will be just as bad. Wait with Dan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I need to see it.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve been afraid of the dead all my life. But my best friend is one of those dead now. This is more important than my fear. I have to see what they did so I\u2019ll never forget, so I\u2019ll know exactly what I\u2019m destroying when I take these animals down.\u201d</p><p>Ethan raised one brow. Wow, where had that come from? Beneath all her fear, something fierce lived. He looked away. He didn\u2019t want to find her interesting in any way. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even imagine what things did this.\u201d</p><p>Cassie looked puzzled. \u201cRoland Garrity\u2019s people, right?\u201d Then she shook her head. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t believe humans would do that to an old woman.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d be surprised what humans would do. He walked toward the dining room. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do the actual killing, but they held the remote.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t understand. He hoped she\u2019d never have to.</p><p>They found George and Janice on the stairs. They must\u2019ve tried to flee to the second floor. It hadn\u2019t worked. Body parts littered the steps and blood dripped over the side onto the floor below.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t last this time. She ran for the downstairs bathroom and slammed the door behind her. He waited until her retching stopped. When she finally opened the door and joined him, she was pale but steady. He said nothing, only returned to the back door. He waited until she was outside before closing it carefully behind him.</p><p>But even closed, he could still smell the blood. The Second One screamed, clawing at his soul, demanding that he feed, kill. He clamped down on his hunger. But it wasn\u2019t the hunger for blood that would grip him soon. He hoped Cassie was gone by then.</p><p>Dan took one look at the stark horror in Cassie\u2019s eyes and didn\u2019t ask any questions.</p> <p>Ethan talked to his brother on the way to Cassie\u2019s car. \u201cYou\u2019re still living at June\u2019s place?\u201d</p><p>Dan nodded. \u201cThings haven\u2019t been too great between us lately, though. I\u2019m thinking about moving back to my own condo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. At least not until things are safer.\u201d The ones who\u2019d found him might not know about his brother, or where he lived. But Ethan didn\u2019t want to take a chance. Dan would be safer staying with his girlfriend for now.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d Frustration roughened Dan\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d They\u2019d reached the car. \u201cOnce I figure it out myself.\u201d</p><p>Ethan slid into the driver\u2019s side and headed back out into traffic. He\u2019d made sure that Cassie was beside him. She\u2019d be easier to control in the front seat. At least she hadn\u2019t blurted anything about what had happened at the funeral home. In fact, she hadn\u2019t said anything for too long. Probably in shock from the last few hours.</p><p>The only one who had anything to say on the drive was the cat, and she kept up a constant stream of yowling complaints. Finally, Ethan pulled over a few blocks from June\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you out here. No one followed us, but I still don\u2019t want to take the chance that someone might see you going into June\u2019s building.\u201d</p><p>Dan didn\u2019t comment as he handed the cat over to Cassie, got out, and slammed the door. Ethan watched him walk into a store that was still open. Then he pulled away from the curb. And just when he was wondering if Cassie would ever talk again, the floodgates broke.</p><p>\u201cWe need to call the police. You can\u2019t leave those poor people alone like that in their houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it when we stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you taking me?\u201d She didn\u2019t do a great job of covering the quaver in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere safe for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to explain what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, way to ease my fears with your detailed explanations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s been a long night. Let\u2019s save all the questions until we can relax and get something to eat.\u201d The word \u201ceat\u201d drove his hunger into a frothing frenzy. It didn\u2019t help that he could hear her heartbeat, sense the blood coursing through her veins, and knew that all he had to do was stop the car and . . . No. He stomped the hunger into submission.</p><p>He concentrated instead on the slight shifts he could feel in his facial muscles, the tingling in his fingertips, and the tightening of Len\u2019s borrowed shirt across his shoulders. Not enough change for her to notice yet. But soon, very soon, she\u2019d see.</p><p>There was a long simmering pause.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you bring the cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo eat. You wouldn\u2019t volunteer, so . . .\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>She gasped and tightened her grip on the cat. The cat rewarded her with an annoyed hiss.</p><p>If the last few days hadn\u2019t sucked so badly, he would\u2019ve laughed. Or maybe not. The idea that she might actually believe he ate small animals bothered him. Not comforting. Nothing she said or did should be able to touch him.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I don\u2019t eat cats.\u201d He knew he sounded angry. But it seemed that everything about her made him mad. Those big brown eyes and all that blond hair don\u2019t make you mad. Neither does the rest of her body. Okay, so maybe it was all about sex deprivation. He could live with that explanation.</p><p>She nodded and some of the tension left her. \u201cHow old is your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThen that means you can\u2019t be ancient.\u201d The fact that he wasn\u2019t seemed to bother her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-two, but I was turned when I was twenty-eight. So I\u2019ll pretty much look that age forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw you kill Len without touching him. Doesn\u2019t a vampire have to be old and powerful to do that?\u201d</p><p>He made an impatient sound. \u201cPower doesn\u2019t come with age. Wisdom does. And a smart vampire will live a long happy life.\u201d He thought about that. \u201cOr unlife. If that\u2019s not a word, it should be.\u201d</p><p>Her questions stopped for a short time while he bought cat food and litter box stuff. Once back in the car, he hoped she\u2019d run out of things to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you save me?\u201d</p><p>There it was. The one question he\u2019d hoped she\u2019d keep for later. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d An honest answer.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look satisfied. Too bad. Relieved, he pulled in beside Zareb\u2019s warehouse.</p><p>Cassie seemed to finally realize they\u2019d stopped. She looked around. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warehouse. That\u2019s the Delaware.\u201d He pointed to where she could just see the river flowing dark and cold past the back of the building. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a residential part of Philly. Once the warehouses shut down for the night, the area pretty much empties of traffic and people. We\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>They climbed out of the car. It was so quiet their footsteps rang loud in the darkness. Even the cat had shut up. Nothing moved. She tugged her jacket more tightly around her. The night must\u2019ve turned cold. He felt nothing. For a moment, he considered pulling her against him, but offering warmth or comfort would only lead to other temptations. He led her toward a door hidden in the shadows.</p><p>He pressed a small button next to the door and waited. She shivered beside him, and with a frustrated curse he gave in and wrapped his arm around her. When she moved closer, he wasn\u2019t sure if it was an attempt to get warm or a lesser-of-two-evils thing. Even a human had to pick up on the scary vibes surrounding this place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After what seemed forever, the door creaked slowly open. No light came from inside. No one stood in the opening. If anything, the blackness seemed deeper, more silent than the night.

The door closed behind them.</p> <p>\u201cCome.\u201d The voice was a deep rumble. Disembodied. Terrifying.</p><p>Even knowing who spoke, Ethan couldn\u2019t control an instinctive shudder. He led Cassie further into the darkness.</p><p>Suddenly, a candle flickered on, quickly followed by more and more until the room was ablaze with their glimmering lights. With a quiet whoosh, flames leaped in the fireplace.</p><p>A figure glided from the shadows. Tall and muscular, he moved with that strange flowing motion only very old vampires achieved, those who no longer remembered they\u2019d once been human.</p><p>Ethan knew by Cassie\u2019s frightened gasp when she finally got a good look at their host. And if Ethan hadn\u2019t been determined not to make an ass of himself, he would\u2019ve gasped too.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Ethan.\u201d The vampire shifted his gaze to Cassie. \u201cYou come bearing gifts. A beautiful woman and . . .\u201d</p><p>Screeching and hissing, the cat leaped from Cassie\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cA bad-tempered cat.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWe\u2019ll dine well tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grabbed her hand before she could make a dash back to the door.</p><p>\u201cCassie, meet Zareb.\u201d He took a deep breath he no longer needed. \u201cMy maker.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Cassie didn\u2019t think there was room inside her for more fear. She was wrong. Zareb had an overwhelming presence. His movements were too fast, too smooth, too predatory. He\u2019d pulled his long black hair back and fastened it with a leather thong that had a silver medallion on it. His sharp cheekbones and exotic darkness drew attention to his eyes. He had terrifying eyes. They were slightly tilted and glowed yellow. Glowed. Yellow. No white showed, and he had vertical slits for pupils. Cat eyes.</p><p>The yellow glow should have been the scariest part of him. It wasn\u2019t. There was something else. . . .</p><p>He captured her with his eerie stare, and suddenly she couldn\u2019t understand why she had ever thought his eyes were strange. His gaze drew her, filled her with a yearning that was almost pain. It reached down, down to a place never touched before.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t blink, couldn\u2019t look away, couldn\u2019t control the erratic beating of her heart, and couldn\u2019t seem to breathe. Cassie gasped for air even as she sank into the alien beauty of those eyes. And if her heartbeat felt as though it was stalling, threatening to stop altogether, she couldn\u2019t muster the energy to worry about it while the yearning grew and grew.</p><p>Cassie jerked as Ethan commanded, \u201cStop it.\u201d She didn\u2019t think he was talking to her.</p><p>Startled, she closed her eyes. She concentrated on breathing and felt her heartbeat kick back into a normal rhythm. What had just happened? You couldn\u2019t breathe, your heart was stopping. She\u2019d almost died.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, Zareb had turned his attention to Ethan.</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you\u2019d brought her as a gift to atone for abandoning your loving father.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan simply stared at him from the shadows.</p><p>Zareb smiled. \u201cI suppose the loving father reference was a bit overdone. But you do owe me some recompense for my anger, and yes, there were a few moments\u2014very few, I\u2019ll admit\u2014of heartfelt sorrow.\u201d</p><p>Ethan made a dismissive sound. \u201cI brought you a pet that will suit your \u2018loving\u2019 personality.\u201d</p><p>The cat poked her head from beneath the couch and hissed her general discontent with everyone in the room.</p><p>Zareb\u2019s smile widened. \u201cSo you have.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s whole body thrummed with her need to run to the door, rip it open, and race screaming into the night. Her instinct had it right, but her mind insisted she listen to reason.</p><p>Even if she could escape, even if she could go home, even if she could be safe there . . . Okay, so none of those \u201ceven ifs\u201d were viable options. And it wasn\u2019t just about her anymore. If she tried to run to family, to friends, she\u2019d put them in danger too. The police? They\u2019d question her and then release her. Back to square one.</p><p>Besides, wherever she went, her nightmares would follow. She still saw Felicity\u2019s body and those other people when she closed her eyes. If Cassie didn\u2019t do something to help stop the ones who had murdered her friend, she might never sleep again.</p><p>At this moment, Ethan offered her a lifeline, even if it was frayed and liable to dump her into the deep without warning.</p><p>She blinked hard. No tears. Not yet. She would do the sobbing and wailing thing in private, if they ever allowed her to be alone again. If she lived long enough. Until then, Cassie would stuff the huge empty place inside her with answers to her questions. She took a deep breath and met Zareb\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat did you just do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen.\u201d Zareb\u2019s sigh was filled with drama and sly amusement. \u201cThey can never just accept things. They always want explanations.\u201d</p><p>Thank heaven he didn\u2019t try to meet her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI was merely playing. I rarely allow myself recreation time. You wouldn\u2019t have died.\u201d He cast a quick glance her way. \u201cI\u2019m very careful not to kill unless it\u2019s unavoidable. I\u2019ve killed often over the centuries, and the Second One is too close, too powerful now.\u201d</p><p>What did that even mean? Since he didn\u2019t offer to explain, she launched another question. \u201cDid you make Ethan vampire because he was dying and that was the only way you could save him?\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised in the same way he would if the cat had spoken to him. \u201cNo. I was bored that night, and I hadn\u2019t made any children in a long time.\u201d He shrugged powerful shoulders. \u201cIt was simply a need to procreate. So I made Ethan vampire.\u201d His full lips twitched in the tiniest of smiles. \u201cHe was angry with me for a very long time. In fact, this is the first time he\u2019s visited me of his own free will. I\u2019m ecstatic.\u201d</p><p>Well, Cassie could get rid of any heart-of-gold hopes she had regarding him.</p><p>Zareb looked at Ethan. \u201cI assume there\u2019s some pressing reason for your presence here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a situation.\u201d</p><p>Ethan still stood in the shadows. Cassie frowned. She couldn\u2019t see his features clearly, but she would swear there was something different about him, something changing. She pushed the thought away. Too much had happened today, and her mind was probably a little unreliable right now.</p><p>Zareb glanced at the cat hiding under his couch and at Cassie. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d He motioned toward the couch. \u201cSince you\u2019ve already interrupted my busy night, you may as well sit down.\u201d</p><p>Cassie walked to the couch and sat on the edge. The cat seemed to think that underneath it was a better place to be. The cat was probably right. Ethan didn\u2019t leave the shadows.</p><p>Zareb stood beside the couch staring at Ethan. \u201cYou killed tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d The question just popped out of Cassie. And when Zareb turned his yellow gaze on her, she felt her courage shrivel and crawl down her throat. He was just that scary.</p><p>\u201cThe Second One is rising.\u201d</p><p>Zareb evidently thought his explanation was sufficient because he turned back to Ethan. \u201cYou have about two hours. The woman must eat and you must feed. I was about to make a dinner run when you arrived, and since the woman doesn\u2019t seem to be on the menu, I\u2019ll pick up something for you on the way back.\u201d His eyes narrowed, yellow cat eyes filled with darkness. \u201cDo I need to bring the others with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s heartbeat picked up its pace. Ethan\u2019s voice . . . It was different\u2014deeper, smoother, more threatening. And for one mad moment she wanted to ask Zareb to take her with him. Then she thought about his eyes. Maybe not. He moved toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Cassie couldn\u2019t do much for the dead, but this one thing she could do. \u201cThe police. They need to know about the dead people in those houses.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why that was so important to her. The dead sure didn\u2019t care. But she cared.</p><p>Zareb raised one brow. \u201cDead people?\u201d He looked at Ethan.</p><p>\u201cThe dead are in the houses next to mine. I didn\u2019t kill them. Explanations when you come back.\u201d</p><p>Zareb nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll make an anonymous call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where I live?\u201d Ethan sounded surprised, and not too happy.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Zareb sounded amused. \u201cI made you. You can never hide from me.\u201d And then he was gone.</p><p>Silence settled over the room, the shadows seemed to thicken, and Cassie\u2019s fear expanded exponentially. She took a deep breath. \u201cYou may as well come out where I can see you. Not knowing what\u2019s going on is scaring me more than if you\u2019ve morphed into something gross.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s cold laughter scraped along her nerves, frightening enough for her to rethink her come-out-of-the-shadows request. Some things were better not seen.</p><p>Too late. He moved so quickly that she didn\u2019t even have time to gasp, to run into the bathroom and hope the door had a lock. He was simply there beside her on the couch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie stared at him and swallowed hard. Don\u2019t scream. Prey screamed. Prey ran. Prey died.</p><p>He leaned close and smiled. \u201cIt will get worse before it gets better.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away, a bird caught by a raptor\u2019s stare. He looked bigger, harder. He\u2019d split Len\u2019s shirt, exposing a broad expanse of muscled chest and abs. Cassie was tempted to continue staring at his chest, because the rest of him was . . .</p> <p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>The voice in her head was warm and rough and an absolute compulsion. Slowly, reluctantly, she lifted her gaze to his face.</p><p>Cassie now knew the true meaning of terrifying beauty. His hair had become a silken fall so black that it shone with blue highlights. And his face . . . What was happening to his face? His eyes seemed larger, and they now had the same tilt as Zareb\u2019s eyes. They were green with no white showing and vertical slits for pupils. Cat eyes.</p><p>She pushed words past lips that felt frozen. \u201cWill they be yellow like Zareb\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cBlue and yellow make green. In two hours they\u2019ll be pure yellow.\u201d</p> <p>His voice was darkness, leading to places she feared but would explore if he beckoned. No. She wouldn\u2019t explore anywhere with him. His eyes probably had the same power that Zareb\u2019s had. Even as she pummeled herself for her momentary weakness, she reached out to run her fingers lightly along his jaw and watched it clench.</p><p>\u201cIs this the Second One you\u2019ve been talking about?\u201d If so, he was the most beautiful thing she\u2019d ever seen. Words couldn\u2019t describe him, so she didn\u2019t try. Cassie only knew his beauty hurt, a deep hungry hurt that made her yearn. . . .</p><p>Cassie yanked her hand away from his face. She knew her eyes were wide. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the same thing that Zareb was doing.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look away. \u201cNot yet. Even Zareb wasn\u2019t showing you the full power of the Second One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d She was tired of not knowing, not understanding. Cassie had been lost since the moment she\u2019d walked into Eternal Rest Funeral Home.</p><p>Ethan finally moved. He stood and then paced over to the fireplace. \u201cThe ones who wrote the vampire legends were wrong.\u201d He stood with his back to the flames. \u201cIt was never about bloodlust. We can feed whenever we want. We\u2019re no more ruled by our hunger than you are.\u201d He turned his back to the fire and stared at her. \u201cIt was always about the kill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZareb said he knew you\u2019d killed because the Second One was rising. Who or what is the Second One?\u201d Fascinated, she watched his face changing in small increments even as they talked\u2014lower lip growing fuller, lashes lengthening, each change making him more breathtaking. Then she looked away. Beauty that hurt to look at couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cThe First One is our humanity. Even as vampire it\u2019s dominant unless we kill. The act of killing wakens the Second One.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound as though the Second One is a separate entity.\u201d Trying to keep from staring at him became harder with every passing moment.</p><p>\u201cIt is. The Second One is an elemental consciousness passed on in the blood my maker used to create me. It lies dormant until it senses a kill. It doesn\u2019t care about conscience or human emotions. Its primal drive is to destroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what I saw today, I don\u2019t think you need any help in the killing department.\u201d Fear coated Cassie\u2019s thoughts, making it tough for her to concentrate. He\u2019s turning into this thing. I\u2019m alone with him, alone with him, alone with\u2014She shook her head to clear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat I did today is my particular vampire talent, not attached to the Second One. I have control of when and how I use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning you don\u2019t have control of the Second One.\u201d She stared down at her hands. Blood. Her hands were covered with dried blood. So were the rest of her clothes, even her shoes. How had she not noticed before this? His voice dragged her back.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop the change. It\u2019s not that it makes me lose control, it\u2019s . . .\u201d For the first time he seemed lost for words.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d No matter what he said, it wouldn\u2019t matter, because Cassie had reached her limit for shocking disclosures. Her mind was beginning to shut down, refusing to react emotionally, trying to protect itself. A little too late.</p><p>\u201cScientists are finding out more things about the brain every day.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. What the hell did that have to do with anything?</p><p>\u201cSome believe that beauty stimulates primal brain circuits. It\u2019s not a response anyone can control any more than they can control their reaction to cocaine.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd if the beauty is extreme, it acts as an overdose and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople die.\u201d She remembered the feeling of her heart slowing, faltering, almost stopping. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d But she did.</p><p>\u201cThe beauty of the Second One\u2019s face attracts its victims, its eyes hold them captive while it kills.\u201d He turned to face the fireplace, his back straight, tension radiating from him. \u201cIn two hours you won\u2019t be able to look at me. If you try, the Second One will kill you. I\u2019ll be Medusa in reverse.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her fear as she stood. \u201cThen I won\u2019t look at you.\u201d Even though I want to so badly it hurts. \u201cI . . . I have to take a shower, change clothes.\u201d She raked her fingers through her tangled hair. She couldn\u2019t think. Clothes. She didn\u2019t have any, and she couldn\u2019t see herself returning to Felicity\u2019s condo anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom is down the hall to the right. There\u2019s a lock on the door.\u201d</p><p>Left unsaid was that a lock probably wouldn\u2019t stop a determined vampire. But Cassie was too desperate to shed her bloody clothes, to scrub the blood from her body to care. \u201cClothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe closet across from the bathroom. Zareb . . . entertains a lot. You should find something to fit you.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded even though he still faced the fireplace. She grabbed her purse and scurried down the hallway. From the closet she grabbed a top, pants, and a pair of shoes that looked as though they\u2019d fit, then locked herself in the bathroom.</p><p>A little of her tension eased away as the hot water sluiced over her body. Cassie scrubbed until her skin felt raw, until not a speck of blood remained. And she thought about Ethan.</p><p>What she\u2019d felt when she looked at him, the yearning, wasn\u2019t the same as what she\u2019d felt for Zareb. Yes, she understood that in both cases she was reacting to the Second One in them, but still, it had felt different with Ethan\u2014more personal, more . . . something.</p><p>Once out of the shower, she used the dryer lying on the counter for her hair and then pulled her makeup bag from her purse. The makeup, the hair, they were important. They gave her confidence, and confidence along with a few weapons would be all she\u2019d have tonight. And Ethan. A vampire. Funny, just when she\u2019d thought she had life figured out, it had given her a swift kick in the behind.</p><p>Cassie was still thinking about her reaction to Ethan as she dressed in her borrowed clothes and then returned to the living room. Head down, lost in thought, she had almost reached the couch before the complete silence hit her\u2014no greeting from Ethan, no hisses from the cat, not even the crackling of the fire. She looked up.</p><p>Vampires, lots of them, stood in the shadows at the edges of the room. Motionless, silent, they watched her from gleaming eyes, hungry eyes. Except for one. He wore sunglasses and had a hoodie that hid most of his face. Which was scarier, what she could or couldn\u2019t see? Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Zareb broke the silence. \u201cEthan told me what happened to both of you.\u201d He pointed to a bag he\u2019d set on the coffee table. \u201cI stopped at McDonald\u2019s. Ethan already ate.\u201d He didn\u2019t offer to explain.</p><p>A vampire stopping at McDonald\u2019s. That should make her laugh, but all Cassie could do was shudder at the thought of all those silent killers listening as the water ran\u2014imagining, hungering.</p><p>\u201cMy children and I will be paying a visit to Eternal Rest as soon as Ethan\u2019s change is complete.\u201d The predator lived in Zareb\u2019s voice, his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here with the cat.\u201d</p><p>Cassie opened her mouth and said what was probably the most stupid thing she\u2019d ever uttered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cDid she just defy you, Zareb?\u201d Darren\u2019s voice was quietly mocking.</p><p>Ethan frowned. Darren wasn\u2019t one of his favorite vampire brothers. He\u2019d killed too often with too much enjoyment, and now the Second One was close to claiming him permanently. It made him eager for violence wherever he could find it. At least he\u2019d had the sense to wear his sunglasses and hoodie.</p><p>\u201cCan you allow that to go unpunished?\u201d Darren injected a fake note of concern into his voice.</p><p>Ethan ground his teeth. He\u2019d gladly separate Darren\u2019s useless head from his shoulders. The jerk wanted to see Zareb hurt Cassie. He lived for causing pain.</p><p>One glance at Cassie assured Ethan that she recognized the danger too. He crouched. When had his mind made the decision to defend her against his maker?</p><p>Zareb didn\u2019t even glance at Darren. \u201cYour need to see blood flow is much too obvious. Do you really think you can manipulate me, Darren?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Darren sounded nervous as he moved farther into the shadows.</p><p>Zareb\u2019s smile never reached his eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d He looked at Cassie. \u201cAnd why do you think you should come with us?\u201d His expression gave away nothing.</p><p>She fixed her gaze on the middle of his chest. \u201cIf someone found Ethan\u2019s home and attacked his friends, then who\u2019s to say they don\u2019t have a list of where all of you live? I don\u2019t think Cat and I would do a great job of defending the old homestead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that Cat is a ferocious warrior.\u201d Zareb\u2019s lips tipped up in a brief smile.</p><p>Ethan relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cBesides, they killed my friend. I want . . .\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI need to be there to see that they\u2019re punished.\u201d</p><p>Zareb nodded. \u201cI understand the hunger for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>She corrected him. \u201cJustice.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cCall it what you will. You deserve to see them punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting her come?\u201d Ethan narrowed his eyes. Amazing. His maker didn\u2019t do crap like this. Stupid. Who took a human into battle anyway?</p><p>Zareb moved toward the door. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t even try to explain away his need to protect her. \u201cShe\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her choice.\u201d Zareb\u2019s expression said the decision was made.</p><p>Ethan glared as he watched his maker head for the door. \u201cDo you still keep your weapons in the same place?\u201d</p> <p>Zareb paused. \u201cYes. You\u2019re going to arm her? Excellent idea. I\u2019ve learned that the least capable among us often perform extraordinary feats given the right incentives.\u201d Then he left. The other vampires disappeared after him.</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes the \u2018least capable\u2019 have skills that could put your butt in the ground.\u201d Her mumbled response was almost lost in the slamming of the door.</p><p>Ethan would have smiled, but he was too pissed to find anything funny right now. \u201cYou\u2019d be a lot safer here.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze challenged him. \u201cI\u2019ll be a lot \u2018safer\u2019 if I operate under the assumption that hiding isn\u2019t an option until these animals are stopped. Because from what you\u2019ve told me, they\u2019re very good at finding people, and a false sense of security could kill me.\u201d</p><p>Cassie was wrong. She hadn\u2019t seen what they\u2019d be facing.</p><p>He reached for another argument. \u201cWhat do you fear the most, Cassie?\u201d Whatever it was, he\u2019d use it to convince her to stay away from Eternal Rest.</p><p>\u201cHaving to cook dinner for my whole family? World\u2019s worst cook here.\u201d Her smile was small and tight, but at least it reached her eyes.</p><p>\u201cRight. Won\u2019t have to cook Garrity dinner.\u201d He searched his mind for a clue to her real fears.</p> <p>Then he remembered her words when she\u2019d seen the bodies of his neighbors: \u201cI\u2019ve been afraid of the dead all my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath. You\u2019re afraid to die.\u201d He knew he sounded triumphant. \u201cIf you go with us, there\u2019s a good chance it could happen.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him.</p><p>Frustrated, he watched her pull on a borrowed jacket. If she was determined to go, he\u2019d have to give her a weapon, for all the good it would do. Ethan turned to head down the hallway. He pulled open the door to the smallest bedroom, strode to the walk-in closet, and took the key from the hook beside the door.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Her voice was right behind him. \u201cDid you just get that key off the wall? I didn\u2019t see a key there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to see it. A cloaking spell. Zareb wears many hats. Sorcerer is one of them.\u201d He hoped he sounded as angry as he felt.</p><p>He could sense her rolling this latest bit of weirdness around in her mind. He yanked open the door and turned on the closet light.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Her hushed exclamation said it all.</p><p>\u201cWow, indeed.\u201d He stepped inside the huge walk-in closet and studied the hundreds of weapons lining its walls. \u201cCan you shoot a gun?\u201d As he spoke he lifted a small handgun from the wall.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She reached past him and chose a different one.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhy not the one I picked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve practiced with this one.\u201d</p><p>He watched as she chose ammunition and deftly loaded the gun. She shoved it into her purse.</p><p>Ethan studied her. \u201cYou\u2019re different from when I first met you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, just lifted a knife from the wall, chose a sheath, and strapped it to her thigh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big-ass knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I like it.\u201d She started to turn away.</p><p>\u201cThis is the real you, isn\u2019t it? So who was that person back in the funeral home?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes looked flat, expressionless. \u201cI killed the binder, didn\u2019t I? Oh, and I still don\u2019t know what a binder is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky. Who taught you how to use a gun and knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather.\u201d</p><p>He picked up on the slight hesitation before she said \u201cgrandfather.\u201d</p><p>Ethan had a gut feeling. \u201cDoes your grandfather have anything to do with your fear of death?\u201d Maybe she\u2019d seen him die. That could be traumatic for a kid.</p><p>He needed to know, and he was prepared to stand here until she told him. Ethan didn\u2019t have a clue why knowing was so important to him. This whole not-having-a-clue thing was getting old fast.</p><p>She met his gaze, and for a moment he thought she\u2019d refuse to explain. But then she sighed and looked past him. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death. I\u2019m afraid of dead bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Cassie hesitated, and he could almost hear her inner battle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know.\u201d He tried to soften his voice, but he hadn\u2019t done soft in a lot of years. His \u201csoft\u201d probably sounded like an angry growl.</p><p>He told himself that she knew his secrets so it was only fair that he know hers. But that wasn\u2019t the reason at all.</p><p>\u201cMy grandparents lived on a farm. Once a year my parents would leave me with them for a week. I loved the animals and all that space to play. My grandmother spoiled me the whole time I was there. My grandfather was a scary man once my parents had gone, though. He never touched me, but I saw how he treated his animals, how he treated Grandma. Even though she was afraid of him, she begged me not to tell my parents, because if he got mad he\u2019d have one of his \u2018spells.\u2019 She swore he was a good man, just crotchety in his old age. I was young, so I believed her.\u201d She still wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cWhen I was ten years old, my grandmother died. She\u2019d been sick, and one afternoon my grandfather came in from working in the fields to find her dead in her bed. He told me to go into the room and say my last good-byes to her. I was frightened. I refused.\u201d</p><p>Ethan watched her raise a shaking hand to push back a strand of hair.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d always been about staying strong and controlling situations. When his dogs didn\u2019t obey him, he tied them to a tree. When Grandma didn\u2019t obey him . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t really know because she never told me, but I suspect it must\u2019ve been bad for her to fear him that much. He\u2019d taught me to hunt, to know my way around most weapons by the time I was eight. He saw my refusal to go into that room as weakness. His cure was to chain me to my grandmother\u2019s bed, close the bedroom door, and leave me alone with her corpse for two days.\u201d</p><p>Ethan couldn\u2019t believe his explosion of fury. He hoped the man was still alive so he could kill him. The Second One murmured its approval.</p><p>\u201cHe released me on the third day. The first thing I did was to run all the way to the next farm and call my parents. They came and took me away. I never saw the old man again. I refused to talk about him, but a few months later Mom told me that he\u2019d been committed and that he would never hurt me again.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cIt was too late, though. That particular horse had already left the barn.\u201d Cassie finally looked directly at him. \u201cBut after what happened in the funeral home, after what they did to Felicity, you can count on me to do my part tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then she walked away. \u201cLet\u2019s get going before your maker sends someone to see what\u2019s keeping you.\u201d She didn\u2019t glance back as she walked into the living room. She stopped at the door. \u201cDid you feed the cat?\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled. Almost. Such an ordinary question in the midst of extraordinary events. \u201cYes. And Zareb took care of the litter box.\u201d Something he\u2019d never thought to see his maker doing. He would\u2019ve taken a picture and loaded it onto YouTube if he hadn\u2019t thought that Zareb would kill him.</p><p>Ethan had stopped to pull a hoodie from the closet. His change was almost complete. From this moment until the Second One retreated, Cassie couldn\u2019t see his face. He pulled the hood far enough forward so he was hidden in shadow. On the way out, he picked up his sunglasses.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThe Second One?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Then they left. Cassie didn\u2019t say anything until they were in her car. \u201cNo one waited for us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet up near Eternal Rest. They\u2019ll all come in their own cars. They\u2019ll park a few blocks away and wait for Zareb to give instructions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCars?\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I thought vampires would have a sexier way of getting around than that. I know you don\u2019t do the dematerializing thing, but how about flying? Do vampires fly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ethan knew she was trying to sound calm, but he could hear her quickened heartbeat, sense her tension. \u201cIf we could do all the things myths say we can do, we\u2019d have conquered the world centuries ago. We have preternatural speed and strength, enhanced senses, and our own specific gifts. And if you belong to my bloodline, you have the Second One.\u201d</p> <p>She remained silent for a few minutes, and Ethan was hopeful that she\u2019d run out of questions. She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI was in the shower when you explained things to Zareb. So how did you end up in that glass coffin? And please tell me what a binder is?\u201d</p><p>He kept his attention on the road. He didn\u2019t want to repeat the story, but she had a right to know. \u201cI was in Jersey when they caught me.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t go into details about the chase, about how the hell they even found him. \u201cThey shot me up with something to keep me weak until they got back to Eternal Rest. Then they took my clothes and dumped me into the coffin. I was still too weak to do anything when the binder came in with his freaking headstone.\u201d Where had they found someone like him?</p><p>\u201cThey? Who are \u2018they\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Some kind of hunters.\u201d Human, but not human. And they\u2019d brought beasts with them. His mind skittered away from thoughts of the beasts.</p> <p>\u201cSo explain \u2018binder.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Ethan could feel her gaze on him, but he didn\u2019t turn to glance at her. He couldn\u2019t take the chance that she\u2019d see his face. \u201cA binding spell bends someone to your will, makes them do what you want them to do.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen or felt anything like this. Tony brought in his headstone, set it next to me, and suddenly I couldn\u2019t move a muscle. I was like that for days.\u201d He\u2019d fought, tried to at least twitch. Nothing. He was a mind trapped in a useless body. He\u2019d never admit how terrified he was. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Garrity found someone that powerful.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cThe etching on the tombstone showed you wrapped in chains and a lock on the coffin. So he made you feel exactly what his drawing depicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why they wanted me, or why they put me in a glass coffin. I need answers.\u201d He hoped he would get those answers tonight.</p><p>Even though Ethan suspected that Cassie had more questions, she stayed silent for the rest of the drive. He parked her car three blocks from the funeral home. His car was still in Jersey. At least he hoped it was.</p><p>Once out of the car, Ethan moved close to her. Her emotions touched him\u2014fear, sorrow, anger, determination. He\u2019d tried to stay clear of the feelings of others in the past. Nothing good came from allowing yourself to be sucked into the maelstrom of human emotions. Involvement made you careless, vulnerable.</p> <p>He recognized the risks. But this time he couldn\u2019t resist. Ethan wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her close. \u201cWhatever goes down when we get there, Zareb will want me to go in first because I have the big guns tonight. He\u2019ll follow me in. He\u2019ll choose a few others to go in with us. The rest will stay outside to deal with guards or anyone trying to flee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Her expression said that if they planned to tuck her safely behind some tree, they could just forget about it.</p><p>\u201cI want you between Zareb and me. It\u2019ll be the safest place. You know what I can do. And Zareb is old enough to remember the pharaohs. Hell, he might\u2019ve been one. He has crazy survival skills.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her whole body tense.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help himself, Ethan reached over with his free hand and slid his fingers along her clenched jaw. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Stupid words. They\u2019d mean nothing to her.</p><p>She drew a deep shuddering breath and relaxed into him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>And that one word made him feel . . . good. No matter what they\u2019d find when they reached Garrity\u2019s, or how much the Second One\u2019s need for violence pushed at him, right now, with her human warmth pressed against his side, he was content. Not a word anyone would use to describe him.</p><p>Ethan stilled as he felt the familiar touch in his mind. Zareb could get into his brain without Ethan even knowing he was there, but his maker always announced his presence as a courtesy.</p> <p>Ethan listened to Zareb\u2019s message and then spoke to Cassie. He made sure he didn\u2019t look at her as he talked. \u201cZareb just did some mental messaging. He\u2019s already at Eternal Rest. Armed guards are scattered around the place. People are moving things out in a hurry. Guess they figure they might get company. He\u2019s not going for sneaky. As soon as we get there, we\u2019ll go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d survive a long wait.\u201d She paused. \u201cCan all vampires read minds?\u201d</p><p>He slowed down a little as they got closer to the funeral home, his senses alive to any enemy who might be nearby. \u201cMost can read human minds, but nonhuman minds are tougher. A maker is always able to access the minds of those he created.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWell, at least you didn\u2019t shatter all of my illusions about the children of the night.\u201d Cassie stared into the darkness. \u201cWe must be close.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She opened her purse and rested her hand on the gun inside.</p><p>Ethan leaned down until he could whisper in her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe tonight. Trust me?\u201d Stupid question. He was a vampire.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He released her and beckoned her deeper into the shadows. He put his finger to his lips. They crept from building to building until they finally worked their way around to the back of Eternal Rest.</p><p>Zareb glided from the darkness. Ethan could see the silhouettes of the four other vampires who would go inside with them. He only hoped crazy Darren wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Zareb\u2019s whisper was brief. \u201cEthan, Cassie, and I will go in the back door. The rest of you will go around to the front. If everyone else did their jobs, the outside guards should be gone by now.\u201d Zareb watched the other vampires fade into the night. He avoided meeting Ethan\u2019s gaze as he nodded at him. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He didn\u2019t even glance at Cassie. \u201cOh, and the door\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>Ethan turned his head away as he spoke to her. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to kill.\u201d He took his place in front of her and faced the back door. \u201cAnd whatever you do, don\u2019t look at my face.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the hoodie from his head, took off his glasses and shoved them into a pocket, then lifted his foot and kicked in the door.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>No plan? Just kick down the door and wing it? Where was the damn plan? Cassie\u2019s heart was beating so fast she thought it might explode from her chest. That would pretty much put a kink in their covert action. Covert? Hah.</p><p>She gripped her gun as she wondered how Zareb would even know if his outside vampires had gotten rid of all the guards. No sounds of a struggle, no screams, no grunts or triumphant whoops. Cassie didn\u2019t want to think about fanged shadows moving silently through the night.</p><p>Then she remembered what Ethan had said about a vampire\u2019s power to read thoughts. Zareb would be connected mentally to all of his children. He was probably in her mind right now too.</p><p>A soft chuckle from behind Cassie shivered up her spine.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I not be there? Your mind is a delight, Cassie.\u201d Zareb\u2019s whisper seemed way too close. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m in everyone else\u2019s mind as well, even the enemy\u2019s. My only limit is distance.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself not to respond. Instead, she stared at Ethan\u2019s back as he strode down the hallway. He was all power and smooth deadly grace. And even in the midst of her panic attack, his presence did weird things to her nervous system.</p><p>Zareb spoke softly. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, four of them are heading our way right now, and they\u2019re extremely pissed off.\u201d</p><p>The sound of running footsteps snapped her attention back to the hallway. Four men rushed toward them, guns in one hand and swords in the other. Swords? Really? They looked human to her\u2014no fangs when they snarled\u2014but they moved faster than a human would. What were they?</p><p>The need for action was almost a relief. Cassie pulled her gun from her purse. But she needn\u2019t have bothered.</p><p>Ethan waited. The men facing him slid to a stop and then just stared. They dropped their weapons. Their expressions slowly shifted from fury to something so creepy that it made Cassie shiver. They looked as though they were in some sort of ecstatic trance\u2014eyes half closed, mouths twisted in grotesque travesties of smiles. They stayed frozen like that while she held her breath. Then they simply collapsed. She exhaled. She recognized death in their loose-limbed sprawl.</p><p>Don\u2019t shake, don\u2019t shake. Whatever those men had seen in their last moments had killed them. For the first time, the Second One became real. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut they died happy. How many of us will be able to say that?\u201d Zareb\u2019s voice in her head sounded mildly amused.</p><p>Cassie tried to control her horror. She\u2019d seen enough violent death today to fill several lifetimes. Zareb\u2019s attitude shouldn\u2019t shock her. But it did.</p><p>\u201cWhen you live thousands of years, Cassie, death becomes an old friend.\u201d Zareb spoke aloud as he watched the vampires he\u2019d sent around to the front entrance coming toward them.</p> <p>Ethan pulled his hoodie over his head again. He hadn\u2019t spoken or looked at them since they\u2019d entered Eternal Rest.</p><p>Cassie couldn\u2019t stop the questions flooding her mind. If the Second One was in control, did it recognize her? Did it care about any of them? The thought of a cold emotionless entity crouching inside Ethan\u2019s body not only terrified her but also made her incredibly sad. She forced her gaze from him.</p><p>Zareb didn\u2019t ask the others if they\u2019d cleared the front of the building. The fact that they were standing here proved they had.</p><p>Cassie tried not to stare at the bodies. \u201cThose were humans, weren\u2019t they? Then how were they able to move like vampires?\u201d</p><p>Zareb looked thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I intend to find out.\u201d He walked to Ethan\u2019s side. \u201cWhat do you think about getting into the basement?\u201d</p> <p>Ethan kept his head turned away. \u201cIf anyone is down there, they can nail us as we get off the elevator. Let\u2019s look outside. They wouldn\u2019t want to get trapped with just one exit. I\u2019m betting on a trapdoor and stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Cassie held up her hand. \u201cWhen I used the elevator, there were three buttons. The top one was ground level. I hit the bottom one and it took me to where Ethan was being kept. But there was a second button in between the other two.\u201d</p><p>Zareb nodded. \u201cThe place probably has a sub-basement.\u201d He looked at the vampires who\u2019d entered by the front door. \u201cTwo of you stay here to stop anyone coming up on the elevator. The other two check out the second button. When I call for you, come down to the bottom floor.\u201d Then he waved for Ethan and her to follow him.</p><p>Once outside, Cassie stayed close to Ethan\u2019s back. The darkness closed around her. The brave words she\u2019d spouted to Ethan were all lies. Fear was a scalding acid eating its way through her. Her legs shook, but she forced herself to keep going. She owed this to Felicity.</p><p>Ethan worked his way around the house, his gaze fixed on the ground. She couldn\u2019t see anything but grass in the darkness. Finally, he stopped. He bent down and lifted a large square of what must be fake lawn. It looked exactly like the rest of the lawn to Cassie.</p><p>Then everything happened almost too fast for her to follow. Zareb stepped around her and carefully raised the trapdoor hidden beneath the grass. It didn\u2019t make a sound. Light spilled from the opening, revealing stairs. He stood aside so Ethan could descend first.</p> <p>Once again Zareb was in her mind. \u201cStay out of the way. I\u2019ve called the others down. We have to do this fast and get out of here. Reinforcements will be on the way.\u201d Then he leaped down the steps in a blur of motion.</p><p>No way would Cassie be left standing by herself in the dark. She took a deep breath. Oh, what the hell. She pulled the knife from its sheath and the gun from her purse. With a weapon in each hand, she admitted that her grandfather had done one thing right. He\u2019d taught her to be comfortable fighting with either hand.</p><p>Cautiously, she followed the two vampires. There was no need for quiet, because as soon as Ethan and Zareb hit the basement floor, shouts and gunshots exploded.</p><p>Just as she took the last step down, silence fell. Cassie suspected what she\u2019d find when she looked around.</p><p>Six humans\u2014at least she assumed they were human\u2014were caught in the Second One\u2019s deadly web.</p><p>Zareb was busy in the corner of the room where three glass coffins rested on gurneys. A naked man lay inside each of the coffins. She shuddered. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. There were no signs of any headstones. She\u2019d bet that the six men had been getting ready to move the coffins out of Eternal Rest.</p><p>Cassie turned her attention to Ethan. She didn\u2019t hear the man silently descending the stairs behind her until he shoved her to the floor. She fell to one knee and lost her grip on the gun. It slid under a nearby cabinet.</p><p>Cassie looked up in time to see the man step behind Ethan. He raised the sword he carried over his head.</p> <p>Ethan\u2019s attention was focused on the men in front of him. Even as she watched, the men started to collapse. Zareb was turned toward the coffins.</p><p>With no conscious thought, just the lessons drilled into her by the man she\u2019d called Grandfather, Cassie raised her knife in one smooth motion and threw it. If her target was human, he was dead, because the knife was buried to the hilt in the left side of his back.</p><p>He fell and his sword clattered to the floor.</p><p>She might never have wanted to see or think about her grandfather again, but right now she was glad she hadn\u2019t stopped practicing with weapons. Cassie had promised herself that she\u2019d never be a victim again.</p><p>She stood up, unable to look away from the body of the man she\u2019d killed. Bodies, so many damn bodies. She tried to close her eyes, but she couldn\u2019t blink, couldn\u2019t turn from the man.</p><p>Luckily, others were capable of movement. Ethan put on his sunglasses and yanked his hoodie over his head before turning around. He took in the situation at a glance. He didn\u2019t get a chance to say anything because at that moment, the four vampires that Zareb had left above burst from the elevator.</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t rush over to help the others get the men out of their coffins. He moved to Cassie\u2019s side, still keeping his face turned from her. He didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>She needed him now\u2014his strength, his solid presence standing between her and the body of the one who would always be her dead man, between her and the six bodies sprawled in the middle of the room. She knew she was swaying. But she didn\u2019t move toward him, didn\u2019t know how to relate to the Second One, wasn\u2019t sure she even could.</p><p>And just when she thought she\u2019d turn and run screaming up the stairs, Ethan moved. He simply took her hand and pulled her against him.</p><p>His words were almost a whisper. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all. But that\u2019s all she needed. Those had been Ethan\u2019s words. And if she was wrong, then she\u2019d just hold on to her illusions.</p><p>Zareb moved quickly toward them along with the rest of his vampires, who were holding up the three semiconscious men they\u2019d rescued. \u201cWe have to get out of here. I sense others coming. This isn\u2019t the time for a stand.\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t argue as he scooped her into his arms and then moved with preternatural speed. They were a blur as they all rushed up the stairs and into the darkness. Once hidden by the night, Ethan set her down.</p><p>Zareb allowed the others to scatter, but put up his hand to signal that Ethan and Cassie should wait. \u201cI\u2019ll destroy Eternal Rest before I leave. You head home.\u201d</p><p>Before his words could even sink in, the funeral home exploded in flames. Cassie only had a moment to be thankful that no other buildings were close by, and then Ethan dragged her away.</p><p>Zareb disappeared in the opposite direction.</p><p>Cassie remained silent as Ethan drove. She was tired all the way to her soul, but she knew sleep would be tough tonight. If she\u2019d thought that seeing lots of bodies would desensitize her, she was wrong. She\u2019d killed two men today. They would follow her into her dreams and beyond.</p><p>Ethan spoke just before they reached Zareb\u2019s place. \u201cThose three vampires are the friends who were staying with me.\u201d He allowed the silence to build. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that we reached them before Garrity\u2019s new binder did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the binder had already put the headstones by them, would destroying the headstones have broken the binding?\u201d Nightmares or not, she needed sleep so that she could think clearly. Right now everything was just a tangled web of confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get a good look at me when I was in that coffin. If you had, you would\u2019ve noticed the same scene that was on my headstone burned into my chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just sick.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWait, I saw you right after you escaped from the coffin, and all you had were cuts from the glass.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNo one burned that into me. It just appeared at the same time the binder put the headstone next to my coffin. At the moment he died, the image disappeared from my chest. I think that even if someone had destroyed the headstone, as long as the binder was still alive, the image would have stayed on my body.\u201d He seemed to think for a moment. \u201cAnd the binding would have held.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t have time to comment on that because they\u2019d reached Zareb\u2019s warehouse. She climbed from the car and headed for the door. Ethan put his hand on her arm to stop her.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you how amazing you were back there. I\u2019d have gone to my final death tonight if you hadn\u2019t thrown that knife.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see his face, but she sensed his smile.</p><p>\u201cZareb has a talent for reading what\u2019s inside a person, knowing how to get the most from them. I know why he let you come with us. I think he knew that you were capable of performing \u2018extraordinary feats.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie didn\u2019t want to be pleased. Killing a person shouldn\u2019t make anyone feel proud. But it wasn\u2019t the killing that brought her a sense of wonder. It was the fact that subconsciously she\u2019d known that she couldn\u2019t allow this man to die.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She took a deep breath and asked the question that had nagged at her all night. \u201cYou sound normal. Why aren\u2019t you all primitive rage and savagery with the Second One in control?\u201d</p><p>She could feel his gaze\u2014hot, disturbing.</p> <p>\u201cExactly because the Second One is a primitive force. It only has one focus\u2014violence. When it doesn\u2019t have a target, it subsides.\u201d He paused. \u201cBut it\u2019s still there, waiting for the moment it senses anger or any emotion it can hook its claws into. I have to be careful until it fades. Oh, and my face will still kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long until it\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot for a while now. I killed again tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cassie swallowed hard. She should leave now, walk into the building, because his closeness was making her forget things she needed to remember\u2014he was a vampire, he had killed ten men tonight, he was a vampire.</p><p>But her feet didn\u2019t move. Everything that had happened today, every moment of emotional turmoil was breaking like waves against the dam she\u2019d erected in her mind. And the dam had sprung leaks. Lots of them.</p> <p>Even as she took the step toward him that she knew would change everything, the dam collapsed and her emotions swept her away.</p><p>If she thought he\u2019d be the one to wield some common sense, she was wrong. With a guttural groan, he pulled her to him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do this to me when the Second One is around. It doesn\u2019t understand limits.\u201d</p><p>Cassie closed her eyes as she reached up to trace his jaw with shaking fingers. \u201cBring it on. It seems I\u2019m into expanding my limits today. I\u2019m willing to live dangerously for a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>And with a muffled curse, he covered her mouth with his.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>There were moments when people did things they never thought they\u2019d do. This was one of them. She would kiss a vampire.</p><p>It was her in-between time\u2014after Felicity\u2019s death, after she\u2019d killed two men, but before the dreaded instant when she\u2019d have to finally accept that everything she\u2019d experienced today was real. And definitely before she lay alone in her bed and slept, only to live it all again in her dreams.</p><p>This was her moment to forget\u2014no before, no after, just now. And what a now it was. Ethan wouldn\u2019t kiss her gently. Not with the Second One lurking so close to the surface. But that was okay, because she didn\u2019t want kind and understanding right now. She wanted a kiss that would obliterate her memories of the day.</p><p>He pulled her to him, and she savored the anticipation. He was sexy, masculine, and warm. Who knew a vampire could feel warm? His lips moved over hers\u2014no attempt at seduction, just all hard demand. And she opened to him.</p><p>Let the sensations begin. Or not. Because something strange was happening. She\u2019d prepared herself to absorb the scent, the feel, the taste of him. That\u2019s what you did when you kissed someone. But instead, she fell straight through the hole that must\u2019ve been in the bottom of her box of sensations and hurtled into . . .</p><p>What the . . . ? Darkness, heat, and emotions so strong that they shook her. No up, no down, just feelings\u2014stomach-churning desire and a need that clawed her bloody inside. She was moving too fast, gasping for breath as everything gathering inside her expanded, threatening to fill her universe.</p><p>Every once in a while she\u2019d catch a glimpse of reality in a flash of light seen out of the corner of her mind\u2019s eye\u2014his tongue stroking and tasting, his lips sensual and tempting. But then it would be gone.</p><p>Emotions. So many of them. All struggling to be acknowledged, to be felt. Finally she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. It was too much, too unexpected, too frightening. What the hell was happening? She opened her eyes.</p> <p>For one terrifying second she stared into the reflection of herself in his glasses\u2014wide-eyed, confused, scared. And then he turned his head away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me when the Second One is near. Not even if I\u2019m wearing the glasses.\u201d His voice was a raspy warning. \u201cUnless you have a death wish.\u201d He released her and stepped back.</p><p>Cassie swayed, not sure if she was about to humiliate herself by falling flat on her face. Taking a deep breath, she locked her knees and stood tall. It had just been a kiss. Right. Way to lie to yourself.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Any of it. Not what he was or why one kiss felt as though he\u2019d changed her on a molecular level.</p><p>\u201cI explained before. You stare at my face and the Second One notices. It wants me to chuck the glasses so that it can reach you through my eyes. It wants to kill you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIf it catches me at a weak moment, I\u2019ll take them off.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d misunderstood her, but that was okay. Her reaction to his kiss was too raw, and examining it would hurt.</p><p>\u201cWe need to go.\u201d He sounded angry.</p><p>What did he have to be mad about? She was the one who had just discovered a whole new weird world inside her. Since Cassie didn\u2019t trust herself to speak rationally, she simply nodded and followed him.</p><p>Zareb waited for them in his living room along with the three rescued vampires. He sat in a leather recliner, and the cat lay in his lap purring as Zareb idly stroked it. He speared Ethan with a hard stare.</p><p>\u201cIt took you long enough to get in here.\u201d Zareb\u2019s expression said he knew exactly why they\u2019d made him wait. \u201cYour friends will be staying here along with you and Cassie until we find our favorite undertaker and fit him for one of his own coffins. The bastards won\u2019t get through my defenses.\u201d</p><p>Left unsaid was that Ethan had been woefully negligent in not erecting a twenty-foot impenetrable wall around his house. Cassie noticed that Ethan didn\u2019t argue about their staying with Zareb, so this place must be safe. And Cassie was all about staying safe right now.</p><p>\u201cHow much do we know?\u201d Even as he spoke, Ethan stepped into a shadowed corner.</p><p>Cassie had to sit down before she fell down. The memory of what forever after would be known as The Kiss, along with everything else that had happened today, was finally taking its toll on her.</p><p>The three rescued vampires sat on the couch. They still looked groggy. After removing the knife sheath and dropping it to the floor beside her, she collapsed onto the only chair left. Cassie still clutched her purse with the gun inside. She never wanted to be without a weapon again.</p><p>\u201cWe still know almost nothing. Perhaps when their heads clear we\u2019ll learn more.\u201d Zareb glanced at the vampires on the couch as though he could force them into coherency by his will alone.</p><p>After being around him for a while, Cassie was almost willing to believe he could. \u201cHow were they captured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been mumbling something about humans that moved too fast and creatures like nothing they\u2019d ever seen before.\u201d Zareb glanced at Ethan and Cassie. \u201cAnything to add?\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. \u201cThe humans that ran at us in the hallway moved like vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe creatures they brought with them to capture me looked like someone had taken parts from different animals and glued them together.\u201d Ethan spoke from the shadows.</p><p>One of the vampires on the couch continued in a monotone. \u201cBig hairy bodies. Claws like some prehistoric raptor. Fangs of a freaking saber-toothed tiger and . . .\u201d He paused before going on. \u201cAnd the eyes of a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Zareb frowned. \u201cDisturbing.\u201d</p><p>Another vampire joined in. \u201cThe creatures didn\u2019t maul us much, just helped to subdue us so the human bastards could shoot us up with something that knocked us out.\u201d He peered at Ethan and then at Cassie. He offered her a lopsided grin and a wink. \u201cYou look too good for Ethan. I\u2019m Stark. When you dump his ass, look me up.\u201d</p><p>Cassie swallowed her laughter. Now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>The last vampire on the couch finally spoke up. \u201cI heard one of the humans promise to reward the creatures when they visited the neighbors.\u201d</p><p>Cassie remembered the torn bodies and shuddered.</p><p>\u201cHow did they get to Ethan\u2019s house? I doubt they could parade their furry friends through the streets without anyone noticing.\u201d Zareb stopped stroking the cat. It hissed its displeasure but didn\u2019t leave his lap.</p><p>\u201cA truck? They could\u2019ve parked behind the house and gotten them inside without anyone noticing once it got dark.\u201d Ethan sounded as though he was ready for the conversation to be over.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they capturing vampires and putting them in glass coffins? And what did my friend Felicity know that got her killed?\u201d Cassie\u2019s lids kept sliding shut.</p><p>They all thought about her questions in silence for a few minutes. None of them offered answers.</p><p>Zareb finally stood. He set the cat gently on the floor before facing his guests. \u201cI have one thing to add. I was in the minds of the humans down in the basement before Ethan short-circuited their brains. One of them was thinking about someone called the Collector. I got the impression that this Collector was the boss, and that he wasn\u2019t Garrity.\u201d He motioned for the three vampires on the couch to follow him. \u201cI\u2019ll show you your rooms.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She thought about mentioning that no one had introduced her to the other two vampires, but she was too tired to care. \u201cWhere will Ethan and I sleep?\u201d Cassie didn\u2019t want to think about the nightmares waiting for her tonight, but she couldn\u2019t stay awake much longer.</p><p>Zareb paused. \u201cI only have one guestroom left. It\u2019s the one Ethan used when I first turned him. You can share it with him.\u201d His smile said he knew his choice would upset her, but he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>Cassie narrowed her eyes and pressed her lips together to keep from shouting at Zareb. He\u2019d enjoy it too much. Instead she turned to Ethan. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the couch.\u201d</p> <p>Zareb didn\u2019t even turn. He threw back over his shoulder, \u201cCan\u2019t. It\u2019s a sofa bed and I\u2019m sleeping on it. I wouldn\u2019t usually give up my own bed to guests, but I want to be the one closest to the door if trouble comes calling. My three friends here are still a little loopy and Ethan\u2019s Second One would overreact. You? You\u2019re only a human. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sorry. She watched the cat leap onto the couch. It lay down and watched her from half-closed eyes. Cassie recognized the self-satisfied feline smirk it wore. The damn cat would get to sleep on the couch while she\u2019d be sleeping . . . She glanced at the floor. Maybe with a few blankets and a comfy pillow it wouldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ethan emerged from the shadows, his hoodie and glasses still in place. \u201cWe can share my bed. It\u2019s not far from dawn, so you don\u2019t have to worry about me staying awake looking for my chance to pounce on you.\u201d He strode past her, headed for the hallway.</p><p>And because she was so exhausted that her brain felt scrambled, she followed him.</p><p>He opened the door at the end of the hallway and stepped aside for her to enter. She had a vague impression of a large space, a massive four-poster bed, and furniture scattered around the room that looked as though it belonged in some ancient castle. No windows.</p> <p>\u201cThis was originally Zareb\u2019s room. He wanted to re-create the special feel of that last great castle he conquered.\u201d Ethan laughed softly. \u201cThe one with the throne and the willing widow. My maker can be a nostalgic bastard.\u201d</p><p>Cassie stared at him stupidly. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then Zareb decided he had to move into the modern era. His present room is metal and glass along with a big-screen TV that takes up a whole wall.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give a damn about Zareb. \u201cShower.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t really need a shower. Her last adventure at Eternal Rest had been a bloodless one. Ethan\u2019s kills were terrifyingly tidy and her knife had produced no splatter. She could skip the shower. But even though there was no physical evidence of death, she still needed to wash the feel of it from her body. Yes, it was all in her mind, but right now her mind was running the show.</p><p>While she stood in the middle of his room and tried to keep her eyes open, he disappeared, only to appear a few seconds later with a nightgown and robe. Where had he . . . ? Then she remembered. The hall closet with all the extra clothes. When she turned to go back out the door to reach the hall bathroom, he stopped her.</p> <p>\u201cThe room has its own bathroom.\u201d He pointed to a door in the far wall.</p><p>A few minutes later, Cassie stepped into Zareb\u2019s glorious shower. It could hold a small army. She made the spray hot enough to peel the skin from her body and then scrubbed and scrubbed. When she finished, she turned off the water and sank onto the stone ledge for a short rest. Yes, she was putting off the moment when she\u2019d have to go back into the bedroom and face Ethan. She closed her eyes. It would only be for . . .</p><p>When she opened her eyes again, she was lying in bed staring at the clock on the nightstand next to her. Almost noon. She turned her head. Their bed.</p><p>Ethan lay on his back next to her. Asleep.</p><p>How . . . ? The last thing she remembered was sitting on the ledge in the shower. Ohmigod, she\u2019d conked out. He must have gotten her out of the shower, dried her, and pulled on her nightgown. Then he would have had to carry her to the bed. How had she slept through all of that? The wet and naked part made her feel a little warm. Memories of the The Kiss tugged at her.</p><p>He wore a sleep mask, but no hoodie. She dared to look. After all, if he slept, then the Second One probably did too.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s face left her breathless. Even without being able to see his eyes, she felt the inexorable pull that the Second One\u2019s victims must feel. But at least she was able\u2014with superhuman strength\u2014to drag her gaze from that full lower lip, the lines and planes of a face that would bring humans to their knees in the streets if he chose to mingle.</p><p>She shifted her gaze lower. He\u2019d pushed the covers down to his waist, exposing sculpted arms and a muscular torso that made her swallow hard. Sure, she\u2019d seen it all before in Garrity\u2019s basement, but this was the first time she\u2019d had time to appreciate it. Cassie bit her lip, focusing on the pain to stop herself from reaching out to touch, to smooth, to rip the damn covers off to see if he slept naked.</p> <p>Taking a deep calming breath, she wondered how she\u2019d survive another night sharing his bed. Because only total exhaustion had kept her from lying awake thinking about him next to her.</p><p>But then she remembered Felicity. She hadn\u2019t dreamed about her friend last night. She must have been too tired to dream. But the nightmares would come. And she didn\u2019t want to be sleeping in this bed when she woke screaming.</p><p>She climbed from the bed. No need to tiptoe around. Ethan was deep in his day sleep. And if legends were to be believed, the place could collapse around him and he wouldn\u2019t wake. Throwing on her robe, she went in search of coffee.</p><p>Cassie was lost in thought about Felicity as she walked into Zareb\u2019s kitchen. What would her friend\u2019s family think when they found out that she\u2019d just disappeared? Felicity had never talked much about her family, and Cassie had never met them.</p><p>Her frustration grew. She couldn\u2019t contact them, couldn\u2019t tell them the truth. And what about her own family? When she finally called them, she\u2019d have to pretend that everything was fine. She hated lying.</p><p>All thoughts came to a sudden halt, though, when Cassie looked up and saw two massive men standing by the sink. She couldn\u2019t control a startled yelp.</p><p>They didn\u2019t smile. Jeez, they both had to be at least six feet five with muscular everything. They must be brothers\u2014same size, same hard features, same orangey hair and strange amber eyes.</p><p>She froze. Who were they? If they were the enemy, then she was screwed because a houseful of sleeping vampires wouldn\u2019t be much protection.</p><p>Her weapon. She\u2019d left her gun in her purse. The purse was still in the bedroom. Memo to self: gun goes everywhere, even to the bathroom.</p><p>No one spoke, so she finally broke the silence. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>The one on the right answered. \u201cI\u2019m Ben and this is my brother Todd. Zareb hired us to guard the place during the day. You\u2019re the human.\u201d He still didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>You\u2019re the human. That must mean that he wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>The other man, Todd, finally smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones strong enough to keep you safe, little girl. Maybe you\u2019d better hope you never have to find out what we are.\u201d</p><p>Well, that solved that. Little girl? Jerk. At least they\u2019d cooked breakfast. \u201cDo you mind if I steal something to eat and some coffee?\u201d</p><p>Todd shrugged and picked up the conversation with his brother that she must have interrupted. Sports.</p><p>She tuned them out. No way did she want to spend any quality time around these two. Cassie piled bacon, scrambled eggs, and a piece of toast on a plate, then poured a cup of coffee. She carried all of her food back to the bedroom. A sleeping Ethan made a better companion than they did.</p><p>She set her food and coffee on a small table tucked into the corner of the room and sat down to eat. Then she noticed that the cat had slunk in behind her. She\u2019d leaped onto the bed and promptly curled up at the foot of it.</p><p>Cassie smiled. \u201cWe agree on something, cat.\u201d</p><p>She stopped smiling as she slid her gaze the length of as much of Ethan\u2019s body as she could see. Then she looked at that breathtaking face. Not too long at one time. Just a glance here and a glance there.</p><p>Finally she accepted the truth. She couldn\u2019t sleep next to Ethan for another night. The attraction was too strong, her sensual thoughts too potent, and her willpower almost nonexistent. If she was lucky, they\u2019d locate Garrity tonight and she could find somewhere else to stay.</p><p>Cassie forced herself to turn her back on Ethan and stare at the wall. She thought about the horrors of yesterday, grounded herself in what was important, and tried to ignore the vampire in her bed.</p><p>No, she definitely wasn\u2019t spending another night sleeping next to him.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The sixth night.</p><p>For five nights she\u2019d lain alone in their bed with her eyes closed so he wouldn\u2019t know that she was still awake when he finally returned. Forget sleep. She couldn\u2019t relax until she was sure Ethan had gotten home safely before dawn.</p><p>For five mornings she\u2019d lain awake gazing at his face\u2014and when the sheet gods smiled on her, his body\u2014before falling into an uneasy and nightmare-ridden sleep herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least she could stare her fill, because the Second One had faded almost completely. It was the almost that bothered her. She could see the tiny changes the Second One had left behind, the ones that were part of him now\u2014his slightly fuller lower lip, eyes that seemed a little larger, a little more beautiful than before. Cassie tried not to dwell on the consequences if he continued to kill.</p><p>For five days she\u2019d gotten up and dressed right before dusk and then waited for him to awaken.</p><p>That had been the best time of the day because he\u2019d had time to talk with her. A lot. He\u2019d explained how they were making a systematic search of the city. Until Garrity was eliminated, she had to stay hidden. She\u2019d reminded him that she was the one who had saved his vampire butt at Eternal Rest. He was grateful, but no, she couldn\u2019t hunt with them. Arguments ensued. She\u2019d enjoyed them a little too much.</p> <p>And they\u2019d spoken about other stuff. About his human life as a horse trainer and how he sometimes still went for night rides. About her life as a consultant, a life that seemed to grow more distant and unreal as the week progressed.</p><p>Cassie had also unburdened herself about emotions she normally would\u2019ve felt hesitant to share\u2014her memories of Felicity, feelings about her grandfather she\u2019d bottled up inside for a very long time, and her attacks of conscience over the men she\u2019d killed.</p><p>But most important of all were the things they didn\u2019t talk about. How she came alive when he was near. How the need to touch him became a driving obsession as the days passed. How she knew if he disappeared from her life tonight she\u2019d mourn his loss for a long time. And how sometimes she caught him staring at her with an intensity that made her catch her breath, made her weak with need.</p><p>Tonight was the sixth night. Tonight would be different.</p><p>She heard the door open. Cassie didn\u2019t hear him enter. She never did. He moved so silently that she didn\u2019t know he was in the shower until she heard the water running.</p> <p>She pushed aside her usual fantasy, the one where she watched the warm water sluice over his powerful back, thighs, and perfect tight butt. The one where she moved up behind him and molded her bare body to all that heat and smooth wet flesh.</p><p>Tonight would be different. She opened her eyes.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity, Cassie saw the bathroom door open. She watched him move quietly across the room, his face in shadow. When he reached the bed, she saw that he wore his sunglasses.</p><p>He\u2019d killed. She almost closed her eyes. Almost. But she wouldn\u2019t allow the Second One to destroy her hopes tonight.</p><p>She felt him slide into bed. He was naked.</p><p>Ethan broke the silence. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been awake every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that shocked her. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heartbeat. It was too fast for normal sleep.\u201d He rolled onto his side facing her. \u201cI stayed awake listening to it every night until the day sleep took me.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his face from the corner of her eye and then away. \u201cI never knew.\u201d Now that the moment was here, Cassie fumbled for words. \u201cI watched you sleep. In the morning.\u201d Fine. Now he\u2019d think she was some kind of creepy voyeur.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you think about while you watched me, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>His voice was deep dark chocolate coating all of the desires she\u2019d kept carefully hidden for the past five nights. Now was the time for truth.</p><p>\u201cI thought about making love with you.\u201d She held her breath. Only desperation would drive her to say those words. What if he didn\u2019t feel the same way? After all, he\u2019d had five nights to make his move if he was interested. What if\u2014</p> <p>His soft laughter wrapped her in warmth. \u201cGood. I wouldn\u2019t have made a seventh night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d Do something? She turned on her side to face him, careful not to focus on his face for too long.</p><p>He reached out to touch her then, just a slide of his fingers along her jaw. But that simple touch amplified her needs, sent them crawling along her nerve endings, awakened her in ways she\u2019d never imagined. Something exciting and new opened its eyes for the first time and blinked in the bright light of her anticipation.</p><p>\u201cYou kept your eyes closed. No matter what you thought you wanted, Cassie, you weren\u2019t ready to see me yet.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cThe real me. Acceptance comes from in here.\u201d He tapped one finger over her heart.</p><p>That tap felt like the boom of a kettledrum and her heart leaped in response. \u201cAre we finished with the deep stuff yet?\u201d Her breaths were coming faster. When had she grown into an impatient bitch? About six nights ago.</p><p>His smile was a flash of white in the darkness. Without answering, he pushed himself to his knees and leaned over her. \u201cSit up.\u201d</p><p>Now that she\u2019d exhausted her supply of bravado for the night, she simply obeyed. Raising her arms, she allowed him to slip her nightgown over her head while she focused on his throat and the pulse that beat there.</p><p>Cassie looked up to find him staring at her, and she swore she could see his eyes gleaming behind the dark lenses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I thought that from the first moment I saw you.\u201d He lowered his head to kiss a path starting at the sensitive skin beneath her ear and continuing down her neck.</p><p>Cassie closed her eyes and murmured her pleasure.</p><p>She felt him pause at the hollow of her throat, his lips all heat and pressure. Cassie swallowed hard and knew he\u2019d feel it. \u201cFrom the first moment? I don\u2019t think so. Your eyes were black and you were flashing fangs.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment as he slid his tongue along her collarbone, then kissed the swell of her breast. \u201cI compartmentalize my emotions well. My rage was completely separate from my appreciation of you.\u201d</p><p>She was finding it hard to concentrate. To ground herself, she smoothed her fingers over his broad shoulders and along his biceps. His muscles tensed beneath her touch.</p><p>This time the sensations came. His scent\u2014clean, male, and filled with memories of the night. His skin, smooth and warm. His taste? She\u2019d find out.</p><p>But as she leaned in to kiss him, he put his hands on her shoulders and took her down to the bed with him. Then he rolled her onto her back and straddled her hips. \u201cThere. That\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Cassie forgot not to look. She opened her eyes and glared up at him. \u201cExcuse me? Where\u2019s the equal access? You can reach everything. I can only reach . . . some things.\u201d She took a deep breath and dropped her gaze.</p><p>\u201cAh, but they\u2019re the important things.\u201d</p><p>He tangled his fingers in her hair and leaned down to cover her mouth with his. Cassie explored the taste of him fully as the long drugging kiss threatened to spiral out of control. She closed her eyes again as she traced each fang with the tip of her tongue. So different from her, but so right for him.</p><p>He finally broke the kiss in favor of focusing his attention on her breasts. And as he circled her nipple with the tip of his tongue and then covered it with his lips, she encouraged him with breathy moans.</p><p>The heat of his mouth, the way he flicked each nipple with his tongue before nipping gently, and the pleasure/pain as he drew on it made her gasp.</p><p>Pleasure drove her. Cassie arched her back as he licked a path over her stomach. Then she spread her legs when he moved lower to trail the tip of his tongue up her inner thigh.</p><p>But when he slid his hands under her bottom, lifted her to meet his mouth, and then used that same tongue tip to tease the sensitive nub that was control central for what seemed to be every nerve ending in her body, she took a dive into the same place she\u2019d visited the first time they\u2019d kissed.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d Her breaths came in tortured gasps as she pleaded with him. Please hold me so close that you absorb every cell in my body. Please fill me so the emotions won\u2019t hurt so much. Please let me touch you. Cassie didn\u2019t think she meant his body with that last \u201cplease.\u201d But then she wasn\u2019t doing much thinking at all right now.</p><p>Raw emotions and sensations that threatened to wash her away shook her until she gripped the bottom sheet as an anchor. She whimpered as he slipped his tongue in and out, in and out.</p><p>Cassie clenched her muscles around the indescribable pleasure\u2014trying to slow it down, hang on to it. Finally her emotions overflowed the dam she hadn\u2019t done much to shore up.</p><p>Need, want so intense that it hurt, and an unnamed emotion that tugged and tugged at her heart until she expected it to explode from her chest battered her. With a growl she didn\u2019t even recognize as coming from her, she raised herself enough to tangle her fingers in his hair and yank.</p><p>He didn\u2019t fight her. She sensed that his eyes would be black behind his glasses, and she would\u2019ve sworn his hands shook as he grasped her arms and flopped onto his back, dragging her on top of him.</p><p>Cassie wasn\u2019t sure who the vampire was here, because she wanted to eat him alive, drain him of every drop of whatever magic he was feeding her. She whimpered as she rose to straddle him the same way he had her. Strands of thoughts mixed with the sensations and emotions, driving her into a feverish frenzy to . . .</p><p>She knew if she didn\u2019t put her mouth, her hands, on his body, there\u2019d be nothing but an empty husk of a woman left when this was over. The heat of her hunger would burn her to gray ash and then the ash would blow away on the wind of her frustrated need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie memorized every line, every curve of him as she slid her fingers over his smooth sleek body. Her fingers trembled as she spent quality time running one fingernail lightly over the hard length of his erection. Before she knew it, her mouth had replaced her hands.</p><p>She\u2019d never get enough of him. She glided her tongue over his cock\u2014all velvety soft skin and hard male need\u2014and slipped her lips over the head. As she mimicked the rhythm of love, she soaked up his deep groans.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough, it would never be enough. Her feelings fought the tangle of physical sensations, trying to tell her something, something important.</p> <p>But all coherent thought fled on the surge of what had to be her own Second One, and it was shouting, \u201cNow, now, now.\u201d</p><p>It must\u2019ve been loud enough for Ethan to hear because he put his hands on her hips and effortlessly lifted her onto his erection.</p><p>Slow. She wanted to make it last. Forever. But her body didn\u2019t agree. Cassie felt the head of his cock pressing, pressing and . . . She. Couldn\u2019t. Stand. It.</p><p>She lowered herself slowly, with exquisite care, with deep breaths each time she felt him spread her apart and push in a little farther. Slowly, focusing on the moment, the sensation, the feeling.</p><p>Then he moved. With a hard thrust, he drove into her and she lost it.</p> <p>She met his thrust with her own, joining them completely, and nothing she\u2019d ever experienced felt like the sensation of him completely filling her\u2014pressing, pressing.</p><p>She cried out as the deep dark emotional place she\u2019d found before swallowed her. Want so powerful, so primal that she felt tears streaming down her face. She wanted, no needed his body, his soul, his everything. This couldn\u2019t be love, because love wasn\u2019t this savage. And right now she could\u2019ve stepped right out of the primordial ooze.</p><p>Then she stopped thinking.</p><p>The friction. The rise and then the plunge to meet his thrusts. The hammering of her heart. The harsh rasps of her breath. The sensation of his body hard between her thighs. The friction, friction, and oh my God!</p><p>Her orgasm caught her and shook her with so much power that she couldn\u2019t even scream. She hung there while spasm after spasm shattered her past and rebuilt her future expectations. Never would she feel this way again.</p><p>And as the spasms slowly grew weaker, she mourned their loss. She was thinking again. Had he gotten his release? He hadn\u2019t . . . \u201cYou didn\u2019t bite me.\u201d She weakly climbed off him and lay on her back beside him.</p> <p>He picked up her hand and placed it over his heart.</p><p>Surprised, she could feel his heartbeat. \u201cIt isn\u2019t racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, for a vampire, that\u2019s a racing heart. Any more excitement and I would\u2019ve been the first vampire to die of a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but then grew silent. Something was wrong. Cassie didn\u2019t know how she knew, but she felt the tension in him. Was it her? \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Did she sound pitiful or what? Tell me I didn\u2019t take the most incredible trip of my life alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat we just had . . .\u201d He didn\u2019t turn his head to look at her.</p><p>Lost for words? Not something she expected from Ethan.</p><p>\u201cIt changed everything, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>What the hell did he mean by that?</p> <p>\u201cBut something\u2019s wrong. I feel it.\u201d Strange how she was so sure she could sense the feelings of a man she\u2019d known for such a short time. It was what it was, though.</p><p>Ethan finally looked at her, but his glasses hid his emotions.</p><p>\u201cYou felt what happened between us.\u201d He held up his hand to stop her response. \u201cJust know that I will keep you safe.\u201d His lips softened into a smile. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t imagine ever finding someone like you again in a thousand lifetimes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Cassie\u2019s surge of joy came first. It was all emotion. No thoughts involved. She would have been happy to stay in that state forever.</p><p>But her mind couldn\u2019t keep from messing with her happiness. The doubts began. He hadn\u2019t mentioned love. Vampire or not, he was male. Was this only about mind-blowing sex? And he\u2019d mentioned a thousand lifetimes. She\u2019d be able to share only one with him. He\u2019d have to trudge through the other nine hundred ninety-nine alone.</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t particularly want to start a dialogue on any of those topics, she chose to discuss something impersonal, nonthreatening. \u201cIs there a reason you think you might not be able to keep me safe?\u201d</p><p>Only when she saw the flash of disappointment in his expression did she realize her mistake. He\u2019d opened to her, told her his feelings, and she\u2019d ignored him. Regret weighed her down, but it was too late to go back. She\u2019d chosen to retreat from emotions that were too scary, that opened her up to hurt, and that had happened way too fast.</p><p>His expression smoothed out and he turned his head away. \u201cWe lost Darren tonight.\u201d</p><p>Shock punched her hard enough to drag a gasp from her. \u201cHow?\u201d She hadn\u2019t really known Darren, and he\u2019d been a jerk the one time they\u2019d met, but she hadn\u2019t wanted him dead.</p><p>Ethan laid his arm across his eyes as though the dim glow from the nightlight was still too much. \u201cWe\u2019ve been splitting into small groups searching for Garrity and his men. Tonight it was just Darren, Zareb, and me. We found a gang of Garrity\u2019s enhanced humans\u2014or whatever they are\u2014and their beasts. Lots of them. They were trying to capture a lone vampire.\u201d</p><p>Cassie realized how totally selfish she was. All she felt was terror at knowing the danger he\u2019d faced, was facing every night. She didn\u2019t have any fear left over for Zareb or the others.</p><p>\u201cThere were too many of them. We knew if we tried to fight them, there was a good chance they\u2019d get one of us. Vampire numbers are down in the city, so we couldn\u2019t afford to lose anyone. We decided to follow them instead and see if they led us to Garrity.\u201d</p><p>He paused and she sensed he was back in the darkness watching the enemy, wanting to destroy them, but knowing he couldn\u2019t do a damn thing.</p><p>\u201cBut Darren had always been a killing machine. He was too close to the edge. His Second One took control. It didn\u2019t have a lot of survival instincts, just a lust for slaughter. He attacked Garrity\u2019s men before we could stop him.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say something comforting, but her mind was blank to everything except the horror.</p><p>\u201cHe caught a lot of them by surprise, and they looked at him. The ones that did died. The rest were smarter and didn\u2019t stare directly at his face. Once Darren betrayed our presence, we had to fight too.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head enough for her to see the bitter twist of his lips.</p><p>\u201cZareb went into kickass sorcerer mode, I was picking the humans off without getting my hands dirty, and Darren was berserk. We made a great team.\u201d He paused and allowed the silence to gather. \u201cWe\u2019d killed most of the humans and a lot of the beasts, but we were tiring. We decided to leave.\u201d</p><p>He took his arm from his eyes. \u201cWe turned to run but Darren stayed. I saw one of the beasts rip his head from his body.\u201d Rage filled his voice. \u201cI stayed long enough to destroy the beast, and then I followed Zareb.\u201d</p><p>Ohmigod, Ethan had almost died tonight. The realization froze her.</p><p>Ethan snorted. \u201cThe vampire we saved escaped while we fought Garrity\u2019s men. Gratitude isn\u2019t a vampire characteristic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Darren.\u201d She had no other words.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I worry. Garrity could take Zareb or me some night and then he\u2019d come for you. I have to find a way to keep you safe.\u201d He was silent for a moment. \u201cYour family doesn\u2019t live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She knew what he was about to suggest. \u201cForget it. My family might live in a different state, but I still wouldn\u2019t take the chance of leading those monsters to their doorstep.\u201d</p><p>He simply nodded before climbing from the bed. She couldn\u2019t help appreciating the play of muscles across his back and the motion of his tight butt cheeks as he walked across the room and reached into the closet. He came back to bed with his sleep mask and hoodie.</p><p>He took off his glasses, and she quickly looked away.</p><p>\u201cI like to see the woman I\u2019m making love with.\u201d</p><p>She smiled absently while he slipped on the sleep mask and pulled the hoodie over his head.</p><p>\u201cWould someone who was with you a lot ever become immune to the Second One?\u201d Dumb question. She would only be with him until Garrity was dead. That should make her happy, right? It didn\u2019t.</p><p>He remained silent so long that she thought he wouldn\u2019t answer. \u201cEventually you\u2019d be able to look at my face without being affected as long as my eyes were covered. There\u2019s no immunity to the face and eyes together.\u201d</p><p>She felt his stare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wake before I do. Dress and get out of the bedroom before me.\u201d</p><p>She could only nod. There was nothing left that either of them was willing to talk about. Cassie glanced at him. He\u2019d tugged the sheet completely over his head. Evidently breathing wasn\u2019t an issue.</p><p>They both lay still until the clock told her that dawn had arrived. She didn\u2019t need to see Ethan to know that the day sleep had taken him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Closing her eyes, she forced everything from her mind. Allowing her thoughts to run in circles would drive her crazy. She could only help Ethan if she stayed sane. And somewhere during her attempt to think of nothing, she slept.</p><p>Cassie sat on Zareb\u2019s couch with the cat curled up beside her and watched them leave. After finding out what had happened last night, she was terrified to see them go.</p><p>Ethan paused to look back at her right before he walked out. He had his glasses on and was holding his hoodie closed over the lower half of his face.</p> <p>For a moment hope flared that he\u2019d come back to kiss her good-bye.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t. Not when I\u2019m like this.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother yelling at him for being in her mind. \u201cYou did the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d He didn\u2019t explain how it was different. \u201cStay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight back at you. . . . What the heck is your last name?\u201d She was doing her best to sound perky, but Cassie had the feeling that even though her \u201cper\u201d might be fine, her \u201cky\u201d was drooping badly.</p> <p>\u201cRusso. For now.\u201d</p><p>His voice had that deeper, more dangerous tone she associated with the Second One.</p><p>\u201cWell, right back at you, Russo.\u201d</p><p>She kept her smile pasted on her face until they\u2019d left. Then she sighed and looked down at the cat. \u201cAnything you want to see on TV?\u201d</p><p>The cat yawned to express her complete disinterest.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d Cassie glanced over at the two men who stood by the door looking bored.</p> <p>Colin and Dylan. They were almost carbon copies of their brothers, Ben and Todd\u2014big, muscular, with shaggy orangey hair and amber eyes. They were her bodyguards for the night.</p><p>\u201cThe TV is all yours, guys.\u201d She\u2019d go into her room and read a book.</p><p>She wandered into the bedroom, grabbed her book from the nightstand, and flopped onto the bed.</p><p>A half hour later she was still on the same page. She put the book down. Cassie hated waiting here for Ethan to come home. She felt useless. But she\u2019d learned a lot during the last week. Not the least of which was that she had no place in the middle of a battle involving vampires. She\u2019d been lucky to survive that first day. Even loaded down with weapons, she was a liability. Ethan might try to protect her instead of watching his own back.</p><p>Just when she was about to give up on the book and try the TV again, someone tapped on the bedroom door. She climbed off the bed to answer it. Colin, or maybe it was Dylan, stood waiting.</p><p>\u201cZareb just sent us a text message. They\u2019re in a battle and pretty much outnumbered. They need us now.\u201d He looked torn. \u201cI sent for someone to take over for us. He\u2019ll be here in about twenty minutes. We don\u2019t like leaving you alone, but Zareb wouldn\u2019t ask for us if he wasn\u2019t in a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Colin nodded and ran back down the hall. A few minutes later, she heard the front door close. She was alone with her panic.</p> <p>What had happened? Were they all still okay? Why couldn\u2019t Zareb call in some of his other children who were scattered throughout the city? Was Ethan safe?</p><p>She was pacing the living room with her phone in her hand when the knock came. Cassie frowned. That was fast. The new guard must have been closer than Colin had thought.</p><p>Cassie hurried into the bedroom and got the gun from her purse. If she had to open the door, she\u2019d do it with a weapon in her hand. She shoved her phone into her pocket.</p><p>Before opening the door, she tried looking through the peephole. Damn it, the outside light had burned out. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew guard.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was gruff but sounded normal.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she opened the door.</p><p>Cassie glanced past him to make sure no one was lurking in the shadows. \u201cDid you see anyone\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get any farther because someone grabbed her arm and yanked her outside. Before she could raise her gun to shoot, something massive hit her with enough force to flatten her. The gun fell from her hand. Dazed, she stared up into gleaming feral eyes.</p><p>The animal, because it was an animal, curled its lips back to reveal fangs at least six inches long. Terror froze her in place.</p><p>A man leaned over her. \u201cDon\u2019t move, lady. Oh, and I wouldn\u2019t scream. Loud noises make Henry here excited. I\u2019d hate to deliver you with puncture wounds.\u201d</p><p>It only took seconds for Cassie to put together the steps of her stupidity. She hadn\u2019t asked Colin for the name of the new guard, and she hadn\u2019t asked this man for any proof of identity. He worked for Garrity. And she was having an up-close-and-personal introduction to one of his beasts because she\u2019d been na\u00efve enough to think she could shoot faster than the animal could move. She wasn\u2019t suicidal, so she remained motionless.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d The man sounded almost fatherly. \u201cCooperation makes things a lot less messy. Now I\u2019m going to call off Henry, and you\u2019re going to get up and walk quietly to that big van. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, never taking her attention from the beast\u2019s lethal fangs.</p><p>Her heart pounded, pounded, pounded as she took short gasping breaths in an attempt to control her fear. Think. Panic wouldn\u2019t save her ass.</p><p>As she climbed to her feet, she noted that her captor had picked up her gun and shoved it into a jacket pocket. He held the end of a long leash that was attached to the beast\u2019s collar. The leash looked way too flimsy to contain all that animal power, so she assumed there was more involved in controlling it.</p><p>Cassie didn\u2019t move as the man took her phone from her pocket.</p><p>\u201cLove cell phones.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThey store so much great info on them. For example, that bloodsucker we offed last night had the phone numbers of the guards that I just sent on a trip to an empty lot on the other side of Philly. Guess they\u2019ll be pissed.\u201d He handcuffed her hands behind her and nudged her toward the van. \u201cWe need to move fast. Bet they called in a new guard to watch you. I don\u2019t want to be around when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>Cassie bit her lip to keep from screaming. She wanted to fight. But her common sense kicked in. The beast hadn\u2019t killed her, so they must want her alive for some reason. Fighting wouldn\u2019t free her, and there was no one around to hear her scream. Besides, alive was a lot better than dead.</p><p>She stared at the van\u2019s open doors. To hell with common sense. She fought. Cassie kicked the man in the leg at the same time she screamed. When he tried to grab her arm, she bit him. She had to keep him from putting her in that van until the new guard arrived.</p><p>But as she stumbled away, he moved with a speed no human should have. She had no way to defend herself as he reached her. He punched her in the stomach. At the same time, she felt a searing pain in her arm. Cassie fell.</p><p>With a curse, the man dragged her to her feet and toward the van. \u201cSee, that was just dumb. You upset Henry, and he got your arm with a claw. The boss\u2019ll be mad because you have a mark on you. That doesn\u2019t make me happy, and you want to keep me happy, lady.\u201d</p><p>He shoved her into the van and pushed her down onto the bench. Then he locked her cuffs to a short chain attached to the side of the van. The beast crammed its massive body into the back with her. It crouched a few feet away, its unblinking stare fixed on her. Cassie swallowed hard. She would not throw up.</p><p>The man closed and locked the back of the van before climbing into the driver\u2019s seat. He started the van and pulled away from the warehouse.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was alone?\u201d Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic.</p><p>\u201cI watched. Two guards went in. The same two came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you taking me?\u201d Her stomach ached and she could feel blood trickling down her arm.</p><p>\u201cTo hell, lady. And if you try any more tricks, you\u2019ll get there sooner than you expected.\u201d</p><p>Asshole. Cassie didn\u2019t ask anything else.</p><p>Instead, she tried to get her terror under control by staring at the beast. Face your fears. The man had called him Henry. Who would give an animal this frightening such an ordinary human name? Someone sick, that\u2019s who.</p><p>He\u2019s only an animal. Calm down. Right. That was like calling a tornado only a breeze. She took a close look at him. Huge furred body. A grizzly came to mind. Three clawed toes on each foot. The talons were at least five or six inches long. And the middle talon on each foot was longer and more curved than the others, good for ripping out stomachs and throats. Breathe, just breathe. They looked like the talons she\u2019d seen in pictures of the Velociraptors from Jurassic Park. And those fangs. Definitely saber-toothed tiger\u2013sized.</p><p>Finally, she lifted her gaze to the beast\u2019s eyes. She caught her breath. The beast stared back at her. Those eyes. Cassie recognized them\u2014haunting, compelling, savage.</p><p>They were the yellow eyes of the Second One.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Cassie quickly shifted her gaze while she tried to control her shaking. \u201cHis eyes . . .\u201d She bit her lip to keep from screaming when the animal edged a little closer, as though he knew she was talking about him.</p><p>The man sneered as he glanced at her in the rearview mirror. \u201cRecognize them, do you? Go ahead, stare at him. You won\u2019t die. He has the Second One\u2019s eyes, so he can draw you in, but he doesn\u2019t have the pretty face to go with them. That means he can\u2019t kill you that way. Doesn\u2019t matter, though, because he has lots of other ways to end your life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Questions whirled in her mind until she felt dizzy. What were the beasts? Where was this guy taking her? What would happen when they got there?</p><p>Then she thought of Ethan. Would he search for her? She had to believe he would. Cassie prayed that Garrity wasn\u2019t going to use her as bait. Not that she\u2019d have to live with any guilt if she was the instrument of Ethan\u2019s death, because she had no doubt Garrity intended to kill her once her usefulness ended.</p><p>And just when she didn\u2019t think she could stand one more minute of feeling Henry\u2019s stare on her, his hunger, the van pulled up behind what looked like a large abandoned building. She didn\u2019t see any lights inside.</p> <p>The man got out and came around to open the van\u2019s back doors. Henry jumped out and waited as his handler snapped his leash onto his collar. Then the man climbed in to release Cassie from the van. He didn\u2019t take off the cuffs.</p><p>He gave her a little shove toward a door hidden in the shadows. \u201cWe\u2019ve kept Mr. Garrity waiting long enough.\u201d</p><p>Inside, the darkness was complete. Henry\u2019s hungry whining urged her to go faster. Panic made her clumsy, and she tripped on what felt like a raised board. Unable to break her fall, Cassie fell to her knees hard and for a moment the pain took the place of terror. Something sharp had torn her pants and cut into her knee. But then the man was there yanking her to her feet and pushing her forward.</p><p>While she stumbled along, Cassie sensed others in the darkness. They didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t move. Guards?</p><p>Finally, she reached another door. He pulled it open and light flooded out. Cassie saw a stairway leading down. Anxious to stay a few steps ahead of Henry, she didn\u2019t hesitate.</p> <p>Once the man joined her at the bottom, he led her to the end of a hallway and then knocked on the door there. With an electronic hum, the door slid open.</p><p>He pushed her inside. \u201cThis is as far as I go.\u201d The door slid closed, leaving her alone with . . .</p><p>The smell of disinfectant made her wrinkle her nose. She glanced around the large room. It looked terrifyingly familiar. Lab equipment, sinks, and containers with God knew what in them. Gurneys, some of which had empty glass coffins on them. A man and woman stood by one of the gurneys watching her with unblinking intensity. Human? She thought so. At least the woman was. The man had that complete stillness she associated with vampires.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s gaze finally settled on the far corner of the room. A desk with a man sitting behind it.</p><p>\u201cGarrity, I presume.\u201d Cassie hoped she sounded at least semi in control. She clenched her cuffed hands into fists so they wouldn\u2019t shake.</p><p>\u201cCassie, I\u2019ve looked forward to this moment.\u201d He smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cCome. Sit.\u201d He pointed to one of the two chairs facing his desk.</p> <p>Just to make sure, she reached back awkwardly with her cuffed hands to try the door handle. Locked. Taking a deep calming breath, she walked to the chair he\u2019d indicated and sat. Then she took stock of Roland Garrity.</p><p>Cassie had pictured someone who would look the part of a human monster. He disappointed her. Standing, he\u2019d be of average height and build. Thinning, light brown hair. Faded blue eyes. A weak chin. She would pass him on the street and never notice him.</p><p>Right now, she didn\u2019t have control of her physical situation, but her mouth was still her own. \u201cWhy did you bring me here? If you try to use me as bait, Ethan won\u2019t be stupid enough to walk into a trap.\u201d</p><p>Garrity raised one brow. \u201cBait? I\u2019m afraid you overestimate your importance to the vampires. They won\u2019t bother searching for you.\u201d He leaned forward to rest his elbows on his desk. He steepled his hands and studied her. \u201cNo, I only went to the trouble of sending Caleb to take you for two reasons\u2014vengeance and to make sure Felicity\u2019s family doesn\u2019t discover that I was involved in her disappearance. Families can be tenacious and meddlesome.\u201d</p><p>Vengeance. Cassie repressed a shudder. She didn\u2019t trust herself to speak, so she simply stared at him.</p><p>He went on as though he hadn\u2019t expected her to comment. \u201cYou are directly responsible for the loss of Eternal Rest. Now I\u2019ll have to deal with insurance and a police investigation besides having to find a new place of business. I believe you owe me for all the trouble you\u2019ve caused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you going to do?\u201d No matter how horrible, she wanted to know his plans.</p><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019ll explain all this\u201d\u2014he swept his hands wide to encompass the room\u2014\u201cbecause no one should have their human life terminated without knowing why it happened. And then I\u2019ll change you from a pain in the ass into a useful commodity.\u201d</p> <p>Human life terminated. There it was. She was going to die. There was a kind of sick relief in knowing the worst. Cassie didn\u2019t say anything, because if she tried to speak she knew her voice would shake. She wouldn\u2019t give him the opportunity to gloat over her terror.</p><p>\u201cI and all my employees are part of a larger organization run by a brilliant man. He\u2019s never shared his name with us, but I understand his desire for anonymity. We simply call him the Collector.\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cAnd he collects what?\u201d She was proud that her voice sounded clear and steady. He would never know how much effort she\u2019d put into those four words.</p><p>\u201cNonhumans with extraordinary powers and humans with potential.\u201d He leaned back in his seat again, his expression filled with admiration for the Collector. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing scientist, and he\u2019s found a way to transfer power from nonhumans to very rich humans willing to pay for it. The nonhumans are kept alive while their power is slowly leached from them. Our clients have a lifetime supply as long as they don\u2019t get greedy.\u201d</p><p>Cassie knew her horror was written all over her face. She couldn\u2019t put together words to describe her disgust. So it was lucky that Garrity wasn\u2019t expecting a comment.</p><p>\u201cThose we choose to sell must be physically beautiful as well as powerful. We package our products in attractive clear glass coffins so that our clients can not only enjoy their new power but also have something aesthetically pleasing to admire.\u201d He raised one brow. \u201cAny questions so far?\u201d</p><p>Can I throw up on your desk? She forced words past the boulder lodged in her throat. \u201cFine, so I understand why you collect beautiful vampires. But why humans?\u201d Other questions pushed and shoved to be next in line.</p><p>He looked surprised that she\u2019d ask that question. \u201cEvery human has latent power. When the human becomes vampire, that power is freed. Of course, we can\u2019t charge as much for humans we\u2019ve just changed because they don\u2019t have a proven gift yet.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou can think of them as sort of grab bags. The buyer has no guarantee, but sometimes he gets a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>Cassie felt as though her eyes were glued open. She couldn\u2019t blink, couldn\u2019t breathe, and her heart was pounding so hard that she wondered if every vampire in the city could hear it. No, he couldn\u2019t be going where she thought he was going.</p><p>Garrity\u2019s smile was twisted and evil and happy.</p><p>\u201cWill your buyer get a pleasant surprise, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>Whatever had been holding her in her seat snapped. She was out of it and running for the door even though she knew it was locked. Reason didn\u2019t enter into the blind terror she felt. She kicked at the door and screamed. And when the human who wasn\u2019t a human grabbed her, she bit and kicked and cursed.</p><p>Somewhere deep inside where her reasoning self hid, she wasn\u2019t surprised when she felt the prick of a needle. Cassie fought to stay awake, because to close her eyes was to lose her humanity. The man picked her up and placed her on one of the empty gurneys. He took the cuffs off her and then immobilized her with leather restraints. As her vision began to dim, she was aware of Garrity leaning over her.</p><p>\u201cThis is your binder, Cassie.\u201d He beckoned the woman closer. \u201cShe\u2019s a member of a powerful binder family that works exclusively for the Collector. Fortunately, he\u2019s loaned her to me until I replace Tony.\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to bring a good price to make up for killing him.</p><p>\u201cOnce we\u2019ve drained you and replaced your blood with nice fresh vampire blood, we\u2019ll tuck you into your shiny new coffin, bind you there, and then bury you in one of the cemeteries I own until someone purchases you.\u201d His smile returned. \u201cDid I mention that the Collector is brilliant? We can hide our merchandise in ordinary graves where no one would think to look.\u201d He started to turn away, but then glanced back. \u201cI do hope you\u2019re not claustrophobic.\u201d</p><p>Cassie couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open any longer. Her lids drifted shut, and surprisingly, the last thing she thought about was Ethan. Now she\u2019d be able to stay with him for the rest of his nine hundred ninety-nine lifetimes. As blackness descended, she screamed and screamed and screamed inside her head.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>No one would look at his face. Ethan didn\u2019t blame them. The Second One was strong tonight.</p><p>He\u2019d hunted for Cassie alone last night. And when he\u2019d tracked down a group of six of Garrity\u2019s men, he hadn\u2019t hesitated. He\u2019d killed them all along with their two beasts, one at a time, while he hid in the shadows. The last man he\u2019d kept alive long enough to get the information he wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put on his sunglasses and pulled his hood forward to hide his face.</p><p>Zareb paced his living room restlessly. The other vampires stood motionless around the room\u2019s edges, unwilling to come closer to him or Zareb.</p><p>\u201cYou returned home almost at dawn this morning. Tell me anything you didn\u2019t have time to tell me before the day sleep took you.\u201d Zareb paused in his pacing.</p> <p>Ethan almost growled. Cassie had been gone for three days. The hell with talking, he wanted to get moving. They\u2019d finally figured out where Garrity had Cassie, and Ethan wanted to be there now. He\u2019d kill every one of the bastards. And if they\u2019d hurt her\u2014he wouldn\u2019t even consider the possibility that she was dead\u2014he\u2019d kill them slowly. No Second One for them. Too easy. The Second One rumbled its thoughts on that.</p><p>But Zareb wouldn\u2019t get his ass moving until he got an answer to his question. \u201cThe Collector is a scientist and a fucking entrepreneur according to what the guy said last night. I told you about the coffins and the binders. This Collector rewards those who work for him by feeding them small doses of energy from captive vampires. That\u2019s why his men move so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Zareb glanced at his watch.</p><p>\u201cThe Collector created the beasts. He\u2019s a stem cell research genius. The beasts really are made from a bunch of other animals.\u201d He stopped and closed his eyes. This was the hardest part to tell. \u201cHe searches particularly for vampires from our bloodline who\u2019re lost to the Second One. I don\u2019t know how the hell he does it, but he uses their brain cells to create the beasts\u2019 brains. They have our intelligence, hunting ability, and the Second One\u2019s mindless lust for killing. The one difference is that the Collector has programmed their brains so that he or his people can control them.\u201d He turned away. \u201cI\u2019m sure he was pissed off that one of his beasts killed Darren and that Garrity didn\u2019t get a chance to harvest his brain.\u201d</p><p>The gathered vampires moved restlessly. Their hate, their need to kill battered at Ethan.</p> <p>\u201cAfter we take care of Garrity, this Collector is fucking finished.\u201d Death lived in Zareb\u2019s eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Ethan was oblivious to the dark streets, to the others in the car. He reached out with his thoughts, searching, searching. Damn it, why couldn\u2019t he sense her? He finally grew aware that the car had stopped. He climbed out and waited while other cars parked nearby.</p><p>Zareb had pulled out all the stops. Twenty of his children surrounded him. The four brothers who guarded his home stood a little apart from them.</p><p>One of the brothers spoke. \u201cWe left her alone, so we\u2019re here to help get her back.\u201d</p><p>Zareb nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re a mile from the building where we think Garrity is headquartered. He\u2019s grown careless and arrogant. He doesn\u2019t know how many children I have or how powerful we are when united.\u201d He stared into the darkness. \u201cRun, my children. And then kill.\u201d</p><p>And so they ran, shadows gliding silently around buildings and through streets. Ethan was the first to reach the abandoned building. The rest spread out around it, looking for other ways in. He wanted to tear the door off with his bare hands, but Zareb moved in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too lost to your anger. We don\u2019t need any noise to announce our visit. Let me.\u201d Zareb touched the door and it simply dissolved.</p><p>Ethan stepped inside and then froze. He knelt and touched his finger to the floor. Her blood, her scent. He looked back. \u201cShe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>They flowed silently into the building.</p><p>Cassie lay in her glass coffin. She could see everything as long as she didn\u2019t have to turn her head. Her mind was alive, a maelstrom of panicked thoughts and emotions. Where was Ethan? Had Garrity caught him? And how could she exist like this\u2014her eyes the only thing she could move\u2014for a lifetime?</p><p>No, no, no! Horror broke over her in waves of terror and despair. She was a vampire. She could live for many lifetimes. Like this.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even twitch, but her senses were so sharp they almost hurt. Cassie could hear sounds from outside the coffin\u2014whispers, laughter, and a discussion about when the best time to bury her would be. Her heartbeat raced, and she would\u2019ve screamed if she could make a sound. Her mind spun images of looking up from the bottom of her grave as clods of earth landed on top of her coffin over and over until she was imprisoned in darkness. Since she couldn\u2019t pray for death, she\u2019d pray for insanity.</p><p>Objects within her range of vision looked vibrant, almost unreal. Every detail, no matter how tiny, was distinct. Right now she could see her binder working on another victim\u2019s headstone. His name was Jon. Cassie never knew that hate could devour. She didn\u2019t need a Second One urging her to kill the binder bitch. She\u2019d put her shiny new fangs to good use if she ever got free.</p><p>No smells seeped into the sealed coffin, but if fear had an odor, she was suffocating in it.</p> <p>At least they weren\u2019t starving her. Out of the corner of her eye she could see a stand with a bag of blood hanging from it. The blood was draining down a narrow tube that had been inserted through a small opening in the coffin. Since her arms were at her sides, she couldn\u2019t see it flowing into her body.</p><p>Cassie closed her eyes, the only physical power she still controlled. She would survive on blood until . . . Would some merciful person eventually remove the tube? Did she want to die from starvation? Would she die? A question she hadn\u2019t asked. Maybe even starvation wouldn\u2019t kill her, just torture her forever.</p><p>What about her family? She\u2019d never see them again. They\u2019d grow old wondering what had happened to her, imagining her lying dead somewhere, never knowing that her fate was much worse than that.</p><p>And when she thought she couldn\u2019t bear the parade of horrendous possibilities one more second, she thought of Ethan.</p><p>Ethan who had dragged her from that nightmare basement in Eternal Rest. Ethan who loved his brother, cared about the death of his neighbors, and who rescued a bad-tempered cat that no one else would have wanted.</p><p>Ethan. The man she wanted to sleep beside for the rest of her lifetimes and now never would. The realization that she loved him came too late, much too late. A tear slipped down her face and she couldn\u2019t even freaking wipe it away. How pathetic was that?</p><p>The sounds of raised voices yanked her from her pity party. Damn, she wished she could turn her head. Everyone was yelling at once. She could just see Garrity.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean they killed all the guards? There were two dozen of you up there. How did they get past the fucking beasts?\u201d Garrity was shouting into his cell phone.</p><p>The binder crouched, whimpering beside Jon\u2019s headstone.</p><p>Cassie pictured herself bringing the stone down on top of her murderous head. And then she forgot about the woman. Was the place under attack? Finally, she dared to think the impossible.</p><p>Had Ethan found her?</p><p>Garrity cursed as he shoved the phone into his pocket. He ran toward the other side of the room, but Cassie couldn\u2019t see what he was doing. Then she heard the sound of a door opening.</p><p>\u201cCut the crying crap and get over here. I always have an escape route. This tunnel will bring us out one street over. Once I close this door behind me it\u2019ll lock. I won\u2019t wait for you even for the Collector.\u201d Fear lived in Garrity\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you\u2019ll wait for us.\u201d</p><p>Cassie would\u2019ve laughed if she could. She recognized the voice of Ethan\u2019s friend. Stark.</p><p>\u201cWe figured you\u2019d have a secret hole to crawl into, so we looked for it.\u201d</p><p>Garrity came back into view as he scuttled away from the door. He grabbed the screaming binder and yanked her in front of him. Then he dragged her back toward his desk. Cassie could hear him pulling a drawer open.</p><p>Frustrated, Cassie lost sight of him again.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t need a sword. This gun will splatter your skulls all over the room. No regenerating a new head.\u201d Garrity\u2019s voice shook. \u201cAnd I have her in front of me. I\u2019m walking out of here and you\u2019re not going to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Stark\u2019s laughter rang with wicked anticipation. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to kill you. Someone else wants that pleasure. But forget about walking out of here because . . .\u201d</p><p>Cassie rolled her eyes to the left in time to see the hall door implode.</p><p>\u201cMy buddy\u2019s here to send you to hell.\u201d Stark\u2019s voice ended in a snarl.</p><p>Whatever Garrity saw in the hallway, it sent him stumbling over to put her coffin between himself and the door.</p><p>Cassie was still thinking about that snarl. That sound couldn\u2019t have come from Stark\u2019s throat. Cassie mentally cursed as she made a desperate attempt to see. She needn\u2019t have bothered. Suddenly, a tiger leaped into view. It faced Garrity across the width of her coffin. It rose onto its hind legs and put its freaking front paws on the coffin and growled at him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>The new voice came from the doorway. Cassie knew that voice. Ethan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d Garrity sounded as though he were in full panic mode as he warned the binder.</p><p>Too late. The binder had looked. Cassie watched her die. And as much as Cassie wanted to feel sorrow at another death, she could only remember what they\u2019d planned for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The binder\u2019s death freed her. Cassie pounded on the coffin and shouted for someone to let her out. She watched in horror, unable to help, as Garrity\u2019s finger tightened on the gun\u2019s trigger.</p><p>Then he was yanked from her view. She twisted her head in an attempt to see what was happening at the same time she heard one blood-chilling scream. Then silence.</p><p>Zareb loomed over the coffin and lifted the lid. \u201cEthan really should have made it last a little longer. But the Second One was impatient. It doesn\u2019t understand the beauty and satisfaction that come from a lengthy vengeance.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan shoved Zareb aside and lifted her from the coffin. He\u2019d remembered to put his glasses back on and he\u2019d pulled his hood as far forward as he could.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Did they hurt you?\u201d He grabbed a sheet from the nearest gurney and wrapped it around her.</p><p>Then he gathered her close to his body and she could hear the rapid beat of his heart against her cheek.</p><p>How to tell him\u2014what she was, and how she felt about him. But she didn\u2019t have to bother with one of those disclosures. He lifted her chin and stared at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re vampire.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. Would that make a difference?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice was soft with his regret.</p><p>What should she say? It\u2019s no big deal? Hey, I was ready for a lifestyle change anyway? There was no good response, so she simply nodded.</p><p>Cassie felt dazed as she looked around her. A bunch of vampires and four tigers were crowded into the room. Some of the vampires were smashing coffins and equipment while others searched through file cabinets and Garrity\u2019s desk for information. The tigers just lay there looking bored.</p><p>\u201cTigers?\u201d The word came out as a squeak.</p><p>Ethan laughed. \u201cThose are our four guards. They\u2019re shifters. They wanted in on the takedown.\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed hard. Vampires and shape-shifters were real. What other myths and legends were real? \u201cCan we find somewhere to talk alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home. They don\u2019t need us here. I came in Zareb\u2019s car. I\u2019ll borrow it and he can get a ride with one of the others.\u201d</p><p>She waited while he retrieved the key and then followed him back to the car. As if by mutual agreement, neither of them spoke during the drive. Once back in Zareb\u2019s home, he heated some bagged blood for her and drank some himself. Then, still silently, he led her to their bedroom.</p><p>Cassie really wanted to just jump into bed with him and make love forever. But that would be impulsive. This was one of the most important decisions of her life, and she had to take her time. She took a shower first and then waited while he took one.</p><p>He came to the bed naked except for his dark glasses. It wasn\u2019t hard to keep her gaze from his face. She had other interesting places to look, scenic views to enjoy.</p><p>Ethan slid into bed and drew her to him. She hadn\u2019t bothered with a nightgown so it was skin against skin. She couldn\u2019t help it, she rubbed her hands over his back, his buttocks, and then she closed her eyes as she tangled her fingers in his hair and he covered her mouth with his in a long drugging kiss. The sensory overload almost blew her vampire circuits.</p><p>When she finally drew back, she knew she\u2019d stalled long enough. \u201cI had lots of time to think while I was in that coffin.\u201d She couldn\u2019t do this with her eyes closed, so she drew in a deep breath of courage, and stared at his face. And discovered something amazing. Yes, she could still feel the pull, the compulsion, but she could resist, she didn\u2019t have to look away.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p> <p>He smoothed her hair from her face and then kissed her forehead, her cheek, her throat.</p><p>Just say it. This had all seemed a lot easier in theory. She took a deep breath. \u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me?\u201d His breath was warm on her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She absorbed the wonder of him.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and she had to rethink her earlier confidence that she could resist him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe I didn\u2019t know. But I had hope. Lots of hope. Besides, I\u2019ve just spent three nights practicing how to say \u2018I love you\u2019 in a way that would convince you that I could make you happy for life.\u201d His tone suggested he hadn\u2019t quite believed he could do any convincing at all.</p><p>Fine, so she was crying. She swiped at her tears with her fingers. She glanced at them. \u201cOh, yuck. I\u2019m really crying bloody tears. Gross.\u201d</p><p>His soft laughter sent chills wherever chills could go.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to make sure you don\u2019t cry anymore.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and squeezed. \u201cI love you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about making me happy for just one lifetime. Now we have a thousand lifetimes to work on it.\u201d</p><p>He used his thumb to dry any remaining tears. \u201cAnd once we reach a thousand lifetimes, we can start all over again.\u201d</p><p>IN STILL DARKNESS</p><p>DIANNE DUVALL</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Like the last survivor in a postapocalyptic world, Richart d\u2019Alen\u00e7on strode down the deserted North Carolinian street. Buildings long since abandoned for the night stared out at him with vacant eyes. Quiet enfolded him, both comforting and disconcerting.</p><p>A new enemy had risen among the vampire ranks. A self-proclaimed vampire king, who had ordered his followers to transform their victims instead of just feeding from them. Most nights Richart fought and defeated two or three vamps at a time. A couple of the older immortals had been encountering groups of six, seven, and eight. But tonight . . .</p><p>Richart had not encountered a single vampire, and soon dawn would break.</p><p>A woman cried out in the distance, snagging his attention.</p><p>\u201cH-how did you do that?\u201d she asked shakily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a vampire, bitch,\u201d a young man taunted.</p><p>Darting between businesses, Richart plunged into the trees beyond, traveling so swiftly most humans wouldn\u2019t see him. Those who did would see but a blur.</p><p>\u201cLook into my eyes,\u201d a second man said, artificially deepening his voice and speaking with a laughable B-movie version of a Transylvanian accent. \u201cLook into my eyes and know me for who I am.\u201d</p><p>Richart burst from the trees and raced through the oil-stained parking lot in front of a big-ass 24-hour superstore, letting the ridiculous conversation be his guide.</p><p>\u201cI am Dracula,\u201d the second vamp continued dramatically.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d the female captive countered, \u201cjust take the money. Here\u2019s my purse. Take it.\u201d</p><p>Richart almost laughed. She may not know what the hell was going on, but she wasn\u2019t buying that the kid in front of her was the legendary horror figure Dracula.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money,\u201d Dracula said petulantly, losing the accent.</p><p>\u201cDude, just bite her,\u201d a third vamp urged. \u201cI\u2019ve got shit to do.\u201d</p><p>Richart zipped past two employees taking a smoking break. Busy chatting and texting, they would assume the breeze that ruffled their hair was caused by a gust of wind, not an immortal warrior seeking prey.</p><p>Circling around to the back of the sprawling concrete structure, he found three vampires. All appeared to be in their early twenties and huddled in the shadows between two Dumpsters, out of range of the cameras mounted on the corners of the building. Between their lanky forms, Richart glimpsed a small, slender figure shoved up against the wall and held there by a fourth vamp, the one who called himself Dracula.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Dracula snarled at the others, then went B-movie Transylvanian again. \u201cI am Dracula. I am . . . vampire.\u201d He peeled his lips back and revealed gleaming fangs.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d</p><p>Richart could do nothing to free her until the vampire released her. If he struck now, the vamp could break her neck.</p><p>So he simply cleared his throat.</p><p>The vampires all looked in his direction.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did you come from?\u201d one spouted and shifted, giving Richart a clearer view of the captive.</p><p>The woman turned her head to meet Richart\u2019s gaze.</p><p>And the oddest little tingle danced through his chest.</p><p>She was pretty, with fiery red hair that fell just beneath her shoulders, pale freckled skin, and wide hazel eyes that met and held his, full of both hope and fear.</p><p>Dracula drew his lips farther back from his fangs and hissed like a cat.</p><p>Crossing his arms over his chest, Richart leaned against the building. \u201cYes\u2014yes. I have a very nice pair of those myself.\u201d He smiled, revealing the tips of his own fangs.</p><p>Hope fled her features as the woman turned back to Dracula.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s ours,\u201d Dracula said, \u201cso fuck off. You know the king doesn\u2019t want us to fight.\u201d</p><p>These guys must be new. They didn\u2019t even realize he was an immortal, not a vampire.</p><p>The woman surreptitiously stuck her hand in her purse, then yanked it out and sprayed Dracula in the eyes and mouth with pepper spray. With his heightened sense of smell and taste, it would\u2019ve felt like she had just held a blowtorch to his face.</p><p>Dracula stumbled back, howling and scrubbing at his eyes.</p><p>Richart drew two daggers and shot forward, burying one to the hilt in Dracula\u2019s chest and driving him away from the woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cImmortal Guardian!\u201d the first vampire blurted.</p><p>Quick as lightning, Richart sliced Dracula\u2019s carotid and brachial arteries, then turned to fight the remaining three.</p><p>The woman took off running. Two vamps converged on Richart with bowies as long as his forearm. Faster and stronger than the vampires, Richart fended off almost every blow and scored plenty of his own, stabbing and slicing until the vamps began to bleed out faster than the virus that infected them could repair the damage.</p> <p>As the two sank to their knees, clasping their throats, Richart approached the last vampire.</p><p>He had caught the woman a few Dumpsters down, shoved her up against the wall, and sunk his teeth into her neck.</p><p>Richart swept over to the vampire\u2019s side. The tip of his dagger pricked the skin above the vamp\u2019s carotid artery.</p><p>The vampire froze, eyes darting toward Richart.</p><p>\u201cRelease her and back away,\u201d Richart advised quietly.</p> <p>The vampire tightened his arm around her torso and slid one hand up to grasp her chin. Fangs receding, he murmured, \u201cDraw another drop of my blood and I\u2019ll break her neck.\u201d</p><p>As Richart watched, the boy backed away with the woman. One step. Two.</p><p>Richart remained still, biding his time.</p><p>Three more steps. The vampire shoved the woman at Richart with a touch of preternatural strength and took off, his form blurring as he fled into the night.</p><p>Richart stumbled backward and wrapped his arms around the woman to keep her from falling.</p><p>Clinging to the front of his shirt, she buried her face in his chest. \u201cIs he gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he responded, surprised she was so coherent. When vampires and immortals turned, glands formed above the retractable fangs they grew that released a chemical much like GHB under the pressure of a bite. So she should be slurring her words.</p><p>Hell, he was surprised she still stood.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d he assured her. Or they would be soon. A quick glance confirmed that they were shriveling up like mummies as the virus, unable to heal their wounds fast enough to keep them from dying, devoured them from the inside out in a desperate bid to live. By the time it finished, nothing would remain of them save the clothing and jewelry they wore.</p><p>Weaving on her feet, the woman straightened and looked up at him. She couldn\u2019t be much more than five feet tall and he was six foot one. \u201cY-your eyes are glowing.\u201d</p><p>Her pupils were dilated, blocking out almost all of the pale green, leaving only a few flakes of brown.</p><p>Richart retracted his fangs. \u201cYes. I know it looks bad, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI think they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Was that the drug talking? Or did she really think so?</p><p>\u201cYou saved me,\u201d she said, awe and gratitude in her melodic voice. Loosening her death grip on his shirt, she cupped his face in both hands.</p><p>His heart skipped.</p><p>When was the last time a woman had touched his face so tenderly?</p><p>When was the last time a woman had touched him at all? Other than his sister punching him in the shoulder, doing her damnedest to kick his ass when they sparred, or doling out a hug here or there, he honestly couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman whispered. Rising onto her toes, she drew his head down and brushed her lips against his.</p><p>The contact hit him like an electrical shock. His heart began to pound as she tilted her head and increased the pressure, brushing, stroking. She combed her fingers through his short, black hair, sending shivers through him.</p><p>He parted his lips, met her tongue with his when she boldly thrust hers forward.</p><p>Pure heat.</p><p>She leaned into him, clutched him tighter.</p><p>His body hardened. His breath shortened. His arms tightened around her.</p><p>Her knees went limp. Her lips tore away from his as her head fell back. Her eyes closed. Her mouth hung open, lips pink from kissing him.</p><p>Richart stared down at her as his pulse pounded in his ears.</p><p>Yeah. She was out.</p><p>Damn it. That had been the best kiss he\u2019d had in at least a century.</p><p>And damn him for enjoying it. She was drugged, out of her senses. She wouldn\u2019t even remember any of this when she woke up.</p><p>Sighing, he examined her neck to make sure she wasn\u2019t bleeding from the vampire\u2019s bite, which would soon heal and fade. He checked her pulse to ensure she hadn\u2019t lost too much blood, then gently folded her over his shoulder.</p><p>Since he was finished hunting for the night, he would see if he couldn\u2019t clean up this mess himself instead of calling in the human network that aided Immortal Guardians.</p><p>Opening the purse she had dropped, he drew out her keys and wallet. Her driver\u2019s license yielded a name and address. He smiled. Jenna McBride. With her red hair and freckles, it suited her.</p><p>Thirty-seven years old.</p><p>Really? He would\u2019ve guessed mid-to-late twenties.</p><p>Tucking the wallet away, he studied the keys. There weren\u2019t many. Just a generic car key with no alarm to guide him to the right car in the parking lot, two door keys, and a worn Shrinky Dinks keychain that looked as if it had been fashioned by a child.</p><p>Was she married?</p><p>No. There had been no ring on her finger when she had clasped his face. And the vampires hadn\u2019t stolen it. The only things they had desired were her blood and fear.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s single. She\u2019s human. You\u2019re immortal.</p><p>No shopping bags littered the ground. The two employees taking a smoking break outside the superstore had worn the same color shirt and pants the woman did, so she must work there.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you home,\u201d he murmured and raced around to the front of the building. So swift the surveillance cameras would only catch hazy movement that would likely be mistaken for a dust devil, Richart sped up and down the rows of vehicles until he came to an \u201980s economy car that bore Jenna\u2019s scent on the door handle.</p><p>Getting an unconscious woman into the passenger seat of such a small vehicle at preternatural speeds was awkward as hell, but he managed to do it. He slid behind the wheel, his knees practically impaling his chest. A quick seat adjustment and he started the car.</p><p>Minutes later, Richart pulled into the parking lot of a nearby apartment complex and brought the car to a halt beneath a second-floor door that bore the number on her license. Exiting, he readjusted the seat in hopes Jenna would think she had driven herself home and just been so tired she couldn\u2019t remember it. He experienced a moment of unease when he opened the apartment door and immediately scented a male. Pausing just inside, he listened carefully.</p><p>Down the hall, someone slept. A lover, perhaps?</p><p>Richart carried Jenna, cradled peacefully in his arms, down the hallway and paused outside the first door.</p><p>Not a lover. Most likely a son. Though the bedroom door was closed, a male\u2019s scent dominated the room. Jenna\u2019s delightful scent, on the other hand, led him past a small bathroom to a bedroom at the end of the hallway.</p><p>He placed her on the unmade bed and gently removed her shoes. Drawing the covers up to her shoulders, he stared down at her.</p><p>He had done this so many times over the years, seeing vampire victims safely to their homes. But, for once, he found himself oddly reluctant to leave.</p><p>Listening to the soothing thump of her heartbeat, he glanced around the room. A full-sized bed. A less-than-stable-looking desk supporting an outdated computer. A closet with not many clothes. And a battered dresser upon which rested a small TV and a handful of photos.</p><p>Four of the pictures depicted a boy ranging in age from infancy to high school graduation. A fifth showed a very young Jenna holding a baby while a grinning teenaged boy stood with his arms around them both.</p><p>Richart\u2019s gaze returned to Jenna.</p><p>And still his feet refused to move.</p><p>His cell phone vibrated in his pocket. Removing it, he glanced down at the text sent by Sheldon, his Second or human guard:</p><p>Sunrise in 15. Where the hell R U?</p><p>Richart tucked away the phone. Leaning down, he brushed the hair back from Jenna\u2019s face and pressed a kiss to her forehead. \u201cHave a nice life,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He straightened. The world around him went black as a familiar feeling of weightlessness claimed him. A split second later he stood in the living room of his home.</p><p>Richart let out a piercing whistle.</p><p>A thud sounded in the study. \u201cOw!\u201d a male voice complained. \u201cDamn it! Don\u2019t do that! You scared the crap out of me!\u201d</p><p>Though such usually sparked a smile, this morning Richart felt only . . .</p><p>He frowned. What was it he felt? Regret? Sadness?</p><p>Yes, as though he had just lost something.</p><p>Sheldon entered the room. \u201cYou cut it kinda close tonight. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Richart shook his head, baffled by the uncharacteristic emotions buffeting him. \u201cNothing out of the norm.\u201d Determined to shake it off, he strode toward his young Second. \u201cWhat\u2019s the news on the vampire king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should try to eat something.\u201d</p><p>Jenna\u2019s stomach turned over at just the thought of putting food in it. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You said you didn\u2019t eat before you came in tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because everything I ate this afternoon came right back up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Debbie grimaced. \u201cFood poisoning sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d Jenna smiled at a customer who walked past, then followed as Debbie wheeled her cart to the end of the aisle and continued to restock the makeup shelves.</p><p>The store was fairly quiet, though somewhere in the distance a child threw what sounded like a doozy of a temper tantrum.</p> <p>Leaning into the basket, Jenna opened a box, drew out a handful of lipsticks, and started arranging them on the display.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the manager. You don\u2019t have to do that anymore,\u201d Debbie pointed out. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it easy tonight? No one will fault you for it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI get antsy when I\u2019m idle.\u201d</p><p>Debbie\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. Her face lit up with a wide smile. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but . . . guess who just entered!\u201d</p><p>Jenna felt a sinking sensation in her stomach that had nothing to do with the chicken sandwich that had made her so sick. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrince Charming!\u201d Debbie blurted, looking over Jenna\u2019s shoulder toward the store\u2019s only entrance open at four o\u2019clock in the morning. \u201cMr. Tall, Dark, and Yyyyyyyyyyyummy!\u201d The last was said in a growl that reminded Jenna of the Cookie Monster. \u201cAnd he\u2019s headed this way!\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>The Prince Charming currently making Debbie drool was an incredibly handsome Frenchman who had been frequenting the store for the past month or so. Every time he came in, he made a point of seeking out Jenna wherever she might be and speaking to her. First it had been to ask where he might find Krazy Glue. Then it had been to ask if she knew what houseplants fared well in low light. Then it had become friendly chatting with a hint of flirtation.</p><p>And this man didn\u2019t need to flirt to get a woman\u2019s attention. He was gorgeous. At least six feet tall. Broad shouldered and leanly muscled like an NBA player with short black hair and expressive light brown eyes. Always dressed in black with a dark coat that Debbie referred to as his Blade outfit, hold the leather.</p><p>Debbie frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. He was all smiles a second ago and now he\u2019s frowning. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think he heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sixty yards away. He can\u2019t hear us. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue. So what\u2019s the deal? Why don\u2019t you want to see him? I thought you liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like him,\u201d Jenna said as she grabbed some nail polish and slipped into the next aisle, out of Richart\u2019s sight. She really did. They had had coffee together a few times on her breaks, and she couldn\u2019t remember the last time a man had captivated her so much or made her laugh so often. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . .\u201d She set the containers down in a pile on the bottom shelf and motioned to herself. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You do sorta look like death warmed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I don\u2019t want him to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>Debbie\u2019s eyes darted to Richart. \u201cHe\u2019s smiling again. Are you sure he can\u2019t hear us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebbie! Focus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014all right. Here.\u201d Leaning in, she pinched Jenna\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh quit complaining, you need a little color. And smooth your hair back. It\u2019s all straggly.\u201d</p><p>Jenna hastily smoothed back the hair that had escaped her ponytail and made sure her shirt was neatly tucked in. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout as good as you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe circles under your eyes have a lovely purplish hue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh-shh. Here he comes.\u201d Debbie leaned over the cart and pretended to search the various boxes.</p><p>Jenna grabbed the discarded nail polish and started distributing them to their proper places on the shelves.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d Debbie said. \u201cNancy may have forgotten to order it. You want me to go check?\u201d Convinced that Richart had a thing for Jenna, Debbie always found an excuse to leave the two alone.</p><p>Or as alone as they could be in a massive superstore.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, ladies,\u201d Richart greeted them, stopping beside Debbie\u2019s cart and giving them both a smile. His eyes met and held Jenna\u2019s.</p><p>Her heart, as usual, began to slam against her ribs with all of the enthusiasm of a crushing teenager\u2019s. And her stomach filled with butterflies that really didn\u2019t mingle well with the nausea plaguing her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. The moment she had first seen Richart, a sense of familiarity had overwhelmed her. But she was certain she had never met him before. She would have remembered his good looks, his warm, friendly demeanor, and that smooth French accent. It was a puzzle.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Debbie chirped. \u201cHow\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, he drew the sides of his coat back a bit and tucked his hands in his pants pockets. \u201cIt\u2019s been a quiet night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor us, too,\u201d Debbie replied, then looked at Jenna. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go see if it\u2019s in the other basket. If it isn\u2019t there, I\u2019ll check the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Debbie gave Richart a little wave.</p><p>He bowed slightly, watched her leave, then turned a discerning gaze on Jenna.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d She mentally told the butterflies to simmer the hell down so she wouldn\u2019t start dry heaving in front of the first man to interest her in years. \u201cI assume in the private security business a quiet night is a good night?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cVery much so.\u201d</p><p>Though young (a good seven or eight years younger than she was by her guess), he was a partner in what sounded like a very successful and very elite private security company.</p><p>\u201cNever a dull moment?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cRarely,\u201d he admitted. His brow furrowed. \u201cAre you feeling all right tonight?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI look that bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as beautiful as ever, just a bit peaked.\u201d</p><p>Seriously, who wouldn\u2019t like this man?</p><p>\u201cI ate some bad fast food earlier and am paying for it big-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you home in bed?\u201d</p><p>Because I have a son on his way to medical school and need every penny of every paycheck to supplement his scholarship and keep the student loan debt he racks up to a minimum.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFor food poisoning? Nah. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Richart wasn\u2019t so sure about that, but didn\u2019t press it. Her pale, freckled skin, which usually held a faint hint of pink, had acquired a yellowish cast. Her pretty eyes, more brown than green tonight, were shadowed.</p><p>If she had looked this pallid after being bitten by the vampire from whom he had rescued her, Richart would have been worried that she might be transforming, but that had taken place weeks ago. And he had kept an eye on her ever since, watching to ensure the vampire who had fled would not return to harm her.</p><p>Of course, keeping an eye on her had only enhanced his interest. He couldn\u2019t forget that kiss. Or the feel of her slender body pressed against his. He liked her smile. He liked her laugh. The camaraderie she shared with Debbie.</p><p>His Second had caught on\u2014Richart still didn\u2019t know how, because Sheldon wasn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer\u2014and had told him to stop stalking her.</p><p>Dude, just talk to her already. It\u2019s getting kinda creepy.</p><p>Richart had only been looking for an excuse, so . . . he had followed Sheldon\u2019s advice and asked her where to find the Krazy Glue. Soon they had worked up to chatting like old friends and having coffee together whenever he managed to time his visits with her breaks.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s John?\u201d he asked.</p><p>As expected, her face lit with pride at the mention of her son. \u201cHe just aced another exam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>She clearly adored John, whom she had borne when she was a mere seventeen years old.</p><p>An employee walked past and waved. \u201cI\u2019m out, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Tracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your night off tomorrow,\u201d Tracy called over her shoulder.</p><p>Richart turned back to Jenna and arched a brow. \u201cYou have tomorrow night off?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t tonight. Being sick on my night off would have really sucked.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Just tell her to have fun and get some rest. Keep it casual. \u201cWould it be too presumptuous of me to ask if I might cook dinner for you tomorrow night? Something mild that won\u2019t upset your stomach further?\u201d Imb\u00e9cile.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I could pick up the ingredients and cook them at your place so, if you still aren\u2019t feeling well, you won\u2019t have to go out or dress up and can lounge around in . . .\u201d Hell. What did women wear when they were just hanging around the house? His sister always sported combat gear and weapons.</p><p>\u201cYoga pants and a tank top?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>He had no idea what yoga pants were, but had to struggle to keep his body from responding to the mental image of Jenna in a tank top. \u201cPerfect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cNot perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one thing,\u201d she broached with reluctance. \u201cJohn works until nine tomorrow night and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s planning to meet with his study group, so he\u2019ll probably be home by ten. I\u2019m not sure what you have in mind, but I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable . . . pursuing anything\u201d\u2014her cheeks filled with a pretty pink\u2014\u201camorous with him home or expected home any minute.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cI assure you such was not my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The pink deepened. \u201cEmbarrassing. I\u2019m sorry. I was the one being presumptuous. I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He touched her shoulder. \u201cI meant such was not my intention while you feel unwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she repeated, then sent him a shy smile.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession to make, Jenna,\u201d he said, defying caution. \u201cNormally, I rarely patronize this store.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in here at least every other night for the past month.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes. Because, once I met you, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, all awkwardness falling away. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. The first night you came in, I had the strangest feeling that I knew you.\u201d</p><p>Chier. Somewhere in her subconscious she must remember the night he had rescued her. But that time should be nothing but a black void. She should have no memory of it at all, not even enough to make her think she had seen him before.</p> <p>\u201cYou did?\u201d he asked as casually as he could.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI wanted to ask you if we\u2019d met, but was afraid you might think it was a pickup line or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Smooth.</p><p>\u201cHave we met?\u201d she persisted, face curious. \u201cThe feeling was so strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I would remember if we had.\u201d Not a lie, but misleading.</p><p>She nodded, brow faintly furrowed. \u201cYeah, me too.\u201d</p><p>Richart\u2019s phone vibrated in his pocket. Drawing it out, he glanced down to note the caller: Chris Reordon, the mortal in charge of the East Coast division of the human network that aided Immortal Guardians.</p><p>Richart gave Jenna\u2019s shoulder another light touch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have to take this.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Richart answered.</p><p>\u201cI just received a call from a woman in distress,\u201d Chris said without preamble. \u201cAll she had time to do is say, \u2018Oh, crap\u2019 and drop the phone before vampires attacked and gunshots sounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you tell how many there were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But, judging by the sounds of it, a hell of a lot. \u00c9tienne is at UNC Chapel Hill near Kenan Stadium. I need you to teleport to him and be ready to go as soon as I track down where she is.\u201d</p><p>Richart walked a couple of paces away. \u201cCould it be Tracy?\u201d Tracy was his sister Lisette\u2019s Second, and 9mms were her weapons of choice.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t Tracy. I would have recognized her voice.\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re tracing the call now,\u201d Chris continued, \u201cand should have a location by the time you rendezvous with \u00c9tienne. If it\u2019s a place you know, teleport directly to the location and join the fight. If it isn\u2019t, \u00c9tienne has his car with him and will get the two of you there as fast as he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d Tucking his phone away, Richart turned back to Jenna. \u201cLooks like I spoke too soon. It won\u2019t be a quiet night after all. A problem has arisen that requires my immediate attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I have your phone number so I may call you tomorrow to obtain your address?\u201d He didn\u2019t wish to frighten her by admitting he already knew it.</p><p>She recited it quickly. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she added as he bowed and backed away.</p><p>Warmth filled him. \u201cFeel better,\u201d he replied, earning another smile.</p><p>It took Chris longer than anticipated to trace the call, which came from way out in the boonies. \u00c9tienne violated just about every traffic law to get the two of them there as quickly as possible. When the car flew over a hill and Richart spied the battlefield ahead, he teleported himself the remaining distance and drew his swords.</p><p>Gaping, he took in what must be three dozen shriveling-up vampire corpses scattered across a blood-soaked field. \u201cMerde!\u201d</p><p>The threat, it would seem, had been annihilated. All the vampires had been taken out by . . .</p><p>His gaze strayed to a battered-all-to-hell black Prius upon which sat a small female figure, nearly hidden behind the irate, eight-hundred-plus-year-old British immortal who stood protectively in front of her, eyes blazing amber fire.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Marcus bellowed. \u201cYou show up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe call didn\u2019t come from your phone,\u201d Richart explained. \u201cSo Chris didn\u2019t know you were the one who needed help or where to send us until the GPS identified your location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dialed the number,\u201d the woman murmured, voice pained, \u201cbut the vampires attacked before I could say anything.\u201d</p><p>Marcus nodded, the eyes he trained on Richart still furious. \u201cIt took this long for him to track our location? I thought that shit worked faster than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it took this long for us to get here. You are way out in the sticks, you know.\u201d Richart eyed the two of them curiously.</p><p>Marcus continued to stand protectively in front of the woman, one hand tucked behind him, resting on her legs.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Marcus\u2019s scowl deepened. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as powerful as Seth. I can only teleport to places I\u2019m familiar with, and I\u2019m new to the area.\u201d</p><p>The hem of Richart\u2019s long coat fluttered as his brother\u2019s car skidded to a halt inches away.</p><p>The driver\u2019s door flew open and \u00c9tienne leaped out, weapons at the ready. \u201cMerde! How many were there?\u201d he asked with astonishment.</p><p>Richart turned in a circle, taking in the rapidly decomposing remains of the vampires the duo had defeated. \u201cThirty-four by my count.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9tienne gaped at Marcus. \u201cAnd you took them all out by yourself?\u201d</p><p>Marcus shook his head. \u201cWe took them all out.\u201d</p><p>As one, Richart and his brother shifted so they could better see the injured woman, who seemed to want to lose herself behind Marcus.</p><p>\u201cTwo defeated thirty-four?\u201d Richart said with a shake of his head. It was an unheard of feat. Richart would have thought only Seth\u2014the eldest and most powerful immortal and leader of the Immortal Guardians\u2014would have been capable of such. \u201cIncredible.\u201d</p><p>\u00c9tienne nodded, his gaze pinned to the woman.</p><p>Small, attractive, and blood-splattered, she boasted red hair that must have been dyed. All immortals had black hair.</p><p>Well, all but a couple who had brown hair.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Seth had called in another immortal,\u201d \u00c9tienne said, drawing the same conclusion Richart had. \u201cPleasure to meet you. I am \u00c9tienne d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, and this is my brother Richart.\u201d</p><p>Was that jealousy Richart saw flare in Marcus\u2019s eyes?</p><p>\u201cAmi isn\u2019t an immortal. She\u2019s my Second.\u201d</p><p>Richart felt his jaw drop. \u201cShe\u2019s human?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>How had one immortal and one human stood against so many vampires?</p><p>Once again, he took in the multitude of corpses littering the field.</p><p>Vampires had not even attacked in these numbers when Bastien, an immortal who had thought himself a vampire for two centuries, had raised an army and waged war with the Immortal Guardians a couple of years ago.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Jenna was beset by nerves all day as she anticipated her date with Richart.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken her long to tidy the apartment. Once done, she rearranged the kitchen cabinets and drawers, placing the nicest of her mismatched dishes and glasses in the front and on top.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember a time when money hadn\u2019t been tight. Her parents had kicked her out when she had turned up pregnant at sixteen. Her boyfriend\u2019s parents had declared their child-rearing days over and done little more than give Jenna and Bobby, John\u2019s father, first and last month\u2019s rent on their first apartment. The two had married and worked their asses off, but\u2014unable to afford health insurance\u2014had accrued thousands of dollars in debt thanks to the medical bills pregnancy and giving birth had generated. Debt they had still been struggling to pay off when Bobby had been killed in a car accident three years later.</p><p>So nice dishes and pretty glasses had been beyond her budget.</p><p>Hell, the only furniture she had owned for years\u2014other than baby furniture\u2014had been throwaway pieces other tenants had left out by the Dumpster and an inflatable mattress.</p><p>But eventually, she had paid off the debt and managed to put away a little extra here and there until she had acquired enough to furnish the apartment with something that wouldn\u2019t embarrass John when he invited friends over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Or her. Richart had said he wouldn\u2019t pursue anything amorous tonight, but she was nevertheless glad she had an actual bed in case something developed between them later.</p><p>Butterflies flocked to her stomach. She hadn\u2019t had a date in . . .</p><p>Hmm. She drew a blank on that one.</p> <p>Debbie had set her up on a blind date a couple of years ago that had gone rather well, Jenna thought, until she had mentioned having a son who planned to go to medical school. Her date had apparently mentally jumped ahead to marrying her and having to shell out a couple hundred thousand dollars in educational fees for a son who wasn\u2019t his and had run, not walked, in the opposite direction.</p><p>Dating wasn\u2019t easy for single moms.</p><p>The phone rang.</p><p>Jenna jumped. Shaking her head at herself, she answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart began to pound at the sound of Richart\u2019s deep, silky voice. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better, thank you.\u201d Well . . . a little better, anyway. Though her stomach remained unsettled, she felt somewhat confident that she would be able to eat whatever meal he prepared without projectile vomiting it on him afterward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. I thought I would run some dinner ideas by you and see what you think would be the most gentle on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>So thoughtful. \u201cOkay. What did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Richart began to list entr\u00e9es he could prepare for her. Clearly the man could cook.</p> <p>Jenna didn\u2019t know how half of the dishes he mentioned were prepared or if she even had the pots and pans needed to do it, so she went with the safest option. \u201cHow about the light salad and fettuccine Alfredo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish,\u201d he responded cheerfully. \u201cI shall see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>When Jenna opened her door shortly after sunset, Richart smiled and decided that he loved yoga pants and tank tops. The soft gray pants hugged full hips and slender thighs before falling in straight lines to a pair of sneakers. A white tank top clung to a narrow ribcage, minuscule waist, and breasts he thought would fit perfectly in the palms of his hands, which tightened around the handles of the shopping bags he carried.</p><p>\u201cI took you at your word and stayed in my comfy clothes,\u201d she said with a hesitant smile, stepping back and motioning for him to enter.</p><p>\u201cI like your comfy clothes,\u201d he professed, inhaling her sweet scent as he strode past into the small living room. Jenna plus a hint of the chocolate-raspberry soap she used. A delectable combination.</p><p>She had even worn her hair down. At work she usually pulled it back with clasps or ties or put it up in a ponytail. Tonight it fell freely in shining waves as red as the sky at sunset, tumbling across her shoulders and tempting him to comb his fingers through it.</p><p>No touching, he admonished himself. At least, no touching that might lead to more touching. She\u2019s ill and you\u2019re immortal and haven\u2019t told her. Nor do you plan to tell her. So, what the hell are you actually doing here?</p><p>Giving in to weakness.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t felt this drawn to a woman since before his transformation. She made him forget the dark violence that was such a large part of his existence and made everything somehow less tedious, so he actually looked forward to rising each day, eager to see her again.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Richart asked as she closed the door.</p><p>\u201cBoth hungry and nauseated at the same time. I haven\u2019t eaten anything all day because my stomach still isn\u2019t right. But I think the Alfredo is mild enough to stay down.\u201d She grimaced.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a self-deprecating smile and led him into the kitchen. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s just . . . I\u2019ve never talked about vomiting on a first date before. Real romantic, right?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMore romantic certainly than not mentioning it was a possibility, then spewing your dinner all over your companion as he leans in for a kiss.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThank you for being such a good sport about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me cook you dinner.\u201d He set his bags down on the counter and started removing the ingredients he\u2019d purchased on the way there. \u201cI should probably warn you that I haven\u2019t been on a date in quite a while, so I\u2019m a little rusty.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows flew up as she transferred the cold foods to her refrigerator. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger than I care to admit. My job and odd hours tend to make dating difficult.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBeing a single mom and working the night shift does, too. I haven\u2019t dated in a while either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Then, if neither of us remembers the rules, we don\u2019t have to follow them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d She closed the refrigerator door and leaned her hip against it, crossing her arms just beneath her breasts. \u201cListen, I\u2019m sort of a get-the-truth-out-there-so-when-it-comes-up-later-it-won\u2019t-be-an-issue kind of gal, so there\u2019s something I wanted to mention.\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cYou know I\u2019m older than you, right?\u201d</p><p>Richart stared down at her and forced himself not to laugh at the irony. He may be over two hundred years old, but he looked as if he were in his late twenties, thirty at the most. And Jenna was worried that her being thirty-seven would be a problem?</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I could not care less how old you are, Jenna,\u201d he assured her, all the while calling himself a bastard for not taking the opening she had provided and broaching the topic of who and what he was. She valued truth. If he continued to keep it from her . . .</p><p>A hint of insecurity entered her features. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to press this, but . . . I dated a guy once\u2014very briefly\u2014who said the same thing until his friends found out and started to razz him about it. I\u2019m thirty-seven. Are you sure that isn\u2019t a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why his friends would tease him about dating you unless they were envious. You look like you\u2019re in your twenties, Jenna. Not much older than your son, in fact. And, if you looked like you were in your forties, guess what. I would be just as interested.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and closed the distance between them. \u201cAnd if I looked like I were in my fifties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to think laugh lines are hot.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGood, because I have a feeling you\u2019re going to give me a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so,\u201d he said, telling himself not to think about the fact that he would still look and feel as he did now when she was in her sixties, seventies, and eighties and all of the problems that would generate.</p><p>You\u2019re getting ahead of yourself, old man. This is your first damned date. Not your engagement party.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m older than you. You don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m a single mom, putting a son through college.\u201d She shook her head and smiled up at him, expression soft. \u201cYou\u2019re a rare breed, Richart d\u2019Alen\u00e7on.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know the half of it.</p><p>Unable to resist, he dipped his head and touched his lips to hers in a gentle caress.</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>Lightning struck.</p><p>Both their hearts began to beat faster.</p><p>Resting a hand on her waist, Richart tilted his head and explored those smooth pink lips that had drawn his gaze so often, then drew back before his emotions could take over and make his eyes begin to glow.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jenna breathed, staring up at him.</p><p>\u201cI am so smitten with you,\u201d he admitted softly.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy accent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too, but . . . I love the way you phrase things. Like the heroes from the historical romance novels I read.\u201d</p><p>He cringed. Apparently, he was showing his age.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t look like that. I meant it in a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach chose that moment to rumble and growl. Both laughed as she covered her flat belly with one hand. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s get started so we can get some food in you.\u201d</p><p>Hands down, it was the best date Jenna ever had. Richart was charming and funny and so sexy he took her breath away. Just as that kiss had. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it.</p><p>And the man was an excellent cook. She had never been a big fan of salads, had always found them pretty bland, but he concocted some kind of homemade salad dressing that was absolutely delicious.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your stomach?\u201d he asked, taking her empty salad plate and replacing it with one heaped high with fettuccine Alfredo.</p><p>\u201cDoing good,\u201d she responded with relief. The first taste of his creamy Alfredo sauce elicited a moan. \u201cThis is delicious. Where did you learn to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI taught myself.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNo reason not to really. I don\u2019t know why some men balk at it. I love food and saw no better way to ensure I would always have a tasty meal at my disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man. I like that.\u201d</p><p>He winked.</p><p>Her pulse jumped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The front doorknob rattled as a key slipped in and unlocked it.</p><p>Aaaaaaand the moment\u2019s over, she thought as her son opened the door and entered.</p><p>Jenna watched Richart with some trepidation.

Not minding her son intruding on their romantic dinner was another.</p> <p>John hesitated before removing his key from the lock and closing the door behind him.</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>Jenna smiled at him. \u201cHi, honey. How was school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old same old,\u201d he said with a shrug and a tentative smile.</p><p>Richart rose and, setting his napkin on the table, took a step forward and offered his hand. \u201cYou must be John.\u201d</p> <p>John set the tall pile of books he carried on the sofa. He often went straight from school to work. \u201cAnd you must be Richart.\u201d He shook Richart\u2019s hand. \u201cAm I pronouncing that correctly?\u201d he asked, making sure Reeshart was correct.</p><p>\u201cYes. Richart d\u2019Alen\u00e7on. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>Jenna couldn\u2019t gauge her son\u2019s thoughts and had no clue how he felt about his mom dating. Such had rarely happened.</p><p>Richart motioned to the table. \u201cWon\u2019t you join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Clearly surprised, John eyed the food with longing, glanced at Jenna, then looked at Richart. \u201cNnnno. No, thanks. I have some studying to do and wouldn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI made more than enough,\u201d Richart tempted. \u201cPlease, sit and join us.

He actually meant it.</p><p>Again, John looked to Jenna.</p><p>She nodded and smiled.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He started for the kitchen.</p><p>Richart followed. \u201cJenna tells me you attend UNC Chapel Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d John pulled down a plate and turned toward the stove, where Richart waited.</p><p>Richart motioned him closer and began filling his plate.</p> <p>John met Jenna\u2019s gaze and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>John was almost as tall as Richart and still seemed to be growing at age twenty. His shoulders weren\u2019t quite as broad and his physique was leaner, but his brown hair was cropped short like Richart\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine used to teach at UNC,\u201d Richart mentioned.</p><p>\u201cWhat department?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? A guy in my study group is minoring in music. What\u2019s his name? Maybe they took some classes with him.\u201d</p><p>Richart smiled as the two returned to the table. Richart retook his seat at Jenna\u2019s elbow while John took the chair across from him. \u201cDr. Sarah Bingham.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyebrows flew up again. \u201cYou know Dr. Bingham? Carl said she was really something.\u201d Something awesome, his tone declared.</p><p>Richart picked up his fork. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy stirred as Jenna watched Richart smile with what could only be affection.</p><p>John tucked into the food. \u201cMan, this is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever happened to Dr. Bingham? She only taught there for a year, then disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe married a friend of mine and now works in the same business I do.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDr. Bingham works in private security? Doing what? She\u2019s like five feet tall and weighs less than my mom.\u201d</p><p>Richart pointed his fork at John. \u201cBut she\u2019s a fierce fighter and could take you down in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d He darted Jenna a look. \u201cSorry, Mom. No kidding?\u201d John was usually careful not to curse in front of Jenna. He thought doing so was disrespectful, and he would probably pass out if he ever heard some of the language she used when she was stuck in traffic.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Richart insisted.</p><p>\u201cWow. You can\u2019t judge a book by its cover, can you?\u201d</p><p>Richart gave his plate a wry smile. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d John began slowly, \u201cis this weird? My being here?\u201d He glanced back and forth between them.</p><p>It seemed weird as hell to Jenna.</p><p>Richart shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be weird. I\u2019m very taken with your mother. If I haven\u2019t bungled tonight too badly\u201d\u2014he sent Jenna a flirtatious smile\u2014\u201cI hope to see her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Had she said that too quickly?</p><p>Richart reached out and took her hand, giving it a squeeze, then returned his attention to John. \u201cWhich means I\u2019ll be seeing you again, too, so I want us to be comfortable around each other.\u201d</p><p>John eyed their clasped hands. \u201cSounds good. But it still feels weird.\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed and was relieved when Richart did, too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out eventually,\u201d Richart promised. \u201cWhat courses are you taking?\u201d</p><p>While John gave Richart a quick rundown on the classes he was taking, Richart leaned back in his chair. He stroked Jenna\u2019s hand with his thumb, sending little sparks of electricity dancing through her, as he nodded and commented here and there.</p><p>John finished his meal and pushed back his chair. \u201cSpeaking of which, I need to go ahead and hit the books. Finals are coming up and I don\u2019t want to wait until the last minute to cram.\u201d He offered his hand to Richart, who stood and shook it. \u201cThanks for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for joining us. I enjoyed meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d John put his plate in the sink, then gathered his books. Offering a final wave, he went to his bedroom and closed the door.</p><p>Smiling, Richart met Jenna\u2019s gaze as he retook his seat. \u201cI like him. He\u2019s everything you said he is. And I see a lot of you in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d John looked so much like his father. It warmed her to know there was a little bit of her in there, too.</p><p>He leaned in closer. \u201cI meant what I said, you know.\u201d</p><p>How could a man who didn\u2019t wear cologne smell so good?</p><p>He caught her hand and brought it to his lips. \u201cYou have totally captivated me and I would love to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould tomorrow night be too soon?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo, but I work tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about an early dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and glanced at the clock hanging in the kitchen. \u201cI hate to leave, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and rose, collecting their dishes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about those. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and shook his head. \u201cYou still aren\u2019t feeling well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling much better.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if it was his company or the fettuccine, but she really did. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re sure . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d she insisted, took the plates, and carried them to the sink. When she turned around, she found Richart donning his long black coat in the living room.</p><p>He was so handsome.</p><p>She walked him to the door. \u201cThis was nice.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was just thinking the same thing. I haven\u2019t smiled so much since . . .\u201d He tilted his head to one side. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll endeavor to make you smile more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn easy task to accomplish. Just keep being you.\u201d Leaning one shoulder against the door, he cupped her face in one large hand and studied her, his smile softening. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, staring up at him, she could almost believe it.</p><p>Lowering his head, he captured her lips.</p><p>This kiss was nothing like the one they had shared in the kitchen. It was no first tentative exploration. This kiss was explosive and intense, his velvety warm mouth sending her up in flames.</p><p>He slipped his tongue inside to duel with hers, tempting and teasing. One strong arm locked around her waist and drew her into his tall muscled form, pressing her breasts to his hard chest and washboard abs, her hips to the arousal that sprang to life behind his zipper.</p><p>Holy crap. Her pulse turned to molten lava. Her knees weakened even as she rose onto her toes and wrapped her arms around his neck, burrowing her fingers through his short silken hair.</p><p>He ended the kiss and pressed his forehead to hers, eyes closed, his breathing as harsh as hers. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to work,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She nodded. Sliding her hands down to tangle in the soft material of his shirt, Jenna lowered her heels to the floor. \u201cAnd I wish my son weren\u2019t in the next room.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something in French. \u201cI forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>Gradually their breathing calmed.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI keep telling myself to go, but I don\u2019t seem to be moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he raised his head. \u201cAll right.\u201d He stole another quick kiss and opened the door. \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With great reluctance, Jenna stepped back. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d he said softly as he stepped out into the night. \u201cFeel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already do.\u201d</p> <p>For the next week Richart lived a dual life. He began each evening by having dinner with Jenna. Sometimes he took her out. Sometimes he cooked for her at her place. Then they parted ways. She went to work, and he left to hunt and fight bloody battles with vampires.</p><p>He thought about her all the time. Her laugh. Her smile. Her wit. Her delectable body pressed to his. He was falling in love with her and thought\u2014hoped\u2014she might be falling in love with him. Her face lit up when she saw him, as did his own, he was sure. They never ran out of things to talk about when they were together. And the passion building between them. . .</p><p>Richart was having a hard time concealing his nature from her.</p><p>Whenever immortals experienced strong emotion, their eyes glowed. That was damned difficult to hide when the slightest touch of her hand enflamed him. Hell, just looking at her made him want to rip her work clothes off and lick every inch of her body.</p><p>But he resisted the urge and, though he knew it frustrated her, was glad either work or her son frequently intruded and kept them from doing more than the most basic of passionate explorations. He just didn\u2019t feel right about making love with her without first revealing who and what he was.</p> <p>\u201cEarth to Richart.\u201d</p><p>Richart blinked and realized his Second stood in front of him, holding out two daggers. \u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon shook his head and crossed his arms over his chest as he watched Richart tuck the blades into the sheaths on his thighs. He was young for a Second, only twenty years old. Inexperienced. And not the quickest learner. But Richart liked him and appreciated the boy\u2019s humor and teasing nature.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to tell her?\u201d Sheldon asked. He alone knew Richart was seeing someone.</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t see her tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, genius. That you\u2019re two hundred years old. Don\u2019t you think she should know she\u2019s sleeping with Methuselah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, thank you for that,\u201d Richart offered dryly as he grabbed a couple more daggers. \u201cSecond, we haven\u2019t slept together yet. And third . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the easiest topic to broach. And telling her could put her in danger.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon frowned. \u201cYou mean Reordon? He wouldn\u2019t harm her, would he?\u201d</p><p>Chris Reordon took his job protecting Immortal Guardians very seriously. \u201cAt the very least, he would interrogate and threaten her to ensure her silence. And if she didn\u2019t react well and told someone else . . .\u201d</p><p>Sheldon scowled. \u201cNo wonder Roland kept Reordon away from Sarah. But Jenna wouldn\u2019t blab, right? I mean, you know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Roland knew his fianc\u00e9e several centuries ago when he told her. Did she accept him? No. She betrayed his trust, and he awoke the next morning to a mob wielding fire, wooden stakes, and pitchforks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. No wonder he\u2019s such an untrusting bastard.\u201d Sheldon glanced at the clock. \u201cAlmost time for the meeting.\u201d</p> <p>Richart took out his cell phone. \u201cI really hate to do this. It\u2019s her night off, and I didn\u2019t get to see her yesterday.\u201d But when Seth called a meeting, one didn\u2019t balk at attending.</p><p>Disappointed, Richart dialed her number.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>A biting winter wind ruffled Richart\u2019s hair. Barren limbs of deciduous trees clacked together overhead while the leaves of evergreens fluttered and swished.</p><p>What\u2019s going on with you? a female voice with an accent identical to his own asked in his head.</p><p>Richart glanced over at his sister and brother, who examined him much like they would a previously undiscovered insect.</p><p>Stay out of my head, he warned them. Both were telepathic. Richart lacked that gift and had often bemoaned the fact as a child until he had learned he could teleport and they couldn\u2019t. They could still read his thoughts or send him their own, though.</p><p>We know when you block your thoughts and have respected your desire for privacy, Lisette said and shared a look with \u00c9tienne. But we don\u2019t have to read your mind to know something is up.</p><p>Richart frowned at the dark forest that surrounded them.</p><p>A vampire, claiming he desired the Immortal Guardians\u2019 help, had arranged a rendezvous with Marcus, Ami, and Roland (the last of whom the vampires believed was Bastien) in a clearing that had once been the site of Bastien\u2019s lair. Seth had ordered Richart, his siblings, and Roland\u2019s wife, Sarah, to follow and linger downwind in case it was a trap.</p><p>Sarah likely had no notion the French immortals were communicating silently and stood off to the side, staring intently into the trees as if she could see her husband waiting on the other side.</p><p>In lieu of answering, Richart decided to change the subject. Did anyone else notice the way Marcus looks at his Second?</p><p>\u00c9tienne smirked. As if he wishes to devour her? No, I didn\u2019t notice at all.</p><p>Richart smiled.</p><p>Rustling sounds, a mile or two distant, reached their ears. The vampires\u2019 scents\u2014four instead of only the one who had arranged the meeting\u2014followed.</p><p>\u00c9tienne drew his katanas.</p><p>Richart palmed two daggers as Lisette drew a pair of shoto swords.</p><p>\u201cI thought this was supposed to be a private meeting,\u201d they heard Marcus drawl.</p><p>\u201cInsurance,\u201d a vampire responded arrogantly. \u201cCan\u2019t blame me for being careful, can you? Besides, if he\u2019s who you say he is, then maybe he can help all three of us.\u201d</p><p>Richart caught Lisette\u2019s gaze and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>It\u2019s a trap, she confirmed with a frown. Three face our brethren while a fourth lingers in the trees, but . . . She shook her head. Their thoughts are all so loud and jumbled, I can\u2019t discern what the trap entails.</p><p>Richart looked to \u00c9tienne, keeping an ear tuned to the conversation that continued in the clearing.</p><p>\u00c9tienne wagged his head back and forth. The madness has taken them. Their thoughts are impossible to separate, as if all are shouting at once. There are only four of them, but . . . So many voices. It\u2019s as though they suffer from multiple personality disorder. I can\u2019t discern their plan.</p><p>Richart nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d the vampire addressing Marcus said with satisfaction.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Pain pierced Richart\u2019s ears as an explosion shook the ground beneath his feet. The scent of multiple vampires abruptly tainted the air as gunshots sounded and the clang of metal striking metal disrupted the night.</p><p>A shrill whistle followed as Marcus signaled for them to join the fight.</p><p>Sarah darted forward so fast she seemed to vanish.</p><p>Richart teleported to the clearing. His eyes widened.</p><p>So many!</p><p>He swiftly thrust a dagger into the heart of one of the dozens of vampires surging toward Marcus, Ami, and Roland.</p><p>Those three stood back to back to back, Ami firing her Glocks, Marcus wielding his short swords, and Roland cutting through the vampires with his sais.</p><p>As the vamp Richart impaled sank to the ground, Richart teleported again, appearing several yards away, arms extended, daggers held tightly in his palms. His blades slit the throats of two vampires racing toward Marcus and severed their carotid arteries. As they dropped to the ground, Richart teleported again and again and again, taking out vampires every time, spawning utter chaos as the vampires began to divide their attention between fighting Marcus and the others and looking around wildly for him.</p><p>Richart smiled darkly. He loved his gift. Loved the fear it inspired in his opponents.</p><p>He teleported over to his brother and took out two of the many vampires clamoring to kill him.</p><p>\u00c9tienne laughed, never ceasing his swings.</p><p>Grinning, Richart teleported over to the mob that continued to assault the trio in the center of the clearing. As soon as he appeared, sinking his blade into yet another vamp, a bullet struck him in the shoulder.</p><p>Ami gasped, her guns falling silent.</p><p>Richart couldn\u2019t fault her for shooting him. He had teleported between her and her target. He waved it off and teleported again as she resumed fire.</p><p>The battle waged on.</p><p>For every vampire the immortals and Ami killed, two or three seemed to take their place. Richart couldn\u2019t believe their numbers. Even Bastien had not commanded an army this large.</p><p>And where the hell were they all coming from?</p><p>The gunshots ended as Ami ran out of ammo and exchanged her firearms for katanas.</p><p>Richart kept one eye on her as he continued to fight, knowing her strength could not match that of the insane vampires slathering around her like rabid dogs.</p><p>Sure enough, a vamp ducked one of her swings and hit Ami hard in the head.</p><p>Richart teleported behind her and caught her as she reeled dizzily. Wrapping one arm around her waist to steady her, he hurled throwing stars with the other until she regained her feet.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she rasped over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to safety,\u201d he announced, grabbing one of her katanas and fending off the onslaught.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter if she protested. She was injured and vulnerable. The vampires were targeting her as an easy kill. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d she repeated and shoved him away. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Just give me my damned sword back!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait, just yanked it out of his hand.</p><p>Richart felt something prick the skin beneath one ear.</p> <p>As he reached up to see what it was (it felt like a bee sting), Marcus whipped around and yanked what looked like a tranquilizer dart from Richart\u2019s neck.</p><p>A similar dart hit Marcus in the shoulder.</p><p>Richart frowned. Drugs didn\u2019t affect immortals. Didn\u2019t the vamps . . . know . . . that?</p><p>Weakness engulfed him. Richart stumbled and grunted as a vampire took advantage and stabbed him in the side. Lashing out, Richart searched the blood-painted mass of fighting, snarling bodies around him and saw his sister drop to her knees. \u201cLisette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart!\u201d Ami shouted.</p> <p>Vision fuzzy, he turned and found her propping up a barely conscious Marcus, who now sported several of the darts.</p><p>\u201cGet them out of here!\u201d she shouted, her pretty, crimson-splashed face panicked. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Richart teleported to his sister\u2019s side, touched her shoulder, and took her to David\u2019s home.</p><p>David was the second eldest and second most powerful immortal in existence and maintained an open door policy for all immortals, Seconds, and members of the human network. With the drug coursing through his system, slowing his movements, and clouding his thoughts, Richart could think of no safer place.</p><p>In David\u2019s spacious living room, David\u2019s Second Darnell, Lisette\u2019s Second Tracy, and Sheldon sat side by side on one of the sofas, their gazes glued to Darnell\u2019s laptop.</p><p>As soon as Richart and Lisette appeared, they leapt to their feet.</p> <p>Richart staggered.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sheldon asked, eyes wide.</p><p>Tracy and Darnell hurried over to catch Lisette as she lost consciousness.</p><p>\u201cDrugs,\u201d was all Richart could manage.</p><p>\u201cDr. Lipton!\u201d Darnell bellowed over his shoulder moments before Richart teleported away.</p><p>As soon as he appeared back at the battle, another dart struck him.</p><p>Swearing, he yanked it out, sped over to his brother\u2019s side, and touched his shoulder.</p><p>The world around them blurred as he took them to David\u2019s.</p> <p>Sheldon and Cameron, \u00c9tienne\u2019s Second, waited anxiously in the living room. Darnell, Tracy, and Lisette were gone.</p><p>Cam lunged forward and caught \u00c9tienne as he slumped toward the floor. Sheldon stepped forward and held up an M16. \u201cTake me back with you.\u201d</p><p>Richart clasped Sheldon\u2019s shoulder. The room around them dimmed, but they didn\u2019t teleport. He tried again and only managed to teleport them to the front door.</p><p>Swearing, he grabbed the M16 and shoved Sheldon away. His surroundings went black. He made it back to the clearing this time. Sarah and Ami were trying to hold off the many remaining vampires while supporting Marcus and Roland.</p><p>Everything was . . . out of focus. Confusing. Richart couldn\u2019t think straight. He needed to be able to think straight so he could teleport the others to safety.</p><p>Sarah and Ami spoke urgently beside him.</p><p>He looked around, past the glowing eyes of the vampires who circled them like jackals.</p><p>Where was Lisette? Had he teleported her already? What about. . .</p><p>Where was Sheldon? Hadn\u2019t Sheldon been with him just now?</p><p>Sarah folded her husband over one shoulder, then leaned forward so Ami could fold Marcus over the other one. If she intended to flee, the heavy men\u2019s weight would significantly slow her retreat.</p><p>Richart glanced down and discovered he held an M16. He thrust it into Ami\u2019s small hands. His own seemed uncooperative.</p><p>Another dart hit him.</p><p>Sarah would never be able to outrun the vampires if Ami slowed her down, too.</p><p>Even as the thought flitted through his mind, he heard Ami convince Sarah to leave without her.</p><p>Good. At least Sarah, Roland, and Marcus would get away.</p><p>Richart and Ami would be left to fight the two dozen or more vampires who remained. Ami was mortal and no match for their speed or strength. And he was so weak he could barely lift his arms. If he couldn\u2019t teleport the two of them out of there, their fates would be sealed. Both would die this night.</p><p>Odd that he would think of Jenna in that moment, lamenting that he would never see her again.</p><p>He needed to try to teleport Ami away.</p><p>As he reached for her shoulder, his vision dimmed and went black.</p><p>The apartment was quiet, save the faint clicking sounds the flatware made against their plates as Jenna and John ate a late dinner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Richart had to cancel tonight,\u201d John said, his gaze far too discerning.</p><p>Jenna had been disappointed as hell when Richart had called and said he couldn\u2019t make it. Apparently some problem had arisen at work that required his attention.</p><p>She sighed. Or had it?</p><p>Had it just been an excuse? Had he grown tired of either work or her son\u2019s presence constantly impeding their desire to become more intimately involved?</p><p>At a loss, she decided to seek John\u2019s advice. Her son was popular with the girls and had dated far more than she had in her lifetime, so . . . why not? \u201cShould I read anything into it that he canceled two nights in a row?\u201d</p><p>If he thought it odd that his mother wanted his opinion on her love life, John hid it well. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, considering the line of work he\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut? I hear a but in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do think it\u2019s odd that he always comes over here and hasn\u2019t taken you to his place yet. I mean, you have dinner together every night. I would think he would be getting tired of me being a third wheel on the nights he doesn\u2019t take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said his nephew lives with him. So it wouldn\u2019t be any different at his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked. \u201cI mean, maybe you should suggest it . . . just to make sure he isn\u2019t one of those guys who cheats on his wife and doesn\u2019t tell his mistress that he\u2019s married.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sank.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look like that,\u201d John said quickly. \u201cI\u2019m probably just being paranoid. You\u2019re my mom. I\u2019m suspicious of every man you date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike there have been that many,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he cajoled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably what you said. Or maybe he\u2019s a slob and doesn\u2019t want you to see.\u201d</p><p>That made her smile. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a slob.\u201d Richart was always meticulously groomed and dressed. She couldn\u2019t imagine his home being less so.</p><p>\u201cHey, you never know. A friend of mine\u2014\u201d</p><p>A large dark figure suddenly loomed in Jenna\u2019s peripheral vision.</p><p>Letting out a surprised shriek, she jumped up, bumping the table and knocking over her glass of tea.</p><p>John grabbed his steak knife and leaped up to confront . . . \u201cOh, shit!\u201d</p><p>Jenna\u2019s eyes widened. Her breath stopped. Shock immobilized her.</p><p>Richart stood in the middle of their living room, having appeared out of thin air.</p><p>She swallowed, mouth dry.</p><p>His eyes glowed a brilliant amber. They glowed. His breath was labored, soughing in and out of parted lips that exposed gleaming fangs. His hair was windblown, his face splattered with\u2014</p><p>\u201cIs that blood?\u201d John asked shakily, moving over to stand protectively close to Jenna.</p><p>She nodded. Nearly all of Richart\u2019s dark clothing glistened with the ruby liquid and sported numerous cuts and tears. There even appeared to be a bullet hole in one shoulder.</p><p>Richart said nothing, just swayed where he stood.</p><p>\u201cRichart?\u201d she asked, voice and body trembling as tea slithered over the table\u2019s edge and hit the floor with a tap tap tap.</p><p>He turned toward her, but didn\u2019t seem to see her.</p><p>\u201cRichart?\u201d she repeated and took a step toward him.</p><p>John grabbed her arm. \u201cStay back.\u201d</p><p>Jenna shook him off and slowly forced her feet to carry her forward.</p><p>Swearing, John stuck close to her side, his steak knife at the ready.</p><p>\u201cRichart,\u201d she called again when she stood only a few feet away.</p><p>The glow in his eyes began to fade, returning them to the warm brown of which she had become so fond. The fangs receded, disappearing into his gums as if they had never been.</p><p>He mumbled something in French.</p><p>Jenna consulted her son. \u201cDo you know what he said?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten most of the French I learned in high school.\u201d</p><p>Richart blinked and dipped his chin. He seemed to be having a hard time focusing. \u201cJenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Panic danced across his face as he lunged forward and grabbed her upper arms.</p><p>\u201cWhoa-whoa-whoa!\u201d John tried to intervene, or at least to break the bruising grip, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Richart demanded, his accent so thick and his words so slurred she had difficulty understanding him. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. You must go.\u201d</p><p>Jenna gently clasped his arms. \u201cRichart, we\u2019re in my apartment. Do you understand me? We\u2019re in my apartment.\u201d She spoke slowly and deliberately, heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>His brows drew down in a deep V. \u201cYour . . . ?\u201d He glanced around. Releasing one of her arms, he rubbed his eyes and looked around again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could feel him trembling. The hand that gripped her shook violently. And he began to slowly press downward as if he had to use her to prop himself up.</p><p>Jenna watched him take in the sofa, the stained coffee table, John, and their abandoned dinner.</p><p>Relief softened his features as he swayed. \u201cWe made it out? I got us out?\u201d</p> <p>Before she or John could ask out of what, Richart looked around again. \u201cWhere is Ami?\u201d</p><p>Jenna felt the sharp glance John sent her. \u201cWho is Ami?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His frown returned, as did the alarm. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who Ami is, Richart. You just . . . appeared . . . out of nowhere. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t with me? I left her there?\u201d</p> <p>John stepped forward. \u201cLeft her where? Who\u2019s Ami? What the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Richart began to mumble in French again.</p><p>Jenna gave him a little shake. \u201cRichart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go back,\u201d he said, face stricken. He released his hold on Jenna and, breaking her own, staggered away two steps.</p><p>When he listed to one side, Jenna hurried forward to steady him.</p><p>He pushed her away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he wheezed. \u201cI\u2019ll take you with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>John grabbed her by the shoulders and drew her back.</p><p>Richart reached beneath his coat and drew out two very lethal looking daggers.</p><p>John swore.</p><p>Richart squeezed his eyes closed, so wobbly on his feet the faintest breath of wind would have knocked him on his ass.</p><p>As Jenna stared at him, his form began to fade, becoming translucent. Her breath caught. She could actually see the other side of the room through him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d John whispered.</p><p>Then Richart became solid again. He opened his eyes, saw them, and growled with frustration. Stumbling a couple of steps to the left, he thrust out an arm and pressed a bloody fist against the wall until he could regain his balance, then straightened. He squeezed his eyes shut, brow crinkling with concentration. Again his form began to fade, becoming phantomlike.</p> <p>\u201cMom . . .\u201d John said. \u201cAre you seeing this?\u201d</p><p>Jenna didn\u2019t have to look up at him to know he was as freaked out as she was. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Once more, Richart\u2019s form solidified. He opened his eyes, spoke vehemently in French, then lurched forward. His knees buckled. Losing his battle with gravity, he crashed through her coffee table, reducing it to large splinters as he hit the floor hard.</p><p>Her heart now lodged in her throat, Jenna jerked away from John and knelt at Richart\u2019s side. \u201cRichart?\u201d</p><p>Rolling onto his back, he stared up at her with unfocused eyes. \u201cI left . . . her there,\u201d he whispered, those eyes\u2014dilated she could see now\u2014filling with moisture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she murmured, combing his damp hair back from his face.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI left her. They\u2019ll . . . kill her.\u201d A tear slid down his temple. His weapons thunked to the floor as his hands went limp. \u201cThey\u2019ll\u201d\u2014his eyes closed\u2014\u201ctear her . . . apart.\u201d</p><p>As Jenna watched in horror, he sighed. Then his chest rose no more. \u201cRichart?\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Burying her hands in his bloody shirt, she shook him. \u201cRichart?\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cRichart!\u201d</p><p>John knelt by her side. \u201cMom . . .\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak past the lump in her throat, she shoved her fingers against Richart\u2019s throat above his carotid artery. Seconds ticked by, passing as slowly as hours. Her vision wavered as tears filled her eyes and spilled over her lashes. \u201cI can\u2019t feel a pulse.\u201d Her breath hitched. \u201cI can\u2019t feel a pulse!\u201d</p><p>John shoved her hand away and pressed two fingers against Richart\u2019s neck.</p><p>She gripped Richart\u2019s arm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He lowered his ear to Richart\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh!\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>Whatever the hell this was, it wasn\u2019t happening. It couldn\u2019t be!</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d her son ordered harshly.</p><p>Jenna stared at Richart\u2019s face. How could he have come to mean so much to her in such a short time? The thought of losing him . . .</p><p>More tears welled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pulse,\u201d John blurted, face pinched as he sat up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Jenna rose onto her knees, hope a frightening force that lent her strength despite her trembling. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s slow as hell, but it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Elation filled her, rendering her weak again. \u201cWe have to call nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>He caught her wrist and stopped her before she could rise and lunge for the phone. \u201cAnd tell them what? That your vampire boyfriend needs medical attention?\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The V-word she had been trying her damnedest to avoid.</p><p>\u201cThere are no such things as vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProof of their existence is currently passed out on our living room floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a vampire,\u201d she denied.</p><p>\u201cHis eyes glowed and he had fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Fake fangs don\u2019t retract into your gums. Glowing contact lenses don\u2019t have an on/off switch.\u201d</p><p>She stared at her son, wanting to cling to denial a little longer.</p><p>\u201cAnd humans don\u2019t have pulses so slow as to be virtually undetectable,\u201d he pronounced.</p><p>\u201cBut he ate food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe vampires can eat food in real life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I realize how ludicrous that sounds, Mom, but . . . !\u201d He drew in a deep breath. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what the hell he is, but I do know what he isn\u2019t: human. And since the news hasn\u2019t been filled with vampire reports, I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s been keeping it a secret.\u201d</p><p>He had certainly been keeping it a secret from her.</p><p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t just leave him here,\u201d she said. He was wounded, badly, judging by all of the blood. He needed help.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me what we should do . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAs your son, my first instinct is to protect you by waiting for the sun to rise and shoving his ass out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. My second inclination\u2014again because you\u2019re my mom and I know you care about him\u2014is to do what I can to help him. Let\u2019s put him to bed and see if we can do anything about his wounds.\u201d</p><p>Jenna gave John a quick hug. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her back. \u201cI love you, too. I just hope we aren\u2019t making a huge mistake.\u201d</p><p>They stood. John kicked the daggers away from Richart\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cPut him in my room,\u201d Jenna instructed.</p><p>Offering no protest, John bent down, hoisted Richart over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s carry, and straightened. \u201cHoly crap he\u2019s heavy.\u201d He staggered toward the hallway.</p><p>Jenna ducked past them and hurried into her bedroom.</p><p>Grabbing the old, timeworn blanket at the foot of the bed, she threw it over the covers to protect them a bit from the blood. She stared as John deposited Richart\u2019s limp form on the bed.</p><p>Had Richart not canceled, she likely would have spent tonight making love with a vampire.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Get it together. \u201cRight.\u201d Moving forward, she tugged off Richart\u2019s boots.</p><p>John removed the long coat, then Jenna started on the buttons that ran down the front of Richart\u2019s black shirt. When she reached the last one and parted the material, both she and John gasped.</p><p>Richart\u2019s torso was a sticky red. His shoulder did indeed sport a bullet hole. The rest of him . . .</p><p>Puncture wounds, deep cuts, and gashes that must have been carved by blades as sharp as Richart\u2019s daggers marred much of his form.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even have what we need to bandage those, let alone close them,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cWhatever we need, go buy it,\u201d Jenna told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you here alone with him.\u201d</p><p>Jenna met his gaze. \u201cWe\u2019ve been alone together nearly every night this week and he hasn\u2019t harmed me. Do it. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he wakes up, wanting blood? You go. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn.\u201d Her tone offered no compromise.</p><p>He nodded, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down, and left the room.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, he returned, wearing a fresh sweatshirt, jacket, and jeans. He handed her a canister of pepper spray and one of Richart\u2019s daggers. \u201cIf he threatens you, hit him with the pepper spray, then carve him up.\u201d</p><p>Lovely.</p><p>Jenna took the weapons and kissed John on the cheek. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he left the room. A moment later, the front door closed.</p><p>And Jenna was left alone with the vampire she loved.</p><p>Jenna glanced at the clock for the hundredth time since John had left. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richart had not roused once. Not when she had finished undressing him. Not when she had sponge-bathed the blood from him. Not when she had attempted to clean his sticky, bloody hair. And not when she had worked a pair of John\u2019s boxers up Richart\u2019s long, muscled legs and over his . . .</p><p>Her gaze darted to his lap, covered now with a clean blanket.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen a naked man up close and personal in years. She had hoped to see Richart naked when the day had begun, but not like this.</p> <p>She rested her hand on his bare chest.</p><p>Warm. Weren\u2019t vampires supposed to be cold to the touch?</p><p>His chest rose slightly, then fell still once more.</p><p>The front door opened and closed. \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d John called. Moments later he entered the room, jacket zipped up tight against the cold, a shopping bag dangling from each hand.</p><p>\u201cDid you get everything you need?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Setting the bags down, he unzipped his jacket and tugged it off.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t get everything he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s a vampire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop calling him that. It\u2019s just too weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But, if he is one, he probably needs blood more than anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Jenna eyed Richart with dread. Did he really drink blood?</p><p>\u201cHas he moved at all?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But he still has that slow, faint pulse.\u201d</p><p>He spilled bandages, tubes, and bottles onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go wash up, then we can get started.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Yawning, Jenna focused gritty eyes on the clock again. It would be noon soon.</p><p>John slept in his bedroom. He had a final exam tomorrow and Jenna had insisted he get some rest.</p><p>Richart\u2019s chest rose and fell in another barely detectable breath.</p> <p>He still hadn\u2019t stirred. Nor had his wounds miraculously healed as they often did in movies.</p><p>Was John right? Did Richart need blood?</p><p>She thought of all the films and TV shows she\u2019d seen in which a human had slashed his or her wrist and held it over a vampire\u2019s mouth until he latched on and began to drink.</p><p>She was so not going to do that.</p><p>Not yet, an inner voice murmured.</p><p>Not ever, she insisted, but wondered if she would feel the same way if Richart still hadn\u2019t awakened by . . .</p><p>By when? Tomorrow? How long could they wait without trying something else?</p><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><p>Jenna jumped at the loud pounding on the front door.</p><p>Frowning, she rose and headed for the living room.</p><p>John shuffled out of his bedroom, sweatpants and T-shirt rumpled, hair sticking up on one side. \u201cIs he awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p><p>She nodded and continued into the living room and over to the door. Rising onto her toes, she peeked through the peephole.</p><p>A tall red-haired young man who looked to be her son\u2019s age stood there, shifting anxiously from foot to foot.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she called.</p><p>He straightened, eyes fastening on the peephole. \u201cHi. I\u2019m looking for Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheldon Shepherd, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Who the hell was that?</p><p>\u201cDo you know him?\u201d John whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d John demanded in a deep, hostile voice.</p><p>Jenna peeked through the peephole again.</p><p>Sheldon went still. \u201cI . . . ah . . . I\u2019d just like to talk with you for a moment, ma\u2019am, if that\u2019s all right. We . . . ah . . . we have a mutual friend who . . . with whom I\u2019ve lost contact and . . .\u201d He glanced around, frustration written all over his face.</p><p>Jenna lowered her heels to the floor. \u201cHe must be a friend of Richart\u2019s,\u201d she whispered and reached for the lock.</p><p>John caught her hand. \u201cOr he could be one of the people who hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s a friend, maybe he can help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Sheldon called.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Jenna called back.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d John said and hurried from the room. When he returned, he carried one of Richart\u2019s daggers. \u201cJust in case. No way am I going to let whoever cut him up cut you up.\u201d</p><p>He casually slid his arm a little behind his back so the blade wasn\u2019t visible.</p><p>Nerves jangling, Jenna opened the door.</p><p>Sheldon looked down at her. \u201cHi. Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He offered his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Sheldon. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jenna shook his hand, not getting any kind of danger vibes from him, but still on guard.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, ma\u2019am, but\u201d\u2014he looked to John, then met Jenna\u2019s gaze again\u2014\u201cmay I speak with you privately for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John said before she could answer.</p><p>Jenna shot John a warning glare. \u201cWhat is this about, Sheldon?\u201d</p><p>He looked from side to side and down to see if anyone was outside who might overhear them. Leaning forward a bit, he murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s about Richart. I don\u2019t want you to worry, but . . . something happened last night and I\u2019ve lost contact with him. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your relationship with Richart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m his nephew.\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through her. Richart had mentioned his nephew several times, but she didn\u2019t remember him ever calling him by name. \u201cCome in.\u201d She stepped back so Sheldon could enter and closed the door behind him. \u201cThis is my son, John.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon offered his hand to John, who shook it with reserve.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Richart?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to go into detail. It\u2019s highest level clearance only. In fact, I shouldn\u2019t even be here, but . . . Richart was . . . out on assignment last night and some problems arose. The situation deteriorated quickly. There was a lot of confusion and . . . I\u2019ve lost contact with him. I hoped you might have heard from him.\u201d He glanced around the room, his words slowing as he noticed the splintered coffee table, the bloody fistprint on the wall. \u201cI really need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d she announced, hoping her instincts were correct when they insisted he was friend and not foe.</p><p>Relief blanketed his features, though some wariness remained. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and motioned for him to follow her back to her bedroom. \u201cHe collapsed shortly after he . . . appeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean arrived?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean he just appeared. Out of thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. Okay. There\u2019s an explanation for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is,\u201d John drawled, bringing up the rear. \u201cHe\u2019s a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a vampire!\u201d Sheldon denied. \u201cWait. You guys believe in vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe sure as hell do now,\u201d John answered.</p><p>Jenna nodded as they entered the bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to after seeing Richart\u2019s glowing eyes and fangs.\u201d</p><p>Again he swore. \u201cYyyyyyeah. There\u2019s an explanation for that, too.\u201d</p><p>They surrounded Jenna\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cHas he regained consciousness?\u201d Sheldon asked as he leaned down and drew the covers back. Bandages and butterfly closures decorated most of Richart\u2019s torso.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jenna answered.</p><p>\u201cAre his wounds still bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Had she not seen Richart\u2019s fangs and eyes, she would have puzzled over that. She had not even needed to apply pressure to them. The bleeding had just . . . stopped.</p><p>Sheldon peeled back one of the bandages. The wound beneath was a few inches long with ragged edges held together by butterfly closures. A dark, ugly bruise surrounded it. \u201cIs this how it looked when you cleaned it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cShould it have healed by now?\u201d</p><p>He replaced the bandage and straightened. A full minute passed while he stared down at Richart. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he said finally. \u201cScrew protocol. Screw the rules.\u201d He met Jenna\u2019s gaze. \u201cYes, it should have healed by now. All of them should have at least partially healed by now, especially if you . . . I mean if he . . .\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cDrank my blood?\u201d</p><p>Heavy pause. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon spun on his heel and left the room. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d he called over his shoulder. A moment later the front door opened and closed.</p><p>John brought the dagger out from behind his back and slipped it in the bedside table\u2019s drawer. \u201cThis just keeps getting more and more surreal.\u201d</p><p>Jenna nodded and sat on the bed. \u201cIt was weird hearing him confirm it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually he said Richart wasn\u2019t a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he asked me if Richart drank my blood and said his wounds should have healed by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t get it either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sheldon returned in short order. Rapping his knuckles on the front door, he let himself in, then strode into the bedroom carrying a cooler and a duffle bag.</p><p>Jenna\u2019s stomach sank when he opened the cooler and drew out two bags of blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d John muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s going to drink that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>While Jenna watched in silence, Sheldon set up an IV and began siphoning blood into Richart\u2019s vein.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just . . . use his fangs?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sheldon gently peeled back Richart\u2019s upper lip enough to show her that he no longer sported fangs. \u201cCan\u2019t use them if they aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>A frown creased John\u2019s face as Sheldon exchanged the already empty bag with a full one. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it take longer for those bags to empty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Sheldon put the empty bag back in the cooler. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jenna stared at Richart, willing him to open his eyes and let them know this was helping. \u201cHas this never happened before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe injuries or the not waking up thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon sat in the chair John had carried in earlier from the breakfast nook. \u201cHe\u2019s been injured like this, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t lose consciousness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different this time?\u201d</p><p>Sheldon sighed and dragged a hand down over his face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be telling you any of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed. \u201cRichart should. But he can\u2019t. So I need you to do it for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think he may have been drugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one would take too long to explain.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cVampires can be drugged?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Sheldon broke off, muttered something under his breath. \u201cUntil tonight, no drugs affected him. At all. Period. If he drank five gallons of vodka and swallowed four bottles of sleeping pills, nothing would happen. He wouldn\u2019t get drunk. He wouldn\u2019t get loopy. He wouldn\u2019t get sleepy. And he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t die. He would feel exactly the same afterward as he did before. He would just need a little blood to replace what he lost while his body repaired the damage. But tonight . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cHe was hit with several darts carrying an unknown substance. The others hit with the same drug\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are others?\u201d Jenna asked, not knowing why that surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYes. They were transfused hours ago, right after it happened, and should have awoken immediately, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t stirred. This drug is something we\u2019ve never encountered before. We don\u2019t know if it was a tranquilizer, a poison, or what. We don\u2019t know why it affects them when nothing else does. And . . . we don\u2019t know how to help them.\u201d</p><p>Jenna swallowed hard. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t know if Richart is going to wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Sheldon said, voice filled with determination. \u201cHe has to.\u201d He replaced the second empty blood bag with another full one.</p><p>\u201cAre you really his nephew?\u201d she asked. Richart had withheld a lot of information from her. Had he lied outright, too?</p><p>\u201cNo, though I may as well be. He treats me like family because I\u2019m a descendent of his first Second. Damien was my great-great-I-don\u2019t-know-how-many-greats grandfather and was like a brother to him.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap. \u201cHow old is Richart?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cOld enough and mellow enough I hope to forgive me for not knowing how to keep my damned mouth shut. I\u2019ll let him tell you his age.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Richart hadn\u2019t cared about the age difference. He must have inwardly laughed his ass off when she had asked him if it bothered him that she was older than him.</p><p>Sheldon peeled back the bandage he had peered under earlier. The wound it covered shrank as they watched, dwindling to nothing as the bruise around it faded.</p><p>John moved closer. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Sheldon systematically removed all of the other bandages.</p><p>Had Jenna not seen the wounds with her own eyes, she would have never known Richart had been injured.</p><p>Sheldon retook his seat and caught Jenna\u2019s eye. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll cut him some slack over keeping this part of his life from you.\u201d</p><p>John snorted.</p><p>Jenna . . . didn\u2019t know what to think. She felt numbed by the shock of it all. \u201cHe knew how much I value honesty and chose to keep this from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t an easy secret to share.\u201d When she remained silent, he said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t cheat on you. He doesn\u2019t have a wife tucked away somewhere. He\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent. In a way that, when revealed, usually sparks violent reactions in others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014what\u2014he thought if he told me I\u2019d come after him with a torch-bearing mob and try to stake him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first to do so.\u201d</p><p>That was unsetting. \u201cPeople who found out what he is have tried to kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart and others of his kind, yes.\u201d He nodded at his uncle. \u201cWho do you think developed the drug he was hit with tonight?\u201d</p><p>Jenna stared down at Richart, her hip pressed to his.</p><p>His chest rose and fell more often. Not as often as a human\u2019s, but more than it had before.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Sheldon said, drawing her gaze, \u201cI know all this must have been a hell of a shock to you. I know you must be pissed, finding out that Richart isn\u2019t quite who you thought he was. But he\u2019s an honorable man, Jenna. If he weren\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have practically begged him to let me serve as his Second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used that term before,\u201d John said. \u201cWhat\u2019s a Second? Is that like his Renfield?\u201d</p><p>Jenna\u2019s head began to pound. Dracula had always had a human assistant, a Renfield as fans of the fictional figure had come to call him.</p><p>But Richart wasn\u2019t like Dracula. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess you could say that.\u201d</p><p>Crap.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, if you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment, I need to make a call. A lot of people are worried about Richart. I should let them know he\u2019s safe and tell them his condition.\u201d He rose. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask this earlier . . .\u201d He hesitated, as if he really didn\u2019t want to ask whatever it was.</p><p>Could things actually get worse?</p><p>\u201cDid Richart speak before he passed out?\u201d he finally queried.</p><p>\u201cYes. A little bit. Most of it was in French\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention someone named Ami?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He said he left her behind.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon gripped the back of the chair with a fist. A muscle in his jaw jumped.</p><p>Jenna remembered the torment in Richart\u2019s eyes, in his voice. They\u2019ll kill her. They\u2019ll tear her apart. \u201cHe tried to go back for her, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon lowered his head, raised a hand to rub his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe said they\u2019d kill her,\u201d she continued softly.</p><p>Head still down, Sheldon nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d Turning away, he headed out of the room. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Jenna saw her own concern reflected in her son\u2019s face. She glanced at the clock. \u201cWhen are you supposed to meet with your study group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should go. I think I should stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d worked his ass off all semester, balancing work and school. And the exam he\u2019d take tomorrow counted for sixty percent of his final grade. The partial scholarship that covered half his tuition was contingent upon his maintaining a high GPA. \u201cGo. Study. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Sheldon spoke softly in the living room. \u201cCam? It\u2019s Sheldon. I found him.\u201d</p><p>John looked toward the living room. \u201cIt isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t for you to decide,\u201d Jenna reminded him.</p><p>Again Sheldon spoke. \u201cI need you to keep this from Reordon if you can. Richart didn\u2019t want him to know. He\u2019s been seeing someone. I think the drug got his wires all crossed and he accidentally teleported to her place. . . . No. She cleaned him up and has been watching over him. . . . No . . . I\u2019m sure. She hasn\u2019t told anyone. Nor will she. She cares about him as much as he cares for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn,\u201d Jenna said firmly, \u201cgo. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve gotten myself into, but I\u2019m not going to let it threaten your future.\u201d He opened his mouth to protest. \u201cGo!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Sighing, he pointed to the drawer in which he\u2019d placed the dagger. \u201cIf you need it . . .\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He padded down the hallway to his bedroom, went inside, and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with him,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cNo, he\u2019s safe. No one else can track him here. Besides, you can\u2019t do anything for him there that we haven\u2019t already done for him here. . . . No way . . . I don\u2019t give a damn. Richart doesn\u2019t want Reordon anywhere near her. Why the hell do you think I\u2019m using a prepaid, untraceable cell phone? Richart would kick my ass from here to Antibes if I let any harm come to her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was Reordon Richart\u2019s enemy? Sheldon seemed to think she needed protection from him, whoever he was.</p><p>\u201cHave \u00c9tienne and Lisette regained consciousness?\u201d He swore. \u201cWhat about Roland and Marcus?\u201d</p><p>Jenna combed her fingers through Richart\u2019s hair. \u00c9tienne and Lisette were his brother and sister. He had spoken of them with great affection. She hated to hear that they, too, had been harmed.</p> <p>\u201cListen, there\u2019s something else,\u201d Sheldon said, voice somber. \u201cI think Ami may be dead. Apparently Richart tried to teleport her with him, but the drug was fucking with him too much and she didn\u2019t make it here. . . . What? . . . He did? . . . Uh-huh. . . . No, I didn\u2019t bring my cell with me. I didn\u2019t want Reordon to be able to locate me. I\u2019ll just call every hour to check in.\u201d</p><p>John returned to Jenna\u2019s bedroom, clothed in jeans and a heavy sweater with a book bag looped over his shoulder. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay with this? I don\u2019t feel right about leaving. I\u2019d rather risk losing my scholarship than risk losing you. You\u2019re more important.\u201d</p><p>Jenna crossed to him and leaned up to kiss his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Sheldon will be here with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, we don\u2019t know Sheldon from Adam. For all we know, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust him,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried, just call me in a while to see how things are going.\u201d</p> <p>He groaned. \u201cFine. But if you don\u2019t answer, I\u2019m hauling ass back here with reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, honey. Study hard.\u201d</p><p>Rolling his eyes, he left the room. \u201cIf anything happens to her,\u201d she heard him tell Sheldon as he passed him in the hallway, \u201cI\u2019ll hunt you motherfuckers down and laugh while I feed you your own entrails.\u201d</p><p>Jenna leaned into the hallway and stared at her son\u2019s back with wide eyes. She had never heard him sound so menacing.</p><p>\u201cDude,\u201d Sheldon responded, \u201cvampires threaten to feed me my own entrails all the time. You\u2019re going to have to come up with something better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll cut off your balls, shove them down your throat, and watch you choke on them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do.\u201d Sheldon shuddered. \u201cOkay, I see we\u2019re going to have to have a little talk, John. Here\u2019s the thing. Since Richart is planning to explore the Kama Sutra with your mom, if she forgives him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d John said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to put that image in my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . you and I are going to be running into each other a lot, so you need to understand something,\u201d he said earnestly. \u201cYou can\u2019t threaten a man\u2019s balls, dude. A man\u2019s balls are off limits. Even vampires don\u2019t fuck with a man\u2019s balls. That\u2019s just . . . mean.\u201d</p><p>John glanced at Jenna.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cStill think I\u2019m in danger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Go study.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, John left.</p> <p>Sheldon met Jenna in the doorway. \u201cI know you\u2019re probably just as concerned as he is, but I won\u2019t let any harm come to you, Jenna. And I promise I\u2019m not here to harm you myself. If I let you get so much as a paper cut, Richart would hang my ass out to dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem very loyal to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give my life to protect him. And, since he cares for you, that means I\u2019d give my life to protect you, too.\u201d His voice rang with sincerity.</p><p>Jenna nodded. \u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cNow . . . we wait.\u201d</p><p>Richart bit back a groan. Some asshole was mowing his lawn or trimming his hedges or juggling fucking chainsaws in rhythmic intervals. On. Off. On. Off. On. Off. The noise assaulted his ears in perfect accompaniment to the pounding that made his head feel like someone was hitting him repeatedly in the forehead with a snow shovel.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>He tried to open his eyes and found his lids too heavy to lift.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Richart,\u201d Jenna whispered in his ear. Her delicate fingers delivered soothing strokes to one of his hands.</p><p>Had he fallen asleep at Jenna\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cWake up, Richart,\u201d she repeated in those same warm tones.</p><p>The buzz sawing grew louder. The pain in his head intensified.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Richart,\u201d she said once more, amusement creeping in. \u201cBecause, if you don\u2019t, I might have to smother Sheldon to get him to stop snoring.\u201d</p><p>Had he the strength, he would have laughed.</p><p>Then her words sank in. Sheldon was here? What was Sheldon doing here?</p><p>Where was here? His mind was all foggy.</p><p>Had he and Jenna spent her night off at his place? All of the things he had planned to do to that lovely body of hers and he had fallen asleep? Sheldon must have laughed his ass off when he had gotten home.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Richart. I need to know you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>He tried again to force his eyelids open.</p><p>Her hand tightened on his as she combed her fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Open your eyes for me.\u201d</p><p>At last, he succeeded and tried to bring his surroundings into focus.</p><p>What was wrong with his eyes?</p><p>What was wrong with him? Why couldn\u2019t he think straight or hold on to a thought for more than a fleeting second?</p><p>As his vision cleared, he realized he lay in Jenna\u2019s bed, a blanket drawn up to his waist, leaving his chest bare. His Second was sprawled in a chair across the room, legs straight, feet splayed, arms dangling over the chair\u2019s arms, head back, mouth gaping as he emitted periodic snores.</p><p>At least I\u2019ve located the damned chainsaw.</p><p>Daylight framed the closed blinds on the only window the room boasted. A discarded IV stand sporting an empty bag of blood stood sentinel beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cRichart?\u201d Jenna sat beside him, her hip a gentle pressure against his. Faint signs of fatigue lined her pretty face.</p><p>He curled his fingers around hers, still trying to find his voice.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It took a couple of attempts to coax sound to emerge. \u201cLike I have the worst hangover ever. What happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSheldon wouldn\u2019t tell me what happened before you got here, just that you were out on assignment and something went terribly wrong. John and I were having dinner here last night when you suddenly . . .\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cIt feels so weird to say this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . teleported into the living room.\u201d</p><p>Alarm surged through him.</p><p>\u201cSporting fangs.\u201d</p><p>He clamped his lips shut.</p><p>\u201cDrenched in blood.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>\u201cWith glowing eyes.\u201d</p><p>Every curse word he knew in every language he had ever learned paraded through his mind.</p><p>She knew. At least part of it anyway. \u201cYou called Sheldon?\u201d he asked, avoiding her gaze.</p><p>\u201cNo. Your cell phone was shattered in whatever fight left you so torn up. He came looking for you around noon.\u201d</p><p>She knew.</p><p>John knew.</p><p>She\u2019d never forgive him.</p><p>Fear-induced adrenaline surged through him, finally resurrecting a few memories.</p><p>The ambush. The vampire king. The darts.</p><p>Grabbing the pillow from behind his head, he threw it at his somnolent Second\u2019s slack face.</p><p>Feet flying up, Sheldon snorted and jackknifed into a seated position. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it!\u201d His eyes sought and found Richart. \u201cOh, shit. You\u2019re awake. Man, you had me worried.\u201d He crossed to the bed.</p><p>Richart squeezed Jenna\u2019s hand and pulled himself up into a seated position. The room tilted. Dark clouds invaded his vision and swirled around before clearing as the dizziness ebbed. \u201c\u00c9tienne and Lisette?\u201d</p><p>Jenna moved to sit at his side and wrapped an arm around him for support.</p><p>A tiny spark of hope flared. She wouldn\u2019t do that if she hated or feared him, would she?</p><p>\u201cAs of half an hour ago, they still haven\u2019t regained consciousness,\u201d Sheldon said, \u201cbut their wounds have healed like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoland and Marcus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re awake, but not at full strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmi?\u201d</p><p>The younger man\u2019s gaze darted to Jenna and back. He raised his eyebrows in question, silently asking if he should speak freely.</p><p>\u201cJust say it. I\u2019m going to tell her everything as soon as you leave anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampire king or one of his followers captured her.\u201d</p><p>Dread flooded Richart\u2019s stomach like acid.</p><p>\u201cBastien tracked their scents to Carrboro and lost them,\u201d Sheldon continued, \u201cbut Marcus went after her as soon as he woke up and found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>Sheldon nodded.</p><p>\u201cIn what condition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Last I heard Darnell was heading over to Marcus\u2019s place to check on her. I\u2019m sure Seth has been called in by now to heal her.\u201d</p><p>Richart dropped his legs over the side of the bed and braced his bare feet on the carpet. Leaning forward, he propped his elbows on his knees and dropped his head into his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Sheldon told him.</p><p>Richart shook his head. \u201cI should have stayed. I shouldn\u2019t have teleported that last time. I thought I could take her away from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had stayed, you would have died.\u201d</p> <p>And Ami still would have wound up in the vampires\u2019 hands. The vampire-hunting profession was very good at producing no-win situations. \u201cGo home and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should leave you. You aren\u2019t at full strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Richart insisted, his tone offering Sheldon no wiggle room. \u201cI\u2019ll be along in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you can\u2019t teleport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you and you can drag your ass back and give me a ride. Or, if the sun has set, I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p> <p>Nodding, Sheldon grabbed a piece of paper and pen from the bedside table and scribbled something down. Once finished, he handed the scrap to Jenna. \u201cHere\u2019s a number where you can reach me. If he needs anything, call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jenna took his Second\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, Sheldon.\u201d</p><p>Bobbing his head, Sheldon gave her hand a squeeze, scrutinized Richart one last time, then backed out of the room. The front door opened and closed, then they were alone.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Silence descended upon the room, heavy with things unsaid.</p><p>\u201cIt belatedly occurs to me,\u201d Richart began rustily, \u201cthat I should have asked you if you wished me to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She added nothing more. Nor did she move away, sitting close behind him on the bed.</p><p>Richart found himself at a loss. He didn\u2019t know how to do this. How to reveal all of his secrets. How to coax a human into accepting him without fear or loathing. A human whose scorn he couldn\u2019t bear to face.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you look at me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Richart rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, hoping it would help clear his head and ease the pain it housed. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTried to find a way to tell the woman I love that I\u2019m not human.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cTried to find the right words to convince her not to fear me or revile me after letting her see me at my worst, covered in blood, with my damned eyes glowing and my fangs bared. What you must think of me . . .\u201d Rising shakily, he braced a hand on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cMy head is fucking killing me.\u201d He cupped his throbbing forehead in a palm. \u201cForgive me. I didn\u2019t mean to speak so crudely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said worse, stuck in traffic.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. Only Jenna could make him smile when things looked so damned grim. It was one of the reasons he loved her despite all of the monumental obstacles littering their path. \u201cYou know what the ironic thing is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this battle had not taken place, I would have told you everything last night.\u201d</p><p>The bedding rustled as Jenna rose on the other side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds like I\u2019m just saying that to cover my ass, but it was your night off. If we couldn\u2019t be alone here, I was going to boot Sheldon out of my place and . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI wanted so badly to make love to you, but didn\u2019t feel right doing so without first telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>Jenna circled the bed and stood no more than a foot away from him. \u201cIs that why you held back whenever we . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissed?\u201d He studied her beautiful face, following the lovely line of her neck down to her full breasts. \u201cTouched?\u201d Despite the lethargy that plagued him, Richart felt his pulse leap and his body harden as memories of slipping his hands beneath her shirt, unfastening her bra, and filling his palms with that soft, silky flesh flitted through his mind. Dragging the cloth up and closing his lips over the tights buds. Hearing her moan and feeling her clutch him tightly in response.</p><p>Squeezing his eyes closed, he turned his head aside.</p><p>\u201cRichart? What\u2019s wrong? Is it your head?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they hurting?\u201d</p><p>This was so not the time for his nature to assert itself. \u201cNo, it\u2019s . . .\u201d A huff of frustration escaped him. \u201cThey glow when I\u2019m in the grips of strong emotion and\u2014trust me when I say I realize now is not the time for this\u2014but just the thought of making love with you . . .\u201d</p><p>He jumped when her small, cool fingers touched his jaw and turned his face back toward her.</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d she coaxed.</p><p>He did as bidden.</p><p>Her hazel eyes brightened, illuminated by the amber glow emanating from his own.</p><p>She raised her other hand, cupped his face in both, and studied him with such painful intensity that he forgot to breathe. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A lump rose in his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t fear me, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>Amusement lit her features. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to be afraid of a vampire who apologizes for using harsh language in front of a lady.\u201d</p><p>Could he really be so lucky? \u201cI\u2019m not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not a lady.\u201d She motioned to the bed. \u201cStop worrying about how I\u2019ll react, sit down before you fall down, and explain all of this to me.\u201d She started to step back, then paused. \u201cWait. Scratch that. I need to do something first.\u201d Slipping her arms around his waist, she pressed her face to his chest and hugged him close.</p><p>Heart pounding, Richart wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cThere was a moment last night,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwhen I thought you were dead. You lost consciousness and your chest stopped rising. I couldn\u2019t find a pulse.\u201d Her hold tightened. \u201cI\u2019ve only felt that overwhelming despair and helplessness once in my life, when police showed up at my door and told me John\u2019s father had been killed in a car accident.\u201d She burrowed closer, her breath warm on his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to feel that way again.\u201d</p><p>Richart buried his face in her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Many long moments passed while they clung to each other.</p><p>Sighing, Jenna loosened her hold and looked up at him. \u201cFeelings that deep aren\u2019t going to dissolve overnight because I found out your eyes are prettier and your teeth are sharper than I thought they were.\u201d</p><p>Richart dipped his head and captured her lips with his own, pouring everything he felt into the contact until both were breathless.</p><p>When she placed a hand on his chest and applied gentle pressure, he reluctantly withdrew.</p><p>\u201cI need you to explain everything to me before we get too distracted.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he sank onto the bed, stretched his legs out, and leaned back against the headboard, then pulled her down beside him, catching and holding her hand.</p><p>\u201cNow they\u2019re even brighter,\u201d she said, her eyes locking on his with fascination.</p><p>\u201cYou do that to me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve had a hell of a time hiding it from you.\u201d</p><p>Swiveling to face him, she sat with her legs crossed and toyed with his fingers. \u201cSo . . . how old are you?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cTwo hundred and thirty.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI feel so stupid for making such a big deal out of being older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t. I was the one who feared you would reject me if you knew my true age.\u201d</p><p>She offered him a small smile. \u201cI won\u2019t lie. If you actually looked your age, I wouldn\u2019t have given you a second glance.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld and young at the same time?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAnd not be a vampire? I mean, the fangs . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m infected with a virus. A very rare symbiotic virus that behaves like no other on the planet. We don\u2019t know where it originated. We know only that it first conquers, then replaces the immune system, lending those infected with it far greater strength, speed, and regenerative capabilities. It heightens our senses, causes extreme photosensitivity, and . . . we don\u2019t age. Essentially, we are immortal, and call ourselves such.\u201d</p><p>Jenna stared at him, her thoughts reeling. \u201cA virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, one that can only be transmitted through a bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you drink blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do require frequent infusions of blood. The virus depletes my body\u2019s supply as it repairs damage. But I don\u2019t drink it. During my transformation, I grew a pair of retractable fangs that function like IV needles. When I bite into a blood bag, my fangs siphon the blood directly into my veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever bite people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all did before we were able to collect and store blood donations in our own blood banks. But we never frightened or killed the donors.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cWell, not unless they were fiends who preyed upon the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re an immortal, not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sheldon mentioned a vampire king, so vampires do exist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. I was different from other humans even before I was infected, as were my brother and sister and all of our immortal brethren. We called ourselves gifted ones. We didn\u2019t know it then and still don\u2019t know why, but our DNA is more advanced\u2014a great deal more advanced\u2014than that of ordinary humans.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s why I can teleport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a result of the virus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I could teleport as a child. My brother and sister are both telepathic. Some can heal with their hands. Others can move things with their minds. The eldest of us can do far more.\u201d He toyed with her hand. \u201cAs you said, vampires do exist. They are ordinary humans who have been infected with the same virus. They lack our special abilities and, without the protection our advanced DNA affords us, suffer progressive brain damage that causes a rapid descent into madness. They prey upon humans, inflicting upon their victims every monstrous impulse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow have I never heard of this?\u201d she asked in disbelief. \u201cHow have none of us ever heard of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmortals hunt vampires and destroy them. It\u2019s what we do, every night, to eradicate the threat and to prevent the public from learning of our existence and theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, why don\u2019t the vampires\u2019 victims report it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have no memory of the attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou erase their memories?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Small glands above our fangs\u2014and the fangs of vampires\u2014release a chemical that behaves much like GHB under the pressure of a bite. If the victim lives, he or she will have no memory of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just having a hard time believing that.\u201d</p><p>He looked away. \u201cDo you remember the first night we met, Jenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You came into the store and asked me where to find Krazy Glue.\u201d</p><p>When next he met her gaze, his eyes had returned to their usual brown. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the first night we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few weeks before that, I was hunting in the area\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And found . . . you. You must have just come off your shift. Four vampires had swept you behind the building and cornered you.\u201d</p><p>Her blood went cold. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fought and pepper-sprayed one, but were bitten by another before I could wrest you from him.\u201d</p><p>Horror filled her. Somehow this revelation was worse than anything that had come before it. She had been attacked? By vampires? And had no memory of it? \u201cThat isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a night, was there not, a few weeks before we met in which you couldn\u2019t remember leaving work the night before, driving home, or putting yourself to bed?\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. There had been. She had awoken in her bed, still wearing her work clothes, and hadn\u2019t been able to remember how she had gotten there. It had all been a blank. She had ultimately chalked it up to exhaustion.</p> <p>\u201cI was attacked by vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d How could he keep something like that from her?</p><p>\u201cJenna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was attacked, Richart! You should have told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he asked helplessly.</p><p>\u201cEasy. You should have said, Jenna, I know this is going to sound strange, but you were attacked by vampires and I rescued\u2014okay, I see your point. I would have thought you were off your rocker.\u201d She rubbed a shaking hand over her face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Did they . . . ? What did they do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than the bite, you were unharmed. They must have just taken you when I came upon you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I infected?\u201d If all Richart had said was true, she would turn into a psychotic vampire if she transformed. She didn\u2019t have the special DNA needed to make her immortal. She couldn\u2019t read minds or teleport or see the future or whatever else they could do.</p><p>\u201cNo. A single brief bite won\u2019t turn you. You would either have to be bitten fairly often over a stretch of time or have your blood drained until you were on the brink of death, then be infused wholly with infected blood.\u201d</p><p>And the vampire had only bitten her the once. Briefly.</p><p>Richart covered the hand she had braced on the mattress with one of his. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She met his concerned gaze. \u201cI\u2019m freaked out over being attacked and having no memory of it. That\u2019s really scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2014what\u2014killed them Blade-style?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAll but one, who got away, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne got away?\u201d Panic shrieked through her. \u201cWhat if he came back? What if he bit me again and I just can\u2019t remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you experienced missing time again? Have there been any blank spots you couldn\u2019t recall?\u201d</p><p>She thought hard, trying to think of any other instances. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But how can I be sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been guarding you,\u201d he admitted, seeming almost ashamed.</p><p>\u201cGuarding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used speed and stealth to obtain your work schedule and have been at the store every night when you arrived and departed in case he returned and tried to harm you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cEvery night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he likely to return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He would have done so before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you continued to watch over me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAt least you said watched. Sheldon kept accusing me of stalking you.\u201d</p><p>She supposed some would see that as stalking. To Jenna, it seemed sweet. He had been protecting her all this time. \u201cSo . . . that\u2019s everything then?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it! What else could there be? You\u2019re immortal. I was attacked by vampires. Vampires nearly killed you last night. You can teleport. What are you going to tell me now? That Sheldon is a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheldon isn\u2019t a werewolf, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, what?\u201d She wondered how many times she would feel this gut-churning dread before the day ended. \u201cDid you ask me out because you were trying to lure the vampire out of hiding?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cNo! Of course not. I asked you out because the night I rescued you you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cI kissed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You were grateful that I saved you. You were drugged by the vampire\u2019s bite, so your inhibitions were lowered and . . . you kissed me.\u201d His eyes began to glow again.</p><p>Why did that make her heart pound? \u201cPlease tell me it wasn\u2019t a sloppy, drunken kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not a sloppy, drunken kiss. It was sweet and erotic all at once and I was captivated. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you afterward. Days went by. Then weeks. I watched over you. Watched you come and go. Listened to you chat with your colleagues. And, when I couldn\u2019t keep my distance any longer, I gave in to temptation and . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsked me where to find the Krazy Glue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes are glowing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Even with my ears filled with cotton and a sledgehammer assaulting my head, I want you.\u201d</p><p>And she wanted him. Despite everything. Or because of everything. She would decide which later.</p><p>Richart watched Jenna, waiting for condemnation, acceptance, a Can we talk about this later? I need time to think. Anything that would give him a clue to her thoughts.</p><p>She rose onto her knees and scooted closer. Slinging a leg across his own, she straddled his lap.</p><p>Lust slammed through him as she settled upon the erection barely concealed by his boxers. Clarity came with it, finally erasing the fuzz the drug had induced.</p><p>Clamping his hands on her tempting ass, deliciously clad in tight yoga pants, he leaned forward and ravaged her lips with his own. She responded with all of the heat and urgency that seized him, parting her lips and inviting him within. Richart thrust his tongue forward, teasing and tasting hers as his heart slammed against his ribs.</p><p>\u201cI hated keeping secrets from you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI understand why you did.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the hem of her sweatshirt and drew it over her head.</p><p>Her hair crackled with static electricity and clung to him as he wrapped his arms around her mostly bare form. So soft and warm and his.</p><p>He reached behind her and unfastened her bra. \u201cHave I mentioned I haven\u2019t done this in a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either. It\u2019s been years for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me it\u2019s been decades.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows flew up. \u201cDecades? But . . . you\u2019re so gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAs are you.\u201d Drawing the lacy material down, he revealed pale breasts with hard pink tips. \u201cHuman males are idiots.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh turned into a gasp as he leaned forward and drew a taut bud into his mouth, sucking, nipping, and stroking it with his tongue.</p><p>Jenna tunneled her fingers through his hair as fire invaded her. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up for this?\u201d she forced herself to ask between gasps. The man had almost died, after all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you can feel that I am.\u201d</p><p>She certainly could and rocked against him, thigh muscles bunching as pleasure darted through her. \u201cI meant . . .\u201d She moaned as he slid one hand up to cup her other breast and knead it before his fingers went to work on the sensitive tip. \u201cI meant . . . your head . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head aches,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t care less.

She loved him.</p><p>He trailed kisses down her neck, her chest, stroking one breast, then the other as he rose onto his knees.

All muscle and sinew. Strong and perfect.</p><p>She felt a moment of insecurity.

His mouth was so warm, his tongue doing things she didn\u2019t even know a tongue could do until ecstasy exploded within her.</p><p>Crying out, she rode the wave as Richart continued to play, prolonging her orgasm, then sending her off into another.</p><p>Panting, she collapsed against the sheets.</p><p>Richart rose above her, his expression fierce and triumphant and full of longing.</p><p>Jenna planted a hand on his chest and gave him a little push. He fell back, watching her with those hypnotic amber eyes as she rose and straddled his knees.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d she said, then grasped his heavy erection and engaged in a little play of her own, stroking, squeezing, reveling in every groan she elicited.</p><p>\u201cJenna.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she lowered her head and closed her mouth around the warm soft tip. He moaned and muttered something in French.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t done this in a very long time, but any concern she felt that she might not be doing it well fled when he tunneled his fingers through her hair and urged her on.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His pleasure sparked a return of hers. She loved the way he tasted, the way he reacted to every long draw, every stroke of her tongue. And she loved the ecstasy that swept his handsome features as he came hard, calling her name.</p><p>Easing up to lie beside him, she watched the rapid rise and fall of his chest.</p><p>He turned his head, met her gaze. \u201cThat was incredible.\u201d Rolling onto his side, he smiled. \u201cMy headache is gone.\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, brushed her lips with his. \u201cVery good. Because I\u2019m not finished with you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught as he fondled her breast. \u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, a mischievous gleam entering his glowing eyes as he slid his hand down her stomach to the heart of her and teased the sensitive nub hidden there.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have thought she would be able to orgasm again, but the need that rapidly rose told her otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet,\u201d he whispered, rising up to settle between her thighs. \u201cI want to be inside you the next time you come.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him. \u201cAnd I want you there.\u201d</p><p>Richart stared down at Jenna\u2019s pretty face, flushed with pleasure. Positioning his cock at her entrance, he slid inside.</p><p>She was warm and tight and delightfully eager.</p><p>She slid her hands down to grip his ass.</p><p>Richart lowered his head to take her lips once more, kneaded her breast as he withdrew, then drove home again. And again. And again. The pleasure once more rising. Even better this time with her body clutching his.</p><p>He had known it would be like this. All those nights he had imagined being right here, moving inside Jenna, his feet hanging off the too-short bed, he had known it would be better than anything he had ever experienced before. And, when she threw back her head and cried out as another orgasm claimed her, her inner muscles tightening convulsively around him and driving him into his own, he knew he was lost. There would never be another for him.</p><p>Jenna was it. She was the one.</p><p>Rolling to his side, Richart held her close.</p><p>And tried not to think what the future would hold for them.</p><p>The weeks that followed were perhaps the most blissful of Jenna\u2019s life. She and Richart were inseparable. When they weren\u2019t working, they were together. When he was working and she was at home, they talked on the phone or texted, pausing only long enough for him to slay vampires, which was bizarre.</p><p>She learned something new about him every day. None of it frightened her, though, despite his concern that each revelation would be too much, that this or that would be the thing that was just too weird for her.</p><p>One night Richart hefted her effortlessly onto his back and raced through the countryside at preternatural speeds. It was scary and exhilarating and so much fun. Richart could outrun cars. And did so just to impress her, his eyes sparkling with boyish pleasure as she laughed.</p><p>He made her feel like a teenager again. Carefree and young, despite the fatigue that pulled at her. Working all night and playing with Richart nearly all day was taking its toll. But it was totally worth it.</p><p>They never spoke of the future. Never discussed what might happen to their relationship long-term. What would happen when she began to age and he stayed young.</p><p>He had mentioned once that, if she wished, she could have her DNA tested to see if she could be transformed without turning vampire. Jenna suspected he hadn\u2019t mentioned it again because he feared what the test may reveal and wanted to hold on to hope for just a little longer.</p><p>The fact that she was actually a brunette seemed to please him. Jenna had been dyeing her hair off and on ever since she had begun to go gray prematurely at the age of twenty. An overwhelming majority of gifted ones apparently had black hair. He did know of two, however, who had brown hair.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked her if she wanted to be transformed, probably because it wasn\u2019t as easy a decision to make as one might think. If she were transformed, Jenna would outlive her son, the grandchildren he would give her in the future, and their grandchildren, too.</p><p>Shaking off the somber thoughts, Jenna finished washing the breakfast dishes and dried her hands on the towel hanging beside the sink.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is Richart coming over?\u201d John asked, still poring over one of his textbooks at the table. He wouldn\u2019t have to leave for his first class for another hour.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He said it might be a late night and didn\u2019t want to talk because his sister and another immortal were with him and would overhear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d</p><p>In the next breath, Richart appeared in the living room. He wore his usual vampire hunting togs: black shirt, black pants, long black coat, daggers and throwing stars in every loop and pocket and sheath. Smudges of blood adorned his upper lip and chin, as if someone had punched him hard enough to break his nose. His eyes glowed a vibrant amber. His features, when he caught and held her gaze, bore an intensity that sucked the breath from her lungs.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jenna asked, closing the distance between them.</p><p>Looping an arm around her waist, he yanked her to him and claimed her lips in a long, passionate kiss.</p><p>Jenna forgot everything as fire burned through her and every nerve ending sprang to life. Forgot the blood on his chin. Forgot the weapons weighing him down and poking her as he pressed her against him. Forgot her son.</p><p>By the time Richart raised his head, she was as breathless as though she had just run the 400-meter relay.</p><p>Richart looked over her shoulder and nodded abruptly. \u201cJohn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d John said, sounding stunned.</p><p>\u201cExcuse us, please.\u201d As soon as Richart finished the husky proclamation, he whisked them to his bedroom in his home.</p><p>Jenna had no time to ask him what was wrong. He went to work, removing their clothing at preternatural speeds. His kiss was fierce, his hands aggressive in their exploration of her, turning her body to liquid fire.</p><p>Richart said nothing, the need to touch Jenna, to feel her against him, overwhelming. He was so desperate for her. He worried he might be hurting her until she wrapped her legs around him and begged for more.</p><p>Tossing her onto the bed, he dove after her. There was little foreplay this time. He needed her too much. As soon as he felt how wet she was for him, he sank inside, taking her fast and hard with strong, powerful strokes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna clutched Richart closer, panting, pleasure rising. His touch contained a hint of desperation, a roughness that had never been there before and excited her above and beyond. She cried out as ecstasy consumed her, reveled in hearing her name on Richart\u2019s lips as he came soon after.</p><p>Her muscles went limp.</p><p>Richart sank down on her, forearms braced on the bed to keep the bulk of his weight off of her. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It was fantastic.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, face buried in the crook of her neck, and rolled them to their sides, still joined.</p><p>Jenna waited for her heartbeat to slow its frantic pace. Richart never loosened his hold on her, cradling her close.</p><p>\u201cDid something happen at work today?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>A moment passed. \u201cWe lost some good people tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She rubbed his back in soothing strokes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bad. Like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen. We had no warning.\u201d He loosened his hold and relaxed a little, resting his head beside hers on the pillow so their noses almost touched. \u201cYou know the immortal I always complain about having to hunt with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s in love with a mortal and almost lost her today. I was with him while he sat there, agonizing and blaming himself, waiting to hear if . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI just kept thinking . . . what if it were me? What if it were us? What if you had been harmed?\u201d He stroked her face with gentle fingers. \u201cI love you, Jenna.\u201d</p><p>Her throat thickened.</p><p>\u201cI know it may seem too soon,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t. Not for her.</p><p>\u201cBut I love you. I do.\u201d</p><p>Jenna pressed a hand to his jaw and smoothed her thumb across his stubbled cheek. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, turned his face into her touch. \u201cThe thought of losing you was too much. I needed to hold you. To lose myself in you.\u201d He urged her closer. \u201cI just needed to be with you.\u201d</p><p>She could live with that.</p><p>Quiet enfolded them.</p><p>The corners of his lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI think we may have shocked John.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSomehow I think this won\u2019t be the last time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI think you may be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. You spending the day with Jenna?\u201d Sheldon asked as Richart donned his coat.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You guys have a fight or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel guilty,\u201d Richart confessed. \u201cShe works long hours all night, then I keep her up most of the day. It\u2019s wearing on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMentally or physically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically. She tries to hide it, but she\u2019s exhausted. There are circles under her eyes. She keeps getting headaches. And she\u2019s so run down she\u2019s caught that flu that\u2019s going around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. Try to get her to go to sleep earlier.\u201d</p><p>Richart smiled wryly. \u201cI always intend to, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Sheldon smiled. \u201cI hear ya. Hey, do you want me to make her some chicken soup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve tasted your chicken soup. I want her to feel better not worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass.\u201d</p><p>Richart teleported to Jenna\u2019s living room and found John waiting for him.</p><p>John raised a finger to his lips, then motioned for Richart to accompany him outside.</p><p>Puzzled, Richart followed him out onto the landing and waited while he closed the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d John said without preamble.</p><p>Richart frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk Mom into seeing that doctor you mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Lipton? I already tried once. Jenna said doctors can\u2019t do anything for the flu unless they catch it in the first twenty-four to forty-eight hours, that it just needs to run its course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the flu. It\u2019s been two weeks.\u201d</p><p>Richart nodded. \u201cDr. Lipton mentioned that some of her colleagues who came down with it took a couple of weeks to recover, that it was quite a nasty strain.\u201d Richart hadn\u2019t been sick in over two centuries, so he relied on Dr. Lipton and Jenna to apprise him of how these things usually went.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you,\u201d John insisted, \u201cthis isn\u2019t the flu. It\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d Jenna seemed sure.</p><p>\u201cBecause Mom doesn\u2019t get the flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never had it before?\u201d Wasn\u2019t the flu fairly common among humans?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying she doesn\u2019t get sick. Period.\u201d</p><p>Alarm bells sounded. \u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver. She\u2019s never even had a cold. Not that I can remember.\u201d</p><p>Jenna sure as hell hadn\u2019t told him that. \u201cShe had food poisoning a month ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s what that was.\u201d John looked away, jaw clenching and unclenching. \u201cLook, I like you, Richart, and I don\u2019t want there to be any tension between us for Mom\u2019s sake, but I have to ask. . . . Have you been biting her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hell, no. She had already been bitten once by the vampire who had attacked her that first night. Any more bites and she would have become more susceptible to . . .</p><p>Merde.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking because I know you said vampirism is caused by a virus and that frequent exposure . . .\u201d He stared at Richart. \u201cWhat? What is it? Your eyes are glowing.\u201d</p><p>Was it possible? Could she have been bitten again without him realizing it?</p><p>When? He was always there when she reached and left work. And any shopping she needed to do she did during daylight hours.</p><p>\u201cHave any of your mother\u2019s friends or work colleagues dropped by after dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you brought any friends home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy study group takes turns meeting at each other\u2019s places. They\u2019ve been over here a few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt night? After Jenna got home from work, while I was still out hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>Cursing, Richart practically tore the door off its hinges in his hurry to get inside.</p><p>Clad in a T-shirt and striped pajama bottoms, Jenna looked up, pallid face brightening, when he burst into her bedroom. \u201cHi.\u201d Her smile faded as he sat beside her on the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me a moment.\u201d Leaning in close, Richart buried his face in her neck just above her carotid artery. He drew in a deep breath. Held it. Found her scent. But not the scent he feared most.</p><p>\u201cRichart?\u201d Concern crept into her voice.</p><p>As John entered the room, Richart leaned back and palmed one of his daggers. \u201cI need you to trust me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she answered, winning his heart all over again.</p><p>Taking her hand, he pressed the tip of the dagger to her palm and applied just enough pressure to produce a tiny nick. A single bead of blood welled.</p><p>Richart raised her hand until it almost touched his nose, again drawing in a deep breath.</p><p>And there it was. The virus.</p><p>A growl rumbled deep in his throat.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cRichart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re infected.\u201d</p><p>John took a step forward.</p><p>Jenna stared up at Richart, fever blazing in her eyes. \u201cInfected with what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampiric virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I told you. It\u2019s the flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can smell it, Jenna. You\u2019re infected.\u201d</p><p>Her face grew paler. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You\u2019ve never bitten me. I haven\u2019t blacked out. And you\u2019ve been watching over me at the store.\u201d</p><p>He would figure it out later, after he took her to the network doctors. If she was this sick already . . .</p><p>He swallowed. It may be too late to prevent a transformation.</p><p>Rising, he wrapped the blankets around her and scooped her up into his arms.</p><p>John stepped forward. \u201cWherever you\u2019re going, I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>Though teleporting two at a time would sap his energy, Richart didn\u2019t argue. \u201cGrab my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>A second later they stood in Dr. Lipton\u2019s office.</p><p>Weakness struck. He staggered to the right, bumping into John.</p><p>John tightened his grip and helped Richart remain upright. \u201cYou okay, man?\u201d</p><p>Leaning over her desk, Dr. Melanie Lipton jumped and spun around. \u201cRichart. Hi. What\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna\u2019s infected.\u201d</p><p>Melanie paled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks I\u2019m infected,\u201d Jenna corrected. \u201cI think it\u2019s the flu.\u201d</p><p>Melanie met Richart\u2019s grim gaze and motioned for them to follow her. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the infirmary.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Jenna did everything she could to convince herself that Richart was wrong, that it was just a bad case of the flu. Hadn\u2019t Debbie even come down with it? And Jed in Lawn and Garden? Harry in Automotive?</p><p>But it was hard to ignore the looks Richart and Dr. Lipton kept exchanging. Looks that said Jenna was screwed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasure to meet you, Jenna,\u201d Dr. Lipton said as Richart lowered her to an exam table. \u201cRichart talks about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too. This is my son, John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, John.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cRichart,\u201d Dr. Lipton said, \u201cyou and John go wait out in the hallway so your hovering won\u2019t distract me.\u201d She winked at Jenna. \u201cPlus, if Richart isn\u2019t in the room, I can share all kinds of embarrassing stories about him with you.\u201d</p><p>Richart narrowed his eyes in warning, then kissed Jenna. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside if you need us.\u201d</p><p>Jenna smiled and nodded.</p><p>As soon as the door closed behind them, Dr. Lipton shook her head. \u201cThat man is so in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love him, too.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Lipton\u2019s gaze sharpened as she donned a pair of latex gloves. \u201cEnough to transform for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t do that safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s right and you\u2019ve been infected, you may not have a choice. How many times has he bitten you?\u201d There was no mistaking her disapproval.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. He hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cEver?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEver. A vampire bit me once a couple of months ago. He caught me leaving my job and Richart stopped him. But Richart has been there every night since and made sure the vampire didn\u2019t return. I can\u2019t be transformed by just one bite, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless he drained you almost to the point of death, then infused you with his own blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichart said he didn\u2019t do that; so it must be the flu.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Lipton didn\u2019t seem convinced. \u201cLet\u2019s start with your symptoms.\u201d</p><p>Jenna rattled them off and answered questions about severity, onset, and the like as Dr. Lipton took her temperature and engaged in various and assorted poking and prodding.</p><p>She was pretty in a girl-next-door kind of way with brown hair, brown eyes, and a trim figure encased in jeans, a T-shirt, and a lab coat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to level with you, Jenna,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI think Richart\u2019s right. I\u2019ll run a blood test to be sure, but I already know what it\u2019s going to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Jenna broke out in a cold sweat as fear rippled through her. \u201cI\u2019m becoming a vampire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She would suffer progressive brain damage and go insane.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dr. Lipton offered with genuine remorse. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any sugarcoating this. I can\u2019t even give you hope that you might be a gifted one. Nearly all gifted ones have black hair and brown eyes. A few, like me, have brown hair. But never red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a brunette. I dye my hair.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Lipton studied her. \u201cHave you noticed any special gifts or abilities? Know the phone is going to ring before it does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what someone else is feeling? Hear their thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have any special abilities, Dr. Lipton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m screwed, aren\u2019t I, Melanie?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYes. As I said, I\u2019ll run some tests to be sure. See how far the infection has progressed. Take a look at your DNA and see if it bears the extra memo groups that would identify you as a gifted one and protect you from the brain damage. But I\u2019m not very hopeful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d Her mind raced as nightmare images unfolded before her. John having to watch his mother descend into madness. Jenna having to leave to ensure she wouldn\u2019t harm him. Richart watching and waiting for her to reach the point of no return, then taking her life.</p><p>What would it do to him to watch her turn into one of the monsters he hunted? Would she have to leave him, too?</p><p>Richart paced back and forth in front of the door to the infirmary.</p><p>John stood nearby, looking up and down the hallway, taking in the multitude of guards armed with automatic weapons. Half a dozen stood sentinel near two doors a little farther down.</p><p>Dragging his eyes away, John turned to Richart. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there? What are they protecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t protecting what\u2019s in there. They\u2019re protecting everyone out here. Those doors lead to vampires\u2019 apartments.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cVampires live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple do, yes. They surrendered instead of following the example of their brethren and fighting to the death. They\u2019ve been working with Dr. Lipton and the other doctors in hopes of finding a cure for the virus or some treatment that might prevent the brain damage it causes in humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>Richart shook his head and lied. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d They had been searching for a cure for thousands of years with no success.</p><p>John swallowed. \u201cIf Mom becomes a vampire, is she going to go crazy and want to hurt people?\u201d</p><p>Richart nodded, throat too thick to speak.</p><p>Face grim, John resumed his perusal of the hallway. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNetwork headquarters, the hub of the East Coast division of the human network that aids us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are there no windows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re five stories underground.\u201d</p><p>Minutes passed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how Mom could be infected if you didn\u2019t bite her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking on that.\u201d Fulminating over it more like. \u201cIt has to be a member of your study group.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s head whipped around. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be anyone at her job. When bitten, she would\u2019ve blacked out and not made it home. She would\u2019ve woken up on the floor in the store\u2019s back room or her car or somewhere she shouldn\u2019t be and realized she\u2019d lost time, that she couldn\u2019t remember how she had gotten there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t the same be true if one of my study partners had bitten her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he did it while she was sleeping. If he came over on a night I wasn\u2019t there and she went to bed early or napped until I finished hunting, he could\u2019ve asked to use your bathroom, snuck into her bedroom, and fed from her without her ever knowing she had been bitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you had a study session right before she contracted food poisoning? She always bears your study partners\u2019 scents from brushing shoulders with them and the like. The punctures heal swiftly and the effects of the GHB-like chemical she would\u2019ve been exposed to don\u2019t last long, so I wouldn\u2019t have noticed anything amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought it was the fast food the group ordered in. . . . Shit! This is my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the vampire\u2019s fault. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we figure out who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that after your mother is . . . better.\u201d</p><p>After she finished turning. After she became a vampire.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t going to be a better for her\u2014not long-term\u2014and Richart felt a part of himself die at the knowledge.</p><p>The elevator at the end of the hallway pinged. A moment later, the doors slid apart and a blond male about five foot eleven exited. The guards all greeted him with respect as he strolled toward Richart.</p><p>Richart didn\u2019t even try to hide the hostility he felt toward him.</p><p>\u201cI hear we have a visitor,\u201d Chris Reordon said.</p><p>Richart took a menacing step forward. \u201cStay the hell away from her, Reordon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you immortals?\u201d he demanded with a scowl. \u201cYou keep trying to hide your mortal girlfriends from me even though you know I\u2019m just trying to protect you. It\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we all know how ruthless you can be in carrying out your job. I won\u2019t have you strong-arming and intimidating her. And don\u2019t ask Dr. Lipton her name because if you issue a single threat I\u2019ll cast aside concerns about Seth\u2019s wrath and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to ask her name. I already know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenna McBride. Thirty-seven years old. Widowed mother of John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you outed yourself, teleporting to her living room\u2014and I can\u2019t tell you what a brilliant move that was\u2014I tagged you with a tracking device and followed you to her apartment. After that, the rest was easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give her even one moment of unease\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me why it was so easy.\u201d</p><p>Richart frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me why the rest was easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to. Everyone knows you\u2019re good at what you do. It\u2019s why you\u2019re the highest ranking mortal on the East Coast.\u201d</p><p>Chris smiled. \u201cI am good, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Richart grunted.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t even have to try with this one, because we already had Jenna on file. She\u2019s a gifted one.\u201d</p><p>The world went still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe came to our attention during her pregnancy,\u201d Chris went on. \u201cHer boyfriend\u2019s parents insisted on a paternity test to prove John\u2019s father really was his father before the two married. DNA samples were taken from both Jenna and Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hers was different,\u201d Richart murmured. \u201cMore advanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch more advanced. Call-in-the-media-it\u2019s-a-fucking-miracle advanced. Just like yours. We had to run damage control, alter medical records and quite a few memories. We\u2019ve been keeping tabs on her ever since.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t have any special abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t get sick,\u201d John said.</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cExactly. You\u2019re a gifted one, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s eyebrows flew up. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cYou guessed something was wrong with your mother before Richart did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a gifted one in Virginia who is uniquely accurate at diagnosing patients without running any tests. Considering how well you\u2019re doing in school, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ll be the same. You and your mother are probably descended from healers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m doing well in school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, we keep tabs on all gifted ones who come to our attention, often orchestrating things to keep them close in case another incident should arise.\u201d He looked at Richart. \u201cDon\u2019t tell the other immortals that. If they knew just how many gifted ones we\u2019ve guided to this area, they\u2019d try to turn the network into a dating service. And I can\u2019t do my job with that kind of drama surrounding me.\u201d</p><p>Richart\u2019s heart began to pound. Elation flooded him, along with relief so great it practically lifted his feet off the floor. Spinning around, he burst through the door to the infirmary.</p><p>Still seated on the exam table, Jenna jumped.</p> <p>Dr. Lipton smiled. \u201cI heard. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations on what?\u201d Jenna asked, fear and despair battling for dominance in her eyes. Dr. Lipton hadn\u2019t softened her prognosis, and Jenna was clearly doing her damnedest to hold it together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a gifted one.\u201d Richart closed the distance between them and swept her into his arms.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and held him close. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I can\u2019t be. I don\u2019t have any special abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn said you never get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got food poisoning last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t food poisoning. That was the virus beginning to go to work on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart\u201d\u2014Richart leaned back and grinned down at her\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re a gifted one. This is good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see not-getting-sick as an ability. It isn\u2019t something I do. Not willfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re likely descended from healers,\u201d Richart explained. \u201cHealers have remarkable regenerative capabilities. Remember how swiftly my wounds healed after Sheldon transfused me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealers can do that even before their transformation. It\u2019s what enables them to heal others. But the more their DNA has been diluted with ordinary human DNA over the millennia, the weaker their abilities. Were you born a hundred or even fifty years ago, you might have been able to heal with your hands. Instead, your body can fight off any illness to which you\u2019re exposed, save the vampiric virus, and probably recovers from injuries abnormally fast.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cI did recover from childbirth quickly. But . . . you\u2019re sure about this? How do you know I\u2019m not just really healthy? Dr. Lipton hasn\u2019t done any blood tests yet.\u201d</p><p>He told her about the revelations that had arisen from the paternity test years ago.</p><p>Her lips began to tilt up. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to go insane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him and squeezed him tight, then leaned back. \u201cBut I am transforming.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Dr. Lipton.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re transforming,\u201d Dr. Lipton confirmed. \u201cThe fact that your body is reacting the way it is tells me that if we try to halt the transformation, you\u2019ll end up with no viable immune system. Your best option at this point is to let us give you a rapid infusion of infected blood to speed and complete the transformation.\u201d</p><p>Richart willed her to choose the latter. The only alternative was death.</p><p>John, who Richart hadn\u2019t even realized had followed him back into the room, drew in a breath and held it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll transform.\u201d</p><p>John surged forward and hugged Jenna before Richart could embrace her again.</p><p>Richart met Dr. Lipton\u2019s gaze. \u201cCall Roland.\u201d</p><p>Raising one eyebrow, she left the infirmary.</p><p>Jenna stared up at Richart, who smiled as John\u2019s hug went on and on and on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d John murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>Richart shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the vampire\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jenna said, not sure what her son was thinking. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m going to be immortal. That\u2019s not such a bad thing, right?\u201d</p><p>John actually laughed. Straightening, he backed away. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Jenna couldn\u2019t seem to wrap her mind around it. She could potentially live forever. Forever young. Forever strong. Perhaps with Richart?</p><p>How often had he told her that he loved her? Did forever with her sound good to him?</p><p>His smile said it did.</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean Mom is going to be hunting vampires?\u201d John asked.</p><p>Sheesh. She hadn\u2019t even thought of that.</p><p>Richart shifted uneasily. \u201cProbably. The way things have been going lately . . . I would be very surprised if Seth didn\u2019t want you to train and fight alongside the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look happy about that,\u201d she said, unable to imagine it herself.</p><p>\u201cTimes are more dangerous than ever. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt. I\u2019ll speak with Seth and obtain permission to train you myself. Perhaps by the time you\u2019re ready we will have eliminated this latest threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom, the vampire hunter,\u201d John said with a grin. \u201cThat. Is. Awesome!\u201d</p><p>Jenna laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt pays very well, too,\u201d Dr. Lipton said as she returned. \u201cRoland is on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re going to have a fight on your hands, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him why I wanted him to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just said you needed him. He thinks you\u2019ve been injured.\u201d</p><p>Roland, nearly a millennium old, was a powerful healer. And notoriously antisocial when it came to everyone but his wife, Sarah. She alone could coax smiles and laughter from him.</p><p>While they waited for Roland to arrive, Richart and Dr. Lipton explained what Jenna could expect from the rest of her transformation. Constant migraines. Intensifying nausea and vomiting. A dangerously high fever. And \u201cthe worst freaking toothache of your life,\u201d as Dr. Lipton put it. Richart had forgotten that part. His own transformation had taken place so long ago, he had difficulty remembering the details.</p><p>The door slammed open and Roland Warbrook strolled in, Sarah at his side. Both wore the standard hunting garb of immortals and were splattered with blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Roland demanded, scowl in place, his usual dour appearance hampered by the fact that he held Sarah\u2019s hand and tenderly stroked the back of it with his thumb.</p><p>A foot shorter than Roland, Sarah had no difficulty keeping up with his brisk pace and eyed Richart with concern.</p><p>Roland noted Richart\u2019s pristine appearance, took in Jenna, John, and Dr. Lipton, looked again at Jenna, and narrowed his eyes. Drawing in a deep breath, he held it, then glared at Richart. \u201cOh, hell no. You did not summon me here to transform your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, how did you know she\u2019s my girlfriend?\u201d Richart demanded.</p><p>\u201cAlmost every time I\u2019ve seen you in recent weeks, you\u2019ve carried her scent.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Right. \u201cHow did you know I want you to transform her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can smell the virus on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Jenna said, \u201cyou guys really know how to make a girl feel self-conscious.\u201d</p><p>Sarah laughed. \u201cIt takes some getting used to, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Richart shook his head. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I smell the virus on her?\u201d</p><p>Roland shrugged. \u201cHer gift must dampen it. My senses are sharper than yours and I\u2019m a healer, so what may have escaped your notice, wouldn\u2019t escape mine. The point is moot anyway. I\u2019m not going to change her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know my arguments. Younger immortals are always weaker than those who are older. Sarah is far stronger than she should be because you transformed her. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because you\u2019re older or a healer, but if you transform Jenna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my job description.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah stepped forward and offered her hand to Jenna. \u201cWhile they bicker, let me introduce myself. I\u2019m Sarah Bingham.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I meant Sarah Warbrook. I think this is the first time I\u2019ve introduced myself since we married.\u201d</p><p>Jenna grinned. \u201cI remember how weird it was. That\u2019s why I eventually went back to my maiden name. I just never got used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s going to take me a while, too. The big, gorgeous brooding guy is my husband Roland.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice to meet you both. I\u2019m Jenna McBride.\u201d</p><p>Roland turned a speculative gaze on Jenna. \u201cDid you say McBride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally from Virginia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you by any chance related to Brian Tiernan McBride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy paternal grandfather\u2019s name was Brian McBride, but I don\u2019t remember his middle name.\u201d</p><p>Roland studied her a long moment. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Richart gaped. \u201cYou will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s my descendent.\u201d</p><p>Sarah\u2019s eyes widened as she turned to gaze up at him. \u201cSweetie! That\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Richart stared at him. \u201cJenna is related to you?\u201d</p><p>Jenna started to smile, then noticed the no-doubt horrified expression overtaking Richart\u2019s face. \u201cIs that not a good thing?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>All Richart could say was, \u201cChier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Roland donned an evil smile. \u201cMake her happy or I\u2019ll kick your arse.\u201d</p><p>He could do it, too.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Roland turned to Jenna. \u201cAre we going to do this now or what?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed hard. \u201cNow as in right now?\u201d</p><p>Shaking off his dismay, Richart cupped Jenna\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cI know you\u2019re probably nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be right here with you the whole time. Once Roland has infused you with his blood, I\u2019ll take you and John to David\u2019s home. He\u2019s one of our elders and a very powerful healer. More powerful even than Roland, so he can help you through the transformation. Two, three days from now, you\u2019ll be healthier than you\u2019ve ever been. You\u2019ll be stronger. Faster. And you\u2019ll be able to kick my ass if I ever piss you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d John put in.</p><p>Jenna smiled bravely. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Richart lifted her onto the exam table and, cupping a hand behind her neck, gently eased her back.</p><p>Roland approached the other side of the table and took her hand, raising her arm until the bend of her elbow hovered beneath his chin.</p><p>Richart took Jenna\u2019s free hand and held it to his chest.</p><p>Her nervous gaze went to Roland. \u201cI\u2019m not going to want to jump your bones or anything when you bite me, am I?\u201d</p><p>Damned if the taciturn immortal didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cNo. You may want to jump Richart\u2019s though, so, John, beware.\u201d</p><p>John shifted uneasily. \u201cIs this going to get weird? Like kinky weird? Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Richart assured him. \u201cAt most, Jenna will say things she ordinarily wouldn\u2019t say unless she were drunk. You might want to step outside, though, so she won\u2019t feel embarrassed later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He leaned over and kissed Jenna\u2019s cheek. \u201cLove you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI love you, too. Don\u2019t worry, honey. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>As soon as John left, Roland bent his head and sank his fangs into Jenna\u2019s arm.</p><p>Jenna panted as she slumped back against the pillows. \u201cImmortal sex is the best sex ever,\u201d she proclaimed breathlessly.</p><p>Settling beside her, Richart grinned. \u201cLike it, do you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? I could do this all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have been doing it all day. The sun is setting.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the clock with surprise. \u201cIt is?\u201d</p><p>A week had passed since her transformation, which had been pretty miserable. Fortunately, she remembered very little of it beyond Richart\u2019s being there for her through it all.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get ready.\u201d There was no disguising her reluctance. They had spent one week of pure ecstasy together. No work for her since she quit her job. No hunting for Richart, Seth having given him a few days off to help Jenna adapt to the changes. No stress or strife. Just hours spent in bed or out of bed, making love and talking and learning even more about each other than they had already known.</p><p>She hated to see it end, but John had invited his study group over to the apartment tonight and Jenna intended to capture the vampire who had infected her.</p><p>Her stomach gave a nervous flutter.</p><p>She had never physically fought anyone before . . . aside from the night Richart had rescued her from the vampires, but she didn\u2019t remember that.</p><p>Richart seemed confident that, even with no combat training, she could easily subdue the vampire if he did as hoped and snuck into her bedroom to feed from her once more. She wouldn\u2019t have even begun to believe such was possible if she hadn\u2019t grown more bold than she had ever been in bed last night and overpowered Richart, holding him down and . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing,\u201d Richart drawled with amusement. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019ve never been so . . . aggressive before,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d He stole a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? Just thinking about it makes me hard again.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she sat up and faced him. \u201cBut . . . you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m stronger than you now?\u201d He had been right. She didn\u2019t know if it was because Roland was several hundred years older than Richart or because he was a healer, but his transforming her had left her stronger and faster than Richart.</p><p>He sat up beside her and stroked her hair. \u201cNo, I want you to be safe. The stronger and faster you are, the better. Your being able to overpower me would only trouble me if you made me do something I didn\u2019t want to do.\u201d He leaned in close and rubbed noses with her. \u201cAnd everything you did to me, everything you made me do last night, I thoroughly enjoyed.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips to his. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I adore you. Now let\u2019s go kick some vampire ass.\u201d</p><p>The biggest impediment they ran into that night ended up being John.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your anger,\u201d Richart told him for the dozenth time, \u201cbut you must behave as though you know nothing of the vampire\u2019s nefarious deeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t just invite the ones I suspect and kick their asses until one confessed.\u201d</p><p>Richart sighed. John had narrowed it down to two men he thought were the likeliest candidates, but really it could be any of them. \u201cJohn, just do as we\u2019ve asked,\u201d he advised. \u201cBehave as you normally would. No scowls or confrontations. And let your mother and me deal with this.\u201d</p><p>When John opened his mouth to object . . . again . . . Richart held up a hand. \u201cI know your every instinct tells you to protect your mother, but she can pick you up and toss you through that wall over there with very little effort now.\u201d</p><p>John eyed his mother skeptically.</p><p>Jenna raised an eyebrow. \u201cWant a demonstration?\u201d</p><p>He cracked a smile. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She winked.</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing you couldn\u2019t do that back when I was in high school and broke curfew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been seriously tempted.\u201d</p><p>At last, John laughed and relaxed a bit. \u201cOkay. I get it. I\u2019ll stay out of it and let things play out the way you want them to.\u201d</p><p>Richart clapped him on the back. \u201cExcellent.\u201d He motioned to the hallway. \u201cShall we, my love?\u201d</p><p>The study group arrived. Jenna did her mother thing, asking if they liked their new classes, offering snacks and drinks, then said she was heading for bed.</p><p>Good nights trailed down the hallway after her as she entered her bedroom and swung the door until it was almost, but not quite, closed, leaving a little strip of light to illuminate her path to the bed.</p><p>Across the room, a shadow among shadows, Richart winked at her as she drew back the covers, climbed in fully clothed, then tugged them up to her neck. Quiet enfolded them, broken only by the mumbling of chemistry mumbo jumbo in the living room.</p><p>Richart\u2019s heartbeat slowed until even Jenna had difficulty detecting it. But his scent lingered.</p><p>Won\u2019t he smell you? she had asked, thinking it a dead giveaway, but Richart had shaken his head.</p><p>John has mentioned you\u2019re seeing someone. He\u2019ll just assume we slept together earlier and my scent lingers on you.</p><p>Why that had made her flush, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Minutes passed. An hour. Finally someone mentioned using the bathroom and strode up the hallway. A click sounded as light brightened the hallway. The bathroom door closed, darkening it once more.</p><p>Footsteps, light enough to escape mortal detection, approached. The bedroom door swung open and closed so swiftly she almost missed it. A tall form approached the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jenna concentrated on keeping her heartbeat steady, her breath even. Not an easy task. She was nervous as hell.</p><p>The vampire leaned down over the bed. His eyes acquired an emerald glow as he drew closer to her. Through her lashes, she saw his lips part, watched his fangs descend. He reached for the covers and drew them down to bare her throat.</p><p>Jenna struck. Grabbing the vampire by the throat, she cut off the yelp of surprise he tried to emit, tossed him onto his back on the floor, and held him down.</p> <p>Eyes wide, he struggled to peel her fingers away and bucked to try to dislodge her as she shoved her knee in his belly and held him down.</p><p>Holy crap. It really was easy. The strength and power she wielded was as exhilarating as a drug, eradicating her fear.</p><p>Richart stepped up beside her.</p><p>The vamp struggled even harder.</p><p>Smiling darkly, Richart touched Jenna\u2019s shoulder and took them to a clearing not far from his home.</p> <p>Jenna released her captive and rose.</p><p>The vampire scuttled backward like a crab until several yards separated them. Rising, he rubbed his neck and looked around with wild eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just experienced how powerful she is,\u201d Richart warned. \u201cShe\u2019ll catch you if you run.\u201d</p><p>The vampire blurred as he lunged toward the trees.</p><p>Jenna beat him there.</p><p>Skidding to a halt, he darted in another direction.</p> <p>Jenna blocked his way.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he blurted, expression hostile.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be more than twenty years old, stood about five foot nine or so, and had a lean build.</p><p>\u201cThe lady has a question for you,\u201d Richart answered. \u201cI, personally, want to draw and quarter you.\u201d He met Jenna\u2019s gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who got away the night you were attacked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit! I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d</p><p>Richart\u2019s face darkened. His eyes shone like spotlights as his lips peeled back in a snarl of rage, displaying his fangs. \u201cYou infected her!\u201d he roared.</p><p>Jenna\u2019s eyes widened. Richart was pissed!</p><p>\u201cYou knew her from John\u2019s study group and led your vampire friends to her, knowing they would kill her. When that didn\u2019t pan out, you fed from her while she slept! You preyed upon her when she was most vulnerable after she welcomed you into her home!\u201d</p> <p>The vampire backed away. \u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>Jenna stepped forward. \u201cIs that all you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you did to me when you crept into my room and fed from me?\u201d</p><p>Richart took a step toward him. \u201cAnswer the question. Did you touch her while you fed from her? After you fed from her?\u201d</p><p>Jenna had been tormented by the knowledge that he might have.</p><p>\u201cFuck no!\u201d the vamp nearly shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s old enough to be my mother!\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. He made it sound like he was afraid she\u2019d give him the clap or something.</p><p>Richart took another menacing step forward.</p><p>The vampire skittered to the side, farther away from him. \u201cWait. You\u2019re the Immortal Guardian who rescued her!\u201d He drew a knife and settled into a crouch.</p><p>Jenna drew the pair of daggers Richart had given her earlier.</p><p>Richart drew his own. \u201cExpress a little remorse and I\u2019ll consider letting you live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of your brethren have already joined us. You can, too, if you regret harming her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat shit!\u201d Darting to the side, the vampire swept past Richart and attacked Jenna.</p><p>Heart stopping, Jenna raised her daggers and fended off his every blow. The vampire seemed as untrained in battle as she was, swinging wildly with the desperate fury of a child taunted too many times by a bully, but hatred soon stole into his twisted features as a mad glint entered his eyes.</p><p>She deflected his blade with her own. His fist she blocked and countered with her own, fingers still curled around the hilts of her weapons, until . . .</p><p>A miscalculation.</p><p>One of her blades slid across his throat.</p><p>Warm blood slapped her in the face as the vampire stumbled backward, his gray shirt turning crimson.</p><p>Horrified, Jenna took a step toward him.</p><p>He sank to the ground.</p><p>Richart appeared at her side and took her arm to prevent her from continuing forward.</p><p>Sure enough, the vamp swung his blade again and again until he couldn\u2019t anymore.</p><p>Jenna looked up at Richart. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was inevitable,\u201d he said softly. Withdrawing a handkerchief, he wiped her face with care. \u201cYou saw it\u2014the madness that entered his eyes as you fought?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe brain damage was progressing more swiftly in him. Had we let him live, simply feeding from his victims would not have satisfied him much longer. He would have tortured them, killed them, and seen nothing wrong with it just as he saw nothing wrong with preying upon you or allowing his friends to kill you, as they would have had I not intervened.\u201d</p><p>Jenna\u2019s gaze went to the vampire, who stopped breathing and began to shrivel up like a mummy as the virus he housed devoured him from the inside out. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s like? This is what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know it seems brutal, but we save lives, Jenna. You saved lives. And you kept him from becoming a monster. Even good men become fiends once the madness seizes them. Most, when lucid, would much prefer the end you just delivered to harming others.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the daggers, she leaned into him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get used to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie. It\u2019s difficult. But once you see what they do to their victims, it will become a little easier.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands, urging her to look up at him. \u201cAnd I will be with you all the way.\u201d He smoothed his thumbs across her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you always, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>She summoned a smile. \u201cAlways sounds good.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his lips to hers for a slow kiss. \u201cLet\u2019s go show John you\u2019re okay. You can tell the study group the vamp has become ill and is still in the bathroom, then send them home.\u201d</p><p>When she nodded, Richart wrapped his arms around her and the world dissolved.</p><p>HIGH STAKES</p><p>HANNAH JAYNE</p><p>Some people were meant for big cities.</p><p>And fabulousness.</p><p>I\u2019m one of those people.</p><p>I\u2019m Nina LaShay and one day, my brand will be everywhere.</p><p>I stand in front of the mirror every day and say that to my reflection. Well, not so much to my reflection as to the mirrored image of my brand-new, temporary Manhattan digs as I don\u2019t have much of a reflection\u2014or any reflection at all.</p><p>Being undead will do that to you.</p><p>Call me what you want\u2014vampire. Bloodless one. Nightwalker; lost one; soulless, Godless aboveground hell dweller. Personally, I\u2019m partial to Life-Backward, Fashion-Forward Temple of Awesome. How else do you explain a twenty-one-year-old (give or take 141 years) woman being one of the last three standing in the greatest fashion competition the couture world has ever seen?</p><p>I was steaming my latest Drop Dead creation\u2014that\u2019s the name of my fashion line\u2014Drop Dead Clothing (I know, totes adorbs, right?), when the faint scent of two-day-old patchouli oil and sweat snaked into my apartment. The whole super-vamp sense of smell? Makes pastries smell a thousand times more amazing. It also makes the modern street hippie \u201cat one with the Earth\u201d smell like a three-day bus ride through Calcutta in June. I wrinkled my nose and did my best to breathe through my mouth before I snatched open the multi-bolted door and grimaced\u2014then snarled\u2014when I saw where the pungent scent was coming from.</p><p>It was her.</p><p>Emerson Hawk.</p><p>With her beady brown eyes, gaunt cheeks, and head of Supercuts-styled straw-colored locks, she looked far more drowned pigeon than hawk, but what can you do?</p><p>She gasped when she saw me, her anemic lips dropping open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my competition?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to say something scathing and smart but decided to err on the side of breather-approved sportsmanlike conduct. \u201cAnd I suppose that means that you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Emerson cocked her head and swooshed her ugly hair over one shoulder. \u201cI was being facetious, sweetie. You and your welcome-to-the-dark-side designs are no kind of competition at all.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself bristle and although Emerson is shamefully, one-hundred-percent flesh-and-blood human being (\u201cbreathers\u201d as they\u2019re known on the undead end), I desperately wanted to stake her through her patchouli-scented heart.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I said, crossing my arms in front of my chest. \u201cDrop Dead has spanked\u2014what is it? Tweet by Emerson Hawk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoar,\u201d she corrected with a snarl. \u201cSoar by Emerson Hawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Either way, Drop Dead has spanked your line often and repeatedly.\u201d I smiled sweetly, my lips pressed together\u2014not so much in an effort to hide my always-there pointed petite incisors, but more in an effort to keep my fangs from digging into her obnoxious sallow flesh.</p><p>But I bet she\u2019d taste like stale bread.</p><p>Emerson waved at the air like I was some gnat at her ear. \u201cSmall-town shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSan Francisco Fashion Week is not small-town shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerson?\u201d A head popped out from the door behind Emerson, and Emerson bristled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Nicolette?\u201d she asked from between gritted teeth.</p> <p>Nicolette blushed a fierce red and glanced quickly at me and then directly to the stained carpet at her feet. But in that fleeting glance, I noticed that Nicolette shared Emerson\u2019s unfortunately beady eyes and sharp, defined cheekbones, though she had clearly gotten the luxe end of the stick when it came to hair. Hers was cut in a cheeky bob and glistened a pretty blond. \u201cI have all the garments steamed if you want to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said casually, \u201cwho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister,\u201d Emerson snapped. \u201cAnd Nicolette, even you can\u2019t mess up steam. There are a few more things in the bathroom, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSisters?\u201d I said. \u201cHow very Little House on the Prairie.\u201d</p><p>Even with her face turned toward the floor, I could see Nicolette\u2019s cheeks push up into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m Nina, by the way.\u201d I pushed out a hand and Nicolette shook; the female equivalent of crossing enemy lines. I could practically see the steam shooting from Emerson\u2019s ears and it gave me a happy.</p> <p>\u201cYour sister was telling me all about her cute little fashion line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute? Apparently you forgot who spanked who in Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s whom. Who spanked whom. And of course I didn\u2019t forget. I generally find it hard to forget when someone steals my designs,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSteals? I prefer to call it \u2018borrowed inspiration.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to call it a death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Nicolette said, her voice soft as she addressed the floor. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a third person in the competition?\u201d</p> <p>Emerson rested her fists on her love handles and threw back her head, looking like a stupid statue of some sort of conqueror. \u201cThere is a third person, but he\u2019s hardly part of the competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d I hated being caught unawares, but I hadn\u2019t read my welcome packet (hello? I\u2019m in New York. Is someone seriously expecting me to read?) and didn\u2019t know who was behind door number three.</p><p>Emerson jerked a thumb in the vague direction of the hallway. \u201cReg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReginald Fairfield?\u201d I gaped.</p><p>Reginald Fairfield was the Queen Elizabeth of the up-and-coming fashion world: regal, benign, and basically a figurehead who kept plaid walking shorts and seersucker fabrics alive and kicking. Every one of his lines was crisp and came in shades of Martha\u2019s-Vineyard-slash-old money, and the rumor around town was the man himself had never actually wielded a pair of scissors\u2014he left the dirty work to his \u201ctraveling companion,\u201d an exceptionally well-tanned young gentleman with a heavy accent and a resum\u00e9 that I am completely sure contained the words \u201ccabana boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey moved in about a week early.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI suppose it would take some time for Reginald to unpack his marble busts and Felipe\u2019s Speedos.\u201d</p><p>Nicolette sniggered behind her hand and Emerson went from remotely tolerable back to grade-A horrible. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have some fabric to steam?\u201d</p> <p>Nicolette scampered away like a sad little pup and Emerson turned her eyes\u2014and her stench\u2014back to me.</p><p>\u201cLook LaShay, you and I both know that this competition boils down to only two people: you and me.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips. \u201cSo you admit I\u2019m competition.\u201d</p><p>Emerson just rolled her eyes and continued. \u201cYour designs may have impressed a few lesser judges and\u201d\u2014she made air quotes\u2014\u201cspanked mine, but this time, make no mistake. I. Will. Bury. You.\u201d</p><p>I cocked an eyebrow, not the least bit bothered by Emerson\u2019s attempt at threatening me. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean your designs will bury mine?\u201d</p><p>She smiled this time, poking the edge of her tongue out to moisten her bottom lip as she shrugged. \u201cSemantics.\u201d</p><p>I stood in the hallway, staring, as she slammed the door.</p><p>It was the next morning and being a vampire with no need of sleep, I spent the midnight hours checking out the town, frowning at the all beautiful clothes locked behind plate glass and CLOSED signs, and ultimately decimating two more blood bags than I needed to while watching Susan Lucci hock obscene-looking Pilates equipment and god-awful jewelry. When the sun finally began to peek through my drawn blinds, I gathered up my wares\u2014rolls of gorgeous, plush fabric that was hand-sewn decades before the word vintage was coined (one of the huge benefits of having a shopping habit that spanned centuries rather than seasons), spun gold thread, bugle beads, and my absolute favorite, number-one must have: a good pair of scissors. I rolled the pair I had across my palm, enjoying their heft, the Swarovski-crusted handle, the ultrasharp blades, and the swirled-letter engraving there: Not friend, sister. Love always, Sophie.</p><p>It gave me a little pang when I ran my fingers over the words. Sophie Lawson is my San Francisco roommate and though so fashion-challenged it\u2019s terminal, she means the world to me. In my afterlife I tried hard to never let anything get to me, never let anything attach, but Sophie did both of those things. Besides, her constant bad body luck (the dead were constantly dropping out of the woodwork when she was around) kept me really entertained.</p><p>Good entertainment means a lot when you\u2019ve been around for every movie from The Horse in Motion to Spiderman (all iterations).</p><p>My hand was hovering over the phone when I heard the thunk-thunk-thunk of someone beating the walls in the hallway, then a low, enraged voice echoing through the hundred-year-old architecture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m know you\u2019re in there! Get out here!\u201d</p><p>I poked my head out into the hallway and groaned when I saw that the burly, angry voice was coming from Emerson, and the thunk-thunk-thunking from her clodhopper shoe as she kicked my next-door neighbor\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your problem, Emerson? You\u2019re going to wake up the entire borough!\u201d</p><p>Emerson turned to me, nostrils flaring, eyes spitting fire. \u201cIt\u2019s Reginald Fairfield. I know he\u2019s in there,\u201d she said, turning her back to the still-closed door. \u201cI know you\u2019re in there!\u201d She gave the door another wallop\u2014this time with her fisted hand\u2014then a few more swift kicks before I grabbed her around the waist, yanking her back.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you beating on his door like a maniac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA maniac? A maniac?\u201d She wriggled out of my bear hold. \u201cYou were probably in on it! You probably let him into my apartment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReginald stole my fabric. The whole bolt! All of it!\u201d She was flailing but hitting nothing, and sweat beaded on her upper lip and at her hairline, matting down her blunt-cut bangs. \u201cHe\u2019s a cheat! And now he\u2019s hiding out. He won\u2019t even open the door, the coward.\u201d She launched herself at the door. \u201cYou\u2019re a coward, Reginald!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDios mio! Ladies, ladies, what is going on here?\u201d</p><p>We both blinked at Felipe, Reginald\u2019s paramour, as he stood in the hallway, tanned legs exposed in his plaid walking shorts, muscles flexed as he carried two stuffed grocery bags against his chest.</p><p>A new rage roiled through Emerson\u2019s body, the heat coming off her in waves. I held my nose and wrapped an arm around her before she lunged at Felipe.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Felipe,\u201d I said, doing my best to secure Emerson but avoid her stink. \u201cEmerson is under the impression that Reginald stole some fabric from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an impression!\u201d Emerson screeched.</p><p>Felipe just shook his head and clucked his tongue, unaffected. \u201cMy Reginald would do nothing of the sort,\u201d he said in his heavily accented English. \u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, his dark eyes taking in Emerson and her cardboard-colored dress, \u201cReggie would not use your fabrics. They are so . . .\u201d He let the word trail off, the disgust on his face finishing his sentence.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t steal it to use it, he stole it to fuck me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that Reginald was the one who stole your fabric?\u201d I asked Emerson.</p><p>She gritted her teeth and spat through them. \u201cHe came over last night. Both of them did. We had a glass of wine, and Reginald was touching the fabric, admiring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just trying to be nice,\u201d Felipe clarified, shifting his shopping bags.</p><p>\u201cI got sleepy. They must have drugged me. I fell asleep\u2014probably didn\u2019t even lock the door after they left. And when I woke up\u2014gone! The whole bolt. And now the damn coward won\u2019t even open up the door and confront me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPshhh!\u201d Felipe let out a dismissing puff of air. \u201cReggie is just a hard sleeper.\u201d He handed me a bag and plugged his key into the lock. \u201cReggie,\u201d he sang as we trailed behind.</p><p>I heard the bag clatter to the hardwood floor first, a jar of marinated mushrooms shattering, the oil oozing toward my shoes. Then I heard Felipe, heard the air squeeze out of his lungs. I didn\u2019t have to see his face to know that it was twisted in horror, and as pearl white as mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh!

Reginald.</p><p>A loop of fabric was wrapped around his neck, pinching tight as he hung from the rafter. His head lolled forward as if he had just fallen asleep. But his eyes were open, bulging. They were already clouded and dull. His skin was mottled purple and he swayed an inch this way, an inch that way, his shoes scraping across the glossy finish of the cherry-wood table underneath him. Each time his body moved, the rafter he was tied to groaned. The scrape of his feet and the groan of the rafter seemed like the only sounds in the entire world and I remembered, far before I was turned, my father sitting with me as a child while I held my grandmother\u2019s hand. She lay in bed, wilted, her body ravaged by sickness.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone now,\u201d my father said as his hand glided over her eyes.</p><p>I squeezed my grandmother\u2019s hand, unwilling to believe, even as sadness locked in my throat. \u201cBut how do you know?\u201d</p><p>There had been no change in my grandmother from this moment to the last. Not a final word, a sigh\u2014not even a flicker of her soul as it passed through her body.</p><p>\u201cThe silence,\u201d my father said simply, standing. \u201cIt\u2019s dead silence.\u201d</p><p>That was what surrounded us now in Reginald\u2019s apartment\u2014dead silence, punctuated only by the scrape and groan.</p> <p>And then the living came through.</p><p>\u201cOh, Reggie!\u201d Felipe slapped his hands to his cheeks and started to scream\u2014a high-pitched, painful wail, tears welling and rolling over his manicured fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my fabric!\u201d Emerson\u2019s voice was a shrill knife cutting through Felipe\u2019s anguish and my own astonishment as I tried to tear my eyes from Reginald. Emerson shoved me aside, pointing to the ragged-edge loops around Reginald\u2019s neck. \u201cThat\u2019s why he stole my bolt?\u201d</p><p>It actually was god-awful fabric, even for a suicide.</p><p>Felipe heaved and began clawing at the table, his clawed hands going for Reginald\u2019s pant legs as I tried to hold him back.</p> <p>\u201cEmerson,\u201d I snapped, \u201cforget about the fabric and call nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>I held on to Felipe and he crushed against me, finally giving up, crying silently. I could feel his warmth, the thud of his heart\u2014and I couldn\u2019t look at Reginald anymore. He wasn\u2019t just a dead breather. He had been loved.</p><p>Emerson was on her cell phone; I could hear her voice, calm and rigid as she talked to the nine-one-one operator.</p><p>\u201cSuicide . . . hanging . . . already dead.\u201d She was shielding the phone with her hand, her back toward the body. She looked over her shoulder once or twice and mumbled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get him down!\u201d Felipe sobbed, tearing away from me. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him there, hanging like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, grabbing a handful of his shirt, yanking him backward. \u201cWe have to leave him, Felipe. The police will handle this.\u201d Back in San Francisco, I had tried to pull my roommate away from enough CSI marathons to be pretty familiar with police procedurals.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to call the police? But why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re already on their way,\u201d Emerson said, waggling her cell phone as if that explained it all.</p> <p>\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d</p><p>It could have been the slow motion of the whole situation but the two-word sentence sounded like a full monologue. My head snapped to where the deep voice was coming from. It was my direct intent to rip his throat out for interrupting this horrific moment, but when I saw him, the death scene in front of me faded into oblivion and my entire body went rigid, colder than normal, and on complete and utter I-want-to-eat-him-in-a-nonvampiric-way high alert.</p><p>He was handsome in that traffic-stopping kind of way, with brown-black hair that was just slightly shaggy and unkempt. The wave of his bangs licked over his eyebrows and framed chocolate-brown eyes that I would happily drown in. His skin was the most delicious shade of non-New York, non-vampire toasty brown, and, I happily noticed, he had the kind of body that made one think of Greek gods or jungle men in loincloths. He had a tribal tattoo running down the length of his well-muscled arm and though I had never been interested in them before, I was suddenly, wholeheartedly pro-ink.</p><p>Even from this distance, I could smell the salty, toasted coconut scent that wafted from his skin.</p><p>I was actually salivating.</p><p>Though it almost physically hurt to tear my eyes from him I did\u2014just for a millisecond\u2014to glance at Emerson. She had gone from open-mouthed stare to stone still, feet akimbo, hands on hips. Her eyes were hard, narrow slits spitting dagger glares toward the man I intended to spend the rest of my afterlife with.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, Pike?\u201d she spat.</p><p>Pike, Pike! She knew his name! Images of harp-strumming cherubs and Vera Wang floated in my mind while his name pinged around my head like the heavenly music it was. Pi-i-i-i-i-i-k-e . . .</p><p>And then it stopped.</p><p>How did Emerson Hawk, of utter stink and stolen designs know my new beau, Pike? Which is actually kind of a stupid name (unless you\u2019re a fish, natch) but still, it should never have been able to come out of Emerson\u2019s halitosis-filled mouth.</p><p>Pike held up an expensive looking camera. \u201cPhoto essay for the contest. But . . .\u201d</p><p>Emerson pointed. \u201cReginald Fairfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to shoot the three finalists.\u201d</p><p>Emerson cocked out a hip, still pointing. \u201cMeet finalist number three. A photo shoot is not going to happen.\u201d Her voice was remarkably unaffected and I cringed. Maybe I wasn\u2019t the only one without a soul.</p><p>\u201cIs something going to be done about\u2014\u201d</p><p>But his deep voice was cut off by the wail of sirens and the marching band-like clatter of police officers as they thundered into the building. They spread out, corralling us as crime scene techs surrounded the body and studied the scene.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need to clear the premises.\u201d The police officer didn\u2019t look at us as he said it, but no one dared challenge him. \u201cBut don\u2019t go far. We need to take statements.\u201d</p><p>Emerson, Felipe, Pike, and I stumbled out into the hallway, keeping our distance from the flurry of activity flowing in and out of Reginald\u2019s apartment. Felipe was quiet, nose a heady red, cheeks chapped from the constant flow of tears. I patted his shoulder awkwardly. He sniffled and shook like a wet Chihuahua.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, man,\u201d Pike said slowly.</p><p>Felipe continued to stare straight ahead, teeth chattering, but otherwise catatonic.</p><p>I heard Pike suck in a sharp breath and jam his hands in his pockets. As a dead man was hanging not thirty feet away, I shouldn\u2019t have noticed the way that motion\u2014hands in pockets\u2014pulled Pike\u2019s jeans just a little tighter over his ass, exposing his perfect, peach-shaped bottom, but I did.</p><p>I remembered the sweet, juicy taste of peaches and licked my lips, savoring the memory on my tongue.</p><p>Then Pike turned those mesmerizing cozy brown eyes of his on me. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met yet. You must be Nina, right? I\u2019m Pike.\u201d He held a hand out\u2014a big, wonderful hand that made me think of the old adage about big hands and feet\u2014and I slipped my hand into his feeling dainty and demure\u2014which was refreshing when I\u2019m most often referred to as any variant of \u201csoulless bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my long, black hair over one shoulder and pulled back my shoulders\u2014or stuck out my breasts, depending on how you looked at it\u2014and pasted on my most beguiling smile. I may be a little short in the soul/life department, but when it came to flirting, I was a star student and Pike warmed to my gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Nina LaShay. And this,\u201d I said, touching Felipe lightly on the shoulder. \u201cThis is Felipe. He is\u2014was . . .\u201d I choked on the word and Felipe\u2019s eyes went round and heart-breakingly big. \u201cHe was with Reginald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDios mio!\u201d Felipe started again, huffing and tearing at his hair. \u201cMi osito de peluche es muerte! Muerte!\u201d</p><p>One of the paramedics came toward us and snaked an arm around Felipe, talking in a low, soothing voice and leading him away.</p><p>Pike shook his head. \u201cPoor guy.\u201d</p><p>There was an uncomfortable pause and I briefly thought of Googling \u201cHow to flirt at a murder scene.\u201d I decided to go with the tried and true.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re\u2014Pike?\u201d I could feel my eyebrows scrunching together unattractively and Pike offered a small smile, his eyes completely transfixed on mine. It was like we were speaking our own incredibly sexy language.</p><p>I had every intention of making that language clothing optional.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s short for Paikea.\u201d</p><p>Well sure, that was better.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Maori, but I\u2019m actually Hawaiian.\u201d</p><p>I was thinking of my Pike, greased up in suntan oil and smelling like coconuts.</p><p>\u201cYou have quite a strong grip, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I snatched my hand back, embarrassed, wishing for once that I had an ounce of blood to wash a cute crimson blush across my cheeks. Instead I just smiled demurely, glancing at my soulmate through lowered lashes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou could probably get out of here, Pike. There\u2019s not going to be any photo shoot. At least I\u2019m not doing one.\u201d Emerson turned on her heel and disappeared into her apartment, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cAh, Emerson,\u201d Pike said. \u201cA regular breath of vile air.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the wall, looking very Diesel-commercial chic. His eyes went over my head, scanning the activity in Reginald\u2019s apartment, and I took a quick moment to revel, taking in every inch of this man who should have been a calendar model.</p> <p>For every month of the year.</p><p>I swallowed back the inappropriate desire to engage him in some sultry dirty talk and instead leaned against the wall across from him. I was about to open my mouth, was working up the perfect post-suicide sentence when Pike hitched his shoulder at me and silently walked away.</p><p>I fought the urge to growl and then the urge to crawl under my bed and hide. I wasn\u2019t used to people walking away from me\u2014especially not male people. I was working up a reason to follow Pike when Emerson stopped behind me, close enough that her patchouli scent wafted off her and stuck to me. I grimaced, then immediately pasted on an appropriately demure smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is awful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She actually shrugged. \u201cHate to speak ill of the dead, but the coward was obviously too scared to show his face after he stole my fabric.\u201d</p> <p>My voice was a hissing whisper. \u201cAre you kidding me? A man is dead, and you\u2019re still focused on your fabric? God, even Pike,\u201d I said, jutting my chin toward him, desperate to feel his name on my tongue again. \u201cA complete stranger feels more for Reginald than you do.\u201d</p><p>Emerson shook her head, that gnat-in-her-ear expression on her face. \u201cPike is no stranger.\u201d She waved her hand in his general direction. \u201cHe\u2019s an ex.\u201d</p><p>I hoped to God that Emerson meant an ex to Reginald or Felipe because even finding out that the love of my life was gay was preferable to finding out that he may have once been attracted to someone like Emerson. \u201cHe hangs around a lot. Kind of can\u2019t get the message.\u201d</p><p>I felt my mouth drop wide open. By the pleased purse on Emerson\u2019s lips, I could tell that she knew she\u2019d hit a nerve. She looked about to say something smart but was silenced by an officer carrying a Ziploc bag stuffed with hideous fabric.</p><p>Emerson made a tiny puppy sound, then shoved me out of the way. \u201cWhere are you taking that? That is my fabric!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI told you he stole it.\u201d She snatched the whole bag out of the officer\u2019s gloved hand and gaped. \u201cIt\u2019s ruined!\u201d</p><p>The officer snatched the bag back. \u201cIt\u2019s evidence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvidence?\u201d Emerson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s mine. I need it for the competition!\u201d</p><p>Pike came over to us, getting in front of Emerson and letting the cop scurry away. \u201cReginald used that fabric to hang himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cDid he use it all? Do I have enough for my garment?\u201d</p><p>I swung my head toward Emerson, astonished. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about? Your stupid fabric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a competition, Nina, or have you forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the scene of a suicide!\u201d Part of me wanted to give Emerson\u2019s neck a little slash just to see what kind of demon she was. But I could hear her breath, hear the blood pumping from her heart and pulsing through her human veins. My stomach turned in on itself knowing that someone still in possession of her soul could be so callous. \u201cA man is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ask someone about the extra fabric?\u201d she asked Pike.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just a photographer, but I can ask one of the cops. . . .\u201d he said, though clearly uncomfortable as he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you, Emerson. I knew you were a snake but I didn\u2019t peg you for completely heartless. Reginald is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for that,\u201d she said unconvincingly. \u201cBut he was still a competitor.\u201d</p><p>I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head and for once, I couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say. That seemed to be just fine to Emerson, who shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there were two,\u201d she said before walking back toward her apartment.</p><p>I was shaking my head, still shocked, when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and blinked into the slate-gray eyes of yet another police officer. This one was short and stocky, with tree-trunk legs and a little leather notebook clutched in his baseball-mitt hands. He used the tip of his Bic to scratch at his receding hairline. \u201cAre you the one who discovered the body?\u201d</p><p>For some reason, my voice was stuck in my throat so I nodded, dumbly.</p><p>\u201cI just need to take a quick statement. Your name and address, please.\u201d</p><p>I must have recited everything properly because the cop seemed satisfied. He looked up from his notebook, eyes laser-focused on mine. \u201cWhat was the state of the body when you first entered the premises?\u201d</p><p>I was trying to think of a kind way to say \u201changed,\u201d but nothing seemed to soften the blow. \u201cIt was, uh, deceased. Hanging. No one touched it, though.\u201d</p><p>The officer, whose name badge read Hopkins, raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe body,\u201d I said. \u201cReginald. We went in with Felipe and saw him . . . there. Like that. Then . . .\u201d I waved my hand, gesturing to the chaos.</p><p>\u201cSo, you were with the others when Felipe opened the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was barely a whisper.</p><p>Hopkins wrote something in his little notebook and I wondered briefly why cops always seemed to repeat your answers back to you. \u201cAnd the others were Felipe, Emerson, Pike, and uh, Nicolette?\u201d</p><p>I suddenly drew a huge blank. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, nodding. \u201cI mean, yes.\u201d</p><p>Look\u2014we have an impeccable sense of smell, super speed, and no discernible weight. Memory? Strictly breather-class. It\u2019s not good.</p><p>Hopkins cut his eyes to me, then to Felipe, who hung back in the hallway, and back to me. He chewed his bottom lip and narrowed his eyes, \u00e0 la every incompetent cop I\u2019d ever seen on TV. \u201cWhat was your relationship with Mr. Fairfield?\u201d</p><p>I swung my head. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much of one. We were colleagues. In the fashion industry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t know anything about Mr. Fairfield\u2019s emotional state.\u201d</p><p>I think it is perfectly obvious that Reginald Fairfield wasn\u2019t of sound mind. No one in Easter-colored seersucker could be. But I pegged Hopkins for more of a by-the-book kind of cop rather than a down-the-runway one. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins sucked in a long breath, then tucked his pen in his chest pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s likely we\u2019ll have some more questions for you later, okay? You\u2019ll want to stay around.\u201d He turned and disappeared into Reginald\u2019s apartment once more, and Felipe rushed toward me, a bottle of water quaking in his hands. He was no longer crying, but his body already looked ravaged from his grief. His shoulders were hunched and his eyes looked hollow and sunk into the redness around them.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re not supposed to leave, why don\u2019t you come inside, Felipe? I\u2019m just down the hall.\u201d I looked over Felipe\u2019s shoulder and eyed Pike. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come inside as well, Pike.\u201d I liked the way his name sounded on my tongue and yes, I did admonish myself for thinking of Pike in my mouth while a team of police officers were cutting a dead man down next door.</p><p>I\u2019m only vampire; so sue me.</p><p>I led Felipe into the apartment, Pike behind us. Felipe took a small sip from the water bottle and must have rehydrated. He immediately started crying again, full, body-wracking sobs while he wrung his hands and mumbled, his accent becoming thicker and more pronounced with each word. I might be without a soul but I wasn\u2019t without a heart and mine ached for him. I filled a glass of water and pushed it into Felipe\u2019s hands, then slung my arm over his shoulder and led him to the couch. He shivered under my touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re freezing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCirculation problem,\u201d I said automatically.</p><p>Pike took a seat on the couch and scooted over, giving Felipe room to sit. I caught Pike\u2019s hot chocolate gaze for a second and I was immediately warmed by the sweet concern in his eyes, and taken by the way his lips still looked full and tasty even when the corners turned down in a slight frown. He nodded to Felipe who crushed himself into the couch and heaved an enormous, hiccupping breath.</p><p>Through the open apartment door I could see the coroner and his assistant pushing through the crowd, could hear the squeaking wheels of the gurney as they laid Reginald out and wheeled him away. Thankfully, the din of chatter, police radios, and general city noises must have drowned out the dead sounds for Felipe because he sucked down his bottle of water and blinked repeatedly, the tears actually seeming to dry.</p><p>Officer Hopkins ambled down the hall and knocked on Emerson\u2019s door. I watched as Nicolette pulled it open, her face a yellow-hued shade of pale, her eyes small and circled by exhausted purple bags. They darted past Hopkins and took in the scene in the hall, skidded over the coroner as he pushed Reginald away. There was a slight terror in her eyes and I could see the pale edges of her lips pulled down as she murmured to Officer Hopkins. When Nicolette disappeared and Emerson took her spot, I took a step forward, my head cocked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour relationship to Mr. Fairfield, miss?\u201d</p><p>Emerson blinked quickly and even from across the hall\u2014and by way of my super-vamp sense\u2014I could hear her heartbeat speed up, could hear the sharpness of the shallow breath she sucked in. I crossed my arms in front of my chest, watching, as Emerson licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cHe was a designer like myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you all three live here in this complex? Is it, like, some sort of shared housing or artist co-op or something?\u201d</p><p>I watched Emerson\u2019s head swing from side to side, her straw hair brushing her shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019re the three finalists in a design competition.\u201d She bit her bottom lip, her eyes flashing and catching mine. \u201cWell, we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re competitors?\u201d Hopkins tapped the end of his pen against Emerson\u2019s doorframe, the rhythmic tap like a heartbeat. \u201cWas there a lot of stress at this competition? Was Mr. Fairfield not doing well?\u201d</p><p>Emerson straightened up, her hands going to the doorframe and gripping. I caught the smallest scent of sweat on the air.</p><p>Emerson was nervous.</p> <p>\u201cThe competition hadn\u2019t really started yet. I don\u2019t see why Reginald would have been\u2014would have thought he wasn\u2019t doing well. Maybe Felipe knows more.\u201d Emerson\u2019s eyes crested over Hopkins\u2019s head and she looked at me. \u201cOr maybe Nina knows something.\u201d She glanced at her non-ironic Swatch watch and shifted her weight. \u201cAre we through now? I\u2019ve got to work on my designs.\u201d</p><p>Emerson left Hopkins standing in the doorway. He turned on his heel and we were eye to eye\u2014me, standing in my apartment, door flung wide open, spying, and him, narrow-eyed, chewing on the end of his pen. He beckoned for me to come into the hallway.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss LaShay,\u201d he said, shifting his weight in what I was guessing he thought was some sort of imposing manner. \u201cIs there a reason you didn\u2019t mention that you and Mr. Fairfield were direct competitors in this competition?\u201d</p><p>I snaked my arms in front of my chest and mirrored Officer Hopkins\u2019s narrow-eyed glare. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was necessary information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have given someone the motive to harm Fairfield, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would think, had he not hung himself.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins shot me a slow, appraising gaze. \u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t leave the county, all right? I might have some additional questions for you.\u201d</p><p>Something about the way Hopkins kept his watery eyes fixed on me gave me a slight chill. I had every intention of escorting him right out of my apartment until he checked his smartphone, scanned the room, and asked, \u201cFelipe DeLaCruz?\u201d</p><p>Felipe turned and raised a small hand. \u201cI am Felipe.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins paused then, his flat-balloon face breaking into what passed as a smile. \u201cPike! Didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins and Pike did that awkward, manly handshake-to-semi-hug kind of thing and I felt my mouth drop open. I made a beeline for them.</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d I hissed.</p><p>\u201cPike does some photography work for us on occasion.\u201d Hopkins raised his eyebrows toward Pike. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I was hired by the magazine to shoot the designers.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins\u2019s eyes showed a flash of interest. \u201cSo you knew the dec\u2014\u201d</p><p>I shot a glance over my shoulder and nudged Hopkins and Pike out of the living room, out of Felipe\u2019s direct line of sight.</p><p>\u201cCan you not throw around words like deceased and decedent in front of Felipe? That man just lost the man he loved. Can\u2019t you be a little more sensitive?\u201d</p><p>The sentence bobbed around in my head and my spine stiffened. My breather roommate was constantly telling me to \u201cbe a little more sensitive.\u201d She was usually the one inundated with dead bodies and detectives.</p><p>Guess things were starting to rub off.</p><p>Hopkins blew out a long sigh and I made a mental note to drop an inhaler off at the police station\u2014the man obviously had breathing issues. Either that or someone along the line told him that sharp breaths were the way to throw a suspect off. I would have laughed, had I not had the sneaking suspicion that I was going to be one of his \u201csuspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. DeLaCruz?\u201d Hopkins said, edging his way back toward the living room.</p><p>I fixed him with a stare, not entirely sure what I was trying to convey. I was angry, suspicious, sad for Felipe\u2019s loss\u2014and, strangely, a little scared.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Hopkins, huh?\u201d</p><p>Pike broke out into a smile that looked wildly inappropriate amongst the background of crumpled tissues and crime scene techs, but it shot a bolt of fire through me just the same.</p><p>\u201cMe and Hopkins? It\u2019s not like we were dating or anything. I just bump into him on occasion.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pike said as he followed me into the kitchen, inclining his head, eyes jutting to Felipe and the officer. \u201cWhat do you think that\u2019s all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably just routine,\u201d I said, suddenly feeling the need to put space between us. \u201cCan I get you something to eat?\u201d I asked him, wishing to God he\u2019d say no since the entirety of my refrigerator\u2019s contents were six O negative blood bags and sixteen varying shades of OPI nail polish.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m cool. So what did Hopkins want with you?\u201d</p><p>I spun, my body suddenly colder than normal. \u201cHe wanted to know what he should buy you for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>Pike scrunched his brow and I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHopkins didn\u2019t want anything with me.\u201d</p><p>Pike gestured toward the hall. \u201cYou guys were talking for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>I pinched my bottom lip, scanning Pike from tip to tail. He was gorgeous, there was no doubt about that. But, could I trust him?</p><p>The last time I trusted a good-looking man, he sucked away my blood and my soul. I had learned my lesson.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing. He just had some basic questions.\u201d I shrugged, still feeling uneasy.</p><p>I peered over Pike\u2019s shoulder to see Felipe on the couch, head in his hands, index fingers pressed against his temples. Hopkins sat across from him, that stupid pen poised over his little leather notepad.</p><p>\u201cNo one would want to hurt my Reggie,\u201d Felipe moaned. \u201cHe was such a gentle soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is Hopkins treating Reginald\u2019s suicide like it was a murder?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Pike shrugged, his gaze following mine. \u201cMaybe there is more to it than we saw.\u201d</p><p>By the time Hopkins had grilled us all and the crime scene and cop brigade had left the building, my body was humming. I could still smell Pike in my apartment, his coconut scent just hanging in the air. But there was something else, too\u2014and having spent enough time with it I couldn\u2019t deny it: the stench of death was heavy in the air.</p><p>I leaned against my window, watching the taxicabs honking and tourists walking on the street below, watching people going about their everyday lives in the twilight. They moved in sort of an organized chaos, completely unaware that just a few hundred feet away a life had ended and another had changed completely.</p><p>I remembered the last breath of life as it seeped out of me. My body fought to hold tight to it and I felt like my insides were burning. But the handsome stranger\u2014his arms\u2014were tight around me and somehow I still felt safe, willing the life to drip out of me as I licked the droplets of blood on his neck. I needed them. The thirst was overwhelming. I was changing; I was becoming someone\u2014something\u2014else, and all around me life went on. My parents sat in the parlor; my siblings, fast asleep in their beds. And I was outside, dying, living, changing, becoming.</p><p>An immense sadness washed over me.</p><p>I flopped onto my couch and pressed my fingertips to my temples. I didn\u2019t have a headache\u2014it\u2019s physiologically impossible for a vampire to have a headache\u2014but I could almost swear it was on its way.</p><p>That\u2019s why I jumped a foot and a half when the goddamn black bird that had taken up residence outside my front window started squawking like the disease-infested winged rodent that it was. I rolled last week\u2019s copy of US Weekly into a narrow tube, flattened myself against the wall, then slammed the magazine against the glass, willing the stupid bird to exit once and for all. I didn\u2019t have the nerve to look.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid of birds. Hello? I\u2019m a vampire. I\u2019m afraid of nothing! Except maybe sunlight, shoulder pads, and the very real idea that neon and side ponytails are coming back into fashion. But birds? No. They just disgust me. With their beady eyes and their mean, pointy beaks, and those wings. Disease is carried on those wings, I just know it. So the fact that this, this\u2014monster\u2014had the gall to pace my windowsill on a very regular basis, squawking and clawing and generally just making a nuisance of itself, bothered me to no end.</p><p>Seriously, I was considering renting a cat.</p><p>When a good minute\u2014a silent, non\u2013wing-beating or squawking minute\u2014passed, I took a two-inch step forward and peered around the window molding, an indescribable relief washing over me when all I saw beyond the clear window glass were a few cabs inching along the street and a woman berating a parking meter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My relieved sigh curdled into a scream as that stupid bird launched itself into my line of sight, squawking and flapping like a murderous maniac, the tips of its wings tapping the glass.</p><p>I was reeling backward, vaulting toward the couch when an insistent knock at my door terrified me five times more and I felt every muscle in my body instinctively stiffen. Though my fangs are always exposed, in times of true vampdom\u2014i.e., when an artery needs ravaging or a bartender spills something on my Manolo Blahniks\u2014the fangs extend an extra half-inch causing that frightening scowl you see plastered all over TV. My hackles were up and adrenaline pulsed through me; even my hair seemed to stand on electrified end. My every thought was savagery and a hiss of air sliced through my teeth as I snatched open the door.</p><p>I was met with pursed lips.</p> <p>And a cocked eyebrow.</p><p>And an expression completely devoid of terror or shock.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A guy can\u2019t fly across country to see his favorite aunt?\u201d My nephew was standing in the hallway, framed by chintzy yellow hallway light, grinning like I had just won the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes. His fangs were small but pronounced, pinching against the edges of his upturned lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your favorite aunt, I\u2019m your only aunt.\u201d I addressed him suspiciously and the smile fell from his face.</p> <p>\u201cSo can I come in or not?\u201d</p><p>In the Hollywood sea of vampires with horrible accents, satchels full of graveyard dirt, and the ability to turn into bats\u2014there was one thing they had gotten right: a vampire can\u2019t enter private premises without first being invited. Even if those premises were home to another vampire. I stood aside and opened my arms. \u201cVlad, you are welcome to come into my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Vlad stepped over the threshold, arms crossed in front of his chest. Looming at just over six feet, he looked down at me with one of those noncommittal teenage expressions. A hint of mischief flickered in his dark eyes and I was instantly seized with joy and sadness. Vlad looked so much like his mother\u2014my sister\u2014that it warmed me. But the feeling almost immediately fled because I knew Sonia was dead, would never know that her son was thriving\u2014though undead\u2014or that his Aunt Nina was taking good care of him. She also would never know that Vlad headed up the West Coast division of VERM\u2014the Vampire Empowerment and Restoration Movement\u2014or dressed like a fashionably suicidal cross between Bela Lugosi and Count Chocula.</p><p>Maybe it was better that she stayed in the grave.</p><p>I jumped forward anyway, enveloping Vlad in a crisp hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I am really happy to see you! But, really, what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back in true teenage fashion as though someone would catch wind of the fact that he had shown a modicum of emotion. Vlad may be one hundred and twelve, but he was forever caught in the moody, brooding, obnoxious sentience of a sixteen year old.</p> <p>And he never picked up his socks.</p><p>He threw an Army duffel onto my couch and grinned again. I could tell he just fed by the deep, ruddy pink of his lips.</p><p>\u201cI came to visit you!\u201d</p><p>Now I crossed my arms in front of my chest and cocked a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d</p><p>A sweet innocence flooded over Vlad\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I pulled my cell phone from my jeans pocket and poised a finger over the trackpad. \u201cYou know I have Sophie on speed dial.\u201d In addition to being my roommate in San Francisco, Sophie is Vlad\u2019s partial guardian by proxy, and my very best friend.</p><p>Vlad held up a silencing hand. \u201cOkay, okay. So, there\u2019s some talk that I may have had a tiny indiscretion with a fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairies are awful!\u201d Though Walt Disney painted them with big, kind eyes and pursed pink lips, anyone who\u2019s met one will tell you that fairies\u2014and pixies, too\u2014are awful little buggers. Mean, sassy, stuck-up.</p> <p>And some of them bite.</p><p>\u201cSo you came out here to escape your fairy lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I came out here to escape Kale. You think fairies are bad? Try a jilted teenage witch.\u201d Vlad whipped off his coat, showing off a dark strip on his pale white arm. \u201cThis just happened. She made the sun rise in our damn apartment. That bitch could have killed me!\u201d</p><p>I slung an arm over Vlad\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh, she\u2019d never kill you. Just torture you a little. I like her. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Vlad tugged me close in an awkward hug. \u201cMe, too. It\u2019ll be nice to hang here for a bit. No romantic drama, no bodies dropping from the ceiling or crime scene tape.\u201d He flopped down on the couch next to his duffel and I bit my lip, before perching next to him.</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s not totally drama-free around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right because of your little \u2018fashion war\u2019 with that guy and\u2014what\u2019s her name? Kenmore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerson,\u201d I corrected. \u201cReginald and Emerson. And the war is pretty much over.\u201d</p><p>Vlad gave me an appraising smile. \u201cYou won?\u201d</p><p>I wrinkled my nose. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>He quirked a brow. \u201cSomeone drop out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like dropped dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDropped on her own or . . .\u201d Vlad waggled his eyebrows in the universal \u201cdon\u2019t-make-me-say-it\u201d style.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you kidding me? I had nothing to do with it. It was right next door and it looked like suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Looked like\u2019 suicide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>Vlad pulled a blood bag from his duffel, pierced it with a single fang, and started to suck. He emptied the thing and burped loudly before he addressed me. \u201cSo you made it look like suicide.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look at Vlad full in the face. \u201cAre you seriously asking me if I had anything to do with Reginald\u2019s death? Because I follow the strictest UDA bylaws and even if I were to stray just the slightest\u201d\u2014I held my thumb and forefinger a smidge apart\u2014\u201ctiniest bit, frankly, it wouldn\u2019t be Reginald Fairfield that I\u2019d off. It\u2019d be Emerson Hawk. That woman is vile.\u201d</p><p>Vlad\u2019s eyes flashed.</p><p>As if on cue, there was another insistent, thundering knock on my door. \u201cYou can stay,\u201d I told Vlad as I went to answer it. \u201cPeace and quiet, however,\u201d I said as I snatched open the door. \u201cDied about a week ago.\u201d</p><p>Emerson was standing in the hallway, hip out, arms crossed, beady eyes even beadier though they were rimmed with coal and something hideously sparkly. She had actually brushed her hair and it was in a semi-attractive swoop pinned at the base of her skull, and her black gown had an asymmetrical hemline that was so completely last year it was laughable. But still, the dress was impeccably tailored and the ruched drop waist was understated and elegant, wondrously hiding Emerson\u2019s usual Kentucky Fried Chicken and Yoo-hoo paunch. Nicolette was behind her, back toward me as she hunched, managing two beaded purses in one hand while she struggled to lock Emerson\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cHello, Emerson.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes raked over me, her sour expression not changing. \u201cAren\u2019t you ready yet? Or is that what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What am I wearing for what?\u201d</p><p>Nicolette, having finally gotten the door locked, rushed to Emerson\u2019s side and handed her a heavy ecru card. My stomach sunk as I recognized it.</p><p>\u201cThe cocktail reception.\u201d</p><p>Emerson nodded.</p><p>\u201cSomeone just died. Are they actually still holding that? Only the completely heartless and macabre could think of going through with any of the competition activities right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything was already booked. They couldn\u2019t cancel at the last minute and Mr. Forbes said that everything would go forward as planned. Except of course, with one less fashion show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Mr. Forbes?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Forbes was the head of the New York Design Institute and whether or not you knew your Vera from your Versace could be overlooked if Jason Forbes was on your side.</p><p>A sly grin rolled across her face. \u201cWe may have run into each other a time or two at this quaint little coffee bar I frequent.\u201d</p><p>I was gritting my teeth so hard I imagined them starting to powder. \u201cYou\u2019ve only been in New York a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Jason\u201d\u2014she stressed the name\u2014\u201cthought that the best way to honor Reginald would be to continue on as planned. So, again, are you wearing that? As far as your designs go, it is one of your better ones.\u201d</p><p>My nostrils flared and I felt myself shrink back in my fashion-fail skinny jeans, Ugg boots, and tank top.</p><p>\u201cIs that your date?\u201d Emerson poked a bony finger into my apartment, aiming at Vlad.</p><p>\u201cNephew.\u201d</p><p>Nicolette\u2019s head peeked over Emerson\u2019s shoulder. I saw her cheeks redden when her eyes met Vlad\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the reception.\u201d</p><p>The door had barely slammed before Vlad was at my side, smiling and licking his lips. \u201cWho\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmerson Hawk is hardly a girl. I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s human.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Vlad groaned. \u201cThe other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Emerson\u2019s sister and A, anyone with even an ounce of Emerson Hawk blood in her is completely and totally off limits to you and your undead little friend down there,\u201d I said as my eyes skipped over his zipper, \u201cand B, you\u2019re on the run from one woman and you\u2019re running out of safe houses. So keep it zipped. I have a party to get ready for.\u201d</p><p>The reception for the Institute for Haute Couture was at a swanky restaurant in Chelsea with low lights, polished cement, and an open bar. It was stuffed to the gills with beautiful people in one-of-a-kind dresses, white-gloved waiters wielding untouched appetizer trays, and quite possibly every hair product in the tristate area. My town car let me out in front of the restaurant at the precise time as Emerson\u2019s let her out and even though a grimace would totally throw off the incredible vibe of my gold-threaded vintage Versace, I couldn\u2019t help it when I saw her.</p><p>Emerson strode past me, her beaded clutch almost taking me out as she did. Nicolette, hurrying behind as usual, shot me a small, apologetic smile before she yanked open the door for Emerson. They walked into the restaurant and melted into the crowd; I stepped in and there was an audible gasp.</p> <p>Scanning the room, I could see why.</p><p>Aside from the waiters, the place was a morbid sea of black. Black dresses, black suits, black hair d\u00e9cor that masqueraded as vintage. My gold dress stood out like a shiny beacon and I smiled, accepting my glory while Emerson glowered in the crowd, her drink practically evaporating from the waves of heat that rolled off her.</p><p>The energy in the restaurant was low, most people not knowing whether they should mourn or celebrate. Half a drink in, Jason Forbes took a makeshift stage and made a touching\u2014if quick\u2014toast to Reginald\u2019s life and career then a muted introduction of the contest, Emerson, and me. Directly afterward, the heavy appetizers\u2014and the murmured gossip\u2014started. I carried around a canap\u00e9 and a glass of champagne and flitted from group to group, head cocked, lips in a serene yet friendly smile, ears open.</p><p>I heard that Reginald had offed himself because Felipe was going home to a mystery wife he had back in Brazil. I heard the suicide was due to a fashion line Reginald was hired for that nosedived, taking the entire company with it. I heard that it was drugs, alcohol, carbohydrates. But when I heard that Reginald hadn\u2019t committed suicide at all, I stopped walking.</p><p>A model I knew as Bea was talking, her greasy-plate lips stained a weird glossy orange as she held court.</p> <p>I edged my way in, gushed appropriately, and Bea pulled me into the conversation.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend,\u201d she said, flapping enormous baby-girl lashes. \u201cHe is interested in so many things, so he volunteers at the city morgue.\u201d</p><p>The woman next to me nudged me in the ribs with a bony elbow and mouthed the words \u201ccommunity service.\u201d</p><p>Bea shot her a death glance and kept going. \u201cAdam had to stand by and watch the coroner start the autography.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAutopsy,\u201d I corrected, taking a burning swallow of champagne.</p><p>\u201cRight. They started the preliminary thing and the coroner talks into a tape recorder. Adam heard him say that the . . . the,\u201d Bea said, and made a motion around her neck. \u201cThe rings on Reginald\u2019s neck were not conducted to a death by hanging.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t conducive to a hanging?\u201d</p><p>Bea turned her enormous eyes on me and nodded. \u201cYou heard that, too?\u201d</p><p>I had to physically control myself from rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Bea went on, \u201che said that it looked like Reginald was dead before he could hang himself.\u201d</p><p>The other women in the circle shivered appropriately but I stepped forward. \u201cHow did he die, then?\u201d</p><p>Bea\u2019s tiny bird shoulders rose. \u201cAnd did he hang himself before or after?\u201d</p><p>I handed Bea my champagne glass and beat a hasty retreat\u2014at least I tried to, before coming face to face with Emerson.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s in a hurry,\u201d she said, her eyes raking over me. \u201cNeed to rush off and rip a few seams?\u201d</p> <p>My one-track mind went from checking out Reginald\u2019s not-suicide to wishing Emerson was the one swinging from the rafters.</p><p>I stopped there.</p><p>\u201cHey, Em,\u201d I said, closing the distance between us\u2014and thankful my gag reflex had disappeared along with my soul. \u201cWhat were you doing this morning?\u201d</p><p>She cocked an anemic eyebrow that let me know she suspected something. \u201cI was with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore that.\u201d</p><p>She whipped away from me. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>I sized Emerson up. If Bea was right\u2014and I couldn\u2019t put much stock in that, as she was boobs over brains\u2014and Reginald\u2019s death wasn\u2019t a suicide, could someone like Emerson be responsible?</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><p>Emerson crossed her arms in front of her chest\u2014or attempted to, as her horrid interpretation of sleeves swallowed her up\u2014and flared her nostrils. \u201cNicolette and I were working at the apartment.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, trying to determine if there was something in her voice, her stare that would indicate absolute guilt. I like to think my super-vampire sense would make me particularly good at reading a breather\u2019s emotions, but no.</p><p>\u201cStop staring at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. LaShay!\u201d I felt an arm snake through mine before I heard Jason Forbes\u2019s deep voice\u2014but not before I saw Emerson\u2019s face tighten, her eyes sharp as naked swords.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to catch you. I see you and Ms. Hawk are getting acquainted.\u201d</p><p>I put on my most dazzling smile and nodded. \u201cWe certainly are.\u201d</p><p>Jason pitched his head toward mine, his lips just brushing my ear. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about one of your designs.\u201d</p><p>I kept grinning, enjoying Emerson\u2019s pallor.</p><p>It was at the precise moment that Jason put his hand on my arm that I saw Emerson lurch forward, in the most melodramatic fall I\u2019d seen in lifetimes. I watched the deep, red zinfandel swish from her bowl glass, up, up, up and out, and then I felt the liquid seeping through my dress, dripping over my collarbone, droplets slipping down through my d\u00e9colletage.</p><p>And then all hell broke loose.</p><p>I forgot that Jason Forbes was within wetting distance and screamed, \u201cYou bitch! You did that on purpose!\u201d</p><p>A slick grin rushed across Emerson\u2019s lips before her expression snapped into one of mock apology and horror. \u201cOh, dear, oh! I\u2019m such a klutz. Please, do send me the dry-cleaning bill.\u201d</p><p>People had started to circle now, looking sadly at my spoiled dress\u2014few things moved fashionistas like wounded couture.</p><p>\u201cIf you were worth anything as a designer, you\u2019d know that you don\u2019t dry-clean hand-dyed, vintage Versace.\u201d</p><p>Emerson cocked her head, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s Versace? I think you may have been taken, sweetie. I did the full Versace catalog when I was there,\u201d she said, her voice rising on Versace. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t recall seeing that particular number in their annals.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m usually known for keeping my cool. But tonight, my cool was wrapped around Emerson Hawk\u2019s scraggly neck. Before I realized it we were in a full-on girl-fight, complete with hair pulling and feline scowls. Had my entire life and fashion career not been on the line, I would have gone full-on Lestat on her ass and left picking subpar designer out of my teeth.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God I\u2019m going to murder you!\u201d I growled.</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d Emerson wrinkled her nose. \u201cYour polyester excuse for couture or one of your gag-worthy designs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies, ladies, ladies!\u201d</p><p>I felt strong arms snaking around my waist and suddenly I was off the ground, being pulled backward. I craned my neck to see who my savior/new attackee was and harrumphed when I realized it was Pike. I had expected Jason, but found him standing a few feet away, grinning like someone was about to inflate the ring and fill it with mud. I was so flabbergasted and annoyed that I wasn\u2019t even able to take the time to appreciate being wrapped in Pike\u2019s arms, or how devastatingly handsome he looked in a slim-fitting deconstructed tuxedo, his hair half slicked, half I-just-rolled-out-of-bed sexy.</p><p>He yanked me a good ten feet from Emerson and her weapon of couture destruction but I could still see the sick smile on her face and my rage boiled again.</p><p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d I said between clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019m going to rip her throat out. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s your girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Pike dropped me with a thump. \u201cMy girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I waved at the air. \u201cEx, whatever. She ruined my dress. On purpose. She\u2019s a snarky little snake in the grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, shh, shh. Nina, relax. She is a\u2014what did you call her? Snaky snark? She\u2019s that, which is why you\u2019re not going to let her get you tossed out of this competition.\u201d</p><p>The anger in my gut was slowly, barely, starting to pull back. I glanced at Pike\u2019s earnest expression and then back over my shoulder at Emerson, who was being led toward the back patio, leaning on some poor waiter as if she\u2019d been actually wounded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Three more minutes and she would have been.</p><p>The tone in the restaurant went from high piano notes and polite laughter to throaty \u201cdid you see those two go at it?\u201d whispers and averted eyes.</p><p>Pike handed me a glass of soda water and a thick cloth napkin. I dabbed at my dress delicately, each wine-soaked dab stabbing at my patience a little more. I cut my eyes out toward the patio where someone was trying to engage Emerson in conversation, but she looked up, locked my gaze, and offered a slick, ugly smile.</p> <p>\u201cGame on, bitch,\u201d I muttered under my breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Pike asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why did you think Emerson was my girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>I tossed down my now wine-soaked napkin, something like ruined-man resignation floating over me. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what she told me.\u201d</p> <p>Pike kind of grinned and crossed his arms in front of his chest, the motion pushing aside the collar of his shirt just enough for me to see a smooth, tanned length of neck and collarbone. I could see the beginnings of a thick black tattoo and I had to clench my jaws\u2014and my knees\u2014to keep from examining it closer. \u201cAnd did that make you mad?\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled with the kind of mischief that shot adrenaline and hormones throughout my body\u2014dead or not. I licked my lips and tossed a length of slick black hair over my shoulder. \u201cDo you want it to make me mad?\u201d</p><p>Pike shrugged, took a long pull on the beer I didn\u2019t know he was holding. \u201cNah, I just didn\u2019t want you to feel bad.\u201d</p><p>I blinked my confusion. Was he just a terrible flirt . . . or really that dense?</p><p>His eyes dropped to my dress. \u201cYou should probably get out of that dress.\u201d</p><p>Another zing pinballed throughout my body. Maybe he wasn\u2019t such a bad flirt after all.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dry cleaner about a block down. Ask for Mrs. Cho; she can get out anything.\u201d Pike turned on his heel and left me standing, wet, confused, and annoyed in the center of the party.</p><p>I left shortly after, grumbling the whole cab ride home and doing that odd, legs apart, my-dress-is-soaked-and-chafing kind of walk. All I wanted was to pull on my cozy cashmere sweat suit (terry cloth is so pass\u00e9) and sink my teeth into a still-warm blood bag. And that\u2019s what I would have done, if that stupid blackbird\u2014he was taunting me, I was sure of it\u2014hadn\u2019t been pacing on the front stoop.</p><p>I paused and glared down at the thing, waving my hands but keeping my distance. \u201cShooo! Shooo! You shouldn\u2019t be walking anyway. Fly you little bastard!\u201d</p><p>The thing paused, cocked its disease-infested head and spread its wings wide as if it understood me.</p><p>Nina LaShay: bird whisperer.</p><p>Then it snapped those wings against its little bird body and glared.</p><p>I chanced a swift kick and a sprint when a damp bugle bead started to dig into my flesh. I felt the flap of the blackbird\u2019s wings and snapped the door shut on its protesting scowl.</p><p>\u201cI warned you!\u201d I screamed, pressing my face up against the glass in the door. The bird fluttered down to the stoop again, unharmed but, I thought, with a murderous look in its eye.</p> <p>I was going to have to hire an exterminator.</p><p>The following morning I was hell-bent on restoring my reputation or, failing that, blowing everyone on the judging panel away with my incredible designs. Which was why I was at the Fashion Institute when most breathers were pulling their pillows over their heads or indulging in their last half hour of REM sleep. Though New York was truly a city that never slept, it did seem to take the occasional doze\u2014apparently between four-thirty and five A.M.\u2014because it was decidedly, delectably calm right up until I keyed the passcode at the Institute. I was halfway through the four-digit super-secret code when the front door slammed open and I went chest to chest\u2014then butt to cement with\u2014</p><p>\u201cPike?\u201d</p><p>He was still dressed in his cocktail-hour deconstructed tuxedo but this morning\u2019s look was for more deconstructed than it was tuxedo. His carefully disheveled hair was actually disheveled and he sported a spray of dark stubble over his upper lip and chin. He brushed a hand over the would-be beard when he glanced down at me, his eyes wild and disturbingly alive.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nina, my God, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d It came out as one long string and I avoided the hand he offered, suddenly strangely suspicious. He may have once (yesterday) been my gorgeous future soul mate, but he was tainted by fashion thief Emerson, and was now running out of a building where my designs were supposed to be safe.</p><p>I pushed myself to standing, feeling my eyes narrow as I scrutinized him, and saw the barely imperceptible way his head reared back from my examination. There were no telltale bulges where he might have hidden my patterns or design notes\u2014and I looked carefully, examining every bulge.</p><p>We vampires like to be incredibly thorough. I like to be incredibly thorough.</p><p>I smelled beer on Pike\u2019s morning-after breath and his whole countenance was agitated, guarded.</p><p>\u201cAre you high?\u201d I asked, my arms crossing in front of my chest.</p><p>Pike actually stopped and seemed to settle, his pale lips quirking upward. \u201cHigh? May have had a few beers to wash down my Wheaties but nothing more. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a show to prepare for. And a passcode. How did you get in here? Why did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>Pike\u2019s sudden coolness ticked all the way through him and he patted the black camera bag that crossed his chest. \u201cWorking. I was here working.\u201d</p><p>My eyes raked over his attire and I cocked out a hip. \u201cYou were up all night shooting designs for designers who were fast asleep in their own homes? Or, you know,\u201d I said and licked my lips, trying to conjure up the best word. \u201cDead?\u201d</p><p>Pike was unfazed. He actually looked cooler than before as he eyed me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to believe you were one of those fast asleep at home?\u201d</p><p>Truth was, I\u2019d spent my evening starring as Roxie Hart in an off-Broadway production of Chicago. Well, not so much an off-Broadway production as a karaoke bar with beer-stained carpet, but this grungy photog didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>I just raised my eyebrows until Pike rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t only work for the Institute, you know.\u201d</p><p>He brushed past me as though that were all the explanation I needed and even though his pain-in-the-ass quotient went up to about a thousand, I couldn\u2019t help but sneak a peek and notice that his regular ass quotient still hovered somewhere between perfection and breathtaking. I watched him hail a cab with lightning speed, the yellow thing disappearing down the street.</p><p>I rode the crotchety old elevator (what is it with breathers and their need for all things retro?) up to the design studio and felt little butterfly flaps of anxiety in my belly. I have dreamed of having my own little studio since the early 1900s\u2014you should have seen Coco\u2019s little place in Paris!\u2014and now, because of this design opportunity, I had it.</p><p>Well, almost.</p><p>One of the enormous benefits of this competition was that both Emerson and I were awarded top-notch design studios\u2014 outfitted with the latest and greatest of everything\u2014in which to baste, steam, slice, and create the designs for each of our competing lines.</p><p>The enormous matching drawback was that each of these incredible studios shared floor space with each other. I had a bank of floor-to-ceiling cabinets and hanging closets at the front end of the room; Emerson had an identical setup on her side. We each had huge drafting and cutting tables, dual sewing machines, maiden forms, and steamers. As designers, all we needed to bring were our designs, our fabric bolts, and our personal tools. Where I traveled with a lucky pair of scissors, a seam ripper called Marie Antoinette, and a pincushion in the shape of a mushroom, I was fairly sure that Emerson only packed a tape recorder and a notebook titled \u201cDesigns I Stole.\u201d</p><p>But it was nice this morning as the sun started to break through the heavy gray fog and the entire studio was peaceful, quiet, and Emerson-free.</p><p>I went to work outlining a new design and when the spark of inspiration slipped from the page and pointed at my rack of newly designed dresses, I couldn\u2019t help but snatch one from the rack and grab my lucky scissors.</p><p>Only, they weren\u2019t there.</p><p>I tore apart my pink-rhinestoned tool kit and then went to work opening every drawer and yanking open every closet. Finally, I dropped to my knees in a desperate hope that my lucky pair had slipped from their holster. I patted and searched until my knees felt knobby and raw\u2014and I was facing Emerson\u2019s side of the room.</p><p>I felt my hackles go up, a hot stripe of rage going from the base of my head to the end of my spine.</p><p>She did it.</p><p>Emerson Hawk stole my lucky shears.</p><p>I heard the electric lock tumbling downstairs, the ping! and rush of elevators coming to life as the people started to make their way into the building.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much time.</p><p>I sprinted the fifty feet across the room and grabbed at Emerson\u2019s drawers, tearing through them like a burglar with a serious mission. In the back of my head I heard the footsteps and early-morning chatter as students and designers closed in on our room and when I grabbed the handle of Emerson\u2019s closet door\u2014the one marked \u201cpersonal\u201d\u2014I was in such a fury that I didn\u2019t care as the voices closed in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I should have.</p><p>It all happened in one elongated second\u2014my hand closing on the knob; the voices of the contest director and models breaking over the threshold. Me pulling the closet door open. Emerson line-driving me from the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they fighting again?\u201d</p><p>Though Emerson jumped out of her closet and pummeled me\u2014then lay there like a dead weight\u2014she was no match for my strength so I quickly rolled her off me, but in that millisecond my nostrils twitched and my mouth started to water. It wasn\u2019t her usual noxious scent. It was something very, very different.</p><p>Heavy. Metallic.</p><p>Blood.</p> <p>I felt my mouth drop open and my eyes bulge when I stared at my blood-covered hands, at the smear across my blouse.</p><p>And then I looked at Emerson.</p><p>\u201cOh, my\u2014\u201d I started to kick away, felt the inane need to put distance between me and her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d one of the models asked.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Jason Forbes rushed toward me and Emerson. \u201cAre you okay? What happened? If you ladies can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Jason paused, looked down at Emerson, and then crouched slowly. A chalky white washed over his face. He glanced at me and I knew exactly what the hard look in his eyes meant: Emerson Hawk was dead. When I crawled over to see for myself, I wished I was, too.</p><p>Sticking out of Emerson\u2019s concave chest were my lucky scissors. And it didn\u2019t take an X-ray to figure out that their sharp double-blades were wedged firmly and deeply into her silent heart.</p> <p>From the moment Emerson\u2019s lifeless body hit mine to the second she was being zipped into a slick black coroner\u2019s bag could have been five minutes or five hours. The studio was a buzz of muffled conversations and accusatory glances. I wanted nothing more than to crawl back to the cool, dark cave of an apartment and sort out what had just happened\u2014and what it meant. I was ready to dash when a fat, round detective sidled up to me, flipping open his little leather notebook and breathing at me with his coffee breath. I had expected Officer Hopkins, but the gentleman before me was built like a fireplug and wearing his ill-fitting cotton-poly off-the-rack suit like it was an Armani.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of the previous case but I\u2019m not at liberty to talk about it.\u201d He shifted his eyes as though everyone were about to pounce in an attempt to overhear us.</p><p>\u201cIt just seems odd that they\u2019d send a detective out for this case but not Reginald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are Nina LaShay, right?\u201d the detective said, completely ignoring my question.</p><p>I nodded silently, my arms wrapped around my chest, gripping my elbows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Detective Moyer. You were the last to see the decedent alive, were you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014no, not that I know of.\u201d An image of Pike rushing out looking disheveled and nervous flashed through my mind, the image flitting so quickly I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. \u201cI saw her last night and then,\u201d I gestured to the closet door, still gaping open, its emptiness a quiet screech that Emerson Hawk was dead.</p><p>\u201cThen you found her this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe . . . kind of . . . found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you and the decedent friends, Ms. LaShay?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to focus on answering the detective\u2019s questions, but every time he asked me anything, he smacked his lips in a weird kind of final gesture and it was turning my stomach. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we were friends, exactly. We were colleagues. And competitors.\u201d</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t been staring at Moyer\u2019s fat, pale lips making that stupid smacking sound, I would have thought better of telling this man\u2014who was tapping the end of his pen, looking thoughtfully at me\u2014that I might have had motive to kill Emerson. I thought of Hopkins and his accusatory stare and then longed for it as Moyer\u2019s eyebrows went up. He poised the pen over his notepad as though he were about to take down some frantic confession, and any inch of confidence I was harboring wilted.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you two got into some kind of argument last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly call it an argument. Just a little disagreement. Emerson spilled a little wine on my dress, that\u2019s all.\u201d And by a \u201clittle wine\u201d I meant half a bottle and by \u201con my dress\u201d I meant soaked clean through until I had a faint purplish hue when I finally stripped the soaked garment off. I shrugged and tried to smile. \u201cCrowded party and . . . accidents happen.\u201d</p><p>Accident my slightly purple ass.</p><p>Moyer cocked his head. He was a one hundred percent cardboard cutout of every other detective my San Francisco roommate DVR\u2019d each week, right down to his bulbous red nose and the aforementioned \u201cisn\u2019t it true.\u201d</p><p>There was an uncomfortable beat of silence as though Moyer expected me to say more.</p><p>\u201cAnd, that\u2019s it,\u201d I said.</p><p>Moyer cocked a single caterpillar eyebrow and shot me one of those \u201cprove it to me\u201d expressions. The kind of expression that is so disconcerting it encourages perfectly innocent and well-read people to start babbling like psychopathic idiots. I was a solid four minutes into my soliloquy that contained a good selection of incriminating myself and backpedaling when my voice was drowned out by the ridiculously loud squawking of a black bird pacing the ledge of the open window.</p><p>My God, New York was infested.</p><p>Though I pathologically hate birds\u2014not fear, hate\u2014as I mentioned before, I could have run up and kissed this one on its filth-infested birdie beak for creating just the distraction that allowed me a millisecond to give myself a mental head-slap and take the vampire equivalent of a deep, calming breath.</p><p>My mouth fell open again at the precise time the bird\u2019s beak cracked wide, as though the foul thing was watching me.</p><p>\u201cSomeone shoo that bird away,\u201d Detective Moyer said, clearly annoyed.</p><p>One of the pup cops used his hat to bat at the screen and the black bird did a patronizing flap of its enormous wings, circling about six inches from the ledge, still squawking like a maniac.</p><p>Moyer blew out a disgusted sigh and raked a fat hand over his round face. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to have you come down to the station to answer some questions,\u201d he said finally. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and glanced out the window, the sun catching the heavy leaded glass. Just the glare stung my bare shoulders and I inched away. \u201cCan we finish the interview downstairs? Or in a non\u2013bird-infested room? I just would like to not be here.\u201d</p><p>Moyer looked around, his eyes landing on the pattern spread on my table, edged by a heap of fabric scraps.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about? You one of the, er, sewing students?\u201d</p><p>I felt myself stiffen even though I knew it was not the time to throw my weight(lessness) around. \u201cI\u2019m a designer, actually. This\u201d\u2014I gestured to the tables, the dresses, the patterns\u2014\u201cis a contest. A competition.\u201d I swallowed, thinking of the swish-swish sound Reginald\u2019s shoes made as they scraped across the dining table, thinking of Emerson\u2019s sightless eyes, the slack in her jaw as it stayed open, forever frozen in surprise.</p><p>Moyer eyed the fabric swatches and then eyed me, skepticism written all over his face. \u201cLike a TV thing?\u201d</p><p>I was about to correct him, but instead bet on the draw-to-Hollywood that most breathers in this anyone-can-be-a-star decade seemed to have. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I pumped my head, growing more excited and happy that the majority of my never-lie-to-a-cop morals disappeared when my soul did. \u201cReality TV.\u201d</p><p>Detective Moyer\u2019s spider-veined cheeks reddened and pushed up into a smile. \u201cIs that model going to be here?\u201d He looked around as though we were storing her in a closet or a drawer. \u201cThe blonde one? The host? She\u2019s from Sweden or Switzerland. Saskatchewan or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, absolutely,\u201d I said.</p><p>If necessary, I\u2019m sure I could scare up a Saskatchewan model somewhere, right?</p><p>Moyer straightened his tie and yanked his pants up over his enormous keg of a belly, his eyes scanning the studio as if he had simply overlooked an enormous camera crew.</p><p>\u201cAre you miked?\u201d he asked in a gruff, low murmur.</p><p>\u201cMiked?\u201d</p><p>He raised his bushy eyebrows and I was amused and horrified that this man of the law would be so into grabbing his fifteen minutes that he would use a homicide to get there. And to get a piece of prime Saskatchewan model ass, apparently.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, leaning in. \u201cThis isn\u2019t part of the show.\u201d</p><p>I watched Moyer\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bob as he considered. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you down in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>My feet hadn\u2019t so much as touched the lobby\u2019s deco marbled floor when Pike met me at the elevator.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d I wanted to know. \u201cComing back to make sure the job is done?\u201d</p><p>Pike\u2019s eyebrows went up and I tried my best to gauge everything about him\u2014his body heat, the thunder of his heart\u2014but he stayed completely still and relaxed.</p><p>It\u2019s too bad the good-looking ones are always sociopaths.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>I poked his chest with my index finger. \u201cI know what you did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know that I got shit-faced drunk and slept in the stairwell because I lost my keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost your keys?\u201d</p><p>Pike looked sheepish. \u201cThey were in my pants.\u201d</p> <p>I glanced down and realized that Pike was wearing a pair of ill-fitting pants instead of the slim pair that went with his suit. Perhaps earlier, I was too busy looking for bulges instead of the poorly stiched seams and unnatural fabrics to notice the change. But I still wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cSo you lost your pants and your keys.\u201d</p><p>Pike nodded then held my gaze, his eyes meltingly delicious and for the briefest of moments I considered what life with a serial killer might be like.</p><p>I shook myself from my revelry. \u201cThat\u2019s a convenient story.\u201d</p><p>The other elevator plinged! and Detective Moyer stepped out with another officer who was carrying two steaming cups of coffee. Moyer nodded to Pike, who raised his own paper coffee cup to the man.</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes. \u201cYou know Detective Moyer?\u201d</p><p>Pike\u2019s eyes cut to me as the steam wisped from around his deep brown eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I work for a lot of people? Sometimes even the NYPD.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I felt myself grimace. \u201cCrime scene photographer.\u201d</p><p>I glanced back at where Moyer and the pup cop were setting themselves up, then back at Pike.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019d better stay around. They want to know who saw Emerson last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why do you think that was me?\u201d</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes and Pike narrowed his right back at me and stepped a little closer, his nose\u2014his lips\u2014barely inches from mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you accusing me of something, Ms. LaShay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. LaShay?\u201d It was Moyer\u2019s deep voice and he was looking over his shoulder at me now, those heavy brows raised expectantly.</p><p>I poked Pike in the chest. \u201cWe\u2019re not done.\u201d</p><p>And though there is no reason in this realm or the other that it should have, the second we touched, a spark shot through me like delicious wildfire. I pulled my finger back as though it burned but it was too late; Pike\u2019s eyes were low and hooded, and the half-inch of smile on his pursed lips let me know that he felt it, too.</p><p>Moyer asked me a rather routine, CSI-type series of questions that I answered with the practiced unease of someone who had seen her first dead body. No one needed to know that back home in San Francisco, my every day was spent with the dead. New York may be the city that never sleeps, but San Francisco was the city that never dies.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Moyer said, his pale eyes scanning his notebook as his meat hook of a hand started to close it. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty much all we need.\u201d</p><p>I stood up, but Moyer stopped me. \u201cOh, Ms. LaShay, just one more thing. Did you recognize the scissors that were used to kill Ms. Hawk?\u201d</p> <p>My whole body stiffened and if my heart still beat, I knew it would be up in my throat, clanging like a fire bell. I swallowed slowly. \u201cThey were mine.\u201d</p><p>The buzz and hum of the active lobby was suddenly plunged into a deep, uncomfortable silence as though everyone\u2014from the half-conscious security guard to the honking cabbies right outside the door\u2014had heard me.</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to lie, to shrug it off, but those scissors would be dislodged from Emerson\u2019s chest eventually, and when they were, they would see my name engraved right across the blade.</p><p>\u201cMs. LaShay, I\u2019m going to have to ask that you don\u2019t leave town until we have this all sorted out. You\u2019re free to contact your lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lawyer?\u201d I felt myself blanch. \u201cAm I\u2014am I suspected of something?\u201d</p><p>Moyer didn\u2019t answer me but his expression told me that his answer was nothing that I wanted to hear.</p><p>A cold stripe of fear shot down my spine and my whole body rang electric. I may have fangs, I may have walked this earth for centuries, but right now, I was in deep, deep trouble.</p><p>I handed the cabbie several crumpled bills and pushed my way into the apartment vestibule, sinking my key into the lock. It had only been a day, but I already couldn\u2019t remember not feeling like my body was covered with the stench of death (and not the good kind), or when I didn\u2019t want to slink out of my clothes, burn them\u2014which is high holy treason with a wardrobe like mine\u2014or slip away to parts unknown. I pulled out my cell again and hit speed dial again.</p><p>\u201cUnderworld Detection Agency, San Francisco. This is Kale. How may I direct your call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Kale, it\u2019s Nina. Can you put me through to legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Kale\u2019s voice brightened, then dropped to a low whisper. \u201cCan you do me a favor and tell Vlad something?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cWho told you he was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond\u2014or backpedal\u2014Kale had put me through to legal where my \u201ccall was very important to them and would be answered in the order it was received.\u201d I drummed my fingers on my purse while listening to an instrumental version of \u201c(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\u201d and told myself that I would deal with Kale\u2019s Easter egg hunt later.</p><p>I was still on hold when I made it to the fourth floor, a perky UDA employee breaking in between during \u201cA Groovy Kind of Love\u201d to ask me if I knew I could file most basic UDA legal documents online. I clicked my phone off, depressed at my lack of a solution and dearly missing the good, old-fashioned slam of a receiver on its base.</p><p>Sliding an icon wasn\u2019t very satisfying.</p><p>I was standing in front of Reginald\u2019s door now, one piddling strip of crime-scene tape strung across the jamb, the door sealed with a flashy red sticker warning that no one other than the police, an inspector, or the coroner was permitted entry.</p><p>\u201cOr the resident vampire,\u201d I muttered under my breath before taking my fresh manicure to the thing.</p><p>Once the sticker was slit, I was surprised to find the door unlocked. I slipped into the apartment and winced, getting another sickly sweet hit of that new-dead smell.</p><p>I crossed the living room and cracked the kitchen window, letting the musty scent of New York summer seep in, letting the throb and bustle of the city pierce the silence.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Reginald, show me something that will help me.\u201d</p><p>But there was nothing overtly cluelike in the apartment. The furniture, modern and standoffish, was pristine, not even bearing a telltale crease where some murderer may have taken respite after his job was done. There was nothing\u2014except . . .</p><p>I climbed up onto the dining table, careful to skirt the dark smudges where Reginald\u2019s shoes had scraped, and rolled up onto my tiptoes. There, on the top of one of the exposed beams, was a forgotten scrap of fabric\u2014Emerson\u2019s fabric. The fabric that Reginald\u2019s murderer had tightened around Reginald\u2019s neck until he had stopped breathing. I shuddered, pulled my barrette from my hair, and used it as a sort of makeshift, evidence-sustaining pair of tweezers and grabbed the swatch.</p><p>Other than the raggedy ends where the fabric had ripped, there was nothing significant or incriminating about it. The strip was about two inches wide, followed the print of the fabric, but was cut against the grain. No name plates, no fingerprints, no \u201cif found please return to.\u201d I held it up to my nose, whiffing the slightest scent of tuberose and freesia locked into the stitch. Apparently it hadn\u2019t been in Emerson\u2019s apartment long enough to adopt her scent.</p><p>There was nothing and I was annoyed, but I shoved the scrap in my pocket anyway, jumping off the table and closing Reginald\u2019s door behind me.</p><p>What a waste.</p><p>I was only able to grumble for a millisecond; a feeling of stiff unease washed down the skinny hallway and my hackles went up. I spun, staring down Emerson\u2019s closed door.</p><p>My nostril flicked.</p><p>Emerson\u2019s patchouli smell still hung light on the air, but there was something else now, too, something that wasn\u2019t there earlier.</p><p>And then there was the slightest, softest sound.</p><p>A footstep.</p><p>Someone, doing their best to step lightly, to carefully avoid the creaking floorboards. A drawer slid open. Someone rifling.</p><p>I slowly wrapped my palm around Emerson\u2019s doorknob and was met with a lock. I bit my bottom lip, considering.</p><p>Then I slid a bobby pin out of my extensive updo (which was quickly falling due to my surprisingly helpful multiuse of barrettes and pins) and quietly stuck it into the lock. A single jiggle and the lock popped, the door popping open a millimeter. I pushed it open a tiny bit more and sucked in my stomach\u2014a human habit that hadn\u2019t yet died\u2014peering into the apartment.</p><p>It was quiet, and the heaps of clothing and crap all around could have signaled that Emerson\u2019s place had just been ransacked, or that Emerson employed the same kind of housekeeping style my roommate did back at home: slob chic.</p><p>I slid through the doorway, head cocked, still listening. Whoever was inside paused, because suddenly the room went uncomfortably still.</p><p>But the scent was still there.</p><p>I scanned the room, my footfalls silent even on the squeaky floorboard (we vamps have no discernible weight) and stopped short when I saw Emerson\u2019s sketchbook laid out on the glass-topped kitchen table. It was open to a black-draped design that was a mirror image of something I had been working on and everything in me started to boil. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which was probably why I didn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>He clamped one leather-gloved hand around my waist and another around my mouth and dragged me backward. I tried to dig my heels into the heavy carpet to slow him down but my weightlessness worked against me and it was an easy slide. I tried kicking and punching, but with my assailant behind me, firmly clasping me against his chest, it was futile.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d I growled against the man\u2019s hand, feeling the angle on my fangs sharpening.</p> <p>He responded by tightening his grip and I opened my mouth, sinking my teeth into his palm.</p><p>He howled and pulled away from me; I lurched for the vase on the counter, swinging it hard. Water and roses shot out in a clear arc and the heavy leaded crystal made a pleasing, smacking sound when it caught my attacker square in the jaw. I thought it would stop him but the shot only angered him and his hands were on me, grabbing fistfuls of shirt. I was off my feet and face to face with eyes that spit white-hot anger.</p><p>A voice echoing in the hallway startled us both and I was tossed to the side, landing in a crumbled heap in a pile of discarded muslin sketch paper. My assailant cast one backward glance at me, cracked open the living room window, and disappeared onto the fire escape.</p><p>I sat up like a shot\u2014vampire pride wounded, the strap on my Jimmy Choo busted, and pulsing with rage. I vaulted toward the window and followed the black-clad man out onto the fire escape for exactly forty-five seconds. He shot an upward glance at me as he climbed down the escape ladders. His eyes widened and his mouth dropped open just the tiniest bit and I knew he saw the smoke, the little burst of fire as it pierced my skin and singed my hair. I edged back as far from the single flicker of fire bringing sunlight that I could, patting my shoulder and trying to put out the flame. I slapped it out. It smoldered, smoked, and seemed to die, only to pop once again like a cobra dancing out of its basket.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p> <p>My entire body was rigid and the tension pulsed through me like an electric shock as Pike lunged out the window for me and dragged me inside. He pressed a dishtowel against my shoulder, holding and waiting until the flame died out. He folded up the blackened towel and tossed it on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Pike asked me. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I figured if I drew his attention away from my little Sterno moment, he might forget about it. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? I live here.\u201d</p><p>He pointed. \u201cYou live there. This is Emerson\u2019s place and you were on fire.\u201d</p><p>I harrumphed. \u201cI was on fire? You were seeing things, dude. I was just smoking.\u201d</p><p>Pike cocked a disbelieving eyebrow.</p> <p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s a foul habit. I\u2019m trying to quit. Got one of those patch things, and some of that gum . . .\u201d I was rambling.</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to come over to Emerson\u2019s house to indulge in this foul habit?\u201d</p><p>I offered him my \u201cduh, isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d shrug. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Pike took a step toward me. \u201cI was actually heading over to your place to check in on you.\u201d A tiny blush shot over his cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t have your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how\u2019d you end up here?\u201d</p><p>He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \u201cYou left Emerson\u2019s door open. And after I saw that Reginald\u2019s place had been opened, I thought I\u2019d see what was going on.\u201d</p><p>He looked earnest enough but a girl doesn\u2019t walk the earth for centuries and (continue) to be fooled by a pair of gorgeous eyes and well-tanned swimmer\u2019s shoulders that slouched pitifully.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you weren\u2019t coming to my place to kill me?\u201d</p> <p>Pike took another step and I backed up against the window, instinctually. I felt the singe on my back but I needed to put as much distance between him and me as possible.</p><p>He cocked a grin that would have been heartwarming, had he not been a psychopath. \u201cWhy would I kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I saw you this morning. Drunk or not, you were leaving the scene of a crime. If I tell the cops . . .\u201d</p><p>Still grinning. \u201cHaving another cigarette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re smoking again.\u201d</p><p>I felt my brow furrow and put my hands on my hips, feeling indignant. \u201cI\u2019m smoking? I\u2019m not smoking anything, Pike. I saw you well and fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, striding toward me, pointing. \u201cYou\u2019re actually smoking.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder just in time to see a plume of gray-black smoke rise up from my shoulder blade and the cotton strap of my tank top engulfed by a tiny flame.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>Pike had me in his arms in a split second and was wrapping me in one of Emerson\u2019s discarded muslin swatches. He spun me as he wrapped and before I knew it, I was fairly well mummified.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I think it\u2019s out.\u201d I tried to wiggle my arms but they were clamped to my sides. \u201cA little help?\u201d</p><p>Pike pulled a chair out from Emerson\u2019s drafting table and plopped himself down. He kicked up his feet and crossed his own arms in front of his chest. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>He wagged his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to help you get out of that until you answer some questions for me.\u201d</p><p>I tried to take a step, but my legs were clamped too. I considered a Hulk-like show of vampire prowess, but then I\u2019d have some explaining to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of girl catches on fire and doesn\u2019t know it?\u201d</p><p>I bit down hard, feeling the edge of my fangs slicing into my gums.</p><p>Looks like I would have some explaining to do, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d I asked, chin hitched.</p><p>\u201cBecause I just walked in on a woman snooping around a dead woman\u2019s place, and said woman\u2014the first one\u2014caught on fire.\u201d</p><p>I tried to shrug nonchalantly. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there is no fire around. And I had to tell you that you were on fire. Who does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpontaneous combustion happens, Pike. Look it up on Wikipedia.\u201d</p><p>He cocked a disbelieving eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me sit down at least?\u201d</p><p>I started to take a series of minuscule steps while Pike pulled a chair out for me. He put his large hands over my shoulder and that same spark shot through me, making every hair on my swaddled arms stand on end. But I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d I said, maneuvering myself into the chair. I sat down hard, feeling Emerson\u2019s cheap chair selection ringing up my tailbone. \u201cThis is rather uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>Pike sat across from me and narrowed his eyes into what I figured he supposed was an intimidating glare. I rubbed the tip of my tongue over one fang and felt my stomach growl when my eyes fell to the thick vein in his neck, pumping fresh blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d I tried to shrug. \u201cWhat the hell do you want to ask me?\u201d</p><p>Now Pike leaned back and kicked one ankle over his knee. I told myself that the constant salivation was a result of skipping my breakfast pouch and had nothing to do with the way his jeans rode up at the thighs or the way he pursed his red, full lips.</p><p>I bit mine.</p><p>\u201cApart from this whole thing,\u201d he said, gesturing to the apartment. \u201cHow do you know Emerson?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. Why were the pretty ones always so dumb?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both fashion designers. We meet up at events and she\u2019s a two-faced design stealer.\u201d Pike\u2019s eyebrows rose and I hurriedly tacked on, \u201cGod rest her soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you and she weren\u2019t friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave you that impression, Colombo?\u201d</p><p>Pike blew out a sigh. \u201cSo before you,\u201d he cleared his throat, \u201ccaught fire, what were you doing here? Stealing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing my own designs? Hardly. I was looking for clues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClues?\u201d</p><p>I was getting frustrated and the muslin was starting to chafe. \u201cAbout who killed Emerson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hated her, why would you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a good fucking person, okay?\u201d I stopped trying to hide my annoyance, and that seemed to make Pike crack a self-appreciative grin. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that. Good fucking people don\u2019t burst into flames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook it up!\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Pike popped out of his chair. \u201cCan I take a picture of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can sell it to some bondage website? Hell no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll cut you free.\u201d He produced a pocketknife and flicked it open. He didn\u2019t look menacing nor did he brandish the weapon in any way other than to show me he had it, but my hackles went up.</p><p>This guy wanted something.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked, suspicion shading my voice.</p><p>Pike leaned toward me and gingerly edged the tip of the knife into a piece of muslin, directly between my breasts. \u201cNothing, Nina. Just a nice, normal, honest-to-goodness photo of you.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down at the tip of the blade resting an inch from my chest. He could plunge the thing in with all his might and nothing would happen. I\u2019d keep (not) breathing, blinking, and looking very much alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the blood-free wound would be a little bit more difficult to explain than my completely plausible spontaneous combustion explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Pike asked, his voice slow, his eyes wickedly alive with something that looked only vaguely human.</p><p>\u201cA San Franciscan,\u201d I tried.</p> <p>The blade came a hair closer, and I heard the distinctive sound of muslin starting to split. \u201cWhat. Are. You.\u201d Every word was its own sentence, each punctuated by Pike\u2019s wild eyes.</p><p>I considered letting him stab me, then breaking out of my mummy costume and ripping his idiot throat out. But UDA law strictly forbade that kind of thing, even if your local breather was a nosy asshat.</p><p>Or so fiercely handsome that this completely unfortunate situation left a fire between my legs while I tried to lean into his blade. There was something sexy, something so undeniably hot about Pike\u2019s hard-set eyes, about the danger of that slick blade resting between my breasts.</p><p>I locked Pike\u2019s eyes, hoping my coal-black ones were as hard or as deep as his. I ran my tongue over my teeth and my mouth dropped open as Pike leaned into me. I could hear his heartbeat speed up. I could hear the blood as it pulsed through his veins. Could feel the hot moisture from his lips as he breathed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApartment sixty-one A, right here on the right.\u201d It was the landlord, his voice a combination of asthma and Jersey\u2014and he wasn\u2019t alone. Another voice\u2014low, gruff.</p><p>\u201cDetective Moyer,\u201d I whispered to Pike.</p><p>His face paled when the doorknob rattled and before I knew it, I was staring at Emerson\u2019s ugly carpet while Pike carried me over his shoulder and shoved me\u2014and then himself\u2014into the bedroom closet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you\u2014\u201d I started to hiss but he stopped me with a scathing look and a finger pressed to his lips as we heard the landlord, the detective, and, I figured, one or two of the pup cops, filing into Emerson\u2019s living room.</p><p>\u201cShut up or they\u2019re hauling us both off to jail,\u201d Pike said with a low hiss.</p><p>There was something about his sudden slip into alpha male that was sexy and, growing slightly more comfortable in my muslin shackles, I leaned back into Emerson\u2019s patchouli-scented clothes until my shoulder blades went flush with the back wall. Pike ducked and joined me in the black depths of the closet, our bodies hidden by the shapeless black clothing. I would have commented on the horror of it, but Pike had to press up against me to stay hidden. His back was to the door, his front pressed against mine, his outstretched arms essentially caging me in.</p> <p>Something inside me started to flutter.</p><p>Something inside him started to harden.</p><p>\u201cI guess we know what turns you on,\u201d I said slyly.</p><p>Pike rolled his eyes, edged over, and fished his knife from his pocket. I hoped he couldn\u2019t see my face fall in the darkness and went back to my pissed-off girl expression. \u201cHow are we supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Pike clapped a hand over my mouth and pressed himself against me yet again. I trained my eyes to focus on the ceiling, suddenly glad my arms were bound to my sides because they were aching to wrap around him even as I tried to ignore how perfectly our bodies seemed to fit together.</p><p>\u201cLooks clear in here, boss,\u201d one of the pup cops was saying. I could hear him turning fabric swatches in his hands, then I chanced a glance at Pike. His eyes were hard and round, drawing me in, his lips a half-inch from mine. I watched him purse them into a small pucker and for a fleeting second I weighed the idea of mauling this man right here in a dead girl\u2019s apartment. It seemed like the wrong thing to do, but I found myself pulling toward him, a stripe of desire running like razor wire down my spine.</p><p>\u201cGibbs,\u201d Moyer barked, \u201cthis way.\u201d</p><p>When Pike pressed a single finger against his puckered lips, I thought my innards would explode\u2014with embarrassment, rage, or unquenched desire, I couldn\u2019t be sure\u2014but held myself statue-still when I heard the closet door open, a yellow orb of light penetrating the closet\u2019s darkness.</p> <p>Through a drooping lapel and a circa 1982 butterflied collar I could see Detective Moyer\u2019s bloodshot eyes, his meat-hook hand directing the flashlight over Emerson\u2019s clothes. Pike held his breath but his heart kept thumping against my chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Detective Morris said to the clothes. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s the same guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMO was the same. Woman, twenty-three to twenty-seven, killed in her workplace with a weapon of opportunity. I\u2019d say that\u2019s our guy.\u201d I could see Gibbs behind the detective, shrugging, just before Moyer closed the door on us.</p><p>\u201cThat guy\u2019s a serial, and this Hawk girl isn\u2019t his type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d</p><p>I heard Moyer suck on his teeth. \u201cYou know what? I like that LaShay girl for this one.\u201d</p><p>Pike looked down at me, and my eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the black hair who found her? She\u2019s a tiny little thing. She may have done in the second one, but you think she could have gotten Fairfield, too? She couldn\u2019t have gotten him up there,\u201d Gibbs said.</p><p>\u201cShe could have a partner. I don\u2019t know; maybe this competition was that important to her. Important enough to kill. It\u2019s supposed to be on TV, you know. That could have stressed her to the point of popping off her competitors. Between you and me, she seems a few slices short of a grilled cheese.\u201d</p><p>I bristled while Pike clapped a hand over his mouth, stifling a laugh. I glared at him, hoping to convey serial murderer seriousness, but he kept looking over my head.</p><p>Finally, I felt him let out a slow, shallow breath, as we heard the men move away from the closet.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a partner maybe,\u201d the cop continued. \u201cWhen are we interviewing the sister? She lives here, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was hysterical. Guess the two were real close.\u201d</p><p>I felt my brow furrow and Pike blinked at me. I shook my head and mouthed the word \u201cno\u201d as I had had the supreme displeasure of running into Emerson numerous times, but Nicolette only showed up this once.</p><p>\u201cMedics took her to City General. Hilburn went with her, but I don\u2019t think the girl has said anything yet.\u201d</p><p>Pike started breathing again as Moyer and Gibbs left the bedroom, their footsteps getting lighter as they walked toward the door. I felt my shoulders slump and for the first time noticed sweat beading along my hairline. We started to loosen ourselves from each other but stopped when we heard Gibbs addressing the unknown cop in the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the designer? The one who found her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the cop said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not really into fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs our murderer,\u201d Moyer retorted, exasperation evident. \u201cYou saw the shears, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard about the engraving. And she certainly had motive.\u201d</p><p>Pike looked down at me, his expression a combination of interest and suspicion. I did my best to meet his gaze with a menacing glare.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s number one on the suspect list,\u201d Moyer said.</p><p>\u201cHow do we feel about the photographer? I heard he and the vic used to date.\u201d</p><p>Even in the darkness, I could see the blush washing over Pike\u2019s face, could see the fear in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see why he\u2019d do Fairfield in,\u201d Moyer said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he offed the competition for his lady friend. She didn\u2019t appreciate it so he whacked her, too.\u201d</p><p>We heard Moyer cluck his tongue and then chuckle. \u201cInteresting theory. Remind me to make you my deputy.\u201d</p><p>Once the door clicked shut and the lock tumbled, Pike produced his pocket knife/rock-hard member again, silently slicing me out of the muslin. I left it in a heap in the depths of the closet, stepping over Emerson\u2019s collection of thick-soled sensible shoes.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re on fire and you\u2019re a murder suspect.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on my hips, the heat that was roiling in my panties moving to an angry flame in my gut. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I.\u201d</p><p>Pike took me in from head to toe, his eyes so sharp and hard it made my own body go on high alert. Finally he turned, leaving me behind as he went for the living room. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I believe you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure I believe you,\u201d I fumed. \u201cBesides, why would I kill Emerson? I would have beaten her in the competition anyway. And it\u2019s not like she was even\u2014hey.\u201d I clenched my hands, kicked my feet apart, and glared at Pike, who had turned to face me, slight interest on his face. \u201cI don\u2019t have to defend myself to you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThe guilty always overcompensate.\u201d He went back to work gathering his things.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, yanking on his shoulder until he faced me. \u201cThe guilty always act nonchalant. They always point the finger of accusation.\u201d</p><p>We both looked down at my index finger, extended, my hot-pink fingernail pressed up against Pike\u2019s chest, slice of red sticker across it. I quickly withdrew, crossing my arms in front of my chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about you, but going to jail for a crime I didn\u2019t commit is really not on my bucket list. So if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what? Hide out? Oh, no you\u2019re not. I\u2019ll tell them you were here.\u201d</p><p>Pike glared at me and cocked his head. \u201cYou were here, too.\u201d I blinked, realizing for the first time that I had just spent the last twenty minutes tied up and trapped in a closet by and with a possible murderer. A cold shiver washed over me and I squinted, trying to pick up the slightest twitch in Pike\u2019s eyes\u2014something that said he was hiding a secret, something that said he was guilty.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? You trying to read my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a short story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I kill Emerson?\u201d Pike huffed.</p><p>\u201cBecause she was your ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Pike opened the door. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t my ex-girlfriend and I hardly ever saw her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe that cop was right and you killed Reginald, too. For Emerson. Or maybe you wanted her to be your girlfriend, but she scorned you\u2014although I can\u2019t see Emerson scorning anyone, that whole beggars-can\u2019t-be-choosers thing, but whatever. That\u2019s it, huh? You loved her. It was one of those \u2018if-I-can\u2019t-have-her-then-nobody-can\u2019 things, huh?\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cNo, that\u2019s preposterous. Emerson was an awful person.\u201d A tiny niggle of guilt touched the back of my mind and I sighed. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t deserve to be shish-kabobed by a pair of designer shears.\u201d</p><p>A sympathetic look flashed over Pike\u2019s face. \u201cYou should go home, Nina. Lock your doors. Don\u2019t go anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Pike sighed, his chest rising mightily. \u201cI\u2019m going to go track a killer.\u201d</p><p>The air in the room seemed to drop twenty degrees once Pike slipped out. I stood in Emerson\u2019s empty living room, listening to the silence for a full minute before I took off like a shot down the hall, nearly pummeling Pike in the apartment vestibule.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hunt down a killer,\u201d I said, my voice sounding breathless and desperate. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it alone. You need backup.\u201d</p> <p>Pike paused, listening, and I moistened my suddenly dry lips. \u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>A hint of exhausted smile pushed at the corner of Pike\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd you\u2019re credible backup?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my teeth together, feeling the familiar push of my razor-sharp fangs. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>If this were a movie, our vestibule exchange would be followed by a musical montage of Pike and me with heads bent as we studied files and photo books over greasy takeout boxes of congealing Chinese food. The music would speed up as the scenes sped up to show the change of seasons, the stubble growing on Pike\u2019s chin as we grew more and more disillusioned. But this isn\u2019t a movie.</p><p>\u201cHow do we start?\u201d I said after what seemed like an hour had passed.</p><p>Pike rested a hand on my shoulder, his eyes intense as he looked directly at me. \u201cI meant what I said, Nina. Go upstairs. Lock your doors. Don\u2019t go anywhere alone.\u201d He spoke slowly, like a father explaining dating rules to his daughter and though I should have been offended and indignant, all I could muster up was a cold fist of fear gripping the bottom of my stomach. As Pike turned to go, I knew with every fiber of my being that he was about to fall into something grittier, dirtier, and far more dangerous than even he expected.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know why I couldn\u2019t feel the fire?\u201d I said to the back of his head.</p><p>He stopped, his hand on the door, back still toward me. I swallowed heavily when I saw his hand close over the door handle, the muscles at the back of his arms flicking as he went to push it open.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to know why you can\u2019t take my picture?\u201d</p><p>Pike stopped. His shoulders straightened and he turned to me, his face open, eyes soft. I saw a sliver of pink tongue dart out of his mouth, moistening his lips. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I took a step down, unsure of how\u2014or why\u2014I had bartered my biggest secret to find the murderer of a woman I couldn\u2019t stand and a man I barely knew.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs.\u201d</p><p>Vlad actually looked up from his laptop when Pike walked in. I felt my eyebrows rise and a sweet warmth spread in my stomach when Vlad\u2019s dark brows shot downward, his thin lips pulled into a menacing scowl as his eyes flickered over Pike.</p><p>Aw, Vlad. He cared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Pike said, looking from Vlad to me. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not company, he\u2019s my nephew.\u201d I crossed over to Vlad. \u201cVlad, this is my friend\u201d\u2014my breath caught on the word\u2014\u201cPike. Pike, my nephew, Vlad.\u201d</p><p>The two men regarded each other casually, critically, before offering each other one of those barely perceptible manly head nods.</p><p>Vlad went back to his screen and Pike followed me to the couch.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Pike said, sitting down beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big reveal?\u201d</p><p>I saw Vlad stiffen in his spot at the dining table. His eyebrows shot up over the screen, his eyes, wide and accusing, following. \u201cCan you come here for a second, Nina?\u201d</p><p>I beelined over to Vlad and leaned my head in, certain of what he was going to say. \u201cPlease tell me your big reveal entails your tits or your ass or something else that won\u2019t potentially ruin my life or make you have to eat Pike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing, Vlad,\u201d I hissed. And, because I felt like I should, I added, \u201cAnd watch your language.\u201d</p><p>Even though I had no idea what I was doing.</p><p>Pike edged to the side of the couch. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>A knock on the door stopped him and I celebrated my good luck. I snatched open the door and was greeted by Felipe\u2019s strangled cries, his shoulders shimmying under the dead weight of his emotion.</p><p>\u201cNina, Nina, oh, it\u2019s awful!\u201d He plunged himself into my arms and I was forced to hug him, to think of friend over fashion as a snot bubble popped on my dupioni silk blouse.</p><p>\u201cFelipe, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my Reggie,\u201d he huffed.</p><p>Pike and I shared a very d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu look. \u201cWhat about Reginald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t commit the suicide. He\u2014he\u2014he was murdered.\u201d The admittance came out with another rash of hysterical tears and Pike rushed over.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he was murdered?\u201d</p><p>I knew what I heard at the cocktail party, but Felipe\u2019s crushed face was painful confirmation.</p><p>\u201cI just came from the police station. They did the\u201d\u2014sniff\u2014\u201cthe\u201d\u2014sniff\u2014\u201cautopsy. It came back positive. Or whatever you say. My Reggie was murdered!\u201d</p><p>Pike snaked his arms in front of his chest. \u201cFirst Reginald and now Emerson,\u201d he said just under his breath. He shot me a sidelong glance and I knew exactly what he didn\u2019t say: that I was next.</p><p>We spent the next twenty minutes listening as Felipe filled us in on what the police had told him\u2014which wasn\u2019t much. By the time he left the sun was dipping into the Hudson and I was pacing. Pike grabbed both my shoulders and I stopped my march.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? There is a murderer on the loose. And you and I both know who\u2019s next on his list. Me.\u201d Being mainly immortal I wasn\u2019t all that nervous. But still, getting stabbed or hung would be nothing short of an enormous pain in my ass, not to mention the havoc it would wreak on my wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what you should be most concerned about,\u201d Pike said.</p><p>I raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cSuspect.\u201d Pike mouthed the word.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s just a theory. And a flimsy one at that. You have more motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, Emerson and I barely spoke. The whole boyfriend-girlfriend thing was completely in her head. Emerson and Reginald were both your competitors. With both of them gone, you\u2019ve technically won the competition. That\u2019s your motive.\u201d</p><p>I yanked my shoulders away from Pike and gaped. \u201cAre you seriously accusing me of killing off my competition? I\u2019ll have you know that I would have whipped their asses fair and square. God rest their souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not accusing you. I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t think it\u2019s me. They think it\u2019s you.\u201d Pike rolled his eyes and I dropped my voice. \u201cOr me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you know about Emerson? You said you used to run into her all the time. I know you two weren\u2019t friends but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what? I knew nothing about her other than what I told you. I didn\u2019t even know she had a sister for God\u2019s sake until she showed up in my face.\u201d I paused. \u201cThat\u2019s it. The sister. We need to talk to her.\u201d I bit my bottom lip. \u201cBut she probably wouldn\u2019t talk to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she was apparently so hysterical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she might think that one of us killed Emerson.\u201d</p><p>Pike pinned me with a stare and I sighed, dropping my head in my hands. \u201cI will be the hysterical one if I have to go to prison. They make everyone shower together. And you have to wear those stupid plastic shoes!\u201d I frowned, my eyes skittering over the apartment and seeing bars, one of those ugly metal toilets, and a thin cot with four-thread-count sheets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then I saw Vlad.</p><p>Slowly, his eyes came up from behind the screen. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I felt a smile playing at the edge of my lips. \u201cShe\u2019ll talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pike asked.</p><p>I stopped, excitement building in my chest. \u201cShe\u2019ll talk to Vlad. He\u2019s young, he\u2019s charming,\u201d I said and glanced at Pike. \u201cHe\u2019s not you. She\u2019ll open up to him.\u201d</p><p>Pike looked over at Vlad and then back at me. \u201cNo offense to your nephew, but do you really think a girl who just lost her sister to murder is going to suddenly go all boy crazy for him?\u201d He jerked a thumb toward Vlad, and threw in a, \u201cNo offense, bro,\u201d for good measure.</p><p>\u201cWell, Vlad\u2019s got\u2014\u201d I paused, biting my tongue before I said the word glamours. A glamour is almost like a vampire pheromone; it attracts humans to us like bees to honey and once they find us . . . well, humans tend to become utterly entranced and allow us to eat them. Usually.</p><p>If you don\u2019t adhere to UDA guidelines.</p> <p>Glamours are strictly forbidden according to the UDA-V charter but I am almost completely sure that a glamour for solving a homicide was a way lesser charge than a glamour for committing a homicide. And either way, I\u2019d rather be beheaded by the UDA than spend eternity in a prison cell and an orange jumpsuit.</p><p>\u201cI mean Vlad\u2019s got charm.\u201d I turned toward him and threw on my best version of adorably irresistible Disney eyes. \u201cPlease, Vlad. For me?\u201d</p><p>Vlad looked up, eyed me warily. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I crossed the room in two short strides and batted my lashes again. \u201cPweeze?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>I tossed a quick glance over my shoulder, then laid my palm flat on the table, a quarter-inch from Vlad\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I said, my voice low and dripping with heat. \u201cI made you, Louis.\u201d Vlad didn\u2019t regard me visually, but I could see a stiffness run through his spine as I regarded him by his real, pre-vamp, pre-Count-Chocula-obsession name. \u201cAnd I will be the first one to take you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t. UDA bylaw.\u201d There was an edge of teenage smugness in his words that made me want to kill him just a little bit more.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, crossing my arms in front of my chest. \u201cI won\u2019t kill you.\u201d I snatched my cell phone from where it rested on the counter. \u201cBut Kale will.\u201d</p><p>Vlad stood up so quickly his chair thunked to the ground behind him. \u201cFine!\u201d he said, terror cutting through his eyes. \u201cJust please,\u201d he continued, holding up both hands as if the phone were about to spit bullets. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t call Kale. Please.\u201d</p><p>Now I was smug.</p><p>Pike looped an arm over the back of the couch as he turned to stare at us. \u201cWho\u2019s this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Vlad and I said in unison.</p><p>I pushed Vlad toward the door. \u201cCome on. Just go over there. Ask her for coffee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good about this,\u201d Vlad said, pulling on his collar.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a good thing,\u201d I said, patting him lightly on the shoulder. \u201cYou saw the way Nicolette lit up when you introduced yourself.\u201d</p><p>Vlad glared down at me and Pike piped in, \u201cBesides, it\u2019s just coffee.\u201d His grin was wide and genuine and I melted just a tiny bit, barely even registering the fact that he could very well be a homicidal maniac.</p><p>I had Vlad in a vice grip and the doorknob in my hand when Pike grabbed my shoulder, his hand warm and heavy. \u201cWait,\u201d he said, \u201cdo we have some kind of plan?\u201d</p><p>I whirled. \u201cOf course we do. Vlad goes out with Nicolette, asks some questions, gains some intel about whether or not Emerson has some horrid, murderous people in her immediate past\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vlad opened his mouth and I shot him a very loving but very deathly gaze.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he relays it back to us. We find said murderous people and voila! Off the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds awfully simple,\u201d Pike said skeptically.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be,\u201d Vlad answered.</p><p>Pike and I sat in an uncomfortable silence while Vlad left the apartment. When an acceptable amount of time had passed\u2014about thirty seconds\u2014I sprinted toward the front door and pushed my nose through the crack that Vlad had left open. He was in the hallway and had just knocked on Nicolette\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Pike came up behind me, his chest pressing up against my back, his hands resting on my hips. I wanted to grind into him, to toss him to the couch, to experience something other than this constant edginess and suspicion.</p><p>But Nicolette opened the door.</p><p>She was red-eyed and pink-nosed, her hair pulled back in a sloppy ponytail. She immediately straightened up when she saw who her caller was.</p><p>I felt Pike lean closer to me, his lips a hairsbreadth from my ear as he leaned down, his breath warm against the marble cold of my neck. \u201cDamn. She asked him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good sign, though.\u201d I tiptoed\u2014sheerly for effect\u2014weightless, remember?\u2014across the hall and pressed my ear lightly to Nicolette and Emerson\u2019s apartment door.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asking her to coffee,\u201d I whispered over my shoulder. \u201cShe said \u2018okay, how about in five minutes.\u2019 Oh, crap.\u201d I ran back across the hall, smacking chest-to-warm-carved chest into Pike and may or may not have held the stance for a longer-than-appropriate moment. I felt Pike\u2019s arms go around me, his palm on the small of my back. Then Vlad pressed through the door and we sprang apart like a negative charge. Pike\u2019s cheeks were flushed and there was a light sheen of sweat above his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you two doing?\u201d Vlad asked without hiding the suspicious disgust from his face.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you. What happened?\u201d</p><p>Vlad patted his well-shellacked hair. \u201cWe\u2019re going for coffee. Just like he asked.\u201d He pretend-breathed on me. \u201cHow\u2019s my breath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d I said. \u201cHave fun. And don\u2019t forget, you tell us everything. And really dig, you know? Pry.\u201d</p><p>Vlad rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>He made sure to slam the door when he left.</p><p>I waited for a beat, worrying my bottom lip. Finally, I grabbed my keys, straightened my ponytail, and gave Pike the universal sign for \u201ccome on, get off my couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOn a date with my nephew.\u201d</p><p>Pike and I were tucked against a back wall at a tiny round coffee table barely big enough for our elbows, let alone our drinks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want anything? Coffee? Frap-mocha-liscious or however the hell they bastardized coffee?\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips together and shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d I tapped my ever-present travel mug. \u201cI\u2019ve had about all the coffee I could take for the day.\u201d</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t a total lie. The blood bad that I had for breakfast had a distinct, burnt coffee flavor. Made my teeth curl just thinking about it.</p><p>Pike had his elbows on the table, chin in hand. \u201cWhat kind of woman comes to a coffeehouse and doesn\u2019t at least order a coffee? Or . . .\u201d He pulled a chipped white plate toward him and snatched the muffin from it, his bite leaving less than half the muffin. \u201cA sweet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind of girl who is on a stakeout.\u201d I nudged my chair a half-inch farther away. \u201cCan you try to keep most of that in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Pike shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t even hear what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>Vlad and Nicolette were seated half the shop away from us, Nicolette\u2019s light waves falling over the back of her chair while Vlad smiled kindly and nodded, all the while shooting dagger glances at us whenever Nicolette looked away.</p><p>\u201cNicolette is talking about Emerson. She ate a cookie\u2014snickerdoodle, I think\u2014and is now talking about Christmas Eve at her parents\u2019 house. Apparently, Emerson got an Easy-Bake Oven while Nicolette got the Barbie Design Studio.\u201d</p><p>Pike leaned back in his chair, clearly impressed. \u201cYou can hear that?\u201d</p><p>Heat zinged through me and I felt color\u2014whoever\u2019s it was\u2014washing over my cheeks. \u201cI have really, really good hearing. And I read lips. It runs in the family.\u201d I kept my eyes focused on Vlad but I knew that Pike was staring at me. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>A good forty minutes had passed and Nicolette told Vlad about being on the cheerleading squad and her college career. Vlad looked adequately forlorn and heartbroken as he mentioned his \u201cex-girlfriend\u201d and how he came out to New York to mend his broken heart. I was about to gag, Pike was about to drop dead of boredom, and we were no closer to learning anything about Emerson\u2019s private life.</p><p>\u201cOkay, either something happens or I\u2019m going to stab someone through the heart.\u201d</p><p>My throat tightened and my blood froze statue-still. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Pike held up his hands. \u201cSorry\u2014too soon? Too soon.\u201d</p><p>I felt my mouth drop open then slammed it shut again, certain that Pike was talking about stabbing in general\u2014not staking a vampire through the heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And I don\u2019t know if that made me feel better or worse.</p><p>\u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Pike let out a long sigh and leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head. The motion caused his semifitted black tee to rise just the smallest bit\u2014just enough to expose a thin, two-inch trail of jet black hair leading from his very kissable belly button and disappearing into the gathered elastic of his boxer shorts. I licked my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>I did my best to tear my eyes from that happy trail, to tear my mind from what lay beneath.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your family.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing will pull you out of a fantasy like an incredibly sexy man asking you to talk about your family.</p><p>\u201cNot much to tell,\u201d I said simply. \u201cMom, dad, sister, two brothers.\u201d I shrugged toward Vlad. \u201cAnd Vlad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of name is Vlad? I assumed you were French.\u201d</p><p>I felt my beaming grin go from ear to ear. I loved it when a man recognized my elegant French upbringing\u2014especially now, more than a century and a half after the fact. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. French or Spanish\u2014\u2018La\u2019 Shay.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Well, he was pretty enough to be a little bit dumb.</p> <p>\u201cMy sister married a Hungarian,\u201d I lied. \u201cVlad is a pretty common Hungarian name.\u201d</p><p>Pike\u2019s brows went up. \u201cInteresting. I thought it was Russian.\u201d</p><p>It was storybook vampire clich\u00e9! I wanted to scream. Which was why Louis LaShay chose to adopt the annoying Dracula moniker later in his non-creative vampire life.</p><p>\u201cLook, Vlad and Nicolette are on a date.\u201d I snaked a tongue over my bottom lip, my number one tip in my arsenal of man-without-pants-prep. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we stop talking family and start talking fantasy?\u201d</p><p>A single eyebrow rose over Pike\u2019s dark eyes and his lips quirked into a smile that stood halfway between innocently interested and sex god with a naughty spot. \u201cFantasy, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly, resting my chin on my hands, letting a flow of my dark hair spill over my shoulder. If I had a whipped-cream topped coffee\u2014if I could stomach such a thing\u2014I would trail an index finger through it. Instead I leaned just a touch closer to Pike, letting my long hair tickle his arm.</p><p>The temperature in the coffeehouse rose by ten degrees.</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d He let his voice trail off in that half-gravelly, all-sexy way, his eyes cutting from mine to wash all over my body with an appreciative grin. \u201cVlad wants you.\u201d</p> <p>I squelched a snarl. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. We\u2019re French nobles! Not Alabama hillbillies! You\u2019re into some sick\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pike rolled his eyes and pointed. \u201cNo, Vlad, for real, wants you.\u201d</p><p>I whipped my head toward where he pointed and this time, didn\u2019t bother toning down the snarl. Vlad stood up and walked toward the restroom; I followed at a furious pace.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? Don\u2019t you know I was\u2014\u201d I paused, cleared my throat, and straightened. \u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve called this little summit because you found out something good.\u201d</p><p>Vlad shrugged, all unaffected teen. \u201cSorry I interrupted your attempt at a fang bang, but this is going nowhere. All Nicolette wants to talk about is Christmas in Norman Rockwell-ville and her stupid Barbie Design Studio.\u201d</p><p>I arched a brow. \u201cBarbie Design Studio?\u201d</p><p>Vlad shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Apparently Emerson got the Easy-Bake Oven. Look, I\u2019ll give her five more minutes and then I\u2019m taking her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive more minutes?\u201d</p><p>Vlad whipped out his iPhone. \u201cAnd this time counts.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes\u2014to the millisecond\u2014later, Vlad was tossing a few crumpled bills on the table and opening the door for Nicolette.</p><p>I groaned. \u201cSo, that was a waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know . . . we never got to talk about your fantasy . . . or your fears.\u201d</p><p>I was drained, cranky, and the sickly sweet smell of pastries going day old was making my stomach churn. As sexy as Pike was, the borrowed blood running through my veins was almost gone and all I wanted was an US Weekly and a vat of O Neg. \u201cMaybe another time.\u201d</p><p>Pike sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cThere is something we haven\u2019t tried.\u201d</p><p>I was waiting for him to say sex. Or kissing. And I was cursing myself for wasting all that good blood when it could have been rushing to my\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe need to look at the bodies.\u201d</p><p>Never mind.</p><p>\u201cLook at the bodies? What for?\u201d I wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cAnything. Signs of struggle, bruises, cuts\u2014something the police may have missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t have a whole load of faith in breathers but I figure the cops\u2014and the coroner, or medical examiner\u2014would probably have found, photographed, or scraped off anything of evidentiary importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say breather?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse and stood up quickly. \u201cSure, breather. It\u2019s what everyone calls the cops in San Francisco. You know . . .\u201d My mind raced. \u201cThey \u2018breathe\u2019 justice?\u201d I turned on my heel. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>I felt Pike\u2019s hand close over my forearm and the strong warmth sent a shiver of gooseflesh all over my body. He pulled me closer and my breath caught in my throat, the tight anticipation all at once amazing and uncomfortable. His lips brushed over the part in my hair, then barely touched my earlobe. \u201cMeet me tonight.\u201d</p><p>My body felt like warm Jell-O as his command oozed through me. I swallowed, batting my eyelashes in that slow, bedroomy way that Elizabeth Taylor created and I mastered. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morgue.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s official: I\u2019ve been living with Sophie Lawson for way too long.</p><p>It\u2019s never dark in the city. It\u2019s also never without a population or a pulse, which was why I was wearing a form-fitting black Shoshanna Lonstein dress (I forgive her for the Seinfeld marriage debacle; we can\u2019t always avoid the starter husband) with six-inch platform heels in blazing blue for my evening sojourn to the morgue. Besides the fact that I would never be caught dead (again) in anything velour or with a drawstring, the ensemble was a perfect cover: New Yorkers might mistake me for a socialite or a supermodel, but a morgue burglar? Not a chance.</p><p>Pike looked me up and down and despite that fact that our upcoming \u201cdate\u201d revolved around the officially dead, his appraising grin shot a little zing down my spine. \u201cWell you look like you\u2019re ready to catch a killer.\u201d</p><p>Vlad crossed the living room, gave me a once over, and muttered, \u201cOr hepatitis.\u201d</p><p>The Lower Manhattan City Morgue sits like a fat, ugly beehive among other government-owned fat, ugly beehive buildings.</p><p>I suppose there isn\u2019t a lot of support of a morgue makeover.</p><p>It was easy enough to slip inside and easier still to scurry around unbidden\u2014vampires have no scent, nor any discernible weight, which means no footsteps, no creaky floors to give us away. And also the man at the front desk was asleep.</p><p>I waved Pike through and we scurried down the dimly lit hall.</p><p>\u201cOkay, stay out here and stand guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going in. You stand guard.\u201d</p><p>Pike sighed. \u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Pike, my roommate is basically a private investigator who is dating a detective. I have inadvertently been on more stakeouts, snuck through more morgues, and flopped around with more dead bodies than all the NYPD put together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m kind of aroused right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d I yanked open the storage-room door. \u201cStand guard.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I was pleased to see the bodies were stored in an orderly fashion (did I mention we vamps are a little bit OCD?). I was able to find Reginald and stretch him out on one of the exam tables in record time, gingerly placing a file folder over his flash-frozen man bits\u2014I could only investigate so many things at once. I checked out the red-purple bruises circling his neck\u2014not entirely certain what I was looking for\u2014and was walking my fingers toward a tiny red pinprick behind his left ear. \u201cInteresting,\u201d I whispered to my dead audience. The pinprick was minuscule and could have been a broken blood vessel or a mole for all I knew, but I knew how to find out. I pulled Reginald\u2019s file and did a quick scan. The bruises were listed, as well as a hernia scar, a hair weave, and a little tattoo on Reginald\u2019s derriere. There was no mention of the pinprick.</p><p>I left Reginald laid out and went to find Emerson. She wasn\u2019t listed on any of the drawers and I gulped, staring at the heavy metal door for the \u201coverflow\u201d body storage. There are very few things that give me the heebie-jeebies, but walking into a room where the dead are laid out and stacked like bakery goods made my stomach lurch\u2014and not in a good way. I sucked in a nerve-steadying breath and stepped into the walk-in freezer, jamming a Gross Anatomy book in the doorway. I had seen one too many television shows where the main characters get locked in a walk-in and end up freezing to death or eating their weight in ice cream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All my bases covered, I went to work examining the paperwork stacked on each body. I was so engrossed\u2014or so desperate to get Emerson and get out of there\u2014that I didn\u2019t hear someone slyly removing the Gross Anatomy book. What I did hear was the heavy metal thunk of the door closing.</p><p>My heart locked in my throat, but I refused to let myself panic. I casually walked up to the door, certain that the giant refrigerator people had seen all the locked-in-the-freezer episodes as well, and had created some sort of snazzy trapdoor or inside lock pop.</p><p>Apparently, refrigerator people are not TV watchers.</p> <p>I dug into my cleavage and yanked out my cell phone. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure whom I\u2019d call to rescue me from a walk-in freezer filled with people-sicles, but Vlad was usually good for the occasional rescue. I wrapped my arms around myself and hit the speed-dial button.</p><p>And nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cNo bars!\u201d I groaned. I started to pace, staring down at my screen. Closer to the back of the fridge a few cheery bars popped up. If I held the phone above my head, I got another half. Still not enough to support a phone call.</p><p>I pressed myself as far back as I could, then eyed the stackable body shelves. If I could just get a little higher . . . I tentatively poked a foot on the edge of the lowermost platform, careful not to get anybody on my shoe. I took a step up. And then another. And then I grinned down at my phone when it decided it could make a call.</p><p>And then I heard the weird, scraping sound of the undead coming back to life. My hackles went up, hot adrenaline sparking through me.</p> <p>I jumped from the cart and launched it backward. I would like to say I barrel-rolled or did something equally as theatrical but what I did was sail through the air, arms outstretched, fingers clawed and desperate for something to hold on to. When I landed on the cement floor, I had the slick, cold plastic of body bags in each hand, the contents of each bag\u2014and several others\u2014pummeling me from above.</p><p>I howled.</p><p>I don\u2019t think my feet hit the ground as I jumped, and tossed my body into the door, screaming bloody murder.</p><p>\u201cPike! PIKE! Get me out of here! Get me the fuck out of here! I\u2019m stuck!\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take eons for Pike to hear me and loosen the door. When he did I ran out, circling the autopsy tables, relishing the way the room-temperature air burned at my frozen skin.</p><p>I felt Pike\u2019s eyes on me, curious, as I rubbed my arms and let the adrenaline drain from my body. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d I finally hissed, eyes narrowed.</p> <p>\u201cI was outside. Standing guard. Just like you told me to be.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t fault him for doing as I\u2019d told him, but I wanted to. \u201cWhy did you come in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were taking forever, I had to pee, and then I heard you huffing and thumping. I thought maybe you were getting a little frisky with ol\u2019 Reg there.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and I recoiled, disgusted. \u201cYou\u2019re a big ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a big ol\u2019 side of beef locking yourself in the deep freeze. Did you find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t lock myself in the freezer. I shoved a book in the doorway so I wouldn\u2019t get stuck.\u201d</p><p>Pike made a show of looking all around for a book.</p><p>\u201cSomeone filched the book and shut the door on me.\u201d</p> <p>Pike raised his eyebrows, though he didn\u2019t look the least bit convinced. \u201cIs that so? Because I\u2019ve been waiting out there,\u201d he said, jerking a thumb toward the hall. \u201cAnd I happen to know for a fact that no one came in here.\u201d</p><p>I gaped. \u201cAre you calling me a liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I might be calling you a little bit embarrassed because you locked yourself in the fridge, but definitely not a liar.\u201d</p><p>The chill from the fridge had distinctly worn off and rage burned through me. Before I could open my eyes\u2014or my fang-filled mouth\u2014Pike was checking the bodies piled in the fridge. \u201cHere\u2019s our friend Emerson.\u201d</p><p>He laid her out on the slab and unzipped her. I was surprised when a stab of emotion shot through me\u2014I\u2019m not sure if it was seeing Emerson laid out this way, or seeing Nicolette red-eyed and torn up over the death of her sister. Either way, the body was just a shell\u2014I knew that better than anyone. But there was something pulling me.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we looking for?\u201d</p><p>I hugged my arms across my chest. \u201cLook behind her left ear.\u201d</p><p>Pike did as he was told and I watched his finger slide over Emerson\u2019s marble-still flesh. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>I peered, and pointed. \u201cSee that tiny hole? Needle prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeedle prick? What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReginald has one, too. Same place. It means that neither Reg nor Emerson died the way we thought they did.\u201d</p><p>Pike was fingering Emerson\u2019s chart and I could see his lips move as he read. That should have been enough for me to shake him off but there was something charming and sweet about the way his lips moved, little bursts of breath puffing at every other word. \u201cWell, that\u2019s something they didn\u2019t say in the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrain cleaner.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found drain cleaner in both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone inject\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would cause pain, an arrhythmia at best, death at worst.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back. \u201cDo I want to know how you know that?\u201d</p><p>Pike snapped the file shut and got to work putting Reginald and Emerson back. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>We were able to sneak right back out of the morgue\u2014a happy coincidence for us, an unsettling lack in homeland security for the rest of the country. But, I supposed, as I brushed my dress back down over my thighs, maybe terrorists going on body raids wasn\u2019t exactly at threat level red.</p><p>It was one of those nights where everything about the city hummed and moved, but the city itself stayed impossibly still. The air didn\u2019t move and the moon hung in the sky, as pale and anemic as everything else that wilted in the heat.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said as we walked, \u201ctwo people are injected with drain cleaner, then made to look like they\u2019ve either committed suicide or been murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Pike slurped the last bit of the purple ICEE he made us stop for through his straw. \u201cFirst one looked like suicide, second one looked like a murder caused by you.\u201d He grinned, his teeth tinged purple.</p><p>\u201cThanks for pointing that out, Colombo.\u201d I frowned. \u201cAnd we have nothing in the way of leads, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther than you trying to kill off the competition, no.\u201d</p><p>I spun, my finger a quarter-inch from his nose. \u201cWhat did I say? Look at me.\u201d I jumped back, gave him a good chance to take in my self-styled ensemble. \u201cI would have won that competition fair and square. Someone is out to get me.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Pike was face to face with me and I could feel his hot breath breaking over my cheeks. \u201cThen why hasn\u2019t he gotten you yet?\u201d</p><p>Anger bubbled in my veins. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d His eyes flashed.</p><p>I broke his gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you anything.\u201d I tried to turn away but his hand was around my arm, clamping down. His warmth shot through my whole body and I remembered things. . . .</p><p>Another ink-black night where everything hung still and quiet in the oppressing heat. A rustle in the bushes and I was on the window sill, tucking my petticoats between my legs . . . I felt the air cut open when I dropped, my boots hitting the soft earth below my window. And he was there. He was just a shadow then but he was there\u2014I didn\u2019t need to see him to feel him over every inch of my body, to feel the air sizzle with his vibrant electricity. His fingertips brushed my arm and they were ice cold but sent fire-hot prickles and every synapse firing\u2014and then he closed the distance between us and his lips were on mine. Wanting, tasting. And I was young and I was thirsty and I had never felt this way before . . . then his lips left mine and trailed slowly, with feather-light kisses over my jaw and down my neck. I felt my pulse throb and his tongue circled it. My heart pounded and my head was filled. There was fire roaring through me and it was at my neck. I heard the pierce before I felt it. My virgin skin popped and his teeth sunk in. And when I closed my eyes, everything was dripping in the most vibrant shade of red. . . .</p><p>\u201cPike.\u201d I was breathing hard and trying to push the word past my teeth. Pike had me now, tonight, in this city, and I could feel his fingers pressing at the small of my back as I crushed against him, his hand cupping my chin, my cheek. The city cracked and came alive and I was distinctly aware of every horn honking, every New Yorker talking, yelling, laughing. Waves crashed. The world crashed when Pike\u2019s lips covered mine. I tried to pull back but his fingers dug into me and my entire body was exploding with things I hadn\u2019t felt since that last night, since that last moment when my own blood shot through my veins.</p><p>I could feel.</p><p>My entire body was on high alert and I felt the hot softness of Pike\u2019s wet lips. I felt his tongue nudge my mouth open and I could taste him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And somewhere, there was blood.</p><p>Too close.</p><p>My eyes were on the vein throbbing on Pike\u2019s neck.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, pulling back, pushing against his chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Pike pulled me back to him and I felt the word on my earlobe as his mouth opened and he nibbled.</p><p>My body throbbed. My need deepened. I pushed away\u2014tore myself away\u2014from Pike and stumbled backward and then started to run.</p><p>\u201cI know what you are.\u201d Pike\u2019s words tumbled out and hit every wall of the dismal little alley.</p><p>I stopped, turned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>He took a slow step forward, his eyes still hard, pinning me. \u201cI know what you are, Nina.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips and all the energy, the heat that had surged through my body, was gone. I was hollow again, and cold. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think you know about me.\u201d</p><p>Pike licked his lips, bee-stung and red from our kiss. \u201cYou\u2019re a vampire.\u201d</p><p>I turned my back and left Pike standing alone in the alleyway.</p><p>I walked the rest of the way home and Pike didn\u2019t follow. I kept my thoughts focused on the murders so I wouldn\u2019t hear his voice reverberate through my head. A vampire. I knew it, I flaunted it\u2014in the Underworld, natch\u2014but hearing the word come out of his mouth . . .</p><p>I sunk my key into the lock and shoved into the apartment vestibule. The overhead light was buzzing and swinging lightly, illuminating the squarish, brown-paper-wrapped package on top of my mail slot. The sender had used a whole spool of tape and twine and addressed the thing simply to \u201cLaShay.\u201d I shoved it under my arm and carried it to my apartment.</p> <p>\u201cHey, where\u2019ve you been?\u201d Vlad wrinkled his nose. \u201cYou smell like morgue.\u201d</p><p>I flopped down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPike knows.\u201d</p><p>Vlad finished his blood bag with a mighty suck and pushed himself up to a sitting position. \u201cPike knows who the murderer is? That\u2019s good because all this death and dying is really ruining my vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I blinked, staring straight ahead. \u201cPike knows about me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to fill him in; the knowing flashed across Vlad\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe knows you\u2019re a vampire? Does he know I am?\u201d</p><p>I swung my head. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo we have a murderer on the loose, a guy who knows you\u2019re a card-carrying member of the undead. . . . How did he find out? And, he\u2019s not going to go all Van Helsing on us, is he? Because we\u2019d need special approval from the UDA to take him out and you know who handles that paperwork, right? Kale. She\u2019d never approve me. Hell, she\u2019d call Pike and leave a trail of breadcrumbs or Hostess CupCakes right to me.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he knows. He just\u2014he just said it. \u2018I know what you are.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Vlad crushed his blood bag and tossed it onto the coffee table. \u201cOminous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVlad, what am I supposed to do about this? A breather knows about me.\u201d</p><p>Vlad shrugged, finding the remote control and aiming at the TV. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Kill him, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Something washed over me and it took me a good minute to realize that it was pain. I didn\u2019t want to kill Pike. I didn\u2019t want to be what I was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I need some air.\u201d</p><p>Something was welling inside me, pressing against my chest and making my eyes sting by the time I crested the steps down to the apartment vestibule.</p><p>And then everything changed.</p><p>Two of the ancient windows were cracked open; I could see there was a gentle breeze outside but the air in the vestibule itself was staid and heavy but crackled with a weird, electric energy. I sniffed. The metallic scent was sharp and distinctive and my whole body went on high alert\u2014my fangs sharpening and elongating, saliva rushing toward my tongue.</p><p>There was blood in the air.</p><p>It stank of injury and heat with just the slightest tinge of something fresh. I took a step. The energy-filled trail stopped dead on the bottom floor landing and so did I, spinning slowly in the darkness, and finally cussing at myself for being a scared little girl. And then I heard the whimper.</p><p>It was soft, barely a breath, but there was something in the single syllable that was anguished. I stiffened.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>There was a breath of pregnant silence and then two ragged, heavy breaths. \u201cHelp?\u201d</p><p>I turned toward the voice. \u201cWhere are you? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The word tore at my gut and I felt my human side taking over\u2014someone in pain, in anguish\u2014someone reaching out. Because she doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m a monster.</p><p>I swept the thought out of my mind as quickly as it came and closed my eyes, concentrating on the breathing. Ragged breath in, ragged breath out. I took a step. Ragged breath\u2014and suddenly the vestibule was heavy with the sweet metallic stench of blood. A drip of saliva rolled down my throat.</p><p>\u201cTell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said, \u201cBy the stairs. I\u2014I don\u2019t think I can move.\u201d</p><p>I crept along the stairwell and banister. The blood scent grew stronger each step the light grew darker. I was swallowing furiously, trying not to think about how delicate the scent was, how delicious. The way it felt when fangs punctured flesh\u2014warm, soft\u2014like berries popping, flooding your mouth with delicious, rich juice.</p><p>My heart thudded and my stomach lurched, growled. I was ready to flee, to run back upstairs and lock myself in my apartment but then\u2014</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d</p><p>Nicolette lay in a heap on the floor, her body impossibly bent, her face fragile and pale. Her thick, cracked lips trembled and moisture surrounded her milky eyes. \u201cPlease help me.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and bent down to her, bending my head from the heady smell of fresh blood. I watched my own hand reach out, shakily touch Nicolette on the shoulder, my fingers barely grazing the girl\u2019s torn flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d It was my voice, but I wasn\u2019t sure that I had spoken.</p><p>\u201cSomeone attacked me,\u201d Nicolette said, her voice a low whisper. \u201cIs he gone?\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder and rose to my full height. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure.\u201d</p><p>I knew that her attacker wasn\u2019t there. I could smell every scent in the vestibule\u2014layers upon layers of Clorox and urine, the cloying, salty smell of humanity coming through day after day and hour after hour\u2014and the sinful, beckoning scent of Nicolette\u2019s fresh blood.</p><p>I pushed open the double doors and bent my head out, sucking in lungfuls of night air. Soon I was coughing\u2014and crying. I wanted to help her. I wanted to taste her.</p><p>\u201cIs he gone?\u201d</p><p>I could hear Nicolette shifting on the floor and I sprang toward her, my arms reaching out, doing my best to gingerly touch her clothes, the banister, anything that wasn\u2019t soaked in her blood.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Nicolette stood now and shakily came out of the darkness. I sucked in a breath.</p><p>Her long blond hair was matted, knotted with blood that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. One eye was already blooming with purple bruises and angry red scratches, her lashes disappearing in the swell. Tears rolled down her cheeks and her flesh showed underneath\u2014a pink and delicate contrast to the smudged dirt and dried blood everywhere else.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d</p><p>Nicolette lurched toward me and crumpled in my arms. I stiffened, feeling the sticky warmth of her blood on my skin and when she started to cry\u2014great, hiccupping sobs\u2014I was able to hold her against me and hold my breath. When it got to be too much I chanced a tiny breath, my nose a quarter-inch above a gash that crossed the side of Nicolette\u2019s head. I recoiled just slightly, an antiseptic stench coming from her unbroken skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>I went to reach for my phone but Nicolette\u2019s arm shot out, her hand grabbing my wrist, her grip surprisingly strong. \u201cNo, please don\u2019t, Nina. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>I patted Nicolette\u2019s shoulder awkwardly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie. Everything will be okay.\u201d I had no idea whether or not it would be\u2014and betted toward the latter when I realized I had left my phone in the apartment. \u201cI\u2019m just going to use the emergency line down here, okay? I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I gingerly began to extricate myself from Nicolette. She whimpered lightly but shifted her weight away from me and I scurried across the tile. My hand was wrapped around the telephone receiver when I heard Nicolette\u2019s bones cracking as she stood. At the same second I turned, something heavy smashed across the side of my head. I felt my skin pucker and gash, felt the crush of my browbone and nose. The sheer force knocked me backward and I heard the clatter of the telephone receiver as it fell to the ground; I felt the cool glass of the door as I slumped against it. A horrid clanging sound reverberated through my skull. There was screaming and\u2014squawking?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure which one\u2014if either\u2014that I was doing so I worked to pull my eyes open. I needed to protect Nicolette\u2014frail, battered Nicolette. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicolette, who was vaulting directly toward me, absolute hate in her eyes, knuckles burning white as she gripped a length of metal pipe.</p><p>\u201cNicolette?\u201d</p><p>She bared her teeth and let out the most heinous banshee-like scream I\u2019d ever heard. My hands went up instinctively and I grabbed the pipe as it sliced through the air toward me. She was basically growling now, teeth clenched, chin shiny with saliva. I held the pipe but Nicolette was surprisingly strong. She lurched and caught me square in the gut with the sole of her foot; I crashed through the glass door, shards catching the moonlight and dancing like little stars. My shoulder blades slapped against the concrete and Nicolette wasted no time, dropping the pipe and clawing at my neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing is wrong with me!\u201d she spat. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you fucking die? You were on fire\u2014and frozen\u2014and now\u2014die!\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to me again and I squirmed. She grabbed a fistful of my hair and yanked until I heard strands breaking. She pulled her arm back to show me my own hair, no longer attached to my scalp. Her grin was wide and terrifyingly maniacal.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d</p><p>Wallop me with a metal pipe, sure. Try and choke me? Whatever. Mess with my hair? I will seriously end you.</p><p>I felt my sharpening fangs and unholy rage roar through me. I was about to lunge\u2014and finish\u2014Nicolette when a shriek cut through the night and my winged nemesis dive-bombed. I was sure he was some sort of beaked bastion of hell answering Nicolette\u2019s beckon until he skidded over her forehead, talons extending, cutting wide gashes across her cheeks and nose.</p> <p>She recoiled and swatted at the thing but it was gone instantly. I used the distraction to buck Nicolette off of me, and suddenly Pike was there and he was gripping her, dragging her away from me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crazy!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d Nicolette\u2019s eyes were on fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Pike yelled, still holding Nicolette back.</p><p>\u201cShe attacked me!\u201d We were both pointing fingers, but I was gaping.</p><p>I paused and stared at Pike. \u201cWait, where the hell did you come from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKill her!\u201d Nicolette screamed. \u201cShe\u2019s a thief just like my damn sister!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the designer,\u201d she spat. \u201cNot you, not Emerson, or Fairfield. Me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you got the Barbie Design Studio,\u201d Pike said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Emerson stole it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you killed her?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Rage roiled through Nicolette\u2019s body. \u201cShe stole everything!\u201d</p><p>Nicolette\u2019s screams were drowned out by the wailing of sirens and before she could finish her psychotic reasoning, police officers and paramedics were flooding out of their cars and rushing toward us.</p> <p>Moyer was one of them. He jutted his chin toward Pike. \u201cYou sure about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe admitted it.\u201d</p><p>Hopkins raced in with a pair of cuffs and Nicolette was subdued and led away, though she was still squirming and screaming, doing her best to kick and bite poor Hopkins.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d Pike touched my arm gently.</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014oh, God, the drain cleaner. I smelled it all over her but I didn\u2019t put two and two together.\u201d</p><p>A sad smile played at the edges of his lips. \u201cWhy would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you obviously put something together or did you just happen to\u2014\u201d I happened to glance down at Pike\u2019s hand, still soft on my arm. His fingernails were tinged with the slightest bit of deep red. I narrowed my eyes, unease flooding my body. \u201cYou know what I am because of what you are, huh?\u201d</p><p>Pike\u2019s eyes grew and he led me away from the officers checking out the scene. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought Emerson was the unholy one.\u201d</p><p>He looked genuinely offended. \u201cI\u2019m not unholy. I\u2019m an ancient legend\u2014my family has been shifting for hundreds of generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifting? So what are you\u2014?\u201d I paused, glancing down at those nails again and then backing away. \u201cNo. Oh, no. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bird. You\u2019re the fucking black bird, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiseased flying rodent . . .\u201d</p><p>Pike\u2019s lip curled into a snarl. \u201cThose are pigeons. And you should talk! Bats are, like, the most rabid animals in history.\u201d</p><p>I was suddenly more offended by Pike than I was by Nicolette\u2019s attempted thrashing. \u201cI do not turn into a bat!\u201d</p><p>Moyer stepped over, his bushy eyebrows curved down in confusion. \u201cUgh, are you guys through here? We\u2019re just about to take Nicolette downtown. Apparently, she planned to take out all three of the competitors and launch her own fashion show at the end of it.\u201d</p><p>Pike grimaced.</p><p>\u201cWell, it does make sense. Her cuts on Emerson\u2019s fabric were impeccable\u2014except for going against the grain.\u201d</p><p>Both Moyer and Pike gaped at me and I shrugged. \u201cJust an observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Moyer said to me. \u201cGood thing she didn\u2019t get her hands on you.\u201d</p><p>My hand immediately went to my smashed nose and crushed browbone that had since healed.</p><p>Love that vampire super-speed thing.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Pike said after Moyer departed. \u201cI think we make a pretty good crime-fighting team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Bird Boy and Kick Ass?\u201d</p><p>Pike cocked a brow. \u201cYou know Bird Boy just saved your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d I paused, considering. \u201cIt took you long enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
