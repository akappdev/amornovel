She tried to summon up a perfect smile, kind but not encouraging. Though she wasn\u2019t positive that smile even existed.</p><p>Whatever she came up with would be better than an utterly inappropriate shriek of Bloody hell, not again! Daughters of marquesses\u2014even deceased and arguably mad marquesses\u2014did not shriek. More\u2019s the pity.</p><p>The smile didn\u2019t seem to work, so she trotted out her standard answer: \u201cYou do me too much honor, Lord Dibbleshire, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d he responded, rather unexpectedly. Then he frowned. \u201cI mean, no! No honor is too great for you. I have fought against my better judgment and while I realize that there are those who consider your reputation to be sullied by your profession, I know the truth. The truth shall prevail!\u201d</p><p>Well, that was something. But before India could comment on the truth (or lack thereof), he toppled onto his knees. \u201cI will marry you, Lady Xenobia India St. Clair,\u201d he bellowed, widening his eyes to indicate his own shock at this declaration. \u201cI, Baron Dibbleshire, will marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do get up,\u201d she said, resisting the urge to groan.</p><p>\u201cI know that you will refuse me, owing to your inestimable modesty. But I have made up my mind, Lady Xenobia. The protection of my title\u2014and, of course, yours as well\u2014will overcome the ill effects of your unfortunate occupation. A plight to which you were driven, a point I shall make early and often. The ton will accept us . . . they will accept you, once you have the benefit of becoming Baroness Dibbleshire.\u201d</p><p>Aggravation marched up her spine like a troop of perfectly dressed soldiers. True, her reputation was tarnished by the fact that she refused to stay home practicing her needlework. But as she was the daughter of a marquess, technically a Dibbleshire would be lucky to dance with her. Not that she cared about such things. Still, her godmother accompanied her everywhere\u2014even now Lady Adelaide Swift was likely within earshot\u2014and if nothing else, Adelaide\u2019s chaperonage had ensured that India remain as pure as the driven snow despite her unfortunate occupation.</p><p>Who would have guessed that taking on the task of ordering people\u2019s lives would have tarnished her lily-white wings?</p> <p>At that moment, the door to the sitting room opened and her suitor\u2019s mother appeared. India\u2019s head began to pound. She never should have agreed to Lady Dibbleshire\u2019s plea that India refurbish her drawing room, no matter how interesting a challenge it was to strip the room of its Egyptian furnishings.</p><p>\u201cHoward, what in heaven\u2019s name are you doing?\u201d the lady demanded, making the whole situation even more farcical than it already was.</p><p>Dibbleshire sprang to his feet with surprising ease, inasmuch as his center of gravity was quite low slung and hung over his breeches. \u201cI have just informed Lady Xenobia that I love her, and she has agreed to become my wife!\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s eyes were met\u2014thankfully\u2014by a gleam of sympathy in Lady Dibbleshire\u2019s. \u201cHis lordship has misunderstood,\u201d India told her.</p><p>\u201cAlas, I have no doubt of that. Child,\u201d Howard\u2019s mother said, \u201cevery time I think that you have demonstrated the depths of your similarity to your father, you astonish me yet again.\u201d</p><p>Dibbleshire scowled and looked, spaniel-like, back to India. \u201cI will not allow you to refuse me. I haven\u2019t slept for two nights, unable to think of anything but you. I have made up my mind to rescue you from your life of drudgery!\u201d</p><p>He reached out his hand, and India nimbly stepped back. \u201cLord Dibbleshire\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou move from house to house, ceaselessly working.\u201d His pale blue eyes gazed at her with devotion.</p> <p>\u201cDear Lord, Howard,\u201d Lady Dibbleshire exclaimed, \u201cif our estate is ever lost, I am happy to think that you will be able to support us by making a living on the stage. However, it is my duty as a mother to point out that you are being rather vulgar.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, his lordship had confused vulgarity with honor; he gave his mother a ferocious glare.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia is our dear and valued guest,\u201d her ladyship continued, \u201cwho has been kind enough to aid me with restoration of the drawing room, as well as persuading the inestimable Mrs. Flushing to be our cook. For which\u201d\u2014she turned to India\u2014\u201cI shall be eternally grateful.\u201d</p><p>India had the knack of moving excellent servants into households where they would be appreciated and well paid. Mrs. Flushing had been languishing in the employ of a dyspeptic general, and was far happier cooking for Dibbleshire and his mother.</p><p>\u201cAnd Howard,\u201d Lady Dibbleshire continued, \u201cclearly you too are enjoying Mrs. Flushing\u2019s menus, given your expanding middle.\u201d</p><p>He scowled again and pulled at his waistcoat.</p><p>India opened her mouth to say something soothing, but at that moment her godmother bustled into the room, accompanied by a stream of words. \u201cDarlings,\u201d Lady Adelaide cried, \u201cthat lovely Mr. Sheraton has sent a delectable small mahogany table. Jane, you will adore it, simply adore it!\u201d She and Lady Dibbleshire had been school friends; indeed, nearly all of India\u2019s clients were her godmother\u2019s near and dear acquaintances.</p><p>\u201cHow splendid,\u201d Lady Dibbleshire said. \u201cWhere will you place it, Lady Xenobia?\u201d</p><p>India had become famous for designing rooms in which furniture was scattered in unstudied, asymmetrical seating arrangements. \u201cI shall have to see it to be sure, but in the grouping under the south window, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d Adelaide exclaimed, clapping her hands. \u201cYour drawing room will be the talk of London, Jane, mark my words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall come take a look,\u201d Lady Dibbleshire replied, \u201cjust as soon as I\u2019ve persuaded my feckless son that your goddaughter has far better things to do than marry one such as he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my dear, you mustn\u2019t be harsh to sweet Howard.\u201d Adelaide moved over to Dibbleshire and took his hand. \u201cI\u2019m certain that India would be ecstatic to marry you, if only the circumstances were different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never burden your name with the social opprobrium resulting from the path my life has taken,\u201d India told him, following up with a smile and a gaze that indicated clear-eyed courage and self-sacrifice. \u201cBesides, I saw Miss Winifred Landel watching you last night, though you were tactful enough to overlook her obvious infatuation. Who am I to stand in the way of such an advantageous match?\u201d</p><p>Lord Dibbleshire blinked at India and said, uncertainly, \u201cBecause I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou merely think you love me,\u201d she assured him, \u201cdue to your charitable heart. I assure you that you need not worry about my plight. As a matter of fact, I have made up my mind to withdraw from my profession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d This from Lady Dibbleshire, whose mouth actually fell open. \u201cYou do realize that at this very moment ladies all over England are imploring their husbands to obtain your services?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But India and her godmother worked like a well-oiled machine when it came to dissuading men from proclaiming their love. \u201cYou should ask Miss Landel to marry you,\u201d Adelaide said, patting Lord Dibbleshire\u2019s hand vigorously. \u201cIndia is already considering three or four proposals, including those from the Earl of Fitzroy and Mr. Nugent\u2014the one who\u2019s from Colleton, not the other one, from Bettleshangler. He will be a viscount someday.\u201d</p><p>At this news, his shoulders slumped again. But Adelaide glanced at India, a twinkle in her eyes, before turning back. \u201cBesides, I am not convinced that you two suit each other, Howard, dear. My darling goddaughter does have a bit of a temper. And of course you\u2019re aware that Fitzroy and Nugent are somewhat older than you. As is India. She is twenty-six, and you are still a young man.\u201d</p><p>Dibbleshire\u2019s head swung up and he peered at India.</p><p>\u201cMiss Landel is barely out of the schoolroom,\u201d Lady Dibbleshire put in, nimbly taking up the ball. \u201cYou can guide her into maturity, Howard.\u201d</p> <p>He blinked rapidly at this idea, clearly reconsidering his infatuation now that he\u2019d learned the object of his adoration was four years older than he.</p><p>India suppressed the instinct to pat the corners of her eyes for wrinkles and composed her face to look old. Almost elderly. Presumably her white-blond hair would help; Adelaide was always pestering her to tint it one color or another. \u201cLord Dibbleshire, I shall hold your proposal sacrosanct, enshrined in my memory.\u201d She held her breath.</p><p>His lordship\u2019s chest swelled and he said, \u201cI commend your intention to retire from this invidious profession, if one can call it that, Lady Xenobia. And I wish you all possible good fortune, of course.\u201d</p><p>His love for her was dead.</p><p>Right.</p> <p>A few moments later India walked upstairs to a small sitting room that Lady Dibbleshire had designated as her and her godmother\u2019s retreat during the renovation process. Catching sight of herself in a mirror, she peered closer to see whether wrinkles indeed radiated out from her eyes. She couldn\u2019t see any. In fact, at twenty-six, she looked fairly the same as she had at sixteen: too much hair, too much lower lip, too much bosom.</p><p>There was no visible sign of the hard knot in her chest, the one that tightened every time she thought about accepting a proposal of marriage.</p><p>She was good at refusing men. It was the idea of accepting one that made her feel as if she couldn\u2019t breathe. But she had to marry. She couldn\u2019t go on like this forever, moving from house to house, dragging her godmother with her.</p><p>After she had been orphaned at fifteen and sent to live in Adelaide\u2019s disordered, chaotic house, India had quickly realized that if she didn\u2019t organize her godmother\u2019s household, no one would. And after Lady Adelaide had lavishly praised India to one of her friends, boasting that they would pay a visit that summer and \u201cstraighten everything out,\u201d India had tackled the friend\u2019s household as well. One thing had led to another, and for the last ten years she and Adelaide had made two or three such visits a year.</p><p>It was exhilarating to create order from chaos. She would renovate a room or two, turn the staffing upside down, and leave, knowing that the household would run like clockwork, at least until the owners mucked it up again. Every house presented a different\u2014and fascinating\u2014challenge.</p><p>But it was time to stop. To marry. The problem was that having sifted through so many households, she had received an intimate view of marriage, without seeing anything that particularly recommended the marital state . . . except children.</p> <p>That had been the hardest part of her job, finding nannies and refurbishing nurseries for young women her own age. Her longing for a baby had brought her to the decision that it was time to marry.</p><p>The only question was who to marry.</p><p>Or should that be whom to marry?</p><p>She was never certain of her grammar, thanks to her father\u2019s inability to keep a governess. Servants, it seemed, didn\u2019t like going unpaid. Moreover, God-fearing English servants also disliked the fact that their masters danced naked in the moonlight.</p><p>India winced at the memory. She had spent years trailing her parents, her vibrant, loving, half-mad parents, longing for affection, attention, even supper. . . . They had loved her. Surely.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s parents had good and bad sides. Her parents had loved her, which was good. They had danced attendance on a moon goddess instead of the Queen of England, which was bad.</p><p>They had sometimes forgotten to feed her. That was the worst.</p><p>Without question, her fear of marriage really went back to her childhood. Marriage meant trusting a husband to take care of her, instead of taking care of herself. It meant accepting that he would be in charge of their accounts. The very idea of a man like Dibbleshire talking to an estate manager made her shiver.</p> <p>She swallowed hard. She thought she could get used to living with a man. But could she obey one?</p><p>Her father had been very dear, but he had played ducks and drakes with the estate, neglecting to pay the baker\u2019s and butler\u2019s accounts, as well as regularly forgetting the existence of his only child. He and her mother had died during a trip to London that they took for an unknown reason, although they\u2019d had no money for such an excursion.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for her stomach to clench at the idea of putting herself in the hands of a man.</p><p>Still, she could do it\u2014with one minor tweak.</p><p>She simply had to find a man who was sweet and kind, and smart enough to realize that she should be the one to run their household.</p><p>If she, Xenobia India St. Clair, expert at turning chaos into order, truly put her mind to the task, how hard could it be?</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The same day</p><p>40, Hanover Square</p><p>London residence of Mr. Tobias Dautry, Esq.</p><p>By right of birth, a duke\u2019s eldest son should be sleek and self-satisfied, assured of land and titles by England\u2019s laws of primogeniture. He ought to have no worries greater than the threat of split breeches while riding to the hounds, or a mistress who leaves him for a marquess with a better command of his tool.</p><p>But that would be an eldest son born within wedlock.</p><p>It is an entirely different story if the son in question is illegitimate, born of a ravishing but itinerant opera singer, a woman who had paused at the Duke of Villiers\u2019s country estate long enough to give birth to a son and wandered on like a lark seeking warmer climes.</p><p>Thorn Dautry was neither sleek nor self-satisfied. Even when he seemed relaxed, he was alert to possible danger, and with good reason: he\u2019d spent his formative years warding off death.</p><p>As an adult, he\u2019d become a man who controlled his world and everything and everyone in it, and he didn\u2019t bother to pretend he didn\u2019t know the reason. Not when he was sitting across from his best friend, Vander, whose childhood had had just as formative an effect on him.</p><p>A deep voice broke the silence in the library. \u201cI don\u2019t approve, Thorn. While Laetitia Rainsford won\u2019t make a terrible wife for some fellow, she\u2019s not right for you. Why in God\u2019s name did you choose her?\u201d</p><p>Evander Septimus Brody, future Duke of Pindar, was sprawled opposite, a brandy glass balanced on his stomach. Vander had been Thorn\u2019s closest friend since Eton, when both of them had been bent on proving themselves with their fists. Their failure to beat each other senseless had led to a lifelong bond.</p><p>Sometimes Thorn felt he and Vander were two sides of the same coin: he, a duke\u2019s illegitimate son who had to fight off the world\u2019s opinion, and Vander, a duke\u2019s legitimate son who didn\u2019t fit the mold. Vander was too direct, too male, too violent to suit the sensibilities of English society. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorn raised an eyebrow. Laetitia was widely viewed as the most exquisite woman on the marriage mart. Her charms were obvious. \u201cYou really can\u2019t guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know she\u2019s beautiful. And you\u2019d be stealing her from any number of young bucks who write sonnets to her nose. But she\u2019s not right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d Thorn was genuinely curious. Vander didn\u2019t look like a future duke\u2014his hair was shaggy, and he had the jaw of a prizefighter, not a nobleman\u2014and he didn\u2019t act like one either. He never went to balls, so how in the hell would he have met a virtuous young lady like Miss Laetitia Rainsford?</p><p>\u201cI was seated beside her at a dinner party given by my uncle. She certainly is pretty enough. But as your wife?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind. She\u2019s the one.\u201d Thorn took a drink, returning his brandy glass to precisely the same spot on the side table. \u201cShe is beautiful, well born, and well bred. What more could I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA brain,\u201d Vander stated, his eyes not leaving Thorn\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t look for intelligence in bed,\u201d Thorn said dryly. In his estimation, Laetitia had all the requisite qualities for bedding and mothering, even if a high degree of intelligence didn\u2019t seem to be one of them. \u201cI believe one of the reasons that my factories thrive is that I suit talent to position. In fact, I see no meaningful difference between the two.\u201d</p><p>Vander snorted. \u201cYou think I\u2019m harsh? You will have to live with the woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I also live with my butler,\u201d Thorn pointed out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference, really, besides the fact I don\u2019t have to share a bed with Iffley? Laetitia will be the mother of my children, and it is my distinct impression that she is an excellent nurturer. In fact, I met her in the Round Pond in Kensington Gardens, where she was watching boys sail toy boats.\u201d</p> <p>His intended probably wouldn\u2019t appreciate the comparison, but Thorn had the notion that she was like a rescued hound, one that would adoringly follow her new master in return for some kindness. That was absurd, given that she was as beautiful as a wild rose, with hair like a Botticelli angel. By all rights, she should be arrogantly aware of her dominion over men. But instead she had a desperate look about her eyes, as if she needed saving.</p><p>It was a fair trade, in his estimation. Her beauty in return for his protection.</p><p>\u201cYou plan to drop your wife at this new estate of yours with a brood of children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no reason to live at Starberry Court with her.\u201d His own father had taught him little more than how to fence. Thorn intended to be that type of father, and he needn\u2019t be in residence to do it.</p><p>\u201cA mother does more than nurture her family,\u201d Vander objected. \u201cI hear scientists have estimated that half of one\u2019s intellect comes from each parent.\u201d</p><p>Thorn just looked at him. His children would be his children, just as his father\u2019s were his father\u2019s. He and the Duke of Villiers were carved from the same block of marble. It wasn\u2019t just the white streak in his hair that had appeared in his and his father\u2019s hair after each of them had turned nineteen. It was the set of his jaw, the way Villiers calculated outcomes, even the way he breathed air.</p> <p>If one wanted more proof, it could be had in the fact that the duke had spawned children with five different mothers, and each of those children was\u2014in his or her own way\u2014a copy of their father. \u201cOf course, I hope that they look like their mother,\u201d he added, with a wry look.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Vander said, disgusted. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll raise the poor babes as a pack of wolves.\u201d</p><p>Thorn grinned at that. \u201cYou\u2019d better find someone to marry. You don\u2019t want your wolves to be puny in comparison to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met the right woman yet.\u201d Vander took a gulp of brandy, slumping lower in his chair. Thorn never sprawled. Sprawling would put him at a disadvantage; he would lose critical seconds before he could dodge a blow and launch an attack.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Eleanor to find you someone suitable?\u201d Thorn asked. His stepmother, the Duchess of Villiers, knew everyone in society worth knowing. Moreover, she was brilliantly strategic and would enjoy determining the future of the duchy of Pindar.</p><p>But Vander shook his head. \u201cI want what your father has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want Eleanor?\u201d Thorn was, frankly, astonished. His stepmother was beautiful, intelligent, witty . . . and she was also deeply in love with his father. Eleanor wasn\u2019t interested in younger men, nor indeed in any man other than her husband.</p><p>He gave Vander the kind of look he reserved for pickpockets just before he knocked them off their feet. \u201cYou keep your hands off my stepmother. I had no idea that you had propensities of that nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see your face!\u201d Vander was positively howling with laughter. \u201cYour stepmother is a very nice woman,\u201d he said finally, more or less recovering himself. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want her, you idiot. I want the type of marriage those two have. I want what Villiers has.\u201d He took another slug. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll settle for anything less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider the marriage I\u2019m contemplating to be lesser,\u201d Thorn objected. \u201cJust different. My father\u2019s life revolves around Eleanor, and hers around him. I can\u2019t see either of us altering our habits for a woman. What about all those horses you\u2019re training, and the fact you\u2019re constantly off to one steeplechase or another? I have no problem imagining you with a wife\u2014but one who is the center of your life? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would make time,\u201d Vander stated.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really have no idea, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that Laetitia is remarkably beautiful and she\u2019s a lady, which will protect my children from being shunned as a result of my birth. Part of the reason I treasure my stepmother is that she\u2019s unlike any other woman I\u2019ve met. Quite frankly, I\u2019ve come to believe another such woman doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to, Thorn.\u201d Vander came to his feet but didn\u2019t walk away, just stood, staring down at Thorn. \u201cI want to love a woman the way your father loves his wife. I don\u2019t care if she looks like an apple seller. I want to feel passion for the woman I marry. It doesn\u2019t seem too much to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father almost married a woman who belonged in Bedlam,\u201d Thorn said, leaning back so he could see Vander\u2019s face. \u201cIt was pure accident that paired him with Eleanor. Are you hoping that the perfect woman will simply wander in your door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019d rather not bother,\u201d Vander said flatly. He moved to the decanter and refilled his glass. \u201cIf I\u2019m to change my life to suit a woman, she\u2019d damned well better be worth my trouble.\u201d</p><p>He had a point there. Thorn was fairly sure marriage would be a bother. In order to woo Laetitia, he had been obliged to buy a country estate, although he was perfectly comfortable living in London. What\u2019s more, he was taking on a wife when he already had twenty-three servants, along with men working in factories, solicitors\u2019 offices, and the rest.</p><p>But he wanted children, and for that he needed a wife. He liked children. Children, whether boys or girls, were curious.

You are signing up to sleep with no woman other than Laetitia Rainsford for the rest of your bleeding life.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cShe will give me children. And I have no doubt she will be faithful, so I\u2019ll pay her the same respect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLoyalty is one of your few virtues,\u201d Vander acknowledged. \u201cThe problem with you,\u201d he added, staring contemplatively into his brandy, \u201cis your infernal childhood.\u201d</p><p>Thorn couldn\u2019t argue with that. Spending his boyhood as a penniless mudlark\u2014diving into the Thames to search for anything of value in the muck\u2014had shaped him. He had learned the hard way that danger lurked where you couldn\u2019t see it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust anyone,\u201d Vander continued, waxing philosophical. \u201cYour father should have kept a better eye on you. I\u2019ll be damned if I misplace any of my children, even if I produce a bastard, which I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy childhood made me what I am. I wouldn\u2019t trade it to be the pampered son of a duke.\u201d</p><p>Vander shot him a sardonic look. Thorn was the only one who knew what horrors had lurked inside the Duke of Pindar\u2019s country seat.</p> <p>\u201cI trust my father, Eleanor, my siblings,\u201d Thorn stated. \u201cAnd you. That\u2019s good enough.\u201d</p><p>Frankly, he didn\u2019t waste much time thinking about trusting women. And he found it rare that he respected them. His life revolved around his work, and most gentlewomen didn\u2019t seem to do anything except their part in bed, though he generally did most of the work there too. That was the nature of it. He wasn\u2019t a man to give a woman her way between the sheets.</p><p>\u201cI trust you,\u201d Vander replied. He added no other names. Not that Thorn expected him to, because he knew there were no other names to add. Vander\u2019s face had darkened, and as Thorn saw it, his friend\u2019s darkness was his own business.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I want a marriage like your father\u2019s,\u201d Vander continued, staring at the fire through his empty glass. \u201cThere have to be more people in the world I can trust than a muscle-bound, sweaty bastard like yourself.\u201d</p><p>Back when they\u2019d been fourteen, that weak jest would have been an invitation, and the two of them would have pummeled each other until half the furniture in the room had been broken . . . and they\u2019d come out the other side panting and happy.</p><p>What\u2019s more, that remark, or another like it, would surely have been made on this very day of the year, because it was the anniversary of Vander\u2019s mother\u2019s death, which he generally spent skating on the edge of violence. Consequently, every year on this day Thorn ensured he was at Vander\u2019s side.</p> <p>Thorn got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m sick of sitting around with a maudlin romantic, talking about women. Foil or \u00e9p\u00e9e?\u201d</p><p>Vander rose with no sign that three glasses of brandy had impaired him. Probably they hadn\u2019t; he seemed to have been endowed with the ability to burn off alcohol within minutes.</p><p>Predictably, Vander chose the heavier blade, the \u00e9p\u00e9e. Thorn was the better fencer; Vander had the habit of losing his temper and slashing instead of strategizing.</p><p>Once in Thorn\u2019s ballroom, they stripped down to shirts and breeches and began circling each other, blades poised.</p><p>But even as he calculated every shift in Vander\u2019s weight, Thorn kept thinking about marriage. Laetitia wasn\u2019t bright, it was true, but frankly, he believed that to be a decided advantage in a wife. His mother had been that rare thing, a strong-minded woman with a vocation, and her art had mattered more to her than her son.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have any interest in a woman with a profession. He wanted a woman who would never dream of leaving her children\u2014for any reason. Laetitia adored children, and she clearly had no larger aspirations than motherhood. He had decided five minutes after meeting her that she would be his bride, though he hadn\u2019t yet informed her of the fact.</p><p>Her approval was unnecessary, really, since their marriage was a matter of negotiation between himself and her parents. After meeting with Lord Rainsford, he understood that he would pay dearly for Laetitia\u2019s beauty. But more importantly, he would pay the highest price for her birth.</p><p>The only remaining obstacle was Lady Rainsford; her parents had made it clear that her approval was necessary.</p> <p>Vander was fighting like a madman, to the point where he had twice nearly broken through Thorn\u2019s guard. His chest was heaving and he was bathed in sweat. But he looked better than he had earlier: less fraught, less furious . . . less grief-stricken.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Time to go in for the kill. In a coordinated series of strokes, Thorn danced around the edge of Vander\u2019s blade, sliced his right arm around and under, feigned an attack, whirled, switched hands, came at him with the left.</p><p>Touch\u00e9.</p><p>Vander\u2019s response to defeat was a stream of oaths that would have made a sailor blanch. Thorn bent over to catch his breath, watching drops of sweat fall to the floor. He couldn\u2019t best Vander in the boxing ring, but he could damn well wipe the floor with him when they held swords. Even better, the air of madness that hung about his friend every year on the anniversary of his mother\u2019s death had evaporated.</p><p>Thorn pulled off his shirt and used it to mop his chest and face.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that Laetitia will like you?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Like me?\u2019 What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you look. Does she seem attracted to you?\u201d</p><p>Thorn glanced down at himself. Long bands of muscle covered his body, forming ridges over his taut abdomen. He kept his body in fighting shape, and no woman had yet expressed a complaint. \u201cAre you talking about the scars?\u201d Like every mudlark who survived into adulthood, he was covered with them.</p><p>\u201cYou never go into society, so you wouldn\u2019t know, but Laetitia\u2019s just spent the season dancing with a crowd of wand-thin mollies with no need to shave. We\u2019re too big, and we\u2019d both have a beard within the day if we allowed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose men were all at school with us,\u201d Thorn said, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019re taking marriage too seriously. It\u2019s a transaction like any other. I\u2019m giving her a country house; that will make up for my brute proportions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Vander said, pausing in the middle of rubbing sweat from his hair. \u201cYou really mean it, don\u2019t you? I can\u2019t see you as a rural squire.\u201d</p><p>Neither could Thorn, but as he understood it, children required fresh air and open spaces. His new estate was close to London, and he could easily visit.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do with yourself there?\u201d Vander gave a bark of laughter. \u201cGo fishing? I can see you fashioning a new rod and selling the design for a hundred pounds, but reeling in a trout? No.\u201d</p><p>Thorn had just acquired a rubber factory that was losing money fast. For a moment, he imagined a rubber fishing rod\u2014he had to design something profitable that the factory could make\u2014but then dismissed it. \u201cI won\u2019t be there often,\u201d he said, tossing his shirt to the side. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the trout for idiots who fancy shriveling their balls in rushing water.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was an East Londoner to the core, and he\u2019d only catch a trout if he were starving. Plus, his time as a mudlark had left one indelible mark: he didn\u2019t like rivers. Given a choice, he\u2019d never go in one again, and certainly never dive to the bottom.</p><p>\u201cI like fishing,\u201d Vander objected, pulling on one of the linen shirts that Thorn\u2019s valet had left stacked on a filigree chair.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m inviting Laetitia and her parents to the country in a fortnight or so, and you can come along and fish for your supper. I have to persuade Laetitia\u2019s mother to accept my baseborn blood, and you can be proof that I know the right sort. I only hope you\u2019ve never met each other.\u201d</p><p>Vander threw his drenched shirt at Thorn\u2019s head, but it fell to the floor. Thorn was already heading out the door.</p> <p>He had a factory to save.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>India made an excuse and did not join the Dibbleshires for tea; there was no point in risking yet another passionate declaration from his lordship. Instead, she and her godmother retired to their sitting room, where India began opening the mail Adelaide\u2019s butler had sent over by a groom. Letter after letter implored her to cure various ills: a disorganized house, an unfashionable dining room, even (implicitly) a marriage.</p><p>But she resolutely wrote back refusals, mindful of her decision to marry. She even refused an offer from the Regent\u2019s secretary asking if she would renovate his private chambers in Brighton. The only truly tempting letter came from the Duchess of Villiers. Eleanor was older than India, and mother of an eight-year-old boy, but despite these differences, they had struck up a close friendship. Eleanor was brilliant, well read, and witty without being cruel, and India admired and adored her.</p><p>In fact, Eleanor was everything India planned to be, once she had time to read the books she had missed as a child. Someday she would like to invite Eleanor and her other friends to a country house of her own. They would spend lazy days in the shade of a willow, talking about literature. She would understand grammar by then, and never worry about who and whom again, let alone lie and lay.</p> <p>But now Eleanor was writing to ask a special favor. \u201cAdelaide, did we meet Tobias Dautry when we stayed with the Duke of Villiers?\u201d</p><p>Her godmother put down her teacup. \u201cNo, he was in Scotland at the time. You must have heard of Dautry. He\u2019s the oldest of Villiers\u2019s bastards, and by all accounts, he owns five factories and is richer than Midas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t he invent a blast furnace, or something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and sold it to a coal magnate for ten thousand pounds. I must say, I do feel sympathetic toward Villiers\u2019s by-blows. It must be awkward to be brought up as a lord or lady, with expectations of an excellent marriage. Who would choose to marry a by-blow? Still, I hear that His Grace has given the girls outrageously large dowries.\u201d</p><p>India knew she was cynical, but common sense told her that those girls would indeed make excellent matches.</p><p>\u201cDautry is different from the others,\u201d Adelaide continued. \u201cRougher. I think he was living on the streets when Villiers found him, and he was already twelve years old. Eleanor never managed to civilize him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I met him?\u201d India asked. What with one thing and another, she had been to hundreds of social events in London in the last few years, although she had never debuted. It was her considered opinion that the queen had no more interest in meeting her than she had in meeting the queen.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a man of business. Knows his place, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he can\u2019t have avoided society entirely,\u201d India said, \u201cbecause Eleanor writes in this letter that he\u2019s courting Laetitia Rainsford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally!\u201d Adelaide\u2019s mouth formed a perfect circle. \u201cI wonder how he came to meet Lala? She\u2019s so pretty that I would have thought her parents could do better. And Lady Rainsford was one of the royal ladies-in-waiting before her marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney,\u201d India suggested.</p><p>\u201cMoney is not everything.\u201d</p><p>Adelaide could say that because she had never lacked it. India, on the other hand, had grown up on an estate that had been falling to wrack and ruin. In her view, money was everything. Or nearly everything.</p><p>\u201cDo read to me what she says?\u201d</p> <p>India looked back at the letter. \u201cShe begins by telling me that Theodore beat his father at a game of chess for the first time, which apparently made them both very happy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness me, the child is only eight, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>India nodded. \u201cThen she writes, \u2018I know how much you are in demand, but I write with the faint hope that you are free. His Grace\u2019s eldest son, Tobias Dautry, has recently acquired a country estate just outside London called Starberry Court. It likely needs some refurbishing, although Tobias bought it with its contents intact. He is courting Miss Laetitia Rainsford and he wishes to ensure that the house is in suitable condition before he invites her parents to the country. Naturally, I told him that you were the only person I would trust in such an endeavor.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor is not happy about the match,\u201d Adelaide stated. \u201cHow interesting! I suspect that means that the duke is equally displeased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth gave you that impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Eleanor were happy about Dautry\u2019s courtship, she would say so. And you know how informal Eleanor is; she uses Laetitia\u2019s full name. She doesn\u2019t like Lala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only met her once, but I thought she was a very sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, but not very bright,\u201d Adelaide said with a touch of asperity. \u201cI suppose that explains why the duke and duchess are not in favor. Her parents must have weighed her lack of wits against his unfortunate birth. What did you say that estate he bought was called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarberry Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Earl of Jupp\u2019s country house!\u201d Adelaide exclaimed. \u201cSupposedly he draped the walls in red damask and invited fourteen Italian women to live with him. The naughty sort of Italians. He held very popular parties, by all accounts. No one ever admitted to going to one, but everyone seemed to know the details.\u201d</p><p>One quickly lost all na\u00efvet\u00e9 when investigating the antics that could disrupt a badly managed household, so India nodded, unsurprised. \u201cStarberry Court became a bawdy house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely a brothel, since the services offered were gratis,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cJupp died last November, I think it was, and everyone said that he was brought low by the French disease. I expect the furnishings are deplorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could strip the damask in a day or two.\u201d A little prickle of excitement went down India\u2019s spine at the idea of tackling such a large task. Of course, there was the issue of finding a husband, but surely that could wait for a few more weeks. These days a small army of craftsmen awaited her command. She could have a house painter, a master wood carver, and a stonemason on the doorstep in a matter of days.</p><p>\u201cYou could likely make it acceptable,\u201d Adelaide conceded. \u201cStill, I don\u2019t know what Dautry was thinking, buying that particular estate. Given the circumstances of his birth, why buy an estate with such a sordid reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably an excellent bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if Lord Rainsford is feeling a pinch. His wife is both spiteful and recklessly extravagant. Perhaps Lala is being sacrificed on the altar of parental excess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEleanor goes on to say that she and the duke will be in attendance when Mr. Dautry entertains the Rainsfords in his new house,\u201d India said. \u201cShe invites us to stay as well. I hardly think that accepting an offer of marriage from a duke\u2019s Midas-like son, even if he was born on the wrong side of the blanket, can be termed a sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong there. Lady Rainsford is one of the most arrogant women on God\u2019s earth, obsessed by her connection to the Court. Mark my words: she is mortified to think that one of her daughters is considering marriage to a bastard. What\u2019s more, Eleanor wouldn\u2019t want any child of her beloved Villiers being less than celebrated. She is ferociously loyal and protective of her husband\u2019s motley brood.\u201d</p><p>India folded up the letter. \u201cBut if Villiers champions the marriage\u2014which he must be doing, given that Eleanor will host the house party\u2014it will take place.\u201d She was reasonably certain that the duke got everything he wanted, whether that meant marrying his bastard son to a lady or to a royal princess. He was that type of man.</p><p>\u201cWe should do it!\u201d Adelaide exclaimed. \u201cLala\u2019s so witless that she might spend her whole life dancing attendance on her mother. Eleanor needs our help. That house needs our help. But heaven help her, that girl needs our help too.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more,\u201d she added gleefully, \u201cthe betrothal will take Lady Rainsford down a peg or two. I can\u2019t tell you how many times she\u2019s informed me that her family has attended royalty since the time of Henry VIII.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make Lala sound addled,\u201d India objected. \u201cI think her reputation for witlessness must be overstated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t read,\u201d Adelaide confided. \u201cShe told me herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needn\u2019t read once she\u2019s married to Midas; three secretaries can read aloud to her. Though I do think her governess should have been more persistent.\u201d India had fierce opinions about inadequate education.</p><p>\u201cBy all accounts, they tried. She still had a tutor as of last year, but she just couldn\u2019t grasp it. That must be the real reason the Rainsfords are considering this marriage. If she cannot read, she cannot run a household.\u201d Adelaide hesitated. \u201cI wonder if Dautry knows that?\u201d</p> <p>There was something about this proposed marriage that India didn\u2019t like. The mercantile nature of it was jarring.</p><p>On the other hand, her parents had married for love\u2014disastrously. Even though her father\u2019s estate desperately needed an influx of money in the form of a dowry, he had decided that happiness would solve everything. He had been wrong. Love was a terrible reason for marriage, in India\u2019s estimation.</p><p>\u201cEleanor is requesting that we spend the next fortnight at Starberry refurbishing the house, after which they would join us,\u201d India said.</p><p>Adelaide\u2019s expression cleared. \u201cAn excellent idea! And it would give you time to do something with your hair before we return to London.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s hair was thick and hard to handle, as well as being an unusual color, more like silver than gold. One minute Adelaide thought she should rinse it with rosemary extract, and the next with egg yolks. Or better yet, dye it yellow.</p><p>India simply instructed her maid to pin it up as best she could. In her experience, women were of the opinion that her hair could be \u201cbrightened up,\u201d but men seemed to like it as it was. India just thought there was too much of it.</p> <p>As best she could tell, she had her paternal grandmother\u2019s bosom, and there was too much of that too. Fashionable clothing was designed for small breasts, which always caused problems with fitting gowns\u2014but luckily, she hadn\u2019t had reason to dress fashionably. In fact, it was the opposite.</p><p>She had to wear gowns that promoted respect, but also trust. In order to do her job, the people who hired her must feel she could be trusted with their homes, and dressing in the very latest styles often frightened them.</p><p>Consequently, she traveled with three trunks, because she never knew how she might need to present herself. Sometimes the master of a household responded best if she dressed like a duchess, with an emphasis on diamonds. (They invariably assumed that her jewels were family heirlooms, even though India had bought them herself.)</p><p>Other times she presented herself as a docile, modest young lady, who valued every word that dropped from the man\u2019s lips. And then there were times when the seventeen-year-old scion of the house was clearly going to make a nuisance of himself. She would come to breakfast with braided hair, wearing a dress of brown homespun reminiscent of a German governess.</p><p>If she took on Starberry Court, she should probably wear something that minimized her rank. A man who wished to rise in the world and overcome his illegitimate birth would be looking for reassurance. She would have to protect Dautry\u2019s sense of amour propre, while giving tactful instruction about the manners and style of a great house.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, making up her mind. \u201cWe\u2019ll say farewell to Lady Dibbleshire and inform Mr. Dautry that we will help him with the renovation. And with catching the woman of his dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent plan,\u201d Adelaide said, nodding. \u201cBut India darling, I must remind you that time is passing. This house cannot be an excuse to put off a decision about marriage.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s good cheer wavered. She summoned a smile. \u201cThe house won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must decide between your various suitors, my dear.\u201d Adelaide patted her hand. \u201cThey won\u2019t wait forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d India said, the words hollow even to her own ears. \u201cI mean to find a perfect husband, Adelaide. Just as soon as I have time.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>June 17</p><p>40, Hanover Square</p><p>London</p><p>India was happy to see that the Duke of Villiers\u2019s eldest son lived in a spacious town house built of white marble, its pillars the perfect size and shape to support its portico. There was nothing she liked more than to be given carte blanche in her renovations, and from all appearances, her client had the funds to do so.</p><p>But the moment she and Adelaide entered his library and Dautry rose from behind his desk to greet them, she realized she had made a grave miscalculation.</p><p>He walked toward them with the effortless confidence of a man who is formidable in every respect, even though he wore no coat or cravat, just a white linen shirt and breeches that stretched over his thigh muscles. Stubble darkened his jaw, and his hair was neither pulled back in a neat queue nor covered by a wig.</p><p>He looked like a farm laborer.</p><p>Or a king.</p><p>India would guess that he dominated any group of men in which he found himself. Birth hierarchy would be displaced by a more primal hierarchy of maleness. He breathed a power brewed from masculinity and intelligence, not from an accident of inheritance.</p><p>Still, his bones were knit together with a fineness that spoke of his father, of the Duke of Villiers. In fact, she could see the duke in Mr. Dautry\u2019s every lineament: in his high cheekbones, in the brutal turn of his jaw, even in the white streak that punctuated his black hair.</p><p>To her horror, India realized that all that maleness had kindled a sultry warmth in her stomach, and her pulse was thumping to a disgracefully erotic beat. She was both shocked and surprised by her body\u2019s reaction. She was decidedly not a woman who turned weak-kneed over a man.</p><p>The feeling, however, was decidedly not mutual. Indifferent eyes flicked over her, and he turned to her godmother. \u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d he said to Adelaide, bowing, \u201cit is a pleasure to meet you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adelaide giggled, a girlish sound that India had heard only once or twice. \u201cMr. Dautry, I fear you are quite mistaken. I am Lady Adelaide Swift. May I introduce you to my goddaughter, Lady Xenobia?\u201d</p><p>No sooner had surprise flashed across his face than it was gone. \u201cI am honored, Lady Adelaide,\u201d he said smoothly. He turned to India. \u201cMy apologies, Lady Xenobia. I assumed you were Lady Adelaide\u2019s companion, judging you far too young to have accomplished the miracles that the Duchess of Villiers credits you with.\u201d</p><p>His reference to her youth\u2014welcome though it might have been\u2014did not make up for his assumption about her status. The only thing that made her feel better was that she was almost certain that proper grammar would require \u201cwith which the duchess credits you.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Dautry bowed to her, though with none of the flourishes that men generally produced when introduced to the daughter of a marquess. Even those who knew something about her father\u2014that is, that he had been as daft as a chicken in the rain\u2014paid obeisance to her title. Yet this man didn\u2019t even bother to brush his lips over her glove.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a pleasure, Mr. Dautry,\u201d she murmured, wishing that she was wearing a gown that would bring a man to his knees. Irritatingly, that image just sent another streak of heat down her legs.</p><p>Of course, her godmother tumbled back into speech. \u201cI could never accomplish any of darling India\u2019s miracles, I assure you! Why, when we were at your father\u2019s home . . .\u201d Still talking, Adelaide trotted over to a sofa and happily accepted an offer of refreshment. India followed, watching as Mr. Dautry jerked his head at the butler, sending him off to fetch tea.</p><p>As Adelaide talked on and on, scarcely pausing for breath, Mr. Dautry\u2019s face took on a faint air of boredom. India adored her godmother, although she sometimes found herself dazed by Adelaide\u2019s prattle. But that was for her to feel, and no one else was allowed to exhibit the slightest hint of ennui in her godmother\u2019s company. She gave Mr. Dautry a narrow-eyed glance that said without words that his expression was an impertinence.</p><p>He just raised a brow, not a bit abashed.</p><p>Once the butler returned with a tray, Adelaide engaged herself pouring tea\u2014a ceremony that she took extremely seriously\u2014and there was finally a moment of silence in the room.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Lady Xenobia,\u201d Dautry said, \u201cmy stepmother assures me that you are quite proficient at renovating houses.\u201d</p><p>Proficient? Eleanor would never have damned her with such faint praise. Clearly, this man was not going to be as easily managed as most of her clients.</p><p>Temper was ever her failing, and sure enough a spark of it kindled at his insult. \u201cShe has informed me that you are desperate to refurbish a country house,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Next to her, Adelaide\u2019s brows drew together. There was nothing that Adelaide disliked more than rudeness, and India\u2019s tone had been slightly impolite\u2014as had Mr. Dautry\u2019s.</p><p>He settled back in his chair and gave India the smile with which a tiger greets a gazelle. \u201cYes, that\u2019s accurate. I hate to wait, you see. I am easily bored.\u201d</p><p>He probably never waited\u2014not for a carriage, nor for a woman, nor for anything.</p> <p>\u201cI was very pleased to hear that you are planning to marry,\u201d Adelaide said, jumping into the charged silence. \u201cDarling Eleanor confided that you have met an irresistible young lady.\u201d</p><p>India was watching Dautry carefully, and she saw a flash of irony in his eyes. This man found no woman irresistible.</p><p>\u201cI have indeed been lucky enough to meet a lady whom I hope to make mine,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut, of course, I must first ensure that my house provides a suitable setting for such a treasure.\u201d</p><p>The man was impossibly arrogant. He deserved to be taken down a peg or two, if only for his condescending reference to Lala as a \u201ctreasure.\u201d</p><p>But that was not her responsibility, India reminded herself. She merely had to be civil long enough to fulfill her promise to Eleanor. She leaned forward and gave him her \u201capproval smile,\u201d the one that promised she liked him, that said she thought he was marvelous. Men loved that smile.</p><p>Dautry\u2019s mouth tightened and his gray eyes became distinctly cold. She sat back abruptly.</p><p>All right. That didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to have done to Starberry Court, Mr. Dautry?\u201d she asked, pitching her voice toward crisp authority.</p> <p>\u201cI should like it to be habitable in a fortnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume the house is in excellent condition? A fortnight is an exceedingly short period of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Mr. Dautry said, draining his teacup in one swallow.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent a man around to ensure that it was structurally sound before I bought it.\u201d</p><p>She and Adelaide stared at him.</p><p>The irritated look crossed his face again. \u201cIt\u2019s a house,\u201d he stated. \u201cIn the right location, with a quite large estate attached to it. I was assured that this house is just what a young lady would desire\u2014or perhaps the better word is require. That is where you come in, Lady Xenobia.\u201d He put down the cup. \u201cBy the way, is that truly your name? \u2018Xenobia\u2019?\u201d</p><p>India knew perfectly well that people often thought her name extremely odd, but they rarely said so. For one thing, the name was recorded in Debrett\u2019s. And for another, anyone who had met her father was unsurprised by her name. She considered herself fortunate that she had not been christened \u201cMoonflower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she said evenly, and immediately returned to the topic at hand. \u201cDo you truly mean to tell me that you have no idea of the house\u2019s condition?\u201d</p><p>He answered her with a look. Apparently, he was not a man who chose to repeat himself.</p><p>\u201cMy dear sir,\u201d Adelaide cried, \u201cyou can\u2019t possibly think to have the house habitable in a fortnight. From what I\u2019ve heard, it served as a veritable brothel in the last years of its occupancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see why Jupp\u2019s activities, no matter how unsavory, should affect the condition of Starberry Court. There are brothels that are as elegantly appointed as ducal mansions.\u201d</p><p>India had no doubt that the man had seen the inside of many a brothel. \u201cLady Rainsford is an extremely fastidious woman,\u201d she said. \u201cShe judges her behavior above reproach and insists the same of others.\u201d</p><p>Dautry raised an eyebrow. \u201cI see. Are you well acquainted with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer virtues are widely known,\u201d India said, leaving it at that. \u201cIf you wish to marry her daughter, not a hint of ill repute can be attached to your estate. Even if the walls and furnishings are in decent repair, it will be well-nigh impossible to achieve the correct tenor in a mere fortnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTenor?\u201d He looked as if he was about to start laughing.</p><p>His expression sent pure irritation up India\u2019s spine. \u201cGiven your circumstances,\u201d she said, \u201cyour house must be not only charming, but also impeccably refined.\u201d</p><p>He looked as if he was about to say something derisive, so she added, \u201cAnother way to put this, Mr. Dautry, is that every detail must speak to your father\u2019s family, and not to your mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>At that, his eyes narrowed in a scary way, and Adelaide put down her teacup with a sharp click. \u201cIndia, dear, there are ways to communicate one\u2019s opinion, and I would beg you to be more respectful.\u201d She rose, wrapping her lacy shawl around her shoulders. \u201cMr. Dautry, would you be kind enough to bring me to your butler so that I might powder my nose?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India knew that by leaving the room, Adelaide hoped to bring an improper subject to a close. But Dautry returned from escorting Adelaide, walked straight back to the sofa, sat down, and said, \u201cI gather you are trying to inform me that Miss Rainsford is above my touch?\u201d His tone still held a hint of mockery, and the last of the simmering heat India had felt on first meeting him dissipated. This man was breathtakingly arrogant and quite dislikable.</p><p>\u201cI think we can both agree on that point, Mr. Dautry.\u201d Since he was setting her teeth on edge, she gave him a deliberately patronizing smile. \u201cYou have made an excellent choice, but your social deficit means that you face obstacles in winning the lady\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms across a chest that was far broader than it should have been. He had to be fifteen stone, and all of it muscle. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful to know what considerations you think make the lady such an excellent choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that our reasons differ.\u201d</p><p>Dautry couldn\u2019t have made it more obvious that he was prodding to see whether she was too missish to speak the truth aloud.</p> <p>\u201cIt scarcely matters, does it?\u201d India asked, stalling.</p><p>For his part, Thorn was reconsidering his conviction that ladies were tedious. This one, in particular, seemed to have a fiery temper that matched Vander\u2019s. And she became even more beautiful as her color heightened and her eyes sparked with irritation.</p><p>\u201cOne might say I fell in love at first sight,\u201d he said, quite untruthfully. \u201cI met Miss Rainsford in Kensington Gardens and was so enchanted that I cannot imagine marrying another. But that doesn\u2019t explain why you consider her such an excellent choice.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow, revealing patent disbelief in his declaration of love. But he had managed to goad her into an answer. \u201cYour birth presents an obvious and unavoidable challenge: you cannot marry just anyone. At the same time, your father is a duke, which means that your children\u2014if you marry well\u2014will be accepted in society by all but the most rigid sticklers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Thorn said dryly.</p> <p>\u201cI fail to see why you are feigning na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cSo Miss Rainsford is of birth sufficient to paper over my \u2018deficit,\u2019 as you termed it? I generally think of it as bastardy, but I know there are some ladies who do not care for the word.\u201d</p><p>Lady Xenobia didn\u2019t even flinch. She was dressed in a white, fluttering thing that made her look impossibly young, but it was becoming increasingly clear that, whatever her age, she had a steel backbone. No wonder Eleanor liked her.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, Lady Rainsford served as a lady-in-waiting to the queen. Yet her daughter is not pretentious in the least. Hopefully, she will not mind your disheveled appearance . . . much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather it does bother you,\u201d Thorn said, letting his amusement show.</p><p>The lady ignored that. \u201cInsofar as Lord Rainsford is not well off, and you have no need for a large dowry, this is an ideal match. I suggest we meet in two days to assess the condition of Starberry Court. I would estimate that the work will take from one to two months, depending on the state of the plumbing.\u201d</p> <p>She was clearly in a temper. Her eyes had turned squinty, which paradoxically just made her more attractive. It was hard not to wonder what all that passion would be like in bed.</p><p>When Lady Xenobia had first entered the study, Thorn had noticed her figure and her mouth\u2014no man alive would ignore that mouth. But he had been thinking of this as a cursory interview with a faux-titled charlatan who would demand a great deal of money for beautifying Starberry Court.</p><p>Now, though, he had a strong suspicion that if he checked Debrett\u2019s, \u201cXenobia\u201d would appear, likely engraved in gold.</p><p>His indifference had evaporated. Something about those furious blue eyes was giving him an erection. A very unwelcome erection, since he hadn\u2019t bothered to put on a coat when the ladies were announced.</p><p>Damn it, there was a reason men wore coats, and his reason was getting bigger every moment. Thank God they were sitting down. He had to get his body under control before Lady Adelaide returned and he was forced to stand.</p><p>\u201cThat was a very enlightening assessment, Lady Xenobia. And I appreciate your approval of my chosen spouse.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed again, and Thorn felt an answering throb in his cock. Damn it. \u201cBut inasmuch as you are unable to refurbish my house in a fortnight,\u201d he continued, \u201cI am forced to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem not to understand me. I\u2019m sure I can find someone to smarten up the house within the next two weeks. I\u2019m grateful for your advice, and I will certainly instruct whomever I engage to remove any trace of debauchery they may find.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cSwinging chairs or a mirrored ceiling, for example.\u201d</p><p>He had the keen sense that most young ladies would\u2014at the very least\u2014look curious at this glimpse into the further reaches of erotic customs. Not Lady Xenobia. Her eyes flared again, though she took a deep breath, clearly making a valiant effort to overcome her temper.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d No one contradicted him. Certainly not a woman.</p><p>That lush mouth of hers pressed into a flat line and she rose. Hell. That meant he too had to stand. His prick was still trying to burst his breeches, even though he was dueling with a she-devil.</p><p>\u201cI am withdrawing my request that you refurbish my house,\u201d he said. \u201cStarberry Court merely needs to be made habitable; it needn\u2019t be transformed into a residence fit for a duke.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, she was busy glaring at his face. \u201cYou are wrong, Mr. Dautry. If your house is not impeccably furnished and adequately staffed, Lady Rainsford will not agree to this betrothal, no matter how much money you have. What\u2019s more, the house is not your only challenge. It will take you at least a month to acquire a wardrobe that will persuade Laetitia\u2019s mother you are a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes swept over him, from hair to boots.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t appear to notice anything untoward\u2014other than his lack of a cravat and coat. \u201cYou should think of Starberry Court as a background that will disguise who you really are,\u201d she continued, seeming to discard the idea that he could conceal his true status with a new coat.</p><p>A man would probably spend a lifetime teasing her just to get that heated look in response. Thorn gave her a smile that\u2014he had been reliably told\u2014made women weak at the knees, and therefore was practically guaranteed to make her even more furious. \u201cDo tell me, Lady Xenobia: who exactly am I?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered. \u201cAre you attempting to intimidate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m merely attempting to clarify your thoughts on the subject. Because since I haven\u2019t managed to sack you\u2014not that I ever officially hired you\u2014I might as well know my new employee\u2019s opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with about as much warmth as you might expect from a wild boar. That was the way it was in the peerage: they were all man-eating carnivores, to his mind. Except his father. And Eleanor. And a few others.</p><p>\u201cFirst, Eleanor hired me, not you. And second, you are the bastard son of a duke,\u201d Lady Xenobia said bluntly, showing that she had balls, to put it equally bluntly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you realize that you are the first lady who has ever said the word \u2018bastard\u2019 aloud to me?\u201d</p><p>She looked him straight in the eye. \u201cThe word has more than one meaning.\u201d It seemed she applied at least two of those meanings to him.</p><p>Thorn grinned. \u201cAre all daughters of dukes like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the daughter of a marquess, not a duke. And precisely what are you implying?\u201d</p> <p>He saw over her shoulder that Iffley was helping Lady Adelaide with her pelisse. \u201cYou are the first person I have employed who refused to be let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am extremely fond of your stepmother. I promised her that I would help you, and I shall. Your parents are rightfully concerned about your prospects for a respectable marriage.\u201d</p><p>Thorn shrugged. He was fairly sure neither Eleanor nor Villiers gave a damn who he married. \u201cEleanor instructed me not to inquire about your fee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never discuss such matters,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cMy solicitor will contact yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lady, all right,\u201d he muttered. She had probably seen the bulge in his breeches without the faintest idea what it was.</p> <p>\u201cDo come, my dear,\u201d Lady Adelaide chirped from the doorway. \u201cI have several more calls to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall meet you at Starberry Court the day after tomorrow,\u201d Lady Xenobia said, chin in the air, as if she were Queen Elizabeth addressing Parliament. \u201cFirst thing in the morning, if you please, Mr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>She leaned a bit closer, lowering her voice. \u201c \u2018First thing in the morning\u2019 in this case will signify nine o\u2019clock, Mr. Dautry. Forgive me for the clarification, but I would guess that your evenings are quite . . . tiring.\u201d</p><p>She had seen his erection. And that throaty voice of hers only made him stiffer.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d she continued, \u201cI would suggest that you place yourself in the hands of Monsieur Devoulier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy that tailor in particular?\u201d Thorn drawled, thinking with some satisfaction of the various coats Devoulier had made for him over the years. He might not choose to dress like a peacock on a daily basis, but that didn\u2019t mean he hadn\u2019t the clothing to do so.</p> <p>\u201cHe excels in making shortfalls less obvious,\u201d she said coolly. And damned if she didn\u2019t glance at his crotch.</p><p>How in the hell did she think his cockstand would become less obvious? And did she think that he walked about like this all day? Actually, he might do so\u2014around her. Her folded arms were making her delectable bosom plump up like a present any man would beg to receive.</p><p>Iffley escorted the ladies out of the library, which gave Thorn time to admire Lady Xenobia\u2019s bottom before it was concealed by her pelisse. With a sigh, he looked down at his breeches.</p><p>As the front door closed, Lady Xenobia\u2019s actual words sank in: she had called his cockstand a \u201cshortfall.\u201d A shortfall? An involuntary bark of laughter erupted from his throat.</p><p>No woman\u2014lady or otherwise\u2014had ever complained about his tool. Lady Xenobia hadn\u2019t even seen it in the flesh.</p><p>That was tantamount to a dare.</p><p>And he had never refused a challenge in his life.</p><p>Chapter Five</p> <p>June 18, late morning</p><p>40, Hanover Square</p><p>London</p><p>I regret to interrupt you, Mr. Dautry, but a child has arrived.\u201d Iffley\u2019s voice had a sour ring, as if he were a classical actor forced to introduce a burlesque. \u201cBy special delivery,\u201d the butler added.</p><p>Thorn was wrestling with the design for a band of rubber, to be made at his new factory with all possible speed. He wanted it to be large enough and strong enough to secure a trunk on the top of a carriage, though he had no idea whether that was possible.</p><p>He scowled at his butler. \u201cIt\u2019s a misdirection. Get out.\u201d He had to do something about the band\u2019s elasticity, as well as rubber\u2019s tendency to melt in warm weather.</p><p>\u201cShe is accompanied by a letter addressed to you,\u201d Iffley replied with a sniff. He was endowed with a long, thin nose that gave him the air of a well-bred greyhound, and his sniff ably conveyed both reproach and disdain.</p><p>There was only one reason a strange child would show up, unbidden, at his doorstep. Yet it couldn\u2019t be a child of his. His father\u2019s lamentable example had made him vigilant in that respect. \u201cHow old is this child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be reluctant to guess at her age; my knowledge of such matters is negligible.\u201d</p><p>The man suffered from a folie de grandeur, in Thorn\u2019s estimation. Perhaps he would banish him to Starberry Court. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrederick is in charge of all deliveries,\u201d Iffley said, extending the letter on a silver tray. \u201cTherefore, she is at the service door, awaiting your instructions.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s eyes fell to the scrawled handwriting and his heart squeezed, then beat faster. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat bollocking arsehole.\u201d Even touching the envelope gave him a terrible feeling in his gut, like the time he ate a pickled herring with a greenish tinge. He\u2019d been too hungry to be put off by its peculiar taste.</p><p>\u201cBring the child,\u201d he said.</p><p>Iffley left and Thorn forced himself to look at the handwriting again. But he didn\u2019t open the letter, as if not reading it would somehow change the information he knew was inside.</p><p>Moments later, the door opened and the butler reentered, followed by one of his footmen, Frederick, who carried a little girl of perhaps three or four years. Her hands gripped Fred\u2019s lapel so tightly that her knuckles were white. Her face was hidden behind a tangled cloud of yellowish hair, and her legs looked pitifully thin.</p><p>Thorn took a deep breath and came from behind his desk. \u201cWell. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>Instead of an answer, a stifled whimper broke from the girl\u2019s mouth. The sound was infused with terror, and Thorn\u2019s chest tightened. He couldn\u2019t bear frightened children.</p><p>\u201cHere, open this and read it aloud.\u201d He handed the letter to his butler, then plucked the child from the footman\u2019s arms. \u201cFred, you may return to the entry. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>The little girl looked at him for a second; he had an impression of gray eyes and a thin face before she buried her head in his chest. Her bony little back curved against his arm.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he said, walking over to a sofa and sitting down, only belatedly remembering that one shouldn\u2019t curse in front of children. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer; he felt, more than heard, a sob shake her body.</p><p>Iffley cleared his throat. \u201cShall I summon the housekeeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust read the letter to me.\u201d Thorn curved his arms around the child so that she sat within a nest, tight against his chest. That had generally soothed his sisters, back in the first days after they\u2019d been rescued by their father and would wake up terrified night after night.</p><p>He too had been scared by the huge mansion and the odd, eccentric duke who had appeared out of nowhere, scooped him and five other children off the streets, and declared his paternity. After which His Grace had looked down his big nose and announced that his name was Tobias. It was a name he\u2019d never heard before, and he still didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Once Thorn turned out to be the eldest of the Duke of Villiers\u2019s rescued bastards, he rarely sat down without having a child, if not two, hanging on him, and the sensation of holding a small body on his lap came back immediately. He stroked the child\u2019s back and looked up to find Iffley staring at him, jaw slack. \u201cRead the damned letter, Iffley.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a crack as the wax seal broke, and Iffley cleared his throat. \u201cThere has indeed been some mistake, sir,\u201d he said, relief ringing in his voice. \u201cBelying the envelope, the salutation is not addressed to you.\u201d</p><p>But Thorn had the same warning feeling that led him to sell stocks when he met a business owner who was just a trifle too jovial, or one whose teeth shone in the candlelight. \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to Juby,\u201d he said, resigned.</p><p>Juby was his pre-rescue name, the name of a mudlark who had lived in the rough and scavenged in the Thames. Juby was, and was not, Mr. Tobias Dautry, the illegitimate son of the Duke of Villiers. And he was, and was not, Thorn Dautry, an extraordinarily wealthy bastard who owned six factories, a couple of houses, and now a country estate.</p><p>Now Thorn looked down with a pulse of sadness at the child huddled in his lap. Presumably, another of his band of boys had died. There had been seven mudlarks slaving under Grindel\u2014a rapacious, brutish master\u2014when Villiers had located Thorn. He had been taken to his father\u2019s country estate, and the duke had dispatched the other boys to good homes. Grindel had gone to prison.</p> <p>Even so, Fillibert had died that first year of a blood infection. Barty had gotten in a fight, struck his head on a cobblestone, and had never woken again. Rattles was gone the following year. After that, there had been five left, including himself.</p><p>There was an enduring bond between them, forged from surviving Grindel\u2019s cruelty, from risking death in the Thames, from coming close to starvation and frostbite more times than he cared to remember. Yet the only boy with whom he\u2019d become true friends was Will Summers. Like Thorn, Will was the illegitimate son of a nobleman, though his father had never acknowledged his baseborn son.</p><p>When they were lads, Will had hair like a duckling\u2019s fuzz, an odd yellow that would fluff up in the sunlight after they emerged, shivering, from the Thames, their hands full of scavenged treasures like silver spoons and human teeth\u2014whatever they could find and, more to the point, whatever their master could sell. Will was the stubborn one, persistent to the point of madness, diving into the murkiest water to chase a flash of silver.</p><p>Iffley cleared his throat again. \u201cIt is indeed addressed to \u2018Juby,\u2019 and signed \u2018William Summers.\u2019 The handwriting is unclear, and it has apparently been exposed to water. It begins, \u2018If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019ve lost . . .\u2019 but the latter half of the sentence is indecipherable. Something about the child follows. Her mother is apparently dead, then something about the Americas.\u201d He tipped the letter sideways and squinted. \u201cIt seems her mother died during her birth.\u201d</p><p>After Thorn, Will was the best educated: he had won a place at King\u2019s, and thereafter had gone into the militia. Which made it only more surprising that his daughter was alarmingly thin and distinctly unclean. She had an odd smell about her, like the inside of a tobacco pouch.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is her name?\u201d Thorn asked.</p><p>\u201cIt notes without reference to a proper name that his wife\u2019s sister lives in Virginia, in America. At least\u2014\u201d He caught himself.</p><p>Thorn gave him a grim smile. \u201cThe child is orphaned but not illegitimate, for which we must all offer hosannas. I was at the wedding, Iffley. It took place at St. Andrew\u2019s, with a lashing of ceremonial rigmarole. But I was asking for her name, not her aunt\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s thin back hunched, like a bird putting its head under a wing. She was listening, though she chose not to enter the conversation.</p><p>The butler squinted at the letter again. \u201cI don\u2019t see a name. From what I see here, you are the guardian and may choose to send the child to America if you wish. There\u2019s a bit in here about a silver teapot. Or the top to a silver teapot, which doesn\u2019t make any sense, followed by the name of his solicitor. I regret to say that the missive is abusive in nature. Summers addresses Juby as a \u2018fusty nut.\u2019 I believe he also says that he himself is \u2018ignorant as dirt,\u2019 but it could be that Juby is the object of that invective as well. And that\u2019s the entirety of the note.\u201d</p><p>Thorn nodded. \u201cSend a message to my solicitor asking him to find out what happened to Will Summers, member of the militia located in Meryton. And ask Mrs. Stella to attend me.\u201d He tightened his arms around Will\u2019s daughter and said gently, into her ear, \u201cWill you please tell me your name?\u201d</p> <p>The child burst into tears. Thorn sighed and stood up, scooping her into his arms. He hitched her a bit higher and followed Iffley into the entry. Frederick stood against the wall. \u201cI gather you accepted this special delivery, Fred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas a trunk delivered at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. And the driver took off so quickly that I scarcely had a look at him.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Stella burst through the servants\u2019 door, ribbons streaming from her cap. His housekeeper had gravity about her, a quality of being bound to the earth by more than the weight of her sturdy form. \u201cWell, who\u2019s this?\u201d she asked. \u201cCould it be I see a wee one in need of a bath?\u201d</p><p>There was one more sob, and the girl\u2019s head shook in violent refusal.</p><p>\u201cHow about a bowl of porridge?\u201d</p><p>Another shake.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always found that cake is very cheering,\u201d Thorn remarked.</p><p>Mrs. Stella sighed in an exaggerated way. \u201cWell, if you say so, sir. Cake it shall be.\u201d And she held out her arms.</p><p>No movement.</p><p>\u201cCake,\u201d Thorn repeated. \u201cMrs. Stella is a very nice woman, and the cake can only be found in her part of the house.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment, but the girl raised her head. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have cake only if you tell me your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy papa named me Rose,\u201d she said, her voice wavering for a moment.</p><p>Thorn put her down and she went to Mrs. Stella, stopping to look up at her. \u201cI don\u2019t, in the general course of things, like to be carried,\u201d she said, her voice piping but quite clear.</p><p>Mrs. Stella smiled and said, \u201cYou will have no argument from me. I shouldn\u2019t like to be carried myself.\u201d They set off through the servants\u2019 door, Thorn frowning after them. Will\u2019s daughter had a most peculiar manner. As if she were ninety years old and a dowager duchess to boot.</p><p>He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d ship Rose off to America. His father had misplaced all his illegitimate children after consigning them to the care of an unscrupulous solicitor. No, if the aunt wanted Rose, she would have to come to England and fetch her.</p><p>But what the devil was he to do with the girl until her aunt arrived, even supposing they could find the woman? Rose couldn\u2019t live in his house, no matter how birdlike and\u2014</p><p>No.</p><p>Thorn went back to his desk and sat down before the design for his rubber band. Even as he worked, though, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Rose. At length he realized that the easiest solution was to give her to his stepmother, Eleanor. It would hardly matter if the ton believed that the Duke of Villiers had spawned yet another bastard.</p><p>In fact, he could ask her directly; he had just time enough to stop by his father\u2019s town house before meeting Vander for supper. He\u2019d gone straight to his study from a vigorous ride and he smelled like the stables, so he went upstairs to his bedchamber and rang for his valet.</p><p>An hour later, he was bathed and had shrugged on a coat as elegant as any the Duke of Villiers had worn. The choice had nothing to do with the way Lady Xenobia\u2019s lip had curled when she\u2019d looked him over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mere thought of her brought on another irrational flare of desire. Damn it, the woman was the daughter of a marquess. When he\u2019d reached manhood, his father had told him not to look at women in the highest ranks. A cat couldn\u2019t look at a king, after all, nor a bastard at a marquess\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d been looking at Xenobia.</p><p>Though she had looked at him.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Thorn returned downstairs after bathing, thinking that he\u2019d better see how Mrs. Stella was faring and tell Iffley to send for a Bow Street Runner. He needed someone to investigate what had happened to Will, not to mention what had happened to his daughter\u2019s clothing.</p><p>It turned out that his new ward had been bathed and fed, and put down to nap in the nursery, a room he had heretofore ignored.</p><p>\u201cI was able to find her a little black gown that fit with just a tuck or two,\u201d Mrs. Stella reported. \u201cI have her measurements, and I\u2019ve ordered a proper wardrobe, which should be delivered in a week. You\u2019ll have to hire a governess as soon as you can, Mr. Dautry. And a nursemaid, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you see to the nursemaid, Mrs. Stella? And tell the agency that I\u2019d like to interview governesses. Not tomorrow, as I\u2019ll take Rose with me to Starberry Court, but the following morning. Where\u2019s Iffley?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Stella\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cMr. Iffley was quite perturbed by the child\u2019s arrival. I could not speak to his whereabouts.\u201d</p> <p>Bloody hell. Thorn had the feeling that the agency would have to look for butlers as well. \u201cAsk Fred to send him to me in the library.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Iffley had been packing his bags. \u201cI have compromised my standards enough,\u201d he stated, his tone so sour it could have curdled milk. \u201cAfter giving it some thought, Mr. Dautry, I realized that it matters little whether that child upstairs is yours or another\u2019s. The scandal will envelop you both, and the disgrace will extend far beyond the walls of this house.\u201d</p><p>Thorn resisted the impulse to take the supercilious jackass out with a blow to the jaw.</p><p>Iffley required no response. \u201cI am one, sir, who prefers to have the distinctions of rank preserved. I compromised my own standards by taking this post; it is with no small amount of shame that I have confessed the same to myself. My eyes are opened to my own ignominy.\u201d He clasped his hands, looking to the heavens with an expression of utmost anguish.</p><p>Thorn stopped being irritated and started grinning. It wasn\u2019t often that one had a private farce performed at no cost in such intimate surroundings.</p><p>He sent Iffley away and ran back upstairs to see Rose. When he looked in the door of the nursery, she opened her eyes, which were large and framed by curling eyelashes. Not that they made her pretty, not with the grayish cast to her skin and the way her eyebrows cut across her eyes as straight as the flight of an arrow. She sat up as he walked into the room.</p> <p>\u201cI must go out this evening,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rose\u2019s lower lip trembled, but she said nothing and laid her head on her knees.</p><p>\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d he said, feeling a twinge of guilt. \u201cOne cannot take a child to a gentleman\u2019s club.\u201d</p><p>A tear caught the light as it slid over the curve of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he said, abandoning his intention not to swear in her presence. He sat down on her bed. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you got a doll? When I was growing up, my sisters dragged dolls with them wherever they went.\u201d</p><p>Rose didn\u2019t lift her head, and her voice was muffled by her knees. \u201cMr. Pancras says that there is no useful purpose to a doll. They grow dusty very quickly. He believes that acquiring accomplishments such as Greek is a better use of one\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Pancras, whoever he is, sounds like an ass,\u201d Thorn said. He glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ve just time to find you a doll before the shops close.\u201d</p><p>Rose sat up directly. \u201cBut the ribbon broke on my right slipper and Mrs. Stella said I can\u2019t go outside until I have new shoes.\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, there was a very tired-looking pair of slippers next to the bed, one of which had only half a ribbon. Thorn helped her from the bed, slipped them on her feet, and tied a knot instead of a bow around Rose\u2019s thin ankle, which she viewed with evident disfavor.</p><p>He stood, and she looked up at him. She did not hold out her arms, but it seemed he was expected to pick her up.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you announce that you don\u2019t like to be carried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make exceptions when I am ill shod.\u201d</p><p>The child stared back at Thorn as if there was nothing odd about her speech. He gathered her up into his arms and remarked, \u201cAt least you smell better now.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down in time to see cool gray eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thorn stared down at her. Had she? Yes, she had. \u201cThat was not a polite comment,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She looked off, into the corner of the bedchamber, but her implication was obvious: he had been impolite to point out her former odor.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for mentioning your condition. How old are you?\u201d he asked, with real curiosity.</p><p>Another silence ensued, as if she was debating whether to answer. At last she said, \u201cI shall be six very soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost six! I thought you were three. Or four at most.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him again. Silently.</p><p>\u201cMy father will like you,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>Her nose tilted slightly in the air, and she did not deign to answer.</p><p>\u201cYou are a mystery,\u201d Thorn said, now striding toward the stairs. \u201cYou sound as if you\u2019ve had a governess. But you\u2019re deplorably thin, and you have no clothing. Generally speaking, those things are difficult to reconcile with the having of a governess. Of course, there are always exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had a governess,\u201d Rose announced with a crushing air of condescension. \u201cMr. Pancras was my tutor.\u201d</p><p>They had reached the entryway. Thorn took his coat and Rose\u2019s shabby pelisse from Fred (Iffley having taken himself off for good), carried Rose outside, and deposited her in his carriage.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met your aunt?\u201d he asked, once they were underway.</p><p>\u201cNo. As Papa informed you in his letter, she lives in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all accounts, that\u2019s a marvelous place, full of bison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn animal larger than an ox, and much shaggier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am uninterested in bisons,\u201d Rose observed. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t like to live in America. Papa said that the ocean was perilous, and that my mother\u2019s sister was a whittie-whattie twaddle-head.\u201d</p><p>At that moment Thorn was struck by the conviction that he was never going to let Rose anywhere near the land of bison. Nor was he going to hand her to Eleanor, as if she were a piece of unwanted china. He was thinking about what that meant for his life when she asked, \u201cHave you traveled to America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not. You are very fluent for a nearly six-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa said I have an old soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You have a very young soul, to go with that lisp of yours.\u201d</p><p>At this, her eyes narrowed and a little bit of pink stole into her cheeks. \u201cI do not lisp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d It was very slight\u2014but rather enchanting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned her sharp little nose into the air. \u201cIf I lisped, Mr. Pancras would have taught me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you have a governess?\u201d Will had always been peculiar, but it sounded as if marriage, or being widowed, had made him even more so.</p><p>\u201cPapa believed that women added unnecessary complications to a household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo nursemaid?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cThe kitchen maid helped me dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Pancras? Or, to ask the same question another way, why did you arrive by special delivery, and why were you dirty and thin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father said that in the event of tribulation or strife, I was to be sent to you.\u201d She stopped again.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Tribulation\u2019?\u201d Thorn leaned back against the carriage seat. He was used to clever children. Hell, all six of his siblings could talk circles around most Oxford graduates. But it could be that Rose took the cake. \u201cDo you know how to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve been reading ever since I was born.\u201d</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow, and she stiffened.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Pancras?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy did he not bring you himself, and why have you no belongings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t bring me. He had to take the first appointment that was offered to him, in Yorkshire. There was a delivery going from the brewery to London, and it cost much less for my fare than it would have on the mail coach. Plus my trunk went at no cost. I\u2019m afraid that Papa had very little money when he died; Mr. Pancras said that he was a spendthrift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father didn\u2019t make enough money in the militia to permit extravagance,\u201d Thorn told her, making a mental note to send another Bow Street Runner after Pancras and, when he\u2019d been turned up, to send him on a boat to China, special delivery. \u201cSo you were sent along with the beer.\u201d</p><p>Rose nodded. \u201cThe journey look longer than Mr. Pancras had thought it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your clothing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we reached your house, the driver left quickly, and he forgot about my trunk. It was strapped under the barrels. He was quite unkind and wouldn\u2019t bring it down at night. I had to sleep in my dress.\u201d</p><p>A second Runner to find Rose\u2019s trunk. \u201cHow long was the journey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d</p><p>Thorn felt fury smoldering in his gut. \u201cThree days? Where did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe driver allowed me to sleep in the wagon,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t entirely proper, but I thought that Papa would tell me not to fuss. Did you know that when he was little, Papa occasionally slept outside, under the stars?\u201d</p><p>Occasionally? He and Will had spent a couple of years sleeping in a church graveyard because their bloody-minded master wouldn\u2019t let them inside except in the dead of winter. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did not fuss, and neither did I,\u201d said Rose, and up went that little nose again. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be unclean, and I didn\u2019t care for the insects living in the straw. But I did not complain.\u201d</p><p>Thorn nodded.</p> <p>\u201cOr cry. At least,\u201d she added, \u201cuntil I reached your house, when I succumbed to exhaustion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou succumbed?\u201d Thorn took a deep breath. \u201cWhen you first arrived this morning, you didn\u2019t say a word. Do you know that I considered the idea that you might be unable to speak altogether?\u201d</p><p>That won the very first smile he\u2019d seen on her face.</p><p>\u201cI talk too much,\u201d she informed him. \u201cThat\u2019s what Papa always says\u2014said.\u201d Her face crumpled, and smoothed over so quickly that he almost missed it.</p><p>\u201cYou might feel better if you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall not, because it would make him feel sad, even in heaven.\u201d</p><p>Thorn frowned, not at all sure how to untangle that.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I needn\u2019t cry. I am not alone and I don\u2019t have to sleep under the stars. I have you in case of tribulation. I\u2019m lucky,\u201d she said stoutly. But a tear ran down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better come over here,\u201d he said, holding out an arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this is a time of tribulation.\u201d</p><p>They drove the rest of the way to a store called Noah\u2019s Ark, Rose nestled under his arm. After a while, Thorn handed over his handkerchief.</p><p>The shop turned out to be a wonderful place, crammed with not only dolls but also toy boats, toy carriages with real wheels, and whole regiments of tin soldiers.</p><p>The owner, Mr. Hamley, surveyed the two of them and apparently recognized instantly that while Rose looked like a tattered little crow, Thorn planned to buy her whatever she wished. Consequently, he began treating Rose like one of the royal princesses.</p><p>As Hamley introduced Rose to the very best dolls to be found in all England (according to him), Thorn wandered away and discovered the wooden balls meant for playing croquet. He picked one up, tested its weight, tossed it from hand to hand. It would be interesting to try to make a rubber ball. It might even be possible to make it bounce. . . .</p><p>He was thinking about that when Rose came to fetch him. She had found the perfect doll, with real hair, bright blue eyes, and movable joints. \u201cI shall call her Antigone,\u201d Rose told him.</p><p>It seemed like an odd name to Thorn, but what did he know? He distinctly remembered that his sister Phoebe had a girl doll she named Fergus.</p><p>Twilight was falling by the time Rose selected an appropriate wardrobe for her new doll. Antigone had a morning dress for making calls, a velvet evening dress, and a riding habit with cunning tiny buttons running up the front in a double row. She had a soft woolen pelisse that was nearly the same green as Rose\u2019s, a nightdress, and a little pile of undergarments that included knitted stockings as gossamer as cobwebs. Plus an umbrella.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a presentation gown?\u201d Mr. Hamley asked. He opened a special box lined in white silk. Inside was a white gown that came with several ruffled petticoats and a set of hoops that would make Antigone absurdly wide. It was swagged in white lace and embroidered with tiny dangling pearls.</p><p>Rose gasped and reached out a finger to touch the satin. But she firmly shook her head. \u201cIt would be wasteful to own a gown that was worn only to meet the queen.\u201d</p><p>Thorn crouched down and said, \u201cSweetheart, your father gave you to me because I have more money than I know what to do with. Do you think that Antigone would like to be presented to the queen?\u201d</p><p>Rose nodded.</p><p>There were no more tears on the way home, and Rose happily danced away to introduce Antigone to Mrs. Stella and the upstairs maid, who would serve as nursemaid until they hired one.</p><p>The next morning in the carriage Rose said, with a distinct ring of defiance in her voice, \u201cAntigone and I would have been perfectly happy spending the day with Fred. I dislike the country.\u201d</p><p>In fact, Antigone did appear to be regarding Thorn with a very impertinent expression, but he merely said, \u201cUntil we find a governess, you will go wherever I go, and I need to pay a visit to Starberry Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it quite incomprehensible that I should accompany you. Children are to be seen and not heard. Everyone knows that.\u201d Rose removed her doll\u2019s pelisse, drew a tiny sheet of foolscap from her pocket, and propped it up on Antigone\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she reading?\u201d Thorn inquired. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAntigone has begun a regime of studying Greek verbs for three hours each day.

Ancient Greek is no longer spoken.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy waste her time?\u201d</p> <p>She had settled Antigone\u2019s paper into place and drawn out a small leather-bound volume for herself. \u201cNeither of us are wasting our time. I would prefer to learn things, even useless things, than do nothing. Would you like me to teach you Greek? Mr. Pancras told me that all gentlemen know the language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>She looked him up and down. \u201cI can see that you are not,\u201d she observed. \u201cBut perhaps if you knew Greek, you would be able to become a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Rose nodded and returned to her book.</p> <p>And Thorn found himself staring down at the design for a rubber-stretching machine with the edges of his mouth curled up.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Starberry Court</p><p>Near West Drayton, Middlesex</p><p>The carriage rounded the circular gravel drive and drew to a halt. Adelaide had fallen asleep somewhere along the way, so India touched her knee gently and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Her godmother opened her eyes and burst directly into speech. \u201cThe den of iniquity! Did I tell you that Jupp asked me to dance once, when I debuted? My mother declined on my behalf, of course. He already had a reputation as a libertine.\u201d</p> <p>India gathered her reticule. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the house doesn\u2019t show too much evidence of his debauchery.\u201d She glanced from the window as she waited for their groom to open the door. They had been following Mr. Dautry\u2019s carriage for some miles, and now he was stepping down from his carriage. She had forgotten how tall he was. Once again he wasn\u2019t wearing a coat, and his waistcoat emphasized the absurd width of his shoulders. Dark hair tumbled over his collar, because he wore no hat. And he hadn\u2019t a cravat either.</p><p>Hopefully he had summoned Monsieur Devoulier, because unless he began wearing a coat at the very least, it wouldn\u2019t matter if she covered Starberry Court in gold leaf: Lady Rainsford would never marry her daughter to a man who dressed like a common laborer.</p><p>As she stepped from the carriage, she watched, astonished, as Dautry held out his hands and swung a little girl down to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWas Mr. Dautry previously married?\u201d India asked Adelaide, sotto voce.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Adelaide said, clambering down from the carriage and adding, \u201cGoodness!\u201d once she looked in his direction.</p><p>Dautry\u2019s bow wasn\u2019t as dismissive as it had been when they\u2019d first met. Still, it was the bow not of a courtier but of an assassin: a gesture with edge, with deadly grace.</p><p>\u201cLady Adelaide and Lady Xenobia, may I present my ward, Miss Rose Summers?\u201d</p><p>The child dropped a quite respectable curtsy. Who in the world was the girl and, for that matter, where was her governess? It wasn\u2019t as if Mr. Dautry couldn\u2019t afford one.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you do, Miss Rose?\u201d Adelaide asked, stooping to smile at her.</p><p>\u201cI am very well, thank you,\u201d she replied, in a manner remarkably composed for one so young. \u201cIt is an honor to meet you, Lady Adelaide.\u201d She turned slightly and curtsied again. \u201cAnd Lady Xenobia.\u201d</p><p>India met gray eyes as cool as pond water, and her heart sank. Those eyes were unmistakable. It seemed that Villiers\u2019s bastard son was following his example and raising a child born out of wedlock under his own roof. Lady Rainsford would not approve.</p><p>Her mind was whirling, so she turned to survey the house. Starberry Court was a charming old mansion built of brick the color of clover honey, with six gabled roofs, numerous stone balconies, and mullioned glass windows. At one time, there had been elaborate gardens, but now high grass brushed the lowest windowsills. The drive still traced a gracious circle, but its gravel was punctuated by small white flowers growing here and there.</p><p>\u201cAre there no servants at all?\u201d she asked, her misgivings growing by the moment.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it. The estate agent didn\u2019t mention any retainers.\u201d Dautry began walking toward the door, pulling a large iron key from his pocket, the child trotting beside him to keep up with his long stride.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry!\u201d India said firmly.</p><p>He and Rose turned in unison, and she looked into two pairs of eyes staring at her with identical impatient expressions.</p><p>For a moment, India couldn\u2019t even find words. Was he foolish enough to think that Lady Rainsford would accept the presence of a baseborn child in the household? No amount of money would quiet that scandal. None.</p><p>Even Villiers, the highest in the land, had been shunned by sticklers who felt his bastards should not have been thrust on society. And Mr. Dautry, needless to say, was no duke. Even if Lady Rainsford allowed the marriage, he and Lala would be rebuffed by all but close family.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry, I believe we should have another discussion about your expectations for the house party,\u201d India said finally. It was unnerving to find that she was not able to read his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEleanor told me that you would take care of everything. If you can\u2019t, I should like to know immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you truly buy this house sight unseen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always need things repeated, Lady Xenobia?\u201d The way he drawled her title made the comment even more irritating. \u201cI am quite sure that I mentioned that two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I had no idea that the estate was in such neglected condition,\u201d she said, trying to decide how to address the larger problem.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we need to hire a gardener. Or ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no staff whatsoever? I must hire everyone?\u201d</p><p>Dautry raised his free hand and ran it through his thick hair. It sparked black, like the underside of a raven\u2019s wing, and revealed the white streak identical to the duke\u2019s. When he dropped his hand, his hair tumbled back into place and the streak disappeared. \u201cIf I had the staff, why would I need you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need her. He needed an estate manager, a housekeeper, a butler. Servants. A wife. And he should have married that wife years ago, so that Rose had a proper family.</p><p>\u201cWe seem to have misunderstood each other,\u201d India said, trying to stop her voice from rising. \u201cI don\u2019t build whole households. I assess the weak points in staff, dismiss some people and hire others. My people will refurbish walls and floors, but generally we do a room or two at most. I had no idea your house was completely abandoned, without any servants whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>The impatience she\u2019d seen in his eyes flared. \u201cUnfortunately, my butler in London proved an arsehole, and I let him go. I can\u2019t dispatch him to help you.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s temper blazed up. \u201cYou should not swear in front of your daughter!\u201d she snapped, the single, complicated word tumbling out before she could think better of it.</p><p>In the silence that followed, a bird trilled. India\u2019s muscles tensed, her body instinctively preparing to run for the carriage in response to the murderous look in Dautry\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDaughter? He is not my father,\u201d Rose said at the same moment that Dautry snarled, \u201cRose is my ward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A stunned heartbeat passed before Adelaide chirped, \u201cOh Mr. Dautry, you do remember how you mistook Lady Xenobia for a hired companion? And now she has mistaken Miss Rose for something closer than a ward. Such mistakes do happen!\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s heart was beating so fast that she felt dizzy. No matter how she fought it, her temper always seemed to get the better of her. \u201cI apologize for my error.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Mr. Dautry would make a very good father,\u201d the little girl said unexpectedly. She tucked her hand into his again.</p><p>India felt her face soften. \u201cI am truly sorry, Miss Rose. I didn\u2019t mean . . . well, I misunderstood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to apologize,\u201d she said with dignity. \u201cI like Mr. Dautry very much. In fact, I am going to teach him Greek, and how to dance, and he will be better off.\u201d</p><p>If India had held any advantage over Dautry before, she had just lost it. She had the sudden conviction that if she showed the slightest weakness, Dautry would squash her like an unwelcome fly at the breakfast table. \u201cHow fortunate,\u201d she said, turning to him. \u201cI shall look forward to seeing the results of this Pygmalion endeavor.\u201d</p><p>Pure fury burned in the depths of Dautry\u2019s eyes. He bent and scooped up Rose. \u201cI would be honored if you were my daughter,\u201d he told her, turning away slightly so that the two of them had privacy. \u201cBut I know that Will was very happy to have been your papa, and I wish he were standing here with you right now.\u201d</p><p>India took a deep breath. She had been an idiot. Dautry was an arsehole, to use his own expression. But in the utter absence of any facts, she\u2019d had no right to leap to that or any other conclusion, and even worse, to allow the words to tumble out in front of the child.</p><p>What\u2019s more, now she couldn\u2019t simply walk to her carriage and drive away. She supposed that Rose must have entered Dautry\u2019s life in the last few days\u2014which meant that the child had only just lost her father. How could she not have registered her mourning garment? Presumably she had lost her mother too.</p> <p>Suddenly the missing pieces fell into place. This was why Thorn believed Lala would make the perfect wife. She would. Lala would be an excellent mother to an orphaned little girl. Lala was just the kind of woman who would take a child in need under her wing, give her a home, love her.</p><p>Given that, how could India not do her own part?</p><p>She would renovate the house and stay for the party, just long enough to make certain that the betrothal went smoothly. She would do it for Eleanor, and for Lala. And because Rose needed a mother. And\u2014not least\u2014because she was ashamed of herself.</p><p>As Dautry continued to speak quietly to his ward, India moved closer to the house. Happily, the mortar was in decent repair. One window appeared to be cracked, but it was in the servants\u2019 quarters and hopefully hadn\u2019t resulted in much water damage. The lawns and gardens were overgrown, but a squadron of gardeners could bring them back to a sufficiently civilized state within a week, and something quite beautiful by the date of the house party.</p><p>She began the mental list that would dictate her life for the immediate future. She would send her groom back to London immediately to summon her staff. And she\u2019d send a letter to her favorite employment bureau, informing them that she would need twenty, or perhaps even thirty, people.</p><p>She had walked to the corner of the house and was peering down the hill at what appeared to be a dilapidated folly when she heard someone approaching. She turned to find Dautry striding toward her. Behind him, Rose was showing a doll to Adelaide.</p> <p>He had a loose-limbed way of walking that signaled\u2014in her estimation\u2014that Greek would have no effect on his status as a gentleman. He would never be one. But she doubted Lala would care: he was one of the most handsome men India had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d he stated, coming to a halt.</p><p>Earlier she had thought his eyes inscrutable, but not now. They were still outraged. \u201cMr. Dautry, I apologize again for presuming that Rose was your daughter,\u201d she said.</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cYour error\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off with the same decisiveness with which she might counter an indignant butler. \u201cMy error had to do with the fact that your eyes are remarkably similar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see how such a common eye color would lead to such an error, but it is irrelevant. As you say, your talent lies in refurbishing a room or two, and I have an entire house to staff and furnish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has been the limits of my experience to this date,\u201d she stated, holding his gaze. \u201cHowever, I shall renovate this house and find servants for you in the next three weeks so that you can host a party including the Rainsfords, as well as your parents. I shall remain at Starberry Court for one week thereafter, and make absolutely certain that your betrothal comes to pass without Lady Rainsford\u2019s mounting a strong objection.\u201d</p><p>His reply was a string of words she\u2019d overheard on the street but had never heard said in her presence.</p> <p>She waited him out\u2014precisely as she would an incensed butler.</p><p>At last he said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d India said. \u201cI thought I would have to wait for you to learn Greek before you could express yourself in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can express myself,\u201d he said, his eyes narrowed. \u201cJust so we don\u2019t misunderstand each other, Lady Xenobia, I have no need of you.\u201d</p><p>India summoned every bit of self-control she had to keep her voice even. \u201cLady Rainsford will not permit you to marry Laetitia without my help, particularly after she meets Rose. I will not be the only one to mistake the child for your daughter. Rose will have to remain in London during the house party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>India frowned at him. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe spent three days in a beer cart on the way to London. I refuse to allow her to feel lost or neglected again. She remains with me.\u201d</p><p>India froze, her heart thumping at the idea of the little girl traveling in such a manner. \u201cAnything could have happened to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am well aware of that.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI am very distressed to hear about your ward\u2019s arrival, but I feel compelled to tell you that while Lady Rainsford may overlook your unfortunate birth, she will not countenance the marriage if she has the faintest suspicion that Rose is yours. And she will have that suspicion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ward has yellow hair,\u201d Dautry said, folding his arms. \u201cMine is black. She hasn\u2019t the faintest resemblance to me.\u201d</p><p>Against her will, India felt a pulse of sympathy for him. \u201cIt\u2019s her manner,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think it would be fair to say that you and she view the world the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what way is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom an invisible throne.\u201d</p><p>He was still furious, but he clearly had little trouble controlling his temper. \u201cIf that is the case, and Laetitia\u2019s mother disallows a betrothal, I shall look elsewhere for a wife. To resort to a proverb, there are many fish in the sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t time to look for another wife,\u201d India said just as bluntly. \u201cYou must marry Laetitia before people realize your ward has a distinct likeness to you. Once gossip spreads about Rose, you will be unmarriageable, in my opinion. I would suggest a special license.\u201d</p><p>Thorn was in the grip of a violent wave of disbelief. Had he previously thought Xenobia a she-devil? The names that came to mind now were far more violent. \u201cAre you to accompany me on my honeymoon as well?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill I be allowed to bed my wife without instruction?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damned if that didn\u2019t provoke a mocking little smile from her, reminding him that she considered him to have a shortfall in his private parts. \u201cNaturally, you will have all my best wishes for your success,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>As he opened his mouth to say a few choice words that he would likely regret, Rose skipped up and slipped her hand into his. \u201cShall we see the house now, Mr. Dautry?\u201d</p><p>He would be happy to convince the she-devil just how well he could succeed. But he clenched his teeth instead and again took out the key he\u2019d been given by his solicitors.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone lived here since Lord Jupp died?\u201d Lady Xenobia walked ahead of him, sounding as cool as if the air hadn\u2019t sizzled between them a moment earlier.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Thorn said, grimly registering that battling with her had perversely made his cock spring to action\u2014and he\u2019d left his bloody coat in the carriage. Again. \u201cI bought the house with all contents intact. Hopefully, the furniture merely needs dusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a good six months,\u201d Lady Adelaide said cheerfully, trotting over to join them.</p><p>The oaken door was large and heavy, with stubborn hinges. Thorn was forced to throw his shoulder against it until it swung open with a creaking noise and a rush of dusty old air. They all stepped forward as light flooded the entry hall.</p><p>A moment later Thorn snatched up his ward and headed straight back out of the house, his hand clapped over her eyes.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>The Earl of Jupp had adorned his entry hall with statues.</p><p>Of naked people.</p><p>Copulating.</p><p>India had never seen a copulation before (if that was the correct use of that noun\u2014was it a noun?), but she knew enough to be certain that these statues depicted variations on the act she\u2019d heard described. Just inside the door, for example, was a group of two women and one man, their naked bodies so entwined it was hard to see whose limb belonged to whom. What\u2019s more, they were standing, instead of lying down, and there was no bed to be seen.</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary,\u201d Adelaide said, fanning herself. \u201cI\u2019m almost sorry that my mother didn\u2019t allow that dance with Jupp. One has to wonder whether he had these done from life.\u201d She moved around the side of a horizontal piece featuring two people carved from a single block of marble.</p><p>\u201cThe men do not look English,\u201d India said, feeling somewhat proud of the fact that she\u2019d even noticed their facial features.</p> <p>\u201cProbably Greek,\u201d Adelaide said. She peered at a bronze statue. \u201cDo you know, I think there\u2019s a chance that this piece is by Cellini?\u201d</p><p>India hadn\u2019t the faintest idea who Cellini was. Was a \u201cpiece\u201d still a statue when there was more than one person involved? Or was that a \u201ccomposition\u201d?</p><p>She moved to stand beside Adelaide, who was staring at a naked man from the back. His legs were extraordinarily hairy. And he had a tail.</p><p>India wrinkled her nose. \u201cIs that supposed to be a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be prudish, darling,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than an English lady who doesn\u2019t appreciate art, particularly an exquisite bronze dating from the 1500s. The hooves and tail suggest he\u2019s a satyr.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a satyr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf-man, half-goat, from Greek mythology. My governess didn\u2019t teach me much about satyrs, because they are invariably naughty.\u201d She took a quizzing glass from her reticule, bent over, and peered at the base. \u201cThat looks very like Cellini\u2019s mark.\u201d</p><p>The goat man had a beautiful back, muscled in a way that India imagined few English gentlemen\u2019s were. And although she probably shouldn\u2019t look, his behind was very attractively shaped. Rounded, one might say. And muscled.</p> <p>\u201cBenvenuto Cellini was one of the most famous sculptors in Renaissance Italy,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cMy husband spent a terrible amount of money on a silver salver depicting Neptune. Naked, of course, so it couldn\u2019t be used even among friends.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>The late Lord Swift had been prone to extravagant decisions. Luckily for Adelaide, he died before he could lay waste to the entire estate.</p><p>The satyr was not alone. He was embracing a damsel, one arm curved around her waist and the other flung in the air, curving over their heads.</p><p>They were kissing.</p><p>His lover wore no more clothes than did he.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness your mother didn\u2019t raise you to be straitlaced, as you\u2019d likely faint at this,\u201d Adelaide commented, taking a closer look at the way the two figures clung to each other.</p><p>It was true that India\u2019s mother had favored dancing naked in the moonlight over instruction in ladylike behavior. At any rate, the sculpture made her feel more feverish than faint.</p><p>\u201cI think the satyr is actually the god Bacchus,\u201d her godmother continued. \u201cDo you see that grapevine around his forehead? Or a follower of Bacchus, because it seems to me that the god didn\u2019t have hooves.\u201d</p><p>India was more interested in the fact that she couldn\u2019t see below his chest in the front: the satyr and his beloved blended together below the waist.</p><p>Adelaide strolled away to inspect a female nude leaning against a surprisingly large bird. \u201cThis is presumably Leda and the swan. Do you suppose that Mr. Dautry was aware that these statues came with the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea.\u201d The sunlight darkened for a moment as Dautry walked through the door. \u201cI damn well wouldn\u2019t have brought Rose with me. I\u2019ve put the coachman in charge of her, but I can\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>Adelaide began chattering to him about Cellini, and India drew out a piece of foolscap and a pencil and began making a list of the statues, the better to ignore the silly, craving ache that the satyr\u2019s kiss had aroused.</p><p>It was ridiculous.</p><p>Absurd.</p><p>That whole conversation outside with Dautry hadn\u2019t helped. She had never seen a man flaunt an erection the way he was doing\u2014again. Adelaide had made certain that India recognized the signs of male arousal, if only so that no man could surprise her unawares.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t known that men were regularly lecherous. In fact they likely wore long coats just to disguise the fact. The thought of Dibbleshire\u2019s breeches drifted through her mind; she shuddered and pushed the image away.</p><p>There were ten statues in all. She waited for a pause in Adelaide\u2019s lecture about Renaissance sculpture, then asked, \u201cDo you wish to keep these pieces, Mr. Dautry?\u201d</p><p>He was standing before Leda, who had very large breasts and looked merry, as if swans were just her cup of tea. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll keep this one,\u201d he murmured. But then he glanced sideways at India. He was trying to shock her, the way little boys did when they dropped their breeches.</p><p>\u201cShe looks like a village barmaid,\u201d she said indifferently. \u201cI find the satyr far more interesting.\u201d</p><p>Dautry pivoted and gave the bronze statue a good long stare. India looked again too. The satyr\u2019s hand was curved above his lover in a gesture both exuberant and protective. Unwillingly, she felt another pulse of warmth.</p><p>\u201cIf they were both female, I would,\u201d Dautry said, with a wicked grin.</p><p>He was trying to provoke her again, and she refused to give him the satisfaction of appearing scandalized. \u201cShall we consign the statues to the barn, and you can decide their fate some other time?\u201d</p><p>Adelaide turned around, frowning. \u201cDarling, you can\u2019t mean to imply that you will actually attempt to put the house to rights. India has never done anything like this,\u201d she told Dautry, gesturing about. \u201cHer services are more like those of a wife. A temporary wife.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His smile deepened.</p><p>\u201cBarring any intimacies, of course!\u201d Adelaide cried.</p><p>India rolled her eyes. \u201cMr. Dautry, I assure you that my clients do not think of me as a wife, temporary or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s probably why they\u2019re always falling on their knees before you, waving a ring,\u201d her godmother said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pay through the nose for a wife,\u201d Dautry said, looking very amused. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem extraordinary that I would have to pay for a provisional one first. According to my solicitor, you charge a sum larger than many dowries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d Adelaide said, nodding. \u201cFrom the moment that darling India decided to help people in a formal way, as it were, she determined that her services had to be seen as an extravagance, or she would not be treated with the respect she deserved.\u201d</p><p>India decided to ignore this unhelpful exchange. She opened the first door to her left and entered a large drawing room. Its moth-eaten damask curtains had fallen to the floor, and only a few pieces of ramshackle furniture stood against the walls.</p><p>\u201cDamned disappointing,\u201d Dautry said, following her into the room. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing very scandalous to be seen here at all.\u201d</p><p>India turned in a circle. The sofa and all the chairs would have to go straight to the dust heap, along with the generations of mice homesteading within. But the writing desk against the wall needed little more than a good polish to be restored to itself.</p> <p>\u201cThe proportions of this room are divine,\u201d Adelaide said, poking at some paneling that had buckled from the wall.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I am not going to be able to make a complete tour of the house, since Rose is waiting for me. Lady Xenobia, can you speculate from the condition of this room whether you could transform the house into a background that will disguise the real me?\u201d Dautry asked.</p><p>\u201cI can transform the house, but not you,\u201d India replied.</p><p>His response made Adelaide\u2019s forehead crease. \u201cMy dear Mr. Dautry, you\u2019ll have to curb your language. Laetitia\u2019s mother won\u2019t care for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should delay those Greek lessons,\u201d India said, keeping her voice sincere. \u201cJust until you learn enough English to express yourself properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you never curse,\u201d Dautry said, a distinct hint of provocation in his voice.</p> <p>She was getting to know his measure now: he found her amusing. And not when she thought she was being witty, either.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry may not have had all the advantages one would wish,\u201d Adelaide said earnestly, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s less of a gentleman. Why, some of the most gentlemanly men rise from nothing. My butler, for example.\u201d</p><p>Dautry was terrifyingly attractive when he grinned; a dimple indented one cheek. Who would have thought such a forbidding man would have a dimple?</p><p>Without noticing, Adelaide rattled on about her butler and his exquisite manners. He never took the Lord\u2019s name in vain. \u201cAt least, I\u2019ve never heard him do so, and I can\u2019t imagine that he would.\u201d India, having hired him, was quite sure of that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late for me to learn that lesson,\u201d Dautry said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ll have to curtail this investigation of the property, because Rose has been in the care of my coachman long enough. Lady Xenobia, I believe that Lady Adelaide would prefer you didn\u2019t take on Starberry Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Adelaide, but I have already agreed to do it,\u201d India said, adding, \u201cand I shall not fail.\u201d That sentence came out with a bite. The only time she had done so was after she\u2019d had to ward off Lord Mening\u2019s son and heir with a penknife, which meant she\u2019d vacated the premises before she\u2019d been able to replace the cook.</p><p>\u201cBut where would we stay?\u201d Adelaide protested. \u201cSurely not here. Our trunks and our ladies\u2019 maids should arrive in an hour or two . . . are we to sleep on the grass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take rooms for all of you in the Horn &amp; Stag in Tonbridge,\u201d Dautry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a decent place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSplendid,\u201d India said.</p><p>Adelaide sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my goddaughter is used to getting her way,\u201d she told Dautry.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Rose and her nursemaid could stay at the Horn &amp; Stag during the house party?\u201d India asked, still grappling with the issue of Thorn\u2019s ward.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cI want her close to me at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there any outbuildings on the estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dower house and a gatehouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could renovate the dower house as well,\u201d India said. \u201cShe would be very close to you; you could visit her daily. But she would be out of Lady Rainsford\u2019s sight, at least until her ladyship had agreed to your betrothal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever planning to marry?\u201d Mr. Dautry asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d India said, nonplussed.</p><p>\u201cOf course she will marry,\u201d Adelaide exclaimed, sounding scandalized. \u201cIndia has more suitors than she knows what to do with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncredible,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMiracles never cease. I am always surprised by what my sex will tolerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d India said sweetly. \u201cI myself am never surprised by men. Absurdity is so common that it seems characteristic of your sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dears, you are squabbling like the children I am happy never to have had,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cIndia, I suggest that we retire to the inn and discuss your suitability to take on such a large project.\u201d</p><p>India should have followed Adelaide out the door, but she didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou will have to be kinder once you marry Laetitia,\u201d she said to Dautry. Something in his eyes told her that he wasn\u2019t thinking about his fianc\u00e9e at the moment. \u201cShe will wither if you speak to her like that. She\u2019s too amiable to stand up to your sarcasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s precisely why I\u2019ve chosen her,\u201d Dautry said, prowling toward her. \u201cNot because of some absurd wish to enter the peerage. If I wanted to marry a woman merely for her title, I wouldn\u2019t have chosen Laetitia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be lucky if she accepts your offer,\u201d India said. \u201cEven she deserves\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven she? Are you implying something about my future bride\u2019s virtue?\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cOf course not! Your mind is in the gutter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. So what did you mean?\u201d</p><p>India hesitated. She was shocked to see that he was grinning again, his eyes locked on hers.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re about to inform me that Laetitia is a noodle, I know it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d India said carefully.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rainsford has a smile so charming that she\u2019s sweeter than honey. She is lovely and, like any red-blooded man, I am, shall we say, enthusiastic to bed her. She will never attempt to change me. She\u2019ll greet me every morning with a smile, offer me whatever I desire, and she\u2019ll do it cheerfully, because that\u2019s her nature.\u201d</p><p>India was struck by an emotion she had never dreamed she would experience: jealousy of Laetitia Rainsford. No man would ever describe India as sweeter than honey.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I give a damn about the fact that she doesn\u2019t know Greek?\u201d Dautry continued. \u201cOr how to multiply sums? I can do that myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India pulled herself back together. \u201cI\u2019ve been in many households in the last decade. I\u2019ve seen plenty of husbands who consider their wives to be ninnies. Over time, in their arrogance, they leach away the sweetness they once loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are fools,\u201d Dautry said flatly. \u201cA wife is an investment, like any other, and I take care of my possessions. I will coddle Laetitia, and frankly, I would never speak to her the way I have to you, because I\u2019ve spoken to you the way I speak to a man.\u201d</p><p>Outrage surged through India\u2019s body. \u201cLaetitia will not be your possession,\u201d she said between clenched teeth. \u201cShe will be your wife. Your partner in life. And for your information, I am not a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed? I think you may be a general disguised in women\u2019s clothing.\u201d</p> <p>That did it. Lala was sweet as honey, and she was a general. The words that went through India\u2019s mind weren\u2019t polite ones. \u201cI shall send a note around to your London residence with names of some tradespeople and artisans who should be able to help you,\u201d she said tightly.</p><p>Dautry shook his head. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot have me. Now, if you\u2019ll please move out of the way, I shall join my godmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised to make this house habitable so that Laetitia and her family can be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have everything you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid,\u201d he said, taunting.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing for me to fear.\u201d She placed a hand on his chest and pushed. \u201cI would like you to step away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid of failure? You can\u2019t tolerate being my temporary wife for three weeks?\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t like the way his gray eyes had turned smoky, like the sky at twilight.</p><p>He repeated, \u201cAre you afraid that you\u2019ll fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not. Move back, or I will shout for help. My coachman is very large.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you did that, we would be compromised,\u201d he said, his voice dropping. \u201cLady Adelaide seems to have forgotten that she left us unchaperoned. Can you imagine the two of us permanently shackled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I cannot,\u201d India stated. \u201cNow, for the last time, will you please allow me to leave the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be afraid of the work, but you\u2019re afraid of something,\u201d he said, not moving an inch. Instead he braced himself against the wall with a hand by her left ear, which brought his face even closer to hers.</p><p>India could smell him, a wild, woodsy smell, like soap and wind.</p><p>\u201cThus, I deduce that you\u2019re afraid of me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d India said, keeping her voice even. \u201cBut I believe that Laetitia could do much better than marry a man who considers her a noodle and wants to treat her well merely because he paid for her!\u201d</p><p>At that, he threw back his head and roared with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re a romantic! Under all that brass and bluster, you\u2019re a romantic!\u201d</p><p>India balled up her fist and struck him on the shoulder as hard as she could. He did not flinch at the blow, but he fell backward a step, still laughing. She turned to go, muttering under her breath.</p> <p>He caught her arm. \u201cWhat did you say, India?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and glared at him. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you tell me what you said.\u201d That dimple again.</p><p>\u201cI said that you are a bastard,\u201d she told him, straight out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re correct.\u201d The man was damnably attractive when he laughed. His gray eyes turned warm. And warm was dangerous because it made India feel warm too.</p><p>She wrenched her wrist from his grip.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t renovate Starberry Court,\u201d he called when she was halfway to the door, \u201cI\u2019ll inform Eleanor that you called me a bastard and used my birth as the reason you fled.\u201d</p><p>India froze, then turned around slowly. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I meant, and you know it!\u201d The Duke of Villiers and his wife were fiercely protective of his illegitimate children. Eleanor might forgive her; Villiers would not. And she liked them. She liked both of them.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s what you said. I have you in a corner, India. If you\u2019re thinking that my father wouldn\u2019t like it . . . you\u2019re right. Not only would he not like it; he would destroy your reputation without a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would. I want Laetitia as my wife. I don\u2019t want to waste time looking for another woman. Her mother is apparently hell-bent on her daughter being kitted out with a country estate, thus I must invite her here before the news about Rose leaks, as you informed me outside. And you have made it more than clear that I need your taste\u2014did you say that it was impeccable? Not just any tradesman can do the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are blackmailing me. You are a corrupt\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you\u2019ll have to renovate the dower house as well. That wasn\u2019t a bad idea on your part. Rose can stay in the dower house during the party so that the Rainsfords don\u2019t jump to the same conclusion you did about her parentage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t like it whenever they meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe I\u2019ll take up your idea about a special license. They can meet Rose once I\u2019m their son-in-law.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said, giving in. She would hate it if Eleanor thought she was so insufferable that she wouldn\u2019t associate with Thorn due to his birth. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay for the party as well,\u201d he said, his voice deep and smooth now he\u2019d got everything he wanted. \u201cI\u2019ve invited a friend of mine who will likely fall madly in love with you. You need a husband, and he\u2019s available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no need for your help finding a husband!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would only be fair,\u201d he said, his voice pious and his eyes dancing.</p><p>India curled her nails so tightly into her palms that they dented her skin. \u201cI want an unlimited budget. I\u2019ll have to hire half of London to get this done quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. We rich bastards come in three sorts: rich, very rich, and even richer. I\u2019m the last sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you any specific requests as regards decoration of the house?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI like every color other than red. My father appreciates luxury, and one guest room should look like a king\u2019s palace, if possible. Get rid of those naked statues, unless you want to keep the satyr for yourself. It\u2019s sad to think of you having grown this old without ever glimpsing a man\u2019s arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever say anything like that to me again, I will walk out that door and never return,\u201d India stated.</p><p>There was a moment of silence, and then he smiled again. It was galling to recognize a drop of admiration in his eyes. \u201cBalls,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a general!\u201d she said, and then kept going, made reckless by fury. \u201cHow do you know I haven\u2019t seen a man\u2019s arse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have, you have untold depths, Lady Xenobia,\u201d he said, his amusement clear.</p><p>\u201cLady Adelaide and I will welcome you back in precisely a week,\u201d she said, ignoring his provocation. \u201cBy then, I will know the full extent of what needs to be done.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight. One more thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want a bed in Laetitia\u2019s room; she\u2019ll sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bed?\u201d India said, incredulous. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll put a bed in your wife\u2019s chamber. What if she doesn\u2019t wish to sleep with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sleep together.\u201d He folded his arms again.</p><p>\u201cYour wife\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. She deserves much better than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d India snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018I\u2019 is ungrammatical; it should be, \u2018She deserves much better than me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He burst out laughing, so India talked over him. \u201cPrivacy is a lady\u2019s prerogative, no matter whether her husband considers her\u2014and treats her like\u2014a possession.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou seem to think that Laetitia won\u2019t want to sleep with me,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cDear me, India. You take such a dismal view of marriage; you must at least feign optimism once you accept a man\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel and stamped out of the room, followed by a deep masculine chuckle. \u201cI saw your lips moving,\u201d he called. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell Lady Adelaide that you never curse? Or were you talking about her butler?\u201d</p><p>Choice words rocketed through India\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThree weeks with Lady Xenobia as my wife,\u201d Dautry said, still laughing as he caught up with her. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better prologue to a life with Laetitia.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>June 20, 1799</p> <p>The Horn &amp; Stage Inn</p><p>Just after sunrise the next morning, India rousted Adelaide from her bed and dragged her back to Starberry Court.</p><p>\u201cWhy must we be here early?\u201d Adelaide asked, her sentence cut off by a yawn. \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to see Jupp\u2019s statuary again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so much to do; I can\u2019t waste time.\u201d India crossed the entry hall, feeling a rising sense of excitement.</p><p>Adelaide trailed after her. \u201cThe statues look absolutely revolting in the morning light, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>A bird\u2014or a flock of them\u2014had plainly roosted on the marbles\u2019 heads and other bits of their anatomy; all the sculptures were lavishly streaked with white. India didn\u2019t care. Her first order of business was to inventory the rooms. After that she would tackle cleaning, with the help of every chambermaid she could find in the village and vicinity.</p><p>Adelaide drifted through the entry, morosely holding her skirts above the dust. She loved to accompany India from house to house, primarily because it gave her an opportunity for a long visit with acquaintances. India loved the challenge, but Adelaide loved the company.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no danger of finding myself compromised here,\u201d India said. \u201cBy noon today, I\u2019ll be surrounded by laborers, from gardeners to maids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true enough,\u201d Adelaide said, poking at one of the statues with a gloved finger. \u201cI think this one is a copy. It\u2019s plaster, not marble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not return to the inn? You could send my lady\u2019s maid back in the carriage and spend the day relaxing in that lovely parlor, reading a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie would be here in no time, Adelaide. And since Dautry rented the entire inn, your presence will give the innkeeper and his wife something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist,\u201d India said firmly, taking Adelaide straight back out the door and leading her to the carriage. \u201cI\u2019ll see you for dinner tonight, dearest. I\u2019d be most grateful if the innkeeper could send a light luncheon.\u201d</p><p>Once Adelaide was gone, India returned inside, enjoying the great echoing sense of the house. A surge of excitement bubbled inside her. Furnishing and staffing a great house from the ground up would be the perfect swan song to her career.</p><p>She would give Starberry Court a sense of dignity and tradition, with a balance of beauty and comfort. Interestingly, the furnishings that were left in the house did not live up to Jupp\u2019s lurid reputation. There was some unfortunate damask wallpaper in one bedchamber, but that was a question of taste rather than depravity. And if Jupp had hung his bedstead in garish red velvet, the cloth had long since been stolen.</p><p>She pulled out a piece of foolscap. One sheet would account for every object in the house, and another would list ideas for walls and furnishings. In the next hour, she opened every drawer in the kitchens, wrinkled her nose at the privies, and investigated the butler\u2019s pantry, only to find empty shelves lined with felt where silver should have been.</p><p>When three women arrived from the village, she promised to pay them half again as much as their regular wage. Her maid, Marie, appeared and professed herself happy to help as well. They all began dragging furniture downstairs, and even throwing some out the windows with the help of Adelaide\u2019s grooms.</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I am attaching a list of all the usable furniture discovered in the house. Most important is an extraordinarily beautiful cabinet with pearl-inlaid swans on panels of exotic wood. It bears the mark of the artist Jean-Henri Reisener, who is one of the most notable French cabinetmakers.</p><p>As you\u2019ll see, the list is short, as unfortunately most furnishings have been damaged or stolen. I will be buying a great many items in the next week and shall have the invoices sent directly to you. I will also be contracting for wall painting and coverings.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>Dear Lady Xenobia,</p><p>It\u2019s nice to know that you haven\u2019t crashed through an unstable floorboard and broken your neck. Swans and more swans . . . what have you done with Leda? I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m very fond of swans. Did you know that the males bite hard enough to snap a child\u2019s arm bone?</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I am sending this note back by the groom who delivered yours. In a piece of luck, we discovered that the cellars are intact. You have a quite fine collection of wine, which includes port laid down twenty years ago. When we find a butler, he will have to fill in gaps in the collection, but of course the sediment in any new bottles would not have settled by the time of your house party.</p><p>You will also be glad to know that there are no swans in the river that borders your gardens. I put Leda in the attics; a bosom that size might terrify an unwary chambermaid.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>Dear Lady Xenobia,</p><p>I speak for all the males in the house when I say that Leda\u2019s bosom was the best thing about her.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>\u201cThere is no response,\u201d India told the groom who had spent the day riding back and forth to London. By all rights, she should throw such a disgraceful missive in the fire.</p><p>Instead she folded it and slipped it in her pocket.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>June 22, 1799</p><p>76 Portman Square, London</p><p>Home of Lord and Lady Rainsford</p><p>and their daughter Laetitia</p><p>Miss Laetitia Rainsford, known to her family and friends as Lala, was in the grip of a wave of pure, unadulterated panic. Mr. Dautry would soon arrive for tea. Her mother had already succumbed to three spasms that morning, and Lala felt as if she was on the verge of her very first.</p><p>He was coming. Mr. Dautry. The son of the Duke of Villiers. Her suitor. He had made his intentions very clear, although this was the first time he had paid them a call. She had met him a month ago in Kensington Gardens, at which time Dautry had told her plainly that he meant to court her, following that up with an appointment with her father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She truly appreciated his clarity and decisiveness, because she always found herself confused when people engaged in clever conversation. Society conversation.</p><p>She hated society.</p><p>\u201cLala!\u201d She turned to find her mother standing in the drawing room doorway, clutching a handkerchief, looking the very personification of self-sacrifice. \u201cIs that what you mean to wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am wearing this gown,\u201d Lala replied, clasping her hands behind her back tightly so that her mother couldn\u2019t see that they were shaking. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t time to change it now, Mama. Mr. Dautry will be here any moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose that is the best you can do,\u201d Lady Rainsford said, eyeing Lala\u2019s hips. \u201cHe must not mind overly about your shape, as he has accepted our invitation to tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am of the impression that he does not dislike my form,\u201d Lala said, finding her voice. Her aunt had told her that she had been dubbed the most beautiful debutante of the season, but her mother never said a word about that; she was obsessed with the overly generous shape of Lala\u2019s hips. \u201cMy figure is not terrible, Mama.\u201d Where did that come from? She never stood up to her mother.</p><p>Surprisingly, Lady Rainsford didn\u2019t burst into an angry retort. Instead, she strolled into the room, sat down, and said, \u201cThe man\u2019s a bastard. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d</p><p>Lala swallowed and said, \u201cMama, Mr. Dautry is no beggar; he is extremely wealthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaughter! A lady never speaks of money in such a direct and vulgar manner.\u201d Her mother raised a melodramatic hand to her brow, like a bad actor in a penny drama.</p> <p>As Lala saw it, given that ladies such as her mother took great pleasure in spending money, the subject could not be outlawed. \u201cJulia heard from a friend that he recently bought a country estate because he is planning to marry.\u201d</p><p>Her mother straightened. \u201cWhich estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarberry Court.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rainsford sank back onto the sofa again, brow creased in a way that would give her palpitations if she caught sight of it in the mirror. \u201cThat\u2019s the Earl of Jupp\u2019s estate\u2014before the line died out, of course. Dautry probably bought it for a song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty thousand pounds,\u201d Lala said, telling the first huge lie of her life. She had made up the biggest sum she could imagine.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suppose his money balances his blood,\u201d her mother said, showing no reaction to the sum, though Lala knew she had to be impressed. \u201cSit down, if you please. You drive me to distraction the way you\u2019re looming about. You must remember, dear, that your bottom is better hidden than revealed in the open air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand you dislike talk of money, Mama, but I also know that Father is feeling very strained by lack of funds and would prefer not to pay for another season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, your father,\u201d Lady Rainsford said, allowing her head to droop like an unwatered tulip. \u201cWhen has the man not fussed about this or that? My ill health is due to his constant laments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry won\u2019t care that I have no dowry,\u201d Lala said bluntly. \u201cAnd he\u2019s likely to give Father a very large settlement if we marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Lord Rainsford could talk the hind leg off a donkey on that subject,\u201d her mother cried. \u201cNeither of you seems to understand what a disgrace it would be to marry my daughter to a by-blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter married to Mr. Dautry than never married at all.\u201d Lala had been beset by suitors all season, but her father had rejected every one. She knew why: he had decided that her beauty was worth a huge settlement. In short, no one had bid high enough to pay off his debts.</p><p>\u201cIf only you\u2019d eat less, your season might have had an entirely different outcome!\u201d her mother said, her voice becoming a little shrill. \u201cWhy, you were seated beside Lord Brody, the Duke of Pindar\u2019s heir, throughout six courses. You could be a duchess!\u201d</p><p>To Lala\u2019s mind, her failure with Lord Brody had nothing to do with her figure. It was because she was stupid. She couldn\u2019t follow conversations that pinged like tennis balls, clever expressions flying back and forth. His Grace had looked bored by the end of the first course.</p><p>\u201cFather cannot afford another season,\u201d she said, going back to the only point that might influence her mother. \u201cThus, if I don\u2019t marry Mr. Dautry, I might never marry at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to play the martyr,\u201d her mother said, clutching her handkerchief in a manner that threatened to shred it. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you actually want me to have another nervous spasm. I\u2019m sure we all wish you would marry, even if it is to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The butler opened the door and announced, \u201cMr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>Lala knew perfectly well that her mother\u2019s voice was audible in the entry, even through the door. Whenever she heard that strident tone in the drawing room, she tiptoed up the stairs.</p><p>But Mr. Dautry strolled into the room as casually as a lion into its den, Lala thought, with a sudden\u2014and uncharacteristic\u2014turn to metaphor. Except that lions\u2019 eyes were tawny and hungry, and Mr. Dautry\u2019s eyes were the color of the sky on a windy, rainy day: cold, without an ounce of sentiment. His rumpled black hair was a bit longer than the fashion, but then, as far as she knew, he had nothing to do with the ton, so why should he follow fashion? And yet she noted with relief that his coat and breeches had been crafted by a master. Her mother would never forgive a second-rate tailor.</p><p>\u201cIt is such a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Dautry,\u201d Lala said, risking the revelation of her bottom by rising from her chair. \u201cMother, may I present Mr. Dautry to you?\u201d</p><p>As Dautry bowed, Lala realized that her mother was responding to the masculinity that clung to him like a second skin. Her handkerchief was no longer clenched, but began gently waving about, conveying a sense of fragility.</p><p>Mr. Dautry wasn\u2019t the man Lala would have chosen for a husband; he was altogether too rough and masculine, with his hard eyes and the way the air seemed to vibrate slightly around him. But that was irrelevant.</p><p>As her mother had said, beggars can\u2019t be choosers.</p><p>Throughout the fuss over the tea tray, Lala told herself that she was not going to sit like a stone, without opening her mouth. She was going to be witty. She had rehearsed some clever things to say, and she had asked her maid to read aloud the Morning Post. If the conversation lagged, she planned to say\u2014brightly\u2014\u201cIsn\u2019t it marvelous that those terrible mutinies in the Royal Navy were put down quickly?\u201d</p><p>Mercifully, she didn\u2019t have to blurt it out immediately, because her mother was inquiring about the \u201cdear duchess,\u201d Dautry\u2019s stepmother, even though Lala knew perfectly well that her mother had, at best, a nodding acquaintance with the Duchess of Villiers.</p><p>Dautry was obviously aware that her mother did not move in such exalted circles. At the same time, he didn\u2019t seem to care that she was claiming acquaintanceship. Despite Lala\u2019s nerves, a smile turned up the corners of her mouth. And Dautry smiled back at her\u2014with his eyes only, but she saw it.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess is great friends with Mrs. Worsley, is she not?\u201d her mother was saying. \u201cMrs. Worsley is so lively at the dinner table. She always leads the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Dautry did not reply, and neither did Lala. She had learned long ago that replies were not obligatory when conversing with her mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how to speak as she does, going on and on about affairs of state and matters of high culture. There\u2019s something unrefined about it, don\u2019t you agree, Mr. Dautry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find Mrs. Worsley an interesting conversationalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen do, do they not?\u201d Lady Rainsford exclaimed. \u201cThat is, she has the trick of talking to every man as if she adored him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd every woman as if she loathed her,\u201d Mr. Dautry said. \u201cI suppose that I fall on the lucky side of that divide. But I come with an ulterior purpose, Lady Rainsford. Your daughter has told me of your exquisite taste.\u201d</p> <p>Lala had never said anything like that, but she recognized the work of a master and smiled as if she had, indeed, said as much.</p><p>\u201cI have recently acquired a country estate, Starberry Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we have heard,\u201d Lala\u2019s mother said, adding, with inexcusable vulgarity, \u201cfor some twenty thousand pounds.\u201d That was typical of her mother: she chastised Lala for mentioning money, but considered her own social position so secure that she could say whatever she wished.</p><p>Mr. Dautry clearly did not like to discuss his finances. But when Lala looked at him with a plea in her eyes, he did not utter the rebuke her mother deserved. Instead, he said, \u201cThat rumor was inaccurate. The sum was close to double that; the lands are quite extensive.\u201d</p><p>His expression apparently reminded Lady Rainsford just how presumptuous she had been; the handkerchief began fluttering about her face as she peeped over it.</p> <p>\u201cAt any rate,\u201d Mr. Dautry continued, \u201cI should be very grateful to have your advice on restorations you might suggest for the estate, Lady Rainsford. I am thinking of assembling a small house party for just that purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are frightfully idle in this family,\u201d Lala\u2019s mother replied, still playing peekaboo with her handkerchief. \u201cEven so, our social engagements keep us running hither and thither all the time. When will you hold your party, Mr. Dautry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn three weeks, if that will suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall look at my engagement calendar.\u201d She looked as if she were bestowing a shilling on a vagabond.</p><p>Lala could read his eyes without difficulty. He thought her mother horrible. She rose, guessing that her suitor had endured all the intimate time with Lady Rainsford that he could tolerate. \u201cMr. Dautry, it has been such a pleasure to see you.\u201d</p><p>Dautry sprang to his feet with the speed of a racehorse.</p> <p>\u201cYou must forgive me for not rising,\u201d Lala\u2019s mother told him. \u201cMy health is a constant concern to those who love me, and I do my best to conserve my energy in order to cause them less worry.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until after Dautry had departed that Lala realized she hadn\u2019t uttered a word the entire time, other than \u201chello\u201d and \u201cgoodbye.\u201d Her heart sank. So much for being clever and funny.</p><p>She\u2019d done it again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pea-goose,\u201d her mother said, confirming the thought. \u201cHow can a man be expected to spend a lifetime with a woman who doesn\u2019t make an effort to entertain him? That\u2019s the least a wife can do, you know. They feed us, clothe us, take care of us, and in return, we entertain them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama,\u201d Lala said.</p><p>\u201cWe charm them with our beauty and our conversation, soothing away the cares of the day.\u201d</p><p>Lala wished her father were there to hear this lecture. It might be the first thing he\u2019d laughed at in weeks.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I have bought silk for the drawing room walls. The cost is approximately \u00a3300, but they will send the invoice to you directly.</p><p>Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>Dear Lady Xenobia,</p><p>The invoice for silk arrived, asking for \u00a3350. I also received an invoice from an Italian painter by the name of Marconi, who is charging \u00a3150 for painting swallows. Where are these swallows? They must be formed from liquid gold, so I want to make sure I notice them.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>The swallows will be on the dining room walls. As you seem to be worried about costs, I had your statues assessed. You will be happy to know that the bronze was indeed sculpted by Benvenuto Cellini, and may be worth a great deal of money. I can arrange to sell the piece, if you wish.</p><p>Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>Dear Lady Xenobia,</p><p>Offer it to the vicar. If for some strange reason he doesn\u2019t want it, I might give it to you as a wedding present.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>The vicar would be gravely offended, and I shall not do such a thing. Nor do I desire a wedding present of that nature.</p><p>Lady Xenobia</p><p>Dear Lady Xenobia,</p><p>I think I\u2019ll call you Lady X. It has such an exotic sound to it; I feel as if I am writing to the madam of a prosperous brothel. (I\u2019ve never done that before, in case you\u2019re wondering.)</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I am named after a queen who conquered all of Egypt, not after a brothel owner. Had you paid attention to your history lessons, you would presumably know that.</p><p>Lady Xenobia</p><p>Dear Lady X,</p><p>Please do remember that you are my temporary wife, in other words, at my beck and call for the next three weeks. I begin to see a spiritual purpose in all the money I\u2019m spending to tame the Queen of Egypt. My first command is that you address me as Thorn.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>We all know you were born on the wrong side of the blanket, but you needn\u2019t have called yourself after a bush. It seems unreasonably humble.</p><p>Lady Xenobia</p><p>Dear Lady X,</p><p>You will have to imagine my response. I cannot put it in writing.</p><p>My given name is Tobias, a self-effacing name that doesn\u2019t suit. I was informed of it when I was twelve, at which point it was already inappropriate.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I like Tobias. It has an intellectual ring. A man with that name should be able to recite ancient Greek poetry.</p><p>Lady Xenobia</p><p>I rest my case.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>June 27, 1799</p><p>Evening</p><p>Starberry Court</p><p>India had never been so tired in her life. The house had been gutted and scoured, and the interior walls replastered, the hardest physical labor completed in record time by crews paid treble their usual wages.</p><p>What was left now was the more nuanced work of making Starberry Court into a luxurious residence, with a patina of refinement and respectability. That would start tomorrow, when tradesmen would begin arriving with furnishings. But at the moment she could only think about a bath and her bed at the Horn &amp; Stag.</p><p>She was heading outside to summon her coachman when the sound of a carriage made her look up. Perhaps one of the tradesmen had decided to beat the crowd.</p><p>But then she recognized Dautry\u2019s glossy black coach and vaguely remembered that he had mentioned an inspection visit. Watching as he leapt from the carriage, she decided that he looked remarkably like the statue of the satyr. Maybe it was exhaustion making her hazy, but his shoulders seemed just as wide.</p><p>The satyr\u2019s hair was curlier; Dautry\u2019s tumbled around his ears. Presumably, he didn\u2019t have cloven feet, but one never knew. He might. There was something about his eyes that was just as naughty. Devilish, really.</p><p>She corrected herself: Adelaide had explained that the satyr was not a devil, never mind the hooves and tail. In the back of her mind, she was aware that she wasn\u2019t making sense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, you look awful,\u201d Dautry said, by way of greeting.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cWhy, thank you. How very kind of you to point it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me around the place and then we\u2019ll go to the inn for supper, because you are about to fall over. Did you sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said, trying to remember whether she had. She\u2019d been making yet more lists and had been surprised by the dawn. The day had been frantic as the last of the walls was replastered, the kitchen\u2019s new slate floor was laid, the privies cleaned . . . All of that had to be completed before the new furniture could be brought in.</p> <p>Dautry walked through the rooms so quickly that India had difficulty keeping up. \u201cLooks good,\u201d he announced when he had seen all the plastering and the new floor in the kitchen. \u201cWe need some chairs and tables.\u201d</p><p>India explained about the tradesmen who would be arriving on the morrow with carts of furniture, rugs, and smaller objects. \u201cI hope to be able to furnish the servants\u2019 quarters and the bedrooms from what they bring.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSupper,\u201d he said, taking her arm.</p><p>She was tall for a woman, but he was taller. And very solid.</p><p>\u201cI really must go to bed,\u201d she said, feeling instinctively that the less time she spent with her employer, the better.</p> <p>There was something disturbing about him, and the feeling was all the more intense after their exchange of letters. A taut awareness between them made her skin prickle.</p><p>\u201cSupper, followed by bed,\u201d he stated.</p><p>They left the house, but she came to an abrupt halt next to his carriage. \u201cI can\u2019t leave; my coachman won\u2019t know where I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the stables, of course.\u201d</p><p>Dautry jerked his head at his groom, who trotted away. \u201cYou\u2019re in this house alone? Where\u2019s your maid? And your coachman is in the stables?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t make people work all night long,\u201d she said indignantly. Then she remembered the first night and added, \u201cAt least not without paying them a great deal of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should not be in the house alone,\u201d Dautry said. Without warning he slid his arm behind her knees and lifted her.</p><p>India started to protest, but in one clean motion he tossed her onto the carriage seat. He jumped in, swung the door shut, and thumped the ceiling.</p><p>Their eyes kept tangling in an embarrassing way, so India tried looking out the window. The cows looked as sleepy as she did.</p><p>\u201cYou ought to have footmen guarding you at all times,\u201d Dautry said. \u201cI\u2019ll send a couple of mine out from London tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d she said, feeling dizzy. \u201cMy maid is with me all day, and once the servants\u2019 quarters are furnished, I shall be able to hire proper staff. The registry service is sending candidates tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they reached the inn, she could go to bed. Meanwhile, she kept her backbone straight with pure force of will.</p><p>In a smooth blur of movement, Dautry moved to sit beside her. He propped himself in the corner, yanked her against his chest, and ordered, \u201cSleep.\u201d</p> <p>She immediately tried to sit up again. \u201cThis is quite improper! And besides, I don\u2019t nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff propriety,\u201d he said, sounding impatient. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry you, Lady X, and you don\u2019t want to marry me, so who the hell will ever know\u2014or care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never nap,\u201d India repeated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t nap, in that case.\u201d But he didn\u2019t loosen the arm holding her against him.</p><p>It would be undignified to continue to struggle. And every bone and muscle in her body was grateful to not be sitting upright.</p><p>Dautry didn\u2019t seem uncomfortable. \u201cSince I saw you last, Rose and I have been getting to know each other. She has added the study of French verbs in the imperfect tense to her Greek. Last night she walked round and round my library, reciting them in that odd voice of hers: \u2018Nous venions, vous veniez.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>India could hear his heart beating quite slowly, like a melody played on a piano far away, in another part of the house. The carriage rocked gently beneath them. \u201cI have no idea what that means,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cNo Frenchman would understand her either. She has an appalling accent; she sounds like an old dowager butchering the language. I\u2019ve promised her a tutor, but I can already tell it won\u2019t make any difference. I haven\u2019t been able to find a governess I like yet, and she\u2019s peeved at me.\u201d</p><p>India was thinking about that as she drifted off to sleep.</p><p>When she woke, she was still lying down, no longer in the carriage but in a room with windows open to an evening breeze. The far-off rhythm of Dautry\u2019s heartbeat was still there, under her ear. And there was a light pressure on her back from his warm hand simply resting there.</p><p>Her heart pulsed momentarily with loneliness, because she couldn\u2019t remember anyone ever before putting a hand on her while she slept.</p><p>She sat up, peered at him, and said, \u201cHello.\u201d They seemed to be in a room at the Horn &amp; Stag, and something had happened to her hair; it was tumbling past her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI like your hair,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my mother\u2019s,\u201d India said, in a voice husky with sleep. \u201cThere\u2019s too much of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could stuff a pillow with it someday.\u201d</p><p>She chose not to respond to that absurdity. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA book about Leonardo\u2019s inventions.\u201d</p><p>India had no idea who Leonardo was, but she didn\u2019t feel up to asking. The expression in Dautry\u2019s eyes as he watched her rearrange her hair made her want to ask him what he was thinking\u2014and run away to her room, both at the same time. Absurd.</p><p>She took a deep breath and twisted all her hair around itself. Most of her hairpins seemed to be mysteriously missing.</p><p>\u201cI pulled them out in the carriage,\u201d Dautry said, watching her fruitlessly pat her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was bored.\u201d He took a pin from his waistcoat pocket and gave it to her. \u201cDo you know, I think I could make a better hairpin, one that bent in the middle.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t see how that would improve the design, but it seemed impolite to say so, especially after he\u2019d presumably carried her inside. \u201cI must apologize, Mr. Dautry, for falling asleep in such an unladylike manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to address me as Thorn, remember? I already issued a command to that effect. I\u2019m tired of \u2018Lady X.\u2019 I shall call you India, as your godmother does. \u2018Lady X\u2019 sounds like a woman with a repertoire of exotic sexual services to offer. You haven\u2019t, have you?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I will retire to my chamber. I will, of course, continue to inform you of my progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said much about progress,\u201d he observed. \u201cInstead, you\u2019ve sent me bills so large that I could have wallpapered half the East End.\u201d He reached over and tugged on the bell.</p><p>The innkeeper immediately opened the door. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for supper,\u201d Thorn told him. The man bowed and withdrew again.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d India said, just as her hair uncurled and fell down her back again. Though it was true that her stomach felt as if it were pressing against her backbone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say some idiotic thing about how you can\u2019t eat dinner because a lady shouldn\u2019t eat with a man, or some damned thing along those lines, just don\u2019t. I\u2019m starving. You\u2019re hungry and tired. Furthermore, you\u2019re not a lady right now, but in my employ, and I could eat with my butler if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Before she decided whether she was more hungry than tired, or more tired than hungry, the innkeeper bustled in with a large covered salver, followed by two maids with china and cutlery.</p><p>After they laid the table, India didn\u2019t think about it any longer. She and Thorn sat at the table and ate oyster stew, followed by roast beef, French beans, peas, and a very good cheese pie. She ate more than she\u2019d eaten in days. She drank two glasses of wine, then sipped a third glass more slowly, as she watched Thorn eat more of everything.</p><p>\u201cYou have an impressive appetite,\u201d she said, somewhat awed.</p> <p>\u201cAs have you,\u201d he said, working on another helping of peas. \u201cI like a woman who doesn\u2019t nibble like a goat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLala has a very charming figure,\u201d she offered.</p><p>He looked up and grinned. He had lovely white teeth. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She was beginning to feel owlish and drowsily content, so she put her elbows on the table. Even not having had a governess, she knew it was deeply improper. Actually, worse than that: maybe it was criminal.</p><p>Thorn wouldn\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be quite happy together.\u201d She poured more wine for him, thought about it, and poured more for herself as well. \u201cWill you tell me about growing up in East London?\u201d she asked, propping up her head with one hand.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t fun,\u201d he said. His voice dropped in register.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t suppose it was fun. I imagined it was terrible. But I don\u2019t know, which is why I asked.\u201d</p><p>He had curious eyes, a gray that looked almost green in the lamplight. With a thick fringe of black lashes. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She took a sip of wine, feeling heat pool in her stomach. It was his fault for being so damned handsome. She pushed the thought away. \u201cI am curious about any number of things. Almost every moment, I realize something else I don\u2019t know. For example, I don\u2019t know who Leonardo was, any more than I understood Rose\u2019s French verbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo particular reason why you should know about Leonardo,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cHe was an artist, though I don\u2019t care about that. I\u2019m interested in his inventions.\u201d</p> <p>He was looking down at what remained of the cheese pie as if he were about to take another piece, even though he\u2019d already eaten three. India reached across and took it away. \u201cYou\u2019ve eaten enough. You will grow fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get fat.\u201d He growled it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve probably grown a paunch from all the food you\u2019ve just eaten,\u201d she said, enjoying herself.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he stood up wordlessly, pulled his shirt from his breeches, and bared his stomach.</p><p>India barely stopped her mouth from falling open. He looked like . . . like something. Like no man she\u2019d ever seen. Not that she\u2019d seen many men. But she knew they were soft around the middle, the same as she was. Thorn wasn\u2019t. His torso was rippled with muscle under taut skin. Rather than white, it was sun-browned, and a little line of hair led straight into his waistband.</p><p>\u201cI trust I have made my point,\u201d he said, sitting down again. \u201cNow I shall have a slice of strawberry tart with cream.\u201d He cut the tart and took half for himself. He cut another quarter and put it before her. And then he poured thick cream on top of both plates.</p><p>India never ate sweets because she figured that there was about the right amount of her. Besides, Adelaide was convinced that dessert went straight to one\u2019s breasts, and India was wary of becoming more bosomy than she already was. Speaking of which\u2014speaking of whom?\u2014her godmother must have gone to sleep wondering why she hadn\u2019t returned for supper.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he commanded.</p> <p>She ate. He poured more wine and she drank that too.</p><p>\u201cYou appeared astonished at the sight of my stomach,\u201d he remarked, glancing at her from under his eyelashes. There was something sinful in his voice that made her feel muddled.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at the satyr\u2019s waist from the side, very carefully, his torso is almost as rippled as yours,\u201d India said.</p><p>Thorn burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cMost gentlemen\u2019s stomachs are quite different. Lord Dibbleshire\u2019s, for example,\u201d she confided.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d He had finished his tart, but he leaned forward and stole a forkful from the plate, even though it was the public dish and his fork should never have touched it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the latest to ask me to marry him,\u201d India said, faintly surprised to hear that her words emerged a bit slurred. She pushed away her wineglass.</p><p>\u201cHow many proposals have you received?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen. Or perhaps only nine\u2014I think that Sir Henry Damper didn\u2019t actually mean to ask me to marry him. He meant something else, but Adelaide appeared and he had to change what he was saying very quickly.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cHow many have asked you for \u2018something else\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a few,\u201d India said. \u201cBut mostly they ask me for marriage because, you see, it would be much cheaper to marry me than to hire me. I\u2019m very expensive.\u201d As he\u2019d done it first, she decided to take a bite from the dish.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what it was like to live on the streets?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up on the streets,\u201d he said, beginning to peel an apple. \u201cI was cared for by a nice woman until I was around six years old, when my father\u2019s solicitor took me away and placed me in an apprenticeship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d India said, thinking this sounded a good deal better than it could have been. \u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d She pulled her wineglass back and took another sip.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a real apprenticeship. My master was an old bastard who had a group of boys and forced us to do whatever he wanted.\u201d</p><p>Her glass froze in the air.</p><p>\u201cNot that. We were mudlarks. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I told you, I hardly know anything.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re an odd duck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just an ignorant one.\u201d</p><p>Dautry leaned forward. \u201cWho gave me a primer on the differences between plaster, paint, and silk for walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose things are not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow to speak correctly. In French and Greek. Knowing who famous people are, like Leonardo.\u201d She said his name carefully. \u201cAnd Cellini. You say that with a chee sound in front, but you don\u2019t spell it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you wouldn\u2019t know, because mudlarks don\u2019t have tutors. Do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d He began to cut the apple into precise slices.</p><p>\u201cWhat does a mudlark do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScavenge things from the Thames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that you went swimming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. But mostly we waited for low tide and waded into the mud to pick up whatever we could. Sometimes we found silver spoons and coins. But most of the time it was teeth, scraps of iron, buttons. Even handkerchiefs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India stared at Thorn in horror. \u201cThat\u2019s awful! And it could have been dangerous. Were you in danger of drowning when the tide came in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroken glass was a bigger problem. It lurks in the mud, and if you\u2019re unlucky with your foot or your hand, it will slice you, as easily as I\u2019m slicing this apple.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Slice you\u2019?\u201d India whispered. \u201cSlice you?\u201d she said, louder, because she didn\u2019t believe in whispering, even when the word was frightening.</p><p>\u201cInfection took a lot of the boys.\u201d He was watching her over his glass. \u201cThere are corpses in the water, and if you went into the water with an open wound, you were likely to get infected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She shouted that. She didn\u2019t mean to; it just came out of her mouth. \u201cHe made you go in the river when there were dead people in there? Did you step on them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s despicable!\u201d she cried. \u201cDespicable! How did he force you to wade into the mud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a violent man,\u201d Thorn said, without a trace of emotion in his voice. \u201cThough he never hit me. I would have killed him, and he knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have, sooner or later. Just to make him stop shouting at us.\u201d The memories didn\u2019t appear to bother him much, but they had to, somewhere deep inside.</p><p>But the story explained for her why Thorn wanted to marry Lala, besides the obvious fact of her beauty. She was such a sweet girl: she would make him feel better. She would smooth over all those bad memories.</p><p>India told him that, leaning on her elbow again. \u201cLala is just right for you. She\u2019s like sugar icing. She\u2019ll make it all sweet again.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, a bit squinty-eyed. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Make what sweet again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife. She\u2019s the perfect antidote to such a terrible experience.\u201d But there was one more thing she wanted to know. \u201cDid he feed you enough?\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes was sardonic, as if she were an idiot. Which she was. Whom she was?</p> <p>\u201cI hate being hungry,\u201d she said. But really, there wasn\u2019t much to be said about it, and she knew it as well as anyone, so she stood up, just catching the edge of the table before she lost her balance.</p><p>\u201cAnd I never drink to excess,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more interesting when you do. What do you know about being hungry?\u201d</p><p>India ignored that. \u201cI must go to bed. The carts will begin arriving at six in the morning. I promised a twenty percent bonus for every piece I take.\u201d</p><p>He drained his glass. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to stand up as soon as I do,\u201d she said, letting go of the table and heading toward the door. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to learn, Dautry. Lala will expect you to stand in her presence.\u201d</p><p>Then she jumped, because somehow he had got himself to the door before her. \u201cI\u2019m not Dautry,\u201d he said, a big hand curling around her upper arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re a bastard,\u201d she said obligingly, and giggled. \u201cTo be honest, I never said that word aloud before I said it to you.\u201d</p> <p>He turned her around so they faced each other. Her hands naturally came up to rest on his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Thorn, not \u2018Mr. Dautry.\u2019 Can you remember that?\u201d He gave her a little shake, as if she were a poplar tree and the wind had swooped by.</p><p>\u201cSome married couples don\u2019t even address each other by their Christian names!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorn isn\u2019t my given name, remember? Tobias is.\u201d</p><p>He looked rough and dangerous, like a man who would threaten to kill an evil master and mean it. \u201cTobias is not the right name for you,\u201d she said, leaning in a little bit to make her point.</p><p>The corners of his mouth quirked up. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Tobias would drink hot cocoa for breakfast and go bald. And I think he would wear flannel drawers, which I find truly abhorrent. You don\u2019t wear flannel drawers, do you?\u201d</p><p>His body went still again. \u201cWhat do you know about men\u2019s drawers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d she said, stepping away from him because she was within a second of leaning forward and putting her cheek against his chest. \u201cI know precisely the amount of fabric required to make a pair of drawers. Unless the man has a large stomach, in which case, I don\u2019t know how much fabric is needed, and the tailor must measure. But I have to say that I don\u2019t like the idea of flannel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad to know that I don\u2019t wear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is irrelevant to me.\u201d She added, just to make the point, \u201cMr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine for another two weeks. I\u2019m Thorn at meals and in letters. Not in public.\u201d</p><p>They would likely never eat together again after Starberry Court was finished, since she scarcely knew Lala.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>His eyes caught hers.</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014Thorn,\u201d she said irritably. \u201cUsing nicknames makes me feel as if we\u2019re siblings. Next you\u2019ll expect a kiss goodnight.\u201d</p><p>Something changed in his eyes, and India suddenly felt a bit more sober.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d His hands slipped down her back.</p><p>\u201cAre you offering to make me your mistress?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a second, then said, \u201cNo. But I am wondering if you have ever been kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have!\u201d</p><p>He bent his head, and his lips touched hers.</p><p>India was curious, very curious, so she stood still as the kiss happened. Then it was over.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was nice,\u201d she said, feeling a little trickle of disappointment. What had she expected? Kisses were kisses and nothing more. Three men had kissed her. Four, including Dautry. None of the kisses had been terribly interesting.</p><p>He pulled her closer, which set off a feeling of alarm. \u201cI must go to my bedchamber now,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDid that kiss make you desire to marry me?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cNo. Though it was very nice, of course. I think Lala will be very happy with your kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married yet,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cNor betrothed, because I wouldn\u2019t be kissing you if I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said promptly, and forgot she was standing in the circle of his arms, his hands warm on her back. \u201cDo you know that I once saw Mr. Bridewell-Cooper kissing the vicar\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bold choice. My guess would be that the gentleman has kissed many women who aren\u2019t his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do the same?\u201d For some reason, the answer mattered. Probably because Lala was such a dear, and not all that bright. Other women had to look out for her.</p><p>His expression turned dark. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was just the right answer,\u201d she said, giving him a lavish smile, her best smile. She stood on her toes and brushed her mouth over his, just as he had. \u201cI quite like being friends with a man. It\u2019s very interesting.\u201d Then, because she felt tipsy and chatty, she added, \u201cAnd I am glad you kissed me. It was very nice of you.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, she\u2019d done something wrong, because he scowled and pulled her against him. \u201cIf I\u2019m your friend, India, I can\u2019t leave you thinking that was a kiss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>He bent his head.</p><p>This kiss was different. India felt as if she were in a dream, one in which Thorn\u2019s eyes closed, and she glimpsed his thick, black lashes. And then his tongue slid between her lips.</p><p>She\u2019d never dreamed that a kiss could be so intimate. His tongue was there, in her mouth, as if he were talking to her. As if they were talking to each other. Silently. It made her shiver, and he pulled her even tighter.</p> <p>India decided that she really liked kissing. It was fun, she thought dimly. Very . . . very . . . something.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he growled, pulling back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, giving him another big smile. \u201cI like this. It\u2019s quite nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Nice\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Her smile dimmed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndia.\u201d He stopped. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were on hers, and she actually caught the precise moment he decided to be honest. \u201cYou\u2019re not good at kissing, India. In fact, you\u2019re downright terrible.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped and her arms fell away from his neck. \u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019d have to remember not to kiss her future spouse until after he proposed.</p><p>\u201cIndia\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all she let him say. He was probably going to offer her lessons, or some other absurd thing that only a man would think up. She ducked around him to leave, before realizing that her inadequacies weren\u2019t his fault. She turned and said, \u201cThank you for telling me, Thorn. I\u2019m sorry about\u2014\u201d</p> <p>That was all she managed to say, because he reached out and pulled her toward him once again. A large hand clamped on her bottom\u2014where no man had ever touched her!\u2014and he growled in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m not done yet.\u201d</p><p>His tongue swept into her mouth. She could actually feel his hunger deep inside her body, making her skin tingle. The hand that wasn\u2019t holding her against him came up and gripped her hair in his fist, tugging her head back.</p><p>A little whimper broke in her throat, and without thinking she bent her head sideways and brought her own tongue out to taste him.</p><p>The moment she did that, he groaned and his arm tightened around her. That kiss . . .</p><p>That kiss did things. To her, to her body. He was surrounding her, all hardness to her softness. The feeling made her hot and restless, and she made that little sound in the back of her throat again and pressed closer to him. She didn\u2019t know why she hadn\u2019t liked kissing before. It was tremendously interesting. It was more than interesting. It was . . .</p><p>Thorn cursed and pulled away from her.</p><p>India stood there, feeling feverish. \u201cI must be very drunk,\u201d she said, pulling herself together.</p><p>He was staring at her, eyes gray-green and wild. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said, and added, \u201cthis did not happen, Mr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Mr. Dautry\u2019?\u201d He growled it.</p><p>India realized that her heart was beating fast and her knees felt weak. She cleared her throat. \u201cRight. Thorn. Not that this will happen again.\u201d She walked out the door with admirable steadiness and got herself upstairs and into her bed.</p><p>When she woke up in the morning, she lay for a while trying to decide whether she was still a bad kisser, or whether he\u2019d taught her something. But when she ventured down to breakfast and learned that Thorn had set off at the break of dawn without even leaving a letter, she concluded that that spoke for itself.</p><p>The truth stung. Perhaps even more sharply because she had no idea what she should have done differently. But over the years she\u2019d learned that not everyone could be good at everything. She finally decided to put the whole subject out of her mind, into the same box as her childhood\u2014things better left unexamined.</p><p>Just as she made that decision, Adelaide walked into the breakfast room.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you and Mr. Dautry supped together last night,\u201d she said, helping herself to a serving of coddled egg from the sideboard. \u201cI suppose I ought to have chaperoned you, but this wicked cold kept me in bed all day. And in truth I don\u2019t worry about him, since the dear man has such an infatuation with Lala. Do you know that he told me that Lala was his ideal woman, perfect for him? Lala? I am as generous as the next person . . .\u201d</p><p>In the back of India\u2019s mind, the sting got a little sharper. One had to suppose that Thorn had kissed Lala\u2014how else could he have deemed her perfect?</p><p>After a struggle, India managed to control a bitter pulse of jealousy by telling herself that jealousy was unbecoming. Unladylike.</p><p>She ignored the part of her that didn\u2019t give a damn about being a lady and just wanted Thorn to consider her kisses perfect.</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>Today I received an invoice for Aubusson carpets. Are you nailing them to the roof in lieu of slate? There isn\u2019t enough floor space in the entire house for this number of rugs.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>P.S. I am sending this letter by one of my footmen, Fred. He\u2019s a country boy. I told him that you are not to be alone in that house at any time. The groom will return with your reply.</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>The carpets are an investment for future generations. Lala\u2019s mother will appreciate the furnishings, even if you don\u2019t.</p><p>India</p><p>P.S. Fred is a lovely fellow.</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>You do realize that I won\u2019t be marrying Laetitia\u2019s mother, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>Count your blessings.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>I received another collection of invoices, and now I am rethinking marriage altogether. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it. Did we really need that much champagne? Not to mention the barrel of Colchester oysters, the knitted stockings, and the pound of Fry\u2019s drinking chocolate?</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>Of course you must marry. Many men your age have already been inconsolable widowers, wooed, and won their second wives. You are a laggard in that respect.</p><p>India</p><p>P.S. The stockings are for your footmen (three begin next week), the oysters for Lady Rainsford (who adores oyster soup, according to Adelaide), and the chocolate for me.</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>You must be living for pleasure, considering that pound of chocolate. I think I\u2019d prefer to remain unmarried and develop a gluttonous lust for chocolate. In bed. The oysters throw a strange light on Lala\u2019s mother; you do know what they are good for, don\u2019t you?</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I have heard something of the virtues of oysters, but I believe that they need to be fresh to be efficacious in that respect. I\u2019m surprised that you have need of such a remedy, but I shall hasten to lay in an order for regular shipments whenever you are in residence.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>You injure me; truly, you do.

Soon the drawing room walls would be covered with Lyonnaise silk, hand-painted with apple blossoms. One of her favorite Italian painters would finish work in the dining room by afternoon; he had first painted it gray-green, and now he was almost done gilding the painted swallows that swooped across its walls.</p><p>India had sent Adelaide\u2014whose taste was impeachable\u2014back to London to choose furniture from Thomas Sheraton\u2019s and Jean-Henri Reisener\u2019s showrooms. They would have to accept whatever was available, but she had a very good relationship with Mr. Sheraton, in particular, and was reasonably optimistic that he would give her whatever he had and tell his customers that the pieces they\u2019d ordered had been delayed.</p> <p>A man specializing in Italian glass had arrived the day before, carting with him a true treasure: an enormous Venetian blue-glass mirror, along with the alabaster mantelpiece that would be installed after the silk was on the drawing room walls.</p><p>And she had borrowed a master gardener from Lord Pendleton\u2019s estate in the next county. (Pendleton was still very grateful to her for the successful birth of his child, in which frankly\u2014since she hadn\u2019t been the woman in labor\u2014she had played no real part.) The sound of men working in the gardens drifted through the open windows. Already the lawns had been weeded, neatly mown, and rolled smooth enough for a tennis game. The flowerbeds had desperately needed pruning; now they looked presentable, though rather bare.</p><p>When Thorn jumped from his carriage that evening, she was waiting respectably in the drawing room, rather than leaning in the doorframe like a night-walker. She had also taken the time to bathe and put on a gown without a speck of plaster or dust or paint on it.</p><p>The moment Thorn walked into the drawing room she could tell that something was wrong. His body was vibrating with pent-up emotion as he strode toward her. She started to drop into a curtsy, but he leaned forward and brushed his lips over hers. As if they were siblings. Not that she had a sibling, but she imagined they kissed like that.</p><p>\u201cWe must be quick, India,\u201d he said without further greeting. \u201cShow me the floors you\u2019ve paved in gold, and I\u2019ll be back on the road.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are not merely walking through the house and leaving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cFred plans to serve the dinner sent by the innkeeper here, if that changes your mind. We might begin in the ballroom. It turned out well.\u201d That was an understatement. The walls had been stuccoed in the faintest pink, and the decorative molding was gleaming white. She\u2019d had wall sconces installed with pale green blown-glass shades, a tint that matched the delicate chairs. She thought it was perfect.</p><p>He walked through the door, looked around, and said, \u201cIt looks good. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s mouth fell open. She put her hands on her hips. \u201cThis room is not good!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is utterly gorgeous. It is better than Versailles. It is better than any ballroom you\u2019ve seen before!\u201d</p><p>A germ of amusement lit up his eyes, which just irritated her more. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly my forte,\u201d he said, not sounding in the least apologetic.</p><p>\u201cI had workmen in here day and night! The night before last, none of us slept because\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that, his scowl matched hers. \u201cWhat do you mean, you didn\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancisco and I had to paint the stucco before it dried,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t finish painting\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cFrancisco and you?\u201d His voice dropped a level, and all that anger he was carrying in his body channeled right into his words. Maybe he wasn\u2019t as controlled as she\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cFrancisco Bernasconi,\u201d she said, holding her ground. \u201cHe\u2019s a master of stucco, the best in all England. Three or four years ago, he showed me how to do it, and now I always help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hire you to do manual labor!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m successful,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf I have to, I can bake bread. I can show a cook how to make mayonnaise and not break it. I can paint stucco, I can move furniture, I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell with that,\u201d he growled. \u201cHow old is this bloke?\u201d</p><p>India frowned. \u201cThat is irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not irrelevant. How old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarely thirty, I suppose. But his age doesn\u2019t matter: what matters is that he trained in Florence under a maestro. He\u2019s an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he\u2019s in high demand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. It was a miracle that we were able to get him here on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flared. \u201cHe came because he\u2019s in love with you. I suppose they all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancisco has never said a single inappropriate word to me, ever. You do him a huge injustice to suggest it!\u201d</p><p>He looked at her lips and then straight down her body. \u201cWere you wearing that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I wasn\u2019t wearing this gown!\u201d India was beginning to feel truly incensed. Thorn had been in a mood when he\u2019d arrived, and now he was being absurd\u2014as if he were jealous or protective, which he had no right to be.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least that\u2019s something,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she shouted at him, now losing her temper altogether. \u201cI didn\u2019t wear this gown, because I wore another gown, and what does that matter anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe watched you bend over. All night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bending over!\u201d she retorted. \u201cNot that it makes any difference.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment. \u201cIndia, tell me that you weren\u2019t on your knees.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak to that, because of course she had been on her knees. Francisco and his men worked on the upper walls, on the delicate leaf work around the moldings, and she worked below. \u201cYou are an extraordinarily rude man,\u201d she said, turning to leave. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the dining room walls, after which you can return to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose walls were painted by another Italian\u2014Manocchi, wasn\u2019t it? Did he too give up everything when you begged him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Marconi and I have worked together many times, and he is very loyal,\u201d India said, tossing her head because she didn\u2019t like his tone. She looked over her shoulder and said, with distinct satisfaction, \u201cMoreover, you paid him half as much again his usual rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is in love with you as well,\u201d Thorn stated. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that you\u2019ll just make rude remarks about the dining room, so you might as well get into your carriage now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind. I\u2019m having supper with you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll stare at the birds on the walls while we eat. I want to make sure to get my money\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Thorn\u2019s day had started badly and had become progressively worse. Rose informed him at breakfast that she hated the governess he\u2019d hired, after which she disappeared. Two hours of rising panic ensued as the household searched for her; it wasn\u2019t until Mrs. Stella unearthed her from her hiding place under his desk in the library that he knew she was safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At that point he had lost his temper, after which he felt even worse because Rose burst into tears and said that her father never shouted. He didn\u2019t doubt this was true. Will might have been stubborn, but he was always sweet-tempered.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. He was a prick, who\u2019d just behaved like a prick to a little girl who didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>They had ended up in a big chair as he rocked her back and forth and tried to explain himself. \u201cThe idea that you were lost in London made my gut turn cold. In fact, it\u2019s something of a personal triumph that I didn\u2019t curse like a sailor.\u201d</p><p>Rose raised her tearful face from his chest and said, \u201cIt\u2019s very ill mannered to congratulate oneself. Particularly when one is at fault.\u201d A little pause, and she added, \u201cDo you think that Papa was sent to heaven because he was a saint?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom what my solicitor discovered, the British militia doesn\u2019t train their men well enough. One of them made a mistake, and your father died as a result.\u201d He probably should have lied and said that Will was too good for this world. Which would have made Will roar with laughter and call him all number of names.</p><p>Once Rose was promised a governess she liked and handed back over to Mrs. Stella, Thorn went to his rubber factory, only to be told that it was impossible to produce bands of rubber large enough to hold trunks on top of a carriage. Even after three hours of trying to think their way around it, he and his manager couldn\u2019t make it work.</p><p>Yet now, here with India at Starberry Court, he was smiling. It was a miracle.</p><p>\u201cShow me the dining room, India,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI\u2019m bloody well starving to death.\u201d</p><p>It seemed that India was a flouncer when she was cross, given that she flounced her way into the dining room ahead of him, which allowed him to appreciate her truly fine curves from behind. That put him in an even better mood.</p> <p>Enough so that he poured praise on the swallows, painted by some poor dauber who was obviously in love with India, though she never noticed him. He had figured out that the proposals she\u2019d mentioned\u2014of marriage and otherwise\u2014were likely just the tip of the iceberg when it came to men in love with Lady Xenobia India St. Clair.</p><p>She should wear a warning sign on her back. Before you knew it, you\u2019d be in too deep to recover, find yourself on your knees mumbling nonsense, too taken by the way she burned with life and passion to save yourself.</p><p>He himself might have ended up in the same bind if he hadn\u2019t decided early on in life what type of woman he wanted to marry. Laetitia was exactly right. She would love him and their children in an uncomplicated way.</p><p>India, though, was complicated. Everything about her was complicated. There was even something about her childhood that he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhere is Lady Adelaide?\u201d he asked, remembering her supposed chaperone.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone to London to pick out furniture. Mr. Sheraton is far too grand to send pieces here for my consideration; Adelaide has gone to coax him into giving us pieces that he has made for others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that legal?\u201d he asked, not really caring.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d India grinned, apparently having forgotten that she was cross at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay him much more than he would have received, so everyone will be happy. Well, except the original purchasers. But he\u2019ll make them other pieces. Everything that comes from his workshop is superb. I told Adelaide that we\u2019ll take whatever he will give us.\u201d</p><p>She sat down and began removing the tops from serving dishes arranged down the middle of the table. \u201cYour kitchens should be operating very soon now. The chimneys have been repointed, and there are two new stoves. I am still negotiating with the cook, but I am hopeful.\u201d</p><p>Thorn sat down opposite her. \u201cDid Lady Adelaide know that I was coming to see the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. She asked me to give you her best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe felt no need to chaperone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour frank adoration of Lala has put you in the category of an elderly uncle. I think of it more as brotherly love. Given the way you greeted me with a kiss.\u201d</p><p>He shot her an ironic look. \u201cI have enough sisters as it is, India.\u201d</p><p>Fred carried in yet another platter. \u201cBerry tart, Lady Xenobia,\u201d he said cheerfully. Clearly he and India were now the best of friends.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Fred,\u201d India said. She turned to Thorn. \u201cDid I mention that I found a marvelous butler called Fleming, who will arrive tomorrow? Three new footmen should be in residence very soon, and Fred can continue as head footman\u2014unless you\u2019d like to take him back to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather port him back and forth with me,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cHe\u2019s a useful fellow. Just bring the food, Fred, and we\u2019ll serve ourselves. No, wait a moment! I want a bottle of that champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the house party,\u201d India protested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I waste all that wine on Laetitia\u2019s mother. I\u2019ve been to tea again since I saw you last, and the woman is a shrew.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, which meant she agreed. Hell. No wonder he had sensed Laetitia needed rescuing.</p><p>\u201cChampagne,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find bottles in the cellars, Fred,\u201d India said, putting a slice of chicken on one plate, half the bird on another, and handing him the latter. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>Thorn didn\u2019t feel like confessing that he\u2019d shouted at Rose. \u201cI spent most of it at one of my factories not far from here that manufactures galvanized rubber. We\u2019ve been trying to create a band strong enough to hold a trunk on top of a carriage, but it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you were cross when you arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not cross,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIrritable? Moody? Gnashing your teeth?\u201d</p><p>She was an imp, and the disturbing thing was that he\u2019d like to kiss her into silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018galvanized\u2019 mean?\u201d India asked.</p><p>\u201cGalvanization is a process that stops rubber from melting.\u201d He took a bite of chicken and forced his attention away from the swell of her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you make the band work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too large for our machines.\u201d Frustration leaked into his voice.</p><p>\u201cWould you be able to make a smaller band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubber is elastic, isn\u2019t it? I would love a band I could put around bundles of paper and playing cards. Would it be possible to make a band large enough to put around a box, if not a trunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless a box is extremely well made, the top allows dust to seep inside. It would be wonderful if a band would hold a box together so that the contents didn\u2019t become dusty. For example, I like to have shelving built in the attics of any house I work on, with boxes . . .\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, Thorn emerged from a haze, during which he had drilled India with questions about every possible household use for a band of rubber. He looked up from the paper on which he had been jotting down possible dimensions to find that she was smiling at him, cheek propped on her hand.</p><p>He was struck by another impulse to kiss her, this time so strong that his body froze for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m being an idiot,\u201d he muttered, shoving the paper into his waistcoat. He poured them both glasses of champagne from the bottle Fred had unearthed. \u201cLet\u2019s drink to India\u2019s band of rubber.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c \u2018Rubber band\u2019 sounds better,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his glass, quite certain that his factory would survive after this. \u201cTwenty-six men were in danger of losing employment, but your rubber bands will prevent that.\u201d</p><p>The champagne India had bought tasted like apples and had a powerful kick. He still preferred brandy, but this wasn\u2019t terrible.</p><p>\u201cEnough about rubber,\u201d he said. He realized his eyes kept drifting over her lush breasts, and his sense of self-preservation abruptly kicked in. \u201cWhat are you looking for in a husband, Lady Xenobia India St. Clair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe must be kind and very calm,\u201d she said readily to this complete non sequitur. \u201cAnd I\u2019d prefer that he do something with his life and leave me to run the household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d Thorn said with a grin, \u201che\u2019ll do something. I can promise you that.\u201d</p><p>His comment didn\u2019t seem to scandalize her in the least, perhaps because she was tipsy again. Lady Xenobia had many virtues, but an ability to handle her liquor wasn\u2019t one of them. He poured the last of the champagne into her glass and reached over to ring the bell.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that many men are incapable in private?\u201d She eyed him. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That word came out more forcefully than necessary. Even though her talk of wilted vegetables and shortfalls\u2014and now incapabilities\u2014sounded like a challenge, India was almost certainly a maiden. True, Lady Adelaide was not proving to be the most assiduous of chaperones, but an innocence about India suggested she had never succumbed to the many men who sprawled at her feet.</p> <p>\u201cMarriage is not about that,\u201d India said. \u201cMarriage is an understanding, a contract governing behavior and, hopefully, advantageous to both sides, but the advantages to each partner must be weighed. That\u2019s why I\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhy you what?\u201d Thorn asked.</p><p>\u201cI was fifteen when Adelaide asked me to organize the household of a friend of hers,\u201d she explained. \u201cI accepted payment because my father had left me nothing but a title. Without a dowry, I was unlikely to make a good match, let alone an excellent one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherefore you earned your own dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him, and Thorn felt a chill down his back. When India forgot to smile like a lady . . . He shook it off. \u201cI would say that you now have enough negotiating power to marry whomever you wish.\u201d</p> <p>She was toying with her glass, her slender fingers playing with the stem as if it were an instrument. The sight made his groin tighten, and he wrenched his attention back to the subject of her ideal spouse. \u201cThe most important consideration has nothing to do with title,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonal traits make it possible for a marriage to succeed.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cThat is very wise of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my moments.\u201d He grinned at her. \u201cI\u2019m well aware that Laetitia wouldn\u2019t suit everyone, but she\u2019s right for me. Have you met your perfect man yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m generally too busy to give men much thought.\u201d</p><p>To Thorn\u2019s mind, that was one reason she had been successful. Wives instinctively realized that India posed no threat to their marriages, even as their husbands acquiesced to her every request.</p><p>She had a Cleopatra face, the kind that made men fall on their knees. He\u2019d bet that after she gave a man the glimmering little smile she had on her lips at this very moment, he would simply give her carte blanche to do as she would with his house\u2014precisely as he himself had.</p><p>\u201cMy husband will have to be good at kissing,\u201d she said, her eyes pure, slumberous devilment. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m not very good at kissing, and I will need to marry an expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d Thorn warned. This game they were playing was dangerous.</p> <p>She wrinkled her nose at him and looked so adorable that he tossed back the rest of his champagne, letting the cold wine burn a little sanity into him.</p><p>Fred arrived with a second bottle, while India handed Thorn a slice of apple pie and took a piece of berry tart for herself. After Fred left, empty plates in hand, Thorn said, \u201cIndia, you are not bad at kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I was.\u201d But there was a little smile in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOur second kiss wasn\u2019t just good,\u201d he said, \u201cas you obviously know. It was . . .\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find the words.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m not a terrible kisser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia.\u201d</p><p>She drank more champagne and looked at him, wet lips shiny. \u201cI thought perhaps you\u2019d offer me lessons in the art, which I would refuse, of course.\u201d</p><p>Every man has limits to his self-control. Thorn stood up, walked around the table, and drew her to her feet. \u201cIndia, my kisses are appalling. Terrible. Would you offer me lessons?\u201d</p><p>She looked him straight in the eye and said, \u201cPractice makes perfect.\u201d And then she giggled. Lady Xenobia India giggled.</p><p>Thorn pulled her into his arms. \u201cYou do remember that I plan to marry Laetitia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you imagine that a kiss or two might make me want to marry you?\u201d The pure surprise in India\u2019s eyes gave Thorn a quick kick in the arse.</p><p>The daughter of a marquess would never look to one such as he, no matter how much she liked his kisses. For God\u2019s sake, had he learned nothing in his years as the bastard son of a duke?</p><p>India put her arms around his neck. \u201cWe are friends, you and I. I have no true friends, because I\u2019ve never had time for them. I never had them when I was little either, because of my parents. You are my first true friend.\u201d</p><p>Then she kissed him. She was tipsy, and a lady, and unchaperoned. . . .</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t a bad kisser.</p><p>She tasted like berry tart, like sparkling wine, like a woman . . . like India. She leaned into him, buried her fingers in his hair, closed her eyes, and let herself go. There was no tension in India\u2019s body when she kissed; she fell into the act with the same passion with which she seemed to approach everything.</p><p>It was the most erotic thing he\u2019d ever experienced. Even so, he kept a strict rein on himself. His hands slid along her arms and felt skin as smooth as satin.</p><p>He lifted up one slender arm and placed a kiss at the inner curve of her elbow. She caught her breath, so he licked her there. A small, remote voice in the back of his mind reminded him that they could only kiss.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><p>He had never paid attention to arms before. Now he put a kiss on the delicate blue veins of her inner wrist and felt himself hardening even more, as if he could come merely from the taste of her.</p><p>When he straightened, she wound her arms around his neck and began kissing him again, her tongue retreating, setting his blood on fire, dancing forward and making his mind explode with images of what she might do with that tongue. . . .</p><p>That\u2019s when he knew he had to stop. It was one thing to kiss India. She was unlike any other woman he\u2019d met: curious, brave, and independent. She was a friend. But he couldn\u2019t take it too far.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to ruin everything.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I am enclosing an invoice from Thomas Sheraton for several thousand pounds. He was kind enough to give you furniture that had been crafted for another customer; I knew that you would wish to repay his generosity by giving him a generous supplement, thus I added it to the invoice. Mr. Sheraton asked me to give you his sincere thanks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>The bill from Sheraton was crippling, but in comparison, the cost of a \u201cblue mirror\u201d was truly astonishing. Do you wish to appear blue? Do I? Is this a reference to blue blood? Do I give a damn that the mirror is Venetian? No, I do not. Return it.</p><p>Thorn</p> <p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>One does not \u201creturn\u201d a work of art. You are striving to enter the upper ranks, and you will simply have to trust me to create a worthy atmosphere.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>Return the damn mirror.</p> <p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>You\u2019ll be happy to know the mirror and mantelpiece have been installed and look splendid.</p><p>In other news, I have managed to secure you an excellent cook. I had to lure him away from Lord Pistlethorpe\u2019s household, and you will be paying him somewhat more than his normal wage. But given your boast that you are\u2014I hope I have this right\u2014more than a \u201crich bastard,\u201d I knew you would not hesitate, because excellent food can make an otherwise uncomfortable house party bearable. He arrived with his kitchen crew in tow, and I hired them as well. I trust that Lord P does not send you a challenge, but if he does, I\u2019ve no doubt you will be the victor at fisticuffs or something of that nature.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p> <p>You may keep the mirror if you could restrain yourself from filching staff from other households. I have indeed heard from Pistlethorpe, who is not pleased.</p><p>By the way, we used to call him Mortar-and-Pestle at school, owing to his nocturnal activities.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I have no idea what you are talking about with reference to Lord Pistlethorpe, and I don\u2019t wish to know.</p><p>Your new butler, Mr. Fleming, unfortunately cannot be in residence until the day before you and your parents arrive. I have also engaged four upstairs maids, two downstairs maids, a scullery maid, and a stablemaster. We are on the lookout for a bootblack and two hall boys.</p><p>The gatehouse has been cleaned, with some very basic furnishings installed, as I did not know whether you would care to hire a gatekeeper.</p><p>India</p> <p>Dear India,</p><p>I was referring to a man\u2019s wish to pleasure himself under the covers in the dark. Pistlethorpe treated his tool to a vigorous dubbing nightly in such a manner that every boy in the house knew it. Do women do the same? Were you sent to school?</p><p>I suspect that marquess\u2019s daughters are too delicate and precious to leave the parental eye, but I have no idea. My sisters were kept at home, but then we were all special cases.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>You may not write me in this manner or I shall cease to send you notice of what I am doing with your estate. I will simply forward the bills.</p><p>Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>I surmise from the irritation in your letter that ladies do not lie about at night touching their softer parts, which is a huge loss on their part. You should try it. It\u2019s greatly relaxing, and you seem prone to vexation.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I enclose the following invoices: \u00a3100 for wax candles, \u00a350 for lye soap, and \u00a3200 for gold braid.</p><p>Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>If you intend to fleece me out of house and home, at least send along a word or two to blunt the pain. Surely what I wrote was not so horrendous? I was under the impression that you and I were becoming friends, in a strange sort of way. But I am sorry if you are genuinely offended; I suppose ladies don\u2019t want to hear of such things, even in jest. What the hell is all that gold braid for?</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I have no objection to being friends if you at least attempt to be witty rather than vulgar. The gold braid trims the dining room curtains. They were hung today and they are magnificent against the silk walls.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>I\u2019m not very good at wit. It\u2019s probably to do with growing up on the streets. Can you forgive me? I didn\u2019t say that I lie about pleasuring myself while thinking of you, after all. It was merely a polite inquiry.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>Why on earth would I share such private information with you? This is a genuinely curious question.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>I know from the tenor of your letters that you do it. Put the satyr in whatever room you\u2019ve chosen. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be inspirational, and I don\u2019t want him anywhere near me. I\u2019ve no mind to look at a man\u2019s arse.</p><p>I wish I was coming to Starberry tonight to see the gold-braided curtains myself. I would try to get you tipsy again; I have fond memories of our meals together.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>India had hired a housekeeper whom she\u2019d had her eye on for some time\u2014an excellent maid working in a London house where her abilities were underappreciated. She was younger than most housekeepers, but she had a stern backbone and would stand up to her new master. And perhaps as importantly, she would be a warrior on Lala\u2019s side.</p><p>Over the years, India had realized that servants played an important part in a marriage, and not simply because a good cook made everyone in the house happier.</p><p>Lala\u2019s bedchamber was, in India\u2019s considered opinion, precisely what any lady would want. She had ignored Dautry\u2019s instructions and given her a bed with barley-twist posts, hung in pale yellow silk embroidered with pansies. There was a graceful desk under the window, where the mistress of the house could glance out across the back lawn, with a view all the way to the willow trees that graced the riverbank. The bedchamber was a refuge, a place that would echo and replenish Lala\u2019s sweetness.</p><p>She had also purchased a large Sheraton wardrobe, with shelves of different depths on which to place evening gowns, day dresses, and even a special shelf for a presentation gown.</p><p>Some parts of the estate would necessarily remain untouched, at least until the house had its own mistress. The dairies and the brewhouse were still in wretched condition; the nursery was clean, but bare; she had barely looked at the library, other than acquiring a few comfortable chairs and a few boxes of books. She meant to organize the shelves, but that would be all.</p><p>The privies were now clean, but even so she had set in motion the establishment of Bramah-designed water closets, with a float system for the water tank. She\u2019d never seen one, but she\u2019d read about them, and although they were very new, and very expensive, she determined they should be placed throughout the house, even though it would happen after the house party.</p><p>After spending a decade living in the margins between householders and servants, she had a keen understanding of the fact that life would be immeasurably better for chambermaids if chamber pots could be retired forever.</p><p>Because Dautry had given her no direction as to livery, she toyed with the idea of putting his men in a deep red, simply to vex him, but in the end she chose overcoats made of Italian wool in a blue just a touch darker than a robin\u2019s egg.</p><p>Since the gardens had been ruthlessly pruned, they could not furnish blooms to adorn the house. Her solution was to trade an exorbitant donation on the part of Mr. Dautry to the parish church, which desperately needed a new steeple, for the head gardener\u2019s freedom to take whatever he needed from the flowerbeds that stretched behind the vicarage.</p><p>Already the house was beautiful: glowing, elegant yet homelike, comfortable as well as luxurious.</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I offered the satyr to the village church, as you suggested. The vicar was so offended that you have had to make a major donation to repair the church steeple. Perhaps the Cellini should be relinquished to the Bank of England, where it could wait in a vault for your further instructions? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>Is the dower house progressing? I think Rose would like a rocking horse. She told me today that Antigone does not like the new governess (the second I hired), and when I found the time to investigate, I learned that the lady had already given her notice. We shall arrive with a nursemaid and the much-beloved Antigone.</p><p>Thorn</p> <p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I have completed the mistress\u2019s bedchamber, which means the house is very nearly ready. I was unable to find a rocking horse here; perhaps you can locate one in London? The dower house awaits Rose.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>I shall arrive in three days, Rose in tow. I sent my new butler out for a rocking horse and he found only a rocking cow. Rose thinks the cow is stupid, and I have similar concerns about the new butler. She named the cow Buttercup.</p> <p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>A good milking cow is never a bad investment; your future offspring might like her.</p><p>You will be happy to know that the privies are now functioning, and the bedchambers furnished. Yesterday Lady Adelaide and I left the Horn &amp; Stag and moved to Starberry Court.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p> <p>Did I tell you that I\u2019ve invited my friend Vander, the future Duke of Pindar, to the house party? I know the two of you are a perfect match in that you have the bluest of blue blood. Lately, I\u2019ve been thinking that I should give him advance warning. It\u2019s the least a man can do for the brotherhood.</p><p>Like wearing garlic to ward off a vampire.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I\u2019m worried that after Laetitia gets to know you a bit better, she\u2019ll choose the local doctor\u2014a very handsome young man\u2014over you. I summoned Dr. Hatfield to warn him of Lady Rainsford\u2019s imminent arrival. As you may be aware, her ladyship requires daily medical attention for any number of ailments. I promised Hatfield two pounds for each day that he dances attendance on her.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>That\u2019s probably the first expense of which I heartily approve. Here\u2019s hoping that Hatfield can keep the lady in check. I met her only twice, but I live in fear.</p> <p>Thorn</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>You really mustn\u2019t speak of your future mother-in-law in such a jocular manner. Perhaps you should begin an earnest study of polite manners. It would be a shame to do all this to the house, only to have Lady Rainsford take a virulent dislike to you. As she is bound to do if you don\u2019t play your cards better.</p><p>India</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>You are my trump card. I expect your next career will be in matchmaking. At any rate, I am just back from meeting Laetitia in Kensington Gardens, and I am too much at ease with the world to squabble with you. I am feeling like a lucky man.</p><p>All the best,</p><p>Thorn</p><p>For some irrational reason, India had kept all of Thorn\u2019s notes. She liked the way his sentences tore across the page in a strong, slanting hand. By this point, she had a quite a pile, as they\u2019d kept messengers going back and forth to London for days. But she tossed this letter in the library fireplace.</p><p>Of course, she was glad that he was happy. Thrilled. Lala would be able to coax him into displaying his dimple on a daily basis. Lala was adorable, that\u2019s what she was. Adorable the way little bunnies and babies and all the sweet little things in the world were.</p><p>These days, India felt herself to be the very opposite of adorable. She looked haggard. She was so exhausted that she felt as if a horse had ridden over her. Everywhere she looked, she saw more things that needed attending to. Indeed, as she watched Thorn\u2019s letter burn, she realized that the space over this fireplace needed a painting.</p><p>A family portrait would be perfect: perhaps Lala and her children in the garden, and Thorn leaning against a tree just behind them, with that fierce look he had, and the contained power of his body.</p><p>She shook her head, taking herself out of the room nearly at a run. She wouldn\u2019t answer his letter.</p><p>In fact, she shouldn\u2019t answer any more letters at all.</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>You will be happy to learn that I have solved the problem of the governess. I found a tutor instead, a young sprig by the name of Twink. He graduated from Cambridge about three and a half minutes ago, but he\u2019s a good fellow. He laughs, which Rose needs.</p><p>Her nursemaid\u2019s name is Clara. She\u2019s a good girl from the Highlands and will probably fall in love with Twink, but there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. They will both accompany us to Starberry C. and stay in the dower house.</p><p>Thorn</p><p>India had spent the whole of the afternoon in the library, sorting through books in order to shelve them, and she still wasn\u2019t finished. In her opinion, a library was the heart of a house. A library\u2019s book-filled shelves conveyed the impression that a family has lived in one place for generations: curious minds bequeathing their collections for their descendants to read.</p><p>Obviously, Thorn didn\u2019t have that.</p><p>Nor, it seemed, had Jupp. Either he hadn\u2019t owned many books, or an especially literate thief had ransacked the library, since most of the bookshelves had been bare.</p><p>Never mind: India had bought three large crates of \u201cmiscellaneous books\u201d from the Temple of the Muses bookshop in Finsbury Square, and they\u2019d arrived that morning. The shelves had been scrubbed and oiled; now they gleamed in the June sunlight, waiting to be filled. India began by emptying the crates and piling the books on the floor according to subject matter: literature and poetry (of which there were very few) here, military history and the like (at least fifty) over there, householdry and farming (three tall stacks) across the room. There were books of essays, books of sermons, and fourteen Bibles. (Apparently the bookseller hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d actually look at her purchases.)</p><p>When she had them sorted, she turned her attention to the books that remained of Jupp\u2019s collection in order to distribute them among the piles.</p><p>It was at that point\u2014and perhaps she should not have been surprised\u2014that she discovered his naughty books.</p><p>The first one she picked up was called Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure. That was followed by Venus in the Cloister: or, The Nun in Her Smock; The Rape of the Sabines; and The Amatory Adventures of Tilly Tucket.</p><p>\u201cTilly Tucket\u201d? What sort of name was that? India sank to the floor and opened the book at random, finding herself staring at an engraving of a frolicsome couple. Like a silly chambermaid, she gasped and slammed the volume shut, opened it again, and examined precisely what was happening.</p><p>She could feel her cheeks were pink by the time she put the book to the side; perhaps she would buy a bookshelf that locked. After one quick look at The Rape of the Sabines, she dropped that one onto a pile destined to be thrown away, followed by a few others that were equally horrid.</p><p>But then she picked up The Genuine and Remarkable Amours of a Light Gentleman and turned to the first page. The book followed the adventures of a young man called Francis Feather. \u201cFeather\u201d turned out to be not . . . feathery. In fact, she had no idea that men\u2019s parts were so large. Feather\u2019s was easily the size of his lower leg. It didn\u2019t seem anatomically possible.</p><p>The volume was lavishly illustrated, and there was definitely something riveting about the engravings. In one, for example, Feather and his inamorata were making love on a table.</p><p>She could tell it was a dining table, because a teacup and two plates had smashed on the floor, presumably owing to the frenzy of their activity. It made her think differently about household cleaning, though surely the depiction was merely there to shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adelaide had explained that these things happened under the covers, in the dark. Once in a while.</p><p>Well, maybe Adelaide hadn\u2019t specified that, but India had inferred it.</p><p>Feather observed no such restrictions: in another engraving, he was depicted on a riverbank, and when he did appear in a bed, he had a woman nestled on each side, just like the Greek statuary now residing in the attic.</p><p>At that point, India turned back and began reading the actual story. She only came to herself thirty minutes later, when the light was slanting low through the library windows. Pushing her hair behind her ears, she realized that her fingers were trembling.</p> <p>It was an interesting book, she told herself. Merely interesting. She closed it, willing herself to forget the images inside. It was just that the engravings looked so, well, erotic . . . and the women didn\u2019t appear to be shy or ashamed. They appeared to be very jolly.</p><p>Eager, even.</p><p>Though how could they possibly be? It wasn\u2019t physically possible. But there was that picture of the table, with the woman\u2019s head hanging off the edge, her hair sweeping the floor. That had to be ecstasy on her face.</p><p>It was hard to tell. India opened to the page again and turned it upside down, the better to examine the woman\u2019s face.</p><p>Her mouth was open. Was she in extreme pain, or was she experiencing pleasure?</p> <p>She was mulling this over when a noise broke her concentration and she looked up. Thorn stood in the doorway, regarding her. She slammed the book shut and scrambled to her feet, feeling like a child caught sneaking bonbons. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing here? You aren\u2019t due for two days!\u201d</p><p>Thorn raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my last two letters. I thought I\u2019d better make sure you hadn\u2019t collapsed with exhaustion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I haven\u2019t,\u201d India said, dropping her arm so the book was hidden by the folds of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been at the factory all day, so I stopped by on my way back to London.\u201d He looked around at the stacks. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not trying to organize these books.\u201d</p><p>India cleared her throat. \u201cJust in a general way, by subject. I\u2019ll put the literature in one section, histories in another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose the library is one good thing that comes from owning a country estate.\u201d He walked over to the table and picked up a book on animal husbandry. \u201cI can send out the books I have sitting around in London. They\u2019ve outgrown the bookshelves in my library and are stacked against the walls, much to my housekeeper\u2019s dissatisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>India casually slid Remarkable Amours on top of a stack of books describing travel. Thorn picked a book from another stack, and looked at its spine. \u201cAre these all books of sermons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d India said. \u201cThat stack and the one over there, and all those on the far table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJupp never fails to surprise. Get rid of those, will you? That will leave space for my London books.\u201d</p><p>India nodded. \u201cWhat books do you enjoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can get my hands on, though not sermons. What else is in here?\u201d</p><p>The naughty books came to India\u2019s mind, but she had no idea how to refer to them. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . . There is a short stack of grammar books, two of Greek grammar and three of German.\u201d</p><p>Thorn turned up the lamps fixed to the walls, and another on the mantelpiece. \u201cI suppose I can give those to Rose. She\u2019s such a solemn little thing that she\u2019ll probably work through them in a matter of a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a couple of children\u2019s books that she might like. I put them in the dower house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already made two trips to Hatchard\u2019s bookshop,\u201d he remarked casually, returning to the table and picking up a travel narrative.</p><p>India felt her insides clench. If he glanced at the next stack . . .</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would conduct such errands yourself,\u201d she said, edging closer to the questionable volume and leaning her hip against the table. In a moment, she would nonchalantly pick up the entire stack and carry it over to a shelf.</p><p>\u201cRose\u2019s governesses have barely stayed in the house long enough to unpack. But from now on, Twink can take her to the bookshop. You know, you could have simply piled these books onto the shelves.\u201d He laughed at the expression on her face. \u201cI gather you\u2019re a perfectionist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be very good at this profession if I weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd to hear a lady speak about a profession,\u201d he said, turning over yet another book.</p><p>\u201cYou must not talk to many,\u201d she said tartly. \u201cYou are surrounded by women who work very hard at various enterprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they aren\u2019t ladies,\u201d he said, with perfect truth. He turned his head and looked at her from under his lashes. \u201cAnd even more than not being ladies, they aren\u2019t daughters of marquesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about my father\u2019s title that renders me incapable of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly that\u2019s the case. But don\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re not unusual, India.\u201d He\u2019d reached the bottom of the stack of books. \u201cThis is the third book about Italy. I\u2019m starting to think that Jupp bought that Cellini in his travels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I think those books came from a bookshop,\u201d she said. \u201cI found only twenty or thirty books here, so I had to add to your library.\u201d</p><p>Thorn looked up with a bark of laughter. \u201cYou bought some poor bugger\u2019s books to make it look as if I had ancestors who knew how to read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is trying to disguise the provenance of the house and your ownership of it,\u201d she objected.</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cWe are simply demonstrating that you are a man of discernment,\u201d India told him.</p><p>Before she could stop him Thorn leaned over and picked up Feather\u2019s book. He turned the pages, an entirely wicked grin on his lips. \u201cI see that I am very discerning indeed. You are showing unexpected depths, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to Lord Jupp, you have many such volumes in your new collection,\u201d she muttered, gesturing toward the stack on the floor. She could feel color rising in her cheeks again.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Thorn said, turning the pages. \u201cThis is an adventuresome little volume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI threw a couple of them in the bin,\u201d India said defiantly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then: \u201cAren\u2019t you curious about what they were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s sickness in the world, India. I saw some of it as a boy, more as a man . . . I don\u2019t want it in my house, or anywhere near Rose.\u201d</p><p>India loved the way he was protecting Rose, so she smiled at him, a wide smile. Unguarded. Unusual for her.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cIndia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder all those men are scrabbling at your feet to marry you. You could seduce a saint with that smile.\u201d He looked back at the book and turned another page. \u201cDid you enjoy Mr. Feather\u2019s undertakings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely glanced at the volume.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked. \u201cI stood in that doorway for a good five minutes before you saw me. I was squinting, but it looked to me as if this was the picture you found most fascinating.\u201d</p><p>At that, heat flooded her body. Propriety demanded that she run from the room, but she remained where she was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorn turned the page upside down, just as she had. \u201cWhat on earth is so fascinating? Except the size of Feather\u2019s tool, which definitely falls in the category of an optimistic daydream.\u201d</p><p>India filed that comment away to think about later. Who would wish for something that large to come anywhere near her most delicate parts?</p><p>\u201cDo tell, India,\u201d Thorn said, laughing aloud now. He turned the picture the other way.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to see whether she was enjoying herself,\u201d India confessed.</p> <p>\u201cSee how her hands are flying out into the air like that? In my experience\u2014which is not slight\u2014she\u2019s having a fine time. Screaming, I would guess.\u201d</p><p>Another wave of heat concentrated between her legs. \u201c \u2018Screaming\u2019?\u201d She didn\u2019t know whether to be horrified or envious.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d he added, turning the pages. \u201cFeather is giving her everything she wants. Hell, look at this one.\u201d He glanced up, his eyes alight with mischief. \u201cShe\u2019s screaming here as well.\u201d</p><p>India looked at the engraving for a good minute before she realized what Feather was doing with his head between the lady\u2019s legs. And yes, the lady did seem to be experiencing an acute level of happiness. And her mouth was open, as Thorn noted.</p><p>She snapped to herself again. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. It\u2019s wretchedly inappropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Thorn shook his head at her. \u201cNothing wrong about it, India. You and I are friends.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her on the very edge of flight. \u201cFriends? You look at books of this nature with your friends?\u201d Frankly, it was a scandalous notion.</p><p>\u201cNo, only with you. Come take a look at what he\u2019s doing here. I\u2019ve never tried it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come to you, in that case.\u201d India rapidly backed away, until she found herself stopped by the bookcase.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see it!\u201d</p> <p>Thorn stopped just in front of her, trapping her with his large body, so close his shoulder rubbed against hers, and she could smell his spicy, fragrant male smell, even hear the sound of his breathing.</p><p>\u201cI suspect you\u2019ve had to live like a nun in order to avoid being tossed from society, haven\u2019t you? How old are you?\u201d He looked her up and down. \u201cTwenty-two?\u201d</p><p>India sighed. \u201cTwenty-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had to wrap yourself in virtuous white for twenty-six years. No wonder you\u2019re retiring. That\u2019s hellish.\u201d</p><p>His smile, she registered, was dangerous to her peace of mind. And her virtue. She cleared her throat. \u201cI must return to work, Thorn. And this conversation did not happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that nuns aren\u2019t allowed to ogle Feather\u2019s better parts?\u201d Thorn grinned at her. \u201cI like this picture; don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>India glanced down and discovered that a young lady was bouncing on top of Feather, their bodies connected only by his extraordinary . . . whatever. And they appeared to be lying on a tree limb. \u201cNo!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>He closed the book and dropped it on a shelf, leaning even closer and bracing his right arm over her head. \u201cThose pictures are exaggerations. You do know that, don\u2019t you, India?\u201d</p> <p>She scowled at him. \u201cThe matter is irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not irrelevant, because you\u2019re about to marry. During my years at Eton, I saw hordes of men starkers. I can tell you this, India: whoever you marry will not compare to Feather.\u201d</p><p>India felt, irrationally, that she should defend her future husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she objected. \u201cI\u2019m sure that he will be . . . everything that a man should be.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s grin was making that hot and muddled feeling spread all over her body. \u201cIt\u2019s really irrelevant,\u201d she repeated crossly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe before you decide on the man, I should take him for a dip in the horse pond and take a discreet glance. It would be awful if you went to your wedding night with images of Feather in mind, only to discover your beloved is the size of a thimble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? I would feel terrible if a book I owned corrupted you and consequently you never enjoyed your marital life.\u201d</p><p>India gave him a little push. \u201cBack away, if you please. I\u2019m going to my chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know; you\u2019re about to tell me again that this conversation never took place. Do you know that you\u2019re the first female friend I\u2019ve ever had?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re friends,\u201d India observed.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, what are we?\u201d</p><p>She ducked under his arm and walked away without answering, because there was no good reply to that.</p><p>He shouted when she had almost reached the door. \u201cIndia!\u201d</p><p>She turned.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot your nighttime reading!\u201d The book hurtled through the air, and she instinctively put up her hand and caught it.</p><p>That smile again.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Early the next evening</p><p>The drawing room, Starberry Court</p><p>India, darling, I insist that you go to bed early this evening,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cYou look half-dead.\u201d</p><p>India felt a pulse of pure shame. The truth was that she had stayed up far too late, absorbed in the exploits of Francis Feather. \u201cI cannot. I have only one day left before the duke and duchess join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am exhausted myself,\u201d her godmother said. \u201cI shall take supper in my room, and I recommend you do the same. When do Mr. Dautry and Rose arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning,\u201d India said.</p><p>\u201cThat young man will have to mind his language in the next week. I\u2019m astonished that dear Eleanor wasn\u2019t able to do more with him. After all, he lived in their house from an early age.\u201d</p><p>In India\u2019s estimation, it wouldn\u2019t matter at what age Thorn had entered the duke\u2019s house: it would have been too late.</p><p>\u201cOf course, he is his father\u2019s son,\u201d Adelaide continued. \u201cThose eyes are his father\u2019s, and that hair, all the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut for the personality,\u201d India pointed out. \u201cI have always found the Duke of Villiers to be as courteous as he is witty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you know Villiers only after he married. Years ago he reveled in upsetting people: imagine the scandal when he first appeared in society after bringing six illegitimate children, from five different mothers, to live under his roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that Mr. Dautry is emulating his father\u2019s footsteps by strewing children across the countryside,\u201d India said.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Adelaide walked out of the drawing room, heading for the stairs. \u201cIn my experience, people whose parents led irregular lives tend to be quite conservative. Just look at you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>India followed her up, automatically checking to make sure that every speck of dust had been removed from the shining banister. \u201cWhat have I to do with this? I am not the product of an irregular union.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are not! Your parents were married in St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral on an absolutely beautiful day, though it did rain later in the afternoon, as I recall. But they were not, shall we say, entirely traditional in their nurturing, were they?\u201d</p><p>As most parents didn\u2019t send their children out into the woods to forage for mushrooms for supper, India offered no defense of them. Still, \u201cI don\u2019t think my parents\u2019 eccentricities made me conventional,\u201d she observed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou guard your heart,\u201d Adelaide said, reaching the top and pausing. \u201cDon\u2019t you, child? You talk about choosing between your various suitors as if you were choosing dining room chairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else should I do it?\u201d India replied, stung. \u201cThat\u2019s what my father would have done, if he were alive and if he had been an entirely different man.\u201d She was all too aware that had her father still been alive, she might well have been running around his estate without proper shoes to this day, unless she\u2019d been married off to a cowherd.</p><p>\u201cWith your dowry and title, you have your choice of men. I\u2019m merely saying that you could choose on the basis of love, if you wish.\u201d Adelaide turned into her bedchamber, rang the bell, and sat down before the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cThat did not work well for my father and mother.\u201d India, who had followed Adelaide into her room, bent over and kissed her on the cheek. \u201cYou do know that it was the best day of my life when you took me in, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>Adelaide smiled, but shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best day of your life, it was the worst, because your dear parents had left you. They didn\u2019t mean to, but they left you.\u201d</p><p>Personally, India felt that parents who\u2019d spent their time being artists and worshipping the moon\u2014as opposed to ensuring that their daughter had been properly fed and clothed\u2014had left that child years before they\u2019d run away to London and died in a carriage accident.</p><p>But she also knew that Adelaide preferred to believe that the marquess and his wife had been merely flighty. Eccentric. Different.</p><p>She kissed her godmother again and went to her own room, falling onto her bed. Unfortunately, as soon as she lay down she proved to have more than enough energy to think about the way Thorn made her feel: silly, and feminine, and weak in the knees. Which was absurd.</p><p>She rolled over on her back, biting her lip. She had to stop thinking about him. He was a man who knew what he wanted, and he wanted Lala: a girl who was lovable and uncomplicated, like sunshine. And beautiful. India wasn\u2019t falsely humble about her own looks, but she didn\u2019t have Lala\u2019s perfect features and sunny blue eyes.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, India had a hard shell, built up over those lonely days while her parents had cavorted and she\u2019d been hungry and hadn\u2019t known what to do with herself. When there had been no cook, and no footmen, and nothing but a huge, decaying house.</p><p>She sighed and rang the bell to ask Marie to fetch her some supper. It was stupid to feel slighted by the fact that Thorn wanted to marry someone else.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if she wanted him, after all.</p><p>The next morning Thorn decided to ride to Starberry Court, leaving Rose, Twink, and Clara to follow in the carriage. He was well aware that he was irritable. To begin with, the rubber band machine had broken down yesterday, a disaster that followed a morning drive with Laetitia that left him a little concerned.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said a word. Not a single word. She\u2019d just sat next to him, her hands folded, as beautiful and as mute as an English rose.</p><p>India was no English rose. She was a wildflower, something brighter and uncultivated that stirred your heart with its beauty.</p> <p>Tomorrow, when Laetitia arrived for the house party, she would surely have more to say for herself. Perhaps she had simply been lulled into a companionable silence by the trotting horses, or the fresh air.</p><p>As he dismounted before Starberry Court, the great front door opened and a man\u2014clearly a butler, given his lack of gloves\u2014emerged, two footmen at his heels.</p><p>The butler bowed. \u201cMr. Dautry, my name is Fleming. Lady Xenobia engaged me to serve as your butler, should I prove satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>Thorn handed Fleming his coat and listened while the man told him that the Ladies Adelaide and Xenobia had not yet risen. After that he asked Fleming enough questions to get the lay of the house; incredibly, in all his visits he\u2019d never managed to go above the ground floor. It seemed the family chambers were situated in one wing, and the guest rooms were in the other. \u201cIsn\u2019t the nursery generally on the third floor?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia believes that modern mothers prefer a less old-fashioned arrangement,\u201d Fleming stated. \u201cHer ladyship converted a large sitting room in the family wing to a nursery, with a small attached chamber for the nanny.\u201d</p><p>Thorn headed up the stairs, thinking about India\u2019s restoration of Starberry Court. She hadn\u2019t simply painted the walls; she had actually made decisions about how he and his new family would live their lives.</p><p>He strolled into the nursery, amused to find a large rocking chair on the hearth, flanked by a smaller rocking chair and a tiny chair obviously meant for Antigone. Rose would be delighted.</p><p>What\u2019s more, India had lined an alcove with bookshelves and stocked them. Rose would love The Adventures of the Six Princesses of Babylon. He picked up a book of fairy tales and looked at the painting of Cinderella on the cover. Lala was prettier. Hell, India was prettier than that.</p> <p>Though India wasn\u2019t conventionally pretty. Not with her odd combination of white-gold hair and darker eyebrows. And the beauty mark just next to her lip. She looked like a sensual painting, like one of those Titians for which the painter used his mistress as the model.</p><p>Of course, Titian\u2019s mistresses had sleepy, placid expressions, nothing like India\u2019s. She was a pain in the arse, but something about their exchange of letters was as much fun as sparring with Vander. But subtly different\u2014probably because she was a woman.</p><p>Back in the hallway, he opened the door to the master bedchamber. He had told India that he disliked red; naturally she had papered his walls a dark crimson. Once inside, he saw she\u2019d had an alcove built there as well. But whereas Rose got books, he got the Cellini.</p><p>Strolling over to inspect, he realized that India had turned the sculpture in such a way that anyone lying in the bed had an unobstructed view of both figures, their mouths barely touching in a kiss, their bodies entwined.</p><p>There was a note stuck to the satyr\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Dear Thorn,</p><p>I tried to make this room a refuge for those of passionate sensibilities. Perhaps it will inspire you to new heights.</p><p>India</p><p>He snorted. But he pulled the note off and tucked it in his pocket. He was keeping her letters, if only for the novelty. He had never corresponded with a woman before.</p><p>The guest rooms were on the opposite side of the house. No self-respecting person would be in bed at this hour in the morning, so Thorn decided to rouse India. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess which bedchamber was hers; there was a faint trace of her perfume lingering outside the door.</p><p>Light filtered through the curtains, and Thorn could see that the bed was hung in translucent amber silk; he only barely made out a sleeping figure through it. Pulling back the bed curtain gave him a peculiar feeling, as if he were discovering an enchanted princess. Like one of the stories India had bought for Rose.</p><p>She was curled on her side, all that pale hair of hers spread across the pillow. Surprisingly, she looked sweet in her sleep. But still erotic: her lips were naturally ruby colored, and he could just see her beauty mark. It was a mark that made a man look harder at her lower lip, made him dream about what that mouth could do.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>The funny thing was that looking down at her now made him think back to when he was a mudlark, before the Duke of Villiers had come out of nowhere and declared himself to be his father. He had never seen a woman with skin like India\u2019s, like the inside of a flower petal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t even known such women existed. As the daughter of a marquess, India was everything he wasn\u2019t, and everything he would never be. All that privilege and birth was bred in the bone, and it showed in her face.</p><p>With a sudden surge of irritation, Thorn sat on the bed, expecting the motion would wake her. She opened her lips and made a funny little huffing noise, flung an arm above her head, and slept on.</p><p>Once, when he was a boy and it was cold, just beginning to snow, he\u2019d seen a girl in a warm woolen coat whose mother had held out her hand and said, \u201cCome on, sweetheart.\u201d The girl hadn\u2019t even seen him, but she\u2019d walked away with all the love he\u2019d never known.</p><p>No wonder sitting beside India made him feel every inch the mudlark. She\u2019d had all that: all that money and gloss and love and protection.</p> <p>He reached out and shook her shoulder, and not terribly gently either.</p><p>She opened her eyes, and the look in them went straight to his cock. She had a hazy look about her, as if she\u2019d just made love for hours. As if she was waking after a night of it, and she wanted still more.</p><p>As if . . .</p><p>Her eyes popped open all the way and she sat up. His hand went over her mouth. \u201cPlease don\u2019t scream. God knows the last thing either one of us wants is for you to be compromised. I will never marry a woman just because society thinks I ought to.\u201d His voice came out harder than it should have.</p><p>He dropped his hand.</p> <p>Her eyes had lost that hazy sweet look, and for a second he felt a pulse of regret. Instead, she was glaring at him. \u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d she hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare think that because you employ me, you have the right to personal services!\u201d She began to grope around behind her.</p><p>Outrage surged up his back. \u201cYou think I would come to your bedchamber for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first!\u201d she snapped. She brought up her arm, and damned if she wasn\u2019t wielding a club, covered in flowered flannel. \u201cTouch me again and I\u2019ll hit you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn iron bar that I will use on your skull if you don\u2019t get off my bed and out of my room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that some man dared to enter your bedroom and accost you? Is that what you\u2019re saying, India?\u201d Their eyes met, and he reached out and took the weapon away, weighing it in his hand. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t do very much. It wouldn\u2019t stop a man who was truly determined.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt did what it had to,\u201d India replied proudly.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d He knew his voice came from his throat like a gunshot. \u201cWho did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business!\u201d She picked up all that gorgeous hair of hers and swept it behind her shoulders. \u201cNow, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He bent over and growled it, right in her face. \u201cIndia, who dared to come into your bedroom and frighten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides you?\u201d But she added, \u201cSir Michael Phillips. I struck him in the ear with my iron bar.\u201d Her smile made her eyes light up. \u201cHe complained the next day that he had lost his hearing and wouldn\u2019t be able to sing in tune!\u201d</p><p>Thorn fought back another growl. The bastard was going to be taking the castrato part once he got his hands on him. But there was no need to disclose that fact to India.</p> <p>\u201cPhillips, who has a house in Porter Square? Went to Oxford? Silly little beard that only covers half his chin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, pushing more hair behind her shoulders. \u201cAdelaide and I visited his mother, because she had influenza. After she was out of danger, he seemed to believe that I would take care of him as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone else do that?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him, so he put it a different way. \u201cWhere did you get the idea of the iron bar, India?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy godmother keeps one just like it in her bed when she\u2019s traveling. In an inn, for example. A woman should always be prepared.\u201d</p><p>If a woman didn\u2019t have a man sleeping at her side, she probably should have an iron bar. In fact, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea. In fact . . . he might be able to make bars for just this purpose.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cManufacturing iron bars, for the self-defense of ladies,\u201d he said readily. \u201cI have a factory that could make them. We could use scrap metal. Perhaps with a slender end for women with smaller hands.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment, then broke into laughter. \u201cIs that how you made your untold millions?\u201d</p><p>God, she was gorgeous. Dangerously so. He wrenched his mind back to the reason he\u2019d invaded her privacy. \u201cIndia, would you care to explain what that statue is doing in my bedchamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like your room?\u201d she asked, a naughty smile glimmering in her eyes.</p><p>In fact, he did like it. And she knew it. \u201cThe walls are red,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThe devil should have a lair that suits his disposition,\u201d she replied, obviously unperturbed. \u201cA background, you might call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to change it.\u201d</p><p>India shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m finished appointing the house. Your guests begin to arrive tomorrow, and I must ensure that Lala\u2019s mother adores you, which frankly will be a bigger challenge than the whole house put together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedchamber aside, India, you did a hell of a job. The place is dazzling.\u201d</p><p>She sat up straighter, and a hank of her hair fell over her breast. The lock was long and curly, and the breast was as lush and delectable as it appeared when she was dressed, though she tended to wear gowns with all the appeal of a governess\u2019s.</p><p>He had to get out of her bedchamber. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, jumping to his feet. \u201cI\u2019d better go prepare for Rose\u2019s arrival. She\u2019ll be along in the carriage presently.\u201d</p><p>For one second, India looked disappointed, but then she said regally, \u201cYou ought never to enter a lady\u2019s chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVander arrives tomorrow,\u201d he told her, ignoring her rebuke. \u201cThat\u2019s Lord Brody, future duke. Don\u2019t wear that dress I last saw you in. Haven\u2019t you any gowns that might seduce a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to seduce Lord Brody!\u201d India said, brows drawing together like a thundercloud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m friends with Vander, but I can\u2019t guarantee that he\u2019s anything much in bed,\u201d Thorn said, grinning. \u201cIf you like his looks you should try the merchandise first. I\u2019ve never been partial to tow-heads, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ignoring you.\u201d India swung her feet out of bed and poked around with her toes for her bedroom slippers. She had the prettiest feet he\u2019d ever seen: slender and white and silky looking. And her ankles were as delicate as the rest of her.</p><p>An image of the scars that slashed across his thighs popped into his mind. Her head bent as she poked her feet into her little slippers; all he could see was her incredible hair.</p><p>She straightened up. \u201cYou must leave now. Marie, my maid, will arrive soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she simply walk into your room in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have to change that once you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t even glance at him as she went to the dressing table. He didn\u2019t like to be ignored, so he said, \u201cVander might be a morning man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned around as she pulled on a dressing gown, and he saw faint puzzlement in her eyes. \u201cA man rolls over in the morning and finds himself ready,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe wakes up hungry, and if there\u2019s a soft body next to him, he\u2019ll make her a happy woman. Which he would want to do without a maid interrupting.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed pink. Thorn grinned and decided to leave with that thought. He got himself out of the bedroom and downstairs to alert Fleming to the existence of Rose\u2014only to discover that India had informed him about everything, including the need to keep Rose\u2019s presence in the dower house a secret for the time being.</p><p>He spent a half hour poking around the kitchens, butler\u2019s pantry, silver closet. \u201cWhere the hell did she get all this stuff?\u201d he asked Fleming, staring into a closet full of silver platters. Some had great domed lids; some, little feet.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia is acquainted with Messieurs Hannam &amp; Crouch. She trusted me to visit their store on Monkwell Street and acquire the basics for a household of this size.\u201d</p> <p>Thorn picked up one of the platters, one without fussy little feet. Of course, he\u2019d seen silver like this on his father\u2019s table. The duke did not believe in hiding his silver under a barrel, as it were.</p><p>But he had never thought about owning any himself. The piece he had in hand was an oval with some decoration.</p><p>\u201cThis seems good enough,\u201d Thorn said.</p><p>\u201cThe platter has a gadrooned border, and the field is engraved with a diaperwork pattern,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cA crest could be added at a later date, should you wish for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might as well get to know me, Fleming. The answer to that is, when hell freezes over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuite right, sir,\u201d the butler replied, without flicking an eyelash. He took the platter and handed it to the footman, who had been trotting after them like a puppy. \u201cPut this in my pantry, Stevens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have handled it, and the platter must be polished before use.\u201d</p><p>Thorn was losing interest in silver. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn whether it\u2019s polished or not, as long as it has food on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gained that impression, sir, when you paid Hannam &amp; Crouch, although they neglected to send you an inventory of the objects you had bought.\u201d Fleming\u2019s tone was wry; Thorn suspected they would get on very well.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou realize I\u2019m a bastard? It gave my butler in London indigestion, until at last he left for the good of his immortal soul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI too am a chance-child, as we call it in the Highlands,\u201d Fleming said.</p><p>Thorn broke into a crack of laughter. \u201cHow in hell did she find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have served under the Marquess of Pestle, and most recently as head footman to the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, she stole you from my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in service knows of Lady Xenobia. If a man would like to move households, he hopes, if not prays, that she will pay the house a visit. I met her two years ago, when she spoke to every person in His Grace\u2019s household. She did not forget my ambition to be a butler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she always speak to every person in service?\u201d</p><p>Fleming nodded. \u201cFrom the butler to the scullery maid. You can imagine that she learns quite a bit about the household.\u201d</p><p>She was brilliant, that woman.</p> <p>As Thorn entered the library, the image of India in her bed came back into his head. He would have guessed that ladies wore white flannel to bed, perhaps with a bit of lace around the neck and the wrists. To cover up.</p><p>India had been wearing pale blue silk. And there had been a lot of lace, and it hadn\u2019t been doing much to cover anything up.</p><p>A crunch of carriage wheels interrupted that interesting train of thought, so he went out to greet Rose. She climbed down, clutching Antigone and looking uncertain. He probably should have traveled with her, even though Twink and Clara were descending from the carriage as well.</p><p>Thorn stopped and held out his arms. \u201cRose!\u201d</p><p>Her face was tight, and he waited while she thought about it. Finally, she trotted toward him, and he scooped her up. \u201cHow\u2019s my girl?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI am not your girl,\u201d she said, with that awkward earnestness that characterized her.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly are,\u201d he said. \u201cOn loan from your papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked unconvinced. Thorn had never had trouble persuading members of the female sex to like him. Until, that is, he met Rose. She held herself apart, no matter how much he tried to charm her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re off to the dower house,\u201d he told her, hating that fact. He understood the necessity, but it didn\u2019t suit him to hide Rose away, as if she were someone to be ashamed of. It made her seem like a by-blow, whereas she was the perfectly legitimate product of holy matrimony.</p><p>But when he had informed Laetitia about Rose and the dower house, she had nodded instantly. \u201cMy mother is . . . difficult,\u201d she said, her voice barely above a whisper. He knew what she was really saying: she needed him to rescue her, and he would.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lady Xenobia?\u201d Rose asked now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the house, I expect,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cWould you like to see her?\u201d</p><p>Rose nodded vigorously. \u201cI know that she will want to see the progress that Antigone has made.\u201d</p><p>Thorn glanced at Fleming.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia will undoubtedly join you in the dower house, Miss Rose,\u201d the butler said. \u201cFor a visit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Miss Laetitia Rainsford was supervising as her mother\u2019s maid packed Lady Rainsford\u2019s trunk for transport to Starberry Court. This was not because Abigail needed supervision but because her mother insisted, and Lala had learned long ago that it was easier to do as her mother willed than try to resist it.</p><p>\u201cTake care with that gown,\u201d Lady Rainsford said, from where she reclined on a day bed across the room. \u201cThat is Valenciennes lace on the sleeves.\u201d</p><p>Abigail already knew that, and always took care. But Mama liked to catalogue the valuable things in her possession. Almost as much as Mama liked to catalogue her ailments. But not quite as much as Lala liked to make unkind comments in the back of her head, where no one could hear them.</p><p>It was a sin, and she knew it. She nodded, and said, \u201cYes, Mama,\u201d and watched as Abigail painstakingly folded the gown between lengths of white silk to keep the lace from snagging or wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still unsure about this visit,\u201d her mother said fretfully. \u201cA bastard, to call a spade a spade! My daughter marrying a child of shame. Who would have thought it? Not I, not when I was the most beautiful woman in the ton, and I chose your father to wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry is the son of the Duke of Villiers,\u201d Lala ventured to say, not for the first time, nor even for the tenth.</p><p>\u201cWho is as scandalous as his offspring,\u201d her mother said, raising a hand limply in the air and letting it fall. She had applied a paste of cucumber and fuller\u2019s earth, guaranteed to eradicate all wrinkles, to her face that morning. It had dried solid, and now it had begun crackling like the bed of a dried-out pond.</p><p>\u201cYour father should be appalled at the very idea of linking his blood with such an immoral man as Villiers, let alone a bastard slip from the tree.\u201d</p><p>Abigail had finished the gown and was placing a last layer of silk on top before closing the trunk\u2019s lid. \u201cPapa is quite impressed with Mr. Dautry\u2019s holdings,\u201d Lala reminded her mother. She had been repeating two concepts over and over: \u201cduke\u201d and \u201cwealth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she dared not utter any of the things she\u2019d like to say, which included pointing out that no one considered her more than a pretty face, if not a dunce. And that her father was weary and gaunt with anxiety about money. And that he needed Lala to marry quickly, and not cost him another season.</p><p>Frankly, her mother should have been kissing Mr. Dautry\u2019s feet. It was a miracle she\u2019d met Mr. Dautry, given that he hadn\u2019t attended the usual events of the season. He\u2019d never seen her stumbling along in a conversation, trying to find the right words, trying to come up with something witty or even merely fitting, and failing. She would try to say something, and her face would begin to feel tight and she could feel color creeping up her neck.</p><p>But Mr. Dautry didn\u2019t seem to expect her to be clever, which made it all easier. He was so interesting that she found herself actually paying attention to what he said.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a man she would have selected if she\u2019d been given a choice. She liked men who were far less aggressive and masculine. For almost two years before she\u2019d debuted, she had been infatuated with their vicar, who had a slender, intelligent face and no hair on his head at all. She attended church so regularly that her mother started calling her Goody Two-shoes.</p> <p>\u201cDautry is rich,\u201d her mother said fretfully. \u201cBut who would have thought that I, I, would have to sell my daughter in the open marketplace to a bastard with a purse of gold? My exquisite daughters should have been snatched up by the highest in the land the moment they debuted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariah had four excellent offers,\u201d Lala reminded her, ringing the bell to summon footmen to collect the trunk.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s clayey face cracked into a smile at the memory. \u201cYes, Mariah is a true beauty. What a wonderful season she had! Everyone was whispering about her, casting wagers about who she would accept . . .\u201d</p><p>Lala didn\u2019t know why there had been any speculation: her father had simply accepted the largest offer for Mariah\u2019s hand. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t think that any of the men who had proposed to Lala had offered adequate recompense for her beauty. Instead, he held out for a better offer\u2014and then the season was over.</p><p>The very thought of having to endure another season made her heart pound. If Mr. Dautry didn\u2019t marry her, she\u2019d have to go through all of it again, knowing everyone was whispering about her, not because she was beautiful but because they thought she was a simpleton.</p> <p>She had even overheard some girls giggling and calling her \u201ca spoony Sally.\u201d She hadn\u2019t entirely understood what they\u2019d meant\u2014who was Sally?\u2014but it was obviously no compliment.</p><p>Abigail opened the bedchamber door and stood back, letting the footmen fetch Lady Rainsford\u2019s trunk. It would be sent on immediately, allowing the gowns to be aired and re-ironed before they followed tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI just wish you would be a little more vivacious, Lala,\u201d her mother went on, taking no notice of the men\u2019s presence. Lady Rainsford was not one to notice servants unless she wanted them to do something for her. \u201cThough to be fair, it\u2019s hardly your fault that you\u2019re daft, but you could do something about your hips.\u201d</p><p>Lala clenched her teeth and willed herself not to cry. It would be ridiculous to get teary simply because two footmen were watching.</p><p>\u201cIt gives you such a lubberly air,\u201d her mother went on relentlessly. \u201cI swear it would be easy. If you would just stop eating for a couple of weeks, you could have the same slim figure as your sister. We wouldn\u2019t be scraping the bottom of the barrel like this, lowering ourselves to visit the house of a by-blow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers will attend the party, Mother,\u201d Lala said, adding with some desperation, \u201cand I\u2019m certain that he will be greatly offended if you allow your feelings about his son to be evident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one can say that I\u2019m not the soul of tact,\u201d her mother said, with a blithe disregard for the truth. \u201cAbigail, I\u2019ll thank you to shut the door after the footmen. There\u2019s a draft coming in that will likely go to my lungs and finish me off before I manage to get my last daughter off my hands.\u201d</p><p>She swung her legs from her bed and pointed to her silk wrapper. Lala draped it around her mother\u2019s bony shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI should like a tisane, brewed with a touch of honey. Meanwhile, it is time for you to take a brisk walk around the park. Three times a day, remember, and you haven\u2019t even been out of doors today. It\u2019s already ten in the morning. Laziness is the downfall of your figure.\u201d</p><p>Lala had been dancing attendance on her mother since daybreak, but she bit back a comment. There was no point. No point.</p><p>She kept repeating that to herself until she was out the door and heading to Kensington Gardens.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I need a bonnet,\u201d India told her maid, Marie, after Fleming conveyed Rose\u2019s wish that she pay a visit to the dower house. She never went out of doors with a bare head; it was one of the rules she had read in a book about being a lady. In the absence of maternal advice, she had practically memorized the book at an early age.</p><p>A short time later, she was walking down a gravel path, cursing herself for having chosen such an elegant\u2014and thus tiny\u2014hat. The warm breeze was already teasing her hair out of its place; she could feel tendrils around her neck. And with her hair, that meant the whole thing would fall apart by the time she reached the dower house.</p> <p>She was about halfway to her destination when she encountered Thorn and Rose, strolling hand in hand on the path. Thorn held a child\u2019s hoop in his other hand.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d he said, quite as if he hadn\u2019t been sitting on her bed a mere hour ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see you.\u201d</p><p>Rose curtsied and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you again, Lady Xenobia.\u201d</p><p>India wrenched her eyes away from Thorn\u2019s face\u2014he was the sort of man who commanded all one\u2019s attention\u2014and looked down at the child. Of course, she was still wearing mourning black.</p><p>But this time India saw no resemblance to Thorn. Instead, she saw grief lingering in Rose\u2019s eyes. She knelt down and said, \u201cGood morning. How is your friend Antigone this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not a friend,\u201d the child replied with dignity. \u201cShe is my doll, but I pretend that she is my ward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather that Antigone has lost her mama and her papa,\u201d India said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. She looks very elegant in her beautiful pelisse, although perhaps a little sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t had a mama for a long time,\u201d Rose said. \u201cBut she is lucky to have me. That makes her lucky, lucky as a lark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother and father died as well,\u201d India said, responding less to Rose\u2019s reply than to the emotion in her eyes. \u201cI still miss them. It does get better, though it never really goes away.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s lips pressed together in a way that India recognized: she, too, had realized quite young that crying didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cI see that Mr. Dautry is carrying a hoop,\u201d India said. \u201cAre you very good at rolling it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rose replied. \u201cI do not have the control to make it stay up. I told Mr. Dautry this, but he bought it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quite adept with a hoop,\u201d India said, straightening up. \u201cShall we try together? We can leave Antigone with Mr. Dautry. Do you have the dowel? Excellent! Now we must find a nice flat bit of path, because even the faintest bump will send it spinning off into the grass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAntigone and I shall find our way back to the dower house and await you,\u201d Thorn said gravely.</p><p>By the time she and Rose bowled their way back to the dower house, India\u2019s hair had tumbled down her back, and her cunning Italian shoes were pinching her toes. But never mind: Rose\u2019s cheeks were pink, and she was talking so much that India hadn\u2019t said more than a word for the last five minutes.</p><p>India limped up to the front door and pushed it open, ushering Rose in before her. The entry led directly into a small, cozy sitting room, where they found Thorn reading a newspaper.</p><p>Rose ran to him, leaned against his knee, and told him of her last, triumphant bowl, in which the hoop had rolled all the way down the path until a tiny rock had sent it askew. He put the paper aside immediately, wrapped an arm around her, and bent his head to listen. It was such a tender scene that India\u2019s heart caught.</p> <p>Characteristically, Thorn hadn\u2019t stood up as she entered, the way a gentleman ought. Instead, he looked her over, then drawled, \u201cIt looks as if you ran around the house three times backwards, India.\u201d</p><p>Rose said in an urgent whisper, \u201cMr. Dautry, you must rise in the presence of a lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is just what I was thinking,\u201d India said, unpinning her little hat.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she\u2019s a lady?\u201d Thorn asked, rising. \u201cShe\u2019s all pink in the face, and her hair is a mess. In fact, she looks a fright.\u201d His eyes were alight with teasing laughter. \u201cDear me, Lady Xenobia. Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ll try to seduce Vander with that gown. You look like an old maid put by in lavender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a most objectionable comment,\u201d Rose exclaimed, before India could say anything. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s not enough to stand up; you must also bow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI generally don\u2019t bother,\u201d he said carelessly. \u201cAnd Lady X knows it. I promise I\u2019ll be gentlemanly around Laetitia, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry hopes to marry Miss Laetitia Rainsford,\u201d Rose told India, putting her hoop to the side. \u201cI have been trying to give him the benefit of my advice, because my tutor was quite knowledgeable about matters of deportment and rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my dismay, I\u2019ve discovered that my ward could hire herself out as a governess tomorrow,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cLady Xenobia, your face is as red as a tomato, if you don\u2019t mind my saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hot outside,\u201d India said, frowning at him as she took a seat. \u201cAnd before Rose feels the need to correct you again, I\u2019ll point out that it\u2019s quite impolite to compare a lady to a vegetable or, indeed, make her feel inadequate in any way.\u201d</p><p>Thorn dropped into a chair. \u201cWhy should you feel inadequate merely because you are an attractive shade of red?\u201d</p><p>Rose looked from Thorn to India. \u201cI am going to put my hoop away in my room. I shall ask Clara to bring some lemonade, Lady Xenobia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have charge of a very interesting little person,\u201d India said, after Rose left.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a dowager duchess in the making.\u201d Thorn stretched out his legs and put his clasped hands behind his head. \u201cSeriously, India, is that what you intend to wear tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we had agreed that you should entice Vander, otherwise known as the future duke?\u201d</p><p>India stared at him. Somehow they\u2019d fallen into a relationship that she\u2019d never imagined having with a man, not ever. Perhaps it was like a brother and sister. Except . . . occasionally she glanced at him and he was so handsome that it made her shiver all over. \u201cDo you speak to your siblings this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they find you as maddening as I do?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, and her annoyance went up two more notches. She, who had learned to keep calm in the face of domestic chaos, was always losing her temper around him. It was infuriating.</p> <p>\u201cMy siblings adore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdd,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss your gown. It\u2019s more interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we discuss what you will wear instead?\u201d She looked him over, nice and slow, to make her point. \u201cLady Rainsford will not appreciate that woodsman look you\u2019ve adopted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall throw on some decent clothes tomorrow. At the last minute.\u201d When Thorn was amused, his voice dropped and took on a rough edge that made him sound even less gentlemanly.</p><p>\u201cRose looks much better,\u201d India said, changing the topic to something less provocative. \u201cLess drawn and less frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI force her to eat apple tart for breakfast,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cThough what she really likes are Gunter\u2019s ices. Every afternoon.\u201d</p><p>India smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I do to deserve that?\u201d Thorn asked, looking both quizzical and completely unmoved.</p><p>\u201cAnyone would be happy to see how well you care for your ward,\u201d India said. \u201cYour mother would be\u2014\u201d She broke off, realizing she had no idea who Thorn\u2019s mother was or what she would like.</p><p>\u201cNever met her,\u201d Thorn said promptly. \u201cShe was an opera singer, and presumably not maternal by nature, given that she left me behind with Villiers\u2014clearly not a model father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your mother like?\u201d he asked.</p><p>An image of the marchioness flashed through India\u2019s mind, her hair long and free, dancing naked under the moon. What was there to say? \u201cShe was quite original.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, she was mad as a March hare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unkind assessment,\u201d India said. She raised her chin defiantly.</p><p>\u201cI investigated your background after I knew you would be around Rose,\u201d he explained. \u201cBefore that, I had decided that anyone calling herself Lady Xenobia was obviously a crook, so I didn\u2019t bother to inquire about your antecedents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first to have deduced that from my name,\u201d India conceded.</p><p>\u201cWhat father names his child Xenobia, instead of Margery or Blanche?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that madmen are not as parental as one might wish,\u201d he said, leaping into the silence.</p><p>\u201cMy mother had a tendency to forget I existed,\u201d India heard herself saying. She\u2019d never told anyone that uncomfortable truth. It wasn\u2019t just that people would feel sorry for her; keeping silent made it feel less real. \u201cBut she did love me,\u201d she added. She always told herself that.</p><p>\u201cMy mother did not feel the same toward me,\u201d Thorn said easily. \u201cAccording to my father, she thought I was a pretty baby, though. I looked better in those days, or she had a temporary flash of maternal feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left you in a warm, safe place where you would be cared for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that.\u201d</p><p>He had his arms stretched across the back of the sofa, and he was so good-looking that India\u2019s heart skipped a beat. It was stupid, but there was something wonderful about the way he had made himself into Rose\u2019s father. He would never leave behind a child of his.</p><p>\u201cMy parents died in London,\u201d she went on. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know they were there or why they had left home.

My father was driving the curricle because we didn\u2019t have a coachman, and he went off Blackfriars Bridge. From what they told me, he tried to rescue my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of them survived?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed, feeling the same old lump of grief going down her throat again. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have wanted to live without her.\u201d It was stupid, stupid, stupid, to feel that her father should have wanted to live for her. Half the time he didn\u2019t even remember she was alive.</p><p>Thorn reached out and grabbed her wrist. Then he pulled her forward, and she toppled onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He wound his arms around her, and India stopped thinking about her parents.</p><p>\u201cYour father and mother should have told you they were leaving,\u201d he said into her ear. \u201cThey should have wanted to make sure you were safe. I can see that they weren\u2019t wonderful parents. But I am absolutely sure that they loved you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you know?\u201d India said, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the Thames a thousand times,\u201d he said. \u201cThe water is murky at the best of times, and it would have been stirred up by the carriage and horses. A person gets turned around trying to swim in the muck, and there\u2019s a wicked current slashing around the curve just past that bridge. Boys would dive down and never come up, and we never knew what had happened to them.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s eyes were prickling, and she turned her cheek against his shoulder. \u201cI\u2014I think they might have been leaving home for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had no money, but my mother did have some jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou implied once that you had been hungry as a child. They allowed you to go without food, although they had jewelry they could have sold?\u201d His voice was incredulous.</p> <p>\u201cThe set was given to my mother by her grandmother,\u201d India explained. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t sell it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could,\u201d Thorn said bluntly. \u201cShe should have.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s mouth wobbled. She had thought that sometimes, but it was terribly disloyal. \u201cShe planned to give them to me. Except she must have changed her mind, because they took them to London, and obviously they were going to sell them. I realized later that they must have decided to go to the Barbados. They always talked of it.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened around her, and he asked, \u201cWhere was Lady Adelaide during your childhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was married and living in London. She had no idea what it was like in the country.\u201d India used to dream that a fairy godmother would arrive, bringing beautiful gowns, or perhaps just a clutch of eggs . . . but it never happened. One day rolled into another, and when one was worrying about food and the coming winter, anxiety made the days blur together. There were whole years of her childhood that she couldn\u2019t quite remember.</p><p>Anguish tightened in her chest. Thorn must have realized, because he dropped a kiss on her hair just as the first sob struggled out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI n-never cry,\u201d she gasped five minutes later.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he whispered, his deep voice as soothing as the caress of his hand on her back. \u201cThere are parents who make terrible decisions, India, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love their children. I do not believe for a moment that your parents scooped up those jewels, planning to leave you behind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFather loved the idea of sailing for Barbados,\u201d India whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey would not have left without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did they take the jewels? They were kept behind a loose stone in the fireplace. When Adelaide came to take me away, I went to retrieve them. And\u2014and they were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they were stolen,\u201d Thorn suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, Father had taken their leather bag as well. It wouldn\u2019t fit behind the brick, so it was always left in a drawer in the side table. No thief would have known that.\u201d She drew in a ragged breath. \u201cFor some reason, they took the jewels and left before daybreak without saying goodbye. But I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m used to it now.\u201d</p><p>Thorn didn\u2019t believe she was. He had never known his mother, and even so, the fact that she\u2019d abandoned him had left a sting. India\u2019s parents sounded even more irresponsible. \u201cThey loved you, and they wouldn\u2019t have left the country without you,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly say that with such certainty?\u201d She was starting to sound a little cross, which he took to mean that she was coming back to herself.</p><p>He\u2019d bet his fortune that her parents fell in love with her the moment they saw her. But love alone didn\u2019t make people good parents. He had a shrewd sense that Vander\u2019s mother had loved him, but you couldn\u2019t convince Vander of it.</p><p>\u201cBecause you are who you are,\u201d he said, smiling even though she had her cheek pressed to his shoulder and couldn\u2019t see his face. India hadn\u2019t the faintest idea how many people loved her, from her parents to Adelaide, to her workmen, to all those men who had asked her to marry them. . . .</p><p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d she snapped, sounding more like herself. \u201cThey should have woken me and told me where they were going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I told you all that,\u201d she said, sighing and straightening up. \u201cI\u2019ve never mentioned it before. It seems disloyal to their memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven what is already known about your father, I doubt that anyone would offer praise of his parenting skills,\u201d Thorn said dryly. \u201cI take it the jewels were not found on their bodies or in the carriage?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou never told your godmother? No one instituted a search for the jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s disbelief must have shown in his face.</p><p>\u201cAdelaide was wracked with guilt after my parents\u2019 death,\u201d India said defensively. \u201cBecause she hadn\u2019t visited in more than a decade, she had no idea about the state of our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have taken much to hire a Bow Street Runner to look into the matter,\u201d Thorn pointed out, making a mental note to do just that himself. If the Runner found nothing to report, India need never know.</p><p>\u201cMy godmother lives in a cheerful world. She works hard to keep it that way. And she deserves it, because her marriage wasn\u2019t very happy.\u201d</p><p>Thorn was on the verge of saying something extremely impolitic about godmothers who didn\u2019t protect their godchildren, when India gently pushed away his arm and rose to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI must wash my face before Rose returns.\u201d But she turned around at the door and gave him one of her smiles, the kind that shone from her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re such a good friend, Thorn,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She left him thinking about the ways he wasn\u2019t a good friend.</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>Upstairs, India stared at herself in the glass. Her hair was disheveled, her eyes were swollen, and her throat felt scratchy from all that crying, but all the same . . . she felt a weight had lifted. It was stupid, but it was a relief to have told Thorn. The cold, squeezed part of her heart had eased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made her feel warm and safe for the first time in years.

I think you\u2019ll be comfortable here. I shall stop by every day and see if there\u2019s something I can bring you and Antigone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Twink and I are working on English grammar, because he says it\u2019s important to learn that before turning to Greek,\u201d Rose reported.</p><p>India felt a little pulse of jealousy, which was entirely absurd.</p><p>She glanced over Rose\u2019s head. \u201cThorn, will you return to the house before supper?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with Rose as long as I can, if only to make sure that Twink doesn\u2019t drown her in past participles.\u201d</p><p>India had no idea what those were, so she merely nodded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to hunt out a better gown for tomorrow, India,\u201d he ordered.</p> <p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think Lady Xenobia looks quite nice,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>\u201cShe looks like a nice nun,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cShe needs to go a different direction in order to catch Vander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sometimes call each other India and Thorn, and other times, Lady Xenobia and Mr. Dautry?\u201d Rose demanded. \u201cIt isn\u2019t proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re quite good friends,\u201d Thorn said easily. \u201cThe best of friends, in truth.\u201d</p><p>India felt a wobbly smile on her mouth. He was right, of course. She had no other friend like him in the world.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Informality is the vice of the masses,\u2019 \u201d Rose announced.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s bells, who told you that?\u201d Thorn asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy former tutor, Mr. Pancras,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>Thorn snorted. \u201cThat man is quickly becoming my worst enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf people call me Rose, and you Thorn, then we are Rose and Thorn.\u201d The child curled her lip in disdain. \u201cI prefer Mr. Dautry. It\u2019s far more dignified.\u201d</p><p>India smiled at her. \u201cI like Rose and Thorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not agree,\u201d Rose replied, quite politely. \u201cBut I realize that I am too young to be heard on the subject.\u201d</p><p>At that, Thorn burst out laughing, and India slipped out of the house while he was tickling his ward.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Late that afternoon, India finished the final preparations for the arrival of the guests. The Duke and Duchess of Villiers were due to arrive in the morning, with Lord Brody, Lady Rainsford, and Laetitia following in the afternoon or early evening. It seemed that Lord Rainsford would not come at all; Adelaide had discreetly confirmed that the lord and lady were only rarely to be found under the same roof.</p><p>All chambers were aired and ready; flowers would be placed in each room first thing in the morning. Between India, Fleming, and the housekeeper, they had planned the week like a military operation.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess will serve as Mr. Dautry\u2019s hostess,\u201d India reminded Fleming, checking through a list of wines that would be offered.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d the butler said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there will be any number of crises, and you may come to me if you must. But please make sure that the other guests don\u2019t know, Fleming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not, my lady. Lady Adelaide will take supper in her room again tonight,\u201d Fleming informed her.</p><p>India\u2019s exhaustion fell away. That meant she and Thorn would dine alone, without a chaperone. Adelaide\u2019s conclusion that the two of them needed no chaperoning was erroneous, but India had not objected.</p><p>Beginning tomorrow, there would be no more kissing\u2014or, for that matter, weeping\u2014in Thorn\u2019s arms. Once Lala entered the house, India would revert to being merely a family friend.</p><p>But for tonight . . . a prickling excitement rushed over her. Thinking about the moment when Thorn had caught her up and taken her mouth without even asking sent a wash of heat down her legs.</p><p>Neither of them was betrothed. Yet. Tonight, no matter how improper, they could still kiss. She started up the stairs with unbecoming haste and forced herself to slow down. When Marie arrived, she requested a bath. She stayed in the bath a good ten minutes longer than she wished, because the only thing she really wanted was to rush downstairs and find Thorn.</p><p>To talk to him.</p><p>Or, perhaps, not to talk.</p><p>By all rights, she should wear a simple gown to supper and save her more seductive clothing for the arrival of Lord Brody. But instead, she put on her most becoming gown. It was the color of the pearly inside of a seashell, with a low drawstring bodice and a light overskirt of loosely woven linen that pulled away in front.</p><p>She felt naughty in it. Not prudish or old-maidish.</p><p>Marie helped her put on a pair of slippers whose heels would put her head just at Thorn\u2019s shoulder. At last India descended, telling herself that she would allow a single kiss. Or maybe two kisses. But no more.</p><p>Fleming stood at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d he said, bowing. \u201cMr. Dautry is waiting for you just outside.\u201d He pushed the front door open for her.</p><p>Of course. They would eat in the dower house with Rose. There would be no kisses. It was silly that India felt such a crushing sense of disappointment.</p><p>Thorn was leaning against the stone lion at the edge of the drive, waiting for her. \u201cRose is surrounded by paper dolls,\u201d he said once she joined him. \u201cI have been informed that my presence is neither required nor particularly desired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we would dine with her,\u201d India said.</p><p>He took her arm, and they began walking not toward the dower house but in the other direction altogether, away from the house and down the hill. \u201cClara has a dab hand with a pair of scissors, and Rose is happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that perhaps in all your frenzied attention to Starberry Court you missed the fishing hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not care for fishing,\u201d India said, \u201cparticularly not when I\u2019m wearing one of my favorite gowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shan\u2019t actually fish,\u201d Thorn said, looking surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t even own a pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is most improper,\u201d India added.</p><p>\u201cI thought we put that nonsense away, at least between ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The house is full of servants now. We could truly be compromised if anyone saw us by ourselves at dusk.\u201d</p><p>He kept walking, drawing her forward. \u201cWho would see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of the servants\u2014and gossip of that nature would spread like fire through London. My reputation would be ruined. In fact, we must return to the house immediately.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorn just grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I would tell Vander that nothing happened between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d she said, trying to explain in a way he would understand. \u201cMy life\u2014any lady\u2019s life\u2014is made up of morning calls, and musicales, and balls. I would be thrown out of society. No one would receive me or send invitations. That\u2019s what it means to be ruined.\u201d</p><p>They reached the bottom of the hill. \u201cThe life you describe sounds damned tedious. I can\u2019t picture you just going to balls and making calls, India.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cI have trouble imagining it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I should ruin you just so you don\u2019t get caught in such a boring life. It would be my good deed for the year.\u201d He pulled her around and his mouth was on hers\u2014not coaxing, as when they\u2019d first kissed, but hot and demanding. This time his mouth was a burning command, a direct order that she relinquish all control.</p><p>India opened her mouth to him without hesitation, aware that her body had been longing for his taste and his touch, aware that she instantly started shaking, just a little. Aware that her arms wrapped around his neck as if she were drowning and only he could save her.</p><p>When he pulled her even tighter, she cried out, the sound muffled by his mouth. His leg pushed forward, between hers, and she ground against him, electrified.</p><p>There was a rough groan and a curse, and Thorn snatched her up, took one long stride, and released her. India shrieked and fell, landing not on the hard ground but on a stretch of canvas suspended in midair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hammock,\u201d he said, laughing down at her. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been in a hammock?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the ropes that held the canvas above the ground. \u201cNo! We can\u2019t do this. I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Thorn lay down beside her in a practiced gesture that revealed he\u2019d spent night after night in hammocks.</p><p>\u201cIs this what mudlarks sleep in?\u201d she whispered, hardly able to shape the words because of the searing heat of his body settling against hers.</p><p>He shook his head, dusted her mouth with his. \u201cWe slept on the ground between graves, in the churchyard. Nice and quiet there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you in a hammock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAboard ship,\u201d he said. \u201cI made one voyage with the East India Company.\u201d</p><p>She meant to ask something else, but his hand had cupped her head, just enough to turn it to his mouth. And after she fell into the potency and storm of his kiss, that hand moved. . . .</p><p>It trailed along her throat, a caress that seemed almost innocent. India squirmed closer to him, her arms pulling him on top of her, parts of her hungry in a way she\u2019d never imagined.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t think about it, because their kiss was wet and hot, and so fierce that her head tilted back and the hammock enveloped them and pushed their bodies together, as close as the satyr and his lover.</p><p>Thorn\u2019s hand drifted below her neck, and a sound broke from India\u2019s throat as his touch rounded the curve of her breast. She tore her mouth from his, an involuntary cry floating into the air.</p><p>He muttered a curse and his mouth covered hers, just as his thumb rubbed across her nipple, sending a streak of golden fire through her. India\u2019s cry was swallowed by his kiss. Not that she consciously realized it, because she could only think about his hard, warm body pushing against hers as she arched shamelessly toward him.</p><p>When Thorn gave her breast another rough caress, India\u2019s heart stopped beating for a moment. When it started again, it was racing. She bent one of her knees and pushed it between his thighs, and this time the groan was his.</p><p>\u201cI want . . .\u201d she whispered, breaking off. But the raw words came from her throat, willy-nilly. \u201cYou and I.\u201d</p><p>He was tugging gently at her bodice, which gave way instantly. He lowered his head again and kissed her collarbone. India felt a shiver rock her entire being as she waited for his lips to drift lower.</p> <p>\u201cYou and me,\u201d she corrected herself, letting her fingers slide through his hair, thick and soft and far too long for a gentleman. She loved that he wasn\u2019t a gentleman. No gentleman would topple her into an open-air ship-bed, kissing her so intimately where anyone might see them.</p><p>Her fingers trailed down his neck, drifting out to caress his shoulders. Thorn let out a husky groan at her touch. The only other sounds were the sleepy grumble of the river and the songs of nesting birds.</p><p>No one would know. No one would hear. She tried to pull his head down to kiss him again, but he pushed up on one arm, steady in the hammock even as it rocked.</p><p>\u201cThere is no you and me,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s you and me in this hammock,\u201d she returned. And she moved her leg to touch that hot, vital part of him. At her touch, she saw darkness in his eyes, like the madness in her blood. \u201cPlease, Thorn. Please.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer and said against her lips, \u201cWhat are you asking for, India?\u201d</p><p>The hammock was swaying, and with it, his body against hers. The muscles in his shoulder rolled under her fingertips, the fine linen of his shirt sliding over his skin.</p><p>His lips opened against hers, and again his hand rounded her breast and put delicious pressure on her nipple. India clung to him, her belly strangely hot, her legs trembling.</p><p>She liked the feeling.</p><p>Very much.</p><p>When Thorn raised his head again, she saw a flare of wildness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want all of it,\u201d she said, and gasped, because his fingers were skimming her side, the intimacy of that touch undeniable. \u201cYou and me.\u201d She blinked. \u201cI mean, you and I.\u201d</p><p>Thorn had pulled aside her bodice again, his mouth descending to her breast. She arched her back and moaned. \u201cI need. . . . Oh Thorn, I need . . .\u201d</p><p>He moved to the other breast, and she lost control of whatever it was she had meant to say. One of his hands was sweeping up one of her legs, leaving raw hunger in its wake. The fever swept over her again: she wanted his taste, his smell, his consuming, ravishing kiss.</p><p>A foggy thought occurred to her: if she was going to play the trollop, she might as well do that. She let her leg fall open, inviting his caress.</p><p>Thorn\u2019s teeth grazed her nipple and at the same moment his fingers curved inward. She was writhing against him, words flowing out of her mouth, an endless stream of pleas that would have embarrassed her except . . .</p><p>They didn\u2019t.</p><p>It felt right. Like a natural thing, like the right thing. \u201cI know you\u2019re a gentleman under the skin, for all you say to the contrary.\u201d The words caught in her throat. \u201cBut I\u2019m asking you, Thorn. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you asking me for?\u201d</p><p>He was looking down at her seriously, as if one hand wasn\u2019t resting on the soft skin of her inner thigh. Her body was frozen, waiting for those fingers to inch higher.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman would stop now,\u201d she said, daring him.</p><p>His fingers drifted another inch, stopped again. The feeling raged through her, and she trembled from head to foot.</p><p>\u201cA man who didn\u2019t care about society would continue, because the woman in his arms was\u2014was agreeable,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>A dusky chuckle drifted into the air. \u201c \u2018Agreeable\u2019?\u201d</p><p>His fingers drifted again, and the air whooshed from her lungs. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, her voice a thread of sound. She hated whispering. She just couldn\u2019t seem to find the breath to make a forceful demand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe sure of what you ask for,\u201d Thorn said, his voice dark. \u201cIf you continue to beg me, India, I will seduce you, and I won\u2019t be sorry. But I won\u2019t marry you simply because my cock has been inside you.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s heart quickened at his words, although she should have been outraged that anyone would say such a vulgar thing to her. But she wasn\u2019t outraged. She was exhilarated.</p><p>\u201cI do not want to marry you,\u201d she said, being as clear as she could. She had managed to tug his shirt free, and the warm, sleek skin of his back was under her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t even like you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he muttered against her lips. \u201cBut I have as good as committed myself to marry another.\u201d</p> <p>India was tired of talking about marriage, or indeed of talking at all. She wiggled down, which made the hammock sway, just enough so that her face was under his. \u201cI want to do all the things in that book.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked, even though his eyes were hungry. \u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>She thought about it for a second, and nodded. \u201cExcept the one with two women. I\u2019m not interested in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, but she saw laughter in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou taught me how to kiss, and that didn\u2019t make me want to marry you. Now you can teach me this,\u201d she said, feeling as if she were about to jump out of her skin. \u201cIf you won\u2019t, just tell me, because\u2014\u201d</p> <p>The fierce look he gave her made the words catch in her throat. \u201cBecause what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll find another man who\u2019s not a gentleman,\u201d India said, not letting him intimidate her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d find another man,\u201d he said, slowly and ominously.</p><p>Though he looked as if he were about to pounce on her, India didn\u2019t flinch. Thorn liked to boast that he wasn\u2019t a gentleman, but he was about to behave like one. He was going to refuse her. He wouldn\u2019t take a lady\u2019s dearest possession, her virtue.</p><p>She slid her palms up his back, under his shirt, and announced, \u201cI am not a virgin.\u201d She was whispering again, but really, how could a woman say such an outrageous thing, other than in a whisper?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t accustomed to lying, and it was surprisingly difficult to lie to Thorn.</p> <p>He stared down at her silently for a few long minutes, and at last said, \u201cDo I have to find some scoundrel and kill him for taking you without your permission?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Something imperceptible changed in the air around them. He shifted his weight, just slightly, but it was so delicious that a shudder coursed through her.</p><p>\u201cI will not do this in a hammock,\u201d he stated. His mouth drifted across her cheekbone and she felt the heated touch of his tongue.</p><p>She said, with a little gasp, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever, we can begin in the hammock,\u201d he said, his voice like a purr. And with that, his hand swept up her leg and didn\u2019t stop. Didn\u2019t dandle and caress, or trace patterns on her inner thigh. Instead, it went straight to her sweetest spot, which had in truth never been touched by anyone but herself.</p><p>Now his fingers slid into her softness, plundering her without asking permission, taking what they wanted. Fire rushed up her body as he unerringly pressed down in just the right spot. India opened her mouth to scream, but he put his lips over hers. With the kiss, and what he was doing with his hands . . . she squirmed under him, breathless, unable to keep her legs from moving. Her fingers tightened on his back, thinking dimly that she wanted his weight, that feeling, the way it was when he\u2014</p><p>One of his broad fingers sank into her and she tore her mouth from his because she was on fire and the sounds in her throat had to come out. . . .</p><p>And she came. Like that. In a hammock. The orgasms she gave herself were nothing to this one, not with Thorn beside her, one muscled leg pinning her down, the hammock swaying, his fingers . . . his tongue in her mouth.</p> <p>\u201cThorn,\u201d she gasped, not knowing what she wanted to say. \u201cThorn!\u201d</p><p>His fingers slipped away and the hammock lurched. Then all his delicious weight was on top of her, elbows on the sides of her face, and he was kissing her with a fierce, consuming hunger that turned her nerves to fire. She had just come, and already she was shaking, her heart pounding, her hands flying over him. Instinctively she pushed up against his heat and strength.</p><p>He tore his mouth away, but India was beside herself, her breath coming in little sobs. Thorn wound a hand in her hair and pulled her head toward him. His lips brushed hers, the hammock swayed, and his body ground against hers. A desperate sound broke from her throat and drifted into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou will not be able to be quiet, will you?\u201d Thorn asked, his eyes smoldering. \u201cYou will never be silent.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t know how to reply. Her mind was clouded, absorbed by the chiseled contour of his mouth. She arched toward him again and licked his lower lip.</p><p>His eyelids dipped, and he answered his own question. \u201cNever. You\u2019re in it with your entire being, aren\u2019t you, India? All of you.\u201d</p><p>India was certain of only one thing: she was completely uninterested in a comparison of herself to other women. She felt at once satisfied and unfinished, replete and hungry. \u201cI can be silent,\u201d she said with a gasp.</p><p>A half smile curled his lips. He tilted his hips. The hammock rolled and his weight pressed between her legs. A moan slipped from her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d he said, whispering it against her throat as he nipped and kissed her. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many women like you, India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d she cried, exasperated. \u201cAre we to make love in this hammock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her heart plummeted into her slippers, and her hand slid from his back. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall make love in my bed,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIn that red bedroom you made for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make love to you in that bed!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, and she felt the quake of it against her skin. \u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking love in your bedchamber would be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong how?\u201d It was miraculous, the way he could maneuver in the hammock without making it turn over and dump the two of them on the lawn. He pulled away her bodice again and the pale cream of her breast fell into his hand, overflowing his palm. She couldn\u2019t see what he was doing because his hair fell forward.</p><p>But she could feel.</p><p>What she felt made her start to pant even as she tried to explain. \u201cYour bedchamber is for your wife. For a man and his wife. We\u2019re not that, and this is just one night, so . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off when she forgot what she was saying.</p><p>Thorn raised his head and swiped a thumb across her nipple. She squeaked. \u201cI can\u2019t make love to you outdoors, India. That means my room.\u201d He rolled fluidly from the hammock and pulled her straight into his arms. Just like that, they were both standing.</p><p>\u201cNot in the house,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I just said, the house . . . the bedchamber is for you and your wife,\u201d she tried again, stumbling into words as she tried to read his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll make memories there, and I don\u2019t want any of those memories to be\u2014\u201d She broke off awkwardly.</p><p>He gave her that ironic half smile of his. \u201cLady Xenobia India St. Clair, are you telling me that I\u2019m not allowed to bring a mistress to Starberry Court?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am telling you precisely that.\u201d She folded her arms over her chest. \u201cI made a home for you. You mustn\u2019t sully it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Sully it\u2019?\u201d</p><p>India was starting to feel distinctly querulous, as well as faintly ridiculous. Had she really allowed a man to put his hands between her legs . . . in the open air? It seemed that she had. The excuse of \u201can error in judgment\u201d didn\u2019t quite cover that foolishness.</p><p>She shook out her skirts, wondering if her hairpins were all lost. \u201cI think we should\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Her words stopped in a little squeak, because suddenly she was over Thorn\u2019s shoulder and he was striding back up the hill. \u201cPut me down!\u201d she insisted. \u201cThorn!\u201d</p><p>He just laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be at the gatehouse in a moment. And by the way, I\u2019m not a man to ever keep a mistress after I\u2019m married. And I should also tell you that I have never made love without a French letter: you will face no danger of an unwanted child from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gatehouse?\u201d One of his hands was holding her bottom, cupping it tightly, and it felt . . . She began wiggling. \u201cYou must let me down. This is absurd!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly light, considering your curves,\u201d he said cheerfully, and that hand curled a bit tighter.</p><p>India pushed herself away from his back. \u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m fat? Let me down!\u201d</p> <p>His long strides had taken them from the grass onto the gravel path leading to the gatehouse. \u201cThorn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to investigate more closely to know whether you\u2019re carrying extra weight,\u201d he said, his tone silky smooth.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly will not!\u201d India wrenched herself up at precisely the moment that he swung her to her feet, so she lurched backward and fell against the door of the gatehouse. She looked up at Thorn, prepared to blister his ears as he had never been scolded before.</p><p>But he was looking down at her, and her words evaporated.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he stated. \u201cI shall have you, Lady Xenobia India. We\u2019re not contemplating marriage, because you will marry better than I, and I am all but promised to another. But we shall give each other pleasure tonight. Have you any clarifications to add?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, unable to move her eyes from his face. Everything she did, all her adult life, had been regulated and disciplined, and directed toward the best possible marriage.</p> <p>This had nothing to do with marriage.</p><p>This was for her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know, I\u2019ve never made love to a woman I trusted,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand a contract,\u201d he said, reaching behind her to push open the door. \u201cYou are not trying to entrap me, because I know damn well that you\u2019re wet between the legs thinking about me, not my money.\u201d</p><p>He made her sound like a loose woman. Which, it seemed, she was.</p><p>Or rather, she would be as soon as she did this, because ladies did not make love to men to whom they weren\u2019t married.</p><p>Ever.</p> <p>She watched as he pushed open the shutters to let in the fading sunlight. He turned to look at her, and she was surprised by the ferocity in his eyes. \u201cI will ask once more if someone took your virtue by force, India.\u201d His voice had gone low and ominous again. He was ready to fight\u2014no, to squash\u2014every man who had offered her insult.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, giving him that new smile that existed only for him.</p><p>He said something she didn\u2019t hear, and then she was in his arms and they were kissing again, so frantically that she couldn\u2019t breathe. His shirt was already out of his breeches, and she slid her hands around his waist. He pulled back and threw the shirt over his head.</p><p>He was magnificent, bunched muscle narrowing to a waist without an inch of extra flesh on it. Not at all like her body. She frowned and reached out, tracing a white slash across his abdomen with her finger.</p><p>\u201cMy body\u2019s covered with scars,\u201d he said, glancing down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d India said softly, bending to put a kiss where her finger had been. Then she straightened, turned, and climbed the narrow stairs to the bedchamber that she\u2019d furnished for a gatekeeper, should Thorn ever hire one. The room held little more than a bed big enough for a man and his wife.</p><p>She had pushed open one shutter when a pair of hands slid around her waist and Thorn\u2019s body came hard and warm against her back. \u201cMay I unbutton your gown?\u201d His lips were on her neck, and she leaned back against him and reveled in a feeling of being outside herself.</p><p>She didn\u2019t feel like Lady Xenobia, daughter of a marquess. At this moment, she was just India, just herself, making love to someone who had no expectations of her other than her own pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her voice so husky that she cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cYes, you may.\u201d</p><p>The shell-pink gown fell to her feet, followed by her corset. India turned about slowly, aware that her chemise was transparent. Compared to many fashionable women, she was generously shaped. When one grows up hungry . . . well, she liked to eat, and she made no apologies for that. And even though she sometimes thought she had too many curves, she didn\u2019t care enough to go hungry again.</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d Thorn growled.</p><p>India felt a smile form on her face without her volition. Her shape might not suit current fashion, but Thorn obviously appreciated it. She reached down, just as he had done with his shirt, pulled her chemise over her head, and tossed it aside.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Thorn took one look at India, who stood before him wearing no more than a pair of silk stockings tied just below her plump thighs, and knew that the control on which he had prided himself since he bedded his first woman was about to break. He wouldn\u2019t be able to make love to India by hovering over her on rigid arms, analyzing the way her head turned, or the sounds that came from her mouth.</p><p>He was going to lose control and feast on her body. She had gorgeous breasts, a slightly rounded belly, lush hips, and legs that didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>The curse that came from his mouth was heartfelt. It wasn\u2019t just her body. It was the way she was looking at him, slightly amused, confident, with desire in her eyes. Her long hair was tousled and fell around her shoulders and over one breast. She looked like a dream, like Venus herself come to earth.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you smell so good?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy perfume is scented with moonflower. Aren\u2019t you going to remove your breeches?\u201d Her voice rolled over his skin like heated honey.</p><p>Her lips were dark cherries, swollen from his kisses. He wanted to push her onto her knees and beg her to take him in her mouth. Thank God she wasn\u2019t a virgin. No virgin ever looked at a man as she looked at him now, as if she could lap him up.</p><p>He had to pull himself together. \u201cI suspect you don\u2019t need me to tell you how beautiful you are?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved, and the only thoughts in his mind were outrageous. He reached down and pulled off his boots.</p><p>\u201cA woman can never hear that too often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are damned incredible,\u201d he said bluntly, wrenching down his breeches and drawers in one movement, keeping his eyes on her.</p><p>She seemed entirely at ease. The thought that she must have stood like this before more than one man flitted through his mind, but he brushed it away.</p><p>Her eyes drifted down his naked body and caught at his groin. Her tongue touched her bottom lip, and he nearly groaned aloud at the sight of that pink tip, his cock sending a wild pulse of lust through him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you really want to try everything Feather did with his various inamoratas?\u201d he asked, forcing his mouth to form words.</p><p>Her eyes came back to his face slowly, heavy-lidded but not sleepy. She let a smile answer him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start here.\u201d He took a step forward and they were skin to skin, a second later tumbling on the bed. He bent one knee so he didn\u2019t crush her with his weight, and then he was touching her everywhere, his mouth following his hands.</p><p>Her breasts: making her cry out.</p> <p>Her belly: making her pant.</p><p>Lower still: making her moan.</p><p>A second later he was kissing her in her sweetest private place. He nudged her legs aside, took one more look at her eyes, hazy with desire, bent his head, and tasted her, making her scream.</p><p>Ordinarily, he would have been analyzing what every touch did to her. But this time it was as if he was doing it for himself. Her taste was like a drug setting his body on fire. His fingers curled into her hips so hard that he\u2019d leave bruises, he gave her one last caress, and she exploded. Again.</p><p>Generally, Thorn entered a woman with due attention to her state of readiness and her state of mind. He was respectful.</p> <p>But now he was driven by a need and hunger that knew nothing of respect. He pulled on a sheath, his hands rough and urgent. Rearing up, he pushed India\u2019s legs farther apart, bent her knees, and thrust into her in one long stroke. She was hot and tight, and wet. His mind went blank for a moment, his entire being focused between his legs.</p><p>He came to himself for a fleeting moment of sanity and looked down. India seemed . . . stupefied. But not with pain, thank God. Some women found him uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou must be as large as Feather,\u201d she said, her voice husky with unmistakable pleasure.</p><p>He drew back, watching her face, thrust again . . . she arched her head back and actually shrieked. And before he had done more than thrust home one more time, he felt her tightening around him, her body shaking, little pants coming from her mouth.</p><p>He looked down and caught sight of the two of them. Connected. All her dainty, duchesslike pinkness and the tool of a rough bastard like himself. It was hardly possible, but he thickened even more.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, India,\u201d he whispered, leaning down to kiss her carefully, with reverence. Her mouth opened under his, hot and wet and urgent, and he completely lost his mind. He didn\u2019t brace himself on his elbows, the better to assess his bed partner. He didn\u2019t listen for the catch in her breath or watch for a tremble that might reveal she was close to finding pleasure yet again.</p> <p>He did none of that. The horse had broken its lead line and was away. His mind spun to white, his senses narrowed to the soft perfection of her, the lush beauty of her breast in his hand, the way her body clasped his.</p><p>He began going faster and harder than he remembered ever going. She was clutching him, her legs curved around him, her arms around his neck. His hands were on her hips, holding her still as he thrust into her, grunting because the pleasure of it was so acute that it was like pain burning up the back of his thighs, deep in his balls.</p><p>But he held on, managed to hold on by some thread of control until . . . she threw back her hair and a cloud of white-blond silk flew about her shoulders. He heard her cry as if it were a command. His hips jerked with a force he\u2019d never felt before, emptying him into her, thrust after thrust.</p><p>Until he had no more to give.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The following morning</p><p>India rarely hesitated when it came to dressing. Her wardrobe was organized, mentally if not physically, into categories that corresponded to their purpose, whether that was to cow a bumptious butler or soothe a nervous lady.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t any gowns that would simultaneously usher in a betrothal (the dark violet muslin with buttons?) and flirt with a potential husband (the rose-colored muslin with a low bodice?). Frankly, all her bodices felt precariously low. In the last two years, waistlines had crept ever upward and necklines downward\u2014and India was well endowed. Very well endowed. Lately fashion had become annoying, and something she\u2019d prefer to put out of her mind.</p> <p>At length she made up her mind. \u201cI\u2019ll wear the sprigged muslin with the embroidered roses this morning,\u201d she told her maid. \u201cAnd tonight, the French silk.\u201d</p><p>Marie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cFinally, you will wear the French silk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith amethysts in my hair,\u201d India said, remembering that she had to appear a proper candidate to become a duchess.</p><p>Marie handed her a jar of lotion, and India began swiftly rubbing it into her legs. She felt different, as if she\u2019d paid a visit to a foreign country and come home speaking a new language.</p><p>She and Thorn had lingered in the gatehouse until she\u2019d had to go home or risk exposure. They\u2019d been lucky, because she\u2019d darted in a side door and made her way to her bedchamber without being seen. Marie had been surprised to find her already tucked into her bed, but she made the excuse that she\u2019d been exhausted.</p><p>And frankly, she had been. After hours in Thorn\u2019s arms, she had felt as limp as a piece of velvet; she\u2019d slept with a dreamless intensity that she hadn\u2019t experienced since she was young.</p><p>But now it was all different. Whatever she and Thorn had had between them was over. Lala and her mother were due later that afternoon, as was Lord Brody. The Duke and Duchess of Villiers would arrive, and the last thing she wanted was for Eleanor to think that she was a hussy who would roll about with Thorn in the open air.</p><p>That was a private memory. She knew that she would never again have such a wonderful night. That was it.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Thorn had used sheaths every time, and he never suspected that she was, in fact, inexperienced. So there would be no consequences, other than the gift of an utterly delightful, sensual memory that she could tuck away and examine later in life.</p><p>She\u2019d had a lover. Most women gained a husband, at some point or another. But few, in her opinion, had a lover. The thought made her smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you happy,\u201d Marie said, as India handed her back the jar of lotion. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you work so hard,\u201d her maid continued. \u201cBut Starberry Court is just perfect. Everyone says so, from the bootblack to Mr. Fleming himself. It\u2019s exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Marie,\u201d India said, feeling a bit guilty because she was happy for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>She had to stop thinking about the gatehouse. Last night was like a fairy tale, like something that happened to a stranger, not to herself. Though every time she sat down she had to suppress a wince. Clearly it had happened to her.</p><p>Thinking about Thorn made her nipples harden, and her belly take on a liquid, hot feeling. That was what loose women, who made love not for coin but for pleasure, presumably felt all the time. The women in Feather\u2019s book.</p><p>She had a lot of newfound sympathy for them. This was like being hungry: it felt urgent. She wanted to find Thorn and pull him into a spare bedchamber and demand that he ravish her. No. That was over.</p><p>From now on, she would be virtuous. As soon as the house party had concluded, she would return to London and make a decision between her various suitors.</p><p>Unless, of course, Lord Brody was as charming as Thorn seemed to think he was. In that case, she might choose to be a duchess.</p><p>An entirely virtuous duchess, of course.</p><p>After India was dressed, she tried to look at herself as critically as possible. She was going to conduct a courtship under Thorn\u2019s eyes. She knew he would watch her and Lord Brody. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t think her clothing was feminine enough. Not sensual enough, with all his talk of generals and the like. A deeply feminine part of her wanted to prove him wrong. The bodice of her muslin gown was pleated and caught up just under her breasts, and constructed in such a way that every pleat made a statement about her best assets. She wore slippers made in Italy with pointed toes and slender heels. And she carried a blue reticule sewn with metallic threads.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should wear some lip salve?\u201d she asked Marie.</p><p>He maid looked up, startled. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? You are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Marie genuinely believed that every man in the vicinity would fall in love with her mistress. India opened up one pot of salve after another, until she found her favorite shade of peony pink.</p><p>\u201cI see no need for lip salve in the morning,\u201d Marie stated.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t understand was that most men wanted a woman like Lala: a woman who didn\u2019t say much\u2014and what she said was uttered in a whisper.</p><p>India never whispered. She considered whispering girlish. The truth was that she was more likely to yell, at least around Thorn.</p> <p>Plus, she had a straight nose, instead of an adorable little tip-tilted one. Her hair was too thick and wouldn\u2019t stay up properly. And her lips were too big, though she had the idea that applying pale pink color helped with that problem.</p><p>She knew they were too big because she\u2019d been called \u201cfish-lips,\u201d back when she was a child trading mushrooms at Mr. Sweatham\u2019s shop. She would bring him a box of mushrooms from the forest, and he would give her flour and bacon in trade. He always gave her more than the mushrooms were worth, but her pride was never as big as her stomach was empty.</p><p>She could still hear that derisive hiss in Sweatham\u2019s son\u2019s voice when he would say, \u201cThere\u2019s Lady Fish-lips!\u201d or even worse, \u201cCharity Fish-lips!\u201d</p><p>The memory was a steadying influence. Her immediate goal was to see Lala betrothed to Thorn.</p><p>After that, she would find just the right husband.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p> <p>By the time the carriage drove up to Starberry Court, Lala was ready to throw herself in front of the horses. Her mother had been suffering from heart palpitations for three days, until she had declared the previous day that she simply could not make the trip to Starberry Court.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Lala\u2019s father said that he could no longer afford to feed his family that Lady Rainsford gave in. His lordship was probably exaggerating, but he made his point.</p><p>Today her mother spent the entire trip from London pointing out that if Lala ate less, her father wouldn\u2019t be so concerned about feeding the family. Never mind the fact that Lady Rainsford couldn\u2019t seem to stop buying bonnets and shoes and even new gowns. And it was the mistress of the house who insisted they have three courses at every meal, as in other fashionable households. And it was Lady Rainsford who retained a doctor to visit the house every single day, the better to listen to her heart.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe that Dr. Belview refused, utterly refused, to accompany us,\u201d she said fretfully as the carriage turned down a long drive that Lala thought must lead to Starberry Court. \u201cHe is appalling disloyal! I am strongly considering reminding him of his Hippocritical Oath or whatever that is called.\u201d</p><p>Lala sat next to the window, biting her tongue. The line of trees opened up, and Starberry Court came into view. She gasped.</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t notice, since she was busy patting her forehead with an infusion of lavender, which someone had told her was efficacious for headaches.</p><p>The house was huge, with imposing wings stretching to the left and right. Two carriages were drawn up on the gravel circle, and a number of footmen milled about in front of the door.</p><p>Panic gripped Lala. She could not do this. She simply could not do this. This was not the simple country house she had expected from Mr. Dautry, who didn\u2019t always wear a waistcoat when he walked in the park.</p> <p>This really was the estate of an earl or a duke. The mistress of this house . . . The mistress of this house would need to be not merely smart, but brilliant. Accomplished. She would have to be able to read.</p><p>Her mother finally glanced out the window. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bandage,\u201d she said, making even less sense than usual.</p><p>Their carriage was slowing.</p><p>\u201cA bandage covering a suppurating wound, the wound of bastardy,\u201d Lady Rainsford clarified.</p><p>Lala\u2019s heart sank. \u201cMama, Mr. Dautry is a perfectly respectable businessman. It is not his fault that the duke was not married to his mother. You mustn\u2019t speak in this way before him.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rainsford straightened. \u201cYour father threatened me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe threatened me. He said that if you don\u2019t marry the bastard, he will not pay for another season.\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cEven though it goes against every part of my nature, I will abandon my daughter to . . . to the filthy lucre of ill-gotten gains.\u201d Her hands were pulling at her lace handkerchief again.</p><p>Lala\u2019s hands itched to slap her parent. The impulse was so wrong that she hardly knew what to do with it. \u201cMama,\u201d she said, taking a deep breath, \u201cI beg you to calm yourself.\u201d</p><p>The carriage had stopped now, and any second their groom would open the door. He would find her mother with a wild tinge to her eyes, pulling, pulling at her handkerchief. Lala dropped onto her knees on the carriage floor, her hands over her mother\u2019s restless ones. \u201cMama, you want me to be happy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That got her attention. \u201cOf course I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to marry someone and not have to go through another season,\u201d Lala said, whispering it. \u201cI truly do, Mama.\u201d</p><p>In the nick of time, sanity poured back into Lady Rainsford\u2019s eyes, and Lala awkwardly retook her seat just as the door opened.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you shall have him, dearest,\u201d her mother said, sounding almost like a normal woman.</p><p>Lala swallowed hard and climbed down from the carriage. Whoever had traveled in the other two carriages had already been escorted into the house. The butler approached and introduced himself, bowing as they shook out their skirts. Lala liked him immediately, just from the way he took their measure with a practiced glance and at once paid her mother lavish attention.</p><p>By the time they entered the house, her mother was confiding all the details of her palpitations, and Fleming was reassuring her that the village doctor would be more than happy to pay a call every day.</p><p>\u201cHe is not an untried practitioner,\u201d he was saying now, as a footman took their pelisses. \u201cDr. Hatfield is well known and respected in these parts, but also in London. One of the youngest members of the Royal College of Physicians, as I understand it. I\u2019ll take the precaution of sending a message asking him to pay you a visit this afternoon, Lady Rainsford, so that we can make absolutely certain that the arduous nature of the carriage ride caused no problems.\u201d</p><p>Lala felt as if a ten-stone weight had lifted from the back of her neck. Fleming opened the drawing room door and ushered in her mother as tenderly as if she were a day-old chick. It was a measure of what a bad daughter Lala was that the only thing going through her mind, other than gratitude, was a bleak guess that if she married Dautry, her mother would probably move to this house in order to bask daily in Fleming\u2019s gentle ministrations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At which point Lala would move to Dautry\u2019s London house, and everyone would be happy, she thought, pushing away a wave of panic.</p><p>She saw Mr. Dautry the moment they entered the room. He was taller than everyone else, and remarkably male, which gave her a sensation that verged on dislike. Why couldn\u2019t he have been a mild fellow, only a little taller than herself?</p><p>Her feeling of dread grew when she glimpsed Mr. Dautry\u2019s father, the man who might be her father-in-law someday. The duke was wearing a coat of patterned dark green, which was not extraordinary in itself except for the fact that it was lined in a misty purple silk that showed in the coattails and where his cuffs turned back.</p><p>She wanted to run from the room, but he was strolling toward her, followed by the duchess, and there was nowhere to hide. Lady Xenobia started to her feet as well, stooping to help Lady Adelaide.</p> <p>Confronted by the entire party, Lala dropped into a curtsy before the duke, so deep that she almost turned her ankle, then straightened just enough to turn slightly and curtsy again before the duchess, who wore the most beautiful morning dress that Lala had ever seen. It was made of white chambray, with an overdress of pale yellow silk closely fitted across the shoulders and bosom. Her Grace certainly didn\u2019t look like a woman who had an eight-year-old child. Her figure was exquisite.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t make herself meet Mr. Dautry\u2019s eyes, after she curtsied to him. Lady Xenobia was there too, so Lala just kept curtsying until she nearly curtsied to her own mother by mistake.</p><p>As they all exchanged greetings, panic started boiling up inside her, bubbling like molten chocolate in a pot. She didn\u2019t want a father-in-law like this, one whose cold, gray eyes looked her over and obviously found her wanting.</p><p>He would be able to deduce that she couldn\u2019t read. She knew it.</p><p>But he was standing just before her, while her mother informed the rest of the company about the horrors of their journey. So Lala took a deep breath and said, \u201cI trust you had a pleasant journey, Your Grace?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect this will seem odd to you, Miss Rainsford, but when one is the parent of an extremely active eight-year-old boy, nearly every carriage ride that does not include him is a joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lala said. She could think of nothing else to say. \u201cWhere is the boy at the moment?\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>\u201cEton.\u201d</p><p>In the dreadful silence that followed, Lala remembered her plan. \u201cIsn\u2019t it awful about Napoleon taking Venice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwful is one word for it, Miss Rainsford. I was more interested to read in the Morning Post that in a mere three years the Doge had allowed the Venetian fleet to dwindle to three hundred and nine vessels. No wonder Napoleon\u2019s fleet took the city. Did you read that particular article?\u201d</p><p>Lala gulped. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t take the Morning Post on a regular basis,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother is quite fond of Bell\u2019s Weekly Messenger.\u201d</p> <p>The duke bowed his head, and another silence ensued. Then he said, \u201cMy wife is an inveterate reader of novels; there are evenings when I can scarcely persuade her to retire to bed, as she is deep in a romantic tale.\u201d</p><p>Lala opened her mouth to say . . . to say what? \u201cI can\u2019t read?\u201d \u201cI never read?\u201d</p><p>Luckily Lady Xenobia turned from the cluster of people surrounding Lala\u2019s mother and cried, \u201cYour Grace, please tell me that you are not castigating your wife for an innocent enjoyment of novels! I told you last month that if you would merely embark on the first chapter of Sicilian Romance, you would soon find yourself trembling in the middle of the night, unable to stop turning the pages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am trembling in the night, it has nothing to do with literature,\u201d the duke said, giving Lady Xenobia a teasing smile.</p><p>Lala blinked, but Lady Xenobia quirked up one side of her mouth and said, in a mock severe tone, \u201cThere is nothing worse than a duke who is determined to be clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always think that parents should be seen and not heard,\u201d Mr. Dautry said, looming up at his father\u2019s shoulder as Lady Adelaide took Lala\u2019s mother off to a comfortable seat. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you are telling Miss Rainsford ribald jokes. I shall disown you.\u201d</p><p>His Grace\u2019s cold eyes warmed when he smiled at his son. Father and son were nearly identical, except that the duke\u2019s hair was more generously streaked with white. They had the same large bodies, and the same air of supreme control. As if each knew every muscle in his body and how to use it.</p><p>\u201cA chip off the old duke,\u201d Lady Xenobia said, laughing.</p> <p>Mr. Dautry slung an arm around his father\u2019s shoulders and grinned at her. \u201cSurely you are not implying that I have achieved a level of elegance akin to dear papa\u2019s? You astonish me, Lady Xenobia.\u201d</p><p>Lala felt ill. How could these people be so informal with each other? She\u2019d never seen such behavior, and certainly never imagined it happened in dukes\u2019 families. She wouldn\u2019t dream of putting a hand on her father\u2019s sleeve, let alone embracing him, or addressing him in such a jocular fashion. She had never wanted to be elsewhere more desperately in her life.</p><p>\u201cSurely you are not asking for my opinion of your coat?\u201d Lady Xenobia asked Mr. Dautry. Her eyes were dancing, and Lala had the strong feeling that there was a private jest between them. The duke was looking from one to the other, evidently as unenlightened as she.</p><p>\u201cI always desire the truth from women, especially beautiful ones,\u201d Mr. Dautry said. \u201cThough I should tell you,\u201d he added silkily, \u201cthat I have received little disparagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am always startled by how na\u00efve gentlemen can be,\u201d Lady Xenobia replied. \u201cIn fact, I quite admire your coat, Mr. Dautry. Would it be a creation of Monsieur Devoulier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forced Tobias into his workroom for a fitting at age fourteen,\u201d the duke put in, \u201cand now Devoulier simply sends him coats at regular intervals.\u201d</p><p>Shoulder to shoulder, the duke and his son looked like an illustration in Gentleman\u2019s Magazine of handsome gentlemen wearing the very latest fashions. Lala stood beside them silently, her stomach twisting, listening as best she could for a moment when she might contribute something to the conversation.</p><p>But it was impossible. The subject had changed from men\u2019s haberdashery to a school friend of Mr. Dautry\u2019s, a man named Wilberforce.</p><p>\u201cOh, Wilberforce,\u201d Mr. Dautry said dismissively. \u201cHis bark is bigger than his willy.\u201d</p><p>Lala wasn\u2019t even entirely sure what a \u201cwilly\u201d was.</p><p>Happily, Lady Xenobia said, \u201cOn that less than polite note, I shall now take Miss Rainsford to Lady Adelaide, who is very much looking forward to chatting with her. Try to behave yourself, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing disappointed in the Duke of Villiers\u2019s eyes when he looked at Lady Xenobia. Well, there wouldn\u2019t be, would there? She was brilliant, and there was something luscious about her beauty spot, for all that Lala\u2019s mother insisted it was vulgar.</p><p>Lala dutifully followed Lady Xenobia across the room, consumed by the feeling that this party would be even worse than the season. At balls, one didn\u2019t have to engage in true conversation, because the next dance was always about to begin. She simply smiled prettily at her suitors, while they rattled on about whatever they wanted: willies and Doges, for example. Not dogs, doges. Whatever they were. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had just greeted Lady Adelaide, who was sitting beside Lala\u2019s mother, when the door opened again and that nice butler announced, \u201cLord Brody.\u201d</p><p>The gentleman had tousled hair and piercing blue eyes underlined by dark shadows, which suggested to Lala that he\u2019d stayed up all night. Doing something naughty, no doubt.</p><p>Like Mr. Dautry, he was not the type of man with whom Lala wanted to associate. No matter how striking he was.</p><p>Sure enough, Mr. Dautry went over and pounded him on the back by way of greeting, as men did with their friends. Lord Brody started laughing; he was probably the clever type as well. Mr. Dautry said something in that smoky voice of his, and Lord Brody replied, \u201chorny as a peach-orchard boar,\u201d a comment that she didn\u2019t understand at all.</p> <p>So Lala turned back to Lady Adelaide, her mother, and Lady Xenobia. It was easy to follow their conversation, because her mother never allowed an audience to go to waste. At present she was detailing her palpitations and what the doctor said about them.</p><p>Mr. Dautry\u2019s drawing room was as elegant as that in a royal palace. Lord knows how many servants were employed on the estate: she\u2019d seen several footmen, and one had to assume that any number of maids were about as well.</p><p>As a child, she had dreamed of living in a smallish house with a picket fence and a little kitchen garden. Like every one of her dreams, that had smashed against the rocks. Her mother\u2014notwithstanding her objections to Mr. Dautry\u2019s base birth\u2014was obviously impressed by Starberry Court, and thrilled to be rubbing shoulders with the Duchess of Villiers.</p><p>Lala would have to marry Dautry and live in this perfectly frightful museum of a house, crammed with fancy furniture and servants.</p><p>Dautry was bringing his friend across the room toward them. \u201cLady Rainsford, Lady Xenobia, and Miss Rainsford, may I present an old friend of mine, Lord Brody? Lady Adelaide, I believe you have met this reprobate before.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Brody dropped back and made his leg, bowing to Lady Adelaide, whom he greeted like a favorite aunt. As he bowed to Lala\u2019s mother, she became girlishly vivacious, recounting the time when they met before. \u201cIn fact, you shared a meal with my darling daughter!\u201d she said.</p><p>Lady Xenobia showed no overt signs of being awestruck to meet a future duke, but Lord Brody was obviously intrigued by her. He bent his head to the side, as if he saw something he\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>Lala knew why, too. Lady Xenobia was astonishingly lovely, with more hair than Lala had imagined one woman could have, all of it piled on top of her head. Plus, she\u2019d painted her lips, and with her beauty mark, and the way her upper lip formed a perfect bow . . . She was probably the most sensual woman Lala had ever seen.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s sharp elbow dug into her side. \u201cWhy are you staring at Lady Xenobia?\u201d Lady Rainsford hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re making a fool of yourself!\u201d</p><p>Lala turned hastily back to the conversation about palpitations, only to find that they had moved on to talk of female ailments. Her mother dated all her problems to the birth of her two daughters.</p><p>Mr. Dautry, Lord Brody, and Lady Xenobia were having such a lively conversation that they kept breaking into laughter\u2014even Mr. Dautry, who usually looked as if he never smiled, let alone laughed. After a bit, the duke and duchess joined them and all five stood about being clever, while Lala sat, hiding her bottom in a chair and thinking about how she\u2019d like to plummet through the floor into the wine cellars.</p> <p>\u201cThe blood!\u201d her mother said, fanning herself. \u201cYou would not believe the blood!\u201d</p><p>Lady Adelaide looked queasy; she had no children, and she probably didn\u2019t welcome these details. Lala had heard it all before. She had already decided that if she ever gave birth, she was going to drink a gallon of laudanum and wake up the next morning.</p><p>The door opened again, and the butler entered. Lala began wondering if anyone would notice if she choked due to lack of air and died right there. Probably not. Though her mother might notice, insomuch as it would diminish her audience.</p><p>When Lala looked up again, she discovered, standing directly in front of her, the very embodiment of the man she had always wanted to marry. He wasn\u2019t young, but he wasn\u2019t old either. His eyes were navy blue, with wrinkles at the corners that showed he knew how to smile. He was almost bald, and she could tell with one look that he wouldn\u2019t have a hairy chest. And he wasn\u2019t as imposing as Mr. Dautry. He was probably only a few inches taller than she was.</p><p>The butler was introducing Dr. Hatfield and the doctor was bowing and saying that he would be most happy to treat her mother while she was in residence at Starberry. In fact, if she agreed, he would like to conduct a preliminary consultation now.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes shifted, and Lala could see that she was rethinking the seriousness of her palpitations; after all, she was sitting with Lady Adelaide, while a duke and duchess stood close by.</p><p>\u201cMy mother will not agree to see you, Dr. Hatfield,\u201d Lala said, standing, \u201cbecause she would never put her health in front of the enjoyment of others. But I must insist that you do examine her; she had palpitations all morning in the carriage.\u201d</p><p>Lady Adelaide bounced to her feet as well, likely happy to be released from a discussion of childbirth gore. \u201cOur health is tremendously important after we reach the change of life, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Lala\u2019s mother gave Lady Adelaide a look so disdainful that it could have frozen lemonade. Her ladyship didn\u2019t appear to notice, and somehow all three of them, followed by the doctor, left the room and went up the stairs. Lala wasn\u2019t quite sure why Lady Adelaide was escorting them, but she was grateful for it; her mother was always more restrained in the presence of other ladies.</p><p>Once they were in Lady Rainsford\u2019s bedchamber, Lady Adelaide seated herself to the side while Lala stood by the bed and watched. Dr. Hatfield went through the various motions that she\u2019d seen forty or fifty doctors do in her lifetime. He asked questions, listened to her mother\u2019s chest, and took her pulse.</p><p>Her mother talked on and on. Dr. Hatfield had looked at Lala only once, swiftly, when her mother explained that even though it might lead to a palpitation that could prove the end of her, her maternal desire to see Lala settled in life had led to the enormous step of leaving Dr. Belview\u2019s care for a week.</p><p>Dr. Hatfield had beautiful eyes and a long, lean face that matched his lanky body. He was perfect: masculine without being overly so. Watching, Lala tried desperately to keep her breathing slow and even, because it wasn\u2019t panic she was feeling now. It was something else, something far more pleasurable.</p><p>When the doctor straightened, Lala held her breath. This was the point at which medical practitioners either ruined everything by announcing that Lady Rainsford wasn\u2019t ill at all, or patted her mother\u2019s hand and told her that she needed rest and good care, then charged two pounds and promised to return the next day to collect another payment.</p><p>She wanted him to be the first sort. But she also wanted him to be the second sort.</p><p>He did neither. Instead, he turned to Lala. \u201cMiss Rainsford, what do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cWhat do I think of my mother\u2019s health?\u201d No one had ever asked her that.</p><p>\u201cI find that the most perceptive observers of the ill are family members. A daughter can understand, better than a stranger, her mother\u2019s condition.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow, Lala found her tongue. \u201cMy mother is quite ill,\u201d she said firmly. And that was true. When her mother got that spiraling look in her eyes and her voice rose, no one could doubt that something was genuinely wrong.</p><p>Dr. Hatfield nodded, his eyes grave, and turned back to his patient. \u201cI shall visit you again tomorrow morning, the better to monitor your health, Lady Rainsford. I think you would do best to stay in your chamber and rest for at least two to three days. I\u2019m afraid this visit will be far too taxing for your heart.\u201d</p><p>Lady Adelaide jumped to her feet. \u201cThere is no reason to be concerned, Dr. Hatfield. I will be sure to keep your patient comfortable and happy. My dear Lady Rainsford, you will join the party in a few days, when you are feeling stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t!\u201d Lady Rainsford rarely spent time in bed. There was, Lala thought cynically, no audience in a bedchamber.</p> <p>\u201cYou must think of your health above all else,\u201d Lady Adelaide said firmly. \u201cI shall check on you regularly throughout the day, and Dr. Hatfield will visit every morning. That nice butler Fleming can appoint a footman to wait in the corridor, so your maid will be able to ask for anything you might like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s no need for that,\u201d Lady Rainsford said. \u201cLala can simply run down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but dear Lala will be with the party,\u201d Lady Adelaide said, smiling brightly. \u201cI know that the last thing you would want is to prevent your darling daughter from enjoying the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recommend absolute quiet,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cPeacefulness. You may ask your daughter to read to you for an hour in the afternoon if you wish, but other than that, I should like you to remain quite calm and entertain only an occasional visitor.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rainsford laughed, and before Lala drew a breath, she said, \u201cMy daughter can\u2019t read, so that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shall read to you,\u201d Lady Adelaide said swiftly, as Lala tried to blink back tears of pure humiliation.</p><p>Her mother wouldn\u2019t reveal such a thing in front of Mr. Dautry. Would she?</p><p>Dr. Hatfield met Lala\u2019s eyes and asked kindly, \u201cI trust you do not have a problem with your vision, Miss Rainsford?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head miserably. If only stupidity could be cured with spectacles, she would wear them happily.</p><p>Dr. Hatfield bent over the bed once more, hand on her mother\u2019s wrist. \u201cI am quite worried by the agitation of your pulse, Lady Rainsford. Those with a weak heart often overtax themselves, not realizing that their loved ones would actually prefer that they live a long and happy life.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rainsford opened her mouth again, but this time Lala jumped in. \u201cMama, I must beg you to take advantage of this opportunity to rest and recover from the journey. This chamber is charming.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, it was. A tall window stood open to the warm afternoon breeze, which carried in the fragrance of flowers. The walls were covered in a delicate patterned silk, and the rug on the floor glowed in the sunlight.</p><p>Lala had never been in such a tasteful bedchamber in her life, and she didn\u2019t think her mother had either. Well, at least not since those lauded days when her mother had served as a lady-in-waiting to the queen. Lala happened to know that her term of service had been a mere two months, but to hear her mother tell it, she had been the queen\u2019s most beloved companion.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about your daughter,\u201d Lady Adelaide was saying. \u201cI shall chaperone her fiercely, my dear, fiercely. I have done the same for Lady Xenobia, and I am proud to say that, even given Lady Xenobia\u2019s adventuresome constitution, not a hint of scandal has ever been breathed about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as to that,\u201d Lala\u2019s mother said, her voice sharpening, as it did when she was about to impart unpleasant news.</p><p>But Dr. Hatfield moved forward and said, \u201cLady Rainsford, I do not want you to stir from this bed for two days or I cannot be responsible for the consequences. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Lala saw her mother\u2019s eyes grow large.</p><p>\u201cYes, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>He bowed once again and headed for the door. Lala hurried after him, glad that she had her reticule, because she needed to pay him. And thank him, if she could think how to phrase it correctly.</p> <p>In the end, it wasn\u2019t hard to thank him, because he refused to hear it. And he refused payment as well, but merely looked at her and asked, \u201cWhat happens when you try to read?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so sympathetic that Lala told him the truth. \u201cNothing happens,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI can see letters and numbers, just like anyone else. I simply can\u2019t remember which ones go where. I\u2019m too\u2014I\u2019m too stupid for that.\u201d The last part came out in a whisper, even lower than she normally spoke, because she wished she didn\u2019t have to say it. Not to a man like this.</p><p>He had taken his hat from the butler and put it on. But he looked down at her, with his serious face and those beautiful navy eyes, and said, \u201cMiss Rainsford, I am quite certain that you are not stupid.\u201d</p><p>That was very kind of him. If untrue. \u201cPlease don\u2019t suggest that you can teach me to read,\u201d she said, noticing out of the corner of her eye that Fleming had taken himself away, and they were alone in the entry. \u201cMy parents paid dearly for tutor after tutor, but I simply can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I suspect you\u2019ll never be able to read,\u201d he said briskly.</p><p>Lala swallowed hard. She knew it; everyone knew it. Still, it was painful to hear, especially from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re likely not seeing the letters in the same order as everyone else. Or you see them in a different order each time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do see them in the same order as others. I can read aloud the individual letters.\u201d She could feel her cheeks glowing. \u201cAt any rate, Dr. Hatfield, I want to thank you again for your kind attentiveness to my mother. I know she\u2019ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Lady Xenobia popped her head out of the drawing room and said, \u201cGood afternoon, Dr. Hatfield! I trust Lady Rainsford is simply weary from the journey? Lala, once you have seen the doctor off, I thought you might join us. We\u2019re starting a game of whist, and you can partner Mr. Dautry.\u201d She disappeared again.</p><p>\u201cCan you play?\u201d the doctor asked.</p><p>Lala shook her head. The numbers on playing cards rattled around and slid off the cards, the same way that letters did from pages. \u201cI\u2019ll make an excuse.\u201d She began to drop a curtsy, but he caught her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t curtsy to a country doctor.\u201d</p><p>Another stupid mistake. By now, she was probably as red as a brightly painted children\u2019s ball. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t apologize either.\u201d His hand tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re to partner Mr. Dautry?\u201d</p><p>She met his eyes, knowing that her utter misery was undisguised. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, managing a wobbly smile. She\u2019d never had such an odd conversation in her life, but the important thing was that Dr. Hatfield wasn\u2019t disgusted by her inability to read or play cards. By her stupidity, in other words.</p><p>She could tell from the way he looked at her. Just as she could tell that he felt sorry for her, because he had guessed she was supposed to marry Mr. Dautry, and he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d suit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on rounds this afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you like to accompany me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go about to see my patients.\u201d He jerked his head toward the open door and his vehicle, a dilapidated black carriage.</p><p>Lala looked down at her morning dress and her slippers. His gaze followed hers.</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, his eyes going flat. \u201cMiss Rainsford, I apologize for such an untoward request. I must bid you good day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t go without a chaperone,\u201d she said, a little breathlessly.</p><p>His mouth tightened.</p><p>\u201cJust a maid,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd my bonnet! Wait, please wait. Just a moment.\u201d</p><p>Fleming miraculously reappeared and produced her bonnet as well as a maid, because Lala didn\u2019t have a lady\u2019s maid. And asking if her mother\u2019s maid could accompany her would ensure that Lady Rainsford learned of her daughter\u2019s improper excursion.</p><p>She was almost in the carriage before it occurred to her that she ought to leave notice with someone other than the butler. She ran back to the house, ignoring the fact that Dr. Hatfield would be able to see her from behind, and said breathlessly to Fleming, \u201cPlease tell Lady Adelaide that I\u2019ve gone on rounds.\u201d She turned without waiting for an answer.</p> <p>Which meant that she didn\u2019t see Fleming smile as he closed the door behind her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>As India dressed for dinner that night, her mind kept veering toward Thorn. She gave herself a silent scolding and made herself think about Lord Brody instead, but two minutes later she found herself slipping back to a memory of the way Thorn had kissed her good-night after they\u2019d walked home from the gatehouse.</p><p>Probably many women had memories like these. The fact that she\u2019d been happier in the hammock, in his arms, than she\u2019d ever been in her life . . . that was irrelevant. He belonged to someone else. He wanted someone else.</p><p>Not her.</p><p>Maybe if she told herself that daily for the next year, she would stop thinking about him.</p> <p>Even so, she dressed with more care than she had dressed for anything in her life, not allowing herself to think too hard about why she was determined to be\u2014what was the word Thorn had used? Delectable.</p><p>The gown she put on was very nearly indecent, only because fashion and her bosom were not in agreement. It was made of transparent rose-tinted silk that swooped in drapes around the bodice before falling to the floor. But there wasn\u2019t much bodice. In fact, the top only barely kept her covered and the sleeves were no more than a frail length of gauze. Marie bound up her hair in the front, with one of the newest bandeau, and left all the rest of it to tumble down her back.</p><p>\u201cIt would be better if I could get your hair to take a curl,\u201d Marie fretted. She was fixing rosebuds to India\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cI think it looks quite well,\u201d India said. Marie had shadowed her eyes with kohl and painted her lips a darker rose than her gown. Her only jewelry was a bracelet, a thin band of silver decorated with an amethyst, very high on her right arm. \u201cShould you add a few of those amethyst pins?\u201d she asked, standing up and turning slightly in order to see her back in the glass.</p><p>\u201cJust a few,\u201d Marie agreed, nimbly setting to work. When she was done, each rosebud had a tiny sparkle, a flicker of purple light that highlighted the unusual color of India\u2019s hair.</p><p>India slid her feet into narrow slippers embroidered with spangles, with ribbons that crossed her ankles, just in case a gentleman caught sight of her legs.</p><p>She made herself think about Lord Brody as she went down the stairs. Thorn was right. Brody was a far better catch than the men who had courted her to this point: he was powerful and graceful at the same time. You could take one look at him and know that he would fight off a marauding elephant.</p><p>What\u2019s more\u2014and even more importantly\u2014she felt instinctively that he wasn\u2019t a bully. He would respect his wife and allow her to make most decisions on her own. He would be a peaceful and calm husband, unlike Thorn, whose wife would probably find herself quarrelling with him once a day.</p> <p>When she reached the entry, Fleming escorted her to the drawing room and announced her, quite as if they hadn\u2019t been working side by side for the last week.</p><p>Everyone turned around when she entered. Eleanor and Adelaide smiled; the duke looked surprised. Thorn was standing at the mantelpiece with Lord Brody. He froze when he caught sight of her, and his whole face changed.</p><p>India let a little smile play on her lips, because she liked the look in his eyes.</p><p>The duke and duchess walked across the room while she was giving Thorn a silent lesson in all the ways he had been mistaken in his assessment of her wardrobe. His Grace bowed, and drawled, \u201cI will take the advantage of my age to say what every man in this room is thinking, Lady Xenobia. You look extraordinarily beautiful.\u201d</p><p>India smiled at him and dropped a curtsy. Eleanor leaned forward and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m seeing a whole new India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am retiring,\u201d India explained. \u201cI felt some new gowns were called for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this rate, you will cut a swath through the ton,\u201d the duke remarked. \u201cPerhaps I should warn the unsuspecting men in my club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the duchess said, her eyes dancing. \u201cMy guess is that India will be affianced before the next season begins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no need to rush,\u201d India told them.</p><p>Lord Brody joined them. \u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d he said, dropping into a bow as he took her hand and kissed it. \u201cYou take my breath away. That,\u201d he said, straightening, \u201cis a tired remark, but nonetheless true.\u201d</p><p>Thorn strolled over, but his face was not nearly as admiring as Lord Brody\u2019s. He bowed, but he didn\u2019t add a flourish, nor did he kiss her hand.</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d Lord Brody said, turning his back on Thorn. \u201cWould you walk with me?\u201d</p><p>India took his arm and let herself enjoy the sensation of walking away from Thorn, so that he could see her hair down.</p><p>Lord Brody shared Thorn\u2019s overtly masculine air, but at the same time, he was civilized. They moved slowly around the room, talking of his stables. Before she knew it, India was offering suggestions. They had just rounded the corner when she said, \u201cFor example, why do stalls always have swinging doors? It would be much easier to negotiate a horse out of a stall if the door slid, instead of swinging open.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at that moment to discover Thorn blocking their path.</p><p>\u201cNo one told me this was the time to promenade,\u201d he said, his tone growly and irritated.</p><p>India wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cThorn, don\u2019t you agree that stalls should have sliding doors rather than swinging ones?\u201d</p><p>Brody made a sharp movement and\u2014too late\u2014she realized that she had betrayed an entirely scandalous intimacy. \u201cDo forgive me for addressing Mr. Dautry with such familiarity, Lord Brody. He and I are quite like siblings, as I have long been friends with Her Grace.\u201d</p><p>That was true . . . and not true. It was true that she had been friends with Eleanor for years. It was most decidedly untrue that she had sisterly feelings for Thorn.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Lord Brody said, \u201cI insist that you use my Christian name as well. Would you do me the honor of addressing me as Vander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis real name is Evander,\u201d Thorn told India. \u201cWe both arrived at Eton as boys, whereupon Vander had to pummel any number of boys who thought it amusing to address him as Eve.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you always win?\u201d India asked Vander, delighted to think of the two of them as boys.</p><p>He looked at her with a warm light in his eyes that was remarkably attractive. \u201cThe only one I couldn\u2019t beat was Thorn. And that\u2019s because he\u2019s an underhanded fighter\u2014as you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>India raised an eyebrow. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>Thorn rocked back on his heels, and the look in his eyes wasn\u2019t warm but scorching, and made her think about the night before. And Feather\u2019s exploits. \u201cThose fellows were bound by the rules of civility,\u201d he said, drawling the words so that he sounded exactly like his father, the duke. \u201cI never have been.\u201d</p> <p>Vander intervened. \u201cLady Xenobia,\u201d he said, \u201cI would love to discuss sliding doors, but I see that Lady Adelaide is summoning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look exquisite!\u201d her godmother cried a moment later, squeezing India\u2019s hands. She bent close and whispered, \u201cAnd both those young men are completely smitten, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d India replied, as softly. \u201cWe both know where Thorn\u2019s affections lie, and I have barely met Lord Brody.\u201d</p><p>Adelaide chortled. \u201cOh, really? What do you think they\u2019re discussing right now?\u201d</p><p>India glanced over her shoulder to see that Vander and Thorn were indeed talking to each other with unhappy looks on their faces. One might even say angry looks.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve set them against one another,\u201d Adelaide said happily.</p><p>\u201cThey are probably discussing the weather,\u201d India said firmly. \u201cI haven\u2019t said hello to Lala yet, and I must inquire about Lady Rainsford\u2019s health.\u201d</p><p>Lala and Eleanor were seated in chairs that India had arranged before the great windows looking toward the back gardens. She and Adelaide joined them, and discovered that Lala\u2014who, in India\u2019s experience, was almost always silent\u2014was babbling about having accompanied Dr. Hatfield on his rounds.</p><p>\u201cThe baby,\u201d Lala was saying, \u201cis no bigger than a scrap.\u201d She cradled her arm to show Eleanor the size. \u201cBut she has a tuft of red hair, and she was quite good at nursing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Dr. Hatfield allow you to see a child being born?\u201d Adelaide asked, scandalized.</p><p>In the normal course of events, no young lady was allowed to witness something so indecorous. Last year, however, Mrs. Carlyle had demanded that India hold her hand, and Adelaide had given in. India had found it fascinating. A bit terrifying, but fascinating.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly not! Little Martha is two weeks old,\u201d Lala said.</p><p>Her eyes shone, and she went on to discuss the medical aspects of the mother\u2019s confinement in a way that made India seriously rethink the commonly held presumption that Miss Laetitia Rainsford was missing a carriage wheel, if not two.</p><p>This must be what Thorn sees in Lala, she thought, losing the thread of the conversation when Lala went on to tell Adelaide and Eleanor the proper treatment for scabies. No one in society had glimpsed this side of Lala, but Thorn must understand her better than anyone.</p><p>When the dinner gong sounded, the duchess took her husband\u2019s arm and said to Thorn, \u201cDarling, please accompany Miss Rainsford to the table. Lord Brody, would you be kind enough to offer an arm to both Lady Xenobia and Lady Adelaide?\u201d</p><p>Adelaide chattered all the way to the dining room; India silently held Vander\u2019s other arm. He glanced down at her and his smile widened. Thorn, on the other hand, was obviously still cross; as he pulled out Lala\u2019s chair, he snapped India a look that held more than a hint of fury.</p><p>Though what he had to be angry about, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>True, Starberry was no longer her concern, but she couldn\u2019t help but notice how well the staff had followed her directions regarding the table setting. Lush white peonies in low baskets graced the middle of the table, and the linens\u2014she had bought three different settings\u2014were slate-blue Japanese silk brocade that accented the gray-green walls.</p><p>She slid her fingers from Vander\u2019s arm as he pulled out a chair for Adelaide, and in the second before he turned back to her, Thorn appeared at her side and said, \u201cYou\u2019re sitting beside me.\u201d</p> <p>He whisked her around the table so that she was opposite Vander. \u201cThat was extremely impolite, even for you,\u201d India observed when he sat down between Lala and herself.</p><p>\u201cIn truth I am showing my first signs of civilized behavior,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cIf that bodice falls off your milky way, I shall throw my napkin over you before Vander ogles you even more than he already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not ogling me!\u201d India hissed.</p><p>\u201cBosh,\u201d Thorn retorted. \u201cHe\u2019s eating you alive and you\u2019re oblivious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no call for you to\u2014\u201d India began, but then she realized that the duke, seated at her right hand, was listening with apparent interest. \u201cPlease forgive me, Your Grace,\u201d she said, turning her shoulder to Thorn.</p><p>\u201cI too find my son to be extremely irritating,\u201d the duke said. \u201cI have nothing but sympathy. Do tell me, Lady Xenobia, who painted the swallows on the walls?\u201d</p><p>During the meal India talked primarily with the duke and also with Vander, who completely ignored the protocol that dictated one should not speak across a table. They began by talking of Italian painters, but quickly turned to the duke\u2019s new silk top hat.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to cause a riot by wearing it in public,\u201d he said in a disappointed tone. \u201cBut not even one woman fainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I to infer, Your Grace,\u201d India asked, enjoying herself enormously, \u201cthat your attire regularly causes loss of consciousness?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor clapped her hands, and it turned out that Vander had a most appealing laugh, low and husky.</p><p>\u201cYou injure me, my dear,\u201d the duke protested. \u201cNot long ago, John Hetherington wore a top hat and caused a riot. He was fined five hundred pounds for creating a public disturbance. I wore a similar top hat to the opera a mere six months after his, and not even a dog barked at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLondon is used to you being in the very forefront of fashion,\u201d his wife said soothingly, but there was a twinkle in her eye.</p><p>\u201cI grow old, I grow old,\u201d the duke said, not mournfully. \u201cSoon I shall wear flannel waistcoats and my trousers rolled, and all this elegance will be naught more than a distant memory.\u201d</p><p>India laughed at that, as did Eleanor, both of them perfectly well aware that when the duke was laid to rest\u2014hopefully many years from now\u2014he would be the best-dressed corpse in all England.</p><p>\u201cDo you own a top hat, Lord Brody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m decidedly not in the forefront of fashion,\u201d he said, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we\u2019re lucky that you\u2019re even wearing a cravat,\u201d the duke said. \u201cThe younger generation takes no pride in their appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m properly dressed,\u201d Vander protested. But anyone could tell by looking at him that he wouldn\u2019t be caught dead wearing lace cuffs like those peeping from the duke\u2019s velvet sleeves.</p><p>After that, the conversation wandered, from the new smallpox vaccine, to the new book of poetry called the Lyrical Ballads that the duke declared to be audacious, shocking, and ultimately tedious. The duke\u2019s dry witticisms and Vander\u2019s sardonic parries kept making the three of them break into laughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorn, Adelaide, and Lala, on the other hand, were engaged in a serious discussion of childhood mortality in the countryside. India found it a particularly unhappy topic, because two years ago she had spent a month with Lady Brestle, who was experiencing a difficult confinement. Alas, she\u2019d lost the child.</p><p>India had been the one to order the coffin\u2014a box so tiny that it was painful to think about. She removed the rough cambric the village carpenter used to line it, and replaced it with the finest azure silk she could find, because that was the color of the family\u2019s crest.</p><p>She did not want to think about that baby. Instead, she wanted to flirt with Lord Brody under her lashes and look speculatively at his shoulders, and wonder whether he kissed the way Thorn did.</p><p>She suspected that no one kissed the way Thorn did, not with his roughness and heat . . . but if any gentleman did, she thought Vander might be that gentleman. Perhaps she would kiss him tonight, and then she would have grounds for comparison. With that thought, she gave him a smile that made him raise an eyebrow and then give her a surprisingly attractive, rather crooked, smile in return.</p> <p>When dinner concluded, the ladies retired to the sitting room for tea and the men took themselves off to the library for brandy. India listened to Adelaide\u2019s chatter for a short time, before excusing herself. She wanted to drop by the dower house, just to make certain that Rose was comfortable and happy.</p><p>In the entry she told Fleming that she\u2019d like the pony cart in order to drive herself to the dower house for a visit. As she pulled on her gloves, Lord Brody walked out of the library.</p><p>\u201cThat was a quick brandy,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cThorn deserted us\u2014characteristically rudely, without explanation\u2014and the duke began a game of chess with himself, a pursuit that is profoundly tedious to watch. Where on earth are you going at this hour, Lady Xenobia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to take the pony cart for a turn around the estate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent! I shall join you. Fleming, my coat, if you would.\u201d</p><p>A minute later, despite India\u2019s protests, they were sitting side by side in the cart. She tried one final desperate appeal. \u201cLord Brody, I fail to see why you are accompanying me. This is not entirely proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are in the country, not town. And no lady will venture alone into the darkness while I am here,\u201d he said, as the groom standing at the pony\u2019s head stood back. \u201cFleming didn\u2019t like it. One must always listen to the butler; it\u2019s the fundamental rule of polite society.\u201d</p><p>Fleming had gently made his disapproval clear.</p><p>\u201cThorn wouldn\u2019t like it either,\u201d he added as they began to head toward the dower house.</p><p>\u201cThat is irrelevant,\u201d she said, turning her nose up slightly. \u201cMr. Dautry takes advantage of our long acquaintance. I begin to think he is a bully.\u201d</p> <p>At that, Vander gave a shout of laughter. \u201cYou begin to think? Thorn gets his way. Always. He\u2019s been that way since our first term at Eton, when he was the only one I couldn\u2019t thrash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are quite odd,\u201d India said, thinking about that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had each other\u2019s backs ever since,\u201d he said, glancing down at her. \u201cWhere would you like to go, Lady Xenobia? And may I say that if you are planning to visit Miss Rose, I would like to meet Thorn\u2019s ward. I know his secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my idea to house the child apart from the party,\u201d India confessed, \u201cbut I feel terrible about the necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were Thorn, I would tell the woman to go to\u2014\u201d He checked himself. \u201cTo keep her opinions to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he were to do that, he wouldn\u2019t be able to marry Lala,\u201d she told him. \u201cHe told me that she\u2019s perfect for him. And he meant it.\u201d She glanced at Vander. \u201cLala is not as unintelligent as most people think, and Thorn recognizes that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very sweet,\u201d India went on, although it was oddly painful to admit it. \u201cI believe they\u2019ll have an excellent marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorn pretends to be cynical, but I believe he\u2019s infatuated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be losing my touch,\u201d Vander said rather obscurely, giving her a grin that made his teeth flash in the growing dusk. \u201cYou become suspicious in the horse racing world, you know. You stop thinking that people might actually mean what they say.\u201d</p><p>She touched his hand. \u201cCan you take the path to the right, please? We\u2019re almost at the dower house. If you\u2019re referring to Thorn, it\u2019s my impression that he wouldn\u2019t bother lying to anyone.\u201d</p><p>The smile in his eyes made her squirm a little, and she had the odd feeling that he knew it.</p><p>The pony cart drew up to the dower house and Vander jumped down, reins in hand. As he fastened them to the hitching post, Thorn pushed open the front door.</p><p>\u201cWe came to say good-night to Rose,\u201d India called.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cHer nursemaid is waiting upstairs to give Rose a bath.\u201d</p><p>Vander came around the cart, and before India quite knew what was happening, his hands spanned her waist and he was swinging her to the ground.</p><p>\u201cCome along, then,\u201d Thorn said impatiently.</p><p>Vander looked down at her for a second longer, then his hands dropped and he and India followed Thorn inside.</p><p>Once Vander and Rose had been introduced, Vander launched into a story about a faraway land where paper dolls walked and talked like anyone else. \u201cTheir mama is called Lady Cuttenclip,\u201d he told Rose. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t just create dolls. She makes them cunning little hats, pelisses, shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies do not, as a matter of course, make clothing,\u201d Rose observed. \u201cIs everyone in this land of the same status?\u201d</p><p>Vander looked distinctly startled. \u201cSurely we need not be so doctrinaire? My sisters are assuredly ladies, and yet they spent hours designing gowns for their dolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you design clothing for paper dolls?\u201d Rose asked, turning to India.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that was merely because I had no paints as a child. I would have enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>Rose looked at her thoughtfully and then turned back to Vander. \u201cHow does Lady Cuttenclip acquire paints for her dolls if the world is made of paper? Do they trade paper coins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Vander said.</p><p>\u201cI have very little interest in being a modiste,\u201d Rose announced. \u201cI should rather create a paper house with a nursery and a fireplace with burning logs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shelves will be full of tiny Greek texts, of course,\u201d Thorn said, laughing.</p><p>Rose looked up at India. \u201cPerhaps you could help, since you had no paints when you were small. If you wished, you could make a gown, but I shall make a schoolroom.\u201d</p><p>India found herself promising to come back at teatime the following day. Vander invited himself, pointing out that since Lady Cuttenclip was his creation, they couldn\u2019t do without him.</p><p>Rose smiled at that, and India realized that she had dimples. Two of them. She wasn\u2019t a pretty child, per se, but those dimples . . .</p><p>\u201cMy papa used to tell me a story at night,\u201d Rose said, turning to India again. \u201cMr. Dautry isn\u2019t good at storytelling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would be happy to tell you a bedtime story,\u201d India said, holding out her hand. \u201cI expect that Rose\u2019s nursemaid is waiting, gentlemen, so why don\u2019t you return to the house, and I will join you later? I worry that the other guests will find it odd that the three of us have disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going about the grounds by yourself at night,\u201d Thorn stated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing precisely that for weeks,\u201d India pointed out.</p><p>Vander intervened. \u201cI am happy to wait for you, Lady Xenobia. Thorn, your parents will be wondering where you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be quite improper for you to escort India,\u201d Thorn said, folding his arms across his chest. \u201cIn fact, you shouldn\u2019t have accompanied her here without a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet it wouldn\u2019t be improper for you?\u201d Vander said, clearly irritated.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Since Thorn didn\u2019t elaborate, India said, \u201cMr. Dautry and I are such old friends that we don\u2019t concern ourselves with propriety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are feeling protective?\u201d Vander asked Thorn.</p> <p>\u201cNo one is going to compromise India under my roof,\u201d Thorn said.</p><p>This was barked more than stated, but Vander\u2019s eyes cleared and he gave Thorn one of those slaps on the back that men give each other. \u201cI was wrong, earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bid you good-night, gentlemen,\u201d India said. She took Rose away, but not before she heard Vander saying that Thorn had done him the greatest favor of his life.</p><p>She smiled all the way up the stairs and through story time, a new experience for her inasmuch as that her mother had never contemplated such a thing. Taking inspiration from Vander\u2019s paper dolls, she came up with a world of civilized rabbits. Runnebunny was a rascal bunny, hopping all over the place and stealing everyone\u2019s cabbage. But he also had the longest ears and the blackest eyes of any rabbit in the county.</p><p>\u201cYour story is rather babyish, but I do like Mr. Runnebunny,\u201d Rose said sleepily. \u201cHe\u2019s just like Mr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d India said, pulling up Rose\u2019s covers. \u201cWell, tomorrow, I\u2019ll tell you more about Lord Parsley, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like him just as much. He\u2019s far more civilized, and you know that\u2019s important in a bunny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Rose said, snuggling down into her covers, her doll in the crook of her arm. \u201cAntigone and I think that it\u2019s better that a bunny be able to steal lots of cabbage to ensure that his baby bunnies don\u2019t go hungry.\u201d</p><p>India lingered for a moment, thinking that she had inadvertently managed to make her story appallingly revealing. Then she kissed the sleeping child on the cheek and headed down the stairs.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Thorn drank two glasses of brandy while he waited for India. He had never felt so damned undecided. In point of fact, he was never undecided. Ever. Generally, he decided which path was best, and took it.</p><p>He knew instinctively that Lala was the woman for him. She was warm and sweet and uncomplicated. It was unfortunate that she was also a little boring, especially now that she had learned about infant mortality; Thorn was completely uninterested, but he could live with it.</p><p>Her affection would bind his family together. Moreover, her concern with infant mortality suggested that she would make every effort to nourish and raise their children in the best possible fashion.</p><p>India, on the other hand, was like a dissected map, one of those new puzzles she had bought for Rose. No piece seemed to fit with another, and half of them hinted at some unknown country, rich, deep, and undiscovered.</p><p>Even though he had deliberately invited Vander to his house party, when his friend had thanked him for introducing him to India, his eyes betraying an intensity of feeling that Thorn had only seen when Vander was at the races . . . well, then Thorn had contemplated killing him.</p> <p>Ridiculous.</p><p>He was losing his mind. He took another gulp of brandy. It was probably all a matter of competition with Vander. India was one of the most beautiful women he\u2019d ever seen\u2014and she was the daughter of a marquess, intelligent, witty, and rich to boot.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that he\u2019d never enjoyed shagging a woman more. Simply looking at her made him fall into a black well where there was nothing but her smell, her taste, the stroke of her fingers.</p><p>One should never succumb to one\u2019s lowest instincts. Thorn had learned to curb his desires, to relegate strong emotions to a category labeled \u201cinteresting.\u201d Lala would be his wife, whereas India was, and India would be, his friend.</p><p>It was odd, having a woman as a friend, but if she married Vander, he would see\u2014</p><p>Before he knew it, he was out of the chair, his body taut as a bowstring. His imagination had fed him a picture of India in that blue nightdress, smiling at Vander on their wedding night. With a curse, he hurled his glass directly into the fireplace, shattering it.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He turned to find India in the doorway, looking confused. The rich smell of brandy spread through the room. In one stride he was face to face with her, and then she was in his arms. He didn\u2019t bother with civility, not this time. He didn\u2019t coax her lips open, but took her mouth with all the pent-up force of a man who\u2019s just imagined the unimaginable.</p><p>His tongue conquered her mouth, claimed, possessed, made it his own. His. His.</p><p>Not Vander\u2019s. Never Vander\u2019s.</p><p>One arm clamped tight around her and then he was tasting her, tasting India, and her mouth was sweeter than he remembered, their kiss hotter, wetter, deeper. By the time he dragged his mouth away, he had backed her against the wall, his hips grinding into her softness, one hand bound in that gorgeous hair. His body was roaring with heat and fire, muscles taut, ready for the command to take her to bed. Hell, take her to the floor, to the sofa, even just against the wall.</p><p>Just take her.</p><p>He looked down to dazed eyes and cherry lips. Reality came crashing into his mind, and he jolted back with a curse. India swayed precariously when he let her go, so he reached out and caught her, carrying her to the sofa.</p><p>He meant to sit opposite, but somehow he ended up with her in his lap.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t yet said a word.</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d he said, and hesitated.</p><p>She turned her head, her lips only a breath away from his. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Her voice was as unsteady as her legs had been, and he thought she was trembling. Just a little, but trembling nonetheless. \u201cWe agreed there could be no repeat of last night.\u201d</p><p>She deserved an honest answer. \u201cCompetition,\u201d he confirmed.</p><p>There was a flash in her eyes\u2014surely not pain? But when she spoke, her voice was steady. \u201cCompetition? Over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompetition between myself and Vander,\u201d he said, forcing the words out.</p><p>\u201cYou are competing for me?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back, the better to see his eyes, and Thorn was appalled to discover that he didn\u2019t even like that small distance between them. Some part of his mind thought talking was a waste of time, and he should kiss that little indent at the base of her throat. Lick it. And lick his way down the curve of her breast.</p><p>He wanted to know if she tasted as sweet all over, every inch of her. There were parts of her that he hadn\u2019t had time to kiss the night before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s instinctual,\u201d he explained, pulling his mind back from the bed. \u201cVander is my closest friend, and one of the few people I trust in the world. I\u2019ve measured myself against him since we were at Eton.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen he was unable to pummel you into the ground,\u201d she said, faint distaste in her voice revealing just what she thought of this sort of male conduct.</p><p>It was idiocy. It was also, unfortunately, the way he was made. \u201cVander and I are slightly cracked in that respect,\u201d he acknowledged, ignoring the fact that he was playing with her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou just kissed me because you are competitive with Vander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said bluntly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d she said, sitting up straighter, which pressed the curve of her bottom against his legs. And his cock.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense to men,\u201d he managed, which was pretty miraculous given that he was in the grip of a lust stronger than he\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cMen are absurd,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be giving in to the impulse to kiss a woman merely because your friend showed interest in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that,\u201d he said, as his gaze caught on her rosy lips. Without thinking, he rolled over, tucking her beneath him, his body rejoicing as he sank onto her soft curves.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he whispered, sending the words straight into the warmth of her mouth. \u201cYou make me lose my mind, India.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t reply, just slid a hand in his hair and pulled his mouth down to hers.</p><p>Thorn was no gentleman. He never had been, and he never would be. Still, even as he shifted his weight, just enough to run a hand over India\u2019s lush breasts, his conscience started nagging.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go . . . where this was going. But he couldn\u2019t stop either, because the moment his hand touched her breast, she gasped and her head arched back, exposing a neck as lovely as the rest of her. Leaning forward to kiss it made his hips press into her, bringing a wave of lust more ferocious than anything he\u2019d experienced since adolescence.</p><p>He smoothed a hand down her throat, a whisper-soft caress, and kissed the curve of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she replied, and he could tell she steadied her voice with difficulty. \u201cMore competition?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned beautiful, India. There\u2019s no red-blooded man in the world who wouldn\u2019t want to be in my place. Hell, I feel sorry for all those men who fell in love with you, house by house. You probably ruined them for married life.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth was bruised a deep red by his kiss, and he found he hadn\u2019t the heart to care. Her lips curved in a slow smile, and he felt that smile in his own body. Between his legs. \u201cYour hair is like the white of the sun if you stare straight into the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair is not white,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m not that old yet. I think I would enjoy your competition if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I\u2019m the bone you and Vander are squabbling over.\u201d She corrected herself before he could respond. \u201cNo: over which you and Vander are squabbling.\u201d</p><p>Thorn didn\u2019t want to think about Vander. \u201cWhat was wrong with the way you said it the first time?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Then her brow cleared and she said, \u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t know, because you were a mudlark. If I end a sentence with \u2018over,\u2019 that\u2019s ungrammatical. At least, I think it is.\u201d</p><p>Thorn started winding locks of her hair around his fingers. He\u2019d never felt anything so silky in his life. \u201cIf you were a trollop, I\u2019d pay a bloody fortune to have all this hair of yours sliding over my bare skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorn!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d shocked her. A bit. \u201cWhy are you worrying about grammar? Who cares if a sentence isn\u2019t exactly right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. And you ought to as well. It\u2019s hard to catch up because I hadn\u2019t a governess, and it must be the same for you. You\u2019re behind. You must catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>It was a simple question, but her brow knit. \u201cBecause it\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be perfect?\u201d He was quite aware that perfection was outside his grasp. What\u2019s more, he saw perfection in his father and thought it was over-rated.</p><p>\u201cThe best you can be,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you have a governess?\u201d</p><p>Her face changed, and he didn\u2019t like her expression. He leaned down and took her mouth again, a reckless, raw kiss that made their tongues mimic what their bodies might do. When at last he jerked his head back, they were both breathing fast, hearts pounding against each other\u2019s body, probably in unison, he thought hazily.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me,\u201d he whispered, running his fingertips along the curve of her jaw. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you have a governess?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were half closed. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford one. My parents never wanted one, because my mother thought society\u2019s strictures were tiresome.\u201d Her voice lilted when she said the last sentence, as if she were quoting a woman long dead.</p><p>\u201cI knew there had to be a good reason I grew up on the streets,\u201d he said, bending his neck so that his mouth could trace the same path as his fingers. \u201cNot knowing any of those strictures means I\u2019ve never had to worry about them.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head, and his lips brushed her cheek. \u201cI find it hard to imagine you worrying about any rules, social or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t keep going like this, India, or we\u2019ll find ourselves in bed again,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cAnd we cannot do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we can\u2019t,\u201d she said, not moving. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is to be forced to marry someone who is only kissing me because of a childhood rivalry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am to marry Lala,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cI would never do anything to stand in the way of your and Lala\u2019s union. Do you know, Thorn, I think that if the ton saw her the way she was tonight at dinner, she never would have been labeled a simpleton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA simpleton?\u201d That took him aback.</p><p>\u201cObviously, quite untrue,\u201d India said, \u201cand I shall squash those rumors just as soon as the new season begins. Lala bloomed tonight. I think her mother might be responsible for some of her problems.\u201d</p><p>Thorn didn\u2019t want to talk anymore about his future wife. Or think about her, though he had to admit that he didn\u2019t like the word \u201csimpleton.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s thoughts were going in a quite different direction, because she got a crooked little smile on her lips and said, \u201cUnfortunately for your competitive side, Thorn, I like Vander.\u201d</p><p>The smug feeling in his gut evaporated.</p><p>\u201cYou were absolutely right about him,\u201d she went on, apparently not noticing that he\u2019d gone rigid. \u201cHe\u2019s manly, the way you are. He\u2019s interesting and amusing and smart. And you saw how wonderful he was with Rose earlier; he\u2019ll make a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>Thorn briskly rolled both of them to a sitting position. \u201cIf you accept Vander\u2019s offer, India\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has made no offer!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cIf he does, you must never tell him that we were intimate. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of your competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the kind of friends we are.\u201d He and Vander were welded together like brothers, and a fracture would be deadly. In fact, he had an uneasy feeling that whether or not Vander learned the truth, the very fact he had slept with his future wife might shatter their bond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said, pushing her hair behind her shoulders. \u201cI really must get back now, Thorn. Adelaide will be wondering where I am.\u201d</p><p>Looking at her, Thorn suddenly understood what could lead a man to break all the rules of civility in order to bind a woman to him. Put India\u2019s intelligence and passion together with her shapeliness, her mouth, her laugh, even that beauty mark . . . she was enough to drive a man to madness.</p><p>\u201cYou must tell me the moment that Vander proposes,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAre you saying I need your blessing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe must not kiss after you are promised to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re implying . . .\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, Lala wasn\u2019t his yet, and India wasn\u2019t Vander\u2019s yet. So he kissed her.</p><p>But something still bothered him. \u201cYou were not walking easily earlier today,\u201d he said, tracing her lower lip with his finger.</p><p>India\u2019s eyes had a desirous look that made him long to push her backward and simply thrust into her. Not that he would, but he wanted to.</p> <p>Oh God, did he want to.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you walked around the drawing room with Vander . . . your movement was rather stiff.\u201d</p><p>The dazed expression in her eyes disappeared; she straightened and scowled at him. But her lip was swollen from his kisses, and her frown just made him harder, hungrier. Still . . . he had to know.</p><p>\u201cYou walked as if you had been a virgin last night,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>It was one thing if Lady Xenobia India was a loose woman, practiced in the arts of shaking the sheets, taking her pleasure where she would. He would never fault a woman for that, any more than he would fault himself.</p> <p>But if he had seduced a virgin . . . Actually, there was something oddly relieving about the thought. He\u2019d have to marry her. They would fight all the time. They\u2019d probably make each other miserable. But he would have no other choice.</p><p>\u201cIndia?\u201d It came out like a command, though he had meant it only as a question.</p><p>She picked up a heavy fall of silky hair and pushed it behind one shoulder. \u201cI fail to see why I should share the history of my intimacies with you. As I told you, I was not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>He watched her carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe you.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to her feet. She looked outraged, like Juno fighting with Jupiter. This could be his life. He couldn\u2019t help himself, and grinned at her, which just made her angrier.</p><p>\u201cYou are insisting that I say this aloud again? Then I will. You were not the first.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was definite. Thorn was well aware that his pang of disappointment was absurd. He had forced her to admit something that no lady would wish to announce. He was an oaf, a thoughtless, mannerless oaf.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an idiot,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI thought you were walking stiffly.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him one last furious glance and turned on her heel. \u201cI shall return to the house in the pony cart, and you can find your own way back, Mr. Dautry.\u201d With that, she was gone.</p><p>Thorn climbed the stairs and entered the nursery. Rose was curled on her side, arms around Antigone, all that duckling hair of hers spread over the covers. He leaned down and kissed her good-night.</p><p>Instead of returning to the main house, he walked to the gatehouse, to the bedchamber where he\u2019d bedded India the night before.</p><p>He stripped to the skin, because that\u2019s the way he always slept, and slipped naked between sheets that still had the faintest scent of India. She had called her perfume \u201cmoonflower.\u201d He\u2019d never heard of it.</p><p>They probably didn\u2019t have moonflowers in London; certainly there were no flowers down by the Thames. He lay awake, hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling for a long time.</p><p>Perhaps it was time to put the Thames behind him. He was tired of measuring his life by whether a mudlark would have known what a moonflower was. Who cared? At the heart of it, the really important point was that India smelled like a woman beneath that delicate trace of flower.</p><p>Not just any woman, either: India. Spicy, sweet, bold, desirous.</p><p>He\u2019d never had a woman like her before. Even thinking of the way she moaned, low in her throat, made him harden to the point of pain.</p><p>Yet his life was planned. There was no space for a woman who made him feel unmoored. He had to shovel all this feeling back into a hole in the ground and bury it.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t healthy. Some madness was making him imagine, over and over, the journey from the gatehouse to the main house. A quiet trip up the stairs, a left turn, and straight to India\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>She slept deeply, and she wouldn\u2019t wake when he entered the room. Not until he drew back the covers and slid into the bed, naked, ready, his hands slipping beneath her nightdress. Even the thought of touching her limbs made his cock throb.</p><p>And that slapped him back to reality. Had he lost his mind? One woman and one night, and he forgot reason and logic? He wasn\u2019t a gentleman, but that didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t have an obligation to Lala.</p><p>He did.</p><p>Plus India was exactly what Vander wanted. They would have a marriage like that between his father and Eleanor. Exactly what Vander had talked of. Their children would have India\u2019s hair.</p><p>He and Lala . . . well, they wouldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t a simpleton, the way everyone in the ton thought, but she wasn\u2019t India, either. They would have children as well.</p><p>It was unfortunate that the thought of babies with Lala\u2019s timid expression, even if they had her dazzling beauty, made him feel slightly queasy, but that was the truth of it. He would be kind to his wife, and she would follow him about the way a duckling follows its mother, quiet, docile, obedient . . . sweet and fluffy.</p><p>Thorn reared up, punched his pillow violently, and lay back down. No more kissing India, touching India, making love to India . . .</p><p>That was for Vander now.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>The next day India didn\u2019t see Thorn until evening. She spent a less-than-wonderful morning talking to Lala and her mother, who had come downstairs for a few hours before retreating back to her bed. And in the afternoon she helped Rose create an elaborate schoolroom from paper, complete with a bookshelf and fireplace.</p><p>\u201cWhere on earth have you been?\u201d she asked, as Thorn came into the drawing room before supper.</p><p>\u201cThe factory. Look at this, India.\u201d He pulled something from his pocket and showed her a queer-looking string that seemed to form a closed circle, without a knot or seam.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe band you wanted. Made of rubber. We were able to solve the problem once we made it small, which I never considered.\u201d He gave her a smile so glowing that India\u2019s heart actually thumped.</p><p>She took the band and stretched it. \u201cThis is brilliant,\u201d she said, muttering because she was thinking of all the ways she could use it. \u201cCan you make me more? I\u2019d like one about half this size, and one twice as large too.\u201d</p><p>He started laughing, which caught the attention of the whole party. They all came over and stood around, admiring the band.</p><p>Lala was particularly enthralled. Her eyes became very bright, and she came up with a plan to put the ear trumpet Dr. Hatfield used to listen to people\u2019s chests on a band around his neck. \u201cHe kept putting it down,\u201d she told everyone, \u201cand some houses are not as clean as they might be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes the ear trumpet have articulated joints?\u201d Thorn asked her, after which he and Lala got into a long discussion about whether it would be possible to create a flexible tube, using Thorn\u2019s galvanized rubber, that would preserve sound better than the current model.</p><p>Eleanor had invited Dr. Hatfield to dinner as a thank you for his faithful attendance on the convalescent Lady Rainsford; once he arrived and they were all seated at the table, Thorn brought up the ear trumpet again.</p><p>Secretly\u2014and shamefully\u2014India became rather cross as she watched Lala become a shining, smiling woman who easily held the attention of her end of the table. Vander had made no bones about finding the subject boring\u2014that is, until Lala pointed out that if the trumpet was modified to have a longer tube of rubber, one might be able to listen to horse\u2019s hearts. Or even stomachs, to see whether they might have colic.</p><p>Thorn wasn\u2019t seated beside India tonight; he was across the table. Their eyes met once, and he gave her a little frown. She turned away and managed to get into an interesting conversation with his father about the recent income tax Pitt had established.</p> <p>When supper concluded, and the women retired to the drawing room, India tried to decide whether she could sneak away to pay another visit to Rose. If she went to the dower house once again, Thorn might assume that she was sending him a message. Flirting with him.</p><p>Instead she sat down and wrote Rose a little goodnight story about Lord Parsley, which she gave to Fleming with a request that it be delivered to the dower house.</p><p>She felt a bit wistful, remembering how she had told Rose that she would tell her more of the story in person.</p><p>But it was better this way.</p><p>The last thing a motherless little girl needed was to form an attachment to a woman she\u2019d never see again.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>After breakfast the following morning, Lala went upstairs and seated herself on a hassock in her mother\u2019s bedchamber, appearing to be a dutiful daughter while in reality she dreamed of being a country doctor\u2019s wife. It wasn\u2019t as if Dr. Hatfield lived in a hovel. He had pointed out his house to her, and it was a perfectly respectable house in the middle of the village, with a picket fence and likely a garden in back.</p><p>If they were married, he would help her with the accounts. True, he\u2019d said she would never learn to read, but he didn\u2019t make it seem like a criticism; his words didn\u2019t lash her the way the various tutors her father had hired had done.</p><p>No one ever understood that she had spent hours and hours trying to memorize letters that twisted into little dragons and leapt off the page, or slid sideways as if water had suddenly drenched the ink. No amount of staring or repetition would stop them from moving.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t do something, you will lose Mr. Dautry,\u201d her mother remarked, from the bed.</p><p>Lala started.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice was rising, which was never a good sign. \u201cMy maid has told me everything that\u2019s going on in this house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did hear you, Mama,\u201d Lala said. \u201cYou are concerned that Mr. Dautry is no longer interested in me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bring herself to point out that a few days ago her mother had been appalled at the very idea.</p><p>The problem was that Mr. Dautry was a terrifying man. The idea of marrying him made her shudder, though she was not afraid that he would say cruel things to her. He was frighteningly large, overly masculine\u2014but not cruel. He might feel silent scorn for her, but he would never speak the words aloud.</p><p>\u201cI think that Mr. Dautry and I are forming an acquaintanceship,\u201d she said lamely.</p><p>\u201cApparently the servants think that Dautry is tupping that hopeless excuse for a lady, Xenobia St. Clair,\u201d her mother replied acidly.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Sometimes her mother was the perfect embodiment of a royal lady-in-waiting, and one could not imagine a vulgarity crossing her lips. And sometimes . . . she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Lala. You\u2019re not a child in the schoolroom any longer. Even in the short period I was downstairs I saw the way his eyes followed her across the room. And Brody\u2019s as well. She\u2019s had Dautry, mark my words. No man looks at a woman that way unless he\u2019s known her between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama, you mustn\u2019t,\u201d Lala cried. \u201cDon\u2019t say these things. Lady Xenobia is all that is good and kind. I know that she supports Mr. Dautry\u2019s courtship of me. She as much as told me so!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s playing a sly game. She doesn\u2019t want the bastard, of course. She can do better, and she\u2019s going for the duke. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she were sleeping with both of them.\u201d</p><p>Lala gasped.</p><p>\u201cAt the same time,\u201d her mother added.</p><p>There are times in a woman\u2019s life when she has to make a stand. But years of feeling stupid and fearful crowded in on Lala, and she couldn\u2019t think of anything to say that would have an effect. Her mother wasn\u2019t even looking at her; she was propped up in her bed, looking at her face in a small hand mirror.</p><p>Without a word, Lala got up and left the room, closing the door precisely behind her. She went downstairs and asked Fleming for her pelisse. \u201cI shall accompany Dr. Hatfield on his rounds,\u201d she told him. \u201cI would like a carriage brought around immediately.\u201d</p><p>Lala never said imperious things like that. Never.</p><p>She did not permit herself to cry in the carriage on the way to the village, and when she reached the doctor\u2019s house, she stepped out and waved the carriage away, even though the groom wanted to approach the house for her.</p><p>Her heart was pounding. He had to be home.</p><p>He was not home.</p><p>A harassed-looking maid opened the door, and almost screamed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the doctor can\u2019t help right now, miss. He\u2019s gone out on a birthing, and the waiting room\u2019s full.\u201d Lala heard a cacophony coming from the room just off the entryway, a baby wailing and people barking at each other.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there. Still, he would have to return at some point, and she had nowhere else to go but Starberry Court\u2014and she did not want to do that. Besides, without a carriage, she had no way to return until the doctor appeared.</p><p>She walked past the maid into the entry, and took off her pelisse. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSarah,\u201d the maid said, taking Lala\u2019s pelisse. \u201cBut, miss, really, unless it\u2019s an emergency, you mustn\u2019t wait. The doctor\u2019s been out all night, and I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be back. It wouldn\u2019t be proper for you to be in there with the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall see if I can help,\u201d Lala said briskly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea?\u201d Sarah was clearly at the end of her rope.</p><p>Lala opened the door to the waiting room and took a quick glance. Then she said, \u201cPlease bring some hot water, Sarah, and some cotton bandaging. Let\u2019s see if we can get that boy\u2019s knee cleaned up before the doctor returns.\u201d</p><p>Dr. John Hatfield was weary to his very marrow. He\u2019d been up all night and had nearly lost the child. Even now, he wasn\u2019t sure the infant would survive.</p><p>His house would be erupting with patients, as it always was on a Sunday. The poor of West Drayton waited as long as they possibly could to see a doctor; when they had their half day, they skipped church and the public house, and came to him instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He really should hire an assistant. He\u2019d tried twice, with men just completing their medical training at St. Bartholomew\u2019s, but they never stayed long. They learned what they could from him, and then left for London or Bath, where people could actually afford to pay for a doctor\u2019s care.</p><p>The worst of it was that since his visit to Starberry Court the night before he couldn\u2019t stop thinking\u2014for the first time in his life\u2014that perhaps he should go to London. But each time, the thought was met by scornful reality: proximity wouldn\u2019t bring him any closer to Miss Laetitia Rainsford.</p><p>The distance between them was insurmountable. And the fact that he saw a look in her eyes that echoed the longing in his heart . . . that was irrelevant. A woman like her\u2014astonishingly beautiful, intelligent, with luscious curves, the daughter of a lady (no matter how much of a harridan that lady might be)\u2014wasn\u2019t for him.</p><p>He was disheveled and exhausted, and he still faced a waiting room full of patients who would run the gamut from merely irritable to dangerously ill.</p> <p>Sarah was nowhere to be seen when he stepped into the entry although, to his great surprise, he heard none of the usual crying or cursing coming from his waiting room. First he would see which patients were desperately in need of help. After that, he\u2019d try to find something to eat, because he\u2019d had nothing since four o\u2019clock the previous afternoon.</p><p>He braced himself for whatever he might find on the other side of the waiting room door, pushed it open, and stopped short.</p><p>She was there.</p><p>His patients were arrayed around the room, sipping tea as if they were at a party\u2014well, all except that small boy with flushed cheeks, who definitely had a high fever. And she looked across at him with a smile that sent a bolt of lust all the way to his knees.</p><p>John wasn\u2019t a man who lost control of his loins . . . and yet he was abruptly glad that his coat was cut unfashionably low. Miss Laetitia Rainsford was so damned beautiful.</p> <p>Walking gracefully toward him, she counted off the patients on her fingers, described their conditions, and explained that there were no urgent cases. There was nothing he had to do this very moment, and therefore he should restore himself before attending to them. He glanced around and saw all the patients nodding at him. Miss Rainsford had bound up an arm and put a patch on an elderly man\u2019s forehead.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t said a word, and an uncertain look crossed her face. \u201cCook has a hot meal waiting for you,\u201d she said, sounding a bit hesitant.</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>He did the only thing he could, given the burst of feeling that spilled through his entire body. He caught her in his arms, and kissed her so hard that she bent over his arm.</p><p>But her arms wrapped around his neck, and she kissed him back.</p><p>He was dimly aware of cheering, but Dr. John Daniel Hatfield didn\u2019t give a damn.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Lady Rainsford descended from her bedchamber just in time for luncheon, which was enough to make India want to flee home to London. She hadn\u2019t realized how profoundly disagreeable the woman was until she discovered that Lady Rainsford\u2019s voice dominated whatever room she was in. Before the meal she talked on and on about the way society was degenerating into (if you listened to her) little better than a pack of wolves.</p><p>Fleming announced that Lala was confined to her chamber with a severe headache; all India could think was that if Lady Rainsford had been her mother, she would probably develop chronic migraines.</p><p>Luncheon was given over to a lecture on the medieval practices of royal ladies-in-waiting. All of which was meant to ensure that the entire party was made aware that Lady Rainsford had married beneath her.</p><p>At least, that would be India\u2019s summation.</p><p>\u201cI cannot approve of the way Lady Rainsford talks about her own daughter,\u201d Adelaide said to India after everyone else had escaped the table, leaving the two of them. They had all fled back to the drawing room except Thorn, who had taken himself off somewhere, and Lala, who had missed the meal.</p><p>Lady Rainsford had made a point of instructing Fleming not to bring her daughter a plate in her room, saying with a laugh that Lala\u2019s hips were large enough.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand her,\u201d India said fiercely. \u201cMy mother wasn\u2019t perfect when it came to nurturing, Adelaide, but at least she never tried to eat her young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Lala wasn\u2019t even in the room to defend herself, and her mother as good as told us that she was eating them out of house and home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely unkind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she said that Mrs. Peters, who everyone knows is grieving the death of her little girl, was being maudlin merely because she wears black and wept on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was not compassionate,\u201d Adelaide agreed. \u201cI also do not like the way that she looks at you, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s decided that I\u2019m a hussy,\u201d India said, not caring at all. Lady Rainsford was right. She\u2019d done naughty things\u2014in a hammock, and in a gatehouse. But rather than being shamed, she felt proud of herself.</p><p>\u201cI shall have to have a word with her,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cShe has single-handedly ruined several reputations, and I\u2019m quite sure she\u2019s noticed that Thorn is in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is, darling. As is Lord Brody. Poor Lala doesn\u2019t stand a chance, which may be behind her mother\u2019s irritation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are entirely mistaken,\u201d India told her. \u201cThorn has every intention of marrying Lala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReluctantly, I have to agree. I had no idea that Lala was in such desperate straits at home,\u201d Adelaide said. \u201cI know Mr. Dautry prides himself on his lack of gentlemanly characteristics. But in fact, I would judge him one of the most gentlemanly men I\u2019ve had the pleasure to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherefore, he will marry Lala, because it is the most honorable thing to do. And you, my dear, will be very happy with Lord Brody.\u201d</p><p>India swallowed hard. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect that Lala and Thorn will not be as happy together. Yet I worry not about them, but about you. This situation is why society puts strictures on people\u2019s behavior.\u201d</p><p>Her godmother drew India to a halt. Everyone had entered the drawing room before them, and the corridor was empty. \u201cA woman gives away her heart along with her virtue,\u201d Adelaide said softly. \u201cA man does not. Society\u2019s strictures protect women\u2019s hearts as well as their reputations.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, India\u2019s fluffy, affectionate godmother grasped a good deal more than she let on. With a kiss Adelaide disappeared into the drawing room, leaving India staring at the wall.</p><p>Surely Adelaide was wrong about Thorn\u2019s marriage to Lala. His childhood had been awful, and he needed sweetness in his life. It wasn\u2019t as if India could give that to him herself. She didn\u2019t have a kind, forgiving nature like Lala\u2019s\u2014obviously, since she was still furious at her parents for their neglect and abandonment.</p><p>And yet she wanted Thorn to choose her, rather than Lala. It wasn\u2019t just his body, or the way they made love. It was the brilliant way he invented things such as the India rubber band, merely because he had bought an ailing factory and needed to save the jobs of twenty-six men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was even the way he had seen who Lala was, when the rest of them\u2014the whole ton\u2014had ignored her. He\u2019d realized that Lala was bright, and that she needed rescuing.</p><p>India couldn\u2019t even put into words the way he was with Rose. It was as if he\u2019d walked straight into being Rose\u2019s father, and the little girl would never know how lucky she was to have had two fathers who loved her, protected her, and treasured her.</p><p>India almost groaned aloud. Adelaide was right. She had forgotten to guard her heart.</p><p>It seemed she\u2019d given it away, without noticing.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>That evening at dinner, Vander lavished attention on India, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care. She felt listless, as if the world was hurtling on without her. Probably she\u2019d end up married to Vander. And Thorn would marry Lala.</p><p>Obviously, he hadn\u2019t spent the afternoon at his factory, not given the way Lala looked. He must have spent the afternoon with her, and never mind the fact that she was supposedly confined to her room with a headache.</p><p>Right now Lala was sitting at the dining table, rosy and glowing . . . Did she really think that they wouldn\u2019t notice the love bite on her neck? Lala had tucked a fichu into the bodice of her gown, but India wasn\u2019t stupid. She could recognize a woman who had spent the afternoon kissing.</p><p>Or more.</p> <p>The worst was that India felt like such a light-skirt, as Adelaide would call it. A slut, to use a baser term. Thorn had spent the afternoon seducing another woman, and she still wanted him.</p><p>Luckily, this evening he wasn\u2019t seated beside her; he was at the head of the table, and she was quite a bit farther down. So far away that she dared to look at him under her lashes.</p><p>She kept meeting his eyes, which was embarrassing. But every time, a stab of lust would go through her and she would shift in her chair, her legs restless. Mortifyingly, he caught her doing it. He knew what she was feeling.</p><p>Once he actually laughed aloud after their eyes met, which made her mind reel.</p><p>Men were incredible. How could he look at her in that way, after spending the afternoon with Lala? You only had to look at her to know that she was in a happy daze, that she felt loved and appreciated.</p><p>India narrowed her eyes at him and then looked to her right, at Vander.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sparring with Thorn?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d India said, taking a swallow of wine. \u201cThough if I could, I would spar with him for having disappeared for hours. It\u2019s hardly the conduct of a good host.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes rested thoughtfully on Lala, and India\u2019s stomach pitched. Of course everyone guessed where their host had been, or at least, what he had been doing.</p><p>\u201cI believe we may be thinking the same thing,\u201d she said, summoning a smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect Thorn has asked Lala to be his wife,\u201d she breathed. \u201cJust look at her.\u201d Lala was absentmindedly lining up her silverware, a little smile playing around her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced,\u201d Vander said, his eyes going to Thorn.</p><p>\u201cShe has a mark on her neck.\u201d</p> <p>Vander looked back at India, one side of his mouth quirked up, and she felt herself blushing. She probably shouldn\u2019t even know about love bites. \u201cShe does look happy,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>Lord Brody was handsome. And he wasn\u2019t baseborn either, though she didn\u2019t give a damn about that. Still, other people did. If her parents were still alive, and if they had cared about such things, they would have preferred she marry Vander.</p><p>He even smelled good, like wind with a touch of rain, probably because he spent most of his time on a horse.</p><p>She made up her mind. She would not humiliate herself by making calf\u2019s eyes at a man who was marrying another woman. Vander was handsome and strong and perfect. She smiled at him. The big smile, the one that Thorn hated.</p><p>Vander didn\u2019t hate it. He smiled back, and his eyes crinkled at the corners in an entirely attractive way. India reached out blindly, picked up her wineglass again, and began to ask Vander about his stables.</p><p>She did not look again at the end of the table. She kept her shoulder turned, as a matter of fact. She held on to her dignity with all the strength she had, and she lavished smiles on Vander.</p><p>He was her future, and Lala was Thorn\u2019s future, and that was that.</p><p>When Eleanor rose, all the ladies rose with her, and the room hummed with quiet chatter and the swish of gowns brushing the marble floor. \u201cThe ladies will join me for tea in the small drawing room,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>India had designed it for precisely this purpose. It was a beautiful, feminine space, with clusters of settees and even a game table in the event that someone wanted to play piquet.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d Eleanor said cheerfully, taking Adelaide\u2019s arm and ignoring the way Lady Rainsford was hovering, indicating that she would like to stroll beside the duchess.</p><p>India stopped to have a chat with Fleming, who revealed that there hadn\u2019t been quite enough soup spoons, and that the second downstairs maid had tripped on the back stairs and sprained her ankle.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bit clumsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll improve,\u201d India said.</p><p>Thorn appeared at Fleming\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cWhat in the hell are the two of you discussing?\u201d</p><p>Just like that, India\u2019s heart sped up and began beating loudly in her ears. He was cross again, but that wasn\u2019t what made her pulse race; it was the pure maleness that blazed out of him, even standing as he was in the shadowy corridor, half hidden by his butler.</p><p>\u201cMerely an insufficiency of soup spoons,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, Fleming.\u201d</p><p>The butler bowed, giving Thorn a sharp-eyed glance. India wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he knew everything. Butlers always did.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about my soup spoons,\u201d Thorn said, taking a step closer. His jaw was set, and his eyes were saying something . . . she wasn\u2019t quite sure what.</p><p>India was transfixed by his closeness, and it took a moment for his comment to sink in. Of course, she didn\u2019t. He had a wife now. Or as good as one.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, head high. \u201cI will give Lala the direction of the silversmith who created your design.\u201d</p><p>He made a growling sound. \u201cLeave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I\u2019ll be joining the ladies.\u201d And she nodded toward the door to the small drawing room.</p><p>But instead of allowing her to pass, Thorn took another step toward her. India reflexively stepped backward, only to discover that he had herded her into a tiny room off the corridor designed to hold footmen\u2019s livery.</p><p>Proper cabinetry had yet to be fitted, and as a temporary measure, India had concealed the alcove with a misty gray hanging. Now the curtain fell closed behind Thorn as he gently pushed her all the way into the tiny room.</p><p>There was scarcely room for both of them, and light filtered dimly through the loose linen weave. She looked up at his scowling eyes and something broke open inside her heart, just a little bit.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen in love with a man with cool gray eyes, the very same color as the fabric at his shoulder. She had created the perfect setting for him without even knowing she was doing it.</p><p>\u201cThorn,\u201d she said, \u201cI must join the other ladies; they will be wondering what became of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stopped looking at me,\u201d he said, frowning at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had no reason to look at your end of the table.\u201d</p><p>He braced one arm on the wall above her head, leaning closer. \u201cYou looked at me earlier.\u201d He sounded as if he were speaking through clenched teeth.</p><p>It was embarrassing to find that the merest glance at his lips made her knees feel weak. But she managed to summon up her self-respect. \u201cYou should be spending time with Lala. Go!\u201d</p><p>He paid no attention. \u201cDo you know that most people find me intimidating?\u201d</p> <p>Meeting his eyes made India drag in a deep breath and begin to turn sideways, to dart toward freedom. But his body closed in, and his mouth came down on hers. Their kiss was deep and wet\u2014not sweet, but scorching, as if there was no air in the world other than what she took from Thorn\u2019s lips.</p><p>It was silent, this desperate kiss, so insistent that she could actually feel her lips becoming bee-stung. His hand shoved into her hair, and the pins that had held in place a pyramid of elaborate ringlets tinkled to the floor.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped. But his mouth found hers again. She hardly registered that she had launched herself away from the wall, and she was now plastered against him, as close as if she were trying to melt into him.</p><p>In fact, she didn\u2019t notice at first when his hands slipped under her skirts. Not until she realized that they were cupping her bottom, hitching her higher and backing her against the wall again. Her legs instinctively curled around his hips as he pushed his pelvis against her, sending flames arcing down her legs.</p><p>She said something in a shamefully weak voice. It might have been \u201cNo.\u201d But even worse, it might have been \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever it was, he ignored her. His fingers slipped into the silky tuft of hair between her legs. The moment he touched her, her lips opened in a cry that he caught with his mouth.</p><p>His kiss and caress tumbled her into a haze: her head spun and she couldn\u2019t see or even breathe. She clung to him, his clever, clever fingers igniting a fever in her blood. Need rose in her like a dark storm.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she whispered hoarsely, pulling away from his kiss. \u201cYou cannot spend the afternoon with Lala and then come to me. You cannot seduce me while you\u2019re betrothed to another.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes, his face strained with desire but confused. \u201cI am not betrothed to anyone. I have said nothing about marriage to Lala or any other woman.\u201d</p><p>India stared at him. It was hard to think when her body was shaking. His fingers had stilled, but they were still there, touching her. \u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re not betrothed? Even informally?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. His eyes had darkened to the color of a storm over the sea, and his fingers started that caress again, touching her in a teasingly regular pattern that made her body oddly lax and tense all at once.</p> <p>As if she was waiting . . . waiting for something.</p><p>\u201cI have spoken to Lala\u2019s father, but given the circumstances of my birth, he declined to consider the matter unless I received Lady Rainsford\u2019s approval. I never asked Lala for her hand.\u201d The words grated from his throat, and India believed him. Whose fault was it that Lala was dreaming about marriage to Thorn? Probably every other woman in London was dreaming about Thorn.</p><p>The thought drifted away, because Thorn lifted her with one arm\u2014her weight seemingly nothing\u2014and unbuttoned his breeches with the other, pulling himself free. She gasped when their bodies came together again, her thighs instinctively tightening around his hips.</p><p>\u201cI did not spend the afternoon with Lala,\u201d he growled at her, his voice jolting, as if he were in a runaway carriage. \u201cI was at the rubber factory, trying to make that damn machine work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d India breathed as he nudged her softest, most private spot.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he growled, his eyes holding hers. Her arms tightened around his neck. She could no more say no to him than she could tell the sun not to rise. She wiggled against him at the very same moment he drove into her.</p><p>She would have screamed but his mouth covered hers again, a frantic kiss in time with the rhythm of his rough thrusting. Wild pleasure flared in her limbs as he kept going and going, an arm around her back to protect her from the wall.</p><p>They were both mad, India thought dimly, not really thinking, just feeling: the strength of his arm holding her up, the way they were connected, and the powerful way he was pumping into her, as if she were life.</p> <p>And then . . .</p><p>And then she was coming, her head falling backward, her body jerking as if she were falling into a well full of stars, a deep one. The stars flew out to the very end of her fingers. It was so pleasurable that it was almost painful. And it kept going and going.</p><p>Thorn groaned, braced himself against the wall and\u2014</p><p>It was different. It felt different. He was deep inside her, his breath rasping, his hips pumping. His breath was harsh and his control lost.</p><p>He was like a man starving, a man possessed. And with that thought, she was coming again, succumbing to the rhythm of his hips . . . the rhythm of his heart.</p><p>A moment later, India\u2019s breath was still sobbing from her chest; he still had an arm around her bottom. But he was leaning his head against the wall, gulping air. They stood together in silence, her body blissful and her mind blank.</p><p>At length, reason returned, bringing abject terror with it.</p><p>\u201cThorn, you didn\u2019t use a sheath,\u201d India whispered. \u201cYou forgot!\u201d</p><p>She heard a sharp inhalation, and then his response, a word she\u2019d never heard before. But she knew what it meant. It meant he dropped her to the floor as fast as a child might drop a cat. Unlike a cat, she landed wrong, lurching on one of her elegant little Italian heels, and managing to stay upright only by grabbing his sleeve.</p><p>He didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>She knew what he was thinking. Now she would force him to marry her. Trap him, and keep him away from sweet, dizzy Lala. She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI have never lost control before,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain everything is fine!\u201d she said, chirping like Adelaide. \u201cMy mother tried for years to have another child and never succeeded.\u201d She let go of his sleeve and shook down her skirts, ignoring the fact that her legs were throbbing.</p><p>\u201cMy father has six bastard children,\u201d he stated. \u201cIf my father had married your mother, you\u2019d probably have seventeen brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cMay I remind you that Eleanor has borne only one child? I am aware that you have strong feelings on this subject, but I can reassure you that all will be well. Adelaide told me . . . well, conception has to do with the time of the month, and rest assured, you are not going to be a father.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, his mouth tight.</p><p>Humiliation was welling up inside, and if it made its way out, India would likely burst into tears.</p><p>It was one thing to have a romantic affaire, a sweet memory of a single night\u2019s bliss. But Thorn hadn\u2019t even brought her to a bedchamber, but had simply shoved her behind a curtain and pulled up her skirts, as if she were no more than a night-walker.</p><p>The worst of it was that she\u2019d liked it. She had practically begged him to do it, even knowing that he was marrying another woman. And that Lala was dreaming of their marriage.</p><p>She\u2019d done that to herself, betrayed her own standards. Self-hatred crept up the back of India\u2019s throat like acid.</p><p>She had always scorned her parents, but they had never done anything like this. They had danced naked but their intentions were pure, even if the villagers had never understood. Her mother and father had truly believed in Diana, the moon goddess. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They hadn\u2019t engaged in a sordid affair, thrown up against a wall when any servant might walk by. They respected each other; no, they adored each other. They might have been eccentric, but they were married.</p><p>For the first time in her life, she had behaved in a way that shamed her parents, rather than the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. At least she had the tears under control.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d Thorn said, his voice a low rumble.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot! Anyone might walk down this corridor at any moment!\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met, and she saw as he grasped her unspoken point: her lips were swollen, her hair down her back . . . she even smelled like the two of them. \u201cI am going to my room,\u201d she stated, \u201cand this did not happen. It will never happen again.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her arm from his grip, threw open the curtain, and ran toward the back staircase as quickly as she could. When she made it to her bedchamber without being caught, she had the impulse to send up a thankful prayer to the goddess Diana.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p> <p>Thorn felt as if a bolt of lightning had struck a crowded street and he was the only one in its path. Sensation rushed through him: strong, sharp, biting.</p><p>What in the hell was happening to him? Had he truly lost his mind? After India began ignoring him during dinner, there was no further point to the meal. He kept glancing at her, but she turned her shoulder to him, laughing and talking with Vander.</p><p>He had been closer than he wanted to admit to dragging her out from the room, carrying her straight to his bedchamber, and losing himself in her. Only his tight control had kept him in his chair.</p><p>But after dinner, when he\u2019d seen India talking to Fleming, he hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself. He\u2019d treated her as if she were no more than a trull, a woman taken wordlessly by a ruffian who tossed her a sovereign afterwards. Took, moreover, without using a sheath or giving a thought to the consequences.</p><p>Naturally she had looked at him with betrayal starkly written on her face. The first time they\u2019d made love, he had promised that she would never face the possibility of carrying a child out of wedlock.</p><p>Now he slumped against the wall, a string of curses running through his mind. He would marry her; that went without saying.</p> <p>But he couldn\u2019t get over the fact that he had neglected to use protection. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to him. Even though it was an unshakable tenet of his adult life that Thorn Dautry never bedded a woman without using a French letter.</p><p>Finally he tucked in his shirt, buttoned his breeches, and went to find Fleming. He needed to obtain a special license.</p><p>Fleming\u2019s bushy eyebrows flew up when Thorn told him to send Fred to Doctors\u2019 Commons in order to request a special license from the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p><p>\u201cI believe the fee for a special license is five pounds,\u201d the butler said, taking the twenty-pound note Thorn handed him.</p><p>\u201cThe archbishop will have to leave the license blank, since I am not there in person,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cThe clergy do not like to do that, by all accounts. Twenty pounds should be sufficient persuasion, proffered as a donation to the poor, of course. Make sure Fred understands that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Fleming said, bowing. \u201cFredrick is most reliable. I shall send him straight away.\u201d</p><p>Thorn nodded and glanced over his butler\u2019s shoulder, only to meet his father\u2019s fascinated eyes. \u201cA special license?\u201d His Grace drawled. \u201cAnd I thought my eldest son was lamentably conservative. I pictured you in Westminster Abbey. I suppose I should be grateful that you are not contemplating Gretna Green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cathedral would never allow me through its doors,\u201d Thorn said.</p> <p>\u201cThey damned well would take you,\u201d the duke stated, his eyes darkening.</p><p>Thorn hadn\u2019t the energy to discuss the consequences of illegitimacy with his father. He had to find India and inform her that they would marry as soon as the next day. Wasn\u2019t there some rule that nuptials had to be conducted before noon? They could marry the day after tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cMay I inquire as to the name of the bride?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>Thorn met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>A satisfied smile played around his father\u2019s lips. \u201cI suspect that I do.\u201d He fell back a step and swept one of his magnificent bows. \u201cSon. You do me proud.\u201d</p><p>Thorn made one of his own perfunctory bows in reply.</p><p>Then he retired to his room, brooding over the fact that a blindingly foolish slip would result in marriage to India.</p><p>Which meant, in turn, living with India every day, coming home to the amazing hunger that matched his own. The thought sent fire searing through him. India\u2019s sweet arse beside him in bed, India\u2019s blue eyes glazed with desire, begging him for relief, India\u2019s intoxicating moans.</p><p>He scarcely touched her, and she was already wet. You couldn\u2019t fake that. A woman could fake many things, but not that.</p><p>And he trusted her, as much as he\u2019d trust anyone. He even liked her.</p><p>She was almost like a man, though her mind worked in fascinatingly different ways from his. India rubber bands were going to be an enormous success. He knew it in his bones, and he was never wrong about business.</p><p>After a bath, he dressed and walked down the long corridor to India\u2019s room. He entered without knocking and closed the door behind him.</p><p>She was curled in a chair reading a book, her face bent to the page. A wall lamp cast a glow over her shoulders, turning her hair to a river of white gold.</p><p>With just a glance, he began to harden again, even though he\u2019d just had her, barely an hour ago. Likely their whole life would be like that. He would spend years dragging his wife into corners, into the hammock, into their bedchamber.</p><p>He would never grow tired of making love to India. He knew it instinctively, with every fiber of his being. Once they married, her lush body would be his, his for the taking, for the asking, at any time. What\u2019s more, she would laugh and scold and argue with him.</p><p>Perhaps that was even more important.</p><p>Thorn stood in the doorway, struggling to control the emotions raging through him, when India said, without looking up from her book, \u201cI\u2019d much prefer that you didn\u2019t walk into my bedchamber without invitation. And I have no intention of extending that invitation.\u201d</p><p>She was angry. Of course she was. He had explicitly promised that he would never put her at risk of bearing a child. He still didn\u2019t believe it had happened. At the same time, all he wanted to do was pull her nightdress from her body, sweep her onto the bed, and thrust inside her.</p><p>Without a sheath.</p><p>He had spent his youth learning the intricacies of pleasuring a woman from an assortment of females. He had been with many women, more than he cared to remember, knowing that someday he would bind his wife to him with his lovemaking, satisfying her in ways that would ensure she never left him.</p><p>Or, more to the point, never left their children.</p><p>With India, everything he had learned about slowly bringing a woman to pleasure flew out the window and all he could think of was\u2014one thing.</p><p>\u201cA husband needs no invitation to enter his wife\u2019s bedchamber,\u201d he said, his voice coming out husky and rough. Surely she too understood that they now must marry.</p><p>\u201cWhat a husband does or doesn\u2019t need is debatable, but it hardly matters in this instance, as you are not my husband,\u201d she said, turning the page. She finally looked up at him. \u201cIn case you are wondering, Thorn, you will never be my husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cConsidering the fact that I had you against the wall a mere hour ago, you are quite likely carrying my child,\u201d he replied, knowing that his voice had dropped an octave.</p><p>Another woman would have winced or been embarrassed. He could have sworn he saw yearning flash through her eyes. But then it was gone; he must have imagined it.</p><p>India\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cI am not carrying your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But I can be reasonably certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no certainty in these things. I have sent for a special license, and we will be married on the morrow or, at the latest, the day after.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, apparently shocked. Did she think that he would simply saunter away after that?</p><p>Finally she put that damned book to the side and came to her feet. \u201cThorn, I will not marry a man due to a momentary foolishness. You are essentially promised to Lala. You have spoken to her father, whether he declined to answer or no. She is dreaming of your future life together. The fact that I acted like a whore does not compel you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>He was frozen for a moment, then he found himself standing before her, hands on her shoulders, giving her a gentle shake. \u201cDo not ever say something like that about yourself. You are nothing like a whore.\u201d</p> <p>India stared back at him, her eyes flat. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true that I didn\u2019t charge you for my services. But I don\u2019t think that Lady Rainsford will care about that distinction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Rainsford is a monstrous woman,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cShe is your future mother-in-law,\u201d India observed. \u201cOur unfortunate behavior does not and should not compel you to marry me\u2014and neither does it mean that I am compelled to marry you. You appear to have forgotten to propose, but you needn\u2019t bother. My answer is no.\u201d</p><p>Thorn felt astonishment roaring down his spine. \u201cYour answer is yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not think for a second that you can force me into marriage!\u201d</p><p>India turned blindly away from Thorn\u2019s black expression and walked to the mantel. The truth could not be avoided. He deserved better than she, someone sweet and soft. She swallowed hard.</p> <p>And she deserved someone who loved her, not someone forced by his sense of honor to marry her. Tears threatened again, but she managed to choke them down.</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d Thorn said from behind her, the bite in his voice easing.</p><p>She had to cut him off before he persuaded her, because it would only be his conscience talking. She refused to be sacrificed on the altar of any man\u2019s conscience.</p><p>Not when it would change the course of her whole life. Not . . . not loving him the way she loved him, especially if he grew to hate her because he lost his \u201cideal\u201d wife.</p><p>He would hate her, if not now, then later, after the pleasure of illicit encounters in hallways had worn off. She would rather die than live that way.</p><p>\u201cAt any rate,\u201d she said, steeling her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind. I am not giving up my profession. I have decided to accept an offer from the Prince of Wales; I shall renovate his private quarters at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou will not go anywhere near that fat lecher\u2019s chambers.\u201d</p><p>She gripped the mantelpiece, using it to keep herself upright as she turned to face him again. \u201cI shall go where I wish. And I would be daft not to accept the job. Perhaps after that, I shall marry\u2014but never because of a moment\u2019s indiscretion. My parents were neglectful, as you know. But they loved each other. I didn\u2019t realize until recently how important that was, and I shall certainly not marry a man who doesn\u2019t even think he has to propose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would have proposed.\u201d It looked as if his lips were scarcely moving.</p><p>\u201cWhen? After we were married? You walked into this room and informed me that you had sent for a special license. Acceptance on my part had nothing to do with it. You felt that there was no reason to ask me, because our marriage wouldn\u2019t have been about us. It would be about the possibility of a child.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny it. She hated that his tacit agreement hurt.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thorn was staring at the carpet, but after a moment, he looked up, his eyes burning with frustration. \u201cYou will not defy me in this, India. Our irresponsible actions have left us with no alternative. Regardless of what you say, you cannot deny the possibility that we conceived a child.\u201d</p><p>That, more than anything, demonstrated that he didn\u2019t love her. To him, she was no more than a woman who engaged in irresponsible behavior. A sob nearly forced itself from her throat before she choked it back.</p><p>There was only one thing that would stop Thorn from marrying her, she knew. She would have to say it. That horrible thing.</p><p>\u201cYou are doing this because of the possibility of a child. As I have told you, I am quite certain that there is no child. But if there is\u201d\u2014She hesitated, her heart beating so hard that she felt faint.\u2014\u201cI will do as your mother did.\u201d</p><p>She saw the blood drain from his face. \u201cAre you saying that you will leave the child to me, just as my mother left me with my father?\u201d he asked incredulously.</p><p>She nodded jerkily, uncertain whether her expression betrayed the truth of how utterly an action like that would destroy her. Surely he wouldn\u2019t believe her capable of that.</p><p>But no, she could read condemnation in his face. He knew her no better than did Lord Dibbleshire. Like his lordship, Thorn accepted whatever she said.</p><p>He would hate her now, she understood that. But it had to be.</p><p>\u201cI am sure that you will be an excellent father,\u201d she said, forcing the words out of her mouth. \u201cRose adores you.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s gaze burned into her. \u201cYou love Rose, although you\u2019ve met her only a few times. You would never leave a child, your own child. You are lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you that I am not.\u201d She almost turned away again, but she straightened her backbone instead. \u201cYou do not know me, Thorn, nor do you love me,\u201d she said, letting go of the mantel and standing tall, hating that she had to swim in such selfish, shallow waters to accomplish what had to be done. \u201cI have earned the right to marry someone who loves me. I deserve a man who treasures me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI treasure you!\u201d His voice was sharp.</p><p>Like a flash fire in a poorly run kitchen, fury and anger and utter despair raced through her. \u201cYou made love to me without protection! You made love to me virtually in front of the woman you plan to marry, and where any servant might have happened by. You do not treasure me!\u201d There was a moment\u2019s silence while she pulled her crumbling self together again. \u201cIt is not entirely your fault. I have repeatedly made stupid choices.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I really seem experienced to you?\u201d She whispered those words because they were burning in the back of her throat. \u201cDid I truly?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, and she saw his throat ripple. \u201cYou were a virgin?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cThere was no blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bled for two days after the first time I rode a horse without a saddle. I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me?\u201d</p><p>She felt her mouth curl into an ironic smile. \u201cI wanted you. And you would not have . . . have taken me if you thought me experienced, would you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His silence was the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d she continued steadily, \u201cI wanted you enough to lie to you. But I would like to marry someone who knows me. Who loves me. A man who does not barge into my room and make demands of me or, for that matter, tup me against the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll take Vander?\u201d His voice was a growl, but his eyes were direct.</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants you! That\u2019s not the same as loving you.\u201d</p><p>She had to swallow and clench her teeth in order to keep from crying. She nodded. \u201cI know that. After all, you and I wanted each other. And look where that got me. Please leave, Thorn.\u201d</p><p>Her throat closed, and she really couldn\u2019t say anything else. It was just as well that he dragged his hand through his hair, raked her with another furious glance, and left without a word.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Thorn avoided India the following day by spending most of it working in his library; he even took luncheon there. \u201cWorking\u201d was not precisely accurate: he kept losing himself in thought, staring blindly at the desk as ink blotted whatever letter he was trying to write.</p><p>He could scarcely believe India\u2019s claim that she would give up her child. And yet, every time he decided it had to be a lie, her greatest lie . . . his common sense, his reason, his understanding of the world, sent him reeling back the other direction, toward believing that she told the truth.</p><p>India was evidently a version of his mother: a woman who sampled erotic pleasures and moved on, leaving a child behind in the dust caused by her departure. Like India, she\u2019d had a profession that defined her. That she loved. They were both brilliant, creative women who put their professions before their personal lives.</p><p>And yet . . .</p><p>He thought of the conversation during which India had told him of her parents\u2019 leaving for London. The way she had wept on his shoulder, her shuddering sobs telling him that she\u2019d never revealed that pain before.</p> <p>Thorn knew how it felt to be abandoned, whether unthinkingly, as his father had done to him, or selfishly, as his mother had. A woman marked by that pain would never\u2014could never\u2014give away her baby.</p><p>He simply did not believe it. By the time the afternoon was drawing to a close, he was convinced India had lied to him. He had gone over every minute, every second of the time they\u2019d spent together, reviewed every word they\u2019d exchanged, her every glance.</p><p>And he\u2019d thought through their conversation of the night before. She believed he wanted to marry her only because of the child they might have conceived. Perhaps she truly believed that he would be happier married to Lala. Certainly, she felt guilty because Lala was wandering around looking like a dazed lamb in love.</p><p>He supposed that if he were a gentleman, he would feel guilty too. But he wasn\u2019t and he didn\u2019t. He had never promised a damned thing to Laetitia Rainsford. In fact, they had never even spoken in private, other than two encounters in Kensington Gardens, and a carriage ride. Every time he came close to her, she shied away.</p><p>Even if he hadn\u2019t met India, he would have been reconsidering that union, because Lala\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t merely unpleasant; she was loathsome. He didn\u2019t want his children to have a grandmother like that. Besides, he was only one bawdy joke away from Lady Rainsford\u2019s rejection of his proposal.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t feel guilty. And if India felt guilty, she could find a different husband for Lala. Hell, he\u2019d be happy to supply a dowry. There was no question that India would be as talented at matchmaking as she was at organizing.</p><p>He went upstairs to bathe, still thinking hard. Being married to India would be like trying to harness a storm at sea. She was one of the few people in the world who had no fear of him, a woman who whipped around to face him, hands on hips, eyes narrowed, and told him exactly what she thought.</p><p>He grinned at the thought of it.</p> <p>\u201cCravat, sir?\u201d his valet offered. Thorn nodded. He might as well dress properly when asking a lady to marry him. She wanted a proper proposal; he could do that.</p><p>He planned to kiss her before uttering a word, though. If he merely touched her arm, a little shudder would go through her body. Her eyes would darken, and her tongue would touch her lips, preparing for him. And after he raised his mouth, she would cling to him, her eyes hazy.</p><p>If he kissed her before proposing, she wouldn\u2019t have the willpower to resist him.</p><p>With that thought, he glanced down and wrenched off the coat he had just put on. \u201cI\u2019ll wear the dark blue one instead,\u201d he told his valet. It was longer and would cover what needed to be covered. She wasn\u2019t the only one caught in a sea storm, after all. He only had to glance at her, or realize she was in a room, and his prick would rise. And stay up too.</p><p>She did something to him, something that eroded his control and turned him into a frenzied brute with one idea in mind. He quickly buttoned the longer coat before his valet could reach out to help.</p><p>There was a scratch on the door and his valet opened it. A footman held out a small silver tray. \u201cA letter for Mr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>Thorn held out his hand, recognizing India\u2019s handwriting. It was bold and delicate at the same time, ornate and yet easily legible. Very like India herself.</p><p>Dear Mr. Dautry,</p><p>I did not want to lose any time in informing you that the event about which we both felt concern has not come to pass. I trust you can find another use for the special license.</p><p>With all best wishes,</p><p>Lady Xenobia</p><p>He stared at the sheet for a moment before realizing that it didn\u2019t make a damned bit of difference. India wasn\u2019t pregnant this time, but she would be the next, or the time after that.</p><p>If he had to pull her into that alcove and take her again sans sheath, he would. In fact, he would do it without hesitation. Obviously, she was upset by his mutton-fisted proposal, and she\u2019d come up with a deception in order to put him off. He had to make it clear immediately that he saw through her ploy and wanted her for herself, not for the baby who didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair and walked from the room to look for her. She wasn\u2019t in her chamber, so he went downstairs.</p><p>She was in neither of the drawing rooms, nor in the ballroom, dining room, or breakfast room. Where the hell was she?</p><p>He was heading toward the servants\u2019 door to see if she was counting the soup spoons when he heard a raised voice outside the house, unmistakably the arrogant tenor of Lady Rainsford.</p><p>He followed the clamor to the front door, from which position he could see the lady in question standing in the drive, holding forth to an audience made up of Fleming, at the top of the steps, and his father, stepmother, and Vander at the bottom.</p><p>Just then his father shifted to one side, revealing two more characters in this little drama: India was there too, her face defiant, holding Rose tightly to her side.</p><p>\u201cI know evidence of depravity when I see it,\u201d Lady Rainsford was saying, her voice shriller than usual.</p><p>Damnation. He ran down the steps. Eleanor reached out and put a hand on his arm. \u201cStay calm,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>Lady Rainsford\u2019s raisin-sized eyes narrowed at his approach. \u201cThere he is! I suppose you hoped to conceal this child, Mr. Dautry? The evidence of your debased and corrupt nature!\u201d</p><p>India watched Thorn approach with an overwhelming sense of dread. She had dealt with every sort of household crisis; she had soothed women driven to hysterics by their husbands, servants, and children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it was all different when the tempest resulted from a decision she had made; after all, she had suggested Thorn keep Rose hidden away. The dower house had been her idea. She felt paralyzed, as if she had somehow found herself on a public stage without being told her lines.</p><p>\u201cYou invited me and my daughter here under a pretense!\u201d Lady Rainsford screeched. \u201cHad I not uncovered your shame, my daughter might have married you and been ruined\u2014utterly ruined. How long did you think to disguise the presence of your by-blow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not Rose\u2019s father,\u201d Thorn stated. The look in his eyes made India shiver.</p><p>Lady Rainsford seemed unaffected. \u201cPoppycock! She was tucked away in a separate house, just as my maid informed me this morning. I could scarcely believe it myself, but here she is. If this child of shame were truly your ward, there would be no need to conceal her existence. I think we can all agree to that!\u201d</p> <p>India felt another pulse of guilt; she should have guessed that Lady Rainsford would employ her maid as a spy. Then she felt Rose\u2019s thin shoulders trembling under her hands, and her guilt was replaced by outrage.</p><p>How dare the woman say such things in front of a child? She was despicable. She had to be silenced.</p><p>Lady Rainsford moved to a new target, the Duke of Villiers. \u201cAnd you! I suppose you were applauding your son\u2019s attempt to dupe those of us who take marriage vows seriously. Is Christian morality a mere jest to you, Your Grace?\u201d The last two words were not meant as a title of respect.</p><p>The duke didn\u2019t speak, but his expression was terrifying. He stepped forward, and India could tell that his intervention would only make the situation worse.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with Mr. Dautry,\u201d she cried, cutting off Villiers before he could reply or, worse, throw Lady Rainsford into the nearest hedge. The duke ignored her, moving forward like a predator.</p> <p>Lady Rainsford merely snorted, her eyes returning to the little girl trembling under India\u2019s fingers. \u201cShe\u2019s the image of her father, and I don\u2019t mean that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Utter fury ripped up India\u2019s spine. \u201cYou are a vile woman,\u201d she snapped, \u201cas are your disgraceful allegations. Rose is my daughter, and no concern of yours!\u201d</p><p>She scarcely believed that she had blurted out those words, even as they came from her mouth. But silence fell.</p><p>Blessedly, silence fell.</p><p>Lady Rainsford\u2019s expression was incredulous. \u201cShe is your child?\u201d</p><p>India drew a deep, stunned breath. There was no turning back now. \u201cYes,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cMine. You should cease your unpleasant insinuations, Lady Rainsford. Mr. Dautry is innocent of your charges.\u201d She pulled Rose even closer.</p> <p>\u201cI always knew you were no better than you should be!\u201d the lady said, her mouth twisting with distaste. \u201cPeople driveled on about how wonderful you were, but there were those of us who knew that only a light-skirt would accept money from a man. The way you moved from household to household, I wonder if you even know the father\u2019s name!\u201d</p><p>Her words struck with the bitterness of a poisoned dagger. In that instant, India grasped what her hasty remark would mean for herself, for her own reputation. Her heart dropped to her feet. Would she never learn to think before she spoke?</p><p>Thorn took a step toward Lady Rainsford, the rage in his eyes controlled but savage. \u201cI want you out of my house within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI surmise that you are indeed the father,\u201d the lady snapped, \u201csince you protect this fallen woman!\u201d</p><p>With one impulsive comment, India had destroyed years of guarding her reputation. Lady Rainsford would spread her malice across all London. Thank goodness, Adelaide had retired to her room for a rest. Not that it mattered.</p><p>She was ruined. Utterly ruined.</p><p>She swallowed hard; it felt as if a giant hand had just squeezed her heart. Any chance she had of making a life with Thorn was over. He, more than anyone, couldn\u2019t marry a ruined woman; their children would be pariahs after Lady Rainsford spread her malicious story.</p><p>But suddenly, unexpectedly, Vander, who had been standing silently beside her, wrapped his right arm around her shoulder. \u201cLady Rainsford,\u201d he said in the frosty voice of an insulted nobleman, \u201cI should be very careful about what you say next. You are speaking about my wife.\u201d</p> <p>India started, but Vander tightened his arm in a silent warning.</p><p>\u201cRose is my daughter,\u201d he continued, his voice dropping into the register of a civilized but homicidal maniac. \u201cWe have chosen not to reveal our marriage because of my father\u2019s unfortunate circumstance.\u201d</p><p>His large body warmed India\u2019s back, for all the world as if they were truly a family. Her mind whirling, India numbly registered that the Duke of Pindar\u2019s confinement owing to insanity was scarcely a plausible reason for a clandestine marriage.</p><p>But Vander hadn\u2019t finished. \u201cIf you again insult my wife\u2014the woman who will someday be the Duchess of Pindar\u2014I will have you thrown out of society, Lady Rainsford. Do not doubt it.\u201d</p><p>Another stunned silence shuddered through the air.</p><p>\u201cI am finding this so enjoyable,\u201d the Duke of Villiers said, his smoky voice completely unamused. \u201cAll this drama, and we weren\u2019t even charged admission. Surely, this is my cue? Lady Rainsford, I see no reason to wait for a further insult. I intend to make certain that you are never invited to another event in the rest of your natural life. I believe that it will be one of the few good deeds I\u2019ve done in a misspent life.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rainsford took in a harsh breath. Her eyes popped out a little so she looked like an angry frog as she looked from Vander, to the duke, to Rose. Finally back to India, standing in the shelter of Vander\u2019s arm. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d she shrilled. She was clearly too beside herself to consider her family\u2019s place in society.</p><p>\u201cI will hardly produce my marriage lines for one such as you,\u201d Vander said with contempt.</p><p>Faced by the united front of two ducal families\u2014and the prospect that she had grievously insulted the future Duchess of Pindar\u2014Lady Rainsford exhibited a fledgling instinct for self-preservation and commenced a babbling apology.</p><p>A moment later she faltered to a halt, confronted with five pairs of icy-cold, unsympathetic eyes.</p><p>Eleanor stepped forward, taking advantage of her silence. \u201cLady Rainsford,\u201d she said, her tone grimmer than India had ever heard it. \u201cYou will no longer be welcome at any event at which you might reasonably expect a member of the family of the Duke of Villiers or of the Duke of Pindar to appear.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rainsford opened her mouth, but Eleanor held up her hand. \u201cIf the slightest rumor ever emerges regarding Lady Xenobia or Miss Rose\u2014as well as your vile and sordid accusations\u2014we will not only put it about that you are stark raving mad, Lady Rainsford, but I will also allow my husband to wreck havoc on your finances. You and your husband will retire to the country in abject poverty. Your maid will do no more spying, because you will not be able to afford her. Have I made myself absolutely clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lady Rainsford said, with an audible gulp.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot \u2018Your Grace,\u2019 \u201d Villiers stated, his voice a cutting blade that made it clear that the woman should address his wife as would a servant, not an equal.</p><p>\u201cI think . . . I think I shall look for my daughter.\u201d Lady Rainsford scurried up the stairs and back into the house without another word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Five adults and one child kept silent until Lady Rainsford rushed through the front door past Fleming, who had ensured that no other servants had witnessed the scene.</p><p>Rose spoke before anyone else. \u201cI am not your child!\u201d she cried, looking up at India. \u201cI don\u2019t like that woman.\u201d Her little face crumpled, but she managed to halt the tears. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way people keep speaking as if my father didn\u2019t exist. My father was Will Summers, and just because he is dead doesn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t exist!\u201d</p><p>Then she twisted out of India\u2019s hold, taking a step toward Thorn. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give me away like that,\u201d she cried, her voice rising. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be their daughter. I don\u2019t even know them!\u201d</p> <p>For his part Thorn was in the grip of a rage that was only barely in check. What was India doing, declaring that Rose was her daughter? And Vander? Why in the hell had Vander made the claim that he was married to India?</p><p>India was his. Not Vander\u2019s.</p><p>She would never be Vander\u2019s.</p><p>But he looked down at Rose and realized all that would have to wait, because Rose was his as well. She was the bravest little girl he\u2019d ever known, but her lips were quivering and her eyes were terrified. Almost certainly Lady Rainsford had called her names before he arrived, ones that she didn\u2019t understand. She had been surrounded by shouting adults\u2014and she thought her guardian had given her away.</p><p>He scooped her up into his arms and turned away from the adults silently watching them. \u201cI did not give you away, Rose, and I never will. It was all a misunderstanding.\u201d He began walking toward the dower house. \u201cLet\u2019s go home and we\u2019ll ask Clara for some hot cocoa. Where is Clara, by the way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat lady came and told Clara to stay,\u201d Rose said, a sob breaking from her chest. \u201cShe brought me back to the house. But Lady Xenobia came outside just as she arrived, and they had an argument.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid my parents and Vander come at the same time as Lady Xenobia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they came just before you. Lady Rainsford is most unpleasant.\u201d Her legs clung to his side, but her rigid backbone told its own story.</p><p>\u201cShe is not a likable woman,\u201d Thorn observed, in one of the world\u2019s great understatements. He pushed open the door of the dower house. \u201cWhat you need to know, poppet, is that you are and always will be your papa\u2019s daughter. Did you know that I saved Will\u2019s life once?\u201d</p><p>She stirred in his arms, but he didn\u2019t release her. He just strode over to the sofa and sat down, keeping her on his lap. \u201cWe were around eight years old. It was winter, and there were ice floes in the Thames.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have to go into the icy water?\u201d She sounded slightly less distressed. \u201cPapa told me that he used to fish spoons out of the river.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, tightening his arms around her. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t jump in ourselves, our master would throw us off the dock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a despicable thing to do,\u201d Rose said. Her hand curled around his forearm.</p><p>\u201cHe was the same sort of person as Lady Rainsford,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cNot someone you would wish to know. The amount of food Grindel gave us depended on what we brought him. Some of the boys were too small and too frail to go into the water when it was icy, so the big boys had to earn food for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years old is not very big,\u201d Rose observed.</p><p>\u201cYour papa was the type of boy who never gave up. He dove and dove that afternoon,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe was certain that he had felt something at the bottom of the Thames, something big down in the muck. Something that might make Grindel happy enough that he would let us sleep indoors.\u201d</p><p>There were no words adequate to describe Grindel. Not for the first time, Thorn wished the man were still alive so he could kill him in memory of the boys who hadn\u2019t survived.</p><p>\u201cI wish Papa hadn\u2019t been stubborn,\u201d Rose said. \u201cDid he find that big thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time he went down, he didn\u2019t come back up. I stood on the dock and watched the spot where he dove, and I didn\u2019t see any bubbles. I didn\u2019t know what to do. The Thames is dark and murky at the best of times, and in the winter, it\u2019s like Hades down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Hades?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA terrible place. A place where a boy might find himself cut to the bone by a piece of metal sunk at the bottom, or he might come face to face with\u2014\u201d He caught himself. \u201c\u2014with a fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fish wouldn\u2019t scare me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were city boys, and we knew very little about fish. For all we knew, they would nibble our toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you jump in after Papa?\u201d</p><p>Thorn nodded. \u201cI did. It was so cold that I felt as if the ice were eating my bones. I kept going because Will was down there somewhere. Finally I saw just a flash of his yellow hair, the same hair that you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was stuck,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cHis foot was caught in a net dropped by a fisherman. I almost didn\u2019t get him out in time, but we managed. And we made it back to the dock.\u201d</p><p>The truth was that the Thames had damn well nearly taken both of them that day. He still had no idea how he got Will back to the dock.</p><p>\u201cDid you have to sleep in the graveyard that night?\u201d Rose asked. She had forgotten to keep her back stiff, and her cheek nestled against his chest as if she had always been his child.</p><p>\u201cWe did not. After your father warmed up, he unclenched his fist. And he was holding the top of a silver teapot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that little round piece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that enough so that all of you could have supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. Grindel let us all sleep inside for the next week, because it kept snowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been a very costly teapot,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>\u201cIt had a crest on it, which meant its owners would be grateful to have it back. But the more important point is that Will and I shook hands the next morning, and Will said that he owed me. And that someday he would pay me back by giving me the most valuable thing he owned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he give you?\u201d Rose tilted her head back and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Thorn smiled down at her. \u201cHe gave me you. You were the most valuable thing that Will Summers ever owned in his entire life. He couldn\u2019t stay with you, Rose. But he remembered his promise, and he mentioned it in the letter he sent to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her voice sounded terribly sad.</p><p>He put his cheek down on her soft hair, remembering Will and his stubborn, brave nature, seeing how beautifully it had come out in his daughter. \u201cNow you are mine,\u201d he told her, \u201cby gift from your father. You mustn\u2019t ever think that I would give you away, Rose. I am proud that you are mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you put me in the dower house.\u201d Her voice quavered. \u201cAnd that lady said that I was hidden away, and she made it sound awful.\u201d</p><p>Thorn had to unclench his back teeth before he shocked Rose with his opinion of Lady Rainsford. \u201cI should never have agreed to it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will never do anything like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you keep me as your ward, you can\u2019t marry Miss Rainsford,\u201d Rose said anxiously. \u201cHer mother thinks that I am Lady Xenobia\u2019s daughter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI shall not marry Laetitia. I had already made up my mind about that.\u201d</p><p>Rose nodded and began pleating his cravat with her small, nimble fingers. \u201cMiss Rainsford wouldn\u2019t have been able to read me bedtime stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaetitia is quite intelligent,\u201d Thorn said, stroking Rose\u2019s hair. \u201cI think she can\u2019t see letters well enough. She probably needs spectacles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean that Lady Xenobia isn\u2019t really married to Lord Brody either?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Xenobia can read.\u201d The words hung in the air for a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Thorn thought about India\u2019s flamelike intelligence, the brilliant way she assessed problems before moving decisively to solve them.</p><p>Although he wished she hadn\u2019t stepped forward and claimed to be Rose\u2019s mother. She had made matters infinitely more difficult, though her claim was nothing compared to Vander\u2019s. After all, once India and Thorn married, Rose truly would be her daughter. But she would never be Vander\u2019s wife.</p><p>Rose dropped his cravat, hopped from his lap, and ran over to where her doll lay. \u201cWill you tell Antigone and me stories about my papa over supper? Please?\u201d</p> <p>Thorn wanted to go to India immediately. He had to inform her that they were getting married, and to hell with what Lady Rainsford would think\u2014though he was fairly certain the woman would never breathe a word about the afternoon. His father would ruin the Rainsford family without a second\u2019s thought, and obviously she had understood that.</p><p>But Rose was at his side, Antigone clutched in her arms, her tears hardly dry. India would still be there after Rose went to sleep.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, standing up and taking her hand. \u201cShall we find Clara now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave while she is getting me ready for bed?\u201d</p><p>That was just what Thorn had thought to do. He was desperate to find India and make love to her, this time as his affianced wife.</p> <p>But Rose, who had been brave in so many circumstances, still looked haunted, and (for once) younger than her age. Her huge gray eyes were anxious. \u201cI will be in the nursery waiting for you,\u201d he promised. She smiled, and her dimple appeared.</p><p>Once Rose had been bathed and tucked in bed, Thorn set about plucking stories from thin air, stories about brave, intrepid mudlarks. Will starred as the bravest and best diver, the champion retriever of silver spoons and gold coins. Thorn said nothing of teeth, tin buttons, or rat skeletons.</p><p>Rose loved every detail. The pinched look in her face went away, and he could see that she was shaping a mythology around her father. That struck him as a good idea. When he had learned, at age twelve, that his mother was dead, he had been angry at her; it had felt like a second abandonment. Perhaps Rose would also feel anger at some point, but less so if she thought of Will as a hero.</p><p>Of course, Will\u2019s death was entirely unlike that of Thorn\u2019s mother. It was more like the death of India\u2019s parents: tragically bad luck. He didn\u2019t know why India\u2019s parents were in London the day they died, but he\u2019d bet anything that their trip had nothing to do with flight to the Bermudas. They might not have been attentive parents, but he couldn\u2019t imagine them deserting her.</p><p>Hell, he couldn\u2019t imagine anyone leaving her.</p><p>Including himself.</p><p>Now he had to make her understand that fact\u2014and Vander as well. Thinking of Vander made his blood race. His jaw clenched, and a fresh wave of raw, uncontrolled possessiveness surged through him.</p><p>Losing control was unacceptable. But for the first time in years, he wasn\u2019t sure he could keep his emotions in check.</p> <p>It was twilight by the time Thorn strode into the house. He was tired and angry, worried about Rose and frustrated by the mess Vander had made of things. He nodded at Fleming and headed upstairs to find India, so focused that at first he didn\u2019t even register a bedchamber door opening.</p><p>But the moment Vander stepped into the corridor, the tension that had coiled in Thorn\u2019s gut for the last hours detonated. He literally saw red, lunging forward and slamming Vander against the wall. \u201cWhat in the bloody hell did you think you were doing out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean when I saved the damsel in distress?\u201d Vander retorted in a low, furious voice, jerking from his grasp. \u201cI mean to marry India. It was simply a preemptive gesture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if you will!\u201d Thorn exploded into motion and they came to blows with the force of a cannon firing, reeling back into Vander\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>They crashed to the floor, knocking over a small table, then rolled across the floor with undisciplined fury, the only sounds harsh breathing, occasional thuds as a blow landed, the slamming of the door when Vander\u2019s foot caught it, a crash as another delicate table was upended. This one held a crystal decanter. It didn\u2019t shatter, but its stopper came off, and pungent brandy poured out and soaked into the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say you were married to India?\u201d Thorn snarled, pinning Vander momentarily. Vander twisted from his grip, his shirt ripping away from its sleeve. Thorn slammed back into him, crushing him to the floorboards with his arm across his throat. \u201cDamn you, answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am marrying her,\u201d Vander shouted. With a violent lunge to the side, he freed himself again. \u201cThe whole household is buzzing with the fact that you have obtained a blank license in order to marry Lala; I\u2019ll take that off your hands. I\u2019m marrying India in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s answer was more a howl than a reply. Two minutes later, he had Vander pinned again. He hadn\u2019t bested Vander at fisticuffs in years, but by God, he was winning this time. \u201cIndia is mine,\u201d he roared, knowing he was on the verge of losing his final shred of control, every lethal instinct honed in childhood loosed by fury.</p><p>\u201cI safeguarded her reputation after you allowed it to be savaged by that harpy,\u201d Vander bellowed back. \u201cYou can save Lala from a fate worse than death\u2014living with her despicable mother\u2014but I shall marry India. Because I was the one who stepped forward to protect her, you unmitigated bastard!\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s words struck with twice the force of his fists. Thorn\u2019s hands loosened and Vander wrenched himself away, rolling to sit up, back to the wall.</p><p>Thorn\u2019s right eye was swelling shut, and remnants of his shirt hung from his neck. He pulled his collar free and cast it aside. \u201cYou shall not marry her,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you announced: I am the only man who will ever marry India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept with her,\u201d Vander said flatly. \u201cYou cock-proud arse, you slept with the most desirable woman in England\u2014don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t, because a blind man could see the way you look at her\u2014and you didn\u2019t ask for her hand? And when her reputation was trodden into the mud by the devil herself, you said nothing. Are you out of your bloody mind?\u201d His voice had risen to a shout again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Thorn replied. Every inch of his body trembled with ferocity.</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Vander leaned his head back against the wall, chest still heaving. \u201cI\u2019d marry her with or without Lady Rainsford\u2019s provocation, you jackass. I made up my mind to propose after no more than one look at her and a single conversation, let alone a kiss. And you slept with her as if she were a mere doxy, and then let her reputation be smeared into the ground.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI asked her to marry me last night,\u201d Thorn snarled. \u201cShe refused me, so I could hardly claim to be married to her. I planned to ask her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked her to be your wife after you slept with her? You thought that Lady Xenobia India St. Clair would marry you because you were gracious enough to offer your hand after bedding her? Why would she want to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might have been carrying my child,\u201d Thorn said tightly. But a bitter chill was sweeping through him. Vander was right. Why the hell would India want to marry him?</p><p>Vander made a guttural sound of disgust and spat his words. \u201cYou didn\u2019t use a sheath? What in the hell were you thinking?\u201d His eyes glittered at Thorn in the darkening room.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think around her,\u201d Thorn said, telling him the truth. \u201cWhen I asked her to marry me, she refused. She said that she\u2019d give me the child if we had one.\u201d Vander\u2014more than anyone else in the world\u2014would know what that meant to him. The agony that her comment roused.</p><p>But Vander just snorted. \u201cYou believed her? Damn it, Thorn, you don\u2019t really want her. You don\u2019t even know her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize she was lying to me until later,\u201d Thorn said tightly.</p><p>\u201cShe baited a trap and you fell into it. You might have had a chance with her\u2014after all, she took you into her bed\u2014but that\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Images tumbled through Thorn\u2019s mind: Rose looking up at India as she read her a book, and India telling him about her parents\u2019 desertion. Vander was right. She had tested him, and he had failed.</p> <p>He stood up, slowly, knowing that he would be covered with bruises in a few hours. They had gone at each other like rabid animals.</p><p>Vander still sat against the wall, his arms on his knees. Without raising his head, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s mine, Thorn, and the sooner you get used to it, the better. You treated her like a doxy, and you didn\u2019t protect her when she needed it.\u201d</p><p>Every word struck Thorn\u2019s gut like another blow from a balled-up fist.</p><p>Then Vander looked up, pushing back hair soaked with sweat and brandy. \u201cYou had your shot, and you lost. I\u2019m going to marry her. I\u2019ll leave it to you whether we remain friends.\u201d He got up, lurching slightly, one hand pressed against his side, and left without a backward glance.</p><p>Thorn walked into his own room reeking of spirits, with vision only in his left eye.</p><p>The hell with it. That dream was over. He\u2019d had it for, what, half a day? The dream that India was his, that he could marry a woman like her: brilliant, glowing, beautiful . . . funny. As wild in bed as she was elsewhere, the kind of woman who lunged at life, fear be damned, and embraced it.</p> <p>But Lady Xenobia India was a lady. And he was a bastard, who had behaved like a bastard. Of course she didn\u2019t want him. She\u2019d let him down kindly, in fact.</p><p>He sank into a steaming bath and forced himself to face the truth. He would offer his hand in marriage one more time, if only to prove to India that his proposal was motivated by far more than the possibility of a baby.</p><p>But it was a useless gesture. Daughters of marquesses didn\u2019t marry bastards, not in any part of England that he\u2019d heard of. India would marry Vander. She was meant to be a duchess. They would be happy together, shining, beautiful examples of England\u2019s peerage.</p><p>He got out of the bath and dressed swiftly. If he was going to ask a future duchess to marry him, he would do it like the gentleman he wasn\u2019t. Not by dragging her into an alcove and treating her like a whore. No, he would go on one knee, he decided, tying his cravat in a Gordian knot.</p><p>And once she rejected him, that would be that. He would lose his oldest and truest friend and the woman he loved in one blow. Suffocating darkness welled inside him at the thought.</p><p>By now it was nearly time for the evening meal; presumably India would be downstairs, sipping a sherry with the others. He briefly wondered if Lady Rainsford had departed for London or was still cowering in her room, then he discarded the thought. He didn\u2019t give a damn what happened to the lady or, frankly, to her daughter.</p><p>He descended the stairs, planning to draw India to his study\u2014respectfully\u2014in order to request her hand in marriage. His father was waiting in the entry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t speak now,\u201d Thorn said, heading for the drawing room.</p> <p>\u201cSon.\u201d</p><p>Something in Villiers\u2019s voice made Thorn pause and turn back.</p><p>\u201cYou are looking somewhat the worse for wear.\u201d</p><p>Thorn gestured impatiently. \u201cSurely you heard the uproar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFleming did a fine job of keeping everyone on the ground floor.\u201d The duke\u2019s face was expressionless, but his eyes weren\u2019t. \u201cThey took the special license, Tobias. If you leave now, you can catch them; they won\u2019t be able to marry until morning. They went to Piggleston, where the parish church has a resident vicar.\u201d</p><p>Thorn felt as if a hammer smashed into the back of his neck. The feelings that coursed through him had nothing to do with civilization and everything to do with carnage.</p><p>He was going to kill Vander. Murder him. Tear him limb from limb.</p><p>Blood began pounding through his limbs, and suddenly he knew, with absolute certainty, that he could murder his closest friend without turning a hair. The hell with being respectful to India. She was his, and no damn duke was going to have her, not if he had to rip her away from Vander at the altar and throw her into his carriage.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said, turning to the door, his mind churning. He had to get on the road, find them, kill Vander, and marry India.</p><p>Of course she left with Vander. What else could she do? Thorn had never claimed her, not really.</p><p>\u201cMy carriage is waiting,\u201d his father said.</p><p>Indeed, the duke\u2019s traveling coach stood in the drive, horses stamping their hooves and grooms standing at the ready.</p><p>Thorn nodded to his father, caught a flash of wicked amusement in his eyes\u2014yet another sign of the duke\u2019s warped paternal instincts\u2014and climbed into the carriage, directing the coachman to the largest inn in Piggleston. He spent the next few hours alternating between berating himself and suppressing stifling waves of anger at Vander. Finally, the horses trotted off the post road and moved onto cobbled streets.</p><p>When they pulled into the courtyard of the Coach and Horn, Thorn leapt down and roused the innkeeper. But though he handed out five-pound notes as if they were ha\u2019pennies, every man he talked to, at all three inns in Piggleston, swore up and down that no couples resembling Vander and India had been seen. By that point a muscle was jumping in Thorn\u2019s jaw, and his face was apparently so distorted by rage\u2014not to mention his black eye\u2014that men fell back as he approached.</p><p>There was nothing more he could do. He\u2019d marked the location of the church, and he would be there in the morning to stop the wedding.</p><p>India would not marry Vander, if Thorn had to assault the vicar at the altar.</p><p>He took a room, but he couldn\u2019t lie down. Every time he pictured Vander and India on a bed together, scorching pain shot through him. The memory of her face when she lied to him and he believed her . . . the scorn on her face when she told him that she\u2019d been a virgin, though he hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>That was why she would marry Vander. He had broken what they had . . . in fact, he was afraid that he had broken her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t fought back against Lady Rainsford\u2019s ugly insults. She hadn\u2019t said another word after coming forward to claim Rose as her own. That wasn\u2019t like her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared into the dark, waiting.</p><p>Planning.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>India lay on her back, staring up at the bed canopy. She felt like the ice princess in the fairy story, the one with a frozen heart. Someone had carved out the inside of her body and replaced her heart with ice.</p> <p>Evidence of that? Next to her was a valiant and handsome lord, a fairy-tale prince. She should have been indescribably happy at this moment.</p><p>Vander was on his side, head propped on one hand, watching her. She knew he had a sweet expression, because she\u2019d glanced at him. She also knew that he was able to keep his mouth shut, because he wasn\u2019t saying anything. And she knew his body was as muscled as any medieval knight, because there it was, albeit clothed, next to her on the bed.</p><p>There was no unmarried woman in all England who wouldn\u2019t secretly want to lie next to a future duke while he gazed at her with that expression. It was scandalous to invite him to do so, of course, but she was determined to erase the memory of Thorn lying beside her. Not that Thorn had ever given her a worshipful glance, because he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Vander must have gotten tired of waiting for her to speak, because he reached out and gently put a hand on her wrist. It was a large hand, but she didn\u2019t think it was quite as large as Thorn\u2019s.</p><p>Thorn\u2019s body was traced all over with scars. Like a warrior\u2019s.</p> <p>Again she reminded herself that Thorn had never looked at her the way Vander was now. Vander seemed to think she was wonderful.</p><p>Thorn looked at her as if she were mad, and sometimes, as if she made him laugh. The rest of the time he looked at her with such raw desire that he seemed ready to throw her to the ground.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d done that, hadn\u2019t he? He had taken her like a sluttish housemaid, downstairs, where anyone could have caught them. She couldn\u2019t have been the first woman to fall into Mr. Dautry\u2019s snare. She was sure of it. There were probably broken hearts strewn all over England.</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d Vander said quietly. He began tracing a soothing pattern on her arm.</p><p>She glanced at him again, just to confirm that he was as handsome as she thought. He was. Many English gentlemen had jaws and chins that receded in a steady slope right down to their necks. Vander looked like one of those Greek statues she\u2019d put in Thorn\u2019s attic. They would have beautiful children together.</p><p>What\u2019s more, he gave her a feeling of safety. He was big and bold, and he would frighten off Lady Rainsford or anyone else who thought to attack her. He would be a good husband.</p> <p>She could do this.</p><p>She could sleep with him. And marry him. Surely.</p><p>\u201cIn the scene with Lady Rainsford, you were like St. George killing the dragon,\u201d she said, managing a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cAlas, the dragon is not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very honorable, though, the way you announced that we were already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is the desire of my heart,\u201d Vander stated, his eyes intent on hers.</p><p>In the last hour, he had said all the respectful, adoring things that Thorn had never said or thought. What\u2019s more, Vander was on the same bed with her, and hadn\u2019t tried to kiss her. He cherished and respected her.</p><p>They would have a fine marriage.</p> <p>Above her, the bed curtains were gathered and pleated into a pretty rosette. She was done with lying. \u201cThere was a slender chance that I may have been carrying Thorn\u2019s child,\u201d she said, not looking to the side. \u201cIt did not come to pass.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, she turned her head. Vander\u2019s jaw was clenched.</p><p>\u201cAre you disgusted with me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am grappling with a wish to murder my closest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI led him to believe that I had experience,\u201d she said drearily. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone believe that you are a loose woman? You are like a treasure that a man could spend his life unwrapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThorn believed me. And then when he announced that we would marry, I refused and told him that I would give him our child when it was born.\u201d Tears pressed on her eyes and made them ache. \u201cHe believed me. Both times, he believed me.\u201d</p><p>Vander leaned closer. \u201cHe\u2019s damaged, India. I don\u2019t want to make excuses for him, but that\u2019s the truth. Once we marry, any child you carry will be mine.\u201d His eyes lightened and his mouth curved into a smile. \u201cIn fact, let\u2019s make love right now.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to make her feel better, so India smiled at him. But tears were beginning to spill from her eyes. \u201cThorn desires me, but he doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>Vander sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend, but he\u2019s also an ass, who took advantage of you. He never should have slept with you, let alone without using a French letter.\u201d</p><p>Hot tears ran down India\u2019s cheeks. \u201cHe said . . . he said he couldn\u2019t control himself around me.\u201d The sympathy in Vander\u2019s eyes was like a kick in the stomach. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s what men always say.\u201d</p><p>This day had definitely been the worst of her life, other than the day she had been told of her parents\u2019 death. \u201cYou rescued me from Lady Rainsford,\u201d she said, a little sob breaking in her chest. \u201cHe just stood there, watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not quite true. To be fair, I thought he would strangle the woman.\u201d</p><p>India had forgotten the moment when Thorn\u2019s face went black and he moved toward Lady Rainsford, fists clenched. \u201cBut you told her we were married and forced her to stop calling me names.\u201d</p><p>Vander pulled a handkerchief from his pocket. \u201cThorn may be unable to see you clearly,\u201d he said, gently wiping away her tears, \u201cbut I can.\u201d</p><p>India was bent on telling him everything. \u201cAfter . . . after she had said those things to me, and I\u2014\u201d She faltered to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you say that Rose was your child?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking. I got angry, and I wanted Lady Rainsford to stop ranting. But it\u2019s probably just as well. Thorn wants to marry someone sweet and kind. He told me that Lala was perfect for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d Vander\u2019s warm brown eyes were nothing at all like Thorn\u2019s wintery gray ones.</p><p>\u201cHe made me feel beautiful, and he listened to me.\u201d She managed to shrug. \u201cI sound like the seduced virgin in a melodrama, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Vander ran his fingers down her cheek. \u201cI cannot tell you what Thorn is or was thinking, India. All I know is that you are unlike any other woman I\u2019ve ever met. You\u2019re exquisite, and brilliant, and brave. You are perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like this,\u201d she whispered, wiping away another tear. \u201cI don\u2019t cry. Even when my parents left me, I didn\u2019t cry.\u201d The sympathy in his eyes was humiliating. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t whisper either!\u201d</p><p>Thorn didn\u2019t love her. He didn\u2019t care. He believed her lies, even when she told him\u2014stupidly told him\u2014an absurd falsehood that a stranger could have seen through.</p><p>It was over, absolutely over. She simply had to make herself believe that.</p><p>\u201cAll I can say is that I\u2019m deeply grateful to the loathsome Lady Rainsford,\u201d Vander said. \u201cI had the chance to proclaim that you were my wife. And it felt good, India. It felt right. You are my future duchess. Let\u2019s see how it sounds: Hello, Your Grace.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His thumb rubbed her bottom lip, and his eyes flared.</p><p>\u201cHello, wife.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Thorn arrived at the church door at six o\u2019clock the next morning. The door was locked, and the village square was hushed and silent. The only sign of life came from the bakery across the square. Since there were no benches he took a seat on a gravestone, and waited.</p> <p>He had never been one to ride to the hounds. But that was because he saw no point in chasing after animals, when the world of humans was so predatory. Now his entire body was poised for the hunt, waiting for the moment when either the vicar or India would appear. Either one.</p><p>But no one came. After some time, the baker\u2019s door opened, signaling that fresh bread was available. As if on cue, villagers began to appear, greeting each other as they headed across the square for a fresh loaf. A few of them glanced at him, sitting with his arms folded, but they said nothing.</p><p>Thorn was quite certain that neither his dour expression nor his battered face was welcoming. Moreover, by now his instincts were starting to tell him that something was wrong. If he were Vander, he would take India to the church first thing in the morning.</p><p>Unless they were still in bed. Unless . . . His jaw clenched again. If India and Vander were truly together, and India was happy, he would leave. He would probably leave England altogether.</p><p>It could be that his father had made a mistake. They had traveled to some other town, which is why he\u2019d been unable to find mention of them at the inns.</p> <p>As he considered what to do next, two women trotted toward the church across the square. Just as they came by him, one said, \u201cIf the groom is handing out shillings, I want to be there. Walk a little faster, woman!\u201d They disappeared down the street to the right of the church.</p><p>His mind went blank. It seemed he was too late. He walked after the women and discovered that there was a small chapel attached to the parish house. Three or four chattering villagers were walking away from the door, looking with satisfaction at the coins they held in their hands.</p><p>He stopped the same woman who had rushed past him a moment ago. \u201cHave I missed the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, you have,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cFriends of yours? What a shame. And I\u2019m sure they would have liked to have you with them, as my husband had to act as one of the witnesses.\u201d She jerked her head toward the chapel. \u201cGo right in, sir. They\u2019re signing the book in the back, but they\u2019ll be out in a moment.\u201d</p><p>Thorn followed her gaze. Opposite the chapel was his own damned carriage.</p><p>He was too late.</p> <p>He was too late, and it was his own damned fault. Why hadn\u2019t he realized that he\u2019d never felt lust like that before\u2014which meant it wasn\u2019t just lust? He wanted her, all of her, from the tips of India\u2019s toes to all that gorgeous hair.</p><p>Now he would never wake up next to her, roll over, take her sleepy mouth. He would never hold their first child, born in wedlock or not.</p><p>The thought nearly drove him to his knees, there in an unfamiliar village where it was starting to drizzle. He had never felt despair like this before\u2014not when he was a mudlark, not when he learned his mother had died without ever returning for him . . . never.</p><p>One foot followed another to the door of the chapel. He would see her once more, and after that he would leave the country. Vander would understand. Vander would know precisely what Thorn had lost.</p><p>As he reached the door, a flock of people emerged: the vicar, the sexton, a parishioner, another parishioner . . .</p><p>The bride.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Lala had never been so happy in her life. In fact, she was fairly sure that she\u2019d never had any idea what joy was, because anything she\u2019d experienced to this point had been a pale, sickly imitation.</p> <p>She tucked her hand into John Hatfield\u2019s and looked up to see him smiling at her. She couldn\u2019t help but sigh: who would have thought that such an intelligent man would ever want her, Lala? And yet he had told her that he didn\u2019t believe she was stupid at all, but that something was wrong with her vision that prevented her from seeing print correctly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like being blind,\u201d he had told her the evening before. \u201cHow could that be considered your fault?\u201d</p><p>Around him, Lala felt intelligent. She was hungry to learn everything she could about babies, and illnesses, and the work of a doctor. She couldn\u2019t wait to meet his cook, and learn how to run her own household.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite certain that you won\u2019t mind the fact that Starberry Court will never be your home?\u201d John asked now, his eyes on hers.</p><p>She laughed. Her mother and father would likely disown her, but she didn\u2019t care. She had her husband and his lovely house. She would go on rounds with him, and feel useful for the first time in her life. No: she would be useful.</p><p>She would feel loved. And she would be loved.</p><p>He bent his head and kissed her. \u201cI never imagined that a woman would give up a duke\u2019s son for me.\u201d</p><p>Lala\u2019s smile only grew wider. She would have paid a fortune to avoid marriage to Mr. Dautry. Yet intuition told her that it would be better if she didn\u2019t clarify that for her new husband. Let him think that earls and dukes had regularly thrown themselves at her feet, and she had rejected them all. For him.</p><p>They walked from the chapel together, husband and wife.</p><p>She froze in the open doorway.</p><p>He was there, looking like an angel of death. There was a moment of silence as she and John stood at the top of the steps, Mr. Dautry at the bottom, arms crossed.</p><p>Mr. Dautry\u2019s face was drawn and she couldn\u2019t read his expression. Lala found herself instinctively trembling. His face was battered, as if he\u2019d already been in a fight.</p><p>John said, \u201cIf you think to sue me for alienation of affection, you\u2019ll find that I own very little in the world. I have nothing of value other than Laetitia, and I will not give her up.\u201d The words rang out in the morning air.</p><p>Dautry was staring up at them, his jaw clenched. He looked like a devil, standing there with his hair tumbling around his ears and no cravat to be seen. At the same time, he looked as if he\u2019d taken a tremendous blow.</p><p>She had never imagined that he loved her so much. Lala moved a bit closer to her new husband, clinging to his arm.</p><p>\u201cWe are fast married,\u201d John continued. \u201cLaetitia is now Mrs. Hatfield.\u201d He sounded completely calm, even though he was confronting one of the richest men in all England, one whose fianc\u00e9e he had stolen. Well, she hadn\u2019t quite been his fianc\u00e9e, but very nearly.</p><p>Mr. Dautry shook himself, like a dog coming out of the rain. \u201cIn that case, allow me to be the first to congratulate you.\u201d His voice was oddly hoarse, but the words were clear enough.</p><p>They walked down the steps. Her husband gently released her arm and the men shook hands, somewhat to her surprise.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you used the special license?\u201d Dautry asked.</p><p>\u201cI shall, of course, reimburse you,\u201d John said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cConsider it my wedding present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is remarkably gracious of you.\u201d John bowed again.</p><p>\u201cDid you inform Lady Rainsford of your intentions?\u201d Mr. Dautry asked.</p><p>\u201cLady Rainsford and I do not always see eye to eye,\u201d John replied.</p><p>\u201cYou astonish me,\u201d Mr. Dautry replied.</p><p>John smiled at that. \u201cWe had a candid exchange on the subject of my wife\u2019s intelligence, after which Laetitia and I bade her mother goodbye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lala slipped her hand back into the crook of her husband\u2019s arm and beamed at Dautry. \u201cI fully expect to be disowned, and she will not pay us a visit for a long time, or indeed, possibly ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA consummation devoutly to be wished,\u201d Mr. Dautry stated.</p><p>Lala had no idea what he meant, but John gave him a lopsided grin and said, \u201cI hope that if Lady Rainsford decides to visit, I will choose to be, instead of Hamlet\u2019s not to be.\u201d</p><p>Lala leaned her head against John\u2019s arm as they watched Dautry stride back down the street.</p> <p>\u201cI think he means to be a patron to you,\u201d Lala said. \u201cPerhaps I shall ask him to sponsor a small hospital in the village. He has the money for it, by all accounts.\u201d</p><p>John looked down at her, a thrilling frown on his face. \u201cI won\u2019t have you spending time with that man, Laetitia. He obviously adores you, since he drove all the way here in an attempt to stop your wedding. God knows what would have happened if he\u2019d arrived an hour earlier.\u201d</p><p>Lala shivered. When they first walked out the door, Mr. Dautry had looked ready to murder John. But once he understood it was too late, he\u2019d shown himself to be a gentleman.</p><p>\u201cHe will marry,\u201d she said, beginning to walk, because she couldn\u2019t wait to travel back to their own house. \u201cOnce Starberry Court has a mistress, I\u2019ll speak to him about a village hospital in West Drayton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that the lord of the manor once loved my wife, even if he does marry someone else. I don\u2019t want you ever to be alone with him,\u201d John ordered.</p> <p>The look in his eyes made Lala feel warm all over. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she breathed, stopping in her tracks.</p><p>John glanced down the deserted street, then he pulled her into his arms. He dropped a sweet buss on her lips, but when they opened beneath his, it all changed.</p><p>Mrs. John Hatfield stood in that empty street for twenty minutes, while her husband gave her a kiss so deep and passionate that they both forgot where they were\u2014at least until the heavens opened and they had to dash through a downpour to the carriage, laughing all the way.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>India woke early in the morning, still exhausted. She wished she were excited about marrying Vander and becoming a duchess someday. She truly did. She had allowed him into her bedchamber the previous evening, thinking that perhaps she would find herself seduced.</p><p>It had made sense at the time: if she found herself enticed by the handsome lord with adoration in his eyes, it stood to reason that she would stop thinking about Thorn.</p> <p>But in the end they hadn\u2019t even kissed.</p><p>She would never be Vander\u2019s wife. She just didn\u2019t feel that way about him.</p><p>Thorn, though . . .</p><p>He would likely be at breakfast. Her heart started beating quickly at the thought. Presumably, he no longer wished to marry Lala after Lady Rainsford\u2019s behavior.</p><p>Not that it meant he would turn to her; likely he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She would wish him well in the future, in a dignified, yet friendly, manner. The only thing she had left was her self-respect, and even that was in shreds and tatters.</p><p>Still, she felt better after a bath, not to mention dressing in a close-fitting gown with a violet overlay and a low bosom. It felt as if she were going to war\u2014in which case she might as well dress with her own version of armor.</p><p>But in the breakfast room, no one was to be seen besides the butler. \u201cHis Grace and Lord Brody have not yet risen,\u201d Fleming announced, escorting her to a seat.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Mr. Dautry?\u201d India asked, trying to give her voice a carefree lilt.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry is not at home.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected that. She paused while unfolding her napkin and looked up. \u201cNot home? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not at liberty to say, my lady.\u201d Then he added, \u201cHe departed in the Duke of Villiers\u2019s carriage last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he take his own carriage?\u201d</p><p>The lines next to the butler\u2019s mouth deepened. \u201cIt was in use.\u201d</p><p>India frowned. Fleming was Thorn\u2019s butler, of course, but in a certain way, he would always be hers too. After all, she had hired him. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Fleming, surely I might know who was using Mr. Dautry\u2019s carriage?\u201d</p><p>The butler closed the door to the breakfast room and lowered his voice. \u201cIt was Dr. Hatfield and Miss Rainsford, my lady. At Mr. Dautry\u2019s request, I sent a man two days ago to acquire a blank special license from the Archbishop of Canterbury.\u201d</p><p>Not even by a flicker in his eye did he reveal that the license had been meant for India and his master, even though he had to know the truth. Years of experience had taught India that butlers always knew a household\u2019s secrets.</p><p>\u201cShortly after the confrontation with Lady Rainsford outside the house,\u201d Fleming continued, \u201cDr. Hatfield requested a meeting with the lady, and I\u2019m afraid that there was a further exchange of words in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Rainsford had a very distressing afternoon,\u201d India observed, not bothering to feign dismay.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady. Unfortunately, she made a number of vehement\u2014one might even say vituperative\u2014remarks before retiring to her chamber. The door to the library was open, and it was impossible not to hear the exchange,\u201d he added.</p><p>India waved her hand impatiently. It would have required superhuman restraint not to listen. \u201cWas Miss Rainsford in the library as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she was not. But the Duke of Villiers was. After Lady Rainsford departed, His Grace offered Mr. Dautry\u2019s special license to Dr. Hatfield, and the doctor accepted it.\u201d</p><p>India gasped. \u201cHe did? Did he inform Mr. Dautry that he was doing so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt that time, Mr. Dautry was in the dower house with Miss Rose.\u201d Fleming hesitated, and added, \u201cI fear that His Grace may have underestimated Mr. Dautry\u2019s feelings with regard to Miss Rainsford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d India said, her voice faint.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mr. Dautry returned to the house, I was below stairs. But I understand that on learning of the elopement, he made off with all speed in an attempt to catch the pair before the wedding took place.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s heart stopped for a moment. Thorn had gone after Lala. He had desperately tried to stop her marriage to another. He must truly love Lala.</p><p>She herself had been nothing more than an available body.</p><p>If she was going to become a fallen woman, at the very least she could have kept her heart whole.</p><p>But no . . . she never stopped loving her parents, even when they forgot to feed her, and she probably wouldn\u2019t stop loving Thorn either. Right now, she felt like a wounded animal. It hurt to love someone like this.</p><p>Despite herself, her eyes filled with tears and her lip trembled. Fleming discarded his butler\u2019s code of conduct and put a hand on her shoulder, his eyes deeply sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she said, swallowing hard and not even trying to hide the pain. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I think . . . I think I shall return to London immediately, if you would be so good as to summon my carriage, Fleming. My maid can follow with my godmother whenever Lady Adelaide wishes to make the journey.\u201d</p><p>It was only by a miracle that she managed to avoid bursting into tears before she climbed into her carriage. And the fact that Fleming pressed four fresh handkerchiefs into her hand showed that he knew precisely when those tears would escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As it turned out, India cried from the moment the carriage entered the post road, all the way to London. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Peters,\u201d she told Adelaide\u2019s alarmed butler, upon her arrival back home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a-a-a very trying day.\u201d</p><p>What woman wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with Thorn? He was seductive and yet tender and sweet. He had genuinely listened to her, and created the India rubber band on her design. He was bawdy and rough and real, in a way that true gentlemen never were.</p><p>Even though he wasn\u2019t a gentleman by birth, he had always been scrupulously honest. He hadn\u2019t meant to sweep her off her feet. He had looked her in the eyes, more than once, and told her that their relationship was temporary, and that he planned to marry Lala.</p><p>A sob wrenched her chest. The stupid thing was that men had tried to tumble her for years. They\u2019d assumed that since they were hiring a woman and paying a woman, bedding that woman came as part of the package.</p> <p>She had failed herself. She had forgotten the safeguards she put in place years ago, the lessons she learned from her father and mother about life. About love.</p><p>Now she felt as if a vital organ had been gouged out of her. Who would have imagined that love could hurt like this?</p><p>She had to build a new life, one that wasn\u2019t agonizingly painful.</p><p>One that didn\u2019t have Thorn in it.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p> <p>Thorn kept poking at his feelings for India, the way one might poke a sore tooth. This raw possessiveness wasn\u2019t something he ever thought to experience. Planned to experience.</p><p>He drove straight back from Piggleston, consumed the entire way by relief, and arrived at Starberry Court just before the noon hour. He needed answers.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my father?\u201d he asked, cutting Fleming off before his butler could utter a word.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace is in the library. But, sir\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, Fleming.\u201d Thorn found the duke alone, sitting before a chessboard, no doubt studying some arcane stratagem. Villiers looked up as Thorn entered. Damn it, he looked completely unrepentant. In fact, he looked amused.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell was that about?\u201d Thorn said, keeping his voice controlled. There was no point in howling at the Duke of Villiers, as he knew from childhood experience. \u201cYou knew damn well that I didn\u2019t care for Laetitia Rainsford. You sent me on a wild-goose chase.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t enjoy your trip to Piggleston?\u201d</p><p>Thorn had learned\u2014if not inherited\u2014his deadly glare from Villiers; after a moment, the corners of the duke\u2019s mouth curled up and he said, \u201cAs your father, I thought you could use a lesson in that most perplexing of emotions: love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew that I wanted to marry India before you drove me halfway to the next county,\u201d Thorn retorted.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the air. It was true that Thorn had decided to ask for India\u2019s hand in marriage. But he hadn\u2019t understood just how much he felt for her until the darkest hour of the morning, when he\u2019d realized what life would be like without her at his side.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question of bedding her. She was his true north, his other half.</p><p>\u201cYou are my son,\u201d the duke continued, his eyes softening. \u201cI thought there was a good chance you\u2019d inherited my idiocy. By the way, she turned down Lord Brody\u2019s proposal of marriage last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Thorn felt that muscle jumping in his jaw again.</p> <p>\u201cI kept him company while he drowned himself in a bottle of Cognac,\u201d the duke said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect he\u2019ll be down until well into the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll turn to me. Why would she accept my offer?\u201d Thorn said savagely. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to offer her that he hasn\u2019t, and in truth, a great deal less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you,\u201d his father said calmly. \u201cThough the emotion won\u2019t be enough on its own. Eleanor fell in love with me, but I had made so damn many mistakes by then that she wanted nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no duke,\u201d Thorn said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my distinct impression that you treated her like the bastard you are. Do you remember how I courted your stepmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bought her a ring the size of a swallow\u2019s egg, you put on a black coat, and you pretended to be your own cousin.\u201d</p><p>The duke grinned. \u201cI pretended to be a gentleman, which I am not, duke or no. You\u2019ll have to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a black coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend to be a gentleman,\u201d his father advised. \u201cTell her that she resembles a rose; make a formal proposal. But first go to Rundell &amp; Bridge to buy a diamond, and tell them I sent you. She has returned to London, so you can (so to speak) kill two birds with one stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if India is interested in diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gemstone would she prefer?\u201d</p><p>Thorn thought of India\u2019s mother\u2019s jewels, lost in the Thames. \u201cNothing I could buy for her. More to the point, like Eleanor, she can marry the highest in the land. You are the highest, which means your proposal and mine are hardly parallel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just turned down a duke\u2019s heir,\u201d Villiers observed. His eyes turned fierce and he said, \u201cYou are the highest in the land, Tobias. You have more brains and balls than any man in the peerage, and that woman knows it.\u201d</p><p>Thorn smiled faintly. \u201cYou forgot to add that I\u2019m your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of which were inherited from me, naturally,\u201d his father said with satisfaction.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>129 Maddox Street</p><p>London residence of Lady Adelaide Swift</p><p>and Lady Xenobia India St. Clair</p><p>By late afternoon India had her tears more or less under control. She would find a husband who didn\u2019t constantly remind her about the \u201cperfect\u201d woman he planned to marry, but made it clear that she was that woman.</p><p>The only time she\u2019d seen that sort of look in Thorn\u2019s eyes was after Vander joined them in the country. Then she caught him watching her with a possessiveness that had thrilled her. But it hadn\u2019t really had anything to do with her. It was about his rivalry with Vander.</p><p>Before she met Thorn, she had decided to find a man who would permit her to take charge of the household accounts. The idea of Thorn allowing her to run their life was enough to push a hollow laugh from her throat. She needed to marry a reasonable, measured man.</p><p>Thorn had identified the perfect trait for his spouse, and he hadn\u2019t wavered from his opinion. He had chosen Lala because she was sweet and always would be.</p><p>Just because life hadn\u2019t made her sweet didn\u2019t mean that a man couldn\u2019t love her. She would find a man who would love her just as she was. Neither of her most ardent suitors\u2014Fitzroy and Nugent\u2014would suit; they would be horrified if she lost her temper. Perhaps she should travel to the Continent. Weren\u2019t Spanish women famous for having fiery tempers?</p><p>India was thinking about black-eyed Spanish men when the door opened and the butler ushered Thorn into her drawing room. She jumped to her feet as her heart threw itself into double time.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cGood afternoon, Lady Xenobia.\u201d</p><p>India took one look at his tousled dark hair and bruised eye and\u2014absurdly\u2014longing ignited in her very blood. There was no other man like him, one whose strength and intelligence swirled around him like a cloak, a complement to his bone-deep confidence. Though perhaps a better word was arrogance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Belying his battered face, he was wearing a coat as extraordinary as any his father had ever donned: he looked ready to dance attendance on a queen.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing here, Thorn?\u201d she asked, affecting a casual tone with effort. \u201cAre you . . . did you catch up with Dr. Hatfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d It was no wonder he looked tired. He had lost his ideal spouse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll find someone else,\u201d she offered, feeling the words chip away at her heart.</p> <p>\u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to ask you to marry me, India. To pay me the very great honor of becoming my bride.\u201d</p><p>India knew why this was happening. The moment Vander had stepped forward and told Lady Rainsford that they were married, she\u2019d seen the look in Thorn\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Men like Thorn were ferociously competitive. They didn\u2019t give up, and failure was just a temporary inconvenience. In fact, it was likely the competition had escalated once Lala had removed herself from the equation by eloping with Dr. Hatfield. It left India as the bone of contention.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is your eye bruised?\u201d she asked sharply, unable to respond to the question she had longed for\u2014not when it was simply offered, like a business proposition to be accepted or rejected.</p><p>\u201cVander,\u201d he said, confirming her guess.</p><p>Her heart sank. She stood between two snarling wolfhounds. The story never ended very well for the bone.</p><p>\u201cYou fought over me,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cThat is irrelevant,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cYou are the epitome of beauty and grace, India. I cannot imagine spending my life with anyone other than you, and I beg for nothing more than the honor of your hand in marriage.\u201d</p><p>The words rolled out of his mouth with all the passion of a vicar reciting his third service of the day. He was obviously exhausted, his eyes shaded with some emotion that she couldn\u2019t interpret. He took a step closer and held out his hand. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p> <p>A diamond ring lay in his palm, a lavish, costly ring. India looked at it, and back at his face.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t come to say that he was in love with her, as she had secretly dreamed. He was asking her to marry him because Vander had claimed her, and Lala had got away.</p><p>He was here because he wanted to win. She swallowed hard. Her heart was breaking. Lala was the golden fleece and India was apparently the consolation prize.</p><p>It was as if the world was presenting her with everything she wanted . . . in all the wrong ways.</p><p>Her throat tightened painfully, but she refused to cry in front of him. She was the daughter of a marquess, even if her papa was the oddest nobleman who\u2019d ever held the title. She was Lady Xenobia St. Clair.</p><p>Somehow she found her Lady Xenobia voice, the cool, businesslike voice that expected\u2014and received\u2014complete obedience. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I must refuse your very moving offer of marriage.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned into hers, so intense in their focus that she felt a bit dizzy. \u201cWhy? Did I say it incorrectly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It was one of the more eloquent I have received.\u201d</p> <p>A movement caught her eyes, and she saw his right fist clench. The skin was broken over his knuckles, presumably from pummeling Vander.</p><p>\u201cYours is not my first marriage proposal, but it is nonetheless appreciated.\u201d Her heart wanted to give in and say yes. Who cared why he was proposing? Maybe he would fall in love with her later. . . .</p><p>But every ounce of practicality in her screamed no. He wouldn\u2019t. Men who slept with an available woman didn\u2019t later declare their love. If she hadn\u2019t succumbed to him like a trollop, she could have pretended to herself that he would love her someday. She could have lied to herself.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>Frustration burned through Thorn as he stood before India. She was so damned beautiful. Even though she looked pale and was far too quiet.</p><p>Abruptly, he decided to discard his father\u2019s advice. At this point he should kneel and slip the ring on India\u2019s finger, but he had the feeling that she\u2019d back away and he\u2019d be left on his knees like a fool.</p><p>He dropped the monstrous ring on a table, and hundreds of pounds\u2019 worth of diamond clinked against a teacup.</p><p>\u201cI want to marry you, India.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his, steady and grave. \u201cWhy? Only yesterday you were courting Lala. You threw yourself into a carriage, by all accounts, trying to stop her marriage. Why are you proposing to me?\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s question resounded in his head. Why would she want to marry you? India was a jewel of a woman in a jewel-like setting that he presumed she\u2019d designed herself. She was surrounded by exquisite objects, the patina of age and wealth on every wall.</p><p>He might have been dressed like a bloody peacock to come to her, but it was all just show, covering up who he really was: more beast than man. They were beauty and the beast, the lady and the bastard. . . . It was stupid. Impossible.</p><p>But the warrior in him reared up. She was everything to him. All that he had thought mattered\u2014his factories, Vander, that damned house\u2014none of it mattered compared to her.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he stated, the raw note in his voice telling its own truth.</p><p>The air burned as India drew it into her lungs. At least Thorn was honest. He desired her. He didn\u2019t pretend to love her, or even declare that she was perfect, the way Lala had been. Her reaction must have shown on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about intimacies,\u201d he added. \u201cIn other ways.\u201d</p><p>Fury engulfed her and there was no stopping it, no telling herself to be adult and compose herself the way a lady should. \u201cThe hell you\u2019re not talking about intimacies,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou bedded me while you courted Lala. Now she\u2019s no longer free and, as you say, you want me. That\u2019s not good enough. I deserve better.\u201d</p><p>Finally, it was all clear in her head. Painful, but clear. \u201cI earned my own dowry,\u201d she told him. \u201cI told you why. Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, and she just kept going.</p><p>\u201cAdelaide wanted me to debut. Some man would undoubtedly have desired me enough to take me without a dowry: after all, he\u2019d get the daughter of a marquess, wouldn\u2019t he? Blue blood sells at a high premium. You know that, since you furnished Starberry Court for Lala.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off, feeling her fingernails digging into her palms. \u201cI earned my own dowry so I could buy freedom to choose the man myself rather than taking the first gentleman who held out his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake my hand,\u201d he said. His face could have been carved from stone. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether you have a dowry or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cEven though you\u2019re in the throes of this ridiculous competition with Vander, you haven\u2019t lied about that. You don\u2019t love me and you don\u2019t trust me, which is why you believed that I would give away my own child.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if her heart were breaking even saying the words aloud.</p><p>Thorn\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cYou are not thinking rationally, India. In fact, I think you are blaming me for the sins of your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with my parents!\u201d she cried. \u201cNothing! If you loved me, you would have come to me after Lady Rainsford made all those accusations, and you didn\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was chasing my own carriage, believing you and Vander were eloping in it.\u201d</p><p>His voice was so scathing that it took a moment to absorb his words\u2014and to understood why he\u2019d set out after the carriage. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d she cried wildly. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Thorn? Don\u2019t you see that? That\u2019s just more competition with Vander. You\u2019re offering this big diamond . . . but that\u2019s not what I want. I deserve better!\u201d</p><p>Thorn was listening, groping through the emotion boiling in India\u2019s voice, when he heard words he understood all too clearly: \u201cI deserve better.\u201d</p><p>Vander was right. Hell, she was right.</p> <p>\u201cI was good enough to bed,\u201d he snarled, \u201cbut not good enough to marry. Do I have you right, Lady Xenobia?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, India. I didn\u2019t want to marry someone like you. I wanted a pleasant relationship. I didn\u2019t want a woman who argues with me, who makes me so crazed with lust that I tumble her under the noses of the servants. Do you know what I felt when I thought you\u2019d run away with Vander?\u201d He was shouting now. \u201cDo you have any idea how I felt?\u201d</p><p>India would never be cowed, no matter how he shouted. She raised her chin defiantly. \u201cI know exactly what you felt: You felt that you were losing to Vander,\u201d she retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough for me.\u201d</p><p>A great coldness swept down over Thorn. She wanted better: who the hell was he to argue? \u201cThe fact is, India, the last thing I need is marriage to a daughter of a marquess who thinks she\u2019s above me, who wants better.\u201d The words came from some dark part of his soul, and they came with the force that only a bastard could give them.</p> <p>She stared at him, those beautiful eyes wide and strained. Her beauty hurt his gut, and his voice shifted from cold to lethal. \u201cIt would be rank stupidity to marry a woman who lied to me, told me she wasn\u2019t a virgin, told me she\u2019d give away her own child. You demonstrated precisely how much you respect me. Would you have lied to a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>She flinched as if he\u2019d hit her. He felt exhaustion coming over him like a shroud. India was . . . what she was. And he the same. That brief dream he\u2019d had\u2014of loving and marrying a woman like her\u2014would count as the greatest of his life\u2019s stupidities. No more.</p><p>India seemed frozen, her face white.</p><p>\u201cI bid you goodbye, Lady Xenobia,\u201d he said, falling back and bowing with a flourish. \u201cI think we have both said more than we would wish to and more than we ought. I was insane to think of marrying a woman of the titled class. I have no intention of considering it ever again, and I imagine our paths will not cross.\u201d</p><p>Caught in a storm of madness, he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He stepped toward her again and cradled her face in his hands. His soul wrenched with the time he\u2019d wasted, the ass he\u2019d been.</p><p>He bent, brushed his lips across hers with the respect that a lord would give a lady.</p> <p>Then he bowed and turned away again without meeting her eyes. There was no point.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p><p>Thorn had barely entered his front door before he started to curse himself for being a fool.</p><p>Despite everything he\u2019d said, he wanted India more than he wanted his dignity. She wouldn\u2019t lie to him again. Though he didn\u2019t give a damn if she did\u2014as long as she was in his house and bed, at his side.</p><p>Fred was manning the entry. \u201cGood morning, sir!\u201d</p><p>Thorn nodded, unable to summon a greeting.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rose\u2019s carriage arrived an hour or so ago,\u201d Fred said cheerfully. \u201cI believe that Clara plans to take her on a visit to Kensington Gardens this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Thorn managed, handing over his greatcoat.</p> <p>\u201cA Mr. Marley is waiting to see you, sir, accompanied by a Mr. Farthingale. Shall I send them into the library?\u201d</p><p>At first Thorn had no idea who Fred was talking about, but then he remembered: Marley was the Bow Street Runner he\u2019d hired to investigate the deaths of India\u2019s parents. Farthingale was presumably his partner.</p><p>It was bitterly ironic that the man had shown up at this particular moment. It hardly mattered now, but Thorn might as well hear what the man had uncovered.</p><p>Mr. Marley was an energetic young fellow, positively trembling with suppressed glee. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see you again, sir,\u201d he said to Thorn, giving him a brisk bow. He gestured to the elderly gentleman at his side, whose spindly legs and long nose gave him a distinct resemblance to a stork. \u201cThis is Mr. Farthingale, the proprietor of a jewelry shop in the Blackfriars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, gentlemen,\u201d Thorn said, bowing. \u201cWon\u2019t you both sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou engaged me to make inquiries on behalf of Lady Xenobia St. Clair regarding her father\u2019s death,\u201d Marley burst out.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Thorn said, ushering Mr. Farthingale to a settee.</p><p>\u201cThe Marquess of Renwick drove his curricle off the Blackfriars Bridge eleven years ago, in early 1788,\u201d Marley said once they were all seated. \u201cThat bit of reckless driving resulted in the untimely deaths of himself and the marchioness, though the horse was better able to fight the current, and kept his head above water until two lads on the bank were able to cut the reins.\u201d</p><p>Thorn remembered the Blackfriars current well; the marquess couldn\u2019t have picked a worse bridge to pitch over in all London.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to attempt to locate a valuable article of jewelry that the marquess may have had on his person,\u201d Marley continued. \u201cThe intervening years between the accident and your query made my investigation extremely difficult, but I decided to visit all the jewelry shops in the vicinity of the bridge. Mr. Farthingale\u2019s shop is just outside the liberty of Blackfriars.\u201d</p><p>The elderly jeweler cleared his throat and adjusted his old-fashioned pantaloons. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my news will not cheer Lady Xenobia,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cThe marquess and his wife apparently died within minutes of their visit to my establishment, a fact that virtually guarantees that the jewels are at the bottom of the Thames. I am not a great reader of the papers, and unfortunately I entirely missed the announcement of their death.\u201d</p><p>Thorn cursed under his breath. \u201cAm I to understand that the marquess had the jewels in his possession when he departed your shop?\u201d</p><p>This prompted an avalanche of detail; Mr. Farthingale had the sort of memory that a historian would envy. \u201cHis lordship placed the pouch containing the jewels in his coat pocket as he left,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI remember thinking that it was cavalier treatment of such valuable pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they, exactly?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Farthingale launched into a description of the pieces as if he\u2019d examined them only yesterday, rather than more than a decade earlier. \u201cA diamond demi-parure, consisting of a necklace and earrings set in engraved silver mounts with gold embellishment. The pieces constituted a substantial set, with hundreds of foil back rose-, table-, and Indian face-cut diamonds of various carats, shaped in flower heads and foliate spray motifs. I dated the pieces to the mid-1600s. I was prepared to pay a generous sum for the set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he meant to sell it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I informed the marquess, I would have been most happy to have it in my possession. But his lordship merely asked for a valuation. He never returned, and I put it completely out of my mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the two men left, Thorn sank back into his chair.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers had bought Eleanor a ring. But India could buy her own jewelry. What she needed was the faith that the man she married wouldn\u2019t leave her, as she believed her parents had done.</p><p>She would never have enough faith in him: he could imagine that she would test him over and over and he would fail every time, because, damn it, he was as blind as the next man.</p><p>India was brilliant and subtle. Her brain darted ahead, planning for eventualities only she could see. In that, he was her opposite. He dealt with problems of the moment, and never bothered to look much further.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t even know he was failing her. Yet India\u2019s conviction that she was unlovable \u2014and that Thorn didn\u2019t love her\u2014had far more to do with her parents than with him. Perhaps if he made love to her every\u2014</p><p>He stood up again, his mind reeling. He had just told himself that he planned to make love to India.</p><p>It was common terminology, after all. Though he never thought of sex that way: he used a rougher term for bedding a woman. Or more jovial ones. He shagged, pumped, screwed, jousted.</p><p>He never said anything about love, and he never thought it, either.</p><p>Until now.</p> <p>Finally he identified the emotion that gripped him the night he\u2019d thought India was on the point of marrying Vander. It wasn\u2019t possession or lust\u2014or at least, it wasn\u2019t only those emotions.</p><p>It was love. He loved her.</p><p>And yet India didn\u2019t believe he loved her. She never would . . . unless he took action.</p><p>He had to find those jewels and bring them to her.</p><p>He had to prove not only his own love for her, but her parents\u2019 love.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to gather the remaining lads together. Dusso was now a senior driver with the Royal Mail, and Thorn had to bribe the office handsomely to give their driver a week\u2019s leave. He ran down Geordie in the East End, wretchedly thin and evidently without a job. Bink had a family and lived in Kent on a tenant farm, but he didn\u2019t seem to be earning much; Thorn promptly offered him one of the farms attached to Starberry Court.</p> <p>When at last the four of them were together, Thorn explained what he wanted. \u201cA number of years ago, a carriage went off Blackfriars Bridge, and its two passengers drowned. A leather pouch holding jewels went missing. I want to find that pouch. You three are the only ones I would trust. Hell, I think we\u2019re probably the only men in London who have a chance of dragging it back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYer mugging us!\u201d Dusso exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cGiving us the piss,\u201d Geordie chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI assure you that I am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Dusso said. \u201cIffen I\u2019d known you was talking about the river, I wouldn\u2019t have come. I\u2019d rather be winding that bloody horn on the coach day and night than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred guineas for each of you,\u201d Thorn said, \u201cand five hundred for the man who finds the jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be like finding a pea,\u201d Geordie said, slumping in his chair. \u201cI dream about it at night, you know. Swimming down into the black, stinking water and fearing a dead man\u2019s claw is going to pull me down.\u201d</p><p>Bink scowled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you have the collywobbles if you\u2019re letting yourself think about it. I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said, squaring his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to it, mind. The wife complains because I work all day in the fields and still I don\u2019t want a drop of water near me after. But I\u2019ll do it for my girls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t possibly do it alone,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cI need a team, same as we used to do. Two to dive, and one person above to spot, make sure they both come up. One on the shore in case of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on the shore,\u201d Dusso said instantly. \u201cThem boats have no concern for who might be bobbing about in the stream.\u201d</p><p>Thorn shook his head. \u201cGeordie\u2019s on shore.\u201d</p><p>Dusso looked at Geordie\u2019s frail body and nodded. \u201cHow much are the joowels worth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, and it doesn\u2019t really matter. I want to give them to the woman I wish to marry. It was her parents who drowned. Their bodies were recovered but the jewels were not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStolen,\u201d Dusso said instantly. \u201cProbably the men as fished out the carriage are sleeping on beds of roses right now.\u201d</p><p>But Marley had bribed his way into the constabulary records.</p><p>\u201cI believe not,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cThe marquess visited a jeweler in the Blackfriars and went off the bridge minutes later. By the time they fished him out, the man was wearing only his breeches. The jewels were almost certainly lost in the river when his coat was dragged from his back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, you\u2019s talking of marrying the daughter of a bloody marquess?\u201d Dusso squawked.</p><p>The three men stared at Thorn, jaws a-cock. They\u2019d gotten used to the fact that Thorn had grown wealthy. They knew his father was a duke, and that he was always good for a sovereign or two. But this was different.</p><p>\u201cI am marrying her,\u201d Thorn said shortly.</p><p>\u201cBut is she marrying you?\u201d Geordie asked.</p><p>Dusso laughed. \u201cYeah, a lady agreeing to take on a by-blow? Not likely! No dog in a doublet for the likes of a lady!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always was a gundiguts,\u201d Bink snapped. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t she marry our lad? He\u2019s as good as any other Englishman.\u201d</p><p>Thorn intervened. \u201cShe\u2019ll marry me because I love her.\u201d He wanted to believe it.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you the cork-brained gay-lant,\u201d Dusso shouted. \u201cHe lurves her. Does she have chicken breasts or a bushel bubby? Has she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak of her in that manner,\u201d Thorn growled, bending forward.</p><p>Dusso nodded.</p><p>\u201cIffen you find these here jewels, will she take you?\u201d Geordie asked.</p><p>Thorn didn\u2019t answer. The truth was that he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll like him better if he\u2019s on his knees with a string of joowels in hand,\u201d Bink said practically.</p><p>Dusso put his elbows on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll help you. For old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want two hundred guineas,\u201d Bink stated. \u201cYou said it was only if we went in the water. Geordie here gets a hundred as well, even he don\u2019t put a pinkie in that river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred for each of you if we find the jewels,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cTwo hundred each otherwise, and that includes Geordie. There\u2019s many a time that the one on shore has saved everyone in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere ain\u2019t no joowels other than a crown as is worth fifteen hundred guineas,\u201d Dusso pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re worth it to me,\u201d Thorn stated.</p><p>\u201cI remember the Blackfriars Bridge,\u201d Geordie said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a nasty fast current around the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect it was that current that ripped off the marquess\u2019s clothing,\u201d Thorn confirmed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to find it in an hour,\u201d Bink said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have it out within the week,\u201d Thorn stated. \u201cWe could find anything in that damned river. We still can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow it like the back of me hand,\u201d Dusso bragged. \u201cReckon we can get it out today.\u201d</p><p>Bink looked nervous and cracked his knuckles. \u201cI ain\u2019t been in the river ever since.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence fell over the table.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t either,\u201d Thorn said.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Dusso looked astounded.</p><p>Thorn shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan on ever going back in either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a swell, ain\u2019t that right,\u201d Geordie said. \u201cNo need to swim.\u201d</p><p>Now there was a reason to swim. An hour later they were down by the water, all but Geordie stripped to their smalls.</p><p>Thorn had avoided the river for years, and the smell\u2014the fishy, murky odor of his childhood\u2014came back like a blow.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten the endless detritus of the river: branches, old clothes, dead rats, wine bottles . . . everything in London seemed to float down its largest tributary, swirling through eddies, scraping by rocks, floating alongside boats, dead goats, and mudlarks.</p><p>They clustered on the bank hard by the bridge, as close as possible to where the marquess\u2019s curricle had gone into the water. Thorn cast a critical eye at his gang. He\u2019d give his right arm to have Will with them; it was as if there was a silent patch of air that should hold Rose\u2019s father. Will would have made sure the marquess\u2019s jewels came up from the depths. \u201cYou sure you want to go in, Bink?\u201d</p> <p>Bink was thin but sinewy. He set his jaw. \u201cI ain\u2019t looking forward to it, but I\u2019ve got two daughters. I need that money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou all remember how the current fetches up against the bank and smashes into a rock,\u201d Thorn said, pointing at the curve. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t put your foot down in the mud, and watch your hands. Keep your gloves on. It\u2019ll make it harder to swim, but I want no sliced fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot me a nice teacup there once,\u201d shouted the irrepressible Dusso.</p><p>The sun was shining, but the Thames didn\u2019t reflect the sky\u2019s blue; it was liquid gray, the color of silt and debris.</p><p>\u201cExactly where\u2019d the currickle go in?\u201d Bink asked.</p><p>\u201cSee that newer length of brass there?\u201d Thorn said, pointing to a spot along the bridge\u2019s parapet.</p> <p>\u201cIf it went in there,\u201d Bink said, his eyes darting from bridge to water, \u201cshe would have swung about this way, my guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriver was thrown out when it hit the water,\u201d Dusso said. They were all focused now. They were, after all, the survivors of Grindel\u2019s cruel games. He used to throw a shoe in and make them learn the currents by fetching it\u2014or there\u2019d be no dinner.</p><p>They used to dive precisely into the spot where housemaids dumped the chamber pots and the kitchen staff dumped the scraps: you never knew when a silver spoon would end up in the mix.</p><p>\u201cI think the carriage landed here,\u201d Thorn said, pointing.</p><p>\u201cWife and he were caught in the current, along with the joowels. If he lost the bag around there, it would have fetched up on the curve,\u201d Dusso concluded.</p><p>\u201cInto the shit,\u201d Thorn began, but they all interrupted and shouted it together. \u201cInto the shit and bring out the bloody pig!\u201d It was Grindel\u2019s old call.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s hoping that hairy-arsed prigger is in a hot place,\u201d Bink said, crossing himself.</p><p>\u201cHe was an arse,\u201d Dusso shouted, jumping off the bank, white belly flashing in the sun.</p> <p>A moment later they were all bobbing at the edge. Thorn knew the river, at least this part of it, like the back of his hand. The pouch\u2019s weight would have sunk it in the silt, but not too deep, since the current was strong enough to keep the muck fairly shallow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous at the bend,\u201d he told his men. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone diving where the current cuts around that rock.\u201d The water took on a low whistle as it swept around the curve.</p><p>\u201cThere might be a pileup there,\u201d Bink objected. \u201cWill would have been down there first.\u201d</p><p>That was true: Rose\u2019s father had been a daredevil who always wanted to win more than he\u2019d cared to live. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth your life,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cYour daughters need you. Respect the river, Bink.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d learned that lesson the hard way. Their master, Grindel, had been evil; the river itself wasn\u2019t evil, but it was temperamental. One day it was tranquil and the next it was a demon dragging a man down to the bottom.</p><p>Bink grunted.</p><p>\u201cGeordie, keep an eye out,\u201d Thorn shouted, and Geordie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go down with Dusso; Bink, you stay above this time around.\u201d</p><p>Thorn took a deep breath, reckoned the exact spot on the bank he wanted to explore, and dove deep. The water roared past his ears, and the only reason he sensed the approaching bank was that a deeper dark loomed before him. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Bink\u2019s legs waving above like pale fish.</p><p>He felt along the muddy bank until he felt his lungs bursting, then kicked up and broke the surface. He got his bearings and realized that he hadn\u2019t searched the exact area he wanted.</p><p>Dusso surfaced just beside him. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I know where to go,\u201d he said, gasping. \u201cI\u2019ve put it all out of my mind and I can\u2019t seem to get too deep. My belly\u2019s in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook there,\u201d Thorn said, pointing to the spot he\u2019d picked out. \u201cI\u2019m going to swim over there. If you look up, you\u2019ll see my legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go down this time,\u201d Bink shouted.</p><p>Thorn fought his way through the current and caught the overhanging branch of an alder. \u201cBelow me,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>The two men disappeared, and for a moment the sun glinted on the surface of the water as if it were clean and serene.</p><p>Bink came back up, shook his head, took a gulp of air, and kicked his way back down again.</p><p>The afternoon passed like that. By the time they gave up, they reeked of the Thames, an noisome blend of fish, potatoes, coal smoke, and rain. It clung to their skin and soaked through their clothes and into the seats of Thorn\u2019s carriage.</p><p>At home, they bathed and dressed, and he introduced the lads to Rose. That evening, and the next, and the next after that passed as they spun tales of Will\u2019s bravery.</p><p>By the fourth day, they were all tired. They\u2019d gone down scores of times, but the pouch still eluded them. Only inherent stubbornness kept Thorn in the water. Bink and Dusso were diving, Geordie was on the bank, and Thorn was on the surface.</p><p>Thorn hung on to the alder branch, watching the water where the men disappeared. Damn it, he was wasting their time and his own. The bag was either at the curve, where it was worth a man\u2019s life to fish it out, or it had washed down the river and fetched up at one of a hundred different spots.</p><p>He was a fool. Eleven years is an eternity in the life of a river.</p><p>He missed India in a piercing way that shook him to the core. When he\u2019d offered her that diamond ring, he had been consumed with desire: he wanted her back. In his bed, in his arms.</p><p>But now he felt as if her absence had ripped him open and stabbed him in the heart. He didn\u2019t just love her the way a silly poet loved a maiden. He felt a primal, clawing need every time he thought of her.</p><p>It was mad. Or he was mad.</p><p>Abruptly he realized that Bink hadn\u2019t come back up. Dusso was bobbing near the bank. Damn it, his attention had wavered.</p><p>He was about to dive when Bink\u2019s head broke the water. The man seemed to have lost a stone in the last four days; his cheekbones jutted from his face. He splashed over to the alder and hung on to it, gasping harshly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thorn had stayed in fighting shape, but the rest of his gang hadn\u2019t. He made up his mind. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWe\u2019re done. No more. We gave it a good shot. We\u2019ve been up and down the bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bink shouted back. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up. I know where it is.\u201d He pointed directly to the turn in the river, the place where the water ran black and furious.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going there,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cOut of the water!\u201d</p><p>Dusso started splashing toward the bank, but Bink shook his head. \u201cI need that money!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was two hundred just for going in,\u201d Thorn said, treading water. \u201cCome on, mate. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t taken no charity in my life,\u201d Bink said, his jaw setting. \u201cAnd I ain\u2019t going to start now. I\u2019m going after that damn bag.\u201d And with that he let go of the branch and began plowing through the water toward the bend.</p><p>Thorn shouted, knowing Bink wouldn\u2019t hear him\u2014or listen, if he did. Dusso howled something from the bank and Thorn started out to swim, planning to drag Bink back to the bank by force if necessary.</p><p>But the man had a good start, and even though Thorn slashed through the water as if it were air, Bink had disappeared below the surface by the time Thorn arrived at the river\u2019s bend.</p><p>He followed the pale flash of legs down through the murk. Bink was no fool: he was using the current to propel himself against the bank, his gloved hands outstretched to bounce off the looming rock, pushing him lower to a pileup of silt that likely included everything from dead rats to broken crockery.</p> <p>A stream of curses went through Thorn\u2019s mind. What in the hell had he been doing, putting his lads at risk? One wrong move and Bink would be swept sideways, straight into the rock that the water was smashing into with a throbbing roar.</p><p>With a powerful kick, Thorn reached Bink, grabbed his arm, and hauled him up.</p><p>They broke the surface, both gasping. Bink brought his hand up to the air. It was clutching a slimy, moldering leather hat; he shook it and let it fall. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he shouted. \u201cThe place is ripe. The pouch is there, I tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn. If I hadn\u2019t grabbed you, you\u2019d have been driven into the rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you did,\u201d Bink said defiantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d A thin red rivulet trailed down Bink\u2019s cheek.</p> <p>\u201cA flea bite. I\u2019m going down again. I\u2019m going to get that damn pouch. You\u2019ll marry the bloody marquess or his daughter, and I\u2019ll earn me reward.\u201d And with that, he slipped beneath the water again.</p><p>Thorn swore, and dove. Bink was like a fish. With a grim curse, Thorn swam after, eyes straining to see through the murk. The water was full of silt cast up by Bink\u2019s first attempt.</p><p>This was the Thames at its worst, black as soot, with a current that clutched with a hundred fingers, no matter how agile the swimmer, seeming to purposefully drive him against a shard of rock or a broken bottle, each perilous in its own way.</p><p>The heel of Bink\u2019s foot flashed ahead like a fish scale. He was precisely where Thorn had decided the bag had likely lodged, if it was there at all: under the shadow of the rock that the current had cut into, leaving the great bulk hanging above them like a black shelf.</p><p>With almost no oxygen left in his lungs, Thorn reached Bink, only to see his body jerk in the way of a man who is trying to tug something free. He was making silt explode into the water, clouds of sediment spreading as fast as smoke.</p><p>Thorn swam blindly toward the place where he\u2019d seen Bink\u2019s heel. His hand closed on a slick leg, and he felt forward. If a man is caught in spirals of fishing line, tugging could tighten it, trapping the swimmer until, panicked, he choked on sludge-laden water.</p><p>Bink knew that as well as he did, and yet he still pulled. Thorn joined in, pulling with every bit of remaining strength he had. Bink lurched backward, kicking madly.</p><p>His foot caught the edge of Thorn\u2019s thigh and flipped him as easily it might a fish. In that instant the current caught Thorn in a rush of bubbles, turned him over, his vision gone, air gone, and slammed him against the rock. Water rushed to fill his mouth, swept into his lungs.</p> <p>The world was already black, but the rush of bubbles in his ears stopped, and everything went silent and cold.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>In years to come, India never forgot the moment when Fred burst through the door of her sitting room, Adelaide\u2019s butler at his heels. \u201cHe\u2019s dying, m\u2019lady,\u201d he gasped. \u201cAnd the little girl wants you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Fred\u2019s words just knocked about in her head like the lyrics of a song she heard recited but never sung.</p><p>Dying? How on earth could Thorn be dying? But the fear etched on Fred\u2019s face told her that he was not exaggerating.</p><p>She sprang from her chair and ran to Thorn\u2019s carriage without her pelisse, without her reticule, without Adelaide.</p><p>Fred leapt on and the carriage rocked around the corner. India sat, her nails biting into her palms. Her mind turned into a snowstorm, so white and violent that no single thought made it through, nothing besides the beating of her heart. Each beat was a prayer, a cry, a plea.</p><p>Thorn couldn\u2019t die. The world would be nothing without him. She couldn\u2019t imagine it: her heart rejected the idea.</p><p>The pain was like a drumbeat marking the minutes.</p><p>As the carriage rocked to a halt in front of the house, India leapt out and ran up the path and through the door, past the silent butler, up the stairs, straight to Thorn\u2019s chamber. A doctor was bending over the bed.</p><p>When she saw Thorn, her knees gave way and she barely caught herself on the bedpost. He was naked, covered below his waist by a sheet. His skin had lost all color; he was white, a powder-white that wasn\u2019t right. His lashes were black as coal against the pallor of his cheeks.</p><p>Even worse, a huge gash stretched across his forehead. She watched the doctor make another neat, precise stitch, working to close the gaping wound. Blood was running down from the man\u2019s hands, soaking into the pillows.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d she said, her voice gasping. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dautry?\u201d the doctor said, not lifting his eyes. \u201cHe still lives.\u201d He took another stitch, and another.</p><p>\u201cAre there other injuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you count drowning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was pulled from the Thames, as I understand it. It\u2019s a miracle those men got him breathing again. But he hasn\u2019t come out of it. He should have returned to his senses by now. Could be damage to the lungs. Or brain concussion from the blow.\u201d More blood oozed over the doctor\u2019s hand, and a woman, likely Thorn\u2019s housekeeper, moved forward with a wad of damp cloth.</p><p>The world snapped back into focus, and India grabbed her wrist. \u201cIs that towel clean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do the washing on Monday,\u201d she answered, her chin wobbling. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a day or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take it, if you please,\u201d India said, softening when she saw the housekeeper\u2019s red eyes and the tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Stella,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lady Xenobia. I\u2019d be grateful if you could bring me a stack of pristine, unused cloths. Put in an order for ice to be delivered every day for the next week. I also want to make up a poultice of eggs, oil of roses, and turpentine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took the cloth and wiped the blood from Thorn\u2019s face and neck, carefully avoiding the wound itself.</p><p>The doctor glanced up. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t return to himself, you\u2019ll have no need to treat the wound or ward off fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will wake up,\u201d India said flatly.</p><p>The man grunted, finished the last stitch, and cut off the string with a small knife. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can do,\u201d he said, wiping his hands with the edge of the sheet. \u201cEither he\u2019ll wake or he won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere must be some treatment for head wounds of this nature,\u201d India said, eyeing the doctor.

What\u2019s Mr. Dautry\u2019s man\u2019s name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Pendle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease ask Pendle to lay out clean sheets and night clothing, as well as warm water. Mrs. Stella is bringing clean cloths. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll go to Miss Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the nursery,\u201d Fred said. He hesitated and said, \u201cIt was Miss Rose who insisted that we send a carriage for you, my lady. I hope that was the right thing to do. There was such a commotion when he was brought home that she heard it in the nursery. The duke and duchess are at their country house, so I sent a message to you. And, of course, to the duke as well, but his seat is two days away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were absolutely correct to call me,\u201d India reassured him. \u201cI\u2019ve sat in many a sickroom. Will you please send a messenger to Lady Adelaide to inform her of the circumstances? And where are the men who pulled Mr. Dautry from the river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessrs. Bink, Dusso, and Geordie are bathing and changing their clothes.\u201d</p><p>India frowned. \u201cWho are these men? Do you mean to say that they are in residence here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are former mudlarks,\u201d Fred said, \u201cand very proud of it too. They\u2019re the ones who saved Mr. Dautry. By all accounts, they got him breathing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will thank them later,\u201d India said. At the moment she had to visit Rose.</p> <p>When she reached the nursery, she found the child listening as her tutor read aloud from a history of ancient Rome. Rose sat on a straight-backed chair, Antigone perched on the rocking cow beside her.</p><p>As India entered, Twink\u2019s voice broke off. Rose pulled Antigone from the cow and stood, clutching her doll tightly in her arms. The tutor came to his feet and bowed. In the corner, Clara bobbed a curtsy.</p><p>\u201cMr. Dautry is alive,\u201d India said quickly. \u201cThe doctor just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he woken up?\u201d Rose\u2019s voice was tight and high.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d India went to her and knelt down. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be well, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said that about my father as well,\u201d Rose said.</p><p>\u201cMay I pick you up?\u201d India asked.</p><p>Rose nodded. India scooped her into her arms, carried her over to the sofa, and sat down. The little girl remained bolt upright on India\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that you sent a carriage for me,\u201d India said, stroking her back.</p><p>\u201cLady Adelaide said that you work miracles,\u201d Rose reminded her.</p><p>This hadn\u2019t been what Adelaide was referring to, but India nodded. \u201cIf there is a miracle to be had, I shall do it,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI promise you that. And if that miracle doesn\u2019t happen\u201d\u2014India forced the words out because they had to be said; she could not leave the child in the grip of utter terror\u2014\u201cif Thorn is lost to us, Rose, you will come and live with me.\u201d</p><p>India felt Rose shudder. \u201cI shall probably be sent to America, to my aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what Thorn would have wanted\u2014wants. He wants you to live here in England. And remember? I announced to half the world that you are my daughter.\u201d India\u2019s arms closed tighter, and she coaxed Rose back against her shoulder. \u201cI can think of no greater privilege than that.\u201d</p><p>Rose made a little gasping sound, but said nothing. Still, her body relaxed in the circle of India\u2019s arms, and her head sank against her shoulder. \u201cHe won\u2019t die, will he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>India put her cheek against Rose\u2019s bright hair and rocked her back and forth. \u201cHow is Antigone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not feeling very well,\u201d Rose whispered. \u201cShe feels sick, as if she swallowed river water too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must soothe her.\u201d India put the child on her feet and looked into her eyes. \u201cTell Antigone that she is loved, and that she will be safe and warm. Tell her that Thorn would want her to be hopeful and never give up, because he isn\u2019t the sort of man who gives up, is he?\u201d</p><p>Rose shook her head. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d India said. \u201cI will not give up on Thorn, and neither will you. Now I\u2019m going to return to him and put a poultice on his forehead. If you are worried and want to know how he is, just send Clara to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give up either,\u201d Rose said stoutly.</p><p>India gave her a hug and ran out the door.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>By the time India returned to Thorn\u2019s bedchamber, she felt calm again. She was at her best in a crisis, when others fell into hysterics. She stopped to introduce herself to Thorn\u2019s butler, who was clearly beside himself with worry.</p><p>Between the two of them, they made certain that every member of the household had work to do, from Mrs. Stella to the grooms, who could work scrubbing river water from the carriage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet the mudlarks tonight, my lady,\u201d the butler said. \u201cThey just left for Cheapside to find a patent medicine that Mr. Dusso knows of.\u201d</p><p>What on earth had Thorn been up to? Could it be an odd reunion, where the four of them plunged back into the river and revisited their childhood? But she had no time to chat; she hurried back to Thorn\u2019s bedroom and shooed out his valet, who had changed the sheets but not yet bathed his master.</p><p>She talked constantly as she dipped a clean cloth in warm water and began to wash Thorn. She told him how much she had missed him, and was missing him now. She might have cried a bit, especially when she pulled back the sheet in order to wash his legs and feet. She had never clearly seen all the scars that covered his legs, the pale slashes that cut through a rough covering of hair without disguising the muscle that lay underneath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His manhood lay against his leg, looking entirely different than it always had been in her presence. Like him, it was suspended in time.</p><p>India kept talking as she washed, softly telling Thorn stories of the more extraordinary households she\u2019d seen.</p><p>Every so often she would stop and ladle a spoonful of water into his mouth, holding his head up so that some of it ran down his throat.</p><p>Just as she drew the sheet back to his waist, there was a tap at the door and Mrs. Stella appeared, followed by a footman with more hot water. She was clearly restored to her efficient self. \u201cI ordered the ingredients you wanted, and I have Rose and Clara supervising as Cook bakes a special cake for the master.\u201d</p> <p>India smiled at her. \u201cWhat a splendid idea. Thank you, Mrs. Stella.\u201d</p><p>When the door was shut again, India turned her attention to Thorn\u2019s hair. Blood and river water had dried it into a stiff helmet, so she washed it over and over. All the time she kept speaking to him in a low, soothing voice, though she occasionally stopped and begged him to wake up.</p><p>By the time she was satisfied that he was clean, the bed was completely soaked. She pulled the bell and supervised as footmen moved him into the connecting bedchamber, the one meant for the lady of the house. The irony of that did not escape her.</p><p>The evening wore on; the butler appeared and asked if she would like to join Messrs. Dusso, Bink, and Geordie for the meal. She declined, but stepped from the room to greet the gentlemen.</p><p>Mr. Bink pressed a brown bottle into her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s Edison\u2019s Magno-Electric Vitalizer,\u201d he told her earnestly. \u201cThe best stuff in London. It\u2019ll jolt him right awake. And if that doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll find some of them tablets they make for rousing one\u2019s manhood. That\u2019ll do it!\u201d</p> <p>India thanked him and hurried back to Thorn\u2019s bedside. Something deep inside her believed that by talking she was mooring him to Earth, and that if she gave up and left him to silence, he might just drift away.</p><p>Late that night, exhausted, she began to slur her words and finally broke into tears.</p><p>She hated to cry. She had learned as a child that crying did nothing. You could cry for hours, but the house would still be dark and echoing when you stopped. Crying didn\u2019t make you warmer, or less hungry.</p><p>But now the emotion welled up in her throat and she couldn\u2019t stop. When she got enough control to speak again, the words that came were no longer soft and soothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014why did you go into the river?\u201d she demanded, her voice cracking. \u201cYou should never have risked your life when your father and Eleanor love you, when Rose loves you . . . when I love you!\u201d</p><p>She choked again, appalled to find that she was almost shouting at him, when she should be coaxing him back to consciousness with loving kindness. But she\u2019d used up all of the tender words she had.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said again, her voice breaking on a sob, \u201cbut I hate you too, because this is the first time I told you so, and you aren\u2019t even listening. I hate you for making me fall in love with you. I hate you for wanting to marry someone sweet and fluffy as a duckling instead of me.\u201d</p><p>The worst of it was her own role in the drama: she had thrown away the only beautiful thing in her life. Even if Thorn wasn\u2019t dying, he was finished with her. And he did deserve better than she.</p><p>She had lied to him in their most intimate moments. She had never truly trusted him with her most valuable truths: not with the fact she had never been with a man, nor with the fact that she, of all people, would never desert a child.</p><p>Loving him was an anguish that she felt in her entire body, as if two of her bones were grating against each other.</p><p>\u201cYou broke my heart,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou broke\u2014you broke my heart!\u201d</p><p>To her utter horror, she realized that she was emphasizing her points by pounding on his chest. Not hard enough to hurt, but still, it was a sign of what an awful person she was.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not sw-sweet,\u201d she cried, tears splashing on the sheet. \u201cI suppose I lost all my sweetness when I was a child. But that doesn\u2019t mean that love doesn\u2019t hurt just as much. It doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t need taking care of, as Lala does. Just because I am able to take care of myself doesn\u2019t mean that I want to!\u201d And with that, she sank down, her face on his chest, her body shaking with sobs.</p><p>She was weeping so hard that she scarcely heard a voice whisper, \u201cIndia.\u201d</p> <p>But she did hear it.</p><p>She reared up, saw Thorn\u2019s eyes were open, and screamed. \u201cI love you,\u201d she cried, her voice rough with tears. \u201cOh Thorn, I\u2019ve been so frightened. But you came back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hear you yelling, and after a while it seemed easier to open my eyes.\u201d His voice was hoarse, but the corners of his lips curled up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to lose my temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d he said, his fingers curling around hers, eyes drifting shut again. \u201cLove you.\u201d His eyelashes lay on his cheeks again, but this time she knew he had been caught by sleep, and not something darker and nearer to death.</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>The next day India left Thorn\u2019s side only to bathe and dress, and to see Rose just long enough to reassure her that her guardian was on the mend. Adelaide brought over clothing and wisely said nothing about the fact that even if Lady Rainsford kept her mouth shut about what happened at Starberry, India had now indisputably ruined her reputation, at least among the members of Thorn\u2019s household.</p><p>After tea, Adelaide poked her head in the door and announced that she was taking Rose on a trip to Hyde Park, and that Thorn\u2019s former mudlarks were a good group of men. Apparently they had saved his life by pounding on his chest until he threw up all the water he\u2019d swallowed.</p><p>India scarcely listened. She was worried. Thorn hadn\u2019t woken again. She could rouse him enough to drink water, but he seemed dazed and said nothing.</p><p>By now she had given up all pretense that she wasn\u2019t acting precisely as a wife would. She spent the day hanging over Thorn\u2019s bed, talking to him, coaxing him, haranguing him, bathing him.</p><p>As evening fell, she stripped to her chemise, lay down beside him, and put her head on his shoulder. Fear that he would never truly come back to life was growing in her heart.</p><p>She lay beside him for hours, fear steeling her limbs as if a stranger had taken over her body. Finally she fell asleep with her arm tight around his middle, as if she could hold him to this earth by touch alone.</p><p>When a warm mouth brushed hers, sliding off to caress her cheek, she just curled up, thinking she was dreaming.</p><p>But sometime later her eyes popped open and she found Thorn beside her, propped on his side. He had lost weight, which had only chiseled the dangerous male beauty that moved her as had no other man\u2019s. There was nothing dangerous about the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, the simple words dropping in the silence. \u201cGod in heaven, India. You saved my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mudlarks did that,\u201d she said, her eyes filling. After a lifetime of suppressing tears, she had turned into a watering can. \u201cThorn,\u201d she whispered, unable to say anything else.</p><p>He rolled partly on top of her. \u201cIndia,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>She brought a hand up to touch his face. \u201cYour hair is damp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you tried to wake me by yelling,\u201d he told her, eyes laughing. \u201cBut in the end, very unromantically, I woke because I needed a chamber pot. You were fast asleep, so I went through to my own bedchamber, where my man was rather shocked to see me walk through the door. I just had a quick bath.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must eat!\u201d she said, wiggling to get free of his weight.</p><p>But he pushed forward one of his legs, trapping her more firmly beneath him. \u201cFred will bring breakfast any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be starving,\u201d India said, her breath catching at his expression. \u201cYou must regain your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace, my little whirlwind,\u201d he said, lowering his head enough to brush her lips with his again. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want far more than an egg.\u201d</p> <p>She stilled, her heart melting.</p><p>Their kiss made up for days of fear. It was a heart-piercing kiss that seared promises into the bone.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d Thorn said fiercely, raising his head.</p><p>Another kiss, but India pulled back when it turned slow and erotic. \u201cYou must eat,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He pushed her hair back from her forehead. \u201cHave I told you how much I love you?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips trembled. \u201cWhat if you only love me because I rushed to your side, like the mother you never knew? Or because Vander claimed to marry me?\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s hand cupped her cheek. \u201cOh ye of little faith,\u201d he said, giving her lips a tiny bite. \u201cI loved you before Vander arrived at the house; I simply didn\u2019t realize it. I think I probably fell in love with you the moment you told me I had a shortfall.\u201d His eyes gleamed with amusement.</p><p>India did not laugh. \u201cBut you want to marry a woman like Lala. I can understand. I truly can. I know I\u2019m not sweet.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s hands gripped her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t ever say that again, India. You are sweet\u2014but you\u2019re much more. You\u2019re the other half of my heart, and there\u2019s nothing docile and childlike inside me. It\u2019s not what I want in my wife, my partner.\u201d</p><p>India managed a wobbly smile.</p><p>\u201cI almost came back within five minutes of leaving you, but I wanted to bring you a gift when I next returned,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cIt was idiotic, and you can tell me that every day of my life. I had talked myself into believing that I could not come to you again without this.\u201d He reached over and took a purple velvet pouch from the bedside table that hadn\u2019t been there when India had lain down to sleep beside him the night before.</p> <p>Velvet pouches rarely, if ever, contained anything other than jewelry, but like the diamond ring, she didn\u2019t care. She wanted more than gems. She wanted him, his heart . . . his promise. She didn\u2019t take her eyes from his. \u201cAre you saying that you\u2014you planned to come back to me, even after . . . even after I told you that I deserved better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said, his voice deep and true.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, her voice cracking, \u201cyou deserve better than me, Thorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no one better than you. You were made for me,\u201d he said. The pouch fell to the side as he drew India into his arms, devouring her, convincing her without words that he had no interest in another woman.</p><p>Minutes\u2014or hours\u2014later India heard a noise in the corridor and flew off the bed, pulling on her wrapper to welcome Fred, who was carrying a laden tray. Then she climbed back on the bed and sank back in front of Thorn, uncovering the dishes.</p><p>\u201cStart with this,\u201d she said, holding out a piece of fruit. \u201cYou must start slowly. You had no nourishment for two whole days.\u201d Thorn ate it, mock-nipping at her fingers. But she ignored him until he had put away two eggs and three toast fingers dripping with butter, and drunk a nourishing cup of broth.</p><p>Only when she was satisfied that he had eaten enough for the moment did she send the plates away and curl up beside him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d Thorn asked. Contrary to every expectation, he looked bright-eyed and energetic.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not leaving this bed,\u201d she said severely. \u201cYou must rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will stay in bed if you stay with me,\u201d he said, giving her a devilish grin.</p><p>\u201cNone of that! Your body has endured a terrible shock.\u201d</p><p>His smile deepened and he picked up her hand, placing it below his waist. \u201cDoes it seem to you that my body is tired?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled instinctively around that vital, male part of him. \u201cYou should be tired,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping for two days. There are things I need more than sleep.\u201d</p><p>India felt color rising in her cheeks. \u201cThis is\u2014we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She pulled her hand away, rather reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWhether we should or shouldn\u2019t is irrelevant,\u201d Thorn stated. \u201cYou are mine, India, and you are going to be my wife, just as soon as I can get another special license.\u201d</p><p>Joy filled her heart, but she laughed. \u201cIs this your third proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should be on my knees,\u201d Thorn said, his fingers weaving through her hair. \u201cBut that would mean I\u2019d have to move. And I don\u2019t want to leave this bed.\u201d</p><p>She looped her arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019ll pretend you\u2019re on your knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, Lady Xenobia India St. Clair, may I have the honor of your hand in marriage?\u201d</p><p>Tears fell down her cheeks. Xenobia India St. Clair was rarely speechless, but emotion caught her throat and she couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t answer, because you\u2019ve already said yes,\u201d he said, his lips brushing hers tenderly.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time you smiled at me, it was a yes. And when you arrived here determined to save my life, that was another yes. And when you shouted at me, and forced me to wake up, that was a third yes.\u201d</p><p>The love deep in his eyes threatened to overwhelm her, and their lips met in a kiss that was irrational in its passion, sinful in its sensuality, raw in its pleasure.</p><p>Sometime later, India\u2019s robe fell off the bed to the floor and her chemise tore down the middle, the remnants tossed aside. When Thorn\u2019s scarred body met hers, she felt as if her heart danced in her rib cage, pounding to a tempo that only the two of them knew.</p><p>No one would have believed that mere hours before, Thorn had lain caught in dreamless sleep. He was all tongue and bites and strokes of his hand that drove India from pleasure to pleasure until they were both shuddering, and broken pleas tumbled from her lips. His touch made her head fall back and her mind whirl into a shameless, sensual storm of feeling.</p><p>Finally, finally, Thorn poised himself above her. \u201cI think I would like you to say yes just one more time,\u201d he whispered, lips just above hers. \u201cWill you be mine, India? Will you keep me, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, as long as we both shall live?\u201d</p><p>One tear ran down India\u2019s cheek from the pure beauty of it. \u201cIn sickness and in health,\u201d she repeated, her voice husky, \u201cforsaking all others, as long as we both shall live.\u201d</p><p>Then he claimed her with a single thrust.</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>Quite some time later, Thorn returned the velvet bag to India\u2019s lap, insisting that she humor him and open it.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s necklace and earrings fell into her lap. The settings were tarnished, but there was a flash of diamond, the gleam of old gold. . . .</p><p>India\u2019s hands flew to her mouth, and a little scream broke from her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you\u2014\u201d She turned to him, horrified. \u201cYou risked your life to salvage my mother\u2019s jewels for me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut you hate the river, Thorn. And look what happened: it nearly killed you.\u201d Her hand brushed back his hair, caressing the wound that would remain on his brow, a permanent gift of the river. \u201cNo jewelry is worth your life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents loved you, just as I love you,\u201d Thorn told her. \u201cThey weren\u2019t leaving you, just as I will never leave you. I shall prove it to you this very afternoon.\u201d</p><p>India was completely confused. \u201cHow could you possibly prove that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou believe yourself to be unlovable,\u201d Thorn said, ignoring her question, \u201cbut I was in love with you after five minutes in your company, and Vander was only ten minutes behind me. All those men who asked to marry you\u2014the ones you say wanted to marry you for your title\u2014they were in love with you too. Not to mention the stonemasons, and painters, and the rest of the men whose hearts you stripped bare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI did the same thing as you,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to keep you in your place, even to drive you away, because I could not believe that you would love a mudlark and a bastard.\u201d His voice was raw with emotion.</p> <p>A hot flush washed over India, a wave of feeling so deep that she could hardly put it in words. \u201cYou humble me,\u201d she said, stumbling into speech. \u201cYou make me\u2014\u201d</p><p>The stones tumbled off the bed. No one noticed.</p><p>Later that day, a polite man by the name of Mr. Farthingale appeared in Thorn\u2019s library and explained to India and Adelaide that he was a jeweler who had met, years ago, with the Marquess of Renwick.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d India said, clasping Thorn\u2019s hand very tightly.</p><p>\u201cI know your shop quite well,\u201d Adelaide said brightly. \u201cJust off Blackfriars, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, my lady,\u201d Mr. Farthingale said, inclining his head. Then he gave India a kindly look and said, \u201cLady Xenobia, I understand that you wish to know more of my encounter with your father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I would,\u201d she managed, her heart thumping.</p><p>\u201cHis lordship was in possession of a diamond demi-parure, which had descended through his wife\u2019s family. He asked me to value the pieces, as he was considering sale.\u201d</p><p>India didn\u2019t know what to think, so she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThe marquess and the marchioness were considering the sale in order to fund their daughter\u2019s debut and dowry.\u201d Mr. Farthingale paused delicately.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d India whispered.</p><p>\u201cThere was a reason your parents didn\u2019t immediately sell the jewelry to Mr. Farthingale,\u201d Thorn said, smiling at her.</p><p>Mr. Farthingale inclined his head, his eyes compassionate. \u201cI believe they would have eventually consigned the pieces to me, but they wished to consult with their daughter, that is, with you, Lady Xenobia, before doing so.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, India rose to say goodbye, feeling lightheaded, as if her head were filled with air. Her parents hadn\u2019t been running away from her. They had loved her. They had been thinking of her future.</p> <p>\u201cYour news was very welcome,\u201d she told Mr. Farthingale.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever wish to sell the pieces . . .\u201d he murmured, bowing.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Thorn intervened before India could say the same.</p><p>The pieces were her only tangible tie to her mother and father, and they represented all that Thorn had given her . . . and that which he had almost lost for her.</p><p>After they made love that night, India curled against Thorn\u2019s side, staring into the darkness, allowing herself to remember her parents.</p><p>Her mother used to throw back her hair and laugh in a deep-throated, joyful way. Her father wasn\u2019t much good at being a gentleman, or managing an estate, but she recalled how he\u2019d sat with her for hours, helping her arrange glass tiles in just the right order. He taught her the skills that allowed her to make any room into an enchanting oasis.</p><p>She even remembered the way her mother would laugh and say, \u201cI knew you would work it out, poppet,\u201d when India went to find them to say that she\u2019d succeeded in locating a chicken for supper, or had made mushroom soup.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s cheerful confidence had pushed her to learn how to bake bread, how to apply stucco, how to polish silver.</p><p>Her parents had been the wind at her back in every house she had reorganized and refurbished, and she had never thanked them, or even realized it.</p><p>Thorn had given her parents back to her. They hadn\u2019t been conventional, or particularly aristocratic, and certainly not protective. But they had loved her.</p><p>The following evening, Messrs. Bink, Dusso, and Geordie had the singular experience of dining at the grand home of a duke and duchess, who were deeply grateful to them for saving the life of their eldest son.</p><p>Not only were they seated across from the Duke and Duchess of Villiers, but another future duke, Lord Brody, had also joined the meal. News of Thorn\u2019s near demise had spread through London, and Vander had turned up, as he said, \u201cbecause he knew that Thorn\u2019s head was harder than a rock but he wanted to see for himself.\u201d</p><p>All that nobility at one table meant that Geordie, in particular, had trouble shaping a single word until Villiers\u2019s butler took pity on them and brought tankards of ale to the table.</p><p>Thorn grinned at his father, who fastidiously declined the ale; his stepmother, who not only accepted it, but was drinking it with every sign of enjoyment; his closest friend, who had accepted defeat with utmost grace; and finally at the woman who would soon be his wife.</p><p>Earlier that afternoon the archbishop had reluctantly given Thorn\u2019s solicitor yet another special license\u2014this one not blank but specifying the union of Mr. Tobias Dautry to Lady Xenobia India St. Clair.</p><p>They would be married in the morning, the ceremony witnessed by a duke and duchess, and three members of the fraternity of mudlarks. Evander Brody, heir to the Duke of Pindar, would stand as Thorn\u2019s best man, even though he was laughingly offering the bride a last chance to become a duchess.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Thorn growled, pulling his fianc\u00e9e close in an entirely improper manner and bending his head to drop a kiss on a neck that glittered with diamonds . . . restored through Mr. Farthingale\u2019s expert ministrations.</p><p>\u201cThose joowels looked like rubbish when Bink fished them up,\u201d Dusso told the Duke of Villiers. \u201cI\u2019d never know they was the same, now they\u2019re cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Dusso grinned, and so did Bink and Geordie. They\u2019d been in the Thames, and it hadn\u2019t conquered them.</p><p>Thorn felt the same. The river had almost killed him, but it had brought him India, and that was worth everything. If he hadn\u2019t been a mudlark, he never would have become the man whom India wanted.</p><p>He held her hand tightly under the table.</p><p>With a wicked little smile playing around his mouth, the Duke of Villiers began telling India about why he\u2019d sent Thorn off to Piggleston. \u201cI thought that Tobias needed to be made to understand how much he loved you.\u201d He raised his heavy-lidded eyes and glanced at his own wife. \u201cHe is my son, after all. We\u2019re fools when it comes to women.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor bent near, her hair brushing the duke\u2019s magnificently clad shoulder. \u201cMy husband was playing Cupid,\u201d she said. \u201cHe likes to do that.\u201d</p><p>India laughed, and Thorn thought, once again, that he could spend his life listening to this woman, this particular woman, laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The night he\u2019d waited in Piggleston, believing India had been on the eve of marrying Vander, had scored him to the heart. But his father wasn\u2019t wrong: it had also taught him what he most wanted.</p><p>Not just what he wanted, but the only thing that was important in life.</p><p>Under the table, he tightened his hand around India\u2019s. Then he remembered that he wasn\u2019t a gentleman\u2014he was a mudlark, sitting at a table with three other mudlarks.</p><p>He caught India\u2019s face in both his hands and kissed her.

When are you and Mama coming home? Rose has been perfectly horrid to me all day. She says that now she\u2019s 14, she shan\u2019t play with me any longer. She hurt my feelings, and I did something bad, and now Mr. Twink says I have to write to you and confess. I want to say first that I\u2019m not sorry, because she should have read me a story when I asked, and besides, she doesn\u2019t play with Antigone anymore.</p><p>I cut a little bit of Antigone\u2019s hair.</p><p>Please come home now. You\u2019ve been gone for years.</p> <p>Adelaide</p><p>From Miss Rose Summers at Starberry Court, to her guardians at 40 Hanover Square, London</p><p>Dear India,</p><p>I know you left only two days ago, but we\u2019ve descended to the level of animals here, and civilization is but a dim memory. Remember when we visited Italy, and Papa read aloud The Inferno? That\u2019s what Starberry Court is like at the moment. I know you will say that Addie inherited her temper from you, but there is no excuse for this: She cut Antigone\u2019s hair short in the front! You know how I feel about Antigone. And now my poor dear has shorn hair and looks like a fever victim.</p><p>How can you both spend so much time at Starberry Court? I am positively dying of ennui. I have finished my study of Heraclitus and Xenophanes, but Twink can scarcely have a philosophical conversation when he\u2019s busy chasing after Addie. I truly think she should have a governess, as should Peter. For myself, I am counting the days until I can return to school.</p><p>Please arrange for the baby to be born tomorrow, as I should like to share a birthday.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Rose</p> <p>From Master Peter Dautry at Starberry Court,</p><p>to his parents at 40 Hanover Square, London</p><p>Dear Mama,</p><p>Mister Twink says I shud rite but I don\u2019t like riting.</p><p>Peter</p><p>From Mr. Dautry at 40 Hanover Square, London to his butler at Starberry Court</p><p>Fred,</p><p>Thank you for sending on the children\u2019s letters. Please inform our irritating offspring that babies arrive on their own schedule, and their mama and I will return to Starberry Court just as soon as their new sister or brother chooses to make an appearance.</p><p>Dautry</p><p>Daybreak</p><p>Margot is perfect,\u201d India whispered, one finger tracing her newborn daughter\u2019s winged eyebrows. \u201cAnd she\u2019s so calm! I suspect she will be a better sleeper than Addie or Peter. Rember how Peter bawled?\u201d The infant had opened her eyes just long enough to reveal that they were gray, like her father\u2019s, and had promptly fallen to sleep again.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it.\u201d Thorn was measuring one of the baby\u2019s tiny feet against his thumb. \u201cI suppose Peter and Addie were once this small, but it doesn\u2019t seem possible. Rose is almost at my shoulder, and yet fourteen years ago her feet must have been this size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she was already reading,\u201d India reminded Thorn with a choke of laughter. It had become a family joke that Rose claimed to have been reading \u201cever since I was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargot, do you already know how to read?\u201d her father asked the baby.</p><p>Margot would have said yes (she passionately wanted to be like her oldest sister in everything), but instead she slept on, even when her father pretended to bite her toes, when he put her foot down and kissed her mother, when she was in danger of being smothered as they whispered to each other.</p><p>She slept the dreamless sleep of an infant who would never be hungry, who would never scavenge in the Thames, who would grow up in the arms of a family so loving that even after the children had grown and left home, Starberry Court would remain their fulcrum, drawing them back with their spouses, and then their children, and, later still, their grandchildren.</p><p>In time, a new wing would be built, at least in part to house the overflow of books (mostly Rose\u2019s, though Margot contributed quite a few as well). The kitchen would acquire new iron stoves, the water closets would be replaced by bathrooms with ceramic bathtubs, and the house would be the first in the county to be electrified. Peter\u2019s grandson would proudly drive one of the very first automobiles into the courtyard.</p><p>No matter the modernizations that Starberry Court underwent, it remained the glowing, comfortable home that India created in 1799: the heart of her family and her descendants, where they learned to laugh, to dance (for the pink ballroom became famous through three counties), to love . . . in short, to live.</p><p>And even two hundred years later, the chandelier that India had found in Venice on their first trip to Italy still hung in a place of honor in a dining room decorated with swallows. </p> </body></html>"]
