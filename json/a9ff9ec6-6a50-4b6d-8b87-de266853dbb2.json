Adam stood at the front, our pack in the middle, listening to his every word. An easy smile fell across my lips as I stared at my Chante. His shaggy blonde hair brushed his jaw as he moved his head with his speech. Strong arms cut through the air as he gestured with his hands. Our pack hung on his every word, and so did I. He captivated me, and not just with his announcement about a scheduled summit. Adam was my other half, my soul mate\u2014my Chante. Every fiber of my being had been designed just for him, as well as he had been for me. As a girl who never kept a boyfriend longer than two weeks, all of this was new to me. I had been thrust into not just a relationship, but also a union. Our bonding tied us together and left me highly aware of his presence. The odd thing was, I wasn\u2019t afraid of it. When I looked at Adam, I felt three things: pride, lust, and love\u2014not necessarily in that order.</p><p>\u201c... to train Anna ...\u201d His words cut through my mind like a blade, severing all thoughts of love and lust. I snapped to attention and listened to what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cAs my Chante, people will use us against each other. All of you will participate in helping me train your alpha female.\u201d</p> <p>Alpha female. I couldn\u2019t forget how I earned that title. After Adam killed his previous mate while defending me, I took her place. It\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. I am not a home wrecker by any means. Eve was a psychotic bitch who had a taste for human flesh and blood. She tried, and failed, to pin the murders on me. When that didn\u2019t pan out, she and Adam\u2019s brother, Anthony, kidnapped me. Long story short, Eve was dead, and because Adam and I are bonded, I am the new alpha female. The ceremony is scheduled to take place in two days. Each one of my pack members respected me, but I didn\u2019t feel like I deserved it. I was not a purebred like alphas are supposed to be, and I didn\u2019t earn the title. As a werewolf for only five months, I didn\u2019t feel like I put in my dues to be at the top of the pecking order. The most I could do was work at earning my place every day. I wanted my pack to respect me because I had earned it and not because of whom I was bonded to. Adam is purebred and alpha material through and through. Me? Not so much.</p><p>\u201cMeeting adjourned,\u201d Adam said. A tingle burst through my veins and his eyes found mine. My wolf quivered, a low growl vibrating through my bones. I watched Adam cut through the pack and stalk toward me. His azure eyes pinned me in my place and promised naughty things. I hoped my brown ones were conveying the same message.</p><p>When he reached me, he rested his hands on either side of the deck\u2019s railing and leaned forward, trapping my body. I watched his mouth slowly come closer, but he did not kiss me.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, his breath hot against my lips. \u201cAs my mate, your place is by my side, not hiding back here.\u201d</p><p>Adam had asked me multiple times to stand up front with him when he had meetings. And each time I opted for watching from afar.</p> <p>\u201cBut you handle them so eloquently,\u201d I told him with a small smile. \u201cI would only distract from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you\u2019re distracting is my concentration. All my eyes wanted to focus on were the curves of your body.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Adam agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle: give the pack my undivided attention or imagine the swell of your breasts. If you stood beside me, you would be out of my line of sight and make things a lot easier on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea how difficult this was on you,\u201d I said with mock sincerity. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair, as your Chante, that I put you out of your misery. Next meeting I will take my place up front.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d He pressed a quick kiss to my lips before Joe called his name, and he headed off to take care of whatever business had popped up.</p> <p>I was learning that the life as an alpha wasn\u2019t easy. Adam was busy seventy percent of the time with pack business. But I had found stuff to fill my time. I had turned Elle into my sparring partner. After fighting with Eve\u2014and learning Adam and I were each other\u2019s weaknesses\u2014I knew I had to learn to fight. I wanted Adam to be confident in my ability to take care of myself. Should another uprising occur, I would be an asset instead of a liability. Aside from learning to fight, I was also training with Wade. He thought I could be a seer, and I was starting to agree with him. While dealing with Eve, I\u2019d had visions of the past. At the time, we thought it was because she was the one who turned me, and our connection linked us. It was farfetched, but not impossible. However, even after Eve\u2019s death, the visions happened three other times.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Elle asked. Her long copper hair was pulled up in a high ponytail. The sprinkle of freckles over her nose darkened with her tan, and her wide green eyes caught the sunlight and sparkled like emeralds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always ready to have my ass handed to me,\u201d I half joked. Elle was a skilled fighter, and it was the reason I chose her for my teacher. The other wolves would help me out, but they were too afraid to hurt me so they held back. Either Adam had warned them to take it easy, or it was their wolves recognizing me as their alpha female, and they didn\u2019t want to hurt me. I needed someone who wasn\u2019t afraid to give me everything they had, and that someone was Elle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Elle said. \u201cYou\u2019re better than you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fabulous teaching skills, sensei.\u201d</p><p>Elle laughed. \u201cCome on, young grasshopper.\u201d</p><p>We headed down the steps of the back deck. There was a large clearing lined by tall pine and birch trees. Our normal spot was a meadow through the forest, but Adam was gone, so he couldn\u2019t stop us. He was a little over protective of me. It was understandable, but also annoying.</p><p>When I stopped walking Elle smiled and quirked an eyebrow. Though she respected Adam as her alpha, she also liked breaking the rules. She knew he may come down hard on her, but she would leave with her throat intact.</p> <p>She began undressing, and I did the same. I could change fully clothed, but I was fond of the capris I was wearing, and if I changed in them, they would be shredded. Though I didn\u2019t care for the lingering looks of my pack mates, I was losing my shyness at the prospect of nudity. That didn\u2019t mean I would traipse around in my birthday suit on a daily basis, but for moments like these, it was okay. Besides, I was the alpha\u2019s mate. If any wolf came sniffing in my direction it would be the last thing he ever did.</p><p>My wolf came to the forefront of my mind. She was anxious and excited to be released. Her power rushed through my veins like a tidal wave, giving me a boost of energy. My skin stretched as my bones contorted and rearranged themselves. White fur began to grow on my arms as my nails lengthened and sharpened like daggers. I fell to my knees, my hands spaced in front of me as the beast overtook my body. Within seconds, my wolf emerged, and she was ready to spar with the ruddy wolf in front of her.</p><p>Whoops and hollers sounded from the deck, causing me to take my focus off Elle. She chose that moment to pounce. She hit my ribs, and I went sailing across the hard ground. I shot up in a fury, a growl ripping through my throat. Elle\u2019s eyes glistened liquid copper as she waited for me to make my move. I circled her, looking for a clear opening. The first to get their teeth around the jugular was the winner. So far, the scoreboard read: Elle-5, Anna-3. I lunged forward, taking Elle\u2019s tail in my teeth and shaking my head back and forth. She snarled and whipped around just how I wanted her to. I used the movement to my advantage and ran for her other side. By the time she realized I wasn\u2019t behind her anymore, it was too late. I tackled her onto her back, and together we rolled down the small incline of the yard in a ball of snarls, teeth, and claws. Her tooth scraped against my muzzle, causing a searing burn in its wake. I snapped my jaws at her as I tried to reach her throat, but her paw connected with my gut and knocked the wind out of my lungs. Elle sprang up, and I did the same. We regarded each other as we circled one another. My wolf was giddy with the excitement of the fight. She dug her claws into the hard earth as she charged toward Elle. Elle went down without so much as a fight. She didn\u2019t move or even snarl, even after I began biting her ear to prod her. My wolf didn\u2019t care, she struck for the throat, applying enough pressure to subdue, but not hurt. When Elle began to whimper I began to worry I had really hurt her. I shifted back in a snap. My wolf disintegrated back within me and left me my old nude self.</p><p>\u201cElle, are you all right?\u201d I pet her fur, searching for an injury that would explain her lethargic state. A throat cleared behind me. I shot up, whirled around, and came face to face with Adam and an older couple. The man had salt and pepper hair with deep-set green eyes and a roadmap of wrinkles across his face. His thin lips were set in a hard, disapproving line. The woman standing next to him watched me as though I were nothing more than a stain discoloring her favorite Chanel blouse. Her blonde hair was twisted up, and not a single piece dared escape its hold. Her right eyebrow crawled up her forehead as her steely blue eyes observed me with distasteful scrutiny. Both of them exuded power. Their presence demanded respect and caused my wolf to whimper in response. The excitement from the fight dissipated and left her nervous. Her instincts to bare her stomach soaked through me and had me on the verge of rolling onto the ground. Something told me that if I did that, it would only lower their impression of me\u2014if that was possible. I knew who this pair was before Adam even spoke.</p><p>\u201cAnna, I would like to introduce you to Maggie and Donald\u2014my parents.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>I walked into the living room to meet Adam\u2019s parents ... after getting dressed, of course. You\u2019d never be able to tell that a fight broke out in here just a couple weeks ago. Adam had his construction crew on the job non-stop and their efforts had paid off. When I returned home from fighting with Eve, the house had been in near shambles. The drywall was busted and crumbling on the floor, and the television had been thrown through the window and broken to pieces on the front lawn. Now, though, everything looked as pristine as Maggie Everwood\u2019s cream dress and coiffed hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam stood up when I entered the room, coming to me to place a hand on the small of my back. We shared a look before he turned me toward his parents and introduced me.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad, this is Anna Avery,\u201d Adam said. \u201cMy Chante.\u201d</p><p>Maggie and Donald shared their own look, one that would make a cobra cower in the corner. Internally, my wolf twisted with anxiety, causing my palms to sweat and my heart to race. Like the fictitious cobra, she too wanted to cower. I made brief eye contact with the pair before looking at the ground. I didn\u2019t think these two would appreciate my ability to withstand their alpha gazes. And something told me Mrs. Everwood would take it as a challenge and gladly put me in my place.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what of Eve?\u201d Maggie questioned, ignoring me completely.</p><p>\u201cEve was sent to her father in Montana for burial,\u201d Adam replied. He squeezed my hand and gave me an apologetic smile. \u201cIt is only out of my respect for him that I returned her to her home. She didn\u2019t deserve an honorable burial.\u201d</p><p>Maggie gasped as though Adam had just punched her in the stomach, and Donald\u2019s jaw tightened. His power rolled off him and slapped me in face. I could feel my wolf whimpering inside me. Taking a deep breath, I shrugged off the effects of his influence. I hadn\u2019t let Adam\u2019s alpha status intimidate me, and I wouldn\u2019t allow his parents to either.</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak to you alone,\u201d Donald said. His eyes graced my face before he stared hard at his son.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you have to say, you can say in front of Anna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not wish to include her in our affairs,\u201d Donald said.</p><p>Adam was about to respond when I spoke up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to speak with Wade any way.\u201d I squeezed his hand one last time before turning and leaving the room. Truth was, I was just as happy to leave as Mr. and Mrs. Everwood were to get rid of me. I leaned against the interior wall of the kitchen and took a deep breath. Regardless of meeting my boyfriend\u2019s parents in the nude, they wouldn\u2019t have liked me had I been dressed to the nines.</p><p>\u201cI find it insulting that you\u2019re parading that mutt around and treating her as your equal.\u201d</p><p>Maggie\u2019s voice filtered through the kitchen and stung my ears. I cringed, but couldn\u2019t move from my vantage point. I needed to hear what they had to say about me. Call me a glutton for punishment, if you will. I knew whatever came out of their mouths would hurt, but that didn\u2019t stop me from leaning in closer to capture the tiniest of whispers.</p><p>\u201cMother, I advise you not to come into my home and insult my mate. She is more of my equal than Eve ever was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, do not speak to your mother in that tone,\u201d Donald said. \u201cAnna is a made wolf, and therefore not acceptable to be an alpha\u2019s mate. Do you have any idea how much money I had to pay Eve\u2019s father for your betrayal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy betrayal?\u201d Adam asked with surprise. \u201cI never asked you to pay him off. And what of Eve\u2019s killings? I suppose we\u2019re to overlook those, simply because she was an alpha? Had we not stopped her, our secret would have been revealed to the humans. And let\u2019s not forget, Anthony was involved. My own flesh and blood mauling humans, yet you look down your noses at Anna.\u201d</p><p>The room grew quiet for a moment. \u201cWe know that your brother was involved, and when he arrives for the conference, we\u2019ll be sure to talk to him,\u201d Maggie said. \u201cAs for Eve, it was your responsibility, as her mate, to get her help. Instead, you shack up with some underling and convince yourself that she\u2019d make a good mate. You\u2019ll make us the laughing stock of the packs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know eavesdropping is childish, right?\u201d</p><p>I whirled around to find Wade leaning against the counter. I had been so wrapped up in Adam\u2019s conversation that I hadn\u2019t even heard him come in. He cocked his buzzed head to the side and smirked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said with innocence. \u201cThey\u2019re talking shit about me. I think I have the right to hear what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>Wade\u2019s eyes slid from my face to the opening of the living room. \u201cWhat did you expect? Alphas never mate with anything other than other purebreds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well it\u2019s stupid. What does being a purebred have to do with me loving their son or being loyal to my pack\u2014both of which I take very seriously?\u201d I walked over to the fridge and retrieved a soda. The large window above the sink gave me a clear view of the back yard. Elle was helping Chelsea transform. The first couple weeks of being a werewolf could be scary and painful. Adam had made me change repeatedly until the snapping of bone and thickening of muscle was only a dull ache.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you and Chelsea?\u201d I looked away from the window and toward Wade. He was sitting at the kitchen table flipping through a magazine. I suspected he was sweet on our new addition, and she was the reason why he stayed behind when the other Leaders left.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He looked up from the page he\u2019d been reading.</p><p>\u201cYou like her, right?\u201d When Wade ignored my question and started reading again I stared back out the window. I had met Chelsea in high school and lost touch with her when everyone else went off to college and I stayed in Wyoming. It was pure coincidence that we ran into her at Wal-Mart. I still felt bad that, because of me, Eve had targeted her and turned her. But I was also a firm believer in fate, and maybe Chelsea was destined to be one of our pack all along.</p><p>\u201cYou better snatch her up before one of the others do,\u201d I laughed through my nose.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Wade said.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>Wade looked up, a grin sliding across his mouth. \u201cI made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled wide. \u201cI knew you had a thing for her.\u201d</p><p>Wade stood up. \u201cCome on. We have training to do.\u201d</p><p>Downtown Buffalo left a lot to be desired. It was mainly filled with hunting, fishing, and antique stores\u2014one strip of road with shabby boutiques on either side. Wade and I had been going to various thrift shops for my training sessions. At first nothing happened. I would pick up an old antique and feel nothing but the dust that had settled on the item. After a week of doing this, something sparked, and I was able to deduce the past of the item. I was my own personal time machine\u2014able to get a glimpse into the past and see what occurred. It didn\u2019t happen every time, though. Sometimes, no matter how hard I concentrated or connected with the item, it would not speak to me.</p><p>\u201cWhen is everyone arriving?\u201d I asked as I slipped down a small aisle between tables. Knick-knacks rested on either side of me, but nothing caught my attention. If I was going to see into the past, then I wanted something exciting. Something told me picking up a vintage coffee cup wouldn\u2019t produce an adventurous vision.</p><p>\u201cThey should start arriving any day. Some maybe as early as tonight,\u201d Wade said as his eyes roamed over the cluttered tables.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens at these conferences?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey\u2019re every year?\u201d</p><p>Wade stuffed his hands in the pockets of his green canvas coat and bobbed his head. \u201cYeah, every year. It\u2019s a way for packs to mingle and talk business. It\u2019s also a great way to find mates and join packs together. There are games ... of sorts.\u201d</p><p>I instantly thought of Elle and Sawyer. Nothing would make me happier than to see them mated. Sawyer had kept his distance from me, only speaking to me when I spoke to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of games?\u201d I picked up a vintage cigarette case. It was made out of pewter and tarnished with age. Floral filigree was embossed on the front. I pushed the snap button that opened it. I imagined some swanky woman from old money had owned it. Maybe she had kept it in her garter belt for safekeeping.</p><p>\u201cGettin\u2019 anything?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Wade and then back down at the case. \u201cNo,\u201d I told him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it works some times and it doesn\u2019t others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still learning. It\u2019ll get easier in time,\u201d Wade reassured me. \u201cAs for the games ... they\u2019re the usual sort: fights and hunts. They are more competition than for fun. Just another way for the wolves to boast about their pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you known other seers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met all sorts,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why some wolves are capable of magic, while others are not. Seers are rare, but there are a couple I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>I perked up a little. \u201cWill they be at the conference?\u201d</p><p>Wade thought for a moment. \u201cNadia might,\u201d he said. \u201cLast time I saw her she was staying with the Utah pack, but if she moved past the borders then no.\u201d</p><p>In our world, the packs were divided up by territories. Ours was the Western territory, and then there are the Central and East regions. We did our thing, and they did theirs. The Leaders patrolled all of the packs. I eyed Wade as he studied the contents on the tables. A life of traveling all the time didn\u2019t seem all that fun. I liked having a home where I could settle down. Wade and the other Leaders stayed with various packs or lived out of hotels.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a Leader?\u201d</p><p>Wade looked up at me and noticed I\u2019d been staring at him. \u201cA few years. When my father died, I took his place,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what I was born to do.\u201d</p><p>I got the impression he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so I dropped it. I set the cigarette case back down and walked farther down the aisle. A rack of vintage clothing rested against the far wall. A long, flowing white wedding gown was protected behind plastic. I unzipped the bag and ran my fingers along the tattered lace. Spots began to dance within my vision. The thrift store slowly faded as a vision stepped into view. I saw a large park full of green grass and blossoming trees. An arch decorated with pink and white flowers stood at the front of a long aisle. White chairs were set up on both sides and full of excited family and friends. I looked down to find the white dress. It squeezed my ribs and made it hard to breathe. An older gentleman was standing beside me, my hand placed in the crook of his arm. My eyes traveled the aisle to find a younger man waiting for me. His shaggy brown hair brushed the collar of his tux. His eyes widened the slightest bit as he stared down at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And just like that, the vision vanished. The thrift store came rushing back, and I had to grab onto the rack of clothing to steady my wobbly legs. As my eyesight came into focus, my stomach rolled with queasiness.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it this time?\u201d Wade asked, walking over to me. He braced a hand on my shoulder and cocked his head to the side to see my face. My blonde hair curtained my face as I hung my head.</p><p>\u201cA wedding,\u201d I told him. I sucked in a lungful of air to ease the adrenaline\u2014and my wolf. She always got antsy when we witnessed a vision. \u201cWhen is the nausea going to stop? We\u2019ve been at this for two weeks now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an exact science,\u201d Wade replied. \u201cEveryone\u2019s power develops differently. I don\u2019t remember Nadia mentioning vision sickness. Are you going to get sick?\u201d</p><p>I stood up straight and thought for a moment. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d The first couple times a vision had come on, it had always resulted in me throwing up or passing out. The last handful had only left me nauseous.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>I glared up at my optimistic teacher. \u201cLet me kick you in the balls over and over and see how many times it takes you to withstand crumbling on the floor.\u201d Call me crazy, but having my stomach turn into a sea of wooziness was not what I called a silver lining. The thing was, I wanted to hone my craft. It may have left me sick, but it was one of the coolest things to happen to me. That didn\u2019t mean that I was enjoying the side effects. I just hoped that the more I saw, the less of a toll it would take.</p><p>\u201cSave the hostility for the pack games,\u201d Wade chuckled, and I reached out to punch him in the arm. He was nice enough to pretend I had hurt him. We both know I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>My cell phone rang, giving me something other than my sensitive stomach to think about. I retrieved it from my pocket and instantly smiled when Adam\u2019s name showed up on the LCD screen.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet home now. Do not stop anywhere or talk to anyone other than Wade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked with confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnthony just showed up, and I want your ass home by my side where I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>I eyed Wade, and he gave me a cautious look. Being a were, our hearing is nearly perfect. I knew he had heard everything Adam had said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, just calm down,\u201d I told Adam. \u201cI think you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not overreacting,\u201d Adam finished. \u201cHe tried killing you once; I won\u2019t give him a second chance. Get home.\u201d</p><p>I was saved from having to calm him down further when the click of the phone sounded in my ear.</p><p>\u201cLooks like class is dismissed,\u201d Wade said.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>When Wade and I pulled up, Adam and Anthony were having a standoff in the front yard. Maggie stood off to the side while Donald stood in between his two sons. My wolf bristled at seeing Anthony. She wasn\u2019t the only one who remembered the week of our kidnap. While Anthony hadn\u2019t physically hurt me, he hadn\u2019t exactly been a savior either.</p><p>Wade and I exited the truck. I hung back, hesitating to get closer to Anthony. I wasn\u2019t afraid of him, not anymore. I was worried if I got too close, though, my wolf would tear him to shreds. We were no longer bound by iron manacles, and were itching to get retribution.</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes found mine. The familiar sapphires were gone and in their place\u2014citrines. His wolf was at the surface, ready to fight should his brother attack. Adam came across the lawn to where I stood and grabbed my hand, placing the majority of his body in front of mine as a protective barrier.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him here,\u201d Adam told his father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to pay tribute to your new alpha and give my sincerest apologies for my previous behavior,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cLove can make you do crazy things. Don\u2019t you agree, Brother?\u201d</p><p>Anthony\u2019s eyes slid past Adam and landed on my face. There was no trace of malice in his gaze, but I didn\u2019t trust his poker face. I knew exactly how he felt about made wolves and their place in pack hierarchy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no brother of mine,\u201d Adam spat.</p><p>Anthony smirked. \u201cYou always were one for theatrics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried to kill my Chante,\u201d Adam snarled. \u201cForgive me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother and I will have a talk,\u201d Donald told Adam. \u201cI will get to the bottom of this.\u201d Donald began to usher Anthony away, but Wade spoke up and stopped them.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Everwood. As a Leader, it is my duty to get to the bottom of this. Anthony and Eve killed humans. That sort of thing cannot go without the attention of the Leaders. It is our judgment that will define his fate, not yours.\u201d</p><p>Golden fire burned behind Donald\u2019s eyes. His lips straightened into a hard line as he glared at Wade. My wolf bristled beneath my skin, ready for a fight. I wasn\u2019t sure if Adam\u2019s father was insane enough to attack a Leader, but his icy glare said he was considering it. What I couldn\u2019t fathom was Maggie and Donald\u2019s complete ignorance to their son\u2019s behavior. Keeping werewolves a secret was not only the Leader\u2019s rule\u2014it was everyone\u2019s. No one wanted the hassle of dealing with frightened humans. It would drum up hysteria, and our mountain would be flooded with hunters.</p><p>Donald\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cVery well, but I request to be present during your questioning.\u201d</p><p>Wade nodded. \u201cAccepted.\u201d He turned toward Adam and asked, \u201cIs it all right if we use your office?\u201d</p><p>Adam tipped his chin in agreement, but didn\u2019t take his steely gaze off his brother. As they turned to head into the house, Anthony smiled and winked at me. Adam took a step forward, but I gripped his shoulder to stop him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Anthony goad you,\u201d I said.</p><p>Adam sucked in a deep breath through his nose and turned toward me. His hand came up and caressed the side of my face. My eyes briefly closed, and my wolf eased.</p><p>\u201cAs long as he\u2019s here, you\u2019re not to be out of my sight. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think he\u2019d try something with everyone around?\u201d I asked. \u201cBesides, Elle\u2019s teachings are proving effective. I took her down in record time today.\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed and slung an arm around my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sure that had everything to do with your viciousness rather than the appearance of my parents and me.\u201d</p><p>I nudged him in the ribs with my elbow. \u201cYou bet your ass it did.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed before Adam\u2019s smile fell, and he stared off into the distance. He looked down at me with concerned eyes.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything will be okay, you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Adam breathed. His arm slipped from my shoulders, and he stood so that we were facing each other. \u201cAnthony isn\u2019t the only thing we have to worry about.\u201d</p><p>My optimistic outlook on Adam\u2019s brother\u2019s visit quickly vanished. What was worse than my boyfriend\u2019s bloodthirsty brother showing up? Not to mention his parents not-so-subtle confession of their distaste of me. I couldn\u2019t imagine what\u2014yet, by the worry swimming through Adam\u2019s eyes, I knew there was something much worse.</p><p>\u201cThe conference,\u201d Adam began, \u201cit\u2019s a place to interact with other packs, but it\u2019s also a place for the single wolves to find mates.\u201d</p><p>I puckered my lips to the side in confusion. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem all that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when the wolf is already mated.\u201d</p><p>Realization dawned on me and punched me in the gut. \u201cYou mean other females might want to fight me to take my place as your alpha female?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen often, but it does happen,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI want you to be ready if it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho in their right mind would want to kill someone\u2019s Chante?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf I\u2019m dead, then you\u2019ll be destroyed.\u201d That sounded conceited, but it was the truth. We\u2019re each other\u2019s other half\u2014the missing link. We completed each other in a way no other man or woman could. And the same could be said for me. If I were to lose Adam, I would retreat to the dark corners of my mind until death eventually came to claim me.</p><p>\u201cWolves do not have to kill to win a challenge,\u201d Adam said. \u201cIf they subdue you for a full seven seconds they win. When it comes to alphas, no underling should be able to subdue you for even three seconds.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say it, but I could read it all over his face. He was worried I wasn\u2019t strong enough to win, should I be challenged. Elle had defeated me multiple times, and she wasn\u2019t even an alpha.</p><p>\u201cThe ceremony is Friday night,\u201d Adam continued. \u201cWhen a wolf goes through the alpha ritual, power is transferred from your pack mates, strengthening your wolf. If we can get through it without any challenges, then we\u2019ll be in the clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No one will challenge me after I\u2019ve received my new alpha powers?\u201d</p><p>Adam gave me a small smile. \u201cOnly if they want to check into an early grave. You, my dear, are mated to a man from an extremely strong bloodline. Not only will you receive the power of the pack, but you\u2019ll also gain the power of my wolf.\u201d Adam wrapped his arms around my waist and stared down at me with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou sound pretty sure of yourself,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cThere are three things I never question: the strength of my wolf, my skills in the bedroom, and the unyielding love I feel for you.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s lips found mine and weakened my knees. I sagged against his hard frame, content to stay wrapped in his arms for a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Adam said against my lips, \u201cshould any wolf challenge you, they best be prepared for me to challenge them. Man or woman, I will kill anyone who threatens what we have. That is my promise to you.\u201d</p><p>I was sure if I were to look in the mirror I would see googly eyes staring back. I was a sucker for this man, a fool walking on clouds, a woman suckered into believing in all the mushy things I use to roll my eyes at. I was helpless against the feelings occupying my heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI find it insulting that you only think someone would challenge me to get to you,\u201d I joked. \u201cWhat if someone challenged you to win me?\u201d</p><p>Twin rows of teeth glistened in the sun as a large smile spread across Adam\u2019s face. \u201cThose women who try to steal your spot are only after the position of power, not me. If men should want to challenge me for you ...\u201d Adam shrugged. \u201cThey can try, but it will only result in their deaths. No. One. Will. Ever. Take. You. From. Me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, speechless to his intensity. My wolf quivered like an excited puppy. She wasn\u2019t the only one who thought a protective male was sexy. I knew that through whatever obstacles were thrown our way, Adam would knock down mountains to keep harm from coming to me. And I would do the same.</p> <p>\u201cSir ...\u201d</p><p>Adam and I turned to see Joe standing a few feet away with a clipboard in his hands. I smiled at the thought of him being turned into a party coordinator. He was responsible for event planning and making sure the visiting wolves had shelter.</p><p>\u201cI needed to go over this itinerary with you if you have a moment,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Adam turned toward me and pressed a kiss to my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to be busy helping the others get ready for the conference. I want you with someone at all times, understand?\u201d</p><p>When I began to open my mouth in protest, Adam placed a finger over my lips to silence me. I was learning when Adam got something into his head it was nearly impossible to get it out.</p> <p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and Adam removed his finger. He smiled and began to walk away.</p><p>\u201cI still think you\u2019re overreacting,\u201d I called after him.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder and said, \u201cWhen this is all over\u2014and nothing happens\u2014please feel free to say, \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He cut across the yard and stopped where Joe was standing. I watched as he pointed off in the distance and then down at the clipboard. The conference was a much bigger deal than I originally thought. Everyone was busy doing something. Everyone except me. Adam hadn\u2019t given me any orders since our bonding, and it felt bizarre. I was used to taking on every little task, and now I had more free time than I knew what to do with.</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>\u201cHey, need some help?\u201d Chelsea had taken on the role of mule for the pack. I felt partly responsible. Just weeks ago that was me.</p><p>\u201cNah, that\u2019s okay,\u201d Chelsea said as she snapped a towel to fold. Her wavy brown hair was twisted up into a bun. Tendrils escaped and grazed her long neck.</p><p>Ignoring her dismissal of my help, I grabbed a shirt and began folding. I smiled when she looked up at me. Things between us had been a bit awkward since she was bitten and turned. I couldn\u2019t blame her for how she felt. When I learned I was going to turn into a hairy monster every full moon it did a number on my head, too.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s changing going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, we don\u2019t have to do the whole small talk thing.\u201d</p><p>I stopped folding and stared at her dumbfounded, and a little hurt. \u201cI know we haven\u2019t talked about what happened that night, and I\u2019m sorry for that\u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for what Eve and her twisted band of followers did to me? It\u2019s not your place to apologize. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d I continued, \u201chad it not been for me she never would have targeted you. For that, I apologize. I know life up here seems tough at first, but you\u2019ll get used to it and find out this group of \u201cmonsters\u201d\u2014I bent my fingers in air quotes\u2014\u201caren\u2019t as bad as they pretend to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re friendlier than a basket of puppies,\u201d Chelsea retorted with a snort. \u201cSo nice in fact, that their warm welcome included turning me into a slave.\u201d</p><p>My bottom lip curled in as I gnawed on it. It was easy to tell someone not to worry or to look on the bright side. Only, I knew from experience how difficult being integrated into a pack was, and how scary it could be. I wasn\u2019t an innocent bystander trying to make her feel better; I was offering firsthand advice.</p><p>\u201cListen, I know you\u2019re angry. The hormones of the wolf bring every little emotion to the surface. Things feel more intense now. You\u2019re allowed to be frightened, and even a little pissed off, but I hope you know that if you need someone to talk to I\u2019m here. It wasn\u2019t long ago that I was standing right where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well we all can\u2019t be Cinderella and have our alpha prince rescue us from our prison.\u201d</p><p>That stung\u2014a lot. My wolf bristled within me, angry and ready to knock her around a little. I snapped my jaw together so tightly the pressure of my teeth grinding into each other made my jaw ache.</p><p>\u201cYour prince may be closer than you think,\u201d I told her before leaving the living room. When I rounded the corner, I leaned against the wall and concentrated on calming my wolf down. She didn\u2019t like when someone picked a fight with us. In her eyes there was only one way to settle it, and it wasn\u2019t through talking.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got company,\u201d Elle said, coming in through the sliding glass doors. She carried a pair of tongs and a bottle of BBQ sauce in her hands. Asher had lent us five large grills that they used at his butcher shop. Currently, they were sitting out on our back deck with clouds of meat-scented smoke rising from them.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked, walking over to the counter and plucking a potato skin from a tray. It was a shame Elle\u2019s culinary skills were wasted on a bunch of werewolves. She could have easily opened a restaurant and made a killing.</p><p>Elle shrugged. \u201cA group of five: three women and two men. Joe is getting them settled in Adam\u2019s old house.\u201d</p><p>I shoved the rest of the potato into my mouth and thought while I chewed. Adam had asked me to stay in his house, but I couldn\u2019t make a home with him in the house he shared with Eve. I know that sounds immature, but we wolves are territorial. No part of me wanted any reminder of that crazy woman. I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to sleep under the same roof she had with Adam. As sick as Eve was, I was sure she cared about Adam in her own twisted way. She may not have loved him like she did his brother, but she cared, nonetheless. Adam hadn\u2019t complained. Instead, he moved into my bedroom in the main house.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Anna.\u201d</p><p>I snapped back to reality. Elle was holding a large tray of meat while juggling utensils under her arms.</p><p>\u201cCan you get the door, your majesty?\u201d She smiled because she knew I hated that royalty, werewolf politics crap. I could tolerate everyone else treating me differently\u2014expect Elle. If she started watching her words around me, I was liable to scream.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you address me correctly,\u201d I said, walking over to the door and placing my hand around the handle. I waited.</p><p>\u201cMy beautiful alpha, could you please assist me in opening the door?\u201d</p><p>I flipped the lock and crossed my arms.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d Elle squealed as she moved her arm to catch the pair of falling tongs. \u201cOpen the damn door or our dinner is going to be served on the floor.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, unlocked the door, and slid it open. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>As she stepped through the door, she said, \u201cThank you, my alpha,\u201d followed by a giggle. I rolled my eyes and joined her and the others out on the deck. The food was still cooking, but multiple people sat at the two patio tables chatting and enjoying longnecks. The sun was falling behind the mountains, painting the sky in sherbet orange and pink. A nice breeze whistled through the tall pine and birch trees, bringing with it the scent of summer. I inhaled deep, relishing the wilderness that stirred the beast within me. These woods and mountains were her playground, an endless smorgasbord of moose, elk, and deer.</p><p>I felt Adam before I saw him. My head instinctively turned to the right just as he came around the back of the house. The wind played with his blond hair, fluttering it against his muscular neck. My tongue snaked out and caressed my upper lip as I stared at his masterpiece. Just then, his head popped up, and his eyes connected with mine. A devilish grin bent one side of his mouth up, and he winked, sending my ever-present desire for him into overdrive. I often wondered if I would ever lose this feeling\u2014grow tired of him like I did the others. And every time I thought about it, I knew without a doubt I wouldn\u2019t. There was no end to the want I had for him.</p><p>When his gaze fell from mine, I realized he wasn\u2019t alone. Two women, a blonde and a brunette stood next to him. Before becoming a werewolf I had never been a jealous woman. Then again, I had never found a man worth being jealous over. Now, when a woman was around Adam, all I could focus on were the calculations of their responses to him\u2014the way they placed their hand on his forearm or threw their head back and laughed as though he was the first person to ever tell a joke. My eye twitched as the brunette stepped closer. It wasn\u2019t a huge difference, but the movement had placed her close enough that her breasts brushed against his arm. The blonde bent over in front of him and leaned over the rose bushes growing along the deck. I was all for stopping and smelling the roses, but I never knew it could be used as seductive maneuver. My eyes slid up to see if Adam was appreciating the view, only to find his eyes on me. My cheeks heated, and I whirled around to break our eye contact. The movement was awkward and ungraceful, sending me bumping into Asher\u2019s shoulder as he stepped through the door.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he said, placing his hands on my shoulders to steady me. \u201cHittin\u2019 the bottle early, huh?\u201d</p><p>I know he was teasing, but it sounded like a good idea. Since becoming a werewolf, I could process alcohol a lot better than I could when I was human. A bottle wouldn\u2019t get me drunk, but it would ease my anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said, slipping around his large frame and into the house. I headed for the bathroom in a mad dash. Luckily, the only person in the house was Chelsea, and she wouldn\u2019t care enough to ask me what I was doing.</p><p>I shut and locked the door, going to the large mirror over the double sinks. I frowned at my reflection. My blonde hair hung limp against my shoulders, and my skin, though tan, could use a coat of makeup\u2014or two. I looked ... plain. My capris and tank top weren\u2019t sexy in the least, especially with a grass stain streaked across my belly. I hadn\u2019t inspected my clothes after changing back to my regular self. I was in a hurry to dress and meet Adam\u2019s parents. I snorted to myself in remembrance of their opinion of me. Maybe if I would have changed into something more appropriate, their impression of me would have been higher. Even as I thought it, I knew it was wrong. It wasn\u2019t my wardrobe that swayed their minds; it was the blood running through my veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince when do you care what people think about you?\u201d I asked my reflection. I smiled to myself and shook my head, realizing I was freaking out over nothing. Who cared that our two new visitors were tall and built like Victoria\u2019s Secret models? I had a few assets of my own\u2014and Adam. What else mattered?</p><p>Tucking my little green monster away, I exited the bathroom and headed back out to the deck. Just in the short amount of time I was gone more people had arrived. I tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and wove between the large bodies. I was halted to a stop when someone slung an arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHave you met our little alpha?\u201d Joe asked, squeezing me closer to his chest. \u201cAnna this is Sage. Sage this is Anna, our new alpha female.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at the woman standing next to Joe. Her raven hair fell to her waist like an oil slick. Almond shaped brown eyes smiled back at me. Her skin was the perfect combination of brown sugar and cream, and she was tall. I felt very tiny by comparison. She wore a leather bustier and low-slung jeans with a tooled leather belt. Turquoise earrings dangled from her ears.</p><p>\u201cHi, Anna. Thank you for having us to your home.\u201d She held out her hand, and I did the same.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, we\u2019re happy to have you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wider, as though amused with my response. Joe leaned in close and whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cClassy, very regal response.\u201d</p> <p>I glared up at him, and he chuckled. I realized then that this week was going to be a lot more difficult than I expected. Our pack was laid back in the manners department. How was I to know there were polite werewolves?</p><p>\u201cI should mingle,\u201d I said as an excuse to leave. \u201cI look forward to getting to know you, Sage.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head and smiled. I took it as my cue to escape the discomfort and made a beeline for Elle. She was in the middle of talking with Sawyer and one of the other females in our pack, Rachel.</p><p>\u201cHey guys.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer and Rachel stopped talking as soon as I stepped into the conversation. My stomach rolled with nervousness. It seemed I was the odd man out all of a sudden. In a sea of new faces, I felt like the stranger.</p><p>\u201cI see some of the visitors have already arrived.\u201d I was looking at Elle, but slid a sideways glance at Sawyer. He shifted his gaze from my face to Rachel\u2019s. She was pretty in a girl-next-door sort of way. Not much of a talker. In the five months I\u2019d been on the mountain, I think we had only a handful of conversations, though she seemed pretty chatty with Elle and Sawyer. Maybe she just didn\u2019t like me for whatever reason.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, did you see the hot blonde?\u201d Elle said with a smirk and a nod of her head. I looked over my shoulder to see the blonde from earlier. She was sitting on the railing of the deck chatting with the brunette and Adam.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen her,\u201d I said between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cCompetition sucks, huh?\u201d</p><p>I swiveled my head back to face Sawyer. \u201cHe\u2019s just talking to them. I\u2019m confident enough that it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d The lie slid through my lips so easily. Sawyer and I were locked in a stare down when Elle cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnna doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about. That girl doesn\u2019t bat for Adam\u2019s team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cShe looks pretty chummy with our alpha.\u201d She looked up at me and then away, embarrassed. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize,\u201d I told her and then glared at Sawyer. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about her or any other woman who talks to Adam.\u201d</p><p>Elle flipped a couple steaks, resting a hand on her hip. \u201cBecause she\u2019s been flirting with me since she got here.\u201d She turned and looked past me to the blonde. \u201cAll I\u2019m sayin\u2019 is, if the beds a-rockin\u2019, don\u2019t come a-knockin\u2019 tonight.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed and bumped her hip with mine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; no one wants to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d Asher said walking up to us. His shaggy brown hair was pulled back into a low ponytail, and his normal scruff was shaved clean.</p><p>\u201cAsher ... did you ... shave?\u201d My eyes fell to his clothes. \u201cAnd you tucked in your shirt?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his stubble-free jawline and shrugged. \u201cI figured I\u2019d clean the mug for the ladies to enjoy this week. And I only tucked the shirt in because there\u2019s a hole at the hem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll bring \u2018em to their knees, you stud muffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d He winked and took a swig of his beer.</p><p>I slapped his arm and laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Elle, Rachel, and I were all laughing over Asher\u2019s comments, but Sawyer stepped away. I watched him head down the porch steps and into the yard. Someone had started building a bonfire for later tonight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I told my friends and followed Sawyer out into the yard. I couldn\u2019t stand the awkwardness between us. Just a short time ago, we were sort of a couple, if being forced on dates was considered being a couple. Still, I had grown to like Sawyer and, before bonding with Adam, imagined us being mates. In the end, the undeniable pull toward Adam ruined any chance with Sawyer. I knew it was still a sore subject for him, but ignoring me wouldn\u2019t fix it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I ruined that back there,\u201d I said, coming up alongside Sawyer. He looked over at me and then out at the trees. \u201cI can explain to Rachel that nothing is going on between us anymore. I\u2019m pretty sure she doesn\u2019t like me, but I can make her listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d he asked quizzically.</p><p>\u201cYeah, weren\u2019t you two ... you know, hitting it off before I came along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. We were just chatting with Elle. Rachel\u2019s nice, but not for me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t question why. I wanted our conversation to stay on safe ground, and I was afraid of what his response might be. Not that I thought he was still hopelessly into me, but it\u2019s never easy to talk to an ex about present or future relationships.</p><p>\u201cSo, why did you leave?\u201d I sat down beside him on one of the hay bales surrounding the stacked bonfire wood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a little weird ... being around you. I\u2019m happy for you, but I\u2019m not ...\u201d He looked over at me. \u201cYa know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as my stomach churned with dizzy butterflies. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m sorry, Sawyer. I wish things would have gone differently.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over so that his arms were resting on his legs and looked over at me. His spiky, sandy blond hair glistened in the falling sun. \u201cHow do you mean? You\u2019re not happy with Adam?\u201d</p><p>My bottom jaw dropped in surprise. \u201cWhat? No. I just meant, if he hadn\u2019t forced me to date you, then you wouldn\u2019t have gotten hurt. I love talking to you, and now things are just ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwkward?\u201d Sawyer supplied.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way of our world\u2014the strongest prevail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d I told him. \u201cI didn\u2019t choose Adam over you because he\u2019s the alpha. I didn\u2019t really have a say in the matter. It just ... is what it is. We\u2019re Chantes.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer was nodding his head, but not saying anything. I figured I said what I had to say and staying longer would only undo what I had done. I stood up and was on my way back to the deck when Sawyer finally spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you I\u2019m mad at.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and turned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam knew how he felt about you when he paired us together. He may have been trying to fight it, but he knew damn well he would eventually claim you, and he did. He made me ... and then took you ... just like that.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes turned hard as he stared at me. I could see the pain hiding within them, and it made my heart break. In a normal situation, a girl would have a choice between the two men. In my predicament, there was no question, no doubt who I was supposed to be with. It was Adam. It would always be Adam. Since the bonding, every other man fell off my radar. I didn\u2019t see Sawyer, or anyone else, in the same light as I saw Adam. That just made my relationship with Sawyer that much harder. I couldn\u2019t give him even an inch of hope, and my compassion would only make him think I pitied him.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a choice either,\u201d I told him again, turning and heading back to the group. I hugged my arms to my chest and lost myself to my thoughts as I walked. I could feel familiar eyes on me. His gaze licked my skin and awakened my wolf. I lifted my head to see Adam standing on the steps staring out at me.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked as I reached him. He wasn\u2019t staring at me anymore. His eyes locked on Sawyer\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d I smiled, hoping he couldn\u2019t feel the inner turmoil roiling through my stomach. There wasn\u2019t much we could hide from each other now that we were Chantes, but I still hoped he didn\u2019t pick up on my guilt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset,\u201d Adam stated. \u201cIs it because of him,\u201d he nodded toward Sawyer, \u201cor have I done something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cNobody did anything.\u201d I stepped up the first couple of steps and wrapped my arms around his waist, resting my head on his chest. Closing my eyes, I inhaled his scent. It eased my mind and washed away any semblance of worry I had.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s ready,\u201d Elle called over the loud crowd. Everyone stopped talking and bowed their heads. Adam bent over, kissed the top of my head, and then grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on, my Chante.\u201d Together we walked up the steps to join the others. Adam walked over to the front of the deck. There were at least thirty people on the porch and more lingering in the yard. The ones mingling on the lawn began walking forward.</p><p>\u201cIt is with great pleasure that the Everwood pack welcomes the Annual Conference to Wyoming. Some of you know my family and me, but have not met my mate, Anna.\u201d Adam held our joined hands up to signal to me. I met everyone\u2019s eyes, a smile on my face, and nodded in greeting. A few of the responding faces were not so welcoming. The blonde Adam was speaking to earlier stood in the back with her friend, both of them eyeing me like a hungry cat facing a mouse. My wolf responded with a vibrating growl I hoped no one heard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I looked up at Adam, he was looking down at me. Heat warmed my cheeks and settled in my belly. I don\u2019t know why I was so worried about looking plain; I could have worn a hospital gown, and I would always feel beautiful when he looked at me like that.</p><p>\u201cWe look forward to getting to know each and every one of you. Our homes are yours,\u201d Adam continued. \u201cNow, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>A wave of applause filled the small space, bouncing off the trees and mountains. Adam tugged me toward the table where the plates and silverware were set up. After filling our plates, we took them to the glass patio table. The sky was beginning to darken to a hazy purple. Someone lit torches surrounding the deck. The burning oil was a bit strong for my sensitive nose, but I would get over it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of new faces here,\u201d I said as I scooped a spoonful of potato salad.</p><p>\u201cThese are only a portion of those coming,\u201d Adam said, taking a swig of his beer. Joe, Asher, and the two bimbos from earlier joined us at our table. My muscles tensed against my bones as my wolf readied herself for a fight. As much as I tried to convince Sawyer and Elle that I wasn\u2019t jealous of these two, my wolf didn\u2019t care. She saw the way they smiled and eyed Adam and was ready to sprout claws and sharp teeth.</p><p>\u201cAnna have you met Chloe?\u201d Joe signaled to the blonde. \u201cAnd Cadie?\u201d he said, signaling to the brunette.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe I have,\u201d I said with as much politeness I could manage, all things considered. I had been a wolf long enough that I should have had a handle on my inner beast. The amplified emotions got to me sometimes, especially where Adam was concerned. Chloe and Cadie\u2019s eyes were on Adam. They smiled coyly before looking over to me. My teeth crunched together as I pasted on a fake smile. I would not lose my cool in front of all of these people.</p><p>\u201cLana, is it?\u201d Chloe said with a smirk.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Anna,\u201d I bit out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There are just so many people here tonight it\u2019s hard to keep the names straight,\u201d Chloe said with a saccharine sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t seen you around,\u201d Cadie commented. \u201cWhat clan are you bred from?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Adam briefly and then back at the slut twins. \u201cNo clan.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes widened in unison. Joe nudged me underneath the table with his foot. When I looked at him, he was silently laughing to himself. Angry, I stomped on his foot, and his knee shot up and shook the table. Served him right for causing trouble.</p><p>Adam cleared his throat. \u201cTell me, how is the Elson tribe?\u201d</p> <p>After that, Adam, Chloe, and Cadie chatted as though I wasn\u2019t there. I continued to stuff my face, if for no other reason than to keep my mouth from saying something stupid. Cadie laughed like an excited hyena, while Chloe flipped her hair so much I thought\u2014or hoped\u2014it would catch the flame of the nearby torch. My jaw ached from grinding my teeth so hard, and my muscles were so tight, I half expected them to snap under the pressure. Adam is just being a good host, entertaining them. Did he have to smile so much, though? They weren\u2019t that funny.</p><p>\u201cAnna, may I speak with you for a moment?\u201d Elle asked, coming to our table. I looked up from my plate\u2014my mouth fuller than a chipmunk\u2019s\u2014and nodded. I\u2019d been thinking of an excuse to escape since Chloe and Cadie first sat down. I stood up, excused myself around the mouthful of food, and walked away with Elle.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked, though it came out sounding like, \u2018was pup.\u2019</p><p>\u201cSwallow that damn food before you choke, and I have to give you the Heimlich.\u201d</p><p>I chewed a few more times and swallowed. \u201cSorry, what did you need?\u201d I asked as we stepped into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Elle snapped.</p><p>I looked down at my hands afraid I had sprouted claws and fur. I was relieved to find my normal, human hands. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you letting those twats slobber all over your man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for a fight?\u201d Elle interrupted.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhat? No, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs the alpha\u2019s mate, all eyes are on you. There isn\u2019t one woman who doesn\u2019t envy your position and would kill to take it. Got me? Don\u2019t let a pair of hoochies swoop in and intimidate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just say hoochies?\u201d I laughed, but stifled it when Elle glared at me. \u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I held my hands up in surrender. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to appear weak or let them intimidate me. I trust Adam and acting like a jealous girlfriend would only embarrass him ... and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re werewolves, Anna. We get off on overprotective mates. If people see you cowering in the corner while other females flirt with your mate, they\u2019re going to either assume you\u2019re an easy take down, or that you couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Elle stepped over by me and placed her hands on my shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re not just an underling anymore. You\u2019re the alpha\u2019s mate, soon to be an alpha yourself. If you don\u2019t assert your position, someone is going to kill you for it. Now, get your little ass out there and show those bitches your grrr face.\u201d She turned me toward the door and spanked me on my butt.</p><p>I smiled and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re the best. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get out there and make me proud. Because, as your teacher, it\u2019s my rep that\u2019s on the line. Don\u2019t make me look stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to work on your manners,\u201d I told her before I slipped back outside. Chloe took my seat in my absence and was leaning a little too close to Adam. I flexed my fingers at my side, curling and uncurling them into fists.</p><p>I made a beeline towards Adam\u2019s table. His eyes found mine as I cut through the group of people. Chloe\u2019s head snapped up just as I reached the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, here, let me get out of your spot.\u201d</p><p>I eyed her with disdain and held up my hand. \u201cNo need.\u201d Stepping around Cadie\u2019s chair, I sat on Adam\u2019s lap and wrapped an arm around his neck. Leaning in, I kissed him and twined my fingers through his hair. I meant for it to be just a quick kiss, but when Adam\u2019s tongue slipped through my lips, I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I pressed myself closer, and Adam snaked an arm around my waist to hold me tighter. My wolf perked up and devoured the lusty sensation Adam stirred within us. The noise of the party faded away until all that I could comprehend was the hardness of his chest against mine, the softness of his lips, and the scent of our mingling arousal swirling in the air. I was just about to rip his shirt when I opened my eyes and reality came rushing back. The noise of our visitors flooded my ears and splashed a metaphorical bucket of cold water on me. I smiled against Adam\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I could feel your pervy eyes enjoying the show too much,\u201d I joked. \u201cYou need to find a woman, Joe. Maybe Cadie or Chloe would be interested?\u201d I looked at them in unison. Chloe\u2019s left eyebrow crawled up her forehead as her aqua eyes glared at me with a vengeance. I had a feeling the bimbo twins wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less than an alpha of their own. Unfortunately, they had their eyes on mine.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to get me dates. Besides, I have my eye on that.\u201d Joe pointed to a woman out in the yard. \u201cNo offense, ladies. You\u2019re both very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense taken,\u201d Cadie said, her tone snarkier than a hormonal teen girl.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to talk to her or stalk her from afar?\u201d Adam asked, nodding to the woman in the yard.</p><p>For as long as I had been living with the Everwood pack I\u2019d never seen Joe with a female. I assumed it was because as Adam\u2019s second-in-command he was always too busy, but maybe Joe was shy when it came to interacting with females he liked.</p><p>\u201cI have it worked out. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Adam reached around me and grabbed his beer, bringing it slowly to his lips. Was it irrational to be jealous of a bottle? He winked at me, and I smiled, still riding the high from our kiss.</p><p>Adam\u2019s gaze fell over my shoulder. His smile turned hard as he stared at someone. I followed his gaze and caught Elle watching us. I curled my lip over my teeth and held up my hand to mimic claws to show her I had in fact put on my grrr face. She nodded and smiled. A few people moved out of the way, and I realized what had Adam on edge. Anthony had stepped onto the porch and was chatting with the visitors. It looked like Wade\u2019s interrogation hadn\u2019t gone the way Adam expected it to.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cAnna, may I see you a moment?\u201d Wade asked, coming over to our table. Nodding, I climbed off Adam\u2019s lap and stood up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Wade placed a hand on the small of my back and guided me away from the ears of our guests. Together we walked down the steps and out into the yard. When Wade was pleased with the distance, we stopped walking. We weren\u2019t alone, though; I could feel Adam fast approaching. I turned just as he reached us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked Wade. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t my brother in cuffs and on his way to the Leaders for sentencing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Leader, or have you already forgotten?\u201d Wade bit back, clearly annoyed with being questioned. \u201cWhile your brother was involved with Eve, it was of a sexual matter. He did not partake in the killings or planning.\u201d</p><p>Adam snorted and took a step toward Wade. With his pointer finger, he stabbed Wade in the chest and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you believe him. And even if you don\u2019t have proof, he was involved in Eve\u2019s plan, and you have proof he kidnapped Anna. That deserves retribution.\u201d</p><p>Wade\u2019s movement was so fast I almost didn\u2019t see him grab Adam\u2019s hand. \u201cI will not cause a scene with you while we have visitors. I understand you\u2019re upset and want payback for him kidnapping your mate, but losing your cool will not help the situation.\u201d He released Adam\u2019s hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam released a ragged, growly breath. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course, but you cannot trust my brother. He has ulterior motives; you can be sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Adam. I know he\u2019s up to something. Your parents\u2019 presence isn\u2019t making my job any easier. They wish to deal with it themselves.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Wade. \u201cHow can they go against a Leader\u2019s wishes?\u201d</p> <p>Wade shot Adam a knowing look. It was Adam who responded.</p><p>\u201cThe Everwood name goes way back, before we ever established the Leaders. Ours is of an olde bloodline, and with it comes a sort of diplomatic immunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like you guys are royalty or something?\u201d I laughed and then saw the seriousness on Wade and Adam\u2019s faces. \u201cSeriously? The Everwoods are considered werewolf royalty?\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cNot in the human sense. We don\u2019t refer to ourselves as kings and queens. Wolves respect power, and those who have survived through the millennia\u2014the ones of olde blood\u2014are highly respected.\u201d</p><p>I thought about how Chelsea had called me Cinderella earlier. Maybe I had found a prince of sorts. And it made sense as to why the females would want an Everwood as a mate. Female wolves craved a powerful mate, and it looked like I was bonded to one of the strongest.</p> <p>\u201cIs the Everwood bloodline the only one of olde blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two more: Blackwood and Ashwood, one in each territory.\u201d</p><p>I found it bizarre they all had wood in their surnames, but chose not to comment. \u201cSo, what did you need to talk to me about, Wade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to try to get a vision from Anthony. In order to do that, you\u2019ll have to touch him\u2014maybe multiple times\u2014without seeming awkward. Do you think you can pull it off?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI can try, but it\u2019s not guaranteed I\u2019ll see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Anna near Anthony without me, or someone equally powerful, present. He\u2019s already kidnapped her once,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>I crossed my arms and shifted my weight, causing my hip to cock out. \u201cI\u2019m not helpless. I\u2019ve learned a lot from Elle, and when he kidnapped me, I had just gotten in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled down at me. \u201cI know you\u2019re not helpless, Chante. I simply don\u2019t want you alone with him ... for my own peace of mind. The convention already comes with threats; I don\u2019t want to add to them.\u201d</p><p>I thought about the threats Adam was talking about. While I was feeling more confident with my fighting skills, I wondered how much I was going to have to use them. Now that I knew I was bonded to a man from an olde bloodline, I would have to be on constant watch. My and Adam\u2019s relationship was especially sensitive because we\u2019re linked as Chantes. If something were to happen to me, it would end up destroying Adam and vice versa. That was a lot of pressure. I had to keep myself safe, no matter the cost, in order to keep Adam safe. I watched Adam as he talked with Wade and wondered how someone so powerful could put all of their faith in someone like me. Tomorrow night I would go through the alpha ceremony, but I would still not be alpha born. My mixed blood could never be anything other than what it was\u2014mutt blood.</p><p>I looked up at the porch and the new arrivals. Already, Chloe and Cadie had shown interest in Adam, and there were still a lot more people coming\u2014more females who would take one look at Adam\u2019s mutt mate and assume they could take me down. Fear snaked its way through my body as I thought about the impending challenges.</p><p>Fingers curled around my forearm. I snapped out of my thoughts and met Adam\u2019s eyes. There was so much confidence and love when he looked at me I could almost feel the weight of his gaze against my skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late,\u201d Adam said. \u201cHow about we head to bed.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, taking Adam\u2019s hand and walking away from Wade and toward the house. The sky was as black as a raven\u2019s wing, bejeweled by a million glittery stars. The wind stirred against my face, carrying the coolness from the snowcapped mountains.</p> <p>Adam and I headed into the house and back to my bedroom. I began to shuck my shoes and change into my pajamas when Adam grabbed my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been somewhere else all night,\u201d he said, pulling me into his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s on that crazy mind of yours?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNothing of importance.\u201d</p><p>Adam brought his hand to my face and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. His fingers trailed down my cheek while his eyes searched my face for the truth. It didn\u2019t matter what words my lips spoke, our bond was like a lie detector. Adam could notice my anxiety just as much as I could pick up his worry. No secrets could hide between us.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Adam said softly. \u201cAre you worried about Anthony?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, surprisingly Anthony hasn\u2019t crossed my mind. It\u2019s ... well, finding out about your bloodline and how desirable it is ... it\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d I snorted. \u201cAnd here I thought females would challenge me because of your rugged good looks.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cI told you it had nothing to do with me as a person. You know how wolves operate: they crave strength and power.\u201d He cupped my face. \u201cNothing will ever come between us, you know that right?\u201d</p><p>Except being murdered for my position, I thought to myself. \u201cYes,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the other women. I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll put your life in danger by not being up to par with those who challenge me. If anything were to ever happen to you because I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Adam placed a finger against my lips to silence my panic. \u201cI have complete faith in you. Since when have you ever laid down and admitted defeat?\u201d He removed his finger and trailed his hands down my arms. \u201cWhen the world tries to knock you down you fight back. You\u2019re passionate about what you believe in, and you can believe in us. Everything will be okay.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head wordlessly, thinking about what he said. I wanted to see the strength in myself that he saw\u2014to be as confident of a positive outcome as he was. In that moment, I convinced myself everything would be okay\u2014that all I had to do was keep an optimistic mind. Adam\u2019s words lent me strength and eased my mind. Everything would be okay, simply because it had to be. I couldn\u2019t accept anything less.</p><p>Around three in the morning I woke up. I stared up at the ceiling while I listened to the party still carrying on outside. Adam was lying on his back, his arms bent under his pillow. I propped myself up on my elbow and watched how peaceful sleep made him. He wasn\u2019t an alpha from an olde bloodline or responsible for managing a pack of rowdy werewolves while he slept. He was just a man\u2014a gorgeous man\u2014lost in a sea of dreams.</p><p>Crawling out of bed, I slipped on a pair of cotton shorts. My mind was too chaotic to succumb to sleep again. Tiptoeing, I slipped out of my bedroom and closed the door quietly behind me. All of the lights in the house were still on, and the television echoed from the living room. I headed down the hall and rounded the corner. Eight men I didn\u2019t recognize and Asher sat on the large sectional watching some action movie. It was right in the middle of a car chase when all nine heads lifted in my direction. I held up my hand in a small wave and an apologetic smile crossed my face for interrupting their movie. One of the men, a guy with hair the color of muddy water and eyes just as dark, appraised me with an unwanted appreciation. His eyes traced the length of my legs, coming up to settle on my breasts.</p><p>\u201cDibs,\u201d he said, popping up off the couch.</p><p>Asher chuckled, reaching out to capture his arm before he could reach me. \u201cThat\u2019s not a wise choice. That is Anna\u2014our alpha female. You lay one fingertip on her, and we\u2019ll be having your funeral this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Realization settled in the man\u2019s eyes. Asher released his arm, and the man walked over to me, holding out his hand. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to play the political role, but it was part of my game now. I doubted the Presidents of the human world wanted to shake hands and kiss babies either, but they did it.</p><p>I clasped his hand and shook it once before dropping it. Now, more than ever, I would have to keep my shields up, play the game of strong alpha female for two important reasons: keeping the threats at bay and not embarrassing Adam. Finding out he was somewhat regal in the werewolf community made me feel like I was some sort of rebellion he\u2019d decided on\u2014kinda like when a rich girl dates a bad boy just to piss off Daddy. It was a silly thought, I know. Adam and I weren\u2019t merely \u2018hanging out,\u2019 we are each other\u2019s Chantes. Still, I couldn\u2019t help the small insecurity from skipping through my mind. I could feel everyone\u2019s eyes judging me as they decided whether I would succeed or tank as an alpha.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d I supplied.</p><p>\u201c... Anna. I\u2019m Everett of the Windsor clan.\u201d His eyes slipped from mine and traveled down my neck where they settled on the swell of my cleavage. I was used to walking around the house in whatever, without a second thought, until now. I would have to invest in some turtlenecks and parkas until the conference was over. My wolf growled within me, disliking the lack of respect Everett was showing us. Without a thought, my knee snapped up in one swift motion and landed between Everett\u2019s legs. He bent over; his hands went to his crotch and he coughed a few times.</p><p>\u201cEverett, you may be a guest in my home but, while you\u2019re under my roof, you will show me the respect I deserve. Keep your eyes off my chest.\u201d I knelt down so I could look him in the eye. With my pointer finger, I tipped his chin up. \u201cAs a matter of fact, unless I speak to you, do not speak to me.\u201d</p><p>The rush of adrenaline from my anger quickly dissipated and left me breathless. My hands shook, and I looked over at the remaining men. Their eyes were wide, eyebrows arched in shock. Embarrassment caused my cheeks to redden. Without another word, I headed toward the stairs and took them two at a time until I slipped around the corner, out of view. I leaned against the wall, listening to the men below tease Everett about his chiding. I inhaled deep breaths through my nose, holding them for a few seconds before exhaling through my mouth. My wolf calmed down, and the edge of anger disappeared, leaving me confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell just happened? I\u2019d been known to stand up for myself, but publicly attacking someone for just looking at me was a bit extreme. So much for making a good impression. I was sure, come tomorrow, the story of how Adam\u2019s new mate assaulted one of his visitors would be on the lips of everyone.</p><p>I cut across the hall and disappeared into the office. A large mahogany desk jutted out from the left wall. Two bookcases rested on the other side of the room, filled with various volumes. An arched window overlooked the backyard and had a swath of hunter green fabric framing it.</p><p>I walked over to one of the bookcases and lifted a pewter statue of a moose. Turning it, I slid a secret compartment open and retrieved a key. Heading over to the desk, I sat down and stuck the key into the center drawer. When the key turned, I opened the drawer and retrieved the Everwood pack book. Adam had placed the book in the main house while guests were visiting because he didn\u2019t want outsiders finding and reading it. Not that it held super-secret information, but packs tended to be protective of their history and heritage. It was in this book that I learned that Chantes were an ancient wolf legend. Elle and I had stolen the book from Adam and Eve\u2019s house just a few short weeks ago, and now it was mine to browse through as I pleased.</p> <p>I ran my fingertips over the aged leather and settled into the large chair, pulling my feet up underneath me. Flipping the book open, I examined each page. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking for, but I\u2019d know when I found it. The book was hand-written by each prior alpha. Adam\u2019s father had handed it down to him and when Adam had children, he would do the same. I paused and thought about kids. While I didn\u2019t have anything against them, I also couldn\u2019t see myself as a mother. Would time change my mind? If Adam found out I didn\u2019t want to carry his offspring, would he feel differently for me? Now that I was bonded to Adam, so many questions filled my head. Before the only question on my lips was whether Adam would leave Eve. My wish had come true, and Adam was mine, but I was finding out, it wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.</p><p>I sagged against the soft leather of the chair and stared off into space. Though Eve was a psycho, I could now understand where her attitude came from. As the mate of the alpha, she had an appearance to uphold. I frowned as I thought about her and her tough exterior. Could I mimic that attitude to scare off power hungry werewolf women, and would I be any good at it? I had a feeling I would have to work twice as hard as Eve did being branded a mutt. Without alpha blood running through my veins, people would assume I\u2019d be an easy takedown. I had to do everything in my power to prove them wrong. I would train with Elle all day every day if that was what it took. Being responsible for someone other than myself had me almost in a panic, which is where my fear of having kids came into play. I couldn\u2019t allow another woman to take my spot because I knew it would destroy Adam. Being tied together sounded sweet in theory, but it was wreaking havoc on my nerves. I was sure Adam didn\u2019t share my dilemma since he came from one of the strongest bloodlines. Our union was only as strong as its weakest link. Unfortunately, I was it.</p><p>I snapped out of my thoughts and resumed browsing through the book. Elaborate drawings of past alpha ceremonies were charcoaled against the parchment paper in great detail. Every time I looked at them, the pride of my wolf swelled inside of me. There was something magical about being a werewolf. The bond between packs was an invisible force tethering all of us together. Adam and I may be bonded, but I\u2019m also attached to the rest of the wolves. They are my family now, and I would do everything in my power to not let them down.</p><p>I flipped to the next page right when the door to the office opened. My head snapped up, and my eyes met with Maggie Everwood\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d she said it as though she found a vandal snooping through her son\u2019s things.</p> <p>\u201cReading,\u201d I replied. I decided keeping my responses as minimal as possible was best when dealing with Adam\u2019s parents. They didn\u2019t need any other reasons to hate me\u2014my dirty bloodline did that for me.</p><p>\u201cDoes Adam know you\u2019re reading that?\u201d She nodded toward the book in my hands. I looked down at the book and then up at her, stupefied for a response. It dawned on me right then that, though she didn\u2019t like me being mated to her son, she also didn\u2019t think I was even good enough to read a book based on our pack.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d I told her. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake him up and ask, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Maggie walked farther into the room. Coming around the desk, she rested one hand on her hip and held the other out to me.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best to wait for Adam. If he wants you going through the book, then he can help you with it.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her outstretched hand and ground my teeth until my jaw ached with the pressure. Attacking my boyfriend\u2019s mother was tempting, but I didn\u2019t think Adam would appreciate it. It sucked having to force a smile while biting my tongue. Standing, I handed her the book and stepped around her.</p> <p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>I spun around and met Maggie\u2019s crystalline eyes, surprised by the question. \u201cHe\u2019s the only man I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p><p>Maggie walked the short distance to me and reached for my hand. Turning it over, she stared at the upraised scar on my palm. I watched her face as she examined the mark. Her lips curled down in a frown while her jawline stretched tight.</p><p>\u201cYou would put him above yourself?\u201d Her eyes slid up to meet mine.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOf course. I would do anything for him.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth rose in a small smile as though I said the right thing. \u201cThen you should leave Wyoming.\u201d I began to speak, but she held up her hand to stop me. \u201cI know how cruel that sounds,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I know you and Adam think this mark is a testament to your destiny\u2014it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a target on my son\u2019s life. When word spreads that an alpha from a superior bloodline is branded by the Chante mark, and to a mutt no less, rivals will come to take him out and claim his spot.\u201d Maggie dropped my hand and crossed her arms. She looked away, but I didn\u2019t miss the blur of tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOur enemies will take one look at you and know just how easy it\u2019d be to kill you and, by doing so, ruin Adam. Once you\u2019re dead, what possible threat would Adam be to them? You are his weakness, Anna, the one thing that can undo everything he\u2019s accomplished.\u201d Maggie looked at me again. A lone tear slid down her peaches and cream cheek. \u201cIf you love him\u2014truly love him\u2014you have to let him go. So long as you guys are together, Adam\u2019s life is in danger.\u201d</p><p>Maggie gave me one last look before stepping around me and heading toward the door. She turned around and said, \u201cThink about it, Anna,\u201d before she left me speechless.</p> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>I was wide awake when Adam woke up. After the conversation with Maggie, I had crawled back into bed with Adam, but hadn\u2019t been able to fall back asleep. I didn\u2019t notice he was even awake until he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou look entirely too serious for six a.m.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, his voice jarring me from my thoughts, and looked up to find him propped up on an elbow watching me. His hair was ruffled, and his face still held the relaxation from sleep. He was gorgeous all of the time, but mornings he was divine. I tried for a smile, but it felt awkward on my lips.</p><p>\u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally well, considering...\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips in question.</p><p>\u201cI woke up last night and felt an extreme case of anxiety.\u201d He brushed my hair away from my face. \u201cI knew it was coming from you, but I wanted to give you space. I don\u2019t want our bond to make you feel like I\u2019m smothering you.\u201d Adam smiled. \u201cWhat happened last night? Where\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>I looked away and stared out the window on the other side of the room. I couldn\u2019t tell Adam about what Maggie had said. He would only try to convince me it wasn\u2019t true, and I knew it was. His life was in my hands just as much as mine was in his. The only difference was, Adam was completely capable of keeping me safe. I couldn\u2019t say the same for him.</p><p>\u201cJust nerves about the conference and the alpha ceremony,\u201d I told him. It was half-true and, by the look on Adam\u2019s face, he bought it.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou\u2019re tougher than you look, and someone challenging you is the worst case scenario. I doubt anyone actually will.\u201d He winked, causing me to smile wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on today\u2019s agenda?\u201d I asked, wanting to change the subject. Though I was nervous about being challenged, it wasn\u2019t what was tormenting my mind at the moment, and lying to Adam didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the packs will be arriving,\u201d Adam said, rolling over and positioning himself between my legs so that he was lying on his stomach. He peeled my tank top up to expose my stomach and placed a kiss just below my navel. \u201cThere will be a group dinner.\u201d Adam wound an arm around my leg, his fingers squeezing my flesh as he tugged my thigh closer to his mouth. \u201cToday will be low key. The fun stuff starts tomorrow.\u201d He looked up the length of my body at me. A strand of blond hair fell across his hungry eyes. Gold was already starting to bleed through his sapphire irises, a sure sign he was turned on.</p><p>My wolf came alive, revving my own sex drive into motion. I could spend day and night in bed with Adam and never tire of feeling his skin against mine. I held my breath when he hooked his fingers in the hem of my shorts and began tugging them down. He knelt up and drew them off my legs, tossing them over his shoulder. His lips spread into a big grin when he lowered himself back down.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like the fun stuff is starting right now,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Adam replied, bringing his mouth closer to my sweet spot. Speaking against my center, he said, \u201cDo you have any idea how hard it\u2019s been getting out of this bed every morning?\u201d His tongue seared a path all the way up to my clitoris. A sweet shudder worked its way through my bones. \u201cI find myself thinking of the sounds you make when I\u2019m inside of you.\u201d Another slow, languid stroke. \u201cHow wet you get for me when it\u2019s my dick filling you.\u201d He flicked his tongue against my clit and then slid two fingers into me. I moaned as I watched his hand move in and out. My eyes fell to the tent of his boxers, causing another hungry shudder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want you all the time, Chante,\u201d Adam said, pressing a kiss to my inner thigh while his he moved his hand slowly, his fingers teasing my center. \u201cIn every possible position. Pounding into you. Making you cry out for me.\u201d The thrust of his fingers increased, punctuating each sentence. \u201cFuck, Anna, you\u2019re so wet for me.\u201d Then he did one of the sexiest things I\u2019d ever seen. He withdrew his fingers from me, brought them to his lips, and sucked them into his mouth. He watched me as he licked my wetness from his fingertips, his gaze hungry and predatory.</p><p>\u201cTurn over,\u201d he ordered. Happy to oblige, I flipped onto my stomach, anxious for more. I felt the bed shift and then clothes hitting the floor. When he crawled back onto the bed, he slipped a strong arm under my stomach, lifting my behind into the air. My legs trembled. A sweet throb pulsed between my thighs, craving Adam\u2019s fullness.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me, Chante.\u201d</p><p>I lifted up, supporting myself with my hands while I spread my legs. I felt hair tickle my inner thigh, and then Adam was lying on his back, in between my legs. Curling his hands around my thighs, he tugged me down so that I was poised right over his mouth. I held my breath, realizing what he wanted me to do.</p><p>\u201cRide me, baby.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but my shyness kicked in right at the moment. I\u2019d done virtually almost everything else with Adam, but the thought of riding his face gave me pause. What if I suffocated him? I could just see it now: Alpha female smothers her Chante between her thighs.</p><p>Adam noticed my hesitance and prodded me with a series of kisses, flicking his tongue. His hands gripped my behind, moving my hips back and forth while his mouth enticed me. It took exactly two seconds for my hips to move on their own accord. I stared down at Adam, thrusting myself against his mouth and devouring the ravenousness glint in his eyes. A delicious pressure built, tightening and pulsing with need. My movements became harder, faster. Moans slipped from my lips as I tiptoed the edge of ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, Chante.\u201d</p><p>As if my body reacted to Adam\u2019s command, the floodgates opened and my body was dizzy with the high of the orgasm shooting through my center. Adam\u2019s tongue didn\u2019t stop until my body slumped, exhausted. I smiled down at him\u2014amazed at the way he was able to work my body into a pile of goo.</p><p>He rested his hands on either side of my waist and lifted, positioning me over his erection. I bent down and kissed him, needing to taste his lips, only to gasp when he thrust deep inside of me, pausing before repeating the process.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so fucking good wrapped around my cock,\u201d he all but growled. Adam\u2019s colorful language was new to me, and I was surprised to find how much it turned me on. He thrust his hips upward, driving faster and harder into my wetness. Bracing myself on his chest, I dug my nails into his skin.</p><p>Adam sat up, wrapping an arm around my waist to hold me in place. His mouth clamped around my breast, his tongue stroking my erect nipple. I worked my hips against his and moaned when his teeth worried my nipple. That delicious heat was building again, causing exciting tingles in my stomach. When Adam gripped my hips and moved them against his in hard pulls, that yummy heat spilled forward in yet another earth-shattering orgasm. I could feel Adam coming at the same time; the slight pulsing of his dick amplified my own pleasure.</p><p>Our movements slowed, and I rested my forehead against his as we caught our breaths. Adam guided his mouth to mine, kissing me slowly.</p><p>\u201cI will never get used to how fucking good you feel, Chante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Sounds echoed from the kitchen, alerting us that the house was starting to wake up. Outside my bedroom door, the world was waiting for us. Adam and I sighed in unison, both wishing we could stay wrapped around each other\u2019s bodies instead of dealing with our responsibilities.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick this back up tonight,\u201d Adam promised.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>I\u2019d just gotten into my truck when Anthony stepped out of the house. Our eyes met like two magnets pulled toward each other. My fingers tightened around the steering wheel in a death grip, and my wolf bristled inside of me. I still couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d just popped up after what had happened. The sun played across his face, highlighting his blond hair and eyes. He started forward, and I fumbled to turn the key and start the truck. My hands trembled with my anger, and the keys fell from my hand to the floorboard. I reached between my legs, retrieved them, and let out a shriek when Anthony\u2019s face appeared in my driver\u2019s side window. This wasn\u2019t Wade\u2019s idea of \u201cplaying it cool\u201d.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d I said, trying to pull off nonchalance. The slight bend in Anthony\u2019s lips told me he wasn\u2019t fooled.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were going into town,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cDo you mind if I tag along? I need to pick something up.\u201d</p><p>I could learn a thing or two about nonchalance from him. How could he stand in front of me and act like he hadn\u2019t kidnapped me and watched as Eve abused me? His face was slack and free of emotion, but his eyes couldn\u2019t shield the truth of our history together. Silence settled between us as I thought of what to do. On one hand, Adam would flip the hell out if he found out I was alone with his brother, but on the other, Wade wanted me to get close to him and find out the truth. I stared ahead, almost hoping one of the busy pack members would look in my direction, tell Adam, and I\u2019d be saved from having to make the decision. When that didn\u2019t happen, I turned toward Anthony and hesitated to speak. The answer was on the tip of my tongue, but my wolf was wary to voice it. Maggie\u2019s comment about me being the downfall to everything Adam had worked for stuck in my head. If I agreed to take Anthony into town, it could be a ploy to try to kill me. The best way to take his brother down was through me, and he knew it. But how would I know if I didn\u2019t try to get a vision? Maybe Anthony\u2019s sights were set on Adam. I would never forgive myself if I could have prevented his death.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I heard myself saying. Anthony smiled and walked around the front of the truck. I watched him in what seemed like slow motion. Had I really just agreed to be alone with him? I was already regretting it, and we hadn\u2019t even left yet.</p><p>He hopped into the cab of the truck and said, \u201cThank you. I know being around me isn\u2019t easy. That\u2019s part of the reason why I wanted to come. I want to apologize for my behavior.\u201d</p><p>I stuck the key into the ignition and turned it. I couldn\u2019t respond, not yet. As I pulled out of the drive, Adam came bounding out of the house. I had one of two options: stop the truck so Adam could haul his brother out, or gun it and ignore the blast of fury radiating into my body through our bond. My eyes volleyed between Adam and Anthony until the decision made itself. I continued to drive, needing to hear what Anthony had to say. I gave Adam my best apologetic look and hoped like hell he would forgive me. I better not have just signed our death certificates.</p><p>\u201cAnna!\u201d Adam screamed.</p><p>I looked in the rearview mirror to find him standing at the end of the drive. I quickly tilted the mirror down and away from the look of hurt on his face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little protective of you, huh?\u201d Anthony joked.</p><p>\u201cFor good reason,\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou and Eve tried killing me just weeks ago.\u201d Hearing myself say it aloud was like a smack in the face. Realization overwhelmed me. My heartbeat echoed in my eardrums. The truck slowed until we were just idling in the middle of the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d I said to myself, looking over at Anthony. I hated\u2014absolutely hated\u2014that he looked so much like Adam.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d I said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Anthony said, turning in his seat to face me. \u201cI know what I did was horrendous. I\u2019m not asking you to forget about it, but I want you to know that I am sorry, whether you believe it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you had any morals at all you wouldn\u2019t have kidnapped me and watched while Eve beat the shit out of me.\u201d I took a shaky breath. \u201cYou just ... stood there. What kind of person does that?\u201d I never thought I\u2019d rejoice in someone\u2019s death, but I was elated that Eve was gone. If she were buried on the mountain, I would have made a daily visit to spit on her grave. I know how horrible that sounds, and that we\u2019re supposed to respect the dead, but Eve didn\u2019t deserve my, or anyone else\u2019s, respect. Countless families were affected by the murder of their loved ones, all because Eve had more than a few screws loose. And Anthony was right there by her side watching\u2014maybe even joining in\u2014while the humans were ripped apart by sharp teeth and claws. I\u2019d felt the sheer pleasure of her kills through our bond. She not only enjoyed it, she craved it. It was unspeakable and made me sick to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cLove makes you do crazy things,\u201d Anthony said, now looking ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was about her, but whenever I was around her, I lost myself.\u201d He looked over at me, his hazel eyes apologetic. \u201cI came here to make amends, Anna. I don\u2019t want to be that person anymore.\u201d</p><p>I watched him warily. \u201cA normal person\u2014with a sane mind\u2014couldn\u2019t just stand by and allow those things to happen, Anthony. You may have loved her, but don\u2019t for one second think I believe you didn\u2019t enjoy killing as much as she did.\u201d</p><p>Anthony was quiet for a long time. So much so that the muscles in my body were beginning to grow sore from readying myself in case he attacked. When he looked over at me again, his face had changed from pained to a stoic calm. He tilted his head to the side just an inch and studied me before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Adam who saved you.\u201d</p><p>My mouth hung agape as I struggled for a response. \u201cYes, it was.\u201d I remembered him rescuing me like it was yesterday. I\u2019d been so depressed and hopeless that, when he bust down the door to my prison, I thought he was an angel. I still remembered burying my head against his chest while he carried me away from that hell and the chaos that was breaking out around us. He walked right out, never losing his grip on me.</p><p>\u201cNot from Eve\u2019s lair,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cFrom Eve finishing you off. It wasn\u2019t Adam on the mountain that day; it was I. Eve would have killed you had I not stopped her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The day I was attacked and turned into a werewolf was something I would never forget. The pieces slowly came back to me a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s how I learned Eve was the one responsible for my hairy transformation every full moon. It was also the reason why I was able to see her kills through dreams. Whatever my gift, it was the strongest with her because she changed me. Her feelings washed through me and caused my wolf to hate humans just as much. So much so that the Leaders suspected I was the murderer.</p><p>\u201cYou may not have let her finish me off, but you didn\u2019t save me. You left me for dead on the mountain. If Adam wouldn\u2019t have found me, I would have bled out and died.\u201d That he was trying to claim a gold star for something Adam did pissed me off. I remember thinking Anthony was beautiful while I lay dying at his feet. Now that I knew what kind of person he was, there was nothing beautiful about him.</p><p>Anthony let out a humorless laugh. \u201cEveryone thinks Adam\u2019s the golden boy.\u201d He opened the truck door and got out, slamming it behind him. He stood beside the truck for a moment, looking off in the distance. \u201cAsk him,\u201d he said, bringing his gaze back to me. \u201cAsk him how he happened to miraculously be at the right place and time to save your life.\u201d He gave me one last look before he turned and headed back toward the house. I turned in my seat to watch him and gasped when I saw Adam\u2019s truck kicking up dust.</p> <p>I hopped out of the truck when Adam stopped in the middle of the street. He raced toward Anthony so fast; they went down in a ball of muscles and blond hair. Adam pinned Anthony to the ground, his fist striking his brother\u2019s face so hard, a sickening crack sounded.</p><p>\u201cAdam, stop!\u201d I rushed forward, pulling on his shoulders. Anthony had a cut above his right eye. A small trickle of blood ran down his face. Adam jumped up off him.</p><p>\u201cStay the fuck away from her,\u201d Adam yelled, pointing a finger toward his brother. \u201cIf you want to take me down, do it face to face, you coward.\u201d</p><p>I took a step back, speechless and a little afraid. I\u2019d seen Adam riled up, but he was downright pissed off. His entire body radiated anger and washed into my own body. I felt just how tightly wound he was. I was afraid that if Anthony so much as spoke, Adam would make sure they were his last words.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I said, coming to stand in front of him. I reached up and cupped his face, forcing him to look at me. \u201cAdam, I\u2019m okay. He just wanted to talk.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony began to get up behind me, and Adam\u2019s eyes shifted over my shoulder. He started forward, but I shoved against him. \u201cLook at me,\u201d I ordered. Adam\u2019s eyes slowly found mine. The edges were tinged in gold, and his body was rock hard beneath my hands. His face softened a hint while he stared at me, but I could feel the volcano simmering beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you, Brother,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>Adam stared over me at his twin. \u201cIf you mess with her,\u201d he nodded down to me, \u201cthen there\u2019s going to be a fight. If you so much as talk to her again, it\u2019ll be the last thing you ever do, Brother.\u201d</p><p>Anthony snorted. \u201cAnd I thought I was hard up for Eve.\u201d</p><p>Adam shoved forward, and I did my best to keep him in place. Had I not been standing between the two brothers, Anthony would be a smudge on the road right now. Adam wouldn\u2019t tolerate me blocking his path for too much longer. The fury racing through his body bombarded my mind and left me on edge. I had to calm him down before he did something he would regret\u2014and I helped him. So, I did the first thing that popped into my head. I wrapped my arms around his neck and reached up to kiss him. I didn\u2019t bother with taking my time. My tongue slipped into his mouth as my lips worked feverishly to occupy his mind. His mouth moved against mine, but not with its usual vigor. I opened my eyes to find him staring at his brother. Annoyed, I fisted handfuls of his hair and tugged his head. When he looked down at me, I quirked a threatening eyebrow. He smiled against my mouth and snaked an arm around my waist. He bent slightly as he lifted me up so that my feet dangled inches off the ground. When he began kissing me, I could feel his anger ebbing.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d I said against his lips.</p> <p>He took a deep breath and sat me back down. He cupped my face and placed a kiss on my forehead. \u201cVery clever using my affections for you against me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m all about keeping the peace.\u201d</p><p>Adam wrapped an arm around my shoulders and held me against his side. Anthony stood just eight feet from us. The cut on his face had already stopped bleeding. I watched him as he watched me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Dad says,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou and I will never be okay.\u201d</p><p>Anthony nodded and glanced at the ground before looking back at us. \u201cI could have killed her, Adam. It would have been so easy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Adam started forward again, and I groaned, annoyed that Anthony was riling him up after I just got him calmed down. Anthony held out a hand to hold back his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to make a point. I had enough time to kill her, and I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t even touch her. You may have taken the woman I loved from me, but I\u2019m not here for retribution, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Adam snorted. \u201cRight, you\u2019re here to make amends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m not here for\u2014convincing your stubborn ass about my motives. Believe what you want. I\u2019ll be gone after the summit.\u201d Anthony began to walk away.</p><p>I stepped forward and called his name. When he turned around I said, \u201cWe\u2019re even now. You saved my life. I just saved yours.\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth quirked up. \u201cI suppose we are.\u201d He turned back around and started walking again.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Adam asked, coming to my side.</p><p>I watched Anthony\u2019s back. \u201cHe told me to ask you how you found me on the mountain, and that he was the one that saved me.\u201d I looked up at Adam. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have needed saving if he didn\u2019t let Eve attack you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did, and I would have died had you not found me,\u201d I said. \u201cDid he have something to do with you finding me?\u201d</p><p>Adam blew a heavy breath through his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d When I couldn\u2019t remember who attacked me, Adam had said he suspected it was Eve. Up until that time, he pretended not to know anything about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you lie to me about that when you knew I wanted to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know now,\u201d Adam said. \u201cEve was the one who changed you, and she\u2019s dead now. What does it matter who\u2019s responsible for saving you?\u201d</p><p>He had a point. The most important thing was that I was found, and I survived. So why did I feel like the pretty picture inside my head was fading? As a girl who never believed in destiny or any of the mushy shit, I wanted to believe it with Adam. I knew we were supposed to be together\u2014the brands on our hands proved that\u2014but something inside of me thought it was that bond that drew him into the mountains to find me, like fate was directing us to each other. I snorted at the absurdity of it all.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me, Adam?\u201d</p><p>He released a heavy breath, his shoulders sagging. \u201cI got a phone call. Someone said they had seen a woman being attacked and that you were close to death.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened slightly, and I turned to look at Anthony\u2019s fading body. \u201cWas it Anthony?\u201d Knowing that he would go through the trouble of calling someone called everything I thought about him into question. While he\u2019d done some very questionable things, maybe we all misjudged him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Adam placed his hands on my shoulders and stared into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019d recognize my brother\u2019s voice, Anna. It wasn\u2019t him. Don\u2019t let him play head games with you. He\u2019s not some prince charming riding in to rescue you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s you,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly, your horse is a Silverado.\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know you\u2019ve got your facts straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe facts you choose to tell me, that is.\u201d</p><p>Adam frowned and pulled me into the cocoon of his chest, wrapping his arms around my back. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to keep it from you, Chante. I just didn\u2019t think it was that important. I figured it was a rogue or wolf from another pack giving me a courtesy call.\u201d</p><p>I nodded against him. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \u201cIf it had been me, I wouldn\u2019t have thought anything about it either. I guess I was just surprised.\u201d</p><p>Adam leaned back so that he could see my face. I looked up at him and smiled. How could I ever think he and Anthony looked alike? Their features were the same, being twins and all, but there was an inner beauty in Adam\u2014a passionate confidence\u2014his brother didn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never keep anything from you, Chante.\u201d He kissed my forehead and clasped our left hands together so the scars met. \u201cWe\u2019re one\u2014a team. If you can believe in anything, believe in that\u2014in us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said a little confused. His speech seemed a little deep for a casual conversation. Sure I had accused him of lying about how he found me, but I knew Adam would never do anything to betray me.</p><p>\u201cYou promised me you\u2019d stay away from Anthony,\u201d Adam said, and I frowned. I had promised him, and it took exactly one day to break that promise. \u201cI\u2019m only asking you to be just as honest with me as I am with you.\u201d</p><p>If he was trying to make me feel like shit, it was working. Adam had always been open about things with me. The least I could do was show him the same respect.</p><p>\u201cI had a good reason for breaking that promise,\u201d I told him. He did something I hadn\u2019t expected\u2014he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear it.\u201d</p><p>I proceeded to tell him about Wade\u2019s plan, and that we were doing it to help him. When I was done, Adam turned slightly and looked off into the distance. He shook his head back and forth and his right hand curled into a fist. When he spun to face me, his eyes were as hard as steel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Wade,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cHe put you in harm\u2019s way for his own selfish reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... no, he didn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWe did it to find out what Anthony was planning, and I didn\u2019t even get a chance to see anything from him.\u201d I was still annoyed with myself that I hadn\u2019t tried to touch his hand or something to see if could summon a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s planning something,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou think he\u2019s okay with me killing Eve? He\u2019s not going to let that go. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you anywhere near him.\u201d</p> <p>We were at an impasse, but I was not going to tell Adam that. I understood why he wanted me to stay away from him. It wouldn\u2019t go against Anthony\u2019s character to kill me to get back at Adam. Still I could not shake my curiosity at finding out if we were right or not. I knew Anthony had his bad moments, but why hadn\u2019t he tried to hurt me in the truck? Did he know Adam was on our tail, and he wouldn\u2019t have enough time? Maybe he was trying to gain my trust in order to fool me later. Not knowing was driving me crazy. I couldn\u2019t continue to walk around with him in our midst and not do anything about it. If he was planning an attack, and I could get a glimpse into his mind, then that\u2019s what I had to do.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to be mad at someone, be mad at me. I\u2019m the one who broke the promise,\u201d I told him. I slid my arms around his waist, clasping my hands behind his back. \u201cWade really was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, my adorably frustrating mate, I find it hard to stay mad at you. One look into your eyes and my resolve crumbles, so I have to direct it at the other person involved.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him. \u201cWell, then, please forgive us for scheming behind your back. It was done innocuously.\u201d</p><p>Adam cupped my face and brought his lips down to mine for a soft kiss. He leaned his forehead against mine and exhaled a heavy breath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the world am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the rest of your life to figure it out.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>After the drama with Anthony and Adam, I made it into town. It was my job to pick up enough paper plates, napkins, and plastic cups to supply the arriving crowd. I piled packages of each into my cart, pushing it down the aisle in an uninterested daze. Tonight was my alpha ceremony. Tonight, I would be the first made-wolf to rise to elite status, and all of the surrounding packs would stand witness to it. I felt like vomiting. While my pack had shown me nothing but respect, I wasn\u2019t so sure the visiting wolves would. And now that I knew my Chante was from olde blood, it only made our pairing that much more difficult. Not to mention his mother wanted me gone. Would she interrupt the alpha ceremony tonight, embarrass me in front of everyone? Would Chloe or Cadie challenge me to claim my spot?</p><p>Relationships never used to be this difficult. Why couldn\u2019t Adam be a regular guy with regular parents and regular problems? I\u2019d gone twenty-three years without succumbing to the mushiness of relationships. Most of my dates had consisted of some guy trying to sweet-talk me while I silently prayed for an asteroid to crash into whatever diner we were at. It all made sense now, the reason why none of my beaus worked out before. I\u2019d been waiting for Adam all along. It was like my soul knew he was out there, somewhere, waiting for me, too.</p><p>Two weeks ago we\u2019d been blissfully happy, too engrossed in each other to face the bigger issues. And to be honest, Adam was still in that state. I saw it every time he looked at me. Touched me. Kissed me. The issues were sitting solely on my shoulders. He was the prince in this story and I the waif he\u2019d fallen for. God, it sounded like some bad Lifetime movie\u2014only with a lot more hair and teeth. Maggie\u2019s words haunted me. I wanted to shrug it off as nothing more than a snooty woman not thinking I was good enough for her baby boy. If only it were that easy. I could deal with bitchy in-laws and their upturned noses. What I couldn\u2019t handle, what tortured my mind, was the fact that I was worse than a poor girl who\u2019d captured the prince\u2019s heart; I was a liability.</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a moment and sucked in a deep breath through my nose. When I exhaled, I imagined all of my problems floating out of me. I couldn\u2019t worry about this shit right now ... not when Anthony was in our midst. When Adam rescued me from Eve\u2019s torture chamber, Anthony had promised it wasn\u2019t over between the two of them. For some reason, I wanted to believe we\u2019d all misjudged Anthony. Maybe it was my mind\u2019s way of hoping everything would be okay. I could pretend for only a second, though. I knew Anthony had a motive. I also knew how much he loved Eve, though I couldn\u2019t understand why. I\u2019d never met anyone so disturbed in my life. I still thought of the humans she\u2019d killed. Their screams echoed in my head when I remembered the dreams. With Eve out of the picture, I couldn\u2019t fathom Anthony not wanting retribution for her death. Like he\u2019d said before\u2014\u201clove makes you do crazy things.\u201d</p><p>I shook away my thoughts and tried to concentrate on the shopping list Elle had given me. Focusing on something so normal was a nice change of pace. I placed more paper plates into the cart, the fancy ones, per Elle\u2019s instructions. She was making a huge deal out of the visitors, as though the Queen was visiting. Maybe it was my young age and lack of pack dynamics, but I didn\u2019t get it. So far, all the new wolves I\u2019d met had been either pretentious or slutty. If it were up to me we\u2019d be eating hotdogs off the grill with cheap beer and generic chips. Adam was impressive in his own right\u2014freaking royalty. They should be catering to him. Fanning him with banana leaves and shit. I giggled at the thought, and a woman next to me eyed me with wariness. I smiled sweetly at her, and she quickly averted her eyes, feigning interest in flushable wipes.</p><p>I headed down the aisle. Making a detour to the dairy section, I picked up a tub of whip cream. Maybe if I made a bikini out of it like in Varsity Blues, Adam would be tempted to lick each sweet dollop off me. My wolf purred with anticipation.</p><p>Back at the house, I lugged the multiple bags into the kitchen and set them on the table. The house was fuller than before. Wolves occupied every inch of the space. In the living room, the sectional was full of them as they watched EPSN on our flatscreen. Elle stood by the sink, her hip resting against the counter as she talked to a woman with an auburn bob. The woman smiled and laughed at something Elle said, making me smile, too. I wanted so badly for her to find someone to share her life with. She was too great of a person to spend it alone, cooking for an army of wolves.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Elle says, seeing me for the first time. \u201cThis is Jill Baker, a wolf from the Nevada pack.\u201d Elle stared at her, besotted. Blinking, she remembers herself and looks at me again. \u201cAnd, this is the slave driver, Anna,\u201d she said to Jill.</p><p>I scoff. \u201cSlave driver? Who sent me all the way into town to pick up supplies?\u201d I retrieved one of the packages of paper plates from the bag and held it up. \u201cI think you might be a tad OCD, Elle.\u201d</p><p>Elle came across the kitchen to pluck the plates from my hand. \u201cThese are the strongest ones.\u201d She held up the package. \u201cAnd they\u2019re even pretty to look at.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head with a laugh, ignoring her obsession with disposable dishes. I stepped around her and held out my hand to Jill.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jill clasped my hand and smiled. She was a good two inches taller than I was and had eyes the color of scotch, a perfect balance of caramel and brown. Her thin nose sloped at a flawless angle, and her Cupid\u2019s bow lips were full and as red as a poppy.</p><p>\u201cAnna Avery,\u201d she breathed, clasping my hand and giving it a gentle shake. Releasing me, she stared almost in awe. Light sparkled in her eyes, and that friendly smile spread across her lips again. \u201cYou\u2019re all the rage back in Nevada. A frickin\u2019 rockstar!\u201d</p><p>I laughed, thinking she was joking. She wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMy sisters have been counting down the day until they meet you, and we also get to witness your alpha ceremony.\u201d Jill paused to suck in an excited breath. I cast a glance at Elle, unsure whether I should be worried or flattered.</p><p>\u201cThe girls in Nevada seem to think because of you, they too, will get a chance at their happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips in confusion. \u201cI hope they do, too,\u201d I said. \u201cBut why would I have any part in that?\u201d</p><p>Jill reached for my left hand and turned it so my palm faced upward. \u201cBecause of this.\u201d She tapped my scar\u2014a four-leaf clover pattern with an infinity symbol across it. \u201cYou\u2019re proof that things are changing in the packs\u2014that us made wolves can become more than mistresses.\u201d She beamed again, as though her excitement was too vast to contain in such a slim frame. \u201cYou\u2019ve given them hope that they could one day snag their own alpha.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows arched so high that the skin on my forehead felt like it\u2019d been stretched over a drum.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a real life fairytale come true,\u201d she all but squealed. I half expected her to clasp both of my hands and start jumping up and down in hopes I\u2019d join in on her merriment. My life just kept getting more and more bizarre.</p><p>\u201cUm ... cool,\u201d I said because I couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.</p><p>Elle laughed. \u201cJill, you\u2019re lucky Anna hasn\u2019t come into her alpha status yet, otherwise you\u2019d be doing all of that squirming under the pressure of her teeth.\u201d</p><p>Jill stilled, her eyes widening in horror. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she gasped. \u201cShe\u2019s right, you\u2019re an alpha\u2014or soon to be alpha\u2014and here I am treating you like a regular Betty. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>My eyes darted to Elle\u2019s face, and I scowled at her. She laughed, raising and lowering her arms in a mock bow. I was finding it difficult to keep the smile off my face so I turned to face Jill. I gripped both of her hands and gave her a reassuring smile.</p><p>\u201cElle is just screwing with you,\u201d I told her. \u201cThere is no need to walk on eggshells around me. I\u2019m no more important than you and would appreciate it if you treated me as such.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cModest and beautiful,\u201d Jill almost sighed. Sighed, for the love of God. Was she crushing on me? I unwound my fingers from hers and took a step back. I know I should have been flattered that the girls in Nevada looked up to me, but all I felt was more pressure weighing down on my shoulders. They would be analyzing everything I did in hopes of catching on and snagging their own alpha. Maybe I should write a book titled: How to Bring that Alpha to His Knees\u2014The Anna Avery Story. Or become the wolf whisperer\u2014a fucking love guru.</p><p>I silently wondered how much they\u2019d look up to me if one of the slut twins decided to challenge me, and I lost. Would they want their own alpha and all the drama it entails then? And I hadn\u2019t just snagged an alpha; I\u2019d snagged an olde blood. Mo\u2019 money, mo\u2019 problems, I thought with my own amusement.</p><p>\u201cJill, if you\u2019ll excuse us,\u201d Elle said coming to my rescue. \u201cI have to prepare Anna for the ceremony.\u201d She laced her arm through mine, and together we headed toward my bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jill called after us. \u201cI\u2019ll just ... mingle with the others.\u201d</p><p>When my door clicked shut, I released the breath I\u2019d been holding. My shoulders eased, and all of a sudden I felt ... exhausted. I plopped back on my bed, my arms falling over my head. I stared up at the ceiling, my mind awash with thoughts, each clamoring for attention. Find out what Anthony is up to. Adam\u2019s life is in your hands. Train to strengthen your visions. Put on your grr face to scare away the bitches sniffing around. Learn to fight in case you\u2019re challenged. And, above all else, don\u2019t let them know how much all of this is freaking you out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d I said, sitting up. For a girl terrified of commitment, I\u2019d been thrust into the biggest commitment of all\u2014alpha female. I wanted Adam ... without a doubt. Needed him. It was his baggage that had me itching to run away.</p><p>Elle knelt in front of me. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d She clasped my hands and smiled up at me. Her copper hair was up in a bun today. Tendrils spilled from its hold, flowing over her bare shoulders. It broke my heart to see how much faith she put in me. Her bright green eyes watched me with compassion.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand how monumental this ceremony is?\u201d Elle asked. \u201cJill may be a little overzealous at times, but she\u2019s right. You\u2019re changing everything. You\u2019re the voice of the common wolves\u2014our hope.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are, Anna,\u201d she said, using my words against me. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, you even changed the Leaders\u2019 minds. No wolf has ever done that.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her dubiously. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? The Leaders hated me, with the exception of Wade. They almost sentenced me to a lifetime of servitude with the Idaho pack.\u201d I took a breath. \u201cHad it not been for Adam and me bonding, they would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe eyes, Anna,\u201d Elle said, gripping my hands tighter. \u201cThey\u2019d only just met you and already they vetoed their rule about looking them in the eyes. Why? Who were you to them then? You and Adam weren\u2019t bonded yet.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her dumbfounded. \u201cI ...\u201d I\u2019d never really thought about it. From the beginning, I never cowered under Adam\u2019s stare. Why would I with the Leaders? Maybe they sensed that within me\u2014knew that my wolf would not cower under the weight of anyone\u2019s stare.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that they wanted to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Elle blew out a breath, throwing her arms up in exasperation. \u201cAnna, wake up,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAll of the signs point to your potential to be great, a wolf for our history books. You were made for this.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed around the lump in my throat. What if I failed? What if my failure resulted in Adam\u2019s death? I was no longer just in charge of my own fate. What if ...</p><p>\u201cSo why do I feel like everyone is just waiting for me to crumble?\u201d I saw it every time I met someone\u2019s eyes. My own pack watched me with curiousness, as though they\u2019d betted when I would crack and were just waiting to collect their bounty. Some of the visiting wolves watched me with sympathy as though my fairytale was about to end, while others watched me with contempt. What Elle said was a pretty idea, but it didn\u2019t come with pretty conditions. The phrase thrown to the wolves, held a literal meaning for me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for you to step up and embrace your wolf, Anna,\u201d Elle said. I looked up at her. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting,\u201d she added, coming to sit down beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re the white wolf, the made wolf that captured the prince\u2019s heart. You\u2019ve already made history, and you haven\u2019t even come into your own yet.\u201d She laughed to herself. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what happens once you do.\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped down my cheek, too overwhelmed with her assurance to hold it in. Elle slung an arm around my shoulders and pulled me into her. She leaned her head against mine, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than you give yourself credit for. You just have to believe in yourself as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>I swiped the tear away, shaking my head. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I told her. \u201cI have to put on my grr face and not second guess myself.\u201d</p><p>Elle laughed. \u201cExactly. Convey with your eyes that\u2019ll you\u2019ll cut a bitch if she even sniffs in your mate\u2019s direction. Make them second-guess everything they thought they knew about you, my lean, mean, alpha-bitch Queen.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cWhat would I do without you, seriously?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you would be a mess. A complete and utter mess.\u201d She bumped my shoulder playfully. \u201cNow, let\u2019s get you ready for the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>My lungs constricted, making it hard to breathe. I concentrated on putting one foot in front of the other, the drag of my long, white silk gown against the grass, and the beautiful man awaiting me up front. Anything but the weight of eyes that was pressing down on me, or the abusive slam of my heart. I wasn\u2019t ready for this, but then, would I ever be?</p><p>Elle spent the last hour and half doing my hair, makeup, and tried her best to make me laugh. Her company had helped, but now that it was time, all of that relaxation left my body, and I was as tightly wound as I\u2019d been before.</p><p>Whoever set up the ceremony had done an awesome job. I walked down an aisle lined with pots of pink and white roses. Twinkle lights crisscrossed over my head, illuminating my face. White chairs sat on either side of the raised stage, too many to count. All of the wolves were here, faces I didn\u2019t recognize or hadn\u2019t met yet. The sky was twilight. Purple and orange smeared across the clouds, lending a beautiful backdrop.</p><p>Two women in midnight blue gowns held flutes to their lips, serenading the ceremony attendees. The music was so gentle, just a whisper of wind instruments, but it soaked through me. My wolf metaphorically puffed up her chest at the Native American tune. Pride leaked through me and helped me down the aisle. Elle and Jill were right; this was history in the making. I was a made wolf on her way to becoming an alpha. I held my chin high, relishing in my wolf\u2019s strength. While I\u2019d been unsure about where I belonged and what I could handle, she\u2019d never wavered in knowing this was right where she was supposed to be. From day one, she thought of herself as an alpha, and now she would be\u2014we would be.</p><p>I clenched my gown as I ascended the stairs to the stage. Adam was waiting for me with an outstretched hand. My eyes found the mark on his palm, and all semblance of doubt washed away. I clasped his hand and allowed him to lead me to the center. My pack circled around us, knelt on one knee with their heads bowed. My lungs no longer constricted, but my heart did. If there was one sure way to humble a girl, it was this moment. Tears stung my eyes, but I kept my chin high and my face blank. I could not break down, not before the ceremony even started.</p><p>\u201cI am honored to share this moment with you my friends,\u201d Adam began. He was wearing ivory linen pants and nothing else. His chest gleamed against the golden hue of the falling sun. When he looked over at me with pride-filled eyes, my own blurred more.</p><p>\u201cTo find one\u2019s soul mate is a legend we long thought was lost,\u201d Adam continued, looking out into the audience. \u201cAs wolves, we breed and mate all in the name of forming alliances. But love rarely fits into the equation.\u201d He looked over at me again, squeezing my hand in reassurance. I tried for a smile, but it felt shaky on my lips. I will not cry. I will not cry. I will not cry.</p><p>\u201cI am not a man who experiences insecurities,\u201d Adam said with a smile. A hushed round of laughter circled around the crowd. \u201cBut when Anna walked into my life she caused just that.\u201d</p><p>Hmm, that didn\u2019t sound good.</p><p>\u201cI was raised with one way of thinking, and this woman,\u201d he signaled to me. \u201cThis beautiful, stubborn woman knocked me off my axis. The mere sight of her caused me to call everything I knew into question. We are each born with a piece missing, and it\u2019s only through the sheer design of fate that we find that missing link. Anna is mine\u2014the piece that makes me whole.\u201d Adam stared into the audience. Aside from the soft music, silence settled over the ceremony as though everyone was holding his or her breath. I know I was holding mine.</p><p>\u201cTo know that sort of love, that completeness,\u201d Adam paused. \u201cI wish that for each and every one of you. So when I say that I am honored for all of you to stand witness to one of the most important rituals of my life, I say it with truth and humbled pride.\u201d Adam bowed to the crowd. I wasn\u2019t sure if I should follow suit or not ... maybe curtsy? I nodded my head slowly instead, hoping I hadn\u2019t offended anyone.</p><p>Adam leaned into me and whispered in my ear. \u201cI have never seen you look more beautiful, my Chante.\u201d</p><p>All I could do was nod. My voice left with my breath. My legs trembled beneath my dress, and a single tear escaped and slipped down my cheek. With a soft graze, Adam brushed the drop away, pressing a kiss to my forehead.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and managed to whisper, \u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam must have given the orders telepathically because Elle and Joe stood from their bent positions and came to me. I noticed all of the men were dressed like Adam: linen pants and nothing else, whereas the women were sheathed in swaths of steely gray silk. Elle and Joe both smiled at me, but did not say a word. Together they undressed me, slipping the silk gown off my body so that I stood in my bra and underwear. Thank goodness I\u2019d known about this part and had made sure to wear some decent underwear. I kept my eyes forward, not allowing my modesty to ruin this moment for me. At least I wasn\u2019t naked in front of all of these people. Once Elle and Joe were done, they took their places back in the circle.</p><p>The drums grew louder and louder, mimicking the rapid beat of my heart. My pack began to fidget around me, their bodies writhing almost sensually. Clothes began to shred from their bodies as their wolves pushed forward. Within moments, a pack of wolves surrounded me. They sat waiting, their heads tipped back so that their noses faced the now dark sky. A cool breeze whipped across my stomach causing the hairs on the back of my neck to stand on end.</p><p>My gaze shifted when a group of women ascended the stage, each holding a small clay bowl. They formed a circle around me and knelt down, placing the bowls in front of the wolves. When each wolf had a clay pot sitting in front of him or her, the women disappeared off the stage. My eyes found the icy stare of Maggie and Donald. They sat in the front row, Anthony beside them. Maggie arched a sculpted brow at me, her displeasure loud and clear. Donald\u2019s face was all hard lines and scorn. His jaw was clenched so tight; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he cracked a few teeth. Anthony, on the other hand, smiled and winked at me, but there was something mischievous in his eyes that put me on edge.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here tonight to pledge our loyalty to you, Anna,\u201d Adam said, coming to stand beside me. I smiled down at him, that tingly warmth bursting through my stomach. \u201cEach wolf is here on their own accord. They have acknowledged you as their alpha female and wish to give themselves to you, as do I.\u201d</p><p>My smile turned into a cheesy grin, and I had to restrain myself so I didn\u2019t look like a teenager who\u2019d just been asked to prom by her crush. Grinning like a fool wouldn\u2019t help the witnessing wolves change their minds about my ability to rise to alpha status. I had to be serious and controlled. The smile slipped from my lips and straightened into a straight line while I looked ahead, chin held high.</p><p>\u201cLet the ceremony begin,\u201d Adam announced. He reached out a hand to me and helped me descend the small stage I stood on. Together, we walked over and stopped in front of Joe.</p><p>\u201cJoe, do you promise to protect and obey Anna Avery, putting her life before yours and others as your alpha female?\u201d</p><p>Joe, a salt and pepper wolf, lowered his head in a bow. When Adam nodded toward him, he dipped both of his paws into the clay bowl and stepped toward me. Sitting on his hind legs, he pressed his paws against my stomach, leaving two perfect prints on my skin. I watched in awe as the red liquid slowly faded as though my body had absorbed them. Energy swirled through my body, causing my wolf to bristle beneath my skin.</p> <p>Adam moved me around the circle, asking each wolf the same question, and each one dipped their paws in the red liquid and stamped my body with their paw prints, only for my body to absorb them. By the end of the line, I was so amped up, I felt like I\u2019d taken a bunch of speed. Power surged through my veins like I was connected to a live wire.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Adam whispered in my ear as he helped me back onto the small stage.</p><p>I had to take a deep breath before answering\u2014afraid if I didn\u2019t, my response would come out as a squeal. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d He winked, and all of that energy racing through my veins headed between my legs. All of my senses amplified, my sudden desire for Adam caused my panties to dampen. Realizing that there was a huge crowd watching us, I tried to reign in my desire. Easier said than done, especially since Adam was stripping out of his linen pants. A couple females in the crowd whistled, and I growled in response, my eyes zeroing in on the admiring females. The clarity of my vision told me that my wolf was waiting right at the surface. I was sure my eyes were burning orange as I searched out the women ogling Adam.</p><p>When a hand brushed the small of my back, I looked down to find Adam smirking at me, an almost proud sparkle dancing in his eyes. With a wink, he shifted, and an ebony wolf now stood in front of me. He was huge, his shoulders coming to my feet on the stage. Adam dipped his paws in a clay pot, and just as he was about to place them on my body, a whizzing sound caught both of our attentions. Adam faltered, his ear perking up as he looked toward where the sound was coming. A deep growl echoed up his throat as he opened his mouth and roared. Momentarily distracted by his anger, when I looked up, it was at the silvery sharp edge of a broad-head arrow sailing right for me.</p><p>Adam leapt up, knocking me over right before the arrow found its way into my heart. I fell off the stage in a hard thump, Adam\u2019s wolf a mass of fur and teeth acting as my shield. The adrenaline from the pledging part of the ceremony surged through my body making any and all pain I\u2019d feel tomorrow nonexistent. But a tight wrenching in the pit of my stomach told me something was wrong with Adam. When he shuffled off me, I could see the cause of my panic. The arrow meant for me was sticking out of his side, buried at least four inches.</p> <p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I yelled, crawling on my knees. I ran my fingers through his long, dark fur and tried to move around him, but he nudged me back with is head. He stood at attention, ignoring the arrow and my worry. The surrounding wolves all formed a tight circle around us, and the witnessing wolves all scrambled to their feet. I wasn\u2019t sure if they knew what had happened, but it was evident enough that someone disrupted the ceremony.</p><p>Joe shifted beside me and grabbed my arm, trying to haul me up and away from Adam. I fought against him, needing to help Adam before another arrow found its way into his body. Through our bond, I could tell he was in a lot pain.</p><p>\u201cAdam wants you inside,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Using both hands, I shoved against Joe\u2019s body. \u201cToo fucking bad. He\u2019s been shot. He\u2019s the one who needs to get inside. The arrow could have punctured his organs.\u201d</p><p>Adam spun on me and bared his teeth, nodding with his head toward Joe.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh, not until you go inside, too. Let the pack figure out what happened. You\u2019re in no shape to go running after the shooter.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s black wolf made a sort of huffing nose, his eyes cutting to Joe. I didn\u2019t need to know what he was saying to his second-in-command to know it had to do with me.</p><p>\u201cSo help me, Joe, if you touch me, I\u2019m going to drop kick you in the balls.\u201d</p> <p>Joe\u2019s eyes widened as he looked from me to Adam. Now that he was pledged to both of us, Adam couldn\u2019t pull rank on me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, it\u2019s for your safety,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAdam wants you inside, please.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t paying attention to him or Adam. Movement in the distance caught my attention. A black figure scurried along the forest edge, disappearing through the trees. Anger coupled with my extra dose of energy caused my wolf to surge forward. Whoever the shooter was, they were still on my mountain and fair game.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>I leapt off the stage and took off running. I could feel two more wolves with me, but my focus was on the forest ahead. Whoever was lurking on my mountain was after me. That arrow was meant for my heart. The fact that they got Adam, instead of me, only pissed me off more. If someone wanted to kill me, fine, but in his or her failed process they\u2019d hurt my mate and, for that, I would make them pay.</p><p>My wolf pushed forward, her nails digging into the earth as she propelled herself onward. The wind whipped across our face and it smelled faintly of smoke and blood. As I reached the tree line, I came to a halt. Raising my head, I inhaled the spot I\u2019d seen the perpetrator. It didn\u2019t take long for my spidey senses to kick in and catch their scent. I edged through the trees, my eyes darting back and forth looking for any semblance of movement. The person couldn\u2019t have gotten far.</p><p>\u201cAnna, get your ass back here now.\u201d Adam\u2019s voice penetrated my mind and sounded as angry as I felt.</p><p>\u201cNo can do, sugar buns. Whoever shot at me is still on our mountain.\u201d A crack of branches sounded just left of me. My wolf let out a low growl. The two wolves that had followed flanked either side of me. With a quick look, I realized it was Elle and Joe. Though the ceremony had been interrupted, their pledge was complete. Trying something, I thought about what I wanted to say and tried to direct it toward Elle. I never understood how Adam communicated with us telepathically. I assumed it was one of those mysteries I\u2019d never understand.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes peeled to the left,\u201d I told Elle. To Joe, I said, \u201cEyes to the right.\u201d</p><p>Both of their ears perked in surprise of my voice being in their heads, but they bobbed their thick, furry heads in an agreeable nod. Together, we proceeded forward and in the direction of the sound.</p><p>\u201cI swear, if my life wasn\u2019t linked to yours, I\u2019d kill you myself,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cPft. And here I was thinking we were still in the honeymoon phase.\u201d I sent the message back with what I hoped was a humorous tone. It didn\u2019t take much to upset Adam, at least where my safety was concerned. As much as his possessiveness of me was a turn on, I wouldn\u2019t allow it to turn me into a damsel in distress. Sure, I wasn\u2019t the best fighter, but the power surging through my veins made me feel invincible. Whether it was a false sense of superiority, I had yet to find out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I sent the message to Adam. \u201cElle and Joe are with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because I ordered them to follow you,\u201d Adam responded. \u201cWhat rational person jumps headfirst into what could possibly be a trap? Just stay where you are; I\u2019m sending Asher, Sawyer, and Wade.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if wolves could roll their eyes, but I tried. Another sound echoed through the trees, this time to the left. Elle, Joe, and I all stopped and listened. I couldn\u2019t see anything except for trees, a raccoon, and a mouse scurrying along the forest floor. Both animals were too small to create the crack of branches we\u2019d heard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFan out,\u201d I told Elle and Joe. Hesitant to leave my side, they took a couple steps before stopping again. Annoyed with my bodyguards, I sent another message. \u201cFan out means separate.\u201d</p><p>A few more lingering moments later, Joe and Elle did as I asked. Together we pushed forward. A small breeze wove around the tree trunks, carrying with it an unfamiliar scent. My wolf inhaled, filling our lungs with the stale smell. I\u2019d been in the forest enough times to know that this thing\u2014whatever that scent was emanating from\u2014it didn\u2019t belong here.</p><p>A flash of black whizzed ahead of me. That was all the motivation my wolf needed. She lunged forward, leaping over downed trees and around low branches as she chased the shadow. The dark shape moved quickly, blending in with the pockets of darkness of the forest. The staleness in the air intensified. What the hell was that? I could see the shadow just ahead of me. I pushed forward, my wolf sprinting to catch whoever was lurking on our mountain. However, as I neared the shape, it ran up the base of a tall pine tree and disappeared from my view.</p> <p>Elle, Joe, and the others Adam sent joined me. We stared up at the tree in shock. What could fly up a tree and move that fast? Annoyed, I sent a message to the wolves to head back. There was no point in chasing shadows all night, plus I wanted to see how Adam was doing. Through our bond, I could feel his emotions, a mixture of annoyance, pain, and worry. It was making it difficult to focus on what I was doing.</p><p>Back at the house, I changed back into myself and strode into the house. Adam was lying on the sofa on his side while one of our wolves, Sunny, worked on removing the arrow from his thigh. Crouching down beside him, I ran a hand over his hair.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d I asked Sunny.</p><p>She cut the arrow with a pair of tin snips and handed the discarded piece to Wade who was standing to her left. She sat back on her heels and looked over at me. Her hair was as black as midnight, and her almond-shaped blue eyes held an emotion I didn\u2019t want to see\u2014worry.</p><p>\u201cThe tip is pure silver, Anna,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell how bad it is until I get the head out, but he\u2019s in a lot of pain.\u201d</p> <p>Someone placed a silk robe around my shoulders. I looked up to see Sawyer just behind me. Smiling my thanks, I threaded my arms through the robe and knotted the belt. I hadn\u2019t even realized I was naked\u2014not that the pack cared\u2014but Sawyer knew my disposition to nudity in front of them.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I said. He opened his eyes, relief washing through them. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. We\u2019ll get you something for the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t take anything for pain,\u201d Sunny said. \u201cOur metabolisms are too high, we burn drugs off too quickly.\u201d</p><p>Adam squeezed my hand and tugged me forward until my face was right in front of his. His fingers run up my nape and settled on the back of my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever run off like that again, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled. \u201cIf something happened, I couldn\u2019t get to you, Anna. Your place is beside me always. Do. Not. Run. Off.\u201d</p><p>I knew Adam was shaken up from the attack, and his anger was plausible, but being reprimanded in front of my entire pack plus some of the visiting wolves caused my wolf\u2019s hackles to rise in indignation.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said through tight lips. Adam tugged me closer until our mouths met. He kissed me hard, his lips moving against mine vigorously, almost painfully.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Sunny said.</p><p>Adam released his grip on my head and looked at her. I ran a hand across my swollen lips, embarrassed to meet the faces of the surrounding wolves.</p><p>\u201cI have to get the head out now,\u201d Sunny said, holding up a scalpel.</p><p>My stomach clenched, and my eyes volleyed between the blade and Adam\u2019s bare thigh. Droplets of blood still trickled out of the wound, increasing my queasiness.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Adam said tersely. He gripped my hand and dropped his head against the sofa. As Sunny got to work at removing the broad-head, Adam\u2019s eyes clenched tight, but his face was devoid of the pain he had to be feeling. His jaw was slack, not even a tick of muscles betrayed the control he was keeping.</p> <p>I leaned over him, running a hand through his hair to comfort him. I pressed soft kisses along his forehead and told him everything was going to be okay. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was trying to reassure him or myself.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep rubbing those beautiful breasts against my chest, that towel covering my lap isn\u2019t going to stay flat for long,\u201d Adam whispered, opening his eyes to look at me.</p><p>I smiled sheepishly. \u201cSorry, I was just trying to comfort you. I didn\u2019t mean to rub myself against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to rub yourself against me whenever you want, Chante, but let\u2019s wait until Sunny has the blade out so that she doesn\u2019t get an eye full of something else, yeah?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and smiled, leaning back so that I was sitting on my heels. I kept a hold of Adam\u2019s hand, but focused my attention on what Sunny was doing. I could see the end of the broad-head. Luckily, it hadn\u2019t buried itself deep into Adam\u2019s muscles. As a wolf, our muscles strengthen, making it harder for things like arrows and bullets to penetrate our bodies. We\u2019re not impenetrable, though, and the silver head had already done its damage.</p><p>Sunny pulled the arrow\u2019s head out slowly and gasped. The room grew still, the power buzzing through the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Donald asked, coming through the crowd to stand behind the sofa, Maggie just behind him. Her eyes weren\u2019t focused on Adam or his wound, though; they were too busy glaring at me. She shook her head, just a slight movement that said she blamed me for her son\u2019s injury. I held her eyes for a couple seconds longer before looking down at our joined hands.</p><p>\u201cThe head was tipped in liquid silver,\u201d Sunny said. \u201cIt\u2019s in his bloodstream.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t noticed before, but Sunny was wearing latex gloves. A small smear of silver tipped her pointer finger.</p><p>\u201cAnna, can I speak to you a moment?\u201d</p><p>I looked up, and Wade was standing right beside me. \u201cI need to stay with Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Adam said with a rasp in his voice. \u201cJust don\u2019t leave the house, understand?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and stood up, annoyed with his orders, but now was not the time to argue about his overbearing commands. Besides, had it been me that was shot and Adam took off, I would have acted the same way.</p><p>Standing, I leaned over, pressed a kiss to Adam\u2019s mouth, and then followed Wade up the stairs. Once we were in the office, Wade shut the door behind him and held out the discarded piece of the arrow Sunny had cut. When I reached for it, Wade lowered his hand.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you guys see anything in the forest?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and said, \u201cNot really. We heard noises, like footfalls, but whatever was making them was fast. All I could see was a black blur, and then it disappeared up a tree.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Wade\u2019s face tensed. \u201cDid you smell anything distinguishable?\u201d</p><p>By the look on his face, Wade already had an idea of what could have shot Adam. His entire being seemed to be holding its breath as he waited for me to answer.</p><p>\u201cStaleness,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the smell of being from the forest.\u201d</p><p>Wade\u2019s shoulders fell, and he shook his head. \u201cDammit. I was hoping I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I hugged my arms across my chest, suddenly exhausted. The adrenaline from the ceremony was waning. And I was worried about Adam and the silver coursing through his bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure what you saw was a vampire,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know why one would be interested in killing you or us. Vampires and werewolves aren\u2019t enemies like movies suggest, but we keep out of each other\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>Wade was quiet for a moment as he thought about something. I dissected what he told me\u2014just as surprised to find out I had been tracking a vampire. I was still new to the paranormal world.</p><p>\u201cYou think someone hired him or her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThe question is, who and why?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it? They want me out of the picture to either hurt Adam or take my spot.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts automatically went to Maggie and Donald, but they knew what my death would do to their son, and they wouldn\u2019t risk his life just to get me out of the picture. There was also Anthony, but something told me he wasn\u2019t the one responsible either.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Wade said, handing me the broken arrow. \u201cSee if you can get anything from this.\u201d</p><p>Curling my fingers around the thin aluminum cylinder, I closed my eyes and concentrated on getting a vision. Sparks of light danced behind my eyelids like an electric snowstorm, making it difficult to discern any one thing. I thought about Adam and how he\u2019d jumped in front of me to save my life, putting his own in jeopardy and about the black mass I\u2019d chased through the forest. Angered determination helped my mind clear the fuzziness away.</p><p>A black gloved hand loaded the arrow into the bow. The person raised the weapon up toward his or her face, getting me in sight. Leaves blew on nearby branches, momentarily obscuring the ceremony from the assailant\u2019s view. Waiting until the shot was perfect, stretching back his or her arm to pull the bowstring tight\u2014shot fired. The arrow sailed through the air like a torpedo, right on track to hit its target. As the arrow drew closer to the ceremony stage, Adam and I quirked our heads, hearing the disturbance in the air nearby.</p><p>The vision disappeared just as soon as it came. I blinked my eyes open, looking down at the arrow in my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you see?\u201d Wade asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing really,\u201d I told him. \u201cI saw the placement of the attacker and his or her movements as the bow was readied, and then the trajectory of the arrow as it made its way to the stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo noticeable characteristics of the attacker, something that would narrow it down?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHe or she was wearing black leather gloves. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it was a woman\u2019s hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wade took the arrow from me, spinning it between his fingers as he inspected it. I could feel Adam\u2019s pain, though I was sure he was putting on a brave face for the pack.</p><p>\u201cHow do we get the silver out of Adam\u2019s system?\u201d</p><p>Wade looked up, his face softening. \u201cIt depends how much got into his bloodstream. If it\u2019s not much, his metabolism will take care of it ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s a lot?\u201d I crossed my arms and dug my nails into my palms.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to call in a medicine man,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut if there was a lot in his veins, he\u2019d be in a lot more pain than he is now. I think we got lucky this time.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe that, but it was the \u2018this time\u2019 that made me realize how easily I could lose Adam.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me for anything else?\u201d I asked. \u201cI need to be with Adam.\u201d</p><p>Wade nodded and said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re done. I\u2019ll ask around and see if I can figure out why a vampire would be on your mountain and hopefully find out who hired them.\u201d</p> <p>When I left the office, I walked over to the log banister and looked down at the living room. Adam was still lying on the sofa, his eyes closed with an arm resting against his forehead. Maggie and Donald stood off to the side talking amongst themselves. As though Maggie knew I was observing them, she looked up and met my eyes. No words needed, I knew an accusation when I saw one.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>I woke up around five in the morning. To be honest, I hadn\u2019t slept more than an hour at a time. I kept tossing and turning, checking on Adam as he lay beside me. He was sound asleep all night, but I could feel his restlessness. His body was fighting off the silver coursing through his veins. Everyone thought he\u2019d be okay, but I still didn\u2019t like seeing him struggle through the blood poisoning.</p><p>I checked on him one last time before I crawled out of bed. The sheets were soaked as was his hair from sweating so much, but he was still sound asleep. Leaning over, I kissed his forehead and left the bedroom.</p><p>When I exited the hallway, I found Elle, Anthony, and Sawyer sitting around the kitchen table. Their heads all lifted at my entrance, though all of them, except for Anthony, kept their eyes anywhere but on mine. It took me a moment to realize that their strange behavior stemmed from me being their official alpha female now. The ceremony seemed like ages ago.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off,\u201d I said, heading over to the coffee pot.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elle asked.</p><p>Reaching for a mug, I looked over at the table again and their eyes lowered. I set the cup down a little harder than necessary, clearly annoyed. Cringing at the loudness, I lifted the carafe and poured the coffee.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201c... not meeting my eyes. I\u2019m still Anna, the newbie wolf.\u201d</p><p>I knew it was their wolf\u2019s way of showing me respect, but I\u2019d always thought it was a hokey attribute. It\u2019s odd trying to talk to someone when they won\u2019t look you in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a rarity, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I looked over to find Anthony watching me with interested curiosity. It still creeped me out that he looked so much like Adam. However, it was their vastly different personalities that made me not associate the two men. While Anthony never struck me himself while I\u2019d been kidnapped, he\u2019d watched as Eve abused me. I have a difficult time putting much stock in a person who can just standby while a misdeed is being committed.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I pulled out a barstool and spun around to face the table, hugging my coffee in my hands.</p><p>\u201cAlpha\u2019s relish their power,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cYou act almost embarrassed by it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Anna isn\u2019t a pureblood,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that as a criticism,\u201d he added. \u201cHad you been born a wolf, you\u2019d be as stuck up as the rest of them.\u201d He slid a sidelong glance at Anthony, but Anthony was still staring at me. The glint dancing in his eyes put me on edge.</p><p>Ignoring Sawyer\u2019s comment, Anthony said, \u201cAdam\u2019s a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, looking away. From what I understood, Anthony always wanted what Adam had. Had I become one of those things? Just thinking about it made my skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d I said, desperate to change the subject. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the agenda for today, Elle?\u201d</p><p>I caught Anthony\u2019s smirk out of my peripheral, but I ignored him. The thing was, I was going to have to talk to him in private sometime soon. I needed to not only figure out what he was really doing here, but also thank him for stopping Eve the day I was attacked. Had he not, I would be dead. Being in that kind of debt to someone like Anthony unnerved me. Still, I\u2019d give credit where it was due.</p><p>\u201cThe whole shindig begins,\u201d Elle said. \u201cAdam was gracious enough to call in caterers so I\u2019m free to enjoy the festivities instead of slaving in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Maybe we can get in some training this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Elle said. \u201cI have to help Joe and Asher judge the obstacle course.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cObstacle course?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWe\u2019re one camera short of being a dog show.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer laughed, choking on his coffee. Elle slapped him on the back so hard his torso flung forward and he had to place his hands on the table to steady himself.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Sawyer?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He held up a hand, coughing one last time before he said, \u201cFantastic.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIf Elle\u2019s busy, I\u2019ll train you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig surprise,\u201d Anthony mumbled not so quietly under his breath. Looking at me, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re an alpha now, Anna. If anyone were to notice a mutt training you, it would cement their judgment that you\u2019re not cut out for the position. There\u2019s already been one attempt on your life, do you really want more?\u201d</p><p>Did all the purebred wolves think I wasn\u2019t cut out for the position? One thing was for sure, if they found out I couldn\u2019t fight, they would be more inclined to challenge me. However, there was no way I was training with Anthony.</p><p>\u201cLet them think what they want,\u201d I said. \u201cSawyer, I\u2019d love to train with you.\u201d</p><p>A small pang still hit me in my stomach whenever I looked at Sawyer. He was gorgeous after all, but that wasn\u2019t enough to draw me away from Adam. A wrecking ball couldn\u2019t drive a wedge between us. While my wolf and I were in love with Adam, my wolf still remembered that night at the lake with Sawyer.</p><p>Sawyer began to stand, only to be stopped when Anthony stood up, too, placing a hand on his shoulder to stop him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your alpha now,\u201d he said to Sawyer. \u201cDo you want to be responsible for teaching her wrong maneuvers\u2014resulting in her death? Now, I don\u2019t know you very well, but I can smell your attraction to her, and I assume that means you wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to her, right?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer looked at me\u2014well, he looked at my stomach or shoulder, still not meeting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d I said. \u201cSawyer is an excellent fighter, and he\u2019s my pack ... you\u2019re not. Just because you waltz in here and pretend everything\u2019s peachy, doesn\u2019t mean it is.\u201d I paused to glare at him. I stood up and took my coffee to the sink, my stomach queasy all of a sudden. \u201cYou kidnapped me while your mate beat me,\u201d I said through tight lips. My fingers curled around the curve of the sink basin, and I looked over at the table. \u201cNo one wants you here, Anthony.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen was so quiet I was sure the slamming of my heart would wake up the entire house. Anthony and I held each other\u2019s eyes, neither one of us willing to look away first. I\u2019d be damned if he started dictating who I trained with and putting down my pack in the process. The tension amplified when Anthony walked around the table. Elle and Sawyer\u2019s bodies tightened, readying for a fight. I turned, squaring my shoulders to face Anthony. My wolf writhed inside of me, anxious for a fight. Her temper coursed through my veins like wildfire, giving me a rush of energy.</p><p>Anthony approached me, resting a hand on the counter. This close, I could see the differences between him and his brother. Anthony\u2019s eyes had more green than blue in them, and the jaded light shining behind them gave him an air or arrogance, whereas Adam\u2019s light was pure confidence.</p><p>Anthony leaned in so that whatever he had to say would remain between him and me. My body tensed, hating how close he was to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you, Anna,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd by the end of the week, you\u2019ll be happy about it.\u201d</p><p>A snort came out on its own accord. His words sounded important rather than intimate, as though he knew something, but wasn\u2019t saying.</p><p>\u201cYou know who tried killing me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He considered me for a moment and then said, \u201cMaybe ... maybe not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, looking around Anthony\u2019s large body to find Adam standing in the hallway. His hair was in disarray. Pieces stuck to his sweaty forehead, and his skin looked paler than normal, but his eyes were hard and staring at Anthony.</p><p>I moved around Anthony and went to Adam. \u201cWhat are you doing out of bed?\u201d It was a rhetorical question. I knew my anxiousness toward his brother woke him up. Adam gripped my hand, his eyes still on Anthony.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to speak to her,\u201d Adam said. \u201cMom and Dad may buy your bullshit, but I don\u2019t. If you want to bring me down, do so with me personally, and leave Anna out of it.\u201d</p><p>Anthony crossed his arms and leaned against the counter. The smirk on his face was as pompous as the glint in his eyes. The power that normally radiated off Adam was just a subtle buzz, though I knew he was pissed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you back to bed,\u201d I said, tugging him down the hall. I made a silent promise to myself that when I found the time, I would punch Anthony in the face for stressing Adam out when he needed to be relaxing.</p><p>Back in the bedroom, I helped Adam into bed and sat on the edge of the mattress. He brought my hand toward his mouth and pressed a soft kiss to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your brother, Adam. I can handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my parents, I would have kicked his ass off our mountain the moment he showed up.\u201d</p><p>I smiled to myself. Though Adam was a strong alpha, purebred wolves were taught to respect their parents. As much as he hated their decision to keep his brother around, Adam would not go against their wishes. I could find the humor in the situation\u2014a squabble between siblings\u2014even though I knew it was much more serious. I also knew that whatever the world threw at us, Adam and I would get through it. He lived for me, and I lived for him. Not even a sibling rivalry could taint that.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>I ran my fingernails up and down his bare chest in a soothing motion. I loved feeling the ripple of muscle beneath my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cHe said he was here for me, and that he might know who\u2019s targeting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Adam hissed through his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s either him, or he\u2019s lying. You\u2019re not leaving my side until he\u2019s gone.\u201d He began to sit up, and I pushed him back down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in no shape to be out of bed. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnna\u2014\u201d</p><p>I quieted him with a finger on his lips. Leaning down, I replaced my finger with my mouth. My wolf, along with my libido, roared to life. She would have to settle for a kiss, though; Adam wasn\u2019t ready for sex just yet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re to stay in bed, understand?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cI kinda like it when you boss me around.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a quick kiss. \u201cMe too,\u201d I said with a wink. \u201cDo you want anything for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Adam said suggestively. He reached an arm up and slipped his fingers through my hair, bringing my head down to meet his mouth. I allowed him to kiss me, opening my lips to welcome his tongue. Heat blossomed between my legs at the thought of him being inside of me again. I had to stomp the lust down, though. What little strength he had needed to be used to heal his body.</p> <p>\u201cEasy there, Casanova.\u201d I leaned back, resting a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll wrinkle the sheets when you\u2019re one hundred percent again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always ready for you, Chante.\u201d He gripped my wrist and placed it over the bulge struggling against his track pants. A delightful shiver skipped its way up my legs, settling in my center. The sheer lust I had for Adam often left me in a greedy haze. Under the right circumstances, I would have been naked already. Being responsible sucked sometimes.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I moaned. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t wait to feel it inside me when you\u2019re better.\u201d</p><p>Adam let out a heavy breath, releasing my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, woman, killing me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and stood up, walking over to my dresser. \u201cOne or two days isn\u2019t going to kill you. Stop being a drama king.\u201d I began to take off my pajamas so I could dress for the day. Adam\u2019s eyes seared a path along my body, heating me from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou\u2019re plan isn\u2019t to kill me. You want to torture me until I\u2019m mad with horniness. You\u2019re a tricky, tricky woman, Chante.\u201d</p><p>I sent him a coy smile over my shoulder before I bent over and tugged up my denim shorts. Adam\u2019s responsive groan was enough to make me smile wider.</p><p>Once I was dressed in shorts and a tank top, I walked back over to the bed and sat next to Adam.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d It was nice pretending things were normal, but the silver coursing through his body might as well have been coursing through mine. His discomfort was my own, and no brave face could fool me into believing he was handling this as well as he convinced the others. I\u2019d only ever seen Adam as the strong, confident alpha of our pack. Seeing him lying in my bed with a fresh sheen of sweat across his brow unsettled me in more ways than one. It reminded me how fragile life was, even for those of the paranormal persuasion. Lifting that veil and seeing the truth behind it scared me more than I\u2019d admit. One silver bullet to the heart, and any one of us could be wiped from this world. Adam had been close, too close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live,\u201d Adam said, giving confirmation to my unspoken question.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I was tense until I felt my body substantially relax. Adam had become something to me that no other man was able to achieve. I knew without a doubt I loved him, even if I hadn\u2019t spoken those three little words yet. Even with my certainty of feelings for the man before me, I still struggled to voice them. I credited it as my fear I\u2019d always had toward commitment, but if I was being honest, it was because the intensity of our relationship left me speechless. Saying, \u201cI love you\u201d didn\u2019t seem sufficient, though I didn\u2019t know any other words to convey what my heart was telling me every time I looked into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Adam said, reaching a hand up and gripping my chin to turn my face toward his. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small smile and shook my head. \u201cNothing,\u201d I lied. \u201cI\u2019m just relieved you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d That was the truth. \u201cIf something were to happen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Adam interrupted. \u201cThis is nothing.\u201d He signaled to his leg where the wound hid beneath his pants. \u201cAs long as I have you, I have something to live for. Not even a vat of silver will keep me from clawing my way from death to stay beside you, Chante. We\u2019re infinite.\u201d</p><p>My lips curled inward, and I bit down on my upper one to keep from smiling like a fool. My eyes blurred with tears from the sincere words he so easily spoke. Where I found trouble voicing my feelings, Adam laid them bare.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Adam said, bringing me out of my thoughts. \u201cThe ceremony was disrupted before I pledged myself to you. I had a surprised all planned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMhmm,\u201d Adam hummed. \u201cTonight, we\u2019ll complete the ceremony, low key. I\u2019ll invite the wolves here and finish what we started.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou\u2019re still healing and the conference starts today. It\u2019s going to be chaotic. I just want you focusing on getting better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, you\u2019re all I\u2019ve focused on since you came to live here. And this cannot wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said bewildered. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it tonight then.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled\u2014pleased he got his way. \u201cNow, get out of here. I should be resting, and you\u2019re making it very hard to concentrate on anything but those tiny ass shorts you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and shook my head at him. When I began to stand, he gripped my arm and pulled me back down.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to leave when you won\u2019t let me?\u201d</p><p>A playful glint shone behind his sapphire eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think you were going to leave without so much as a goodbye kiss, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ... I wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect your throat at all costs,\u201d Sawyer said, and I nodded. \u201cFighting is all about instinct. You really don\u2019t have to worry about much. You held your own against Eve. Had Adam not pulled her off you, you might have been able to finish her yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pissed then.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer smiled. The sun glinted off his dirty blond hair and bronze chest. Memories of our one night together flitted through my mind. It should have been awkward, but it wasn\u2019t. I knew he still had feelings for me, but he also knew he had to move on. Most people wouldn\u2019t be able to remain friends after an ordeal like that. I was happy that we were both mature enough to see past it. Sawyer was a part of my pack and I his; the bond that goes with that is stronger than petty jealousy.</p><p>\u201cPissed off is good,\u201d Sawyer commented. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a fight for real, those emotions will help, but they can also hinder. Don\u2019t allow your anger to override your common sense.\u201d He unbuttoned his jeans and let them slip down his strong legs. I began to shimmy out of my shorts and tugged my tank top over my head. I ignored Sawyer\u2019s heavy gaze. If Adam knew I was standing in my underwear in front of him, I\u2019d get chewed out. Not because he didn\u2019t trust me or because I was almost nude, but because he knew how Sawyer felt. His anger would come from the hungriness reflecting from Sawyer\u2019s eyes. Coveting one\u2019s mate was a dangerous line to toe, especially an alpha\u2019s mate. I just prayed he had enough sense not to cross it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do if your hind legs are attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick out?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s head bobbed up and down. \u201cWith any luck, you\u2019ll land a blow to the eyes, and the attacker will release you. Just listen to your wolf and allow her to act solely.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and Sawyer fell to his knees. I did the same, happy for the ten feet or so separating us. While I liked Sawyer, the blatant desire he refused to hide made me uncomfortable and guilty. I knew it was illogical to feel guilt, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Had I known that Adam and I would bond, I never would have gotten involved with Sawyer. What\u2019s done is done, though, and moving forward is the only way to get past it.</p><p>I closed my eyes and called my wolf forward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pin you,\u201d Sawyer said, and I cracked an eyelid open. \u201cI want you to break my hold by any means necessary, got it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and closed my eyes again, concentrating on the beast lying in wait just beneath the surface of my skin. Her power caused my skin to tingle, and a rush of energy to burst through my veins. It was such a commanding high that I would never get used to. A shot of adrenaline raced its way through my body, and then I was on four paws instead of my hands and knees. My wolf relished being released. She hadn\u2019t gotten the chance a lot in the past week. We hadn\u2019t done our nightly runs like before, because my nights were often occupied\u2014twined around Adam\u2019s body. She liked that just as much, though, I knew she loved to be in nature\u2014running and hunting, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There is no realistic way to explain what it is like to transform into an animal. She holds influence over me, a constant dominant voice in the back of my head. I trust her instincts as much as she trusts mine. When she\u2019s at the forefront, I\u2019m tucked firmly in the back of her mind, aware of everything that\u2019s going on.</p><p>We watched Sawyer transform. His wolf\u2019s fur was the color of silver with sprinklings of black and white. My wolf\u2019s eyes flicked to the rustle of branches, as a breeze blew through the valley. There was a crispness in the air that hadn\u2019t been there before, a sure sign of an early winter in the mountains.</p><p>Sawyer\u2019s wolf rushed me. My wolf stepped back just in time to miss his sharp teeth. We circled around one another. The playful glint in Sawyer\u2019s golden eyes was full of mischief. I lunged forward and tackled him, sinking my teeth into the scruff of his neck. My teeth had a firm hold, but I made sure to gauge the pressure so as to not puncture the skin. Sawyer thrashed, and my grip broke. I stumbled to the side, trying to find my feet when he attacked. He leaped onto my back, sending both of us crashing to the ground. I used the momentum to roll so that I was the one on top, and I struck.</p> <p>\u201cDo you yield?\u201d I sent the message to Sawyer\u2019s mind, my jaws wrapped around his jugular. His wolf lay limp beneath me, giving in to his alpha female.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sawyer replied.</p><p>I released my grip and took a step away when he bounced up and pounced. He gripped my tail between his teeth, and my wolf whelped in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou yielded,\u201d I said accusingly.</p><p>\u201cRule number one: never let your guard down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d</p><p>I positioned my weight on my front paws and kicked out with my back legs. Sawyer\u2019s grip didn\u2019t lessen. I bent my body and tried to sink my sharp teeth into any part of him, but the angle was all wrong and I was left snapping at open air.</p><p>I was struggling so much that when he let me go, I stumbled forward and nose-dived into the ground. My wolf was not a happy camper. She let out a low growl and whirled around ready to tear Sawyer apart for the humiliation.</p><p>Loud masculine bellows of laughter halted her attack. Sawyer had changed back and was lying on the barren ground, his back to the earth and his hands resting on his taut stomach while he stared up at the sky.</p><p>He looked over at me and burst out laughing again. Through my wolf, I could feel her confusion at his merriment. A rush of tingles washed through my body as I tucked her away and changed back. I stood with my hands on my hips and stared down at Sawyer. I smiled despite his prank.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to treat your alpha female?\u201d I teased.</p> <p>Sawyer looked over at me, and his laughter stopped. His lips parted, and his eyes grew hungry as they raked over my nude body. Their path left a shiver in their wake.</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d I said in a serious tone. I cared about Sawyer as a friend, and if Adam ever saw the look he was giving me now, he\u2019d be dead before the sun could set.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever think about it?\u201d</p><p>I bent and picked up my clothes. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur one night,\u201d Sawyer said, standing. He made no move to retrieve his clothes. I kept my body angled toward him so that my shoulder was to him, and I kept my attention on my clothes. I worked my shirt so that it wasn\u2019t inside out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a double edged sword,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I tell you no, it\u2019ll hurt your feelings. And if I say yes, it\u2019ll look as though I\u2019m not loyal to Adam, which I am.\u201d I met his eyes with that last statement. Whatever nonsense was going on in Sawyer\u2019s head, he needed to know that nothing would ever happen between us again.</p><p>\u201cSo which is it?\u201d</p><p>I slipped on my shirt and shimmied quickly into my shorts. My bra and underwear were ruined from the change. I picked the scraps of material up and stuffed them in my pocket as best as I could.</p> <p>I took a deep breath as I turned to face Sawyer. Right at that moment, he bent down\u2014ass facing me\u2014and picked up his clothes. My eyes fell to the ground so quickly, my vision blurred for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCan we not have this discussion again, please?\u201d</p><p>Sawyer stood, fumbling with his clothes. \u201cI think about it,\u201d he said quietly, almost as though he was talking to himself rather than me. \u201cI can\u2019t look at you without remembering that night.\u201d His head lifted, and his eyes met mine. They were full of heat, but also something else, something sadder. The pain hiding behind those beautiful green eyes made my gut twist in guilt. In a different world, I could see myself very happy with Sawyer. However, there was no point in entertaining a \u2018what-if\u2019 scenario.</p><p>\u201cSawyer, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize for you and Adam. I don\u2019t like it, but I understand. It just ... sucks. I\u2019m not purposely trying to make things harder on you, Anna.\u201d He slipped on his jeans. I watched as his fingers slipped the bronze button through the hole and then went to the zipper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working through things and sometimes the shit slips out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that you\u2019re happy.\u201d He paused and locked eyes with me. \u201cI just wish it was with me.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I do, too. I didn\u2019t say it. There was no point in giving him false hope. I just knew that things would be easier with Sawyer. His life wouldn\u2019t rest in my hands like Adam\u2019s did. As much as I loved Adam, our relationship was more complex than anything I was used to. Adam was in a league all by himself compared to the men I had dated in the past. While I could entertain the idea of a simpler life with Sawyer, I knew even if I could change things and not be bonded to Adam, I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d take our complex relationship over an easy one any day of the week.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Portable bleachers had been brought in for the festivities. Rows of them sat on either side of the open space like a makeshift football field. After sleeping most of the day, Adam was starting to feel better. I huddled next to him, wrapping my arms around his waist and leaning my head against his shoulder. I knew his body was still recovering, and my closeness would keep him warm. The weather in the mountains is fickle at best. It could be sunny and ninety degrees in the plains while a snowstorm brewed at the highest peaks.</p><p>Adam turned his head, and I looked up at him, smiling. He still stunned me every time we made eye contact. He was mouthwatering in so many ways. His blond hair hung over his sparkling azure eyes. I watched as his full lips stretched into a grin that had my panties wanting to drop.</p><p>\u201cAdam, dear.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, the spell was broken. I sat up and tried not to frown at Maggie\u2019s intrusion. Her lips steeled into a line when she looked at me. Today, she wore a gray pantsuit with a pale pink undershirt. Her blond hair was upswept and professional, just like her outfit.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Maggie removed her icy gaze from me. Her eyes softened when she looked upon her son. She reached a hand out and rested it against the side of Adam\u2019s face, concern filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThe amount of silver must not have been as great as Sunny anticipated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s excellent news, and I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re on the mend.\u201d She smiled, but her eyes cut to my face. \u201cIt helps you\u2019re from a strong bloodline.\u201d</p><p>The glance was brief, but I knew what she was saying\u2014that I wasn\u2019t worthy of someone of his stature. That\u2019s the great thing about the heart, though; it doesn\u2019t care about labels, race, creed, or social standings. The heart is blind to the nonsensical bullshit that weighs down societies.</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken with Chloe today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stopped by to check on me, but I was asleep is what I\u2019m told,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to thank her for her concern.\u201d</p><p>I looked between Adam and his mother. A glint reflected in her conniving eyes when she glanced at me. So Chloe was the girl she wanted her son to be with? I wondered if that had to do with Chloe\u2019s pure bloodline, or the connections it would ensure for Adam\u2019s parents. I learned early on after joining the Everwood pack that emotion does not play into the pairing of two wolves. It\u2019s all very political and depressing. Aside from Adam and I, there were only three other couples in our pack. Most had casual hookups, but none of them considered settling down unless it benefited their position.</p><p>I was determined not to allow the jealousy of Chloe show itself\u2014that\u2019s what Maggie wanted.</p><p>\u201cThat was very nice of her,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to thank her, as well.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s hand gripped mine tighter, and he gave me a secret smile that told me he wasn\u2019t fooled by my faux politeness.</p><p>\u201cYes, well ...\u201d Maggie turned. \u201cOh, here she comes.\u201d</p><p>Boy, did she ever. Dressed in a short sundress that barely covered her behind and neck-breaking heels that elongated her already long legs. Her blonde hair was pinned up to expose the length of her slim neck and shoulders. The jealousy I\u2019d been containing burst forward, and all I saw was red. My wolf scratched and clawed at the smile she cast in our mate\u2019s direction.</p><p>Back off, bitch!</p><p>\u201cHi, guys,\u201d Chloe said with a saccharine smile.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smiled back, making sure to keep my lips pressed tight so it didn\u2019t come out as a sneer.</p><p>She sat beside Adam, a little too close. Adam looked down at our joined hands, and I followed his direction. My fingers were white from the pressure. Smiling sheepishly, I released my grip a little. I hated feeling like this\u2014hated the insecurity Chloe brought out in me. The problem was, Adam was mated to Eve when our thing began. Though I refused to be the other woman, I wasn\u2019t so sure Chloe would. I knew deep down that wasn\u2019t the type of man Adam was, but the small uncertainty still birthed itself inside of me. Adam\u2019s and my case was different, wasn\u2019t it? We were pulled toward each other because we were each other\u2019s Chantes.</p><p>He was the yin to my yang.</p><p>The cheese to my macaroni.</p><p>The jelly to my peanut butter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So why was I deluding myself with doubts that he liked what he saw when he looked at Chloe? His eyes weren\u2019t even on her; they were on me. Take that, Momma Everwood.</p><p>\u201cAnna, may I speak with you in private for a moment?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, retreating from my thoughts. Maggie stared at me expectantly. Having another one-on-one conversation with that woman was not on my immediate to-do list, but I didn\u2019t want animosity with the mother of the man I loved. I would do everything in my power to be civil toward her, and if we didn\u2019t get along, the blame would rest solely on her shoulders.</p> <p>I stood and told Adam I would be back. I even smiled at Chloe. Adam still held my hand and tugged me back before I could leave. His hands came up to cup my face, and he stared into my eyes for a moment before he brought his lips to mine. I kissed him slow and methodically, making him feel the pressure each brush of my lips brought.</p><p>\u201cOh, for Heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d Maggie said behind me. \u201cRespectable alphas do not make-out in public, Adam.\u201d</p><p>I broke the kiss, annoyed with Maggie for her second interruption of the day. Smiling against Adam\u2019s mouth, I gave him one quick kiss and turned to talk with the she-devil.</p><p>Maggie walked off without another word, and I followed, ready to get this over with so I could watch the games. She stopped at the side of the house, just far enough back that we were blocked from viewers. When she looked up at me, I could see the determination in her eyes. I already knew what she wanted to talk to me about.</p><p>\u201cHow many more times are you going to put Adam\u2019s life in danger?\u201d</p> <p>My eyes widened. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware I put his life in danger before the shooting.\u201d</p><p>Maggie crossed her thin arms across her chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve put his life in danger since the very beginning.\u201d She rested one arm on the other, bent at the elbow, and held up a finger. \u201cThe first time was seducing him from Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha ... I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Maggie shook her head and continued, \u201cThe pairing of two clans is a very important business deal, Anna. You pranced in here and tempted my son into thinking he should be with you. It\u2019s a miracle Eve\u2019s father hasn\u2019t declared war on us for our betrayal.\u201d</p><p>Pranced? She made it sound like I was some floozy with the I.Q. of a toddler.</p><p>\u201cSecond,\u201d Maggie said, holding up another finger. \u201cYou brainwashed Adam into going against our Leaders.\u201d At my confused expression, she asked, \u201cWas he not prepared to fight them for your freedom?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, my mouth agape. \u201cYeah ... but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up another finger. \u201cWere you not the reason why a fight broke out here, and Eve was killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spinning things out of context,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, Anthony and Eve kidnapped me, but it was because they\u2019re psychopaths. Eve was killing humans, risking our secret. Adam rescued me, and that started the fight, but it wasn\u2019t all for me. It was to put an end to Eve\u2019s murdering. I would think as an olde blood you wouldn\u2019t want the first impression of wolves leaked to the public to be that we\u2019re bloodthirsty monsters, and that\u2019s exactly what they would have thought had Adam not taken care of the problem. Eve wasn\u2019t tactful in her killings. She would have been discovered sooner or later.\u201d I took a shuddering breath, worked up from the anger Maggie caused.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d At her nod, I continued, \u201cWhy is it that you see fault in me, a person you don\u2019t even know, yet you\u2019re treating Anthony as though he\u2019s a saint? He was part of Eve\u2019s crazy plan and sleeping with her, I might add. You look down your nose at me for my bloodline, but you\u2019re blind to all the faults of those with what you consider pure blood.\u201d I paused and met her eyes glare for glare. \u201cI may not have Eve\u2019s social standing, but I would never treat your son the way she did. Politics play no role in a relationship. I love your son and the Great Spirits have brought us together as each other\u2019s Chantes. Not even you, Maggie Everwood, can undo that.\u201d</p><p>We studied each other for a few lingering moments. I\u2019d said my peace, and I was done. There was nothing else to say that would convince her of my worth. This was another odd thing about my relationship with Adam. I\u2019d never met a boyfriend\u2019s parents before. I had never had a boyfriend long enough to reach that step.</p><p>\u201cI believe you love him,\u201d Maggie said softly, \u201cbut he\u2019s my son, and the love of a mother will never be outdone by a girlfriend. I also love Anthony and see him for who he is, not who he shows the world. I will do everything in my power to protect both of them.\u201d She took a step toward me, and I stiffened. My wolf bristled beneath my skin, ready to come to the surface, if needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m about to do something I have never done,\u201d Maggie said. She took a deep breath, readying herself for what she was about to say. \u201cI beg you, walk away from Adam. Put his needs before yours and leave him. He will never stop placing himself in harm\u2019s way while you are in the picture.\u201d Her eyes changed from conniving to compassionate. \u201cLove is a selfless emotion, Anna. Put aside your personal feelings and think about what it would mean for Adam if you left.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond, but Maggie held up a hand to stop me.</p> <p>\u201cThink about it,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because we got lucky this time, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll get a second chance. The next attack could be his last. Will you be able to get over the regret his death would cause?\u201d She took another step closer and reached out to me, placing her hands on either side of my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIf the answer is yes, then you do not truly love him. If the answer is no, then do something to prevent it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give me another chance to speak. With one last look, she walked past me. I spun around and watched her move toward the bleachers. A lot of people walked back and forth, either heading to watch the games or taking advantage of the huge buffet we had catered. Through the gaps of the crowd, I could see Adam sitting on the bleachers. Chloe laughed at something, and Adam kept his gaze on the obstacle course in front of him.</p><p>It struck me then that maybe the reason the purebloods arranged mates was for the protection it offered them from the Chante myth, rather than getting a leg up in their rankings. By pairing two people who did not love each other, there was no risk of them bonding. What Adam and I thought was a testament to our love could also be construed as a curse\u2014a weakness.</p><p>Adam looked over, his eyes searching for me. When he found me, we locked gazes and a pain shot through my chest. Could I really just walk away from him? He stood up\u2014ready to come over when I shook my head. I tried for a smile, but it probably looked as fake as it felt.</p><p>I looked away, unable to hold his eyes and think what I was thinking. The idea of leaving him caused an unfathomable amount of guilt. I knew he wouldn\u2019t understand. Hell, I didn\u2019t understand why I was even considering it.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been looking for you.\u201d</p><p>I looked up from the ground. Elle stood with her hands on her hips. Today, she had her long copper hair braided. A few wisps escaped and played against her neck.</p><p>I swallowed around the discomfort Maggie had caused. \u201cWhat\u2019d you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, of course,\u201d Elle said with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve been M.I.A., and everyone is anxious to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I noticed she still didn\u2019t look me in the eye. \u201cYeah, I trained this morning and just had a ... chat with Adam\u2019s mom.\u201d I ran my fingers through my hair. \u201cEveryone probably thinks I\u2019m stuck up, huh? I promise I\u2019m not trying to ignore them.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward and looped her arm through mine, tugging me forward. I laughed when I stumbled over a stick. Elle made it easy to forget all of my troubles, even if they\u2019d be waiting for me tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cThis is the infamous Anna Avery,\u201d Elle said, holding her hands out in her best Vanna White impression.</p><p>I was standing in the middle of a medium-sized crowd, all eyes on me. I smiled nervously and held up my hand in a small wave. Being on display wasn\u2019t as fun as it sounded.</p><p>\u201cAnna, it\u2019s such a pleasure to meet you,\u201d a young man said. \u201cMy name\u2019s Leif. I\u2019m the brother of Sage.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a minute and then briefly remembered meeting Sage back at the house. Now that he mentioned it, I could see the resemblance. Where Sage had long hair like an oil slick, Leif\u2019s hair was cut short. Both siblings were of Native American descent and absolutely beautiful. Leif\u2019s big brown eyes smiled back at me, and a dimple dented his cheek when he grinned. I\u2019d guess he was in his teens. Once he got older, the ladies would be banging down his door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you too, Leif.\u201d That caused him to smile wider.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Jill,\u201d Elle said, pointing to the enthusiastic woman I\u2019d met the other day. I smiled, but made sure not to engage her. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to discuss my relationship with Adam.</p><p>Elle rambled off names, pointing to faces as she did. I nodded and smiled politely, all the while wanting to just blend in with the crowd. I didn\u2019t see what the fuss was about. So, I was a mutt who\u2019d bonded with an alpha. Was that so gossip worthy?</p><p>Elle nudged me in the ribs. I scowled at her, and she widened her eyes for me to pay attention. Apparently someone was talking to me, and I hadn\u2019t noticed. I looked up to find the face of a very handsome man. My wolf perked up and took notice, too.</p><p>\u201cThe ceremony was beautiful,\u201d the man was saying. \u201cYou were beautiful. It\u2019s such a shame it was ruined. I was very much looking forward to Adam pledging himself to you.\u201d The man winked, and a slight tremor ran through my legs. His eyes were the color of arctic ice, though there was nothing cold about the way he was looking at me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, this is Ben Jenkins,\u201d Elle said.</p><p>Ben Jenkins. Why did that name sound familiar?</p><p>\u201cAlpha of the Idaho pack,\u201d Ben supplied and held out his hand.</p><p>I had an ah-ha moment, the name clicking in my brain. So this was the man the Leaders planned to send me to just a couple weeks ago when they accused me of Eve\u2019s murders. I reached out and shook his hand, and my body instantly grew hot. My stomach clenched, and my breasts strained against the cotton of my tank top. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell? I dropped his hand and took a step back. Maybe he had a seductive power like Nicholas and was forcing his influence onto me.</p><p>Ben smirked, holding my eyes. \u201cI hear you almost became a member of my pack.\u201d His eyes raked up the length of my body before they connected with mine again. \u201cI would have loved to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen Jenkins,\u201d a deep voice said behind me, and I visibly relaxed. Adam moved past me so that his body shielded mine. \u201cI heard you wouldn\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d</p> <p>I moved so I could see what was going on. Adam\u2019s possessiveness could get a little overbearing at times.</p><p>\u201cI rearranged some things,\u201d Ben said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t miss the opportunity to meet the woman who captured Adam Everwood, the notorious womanizer.\u201d</p><p>Womanizer? Adam?</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago, Ben, and none of them had what Anna does.\u201d</p><p>Nice save, playboy.</p> <p>Ben rubbed his chin and shook his head back and forth as though thinking about something. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and Chloe looked pretty cozy earlier.\u201d</p><p>Red. I saw nothing but red, or maybe it was green?</p><p>Adam snorted in disgust. \u201cI see you\u2019re still up to your old ways, causing trouble for entertainment. It\u2019s not going to work this time. You see this?\u201d Adam held his hand up, branded palm facing Ben. \u201cNothing you say will disprove what this woman means to me.\u201d</p><p>Adam lowered his hand and grabbed mine. \u201cCome on, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting all of you,\u201d I said to the group. They nodded and smiled, turning their attention back to the wolfy games.</p><p>Adam and I walked to the sidelines, far enough away from Ben, and stopped. Whoever built the obstacle course had done a great job. There was a climbing wall, something that looked like monkey bars, and a lot of other things built to test their endurance.</p> <p>Adam stood behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist. Leaning down, he rested his chin on my shoulder. I inhaled his scent, closing my eyes as I allowed it to comfort me.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d I said. \u201cYou were a ladies man, huh?\u201d I tried to sound nonchalant, but the thought of Adam with another woman made me almost nauseous. I wasn\u2019t a fool; I knew he had been with other women, and it was silly to get upset over it, but when it came to Adam, I was sometimes irrational.</p><p>\u201cThat was before I was an alpha of my own pack,\u201d Adam said, kissing the side of my neck. \u201cEvery teenage wolf goes through a period like that.\u201d</p><p>I was silent as I thought about what it would have been like to see Adam in his teen years. Did werewolves go to normal schools? There was still so much I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous, Chante?\u201d Adam wiggled his fingers against my stomach, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>Adam tickled me again. \u201cNot until you tell me you understand that there is no other woman for me.\u201d</p><p>I doubled over, held in place by Adam\u2019s strong arms. I was laughing so hard people were starting to stare.</p> <p>\u201cO ... okay,\u201d I said through a giggle.</p><p>\u201cOkay what?\u201d He eased up his torture.</p><p>\u201cI understand that I\u2019m the only woman for you,\u201d I said over my shoulder. \u201cThough Chloe is trying her damnedest to change that.\u201d</p><p>Adam turned me around and cupped my face. He stared into my eyes, a sad smile on his face. \u201cIt bothers me that you don\u2019t trust me, Anna. I don\u2019t know what I can do to prove to you that you are the only woman I desire.\u201d He leaned down and brushed his lips against mine. \u201cYour body is the only one I want to kiss.\u201d He pressed a kiss to my lips again. \u201cTo taste.\u201d He pinned me with his eyes. \u201cTo make love to. Understand?\u201d</p><p>I was breathless and on fire for him. I nodded, my lips parted. Reaching up, I ran my hands across the span of his broad shoulders and lifted myself up on my tiptoes to reach his mouth. Adam entrapped my body in his arms, yanking me against his hard body. A moan slipped out when his tongue slipped between my lips. The hardness of his erection pressed against his jeans and stoked the fire raging between my legs.</p><p>Then everything disappeared.</p><p>I was no longer in Adam\u2019s arms or standing in the field by our house. I was in a meadow, surrounded by tall pine trees, and Adam was lying in a pool of blood at my feet. I fell to my knees, a scream ripping from my throat. I grasped for Adam, my fingers curling into his shirt as I fell upon him. Blood seeped through his shirt, turning white to red. His head lolled to the side, his blue eyes wide and full of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I whispered, my lips trembling. \u201cAdam!\u201d I screamed, clutching onto his shoulders. I shook him, guiding his face to mine so I could look into those fading eyes. It was either raining, or I was crying\u2014I couldn\u2019t be sure. All I could focus on was Adam.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d I pleaded, leaning down and resting my forehead against his. I leaned back and kissed his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. Just hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChante,\u201d he whispered, and then his eyes fell shut.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d I shook his shoulders frantically. \u201cAdam.\u201d</p><p>I came back to the now, my eyes now focusing on the obstacle course.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll do that tomorrow,\u201d Adam was saying. I must have missed the other part of the conversation. My vision must not have been long enough for him to notice. I whipped around in his arms and hugged him tight, squeezing his neck.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Adam soothed, his hands rubbing my back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Anna? You\u2019re shaking.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back and cupped his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was horrible, Adam. I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Was it a vision?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, though I couldn\u2019t put to words what I\u2019d seen. I couldn\u2019t voice that nightmare. I kept seeing the blood and the light fading from those beautiful blue eyes. Tears continued to stream down my face.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Wade.\u201d I began to walk away when Adam gripped my arm to stop me.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you saw.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and wiped a hand across my cheeks to erase the tears. When I met Adam\u2019s eyes, another round of fresh tears dampened my face.</p><p>\u201cYour death.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>I found Wade around the back of house with Chelsea. They both looked up when Adam and I approached. Adam wouldn\u2019t let me talk to Wade alone. I couldn\u2019t blame him; the vision affected him more than anyone.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d I told Wade.</p><p>\u201cCan it wait?\u201d Wade slid a sidelong glance toward Chelsea. I understood he liked her, and she probably liked him, but now was not the time to lay the groundwork for a relationship when there was something wonky going on with my visions.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said sternly.</p><p>Wade leaned back in his chair, his arm draped over the back of Chelsea\u2019s. My visions weren\u2019t a secret so I didn\u2019t mind discussing them in front of her, but I also didn\u2019t know whom I could trust. Chelsea and I might have been friends in high school, but she hadn\u2019t been shy in letting me know she blamed me for her change. I didn\u2019t expect her to come to terms with it this soon. I sure as hell didn\u2019t.</p><p>I sat at the table, and Adam took the chair beside me. I explained the vision, making sure not to look at Adam. I could feel his unease through our bond. I couldn\u2019t imagine the look on his face. Once I was done explaining, I stared at Wade expectantly.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not much to go off of,\u201d Wade said. \u201cDid you see how he died? Who attacked him?\u201d</p><p>I thought for a second. \u201cNo, just what I told you. You said a seer saw the past, not the future. Why am I all of a sudden seeing it?\u201d</p><p>Wade sat up and tilted his head. He ran a hand over his buzzed head and then rested his fisted hands under his chin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still a new werewolf, Anna. Our gifts are not set in stone; they\u2019re constantly changing and developing. The good news is, now that you saw it, we can do something to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I pounded my fist against the wood table. I couldn\u2019t get the look of Adam\u2019s dying eyes out of my mind, and it had me on edge. I could not stand by and wait while someone was out there scheming to kill my mate.</p><p>I stood up and paced the deck, enraged and frightened at the same time. I felt strong hands come around my shoulders. Adam\u2019s fingers squeezed, and then I felt his hot breath against my neck.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t happened yet, which means we can do something to make sure it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked, turning to face him. \u201cHow am I supposed to figure out who wants to kill you when I didn\u2019t see that part? There are over two hundred wolves here, Adam. Any one of them could be responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say you start living up to your name, alpha,\u201d Wade said. When Adam and I looked at him, he explained, \u201cYou\u2019re a made wolf and the new alpha female of one of most prestigious packs. You may not have noticed yet, but a lot of wolves here are curious to meet you. A pureblood has never took a mutt\u2014no offense\u2014as their mate. Add to the fact that you guys bonded.\u201d</p><p>I flicked my eyes to Chelsea\u2019s face. Wade\u2019s comment about purebreds not mating with mutts didn\u2019t go unnoticed by her. Her pink lips turned down, and she kept her gaze on the table instead of Wade. I slid my eyes to Wade and motioned toward Chelsea. When he looked over, he realized what\u2019d he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cBut not because purebreds don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, they sleep with non-purebreds all the time ...\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and Chelsea stood. I\u2019d never seen anyone put their foot into their mouth as much as I did. Wade was doing a pretty good job of it.</p><p>\u201cI have some chores to do,\u201d Chelsea said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you guys are only good for sex. I just meant politics always get in the way.\u201d</p><p>Chelsea shook her head, bouncing brown curls around her head. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>Wade stood, but she was already opening the sliding glass door and heading inside. He let out a defeated sigh, sitting back down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow it\u2019s not such a mystery as to why I\u2019m single, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth, you are not,\u201d I said in agreement.</p><p>\u201cSo, getting back on track,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou want Anna to walk around and meet the visiting wolves in hopes of what, getting another vision?\u201d</p> <p>Wade stared at the door Chelsea had disappeared through for a second before bringing his attention back to us. I\u2019d make sure to smooth things over with Chelsea. I\u2019d be helping Wade out, and it\u2019d give me a chance to connect with her again. I hated how awkward things were between us.</p><p>\u201cAnna\u2019s power is linked through touch,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAll she has to do is go around and shake people\u2019s hands. Maybe she\u2019ll get something that will give us a lead.\u201d</p><p>I imagined walking around shaking two hundred hands, and I instantly felt like a slimy politician, smiling on the outside all the while scheming on the inside. If it helped saved Adam\u2019s life, though, I\u2019d do anything.</p><p>\u201cDo you think ...\u201d I began, exchanging a glance with Adam. \u201cDo you think someone wants to kill you because they know I weaken you?\u201d I kept my eyes anywhere but on Adam\u2019s face. Maggie\u2019s earlier pleads resounded in my head. As much as I hated to admit it, there was more truth to her words than I wanted to acknowledge. What if I was the reason for the horrid vision I\u2019d had?</p><p>Adam gripped my face and forced me to look at him. \u201cAnna, there will always be a power hungry wolf ready to take over what is not his. It\u2019s our nature to want to grow our packs for the stability it offers. You do not weaken me, understand?\u201d He paused and waited for me to nod. I didn\u2019t. He just didn\u2019t want to believe that I did and was hoping to convince me. Pressure weighed on my chest from the responsibility of our relationship. I\u2019d never been good with responsibility. I\u2019d quit more jobs than I could count because of it. My entire life I\u2019d been searching for something, anything that would make sense. Now that I\u2019d found it, it was on the verge of slipping through my fingers.</p> <p>\u201cAnna, tell me you know that. Don\u2019t let our enemies trick you into thinking otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we talk about this later?\u201d I glanced at Wade, uncomfortable having such a personal discussion in front of him.</p><p>Adam dropped his hands and took a step back. \u201cYeah, later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d Wade said, standing. \u201cYou should start socializing as soon as possible and if you feel or see anything, let us know right away.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d spent the entire day introducing myself to any wolf I laid eyes on. At one point, I introduced myself to one of my own pack mates. Needless to say, I did not have one vision. By the time the sun started descending, I was beyond frustrated. I viewed our visitors as potential enemies, studying them like criminals in a lineup. If someone approached Adam, I was right there by his side. If someone even mentioned his name, I was butting into his or her conversation to figure out why. I ignored the odd looks and hushed whispers. As long as Adam was safe, I couldn\u2019t give a fuck what our guests thought about me. The vision of Adam dying plagued me all day. It drove me to find the person responsible.</p><p>I was heading over to another group of wolves when someone\u2019s fingers curled around my forearm. Whirling around, a growl vibrated up my throat. I blinked, noticing Elle was my captor. Taking a ragged breath, my shoulders slumped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, wild woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, though my eyes were searching the surrounding crowds. My gaze traveled to the nearby tree line in search for any movement that would alert me to a coming attack.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d Elle shook my shoulders, snapping my attention back to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>She let go and took a step back, holding her hands up in surrender. Guilt instantly consumed me.</p><p>\u201cShit, Elle, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just ... I\u2019m flippin\u2019 the fuck out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said with a small smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I proceeded to tell her about the vision and what I was doing. By the end, Elle frowned and searched the crowds with her eyes, too.</p> <p>\u201cSee why I\u2019m freaking out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s ...\u201d She shook her head, letting the sentence trail off. \u201cBut, it doesn\u2019t mean it will happen, right?\u201d At my confused look, she continued, \u201cVisions aren\u2019t set in stone. It\u2019s a possibility, but the future is constantly changing, which means it might not happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way it won\u2019t happen, is if I find the person responsible and stop it. Any one of these people could be the one who kills Adam, and I can\u2019t make any visions appear. I have been walking around all day touching and talking to people and nothing. How am I supposed to stop it if my power only works every so often? If he dies and there was something I could do to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Elle said, gripping my hand. \u201cWorking yourself up isn\u2019t going to help anyone. You need to take a couple deep breaths and calm down. We\u2019ll figure this out, and you forget one very important thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam is one of the few undefeated wolves around. He\u2019s dealt with men trying to take his position, and none of them are here to try again. I know you\u2019re protective of him, but he\u2019s pretty bad ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t that bad ass at the ceremony when he was shot with a silver tipped arrow. I had the vision for a reason, Elle. He can\u2019t protect himself if he doesn\u2019t see the attack coming.\u201d</p><p>Elle released my hand and shook her head. I knew I was being bitchy but the fate of your mate can do that to a woman.</p><p>\u201cBeing negative about it isn\u2019t going to help is all I was saying.\u201d</p><p>Elle and I had hit it off from the start. We never fought, and she\u2019d always been there for me, but in that moment I was beyond frustrated with her. I admit, I was a little crazed and not thinking clearly. After being haunted by the vision all day, I figured I was entitled to freak out. Silver linings are great, but I wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to look for one.</p><p>\u201cAnd telling me not to worry about it isn\u2019t going to help either.\u201d</p><p>Elle snorted. \u201cWhatever. Deal with it however you want, my alpha. I just came out here to tell you Adam asked to see you. He\u2019s waiting in the house.\u201d She turned and walked away. I stared at her back, the anger dissipating and leaving me feeling like shit.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The house was completely dark and empty when I entered it. Candles on tall pedestals made a path toward the kitchen. Confused, I followed it, only to find it led down the hallway and to my bedroom. My frustrations slipped away, and a smile slipped onto my face. I never pegged Adam as the type for big romantic gestures, and it had me curious.</p><p>I hesitated outside my room for a moment before I opened the door. Adam stood just inside, wearing dark jeans and a button down white shirt that he\u2019d tucked in. The first couple buttons were undone, and I could see the hint of muscles peeking out. My reaction to him never seemed to shock me. He was beautiful, and he was mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that thing I said we\u2019d do tonight?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cVaguely.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled in return, coming toward me. He brushed a finger against my cheek, his eyes penetrating. The glow of candlelight cast shadows against his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been stressed.\u201d When I began to say something, Adam continued, \u201cI thought you deserved a night where you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about wandering eyes, conversation, or threats. I planned to do this at the ceremony the other night, but this is more fitting. I don\u2019t need an audience to pledge myself to you, Chante. The only person I need to know how devoted I am to you is you.\u201d</p><p>Realization set in. Adam was recreating his own ceremony, and it was far better than the original. He stood in front of me and began to work the buttons of his shirt, his eyes still on my face. Mine were watching the reveal of taut skin over hard muscle. Adam could make me forget an apocalypse, so long as he was undressing in front of me and looking at me with that glint in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie and say that you questioning our union hasn\u2019t bothered me, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not questioning it,\u201d I lied. \u201cI\u2019m ... it\u2019s just complex. I\u2019m not use to being in a relationship, much less one with a royal werewolf. And now we\u2019re bonded ... it just makes it more complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Adam said, un-tucking his shirt and sliding it off his body. He slipped off his shoes and began working the button on his jeans. My eyes tracked each movement as anticipation rushed through my body. My wolf was alive and ready for a night with her mate.</p><p>\u201cI know you have a bit of a commitment phobia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d I told him. \u201cI am one hundred percent committed to you, Adam. It\u2019s the link we share that worries me.\u201d</p><p>He slipped out of his jeans and rested his hands on his hips. A tingle skipped up my thighs as I stared at the \u201cV\u201d of his hipbones. I wanted to kiss that spot.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I can say to change your mind, Anna, but I do know this: you are mine. Not just for the moment. You will be mine until there is no me, because death is the only thing that I\u2019ll allow to tear us apart. This thing between us isn\u2019t just a bond or another relationship. It runs deeper than any of that.\u201d He stepped toward me and cupped my face. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I lived before you, but I damn sure won\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>I was beginning to get nervous. \u201cWhy would you think you\u2019d have to live without me?\u201d</p><p>His lips straightened into a hard line. \u201cI got curious about what my mother said to you, so I asked her. She didn\u2019t come right out and say it, but from what she told me, I know she\u2019s trying to convince you to leave. And by the way you\u2019ve been acting about our bond and your vision, I know you\u2019re entertaining the idea.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t miss the anger in his voice or the hurt clouding his eyes. He made it seem like it was a done deal and it\u2019d been an easy decision to make. The fact that he thought I could make a decision like that so easily hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you enough that if you really wanted to leave, I\u2019d let you go, but if you\u2019re considering leaving simply because you think I\u2019m in danger, you wouldn\u2019t get off this mountain before I dragged your ass back here, Anna. I will fight for you\u2014for us\u2014until you realize the only place you belong is by my side.\u201d</p><p>Tears splashed against my cheeks. Adam swept a thumb across my face to brush them away.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning on leaving?\u201d</p> <p>I met his eyes, my hands shaking from the mixture of my own emotions combined with Adam\u2019s. We stared in silence for a long time before I answered. While I hadn\u2019t planned to leave, I did have to consider it, especially after the vision of Adam dying.</p><p>\u201cYou would be safe, and I care more about that than myself. If I walked away, it wouldn\u2019t be because I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Adam gave me a small smile. \u201cIt still bothers me that you even considered it, but I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s because you were thinking of my safety and not because you don\u2019t want to be with me. That being said, if you ever even think about leaving again, I will lock your ass in your room until you come to your senses. Have a little more faith in us, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, guilty and a little angry. Adam didn\u2019t understand where I was coming from, and if I were in his shoes, I might not have either. Adam didn\u2019t look at the scars on our palms as anything other than what they were\u2014a sign we were meant to be together. I, however, could see the curse through the love-induced fog. Being tied to anyone was dangerous. If that tether were cut, the other would suffer. How could he not see the weight of that resting on my shoulders? I knew the answer; it was his pride. It made him believe that he was strong enough to take care of both of us.</p><p>\u201cHave you had anyone check out the forest where I spotted the attacker?\u201d In the chaos of our guests and events, no one seemed to bat an eyelash at the attack from the ceremony. \u201cWade thinks it was a vampire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this tomorrow,\u201d Adam said. \u201cTonight, I have plans. I don\u2019t want to talk about anything other than the present.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to my dresser and lifted a small clay bowl I hadn\u2019t noticed before. Handing it to me, he said, \u201cLet me pledge my wolf to you, Chante.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a tightlipped smile and nodded. Being a young werewolf, I hadn\u2019t come to respect the rituals the way Adam did. I could tell this meant a lot to him, so I wouldn\u2019t press the issues that were heavy in my mind. Tonight, I would give him what he wanted and try to pretend there wasn\u2019t a possible vampire trying to kill either Adam or me\u2014that the scars marring our palms weren\u2019t an invisible tether linking our souls together, and that whenever I looked into Adam\u2019s eyes, I didn\u2019t see the Adam from my visions dying. Sometimes, when you love someone, pretending is the only thing you can do for him or her.</p><p>Adam transformed into his wolf. I envied the graceful transition. He did it with such ease. A large black wolf stood in front of me, its shoulders coming to my waist. Reaching a hand out, I ran my fingers through Adam\u2019s inky fur and bent down to kiss the top of his head. My wolf turned to goo, warming me from the inside out.</p><p>Setting the clay bowl down, I tugged my tank top over my head to expose my stomach. Standing, I picked up the bowl and held it out to Adam. We watched each other in silence. I couldn\u2019t help myself\u2014a smile bent my lips. I loved Adam; I loved everything about him. When I first arrived at the compound, I\u2019d thought I was crazy when I watched a man transform into a beast. Now, when I saw Adam standing on all fours, my heart swelled with an unfathomable amount of all the great emotions: love, pride, lust, and happiness. Knowing you\u2019re where you\u2019re supposed to be is a profound feeling. I knew whenever I looked at Adam he was my home. All the times I felt lost in my life, felt like I was stumbling through life only to find another dead end, it all led me to this moment. It led me to his arms.</p><p>Adam dipped the pad of his paw into the mixture and reached out to me. I expected him to place his mark on my stomach like the others had. He didn\u2019t. He reached up and placed his paw on my chest. I looked down at the mark of his paw print over my heart and closed my eyes. A livewire of energy filled me, rushing through my veins and filling me with power. I took a shuddered breath, opening my eyes to find Adam in human form again. I panted as though I\u2019d just run ten miles and was coming down from the exertion.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pretty amazing high, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, looking up at Adam. I thought the energy of having my pack pledge themselves to me was powerful. It was weak compared to the power consuming me now. I looked down again and watched as Adam\u2019s paw print dissolved into my skin. Throwing my head back, I closed my eyes and panted. I was alive and on fire, an alpha in a sea of betas. It was exhilarating and amplified every emotion filling me. I locked eyes with Adam and charged him.</p><p>Wrapping my arms around his neck, I dragged my mouth across his and slipped my tongue inside. I moaned as his tongue tangled with mine. His hands were everywhere, roaming my back, my behind, and in my hair, stoking the fire already filling me. My mind was on one track, and the destination was Adam. I worked the button on my shorts and let them fall to my feet. Next were my panties. I couldn\u2019t get naked fast enough, and when my underwear tangled around my ankles, a growl slipped up my throat. Adam laughed, helping me out of my lingerie debacle.</p><p>When I was free, he hoisted me up. I wrapped my legs around his waist, and together we slammed against the wall. Adam fisted my hair and tugged my head to the side, his mouth searing a path along my neck. Thrusting upward, he buried himself in me. I dug my fingernails into his shoulders as he pounded into me relentlessly. One of his hands came up to palm my breast. He worried my nipple between his fingers, pinching slightly. A deep guttural moan fell from my lips as I worked my hips against his thrusts. I was lost in a lust-induced fog, needing more of Adam. My number one priority was finding that sweet release only he could provide.</p><p>Adam leaned in for a kiss, this time slower. He trailed the tip of his tongue along my bottom lip before delving into my mouth. He kissed me with precision, turning my legs to jelly and causing my toes to curl. He slowed his rapid pumps to meet the rhythm of his kiss. Gripping my hips, he thrust into me hard, only to withdraw slowly and repeat the process.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s so fucking good,\u201d I said.</p><p>Adam growled, his fingers digging into my hips. Our eyes connected, and then the floodgates of ecstasy burst open, and I was riding another delicious high. My legs trembled around his hard waist as he continued to move inside of me. When he was happy that I was done, Adam walked over to the bed and lay me down so that I was on my stomach. Reaching an arm under me, he lifted my behind into the air and then he was filling me again.</p> <p>He leaned over my back, his hair tickling my shoulders. With one hand on my hip, he used the other to turn my face toward him and claimed my mouth. I fisted my hands in the sheet, quivering as he enticed my sensitive folds for another orgasm. That exciting tingle built back up with each pump of his hips.</p><p>Adam stopped, withdrawing himself from me. \u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>I did as he said and flipped onto my back, my behind at the edge of the mattress. Adam knelt down in from of me, his hands sliding up my thighs to spread me open before him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful, Chante. So fucking eager for me all the time.\u201d He lowered his mouth to me, his tongue replacing the disappearance of his dick. I wanted to wrap my legs around his head but he held them open, spread eagle on my bed, as his tongue licked, prodded, and penetrated my swollen folds. I whimpered, moaned, and was panting by the time he lifted his head. With one last soft kiss, Adam gripped my hips and buried himself in me again. I was on the edge, tiptoeing, and on the verge of falling off. I closed my eyes as I waited for yet another Earth shattering release.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes,\u201d Adam said, pumping into me hard. \u201cI want to see that look when you come for me, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes and met his. Locked in each other\u2019s gazes, Adam increased his thrusts, pumping into me harder and harder.</p><p>\u201cWhose are you, Chante?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d I breathed, yearning for the pressure to break free.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. You\u2019re mine. You will always be mine.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, words failing my foggy brain. Then that sweet release was mine\u2014washing through me and giving my body what it desired. I stared up at Adam and bit my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I can feel you twitching around me.\u201d With one last thrust, Adam too found his release. He rested his sweaty forehead against my chest, placing a kiss at my cleavage. We took a couple minutes to catch our breath. I ran my fingers through Adam\u2019s hair and along his shoulders. My body was still amped up from his pledge, but sated enough that I didn\u2019t feel like I was going to jump out of my skin.</p><p>Adam moved down my body. Gripping my waist with both hands, he placed a kiss to my navel. He looked up the length of me, his eyes softening.</p><p>\u201cThe heat will be consuming you soon.\u201d</p><p>I thought he was trying to sexy talk and smiled. \u201cI think it already has.\u201d</p><p>Adam laughed and lay beside me, propping himself up on an elbow. \u201cI mean, heat as in ovulation, Anna. Every female werewolf goes through it twice a year, and you\u2019re six months old. It\u2019ll be happening soon.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught in my throat. Babies, that\u2019s what he was talking about? My relaxation dissolved, nervousness taking its place. I shot up in bed and took a moment to wrap my head around what he was saying. I made sure to stay on the pill even after turning. I wasn\u2019t ready for a baby at twenty-three.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Chante?\u201d</p><p>I half turned, looking at Adam. \u201cAre you saying you want to have kids ... already? We\u2019ve only been together for a couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>Adam sat up and held my hand. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-nine, Anna. I always imagined having kids, but never found the right woman to give them to. It would make me very happy to see your swollen belly, knowing it was my child growing inside you. I can see you\u2019re apprehensive, but when the heat is upon you, you\u2019ll want them as much as I do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stood, hugging my arms to my chest. \u201cI\u2019m thinking clearly now, and I\u2019m telling you I\u2019m not ready. When I go into heat, it\u2019ll be my wolf wanting them\u2014not me.\u201d</p><p>Adam let out a heavy breath. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was out of anger or contemplation over the discussion. My hands drifted down to my flat stomach. Then a thought occurred to me; if I was on the pill, how could I get pregnant even in heat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to quit taking the pill, Adam. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>Adam watched me, his mouth opening and then shutting. He looked away and then back at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur bodies burn off human drugs quickly, but when you\u2019re in heat, your body will burn through them twice as fast. The best possible way to avoid getting pregnant during that time is sustaining from sex, and believe me, that will be the last thing on your mind. When our mates are in heat, we males become ravenous. I remember Alec and his wife not coming out of their bedrooms for three days.\u201d Adam stood and came toward me, placing his hands on my shoulders. \u201cWould it be so bad to carry my child, Anna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it\u2019s only been a couple weeks and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe vision, Adam. It freaks me out that you\u2019re not worried about it, and if you were to die, how could I raise a child on my own? I would be devastated, useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. I think you had that vision so we could stop it. It was a gift from the spirits. Most people don\u2019t get warnings and are caught off guard. We won\u2019t be. As for the length of time we\u2019ve been together, I wanted you as the mother of my children from the moment I first laid eyes on you. I knew right then that you were it for me. Whether we\u2019ve been together for a day or ten years, you will always be the one.\u201d</p><p>Adam always said the right things, words made to make women swoon and fall at his feet. My anxiety lessened, but my mind didn\u2019t change. I knew kids were not in my immediate future.</p><p>\u201cWould you hate me if I told you I wanted to wait?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you understand what you\u2019re saying and the intensity to which your desires will be during the heat, but I could never hate you, Chante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen lock me up in the cage in the basement if you have to, but I will not lose my wits simply because my body is under some kind of baby-making spell. I will endure the torture so long as a decision isn\u2019t made with a horny brain.\u201d</p> <p>Adam laughed. \u201cI will be in torture, too. My dick will be fighting to fill you and spill my seed into your womb. It will be agony.\u201d</p><p>This werewolf thing just kept getting better and better. The cage in the basement was built for new werewolves. It was the perfect solution, but it wouldn\u2019t help Adam.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like you\u2019ll be tugging your meat stick until it passes.\u201d</p><p>Adam grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t tugged the meat stick since I was in high school.\u201d</p><p>A thought occurred to me and turned my stomach inside out. \u201cHow did Eve not get pregnant? If the heat is so overpowering, how is it that you didn\u2019t have children with her?\u201d I hated asking about Eve, or even thinking about her with Adam. I didn\u2019t care that he was hers before me. She\u2019d been psychotic and unfaithful to Adam, sleeping with his brother.</p><p>\u201cI ordered her to stay away from me during that time.\u201d Adam shrugged and sat down. \u201cI was mated to her so it was my duty to impregnate her during that time, and I knew I did not want kids with that woman. Our union was political, and I didn\u2019t want to bring children into something like that. She disappeared during the heat and came back after it was over. I always assumed she went to Anthony, but I never asked. I didn\u2019t care. She never carried, though. I don\u2019t know if she couldn\u2019t have children, or if Anthony\u2019s wolf refused her during that time because she was mated to me. Our wolves are very possessive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cAnthony could fuck Eve all the time while not in heat, but once it was upon her, his wolf would have rejected what he knew wasn\u2019t his.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned, thinking for a moment. \u201cBut you said even the men go crazy. Why would his wolf reject her when she was out of her mind with horniness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget there\u2019s still so much you don\u2019t know,\u201d Adam added. \u201cMated wolves cheat from time to time\u2014\u201d</p><p>I gasped, surprised by the confession. Was he saying he had cheated on me because it was a normal werewolf thing to do? Vomit crawled up my throat at the thought of him with another woman.</p><p>\u201cNot me, Anna. I would never do that. You are the only woman I will ever want. I don\u2019t look at any other women in that way. I just meant, some men look outside of their unions for sex\u2014mostly because their pairings weren\u2019t for the right reasons. But during our woman\u2019s heat, it\u2019s in our DNA to produce offspring with our mate\u2014the woman we vowed ourselves to as a way to grow our bloodlines. We would never want children with one of our mistresses.\u201d</p><p>The meaning dawned on me, and anger filled me. \u201cYou mean because your mistresses are mutts, right? You wouldn\u2019t want to soil the alpha bloodline with dirty blood. Why the hell do you want a kid with me then? Last time I checked, I was a mutt, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re a mutt, Anna. You\u2019ve had alpha tendencies since you first turned. You may not have been born alpha, but make no mistake, you are alpha.\u201d</p><p>I started getting dressed, pissed beyond belief. Sure, Adam thought I had alpha tendencies and we were paired together, but had we not bonded, he wouldn\u2019t have wanted children with me. Would he have even made me his mate?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting dressed and leaving.\u201d</p><p>Adam yanked my clothes from my hands and threw them across the room. He curled his fingers around the back of my neck and held me in place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blowing this out of proportion. You know I don\u2019t think of you as a mutt. I am proud that you\u2019re my mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you don\u2019t think of me as one, doesn\u2019t mean that isn\u2019t what I am, Adam. Had the Chante mark not appeared, would you even be with me right now, or still trying to make me your mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Adam growled. \u201cYou know damn well I never wanted you as a mistress. I never treated you as such so get that thought out of your head right now. Don\u2019t throw your insecurities onto me.\u201d</p><p>I snorted in derision. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d I retorted. \u201cYou tried sleeping with me while with Eve. You told me that you couldn\u2019t leave her because it was your duty to be mated to her. How is that not treating me like a mistress? And the only reason it didn\u2019t work was because I didn\u2019t fall at your feet and worship you like every other pack whore.\u201d</p><p>Adam gripped my arm and tossed me onto the bed. Spreading my legs, he positioned himself at my center, his erection pressing against my folds. Without warning, he buried himself in me and began moving his hips.</p><p>\u201cI want you to listen to what I\u2019m saying and believe it word for word,\u201d he said, thrusting harder, deeper. \u201cI never tried to turn you into a whore or thought of you in those terms. You cannot hold my merit against me. Staying with Eve was just as much for the pack\u2019s benefit as it was yours.\u201d Adam gripped my hips and yanked me against him hard so my center met him thrust for thrust. I moaned despite myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you by my side since you appeared on my mountain, Anna. I didn\u2019t care who you were, where you came from, or if you had a man. The only reason I kept my distance is because I knew it wasn\u2019t fair to want you while I was mated. Make no mistake that I will never stop wanting you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth clamped down on my breast, his tongue twirling around my erect nipple. I writhed beneath him, my hands going to his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cFucking you is a perk,\u201d Adam growled. \u201cHaving you by my side is the real reward. Do. Not. Ever. Forget. That.\u201d</p><p>We both came at the same time, and boy did that orgasm blow the other two out of the water. It was raw, angry, and amazing. My anger dissipated with my release, my body limp and exhausted.</p><p>\u201cWe got way off track,\u201d Adam said, standing up. \u201cI didn\u2019t set all this up to talk about babies, or what some purebred men do. I had a plan, and you come in here and made me forget myself. Stubborn ass woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, disgruntled. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who brought up babies or mistresses. That was all you.\u201d</p><p>Adam turned, grinning while he pulled on a pair of nylon track pants. My eyes absorbed his thick shoulders, and slim waist, and all the ridges of muscles making up his flat stomach. No matter how frustrated or mad I got with him, it all faded away when I thought with the shallow part of my brain. I couldn\u2019t help it; the man was scrumptious.</p><p>Going to my dresser, Adam took out a cotton nightgown and handed it to me. Sitting up, I slipped it on and pulled my hair into a ponytail. It was sticky with sweat. I\u2019d definitely have to take a shower before I even thought about sleeping.</p><p>\u201cSo, what was your plan?\u201d</p><p>Adam reached into his pants pocket and knelt before me. Reaching a hand up, he trailed soft fingertips along my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou have done nothing but test me since the first moment you arrived. You defied me at every turn, talked back, and made me crazy. I\u2019ve never met a woman with a head as hard as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said. \u201cYour plan was to put me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Anna,\u201d Adam snapped. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, despite how frustrated I get with you, I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing about you. I love your strong will and your passion. I love that your left eye crinkles when you\u2019re mad. I love that you crack your knuckles when you\u2019re nervous. I love that even though you put on a brave face, your insecurities show when you don\u2019t think anyone is looking. I love that you don\u2019t back down from me or anyone else. I love every single cell that makes you who you are. And I would love it if you said yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I\u2019d been staring into his eyes, engrossed in every single word that fell from his lips. Adam motioned with his eyes, and I finally looked down, and my lungs ceased to work. Sitting in a black velvet box sat a sparkly diamond ring.</p><p>\u201cI have you as my mate and my chante,\u201d Adam said, taking the ring and lifting my left hand. \u201cSay you\u2019ll be my wife, too.\u201d</p><p>I was having a mini panic attack. It was rare for wolves to get married. Most believed taking one as a mate was good enough. Our beliefs in our animals were stronger than human traditions. Adam was giving himself entirely to me. In every possible way, he would own me, and I would own him. I never believed in marriage, not because I didn\u2019t have a healthy example; I did. My parents were very happy and had been married for twenty-five years before they died. I\u2019d just seen too many marriages fail. So why, when I looked at Adam, did I want to say yes?</p> <p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I met Adam\u2019s eyes again and smiled. \u201cYour parents are going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>The full moon was tonight, and we were all antsy. I\u2019d slipped away from the house and found myself at the lake I\u2019d shared with Sawyer. I kicked off my shoes and walked through the shallow water, twirling the huge diamond on my left hand. I still hadn\u2019t talked to Elle, and it hurt. I wanted to run to her after I said yes to Adam, but after our fight, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be receptive to my excitement. As far as I knew, Adam\u2019s parents hadn\u2019t heard about our engagement. I could already hear Maggie\u2019s next speech. I was trying my hardest not to let her voice penetrate my head. I knew the complications and danger regarding my bond with Adam, but I also knew we would both be miserable without each other.</p><p>I turned my hand over and examined the Chante mark. My entire palm was a raised scar. A design that looked like a four-leaf clover took up most of the space while an infinity symbol ran horizontally across it. A circle encompassed the mark.</p> <p>A branch snapped just behind me. I whirled around, a growl vibrating up my throat. Since Adam pledging himself to me, my insecurities about fighting had faded away. The power running through me was strong and left me hyperaware of everything around me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Chelsea said, holding her hands up in surrender. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to sneak up on you.\u201d</p><p>Just behind her, Sage, Elle, Rachel, and Chloe stepped through the trees. Now that I was paying attention, I could hear more people coming. I guess I wasn\u2019t hyperaware when lost in my own thoughts. I\u2019d have to learn to juggle the two things.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all itchy,\u201d Rachel said, coming toward me. \u201cSage suggested we go for a swim, said it helps calm her down during the full moon.\u201d</p><p>This would be Chelsea\u2019s first full moon. I remembered how anxious I\u2019d been during mine\u2014feeling my wolf pushing forward, but not breaking free. It was uncomfortable at first and sensual. The brush of our beast beneath our skin amped up our already sensitive sex drives.</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Chelsea hugged her arms to her chest and then let them fall to her sides, only to cross them again. Yeah, she was anxious and revved up. Her curly brown hair blew back with the breeze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to get used to it, ya know? I mean, up until two weeks ago, I didn\u2019t even know stuff like this really existed, and now I\u2019m living it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI felt the same way when it happened to me. I even refused to believe they were werewolves, even when Joe stripped in front of me and transformed. I was convinced it was some sort of parlor trick.\u201d</p><p>Chelsea smiled at me. \u201cHow long did it take for you to come to terms with it?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI think I\u2019m still coming to terms with it, but I accepted it after about two months. It\u2019s scary, I know, but it\u2019s also pretty damn cool. The Everwood pack is great, and we\u2019re lucky to be part of their pack. Some of the other packs aren\u2019t as laid back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurning me into the live-in maid doesn\u2019t seem that laid back to me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed because I\u2019d felt the same way when I was the live-in maid. Everyone pulled his or her weight in the pack. It just happened that newbies pulled a little more.</p> <p>\u201cI wholeheartedly agree with you on that one. It sucks, but you have Elle and me to help you out whenever you need it.\u201d</p><p>Chelsea\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cI could never ask one of my alphas for help. This thing inside of me quivers anytime we\u2019re around one of you, like its scared or something.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, remembering how I felt being around Adam and Eve. Our wolves respected their alphas, and now I was one. It was bizarre.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told her. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be afraid of either one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChelsea, you wanna help me with this stuff?\u201d</p><p>We both turned to see Elle carrying a big cooler with a radio balanced on top. Our eyes met, and she looked away. The little shun hit me in the gut. Elle was the first wolf to befriend me when I came to the mountain. I hated that I had snapped at her.</p><p>\u201cYou stay here,\u201d I told Chelsea. \u201cI\u2019ll help her.\u201d</p><p>Walking over to Elle, I grabbed the radio right before it fell off the cooler. \u201cHey, sorry about last night. I was a little moody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little? You were on the verge of paranoia.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a small smile. \u201cYeah, sorry. Grace under fire, I am not.\u201d</p><p>Elle\u2019s eyes widened, and she set the cooler down, reaching for my left arm. She brought my hand up and examined my new ring.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, he proposed?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, a wide smile stretching my lips. \u201cLast night.\u201d</p><p>Chloe came up beside us, her eyes glaring at my new, sparkly accessory. My smile grew bigger while my inner voice said, Take that, bitch.</p><p>\u201cHas Maggie or Donald seen this?\u201d Chloe asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll scurry off and tell them the good news.\u201d</p><p>Chloe growled, her anxious wolf coming to the surface. Elle gasped, stepping in front of me. As her alpha female it was her job to protect me, but after getting a dose of Adam\u2019s power, I was capable of ripping her head off.</p><p>I stepped around Elle and allowed my own wolf to surface. A menacing snarl ripped from my lips as I stared the jealous Chloe in the eye. It was a challenge. Whoever looked away first bowed down to the other. There was no way in hell I was backing down from this tramp.</p><p>\u201cYou have something to say to me, Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch,\u201d Chloe snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve an alpha, let alone an olde blood. I was the next in line.\u201d</p><p>That brought me up short. There was a line of mates for Adam?</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll have to keep waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Adam\u2019s voice boomed through the space. Everyone fell silent as he approached us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying this mutt?\u201d Chloe spit out. \u201cYou\u2019re going to taint the Everwood bloodline with this whore.\u201d</p><p>All I saw was red. My vision blurred as rage consumed not only me, but my wolf, too. My fist was sailing through the air before I realized I even lifted my arm. My knuckles connected with Chloe\u2019s nose, a sickening crack sounding. She screeched, her hands coming up to cradle her bleeding nose.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch.\u201d She charged me, but Adam\u2019s arms banded around her waist. He threw her off, and she landed on her ass five feet in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou are a guest on my mountain, Chloe,\u201d Adam growled. \u201cAnd you come here and insult my choices and mate? I want you gone by sundown. Tell my parents their plan backfired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Chloe said incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to pick her over me, a pureblood wolf from a respectable clan? You\u2019ve lost your fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>One of the scariest growls I\u2019ve ever heard traveled out of Adam\u2019s lips. Chloe had the decency to flinch and lower her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSay one more thing ... I dare you,\u201d Adam challenged.</p><p>Chloe shook her head with a snort, turning and running through the forest. Adam turned to face the group. His hands fisted at his side, and his chest puffed up from anger.</p><p>\u201cIf there are any other mother fuckers who have a problem with Anna, I\u2019ll give you two choices: leave my mountain, or step up and get your ass beat. Anyone?\u201d</p><p>Heads shook all around, people amped up from the fight and the coming full moon. A lot of orange and yellow eyes stared back at us. It was eerily beautiful.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Adam said. \u201cLet\u2019s have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Chloe batted for your team?\u201d I asked Elle. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a gay person having bad gay-dar.\u201d</p><p>Elle splashed water in my face. \u201cI have excellent gay-dar, thank you very much. A blind person couldn\u2019t miss the way she eye-fucked me the night she arrived.\u201d Elle flipped onto her back and floated. \u201cI think she\u2019s bi, though, and I\u2019m sure Adam\u2019s parents used their powers of persuasion to coerce her into going after Adam. The Everwoods are nothing if not persistent.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a moment. Adam knew what his parents were up to if his words to Chloe had any truth in them. I guess it wasn\u2019t a secret; I mean, Maggie did dote on Chloe while looking down her nose at me. It didn\u2019t matter that she was a vile woman. Maggie only cared about the blood running through her veins. I was done listening to any plea Maggie threw my way. I would not allow her to make me feel bad about Adam\u2019s and my relationship. Her desperate attempts to get me to run had more to do with getting me out of the picture than it did with the safety of her son. I still had my doubts and still entertained the idea of how much safer Adam would be if I weren\u2019t here to distract him, but I couldn\u2019t fathom leaving him either. Then the vision of his dying body popped into my head, and leaving didn\u2019t seem so bad if it meant he would be safe.</p><p>It was a vicious game of tug-of-war inside my head, one that would only produce losers. If I left, we would be miserable, and if I stayed, I was a liability to his life. If worse came to worse, and another attack happened, Adam would put himself in the line of fire to save me, just like he had at the ceremony. I knew when the shit hit the fan Adam\u2019s mind would be focused on my wellbeing alone. In that state of mind he couldn\u2019t look after and direct the pack like he\u2019s supposed to. And I knew he knew this too, because when the pack was planning to take down Eve and Anthony\u2019s secret bunker, he\u2019d forced me to go to California with Elle. He knew if I stayed, he couldn\u2019t do his job, not with a clear head anyway, and having cloudy judgment in the face of danger is a one-way ticket to the grave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I floated in one spot, kicking my legs and swaying my arms through the cool water. The lake was full of people, all rough housing. There were a few people playing a game of chicken and a lot of flirting going on. The full moon brought out our friskiness. I watched the scene, remembering the last time I\u2019d been here. I searched for Sawyer, but couldn\u2019t pick him out of the crowd. Maybe he wasn\u2019t even here. This was our lake, the spot we\u2019d skinny-dipped at before we gave into our desire and slept together along the shoreline, and Adam had witnessed it.</p><p>I pushed the thought aside, it was a memory best left alone. My eyes flitted along the tree line. I didn\u2019t understand how everyone could be so blissfully blind to his or her surroundings. Why wasn\u2019t anyone else worried about the attacker from the ceremony? You\u2019d think a pack of wolves would be ready to hunt the son of a bitch down. Then another thought occurred to me; maybe Adam didn\u2019t want to draw attention to it. Was it because it would clarify how fragile our bond was, or because he wanted to appear strong and in control? Either way, I couldn\u2019t see the landscape without looking for movement of a second attack. If what Wade thought was true, and we were dealing with a vampire, then we were safe during the day, right? I was getting my facts from movies and stories; maybe vampires weren\u2019t allergic to the sun or garlic. Hell if I knew. One thing was for sure\u2014as soon as the full moon was over, I was buckling down and figuring this shit out.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>With so many wolves, we had to break people down in seven different teams. Each pack picked a designated Leader, and together they took down their meal. The Everwood pack stayed together, and now we feasted on a moose. I lay with my paws outstretched, a chunk of raw meat before me. My tongue slipped out and licked against my bloody muzzle. Adam lay beside me, busy with his own piece of the moose. We were deep in the mountains, tall pine and birch trees surrounding us. The cover of leaves and needles was so thick; the light of the full moon couldn\u2019t penetrate the coverage. The darkness was an opaque shroud veiling us. I knew a human wouldn\u2019t stand a chance of navigating through the inky oblivion.</p><p>In the distance, one of the packs howled. Adam was instantly on his feet, quirking his head to the side. The rest of us followed suit, tilting our heads to gauge their distance. Wolves howl to communicate with each other. Its instinctual and universal for every wolf. When another round of howling echoed through the tall snow-covered mountains, Adam\u2019s voice filled my head.</p><p>\u201cDo not wander from my side, Anna. Stay close, and follow my instructions to the T, understand?\u201d</p><p>Whatever had the other pack riled up wasn\u2019t good. Their calls warned of a threat, and I had a sneaking suspicion it was the same person who had shot Adam.</p><p>\u201cAnna!\u201d Adam growled when I still hadn\u2019t answered him.</p> <p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he replied and then began ordering the rest of the pack. \u201cI don\u2019t know which pack that is, but it sounds like it\u2019s coming from Trigger Lake. Joe, do you agree?\u201d</p><p>Just then another round of howling bounced off the mountains and trees, and then another pack joined in, singing their warning to the rest of us.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt sounds like it\u2019s coming from all around us.\u201d</p><p>He was right. With the way the mountains amplified their howls, we couldn\u2019t be sure which direction the pack was.</p><p>\u201cWe should split up,\u201d I added.</p> <p>\u201cI agree with her,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>It took Adam a split second before he too agreed with my decision. \u201cAnna, you\u2019re with me. Joe and Asher take eight wolves each. Joe head south, Asher west.\u201d</p><p>They got to work at picking their teams. I made sure Elle and Chelsea were with me and because Chelsea was with me, Wade was, too. It gave me peace of mind to know that he was looking out for her. Together, we ran through the mountain. I kept pace with Adam, flanking his right, while the others flanked me.</p><p>Another round of howls filtered through the trees.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Adam\u2019s voice filled our heads, and we all halted. His head swiveled around, his body turning in a circle as he took in the landscape.</p><p>\u201cThat one was close, but there\u2019s something else ...\u201d He lifted his head in the air and sniffed. A deep rumbling growl vibrated up his throat as his lips curled over sharp teeth. \u201cStay close, Anna. The rest of you fan out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I\u2019d just asked the question when the stale scent hit my nostrils; the same scent I had smelled the night of the ceremony. There was someone or something close. The hairs on the back of my neck rose as my eyes roamed over the inky darkness. There was a small clearing, enough to allow the glow of the moon to illuminate a portion of trees. The rustling of leaves drew my attention to the left, but I couldn\u2019t decipher if it was the breeze or something else.</p><p>\u201cUp ahead.\u201d Wade\u2019s voice filled my head, taking me by surprise. I was still new to this alpha thing. I suspected that only my pack could talk to me while in wolf form, but now that Adam had pledged himself to me, making me an alpha, I was open to all other alphas telepathically.</p> <p>Adam and I turned our heads at the same time. A lean body shrouded in darkness stepped out of the forest, its movements unhurried. My hackles rose while my lip curled up in a snarl.</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d Wade and Adam said in unison.</p><p>Adam moved closer to me, his ebony fur meshing with my ivory. \u201cDo not make rash decisions, do you hear me? Now is not the time to ignore my warnings.\u201d</p><p>Since I\u2019d never dealt with a vampire, let alone met one, I wasn\u2019t about to run off halfcocked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I told him. \u201cI have no plans to die tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty, pretty wolf.\u201d A raspy feminine voice carried across the open space and to my ears. My wolf perked up in anger, itching to charge forward and take down the new threat.</p><p>\u201cThree more,\u201d Elle called.</p><p>I spared a glance behind us and found three more bodies emerging from the forest. Why were vampires in the forest on a full moon? I was sure their sudden appearance on our mountain was more calculated than coincidence.</p><p>\u201cKeep a ring around Anna,\u201d Adam ordered.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d I snapped. \u201cNo one person in this group is more important than the other. No one will die protecting me because you are overprotective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Anna,\u201d Adam responded. Even his inner voice has a growl to it. \u201cJust remain with the group and let me deal with this.\u201d</p><p>Dealing with it was the problem. Since it was the full moon, we couldn\u2019t change into our human forms and communicate with the vampires. Then again, being in our wolf forms offered more protection. We were stronger, faster, and more lethal on four paws, and something told me we would have to be. I didn\u2019t think these bloodsuckers showed up to rub our bellies.</p><p>\u201cAnna Avery?\u201d the female vampire asked, pointing a finger toward me. Now that she was closer, I could make out her features: tall and thin with shoulder-length dark hair. She wore skinny jeans with knee-high boots and a cropped leather jacket. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but she wasn\u2019t it. If it weren\u2019t for the stale odor coming from her, I wouldn\u2019t have even known she was supernatural.</p><p>Adam growled, pushing into me so that I had to step back. I bumped into another body and noticed the wolves had listened to his orders and formed a circle around me. I might have had insecurities where fighting was concerned, but since transcending into an alpha, those uncertainties had vanished. Now, all I worried about was those around me. Chelsea was barely two weeks old. It should have been her we protected.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this two ways,\u201d the female vampire said. \u201cYou can either surrender yourself, Anna Avery, or we can take you and kill your wolves in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsher, Joe, head back toward us,\u201d Adam ordered. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about moving, Anna.\u201d</p><p>I thought about the wolves surrounding me, putting their lives on the line to protect me, and it made me sick to my stomach. Knowing I could return the favor and save their lives tempted me to step forward. If the vampires were on the mountain just for me, then I would make sure that no one got hurt on my account.</p><p>Ignoring Adam, I took a step forward. Adam whipped his head around and full out growled in my face.</p><p>\u201cGet. Back. Now. It\u2019s not the time to play the hero.\u201d</p><p>My steps faltered only because I knew if something happened to me, it would ruin Adam. Had it not been for our bond, I would have pushed forward and surrendered myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be puppy dog?\u201d</p><p>The vampire was answered with growls, snaps, and snarls. Her cherry red lips curled up in a sinister smile.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would say that,\u201d she said right before she disappeared. I blinked, staring at the empty space she\u2019d just occupied. A whimper tore through the still night. Whirling around, the other vampires had attacked our small pack. When I began forward, something snagged my tail and halted me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThey\u2019re more than capable of taking care of themselves. Just stay close and wait for Asher and Joe\u2019s group to get here.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at Adam\u2019s black wolf with disbelief. Another whimper burned my ears, drawing my attention back to the fight. A vampire\u2014a man with a shaved head\u2014had Wade by the throat and was lifting him off the ground. Another man was taunting Chelsea, tapping her muzzle and then disappearing when she snapped at his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe have to help them,\u201d I said before ripping my tail from Adam\u2019s sharp teeth and charging forward. My tail would probably have a bald spot, but that was the least of my worries. I couldn\u2019t stand by and play spectator while our pack was being attacked.</p><p>Leaping, I landed on the vampire that had a hold of Wade. My teeth sunk into his shoulder until a warm spray of blood flooded my mouth. He dropped Wade and began flailing back and forth to throw me off, but my teeth were firmly locked into muscle. If I was thrown off, a little piece of this vampire was coming with me.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d I heard the echo of Adam\u2019s voice in my head, but was too concentrated on the vampire. I yanked backwards, angling my paws against the vampire\u2019s back. More blood filled my mouth, its staleness coating my tongue and teeth. The man fell backward right before I jumped off his back. Just as I was about to strike his throat, Adam\u2019s large body shoved me out of the way. With a feral growl, he struck the vampire\u2019s jugular and yanked his head to the side, ripping out his throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t have time to admire his lethal move; something hit my side hard and knocked the wind out of my lungs. I skittered across the rough ground, my vision blurry for a moment. When I regained my footing, the first vampire was heading toward me. A smile still on her face, she flashed her fangs. My wolf was pissed, her anger causing our entire body to shake with it. She charged and so did the vampire. Right before we hit each other, the woman winked.</p><p>I never got the chance to tear her to shreds, though; Adam stepped in and did that for me. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was still reeling from the adrenaline-laced fury, or annoyed that Adam was playing white knight and treating me like a damsel in distress. Either way, I was pissed off.</p><p>My eyes cut to the other wolves and the vampires they were fighting. I was just about to help Chelsea when more wolves broke through the tree line, rushing toward the attacking bloodsuckers. I recognized our pack, but couldn\u2019t identify the visiting wolves. A big silver wolf headed toward me, his paws beating against the dry earth as he surged forward. His citrine eyes burned into mine, angry and determined. He wasn\u2019t a wolf from the Everwood pack, that was for sure. When he reached me Adam\u2019s voice filled my head.</p> <p>\u201cAnna, go with Anthony and take Chelsea with you.\u201d</p><p>That surprised me, not just because Adam was willingly letting me go with his brother, but also because he wasn\u2019t coming with me. I eyed the huge silver wolf with trepidation, unsure if the sudden vampire population was because of him. They were here for me, and if there was one person who wanted to hurt Adam, it was his brother. Was he going to lead me to safety or into a trap?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay and help you fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t. Go. Now.\u201d</p><p>Chelsea appeared by my side, and I had a split second to decide if I was going to ignore Adam or go. What made my decision easy was the idea of Anthony and Chelsea being alone together. If Anthony was up to no good, then I didn\u2019t want her in the middle of it again. She had already been turned into a wolf because of Eve\u2019s beef with me.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d I sent the message to Chelsea and began to run. She fell into stride beside me. Unfortunately, so did Anthony.</p><p>Once we were back at the house, Anthony, Chelsea, and I paced the front lawn. We were stuck as wolves until the sun rose. I was itchy in my skin, nervous about Adam fighting without me. The man was lethal for sure, but I still didn\u2019t like the idea of him being in danger while I was cowardly hiding at the house.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing, Chelsea?\u201d</p><p>Chelsea\u2019s wolf had a mixture of gray and black fur. Her face was lighter than the rest of her body, and her tail was tipped in white. Her wide yellow eyes squinted when she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cFine, considering. Why are they here for you?\u201d</p><p>I eyed Anthony. He was pacing back and forth, his eyes on the forest ahead. He was either anxious with the thought of the vampires following us or keyed up from the attack. He hadn\u2019t stopped moving since we arrived at the house.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d I said. \u201cAnthony?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to look back at me. \u201cYou think I summoned the bloodsuckers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFits your M.O. You made it clear the feud between you and Adam wasn\u2019t over. So what\u2019s your plan, to kill me because Adam killed Eve?\u201d I mentally snorted, knowing the sound would transfer through my thoughts, and he would hear it. \u201cI think I lost some respect for you for hiring killers rather than having the balls to do it yourself. Not that I had much respect for you before.\u201d</p><p>Anthony looked away, a snarl resonating in his throat. \u201cBelieve me, if I wanted you dead, you would be.\u201d He was quiet for a moment and then resumed pacing. After a long while, he stopped again.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to forget I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re even alive. I assume you asked Adam about the day he found you in the mountains?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still left me for dead, so don\u2019t pretend to be a hero. What if Adam hadn\u2019t come out and searched for me? He\u2019s the reason I\u2019m alive, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I should have let Eve finish what she started seeing as how it didn\u2019t make a difference?\u201d</p><p>The ball of nerves churning in my stomach amplified into fury. He seriously thought he was my savior. The idea of this vile man thinking I owed him something revolted me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you are any better than she was. You stuck beside her while she murdered innocent humans. You helped her kidnap me and watched as she smacked me around. You are just as screwed up as she was. You two belonged together.\u201d</p><p>Anthony quit moving and stood as still as a statue. My heart slammed in my chest as though it was trying to escape my ribcage. A prickle of energy ran across my skin as I readied myself for his move. I may not have alpha blood running through my veins, but the power coursing through me gave me courage. If Anthony attacked, I would be prepared.</p><p>Slowly, he turned, taking calculated steps toward me. His eyes were aflame as he stared me down. His shoulders were enormous as the muscles worked with his movements. Everything inside of me tensed the closer he got. I felt more than saw movement to my right, and I knew Chelsea was flanking me. As confident as I was, having her backup lent me extra peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to say this once,\u201d Anthony began. \u201cI loved Eve before I knew of her shortcomings, and when I learned of them I continued to love her. Love is not particular. It does not favor the good things while hating the bad. Those two emotions cannot dwell in the same heart. You either love or hate someone. I stood beside her, yes, but had it not been for me, your kidnapping would have been ten times worse. You may have trouble seeing my good through all the ugly, but whether you see it or not, it\u2019s there. Eve is dead, and I will not continue to pay for the things she did. I justify my actions to no one. Get off your fucking high horse, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what you say is true, and you stopped Eve from killing me on the mountain and supposedly going easy on me\u2014which I don\u2019t think she did\u2014while kidnapped, why did you do it?\u201d</p><p>I had a theory that I was not comfortable voicing. Just the idea of it made me cringe, but it was the only thing that made sense. Anthony had knocked me out after I crashed my truck, but afterward, he hadn\u2019t laid a finger on me. My subconscious kept urging me to believe he wasn\u2019t as bad as everyone suspected, but I tried to tune those thoughts out.</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want me to trust you and stop judging you for the things Eve did, then I need to know why?\u201d</p><p>Anthony\u2019s golden eyes glinted. \u201cAdam and I are twins ...\u201d He let the sentence trail off, but it confirmed my thoughts. I had always heard that twins were connected. Some even feel when their sibling is being hurt. Though Adam and Anthony weren\u2019t close, did they share each other\u2019s feelings?</p><p>\u201cSo ... are you saying you feel connected to me, and that\u2019s why you stopped Eve on the mountain that day?\u201d</p><p>I thought back to the day Eve attacked and changed my life forever. It took me almost four months to remember what had happened, and at first, I thought it was Adam with Eve. I remembered the look of compassion and remorse as he looked down at my bleeding body. Now, I knew it wasn\u2019t Adam at all. It was Anthony\u2019s eyes I saw the compassion in.</p><p>\u201cMaybe ... I don\u2019t know,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI have a strong urge to ...\u201d</p><p>The rest of the pack and the visiting wolves broke through the trees. Both our eyes went to them. A rush of relief flooded me at seeing Adam\u2019s large black body running toward me.</p><p>\u201cUrge to what?\u201d I asked Anthony, anxious to get the answer before Adam arrived.</p><p>Anthony\u2019s eyes cut to me and then back to the arriving wolves. \u201cProtect you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>After the full moon, wolves tended to sleep all the next day. I lay in bed, running my fingers through my hair as the rest of the house slept. My thoughts kept running from what Anthony said, to relief that Adam was lying next to me. I hadn\u2019t forgotten about the vision of him dying. Sometimes, it feels as though life is picking on you. The only thing I\u2019ve found that kicks life\u2019s ass is standing up and fighting back. I needed to figure out who summoned the vampires and worry about Anthony\u2019s confession later.</p><p>My mind wandered to Maggie. It wasn\u2019t a secret she wanted me out of Adam\u2019s life, but killing me wouldn\u2019t be smart. She knew my death would affect her son\u2019s wellbeing, which is why she had been trying to coerce me into leaving on my own. Giving up on Adam\u2019s overbearing mother, I thought about Chloe. If there was a line of mates for Adam\u2014which I still had to ask him about\u2014then Chloe could be a realistic suspect.</p><p>Frustrated, I turned and faced Adam. After he arrived back home last night he told me that none of the wolves were killed. Some walked away with injuries, but nothing that they wouldn\u2019t heal from. I lifted a strand of honeyed hair from his forehead and ran it through my fingertips. I watched his parted lips as he breathed evenly, lost in sleep. Bringing my hand up, I stared at the big solitaire diamond on my finger. The ring had double bands encrusted with smaller diamonds. Each one sparkled like a star. While a lot of little girls plan their wedding day, I wasn\u2019t one of them. I never got googly-eyed over gowns or diamond rings. A lot of my friends from high school had gotten married, and I remember thinking: suckers. I guess I was the sucker now. I\u2019d fallen head over heels for the man lying beside me and spending the rest of my life with him still wouldn\u2019t be long enough. He had the power to turn me into a sappy mess. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019d been missing all along\u2014a man capable of touching my heart. No other man had come close. Then again, none of them were my Chantes.</p><p>Tucking my sappy thoughts away, I climbed out of bed and headed toward the bathroom. When I was done with my shower, I made my way down the hallway in search of food. Two men slept on the large sectional in the living room, their arms dangling off the cushions.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d a male said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I spun on my heel and found Donald sitting at the table with the newspaper in his hands. I immediately went on alert. If chatting with him was going to be like my talks with his wife, then I wanted to be anywhere but in this kitchen.</p><p>I shrugged, opening the refrigerator. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p> <p>I heard Donald getting up, and my fingers squeezed around the edge of the fridge door. Closing my eyes, I sent up a silent prayer than he was leaving, that I wouldn\u2019t have to endure yet another speech about how his son and me weren\u2019t meant to be together. I had never thought of myself as having low self-esteem, but knowing that your fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents loathe you will do a number to a girl\u2019s ego.</p><p>\u201cI understand my wife has spoken with you?\u201d</p><p>With a heavy breath, I cursed the powers that be and shut the refrigerator. Turning to face my future father-in-law, I crossed my arms and stared across the room at him. He leaned against the counter, his hands hiding in his pants pockets.</p><p>\u201cYes, we talked,\u201d I said. \u201cWhile I think it\u2019s great you guys want what\u2019s best for Adam, I don\u2019t appreciate being judged based on the blood running through my veins. The Great Spirits are the ones who paired us as Chantes. How can you guys question their judgment?\u201d</p><p>In our mythology, The Great Spirits were the ancestors of the wolf. Every legend has a beginning; The Great Spirits are ours. I was never a spiritual person before becoming a wolf, but I felt a sense of pride when I transformed into my wolf, felt their presence every time I felt my paws beat against the earth and the wind in my fur.</p> <p>Donald chuckled softly. \u201cI see my Maggie has made an impression.\u201d</p><p>Understatement.</p><p>\u201cYou must realize, Anna,\u201d Donald continued, \u201cWe have never witnessed a pairing like yours. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but alpha born and made wolves simply do not become mates. The wolves are abuzz with the new development. I imagine my wife finds your relationship a tad embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>I began to speak, but Donald held up a hand to stop me.</p><p>\u201c... but that\u2019s her cross to bear. Her problems with you two stem from her ego. We are held in high regard with the wolves, and learning her son is mated to a non-alpha is a lot for her to accept. Adam is the alpha of his own pack now, and you\u2019re a baby to our world. You can see why she\u2019s worried, not to mention the bond between you two.\u201d</p><p>I was confused. Was he apologizing for his wife, or agreeing with her? Maybe his tactic was trying to get me to see reason. The only thing was, where love was concerned, there was no reason and Adam\u2019s and my relationship was more complex than the average. I wondered, not for the first time, if Adam and I weren\u2019t each other\u2019s Chantes, would we even be together? Sure, we loved each other, and I had a shiny diamond on my finger, but would our story still be the same had we not been marked for each other? After all, it wasn\u2019t like Adam ever proposed to Eve.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever met another couple that bonded?\u201d I asked Donald.</p><p>His aging face softened as he thought about my question. \u201cThere are stories of the Chante bond, but I have never met a bonded couple. As far as I know, the last bonded Chante couple was over a century ago. If it\u2019s happened since then, the couple has kept it hidden.\u201d</p><p>Donald closed the space between us and held out his hand, gesturing toward my own in question. Reluctantly, I placed my hand in his and watched as he turned it over to study my scarred palm. Softly, he traced the upraised pattern. My wolf quivered within me, sending goose bumps along my skin. The power of Adam\u2019s father filled the air around us, suffocating and strong.</p><p>\u201cSuch a tricky, tricky gift,\u201d Donald muttered.</p><p>My head fell to the side while my forehead wrinkled in question. He didn\u2019t notice my inquisitive look, though; his eyes were locked on the brand.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s more of a curse than a gift, right?\u201d I said after a while. \u201cMaggie informed me of that, too.\u201d</p><p>After a few moments, Donald met my eyes and dropped my hand. \u201cIt can be\u2014a curse, that is\u2014but it can also be used for great power. It links two people together. It doubles everything: power, strength, awareness. Two become one, making them ... unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>I snorted in derision. \u201cFor that to happen, your son would have to allow me to fight. He panics as soon as anything dangerous steps into my path.\u201d</p> <p>Donald gave me a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s in his blood to protect what is his, and you are very much his. Plus, as I said, the Chante bond can also be a curse. If something were to happen to you, it would destroy Adam. While he may be protecting you, he\u2019s also protecting his own life.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at this meaning. He was telling me that the reason Adam sent me away when things got dangerous was that he thought I was a liability and could do more good hiding out than helping him fight. It was true, I wasn\u2019t the best fighter before I got my honorary alpha status, but things had changed. I felt strong now, capable of taking on any wolf\u2014or vampire\u2014stupid enough to approach me. At that thought, another occurred to me. I needed to figure out who had hired vampires to kill me, and why. Was it to get to Adam, or to destroy him?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about the vampire attack last night, right?\u201d</p><p>Donald nodded his head. \u201cPeculiar occurrence. Vampires and werewolves don\u2019t cross paths often. We keep to ourselves and they to theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know who might have hired them?\u201d</p><p>The lines around Donald\u2019s eyes deepened. \u201cHired them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were here for me, to kill me. Do you know why a bunch of random vampires would just show up and want me dead?\u201d When Donald shook his head, I continued, \u201cThen it stands to reason that someone hired them to keep their hands clean. If a vampire killed me, then none of the wolves would be held responsible. The only thing is, I had a vision that it was Adam who died.\u201d</p><p>I normally didn\u2019t offer information about my visions to anyone other than those close to me, but I knew hearing this information would rile Donald up. Having him on my side wouldn\u2019t hurt, should things get out of control. Donald and Maggie may be pretentious and prejudice, but I knew they loved their sons. If someone planned to kill Adam, they sure as hell wouldn\u2019t stand by and allow it to happen. I thought about Anthony and what he had confessed last night, that he had the urge to protect me. Strange, yes, but my whole world had been strange since I turned into a werewolf. I knew I should have told someone, especially Adam, about this new information, but I also knew how pissed Adam would be. Anthony wasn\u2019t honorable like his brother. He had made one bad choice after another, but something deep inside of me could overlook all that. Maybe I, too, was aware of him as much as he was to me. Maybe, just maybe, my theory on the twins was right, and my bond with Adam extended to his brother. Not in the same sense, though, as I wasn\u2019t attracted to Anthony and didn\u2019t feel anything remotely as close to what I felt for Adam.</p><p>\u201cAnna, are you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, coming out of my thoughts to find Donald glaring at me. His hands curled into fists at his sides and his lips slanted down into a scowl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d</p><p>Donald stepped closer to me, his alpha power like lightning licking against my skin. My wolf writhed inside me with uneasiness.</p><p>\u201cWho did you see kill my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t.\u201d My voice came out as a stutter as I fought off the effects of his anger.</p><p>Donald raised his arms and curled his fingers around my shoulders. His fingers dug into my skin almost painfully. I looked up to meet his eyes, but the storm brewing behind them cowered me. Donald wasn\u2019t just an alpha, he was an olde blood and more powerful than even his son. My wolf whimpered inside me, scratching and clawing to get as far away from that angry stare as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you didn\u2019t?\u201d Donald snapped. \u201cYou said you had a vision of Adam dying. At whose hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please let go of me and take a step back? I can\u2019t concentrate when you\u2019re frightening my wolf.\u201d</p><p>With reluctance, Donald let go of my shoulders and stepped away from me. He crossed his arms and stood with his legs shoulder-width apart. The thickness of the air around me eased a little, and I could breathe better.</p><p>I took one long, deep breath and then explained the vision I had had of Adam dying. When I was done, Donald scrubbed a hand over his aging face and stared at the hardwood floor, as though it held all the answers. He didn\u2019t need to tell me how frustrated my vision made him; it did the same to me. What was the point in having visions if no helpful information could be extracted from them?</p><p>\u201cI planned to investigate further today,\u201d I told Donald. \u201cI want to know how to stop it just as much as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you plan to do that if you don\u2019t know who\u2019s responsible?\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m going back to the spot where the wolves fought the vampires last night. I\u2019m hoping by being there, touching the ground they walked on, another vision will appear, and I can learn more. No secrets stay hidden for very long.\u201d</p><p>Donald met my eyes and gave me a curt nod. \u201cIf you learn anything new, I want to know about it immediately.\u201d And with that, he stomped out of the kitchen. I didn\u2019t relax until the front door slammed shut, and I was standing in the kitchen alone.</p><p>I walked up a dirt trail that would lead to the clearing of the fight last night. Tall pine and birch trees lined either side of me, their limbs shadowing the earth. Thick, gloomy clouds hovered in the sky with the promise of snow. At this altitude, snow wasn\u2019t restricted to seasons\u2014it came year round. Angry blizzards suddenly erupted up here all the time. I eyed the clouds with disdain, hoping they held out until I was done. The cold wouldn\u2019t bother me, but investigating while tiny specks of snow bombarded my face was sure to make it difficult.</p><p>When the dirt road opened up into the clearing, I stopped and took in the scene. Broken branches and upturned grass was the only sign that something happened here last night\u2014that and ... blood? I raised my chin in the air and took in a deep breath, swiveling my face from left to right. It was blood, werewolf and vampire. The blood of the wolf smelled of rich earth and pine, whereas the vampires\u2019 smelled stale with an undertone of burnt hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Moving closer, I followed my nose to the scent. I knelt down and reached a hand out to a small pile of black ash. Dipping my fingers in the soot, I brought it to my nose and inhaled again. I didn\u2019t know a lot about vampires, but I could guarantee the ash on my fingertips was vampire blood, turned to ash when the sun rose. I watched in astonishment as small flakes danced up off my fingers and disintegrated into the air. The supernatural was amazing that way, erasing all traces of itself from the human world. Worried about losing my evidence, I fisted my hands into the pile of soot and held fistfuls of it in hopes of a vision. It didn\u2019t take long before the scenery before me disappeared and I was seeing the past of the vampire the blood belonged to.</p><p>I stood right next to a couple, a tall man with unruly brown hair and round hazel eyes and the woman from last night. From her dominance, I pieced together that she was in charge of the vampires. It was strange to be standing right next to their past selves. I half expected them to acknowledge me. I held my breath, remembering how ruthless the female vampire had been last night. She moved like the wind and hit like a wrecking ball. When their eyes didn\u2019t fall on me, I released the breath.</p><p>\u201cWe go tonight,\u201d the woman said. Her shoulder-length dark hair swayed to the side when she leaned over and zipped up her knee-high boot.</p> <p>I looked around the space, realizing we stood in a hotel room. Two queen beds with floral comforters occupied most of the room. A boxy television sat atop a wooden dresser, and a bathroom was at the back of the room.</p><p>The man moved to the window. With his pointer finger, he drew the curtain back just enough to see a sliver of the outside world. Light filtered into the dark room, and the man hissed and let his hand drop from the drapes. I guess it was true that any amount of daylight was like acid to these bloodsuckers.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know why we\u2019re doing this,\u201d the man said with irritation. \u201cSince when do we work for werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA payday is a payday,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI don\u2019t discriminate.\u201d She punctuated the sentence with a devilish smirk.</p><p>\u201cShe almost caught you the night of the ceremony,\u201d the man said. \u201cPlus, she\u2019s a white wolf. Even I know the legends, and they don\u2019t bode well for those who wish her harm.\u201d</p> <p>The woman scoffed. \u201cYou and your superstitions. That little bitch didn\u2019t come close to catching me, and I won\u2019t bat an eyelash at her being a white wolf when her own kind wants her dead. If they don\u2019t respect the legends, then why should I?\u201d</p><p>I could feel my lips peel open and my jaw drop. I remember how my pack reacted the first time I transformed into my wolf, and it was white. No one ever came out and said why they were so surprised, but whispers lingered around the mountain about it meaning something great. I had searched the book of our history for the answer, but nothing was written about white wolves. Hearing it was a legend, and that vampires had even heard of it, jarred me to my bones. From the moment my body accepted the werewolf virus, and I\u2019d become one of the monsters that only stories are made of, I\u2019d been different.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI\u2019ve been hungry for a good fight.\u201d</p><p>The man snorted as though he had heard the woman\u2019s zeal for violence before. He walked over to the bed and sat, resting his arms on his bent up knees. The woman walked over to him straddled his lap, causing the man to sit back. He rested his hands on the mattress behind him and looked up at her. The admiration in his eyes was unmistakable. A sense of unease filled me at witnessing such a private moment. It quickly vanished as I remembered that these two weren\u2019t two innocent lovers, they were plotting my death.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be okay, Taren,\u201d the woman said softer. \u201cWe\u2019ll rip that bitch\u2019s head from her shoulders and collect the six figure paycheck. After that, we\u2019ll take our vacation to Europe, devour the townspeople, and fuck while bathed in their blood.\u201d</p><p>A smile replaced the worried scowl on Taren\u2019s face. His fingers curled around the woman\u2019s behind as he pulled her tighter against his pelvis. She let out a small moan of pleasure, and a flash of fangs peeked out from under Taren\u2019s lips.</p> <p>Unadulterated fury singed me from the inside out. These two were every bit of the monster as their lore depicted them as. To talk so casually about murder caused my stomach to coil with nausea. My mind swam in dark waters as I contemplated all the ways I could kill them first. A small voice in the back of my mind whispered, How are you any better than them? I shooshed the voice\u2014I was ten times better than these two. I would kill to protect my pack, and myself, and with their deaths countless innocent humans would be saved, too. These vampires weren\u2019t innocent and killed for money, not necessity.</p><p>When I looked back at the couple, they were now laying back on the bed. The woman\u2019s shirt was missing, and Taren was kissing a path down her stomach. Her mouth opened with a moan, twin fangs poking out.</p><p>I closed my eyes, wanting to be anywhere but in this hotel room. I did not want to witness these two having sex. Moans and hungry snarls filled my ears, and I clamped my eyes tighter shut, willing myself out of the vision. Only, it didn\u2019t work. I was still standing in the hotel room, still subjected to their cries of pleasure. I whirled around and fumbled with the door handle, but it wouldn\u2019t turn. I flipped the locks, thinking they must be switched, but no matter how many times I flipped them, the door still would not open.</p><p>I kept my back to the couple, bile rising to my throat when the bed started creaking. None of my visions had ever lasted this long. I never felt trapped in the past, or worried about escaping it. I was now. My heart raced in my chest while my mind grappled with what to do. I didn\u2019t know how my visions worked, but surely this part wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>I moved to the corner by the door and rested my forehead against the wall like a child being punished. That\u2019s what it felt like\u2014punishment. I kept my eyes closed and hummed a song to drown out the endless moaning, squeaking, and flesh against flesh sounds. I kept thinking that at any minute I would be back on the mountain and all of this would be over, but after what seemed like hours, my feet were still firmly planted on the hotel\u2019s aging carpet.</p><p>The sounds stopped finally, and I stopped humming, listening for something other than the sounds of sex. A shuffle of clothes and footsteps caused me to turn around. Taren sat on the edge of the bed again in only a pair of jeans. His bare chest revealed a large tattoo on his back. I walked away from the door so that I could study the design. It seemed it was just a tribal design with no rhyme or reason. My lip curled up at the welts from fingernails, which lined parts of his back. The floral comforter and sheets were in disarray, and twin puncture wounds dotted the side of Taren\u2019s shoulder. I thought about how these creatures had to drink blood to survive and the bile in my throat rose again. Then again, I ate raw, bloody meat while in wolf form. Still, it seemed different in my mind, even if just slightly.</p><p>A cell phone on the bedside table rang out through the room. Taren lifted the phone and pressed it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah? She\u2019s in the shower ... She\u2019s not going to like that ... Tell Veronica yourself ... Tough shit.\u201d He pressed the end button on the phone and set it back on the table. Lowering himself, he lay on the bed and raked his fingers through his unruly hair as his eyes stared up at the ceiling.</p> <p>\u201cWhite wolf, white wolf,\u201d Taren whispered, his eyes still on the ceiling. \u201cBetter than the rest of tooth and claw. Rise above, take control, it is your destiny to rule them all.\u201d When he finished the rhyme, his head lolled to the side, and his eyes found mine. I gasped, going still except for the rapid beating of my heart.</p><p>The room began closing in on itself, white mist filtering in to cloud the space. My blonde hair flew around my face as my body began to move backward. It felt as though I was being sucked through a tunnel. The vacuum drew me back, and everything vanished. I squeezed my eyes shut and landed with a hard thump on my knees. Opening my eyes, I stared at the rough mountain ground with blurry eyes. I was panting, trying to catch my breath and slow the slamming of my heart. I fell back on my heels and threw my head back, closing my eyes again. I was nauseous and the spinning landscape wasn\u2019t helping. Tiny specks of cold dotted my cheeks and forehead. Wind whipped around me, blanketing me in its icy chill.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I made it just in time for the snow,\u201d I mumbled to myself.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open, and I swiveled my head toward the owner of the voice. What was he doing here? Anthony stood just to my left, eight feet or so away. He wore faded blue jeans and a long sleeved green henley. His blond hair was brushed away from his light green eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I said, putting a voice to my thoughts.</p><p>Anthony made no move toward me. Instead, he held up his hands in surrender and watched me with clear interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you holding?\u201d He nodded toward my hands.</p><p>I looked down to find them still curled into fists. Panicked, I stretched out my fingers and rubbed my palms against each other to rid myself of the vampire ash. Standing, I backed away from the small pile as if it was a huge pile of wolfsbane. I noticed the pile was smaller than before, having disintegrated while I had my vision. The small flecks of pieces I brushed off my hands swirled with the snowflakes, disappearing from view as the daylight ate them up.</p><p>\u201cI heard you had visions,\u201d Anthony said, coming closer, \u201cbut to see it while it\u2019s happening ...\u201d</p><p>My eyes cut to his and anger, disgust, and confusion swirled within me like the snowstorm surrounding me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, and why are you here? Did you follow me?\u201d I didn\u2019t hide the annoyance in my voice. I was still keyed up from the vision and the rhyme I\u2019d heard Taren recite. Did it mean something, or did he just make it up? I wasn\u2019t even sure if he was dead or not. Sure it\u2019d been his blood I connected with, but was he just injured last night or killed? If he was alive, maybe I could track him down and ask him. I thought about the hotel room I\u2019d been in. They had to be staying in town, and there were only a couple hotels. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to find them, though it would be dangerous. They were here to kill me, after all. My death meant a hefty paycheck, and if I showed up at their door, it\u2019d be like serving myself up on a silver platter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI spoke to my father,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cHe said you were searching for answers. I figured this was the best place to do that.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him cautiously. \u201cSo why are you here?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but think of his confession last night, though I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to think that I could be connected to Anthony, other than being engaged to his brother. Being linked to him, because of my Chante bond with Adam only tainted it. The mark on my palm was proof that I was supposed to be with Adam. It wasn\u2019t right that Anthony felt something because of it, because of his twin connection with his brother. It was like he was an intruder, stealing something special from me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you about last night,\u201d Anthony said in a soft voice. He looked away as thought nervous or shy. I wasn\u2019t falling for it. I knew better.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d Not only was I annoyed that Anthony was here; I was annoyed that he wanted to have a conversation I didn\u2019t. I wanted to concentrate on the information I\u2019d learned from the vision, not have a heart to heart with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a bitch,\u201d Anthony snapped, bringing his eyes back to mine. \u201cDo you think I want this ... that I want to have feelings for yet another one of my brother\u2019s women?\u201d He ran both hands through his hair and spun on his heel, turning his back toward me. I know I shouldn\u2019t, but a pang of guilt settled deep in my belly. When I learned the story of how Eve was promised to Adam, even though Anthony loved her, I felt sorry for him. It couldn\u2019t be easy loving a woman who was mated to your brother. Even though Eve and Anthony still hooked up from time to time, Eve was never fully Anthony\u2019s. My breath caught in my throat as a thought occurred to me. Was Anthony saying he had those types of feelings for me?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean when you say feelings?\u201d God, I could not deal with this atop everything else. I turned my left hand over and scowled at the brand marking my skin. My life had become increasingly difficult since the damn thing appeared on my palm. Adam\u2019s life was now linked to mine, people wanted to kill me because of it, and now my mate\u2019s brother was admitting that he felt something for me. I stared up at the gloomy sky and raised my middle finger to whoever was up there toying with my life. I did not find it as funny as they probably did.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Anthony admitted, turning to face me. \u201cAll I know is there\u2019s something about you, Anna. I felt it that day Eve attacked you and again when we kidnapped you. Every time she smacked you, an icy fury consumed me as though I was angry that she was hurting you. I don\u2019t know what it means, but it\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead from the sudden pain ricocheting through my skull. I snorted to myself. Adam assumed Anthony was here for me, but we both thought it was to kill me as payback for Adam killing Eve. His confession left me blindsided. If there was ever a time I was truly surprised, this would be it.</p> <p>\u201cI love Adam,\u201d I told him. I held up my left hand to show my ring and said, \u201cI\u2019m marrying him. I\u2019m sure whatever it is you feel\u2014it\u2019s some sort of weird twin bond you have with Adam. It\u2019s his feelings you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Anthony said with a serious expression. \u201cI tried staying away\u2014really I did\u2014but it felt like a piece was missing. I came here to see if it was you causing it.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a heavy breath though my nose. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Anthony hesitated to answer, which meant I wouldn\u2019t like what he had to say. I studied his face, so much like Adam\u2019s it hurt to look at him. They were the same height, had the same build, even the same lips. Anthony\u2019s eyes were a light green where Adam\u2019s were blue, and Anthony\u2019s hair was a tad longer since Adam cut his a couple weeks ago. It pained me to be repulsed by this man, but also find him attractive. It just wouldn\u2019t make sense to find Adam handsome and not Anthony. Their looks were where their similarities ended though; Adam was honorable where Anthony was a rebel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel it anymore,\u201d Anthony finally said. \u201cThe moment I saw you, it went away.\u201d</p><p>I wiped a snowflake that had landed on my eyelashes and hugged my arms to my chest. Cold had nothing to do with the motion. I felt exposed as his eyes burned into mine, willing me to admit I felt something, too. It pained me, seriously pained me, to not be able to give him what he wanted. I knew what kind of person Anthony was, but he was also flesh and blood, capable of real emotions, and he had already fallen in love with a woman he couldn\u2019t have. I did not want to be number two. Though I didn\u2019t understand Anthony\u2019s past actions, I couldn\u2019t help myself for feeling sorry for him. I wanted to hate him, to scream at him and even hurt him so he would give up this silly idea of feeling something for me, but I couldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t make my lips utter harsh words just to sway him from thinking what he thought.</p> <p>My parents always told me that words have more power than any weapon. With a lash of your tongue, you could bring someone to his or her knees, and they were right. How many harsh words had I heard in my lifetime that still stuck with me? How many times had I dissected what someone said and watched as my insecurities grew from those words? Life is all about rising above the ugliness that plagues us all. I didn\u2019t want to be that ugliness that Anthony might look back on like I did with those who were mean to me. I didn\u2019t owe him anything, but I owed it to myself to not become a person who allowed insecurities and negativity to rule my tongue. Being negative is easy; it\u2019s being positive that\u2019s difficult. Though I was angry, anxious, and worried, I swallowed those feelings and thought before I spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d I said. \u201cThis whole Chante bond is new to me, but I do know that my feelings lay with Adam. From the moment I saw him I just ... knew.\u201d I hoped he interpreted my words for what they were. I didn\u2019t have romantic feelings for anyone other than Adam.</p><p>\u201cAnd that day on the mountain when I stopped Eve from killing you, did you feel something when you looked at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter? I\u2019m with Adam, and we\u2019re bonded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a moment, recalling the day I was attacked by Eve. \u201cI thought you were beautiful,\u201d I admitted, looking at the ground. I felt like I was cheating on Adam just by telling Anthony that. I felt sick to my stomach and couldn\u2019t meet Anthony\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Footsteps drew my attention away from the snow-covered ground. Anthony moved toward me, his eyes alight with an emotion I didn\u2019t want to label. As he reached a hand out to me, a low, menacing growl filled the space, and an ebony wolf charged toward Anthony.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p> <p>A high-pitched screech left my lips when Adam barreled into Anthony. Anthony went down, Adam on his chest. I ran over to the pair and gripped Adam\u2019s inky black fur in both hands to help keep those sharp teeth away from Anthony\u2019s jugular.</p><p>\u201cAdam ... Adam he wasn\u2019t going to do anything. We were just talking,\u201d I yelled. Adam continued to snarl and snap at his brother while I tugged on his fur. Anthony\u2019s hands extended up to his shoulders to hold him off. With a hard push, Anthony shoved Adam off him long enough to transform into his silver wolf.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I mumbled. This was not good. I felt like I was standing on the sidelines of a hairy UFC fight. Adam charged Anthony, and Anthony charged at the same moment. They crashed into each other in a tangle of claws, teeth, and growls. In no way was I going to get in the middle of that, unless it went a step too far.</p><p>My breathing became labored as Adam\u2019s fury slammed into me. Adrenaline raced through my veins, amplifying my worry. My eyes traveled from one wolf to another, unsure who was winning. I raked my fingers through my hair with nervous indecision. I knew better than to interfere with fighting wolves, but I also couldn\u2019t stand to just watch them tear each other apart. What really ticked me off was that they were fighting over nothing. Did Adam really trust me so little to think I would cheat on him, especially with his brother? A small ball of hurt settled in my chest at the thought. Then again, hadn\u2019t I gotten jealous over Chloe? This love thing was a tricky, tricky bitch. No wonder I stayed away from it for so long.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I yelled, coating my words with as much authority as I could. I didn\u2019t expect it to work, but I needed to voice my inner thoughts.</p><p>Slowly, Adam and Anthony backed away from each other, walking backward, but keeping their eyes locked on one another. My forehead creased in surprise. They had actually listened. When I was sure they weren\u2019t going to attack each other again, I walked with caution toward Adam. Kneeling, I ran my fingers through his silky fur and leaned my forehead against the bridge of his wide nose.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened,\u201d I whispered, meeting his yellow eyes. \u201cNo one can threaten what I feel for you. Do you hear me? No. One.\u201d</p><p>Adam had been staring over my shoulder at his brother, but his eyes flicked to mine. He opened his mouth and then snapped it shut, huffing.</p><p>\u201cI never took you for the jealous type,\u201d Anthony said behind me. \u201cYou sure as hell didn\u2019t care that I was fucking Eve.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn around because I knew he would be naked and me seeing his nudity would only add fuel to the fire. Though, to be honest, I had already seen him naked that day on the mountain. Adam didn\u2019t need to know that, though. While nudity in the pack wasn\u2019t a big deal, I was sure Adam didn\u2019t want me to see that side of his brother.</p><p>\u201cIgnore him,\u201d I whispered to Adam. \u201cPlease, just let this go.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s body shimmered for all of three seconds before he was crouching on the ground in human form again. He lifted his head to me, his eyes a storm of different emotions. Adam stood and held a hand out to me to join him. He pulled me to my feet and, without warning, kissed me. This kiss was not soft or innocent; it was hard, passionate, and possessive. His tongue slipped between my lips and caressed my own while his lips ravished mine with severity. When his hand snaked around my waist and landed on my behind, a small moan rumbled up my throat. I couldn\u2019t help it; I could feel his excitement pressing against my leg. I didn\u2019t care that we had an audience, or that he may be pissed at me, and this was his caveman way of staking his claim. My wolf surfaced and devoured the pleasurable sensations he elicited, ready to feel his erection buried deep inside of us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The kiss ended sooner than I liked. One moment Adam\u2019s lips were fierce against mine, and then they were gone. My lips felt swollen and lacking without his mouth against mine.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about one thing, brother,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI didn\u2019t care that you fucked Eve because she was a heartless bitch. Make one move toward Anna, and I\u2019ll have your dick in my trophy case.\u201d Adam moved my hair to the side and kissed up the length of my neck, his eyes locked on his brother. \u201cGo ahead and fantasize about fucking her, but know those moans falling from her soft lips will always be for me. She is mine, and I\u2019ll kill any motherfucker who tries to take her from me\u2014be it blood or not.\u201d</p><p>Anthony snorted and ignored his brother\u2019s threats. \u201cYou don\u2019t own her, and that fancy brand on your hand doesn\u2019t only pertain to you, brother.\u201d</p> <p>Adam stood up straight, his body going as rigid as the mountains surrounding us. His lips straightened into a hard line, and a deep growl traveled up his throat. My muscles tensed around my bones, ready to snap from the tension.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true, Adam,\u201d I said desperately. It couldn\u2019t be true. I didn\u2019t feel anything for Anthony other than irritation and disgust. How could a bond only work one way?</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d Adam said sternly.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Anthony said, his voice holding smugness. \u201cIf you want to get technical, I saw her first. I came across her on the mountain. I stopped Eve from killing her. I felt the connection long before you ever did, brother.\u201d Anthony paused, and I cringed when I heard his footsteps drawing closer. \u201cI have to wonder, if it was me who slept with her first, would that brand be on my palm instead of yours? Is your bond all a matter of opportunity rather than fate?\u201d</p><p>I stopped breathing. Anthony was taunting Adam openly, goading him into another fight. Did he really think he could beat his brother? That small, annoying voice in the back of my mind wondered if he could. They were both from the same bloodline, had the same strength and power. I knew Adam was undefeated, but I didn\u2019t know Anthony\u2019s history. The vision of me finding Adam\u2019s dying body popped into my head. I had assumed the vampires were the ones responsible for his death, but maybe it was the man standing behind me.</p> <p>Adam was so quiet, so still. I looked up at him while my mind fought for the right words to say. Anthony had succeeded in planting doubt in his mind. I could see his mind working through all that his brother said, wondering if there was truth to any of it. Was what we had so easily debatable? I wasn\u2019t sure if I was more angry or hurt by the doubt racing through his sapphire eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you believe him,\u201d I said, reaching a hand up to guide his face down to mine. \u201cHe wins. He wants you to doubt us\u2014to believe that the only reason we\u2019re together is because you got to me first. It\u2019s not true, Adam. None of it. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Adam blinked as though seeing me for the first time. The storm in his eyes calmed, and the muscles in his face softened. It took me a moment to realize that was the first time I had actually said those three little words to him. I knew from the start that I loved him, but had always been hesitant to say it. This time those words just slipped out on their own accord, no overthinking required.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d Adam whispered.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI love you, Adam. I will always love you.\u201d</p><p>A grin spread across his face, and his eyes flashed to his brother. \u201cYou always were a sore loser, brother. I don\u2019t give a shit if there is any kernel of truth to what you say; the only thing that matters is I got to Anna first. You\u2019re too late.\u201d Adam smiled smugly, wrapping and arm around my shoulders and drawing me into his chest.</p> <p>Elle and I decided to sit in my bedroom and eat dinner. I needed to tell her about my vision, and I couldn\u2019t have wandering ears listening in. We sat cross-legged on the floor with our plates in front of us. I was just about to go into detail when my bedroom door opened and there stood Wade and Adam.</p><p>\u201cHaving a slumber party?\u201d Wade said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I said, \u201ccomplete with pillow fights and scary movies.\u201d</p><p>My eyes slid from Wade\u2019s face to Adam\u2019s. He had been quiet all day, only speaking when spoken to. I knew he was thinking about what his brother said, and that bothered me. Sure, I had thought about it, too, but I didn\u2019t spend more than ten minutes at a time. It was curious and that\u2019s it. I believed it didn\u2019t affect what Adam and I had, and no matter what Anthony said, I knew Adam and I were together because we were supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wade asked seriously. \u201cAvoiding your guests?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cSort of, but not because I\u2019m antisocial. I had a vision while on the mountain today. I was going to tell Eve about in hopes she could help me figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Wade\u2019s eyes went to my best friend and then back to me. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think to tell me about it? Isn\u2019t that the reason I\u2019m here, to help you develop your sight?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI thought you were here for a pretty brunette with hazel eyes?\u201d</p> <p>Wade snorted. \u201cThat too, but you\u2019re priority at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, \u201cCome in and shut the door. I don\u2019t want anyone else hearing this. I still don\u2019t know whom I can and can\u2019t trust.</p><p>Wade filtered into the bedroom, Adam behind him. Wade sat on the floor, his back resting against my dresser. He drew his knees up and rested his arms on them. Adam sat on the edge of the bed, his arms resting on his knees while he stared at the carpeted floor. I proceeded to tell them every detail about the vision, down to the horrid porno to which I was subjected. Elle catcalled and asked for details and frowned when I told her I turned my back during that part.</p><p>\u201cPrude,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for not wanting to see two vampires, hell-bent on killing me, going at it.\u201d</p><p>I told them about the phone call and how I thought the main vampire chick\u2019s name was Veronica, but I wasn\u2019t positive.</p><p>When I stopped talking, Elle asked, \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my eyes taking a trip around my bedroom to meet their eyes. I was almost embarrassed to recite the rhyme Taren had. What if it was nothing? What if he just made it up to be clever, and by reciting it, my friends and fianc\u00e9 would think I was being egotistical.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Wade asked.</p><p>With a deep breath, I said, \u201cWhite wolf, white wolf, better than the rest of tooth and claw. Rise above, take control, it is your destiny to rule them all.\u201d I had been reciting those words in my head all day in hopes of not forgetting them. \u201cWhat do you think it means?\u201d</p><p>You heard one of the vampires say this?\u201d Elle asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cTaren said it, and when he was done, he looked right at the spot I was standing. It was creepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Elle said.</p><p>\u201cThen the vision ended.\u201d</p><p>The room grew quiet and Elle, Wade, and Adam all took turns looking at each other, avoiding my eyes entirely. There couldn\u2019t be any truth to it, there just ... couldn\u2019t be. I didn\u2019t feel special or capable of ruling them all, whoever they were.</p><p>\u201cSomebody say something,\u201d I finally said.</p><p>\u201cOur kind has many legends surrounding them, as do most supernatural beings,\u201d Wade began. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed or not, but white wolves are not common, so when one pops up, people assume they\u2019re the white wolf, the one tied to the legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the rhyme Taren spoke is true?\u201d</p><p>Wade\u2019s head fell to the side as his shoulders bobbed up and down. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Yes, that rhyme is an old wolf legend, but no one knows if it\u2019s just a nursery rhyme or a prophecy. There has never been a white wolf rise to that position, so it\u2019s just been a story passed down through the generations. How a vampire knew it is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI think whomever hired them to kill me must have told him. What if ...\u201d I thought for a moment. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re not here to kill me for being bonded to Adam, but because someone thinks I\u2019m the white wolf from the rhyme? Maybe someone is worried I\u2019ll take his or her place in power.\u201d I glanced at Adam and then away. His parents were of olde blood, very powerful. They were the only ones I could think of that would benefit from my death. Not only would I not be bonded to their son anymore, but they also wouldn\u2019t have to worry about me supposedly rising to power.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are vindictive and snobby, but they wouldn\u2019t kill one of their own kind,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNot without a threat.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a sad smile. \u201cWhat if they think I am a threat? They could believe I am the white wolf from the poem and want to kill me before the prophecy can happen.\u201d I reached a hand up and placed it on his leg. \u201cJust for the record, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m that wolf, but superstitions have caused people to kill in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a point,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAnd just for the record ... you could be that wolf.\u201d His eyes found mine, and a small shiver skipped up my spine.</p><p>\u201cThen it stands to reason,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThat the Leaders could be behind this. They also stand to lose their places of power if Anna was that wolf. Last time I checked, you\u2019re one of them, Wade.\u201d</p><p>Wade responded with a deep growl, which Adam reciprocated. Men.</p><p>\u201cGrowling at each other isn\u2019t going to figure anything out,\u201d Elle said. \u201cHow many innocents have died because the finger was pointed at them in a state of panic?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and nodded at her. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Salem Witch Trials? Look how many innocent men and women died because the Puritans believed they were witches. The only way to be absolutely sure is to investigate and figure out who hired the vampires.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled over my bedroom, our plates forgotten in the center of us. I hadn\u2019t eaten more than two bites before Adam and Wade interrupted our secret meeting, and now the thought of food unsettled my stomach.</p><p>\u201cHave you gotten anything off Anthony?\u201d Wade asked, causing Adam to snort in derision. I ignored the anger that was surely on his face and shook my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really touched him to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two looked pretty chummy in the mountains,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Wade looked at Elle. Elle looked at me, and I looked at Adam. A flurry of emotions ranging from embarrassment, hurt, and anger roiled in my stomach. He was acting like a jealous teenager instead of the confident alpha I once thought he was. Like I said, love is a tricky, tricky bitch. It can turn grown men into children and women insecure, but all relationships went through times like these, right? I had no clue. I had never dated anyone longer than two weeks. I always chose to leave before things got serious and messy.</p> <p>\u201cCan I speak to you ... alone?\u201d I directed the question at Adam. It took Wade and Elle all of two seconds to stand and head toward the door. Elle gave me a compassionate look before she and Wade left my room.</p><p>\u201cThat was an asshole thing to say in front of them, Adam. You make it sound like you found me cheating on you.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t respond, which only pissed me off more. He just sat on the bed\u2014his hands clasped in front of him, staring at the floor. I wanted to scream and punch a wall or wolf out. I did none of those things. Instead, I stood up and crossed my arms. If he wanted to play the silent game then that was fine by me, but he wasn\u2019t leaving my bedroom until he apologized. At this point, I would even settle for a look of apology, just something that told me he regretted making me look like a cheater in front of my friends. I knew as soon as he was away from me, Elle would find me and ask me what he meant by that comment. The fewer people who knew about Anthony\u2019s strange connection through our Chante bond the better. Now was not the time for people to question my loyalty to Adam.</p><p>\u201cIt pisses me off,\u201d Adam finally said, still staring at the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty pissed off, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, lifting his head to meet my eyes. \u201cIt pisses me off to think of you with anyone other than me. I see the way men look at you, Anna. I see the hunger in their eyes and know what it means, and it makes me see red. I want to rip their dicks off just for looking at you.\u201d He took a ragged breath and studied the carpet again. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this amount of possessiveness before. If I could, I would whisk you away, and we would live by ourselves in the middle of nowhere. I know how crazy I sound, and that\u2019s why I have done my best to keep a lid on my jealousy, but seeing you with him\u2014seeing him reach for you as though he had done it a million times before and had a right to\u2014I wanted to kill him. I would have had you not stopped me.\u201d He met my eyes again, and my stomach plummeted to my feet. A tiny sliver of fear coursed through me before I reminded myself that this was Adam and not some controlling boyfriend. Adam would never do anything to hurt me. I knew that.</p><p>I took a deep breath before I spoke, hoping my voice didn\u2019t sound as shaky as I felt. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to trust Anthony, Adam, but you do have to trust me. You should know that whether I\u2019m surrounded by a million GQ models or not, I\u2019m always thinking of you. This relationship is not going to work if we don\u2019t trust each other. Had you waited just a couple seconds longer before charging Anthony, you would have seen me bat his hand away. I know what it must have looked like, but you know what they say about assuming things. And you made me look like an ass with your comment. Now Wade and Elle probably think I\u2019m in some twisted love triangle with you and your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019ll explain to them, and just so you know, I know you would never betray me like that. It\u2019s just ... the thought of men wanting what is mine drives me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t,\u201d I said, forcing a smile. \u201cIf you know for sure I would never do anything with any of them, then you should be proud\u2014even a little smug\u2014that you have something they could never have. I can\u2019t do this whole jealous fianc\u00e9 thing.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes snapped to mine. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. I saw how jealous you got whenever I talked to Chloe.\u201d</p><p>Just the mention of her name caused me to scowl.</p> <p>\u201cSee, that look right there,\u201d Adam said, pointing toward my face. \u201cJealousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d I said. \u201cChloe actually thinks she should be your mate. Other than Anthony, no men have come on to me. Speaking of that, what is this I hear about a line of mates you have?\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged as though I had just asked him about a collection of hats or shoes rather than a line of willing females ready to take my place. I glared at him for making me feel like shit when he was the one with the suspicious females in waiting.</p><p>\u201cAll alphas have a list of acceptable female mates should something happen to our current ones. It sets a good example for an alpha male to have an alpha female.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThat sounds ridiculous.\u201d I now knew why his mother was so against our pairing, not that my mutt-ness wasn\u2019t the number one reason, but also because I wasn\u2019t on the list of acceptable mates. I was sure Mommie Dearest had handpicked them all. It reminded me of some eighteenth century marriage agreement. Not an ounce of romance or love required, just good genes and a powerful family name.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our way, Anna,\u201d Adam said. \u201cOr at least it was. I obviously didn\u2019t follow protocol when Eve died. Yeah, Chloe should have filled her spot, but I love you. You\u2019re the one I want by my side. I lived through a loveless relationship once; I wasn\u2019t going to do it again.\u201d</p><p>A million thoughts raced through my head, all of which would only cause another fight. The loudest thought screaming in my mind was whether Adam would have picked me had we not bonded. Had I not given into him the night before I was supposed to be killed by the Leaders, would Adam have chosen me over Chloe? None of those insecure thoughts voiced themselves, though. Instead, the most unimportant of them all did.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought Chloe was gay? That\u2019s what Elle said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s bi,\u201d Adam said in explanation.</p><p>\u201cWell, that clears that up.\u201d I turned to leave, but Adam reached out and grabbed my arm to stop me. I kept my back to him, my inner voice loud as it repeated the important question in my head. I was too afraid to ask, because nothing good ever came from asking yourself the \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions. We were together, and that was all that mattered, right?</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I saw you,\u201d Adam said, \u201ceven before we slept together, and the Chante mark appeared, I wanted you, Anna. You were mine from the moment you set foot on my mountain, and I will always be yours. No list or politics will change that.\u201d</p><p>I turned and shook my head to keep the tears in my eyes from falling. \u201cHow is it you always know exactly what to say?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled, tugging me toward him. He wrapped his arms around my waist and hugged me tightly to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s easy when it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>I was not cut out to be a spy.</p><p>Elle, Wade, Adam, and I headed down the cracked walkway of the motel ready to introduce the vampires to a little sunlight. After describing who we were looking for to the chubby guy in the office, he had directed us to Room 16. Now, Elle and Wade stood on the left side while Adam and I took the right. It only took half an hour of arguing with Adam for him to give in and let me come with. What he didn\u2019t know was I didn\u2019t need his permission. I was coming along whether he wanted me there or not, but entertaining his idea that he had some control over the situation seemed to make him happy enough.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Wade sent the message to all of us, his voice filling my head. Adam nodded and I did, too, not that my readiness mattered. Adam made it clear that while I was going, I would not be fighting with the vampires should it come to that. Again, it was cute he thought he could tell me what to do.</p><p>Wade stepped out in front of the door and, in one swift move, brought his leg up and slammed it toward the door, kicking it in. The flimsy door caved in on itself. Pieces flew into the room while other small pieces hung from rusty hinges. Moving quickly, Wade entered the room with Adam right behind him. Elle followed Adam, and of course, I was the last to enter. That had been the designated order they agreed on when we were driving into town. I sat in the backseat, rolling my eyes and ignoring their plans to keep me out of harm\u2019s way. It was sweet, but annoying. The best way to prove you can hang with the big dogs is to prove yourself. I planned to do just that.</p><p>I stared into the room. It had the same matching twin beds and ugly carpet as the room from my vision, but the room was empty.</p><p>\u201cThey knew we were coming,\u201d I said, and three heads turned to look at me. \u201cTaren received a phone call shortly before my vision ended. Whatever the person told him on the other end, it didn\u2019t sound like good news. I wonder ...\u201d I pursed my lips in thought, trying to remember exactly what Taren\u2019s responses had been.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elle said. \u201cYou wonder what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whoever hired them must know I can see into the past. I wonder if the person on the phone called to warn them about my power. They would have to know that after the fight the other night, I would want to find out answers, and there was vampire blood all over. Seeing someone\u2019s past is easier when I have some of their DNA.\u201d When I was trying to figure out what Eve was up to, Wade had cleaned hair from her brush and made me hold onto it in hopes of it helping me connect with her, and it had helped a lot.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Adam said under his breath. \u201cHow are we going to find them now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThey\u2019re vampires and it\u2019s daytime. They have to be somewhere that would protect them from the sun. I say we knock on every single door of every single hotel in Buffalo. If they\u2019re not hiding out at a hotel, then we start checking empty houses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to take forever,\u201d Elle said. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Anna just interrogate all the wolves? It\u2019s your right, as the hostess of the conference, to question the wolves on your mountain, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Wade smiled. \u201cAnd you have a Leader there to enforce your ruling. They cannot defy my judgment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, but my parents can,\u201d Adam said softly. \u201cIf, and that\u2019s a big if, they\u2019re responsible, they\u2019re not going to let Anna read them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would only make them look guiltier,\u201d I said. \u201cIf all the other wolves go through the questioning and they don\u2019t, won\u2019t that raise more than a few questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we can steal hair from their brushes,\u201d I said with a smile toward Wade. It had worked once, so why not try it again?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, torturing vampires sounded like more fun,\u201d Adam said with a devilish smirk. Wade and Elle nodded their heads in agreement. What a bunch of deranged weirdoes.</p><p>\u201cI still say we at least check this motel out,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThey might have just moved to a different room.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cAs if we\u2019re that lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we due for some luck?\u201d Elle said with a grimace.</p><p>It was true; things hadn\u2019t exactly been peachy on the mountain. I tried to ignore that it had been since I arrived, but maybe things started going haywire before I showed up, or maybe that was wishful thinking.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, \u201cbut maybe try knocking on the doors before kicking them in. I doubt the motel will be happy to learn all their doors need to be replaced.</p><p>Wade smiled. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d With a wink of his eye, we moved on to the next room. He raised his leg, ready to land a blow when I arched an eyebrow at him. Slowly, his leg lowered, and his arm rose. He rapped on the dingy door and raised both his eyebrows at me as if to say, \u201chappy?\u201d I pursed my lips and rolled my eyes, hugging my arms to my chest.</p><p>Adam\u2019s arm slunk around my shoulders as he held me tightly against his warm body. I looked up at him and gave a small smile. Things were still tense between us, but also good. A relationship that\u2019s perfect all the time is either fake or not as happy as the people want those around them to think. I could handle a few arguments with Adam if it meant we would bounce back, and we would.</p><p>A middle-aged man with wiry brown hair answered the door. He was wearing a pair of dress pants and a button down shirt, the first few buttons undone. His tie hung around his neck, and just behind him, a woman holding covers to her chest watched us with uncertainty. I held my hand to my mouth as a snort traveled up my throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wonder why I\u2019m cautious about relationships,\u201d I whispered to Adam. It wasn\u2019t a secret that seedy\u2014rundown motels such as this one were a cheater\u2019s paradise.</p><p>Adam leaned down so that his mouth brushed my ear. His warm breath sent a tingle tiptoeing down my spine. \u201cIf he had woman like you, he wouldn\u2019t even think about cheating.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and nudged his side with my elbow. Adam rubbed the spot, pretending I had hurt him and chuckled.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the man said, eyeing the four of us with caution. He was smart to be wary of us\u2014what with Wade with his shaved head, leather coat, and scowl, and Adam with his impressive height and build. Not only that, humans could tell there was something off about us. They just didn\u2019t know what; their minds wouldn\u2019t let them believe we were monsters.</p><p>\u201cSorry to\u2014\u201d Elle began, tilting her head to look at the female, \u201cinterrupt, but we\u2019re looking for a man and a woman. She has shoulder- length brown hair, pale skin and the man has longish brown hair and pale skin. You haven\u2019t seen them by any chance, have you?\u201d</p><p>A wrinkle appeared between the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo, we just...uh got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Wade said with a smirk. \u201cLunch break rendezvous? A little afternoon delight, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Red colored the man\u2019s face in anger, his eyes thinning into slits while the woman\u2019s face reddened out of embarrassment. When he opened his mouth to say something, Wade held up his hand and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care,\u201d he said, and headed toward the next door. The three of us followed him and I caught a glimpse of the woman before the man slammed the door. Her head was down, her face slack.</p><p>That could have been you. My inner voice said. I slid a glance at Adam but his eyes were on the next door. In the beginning Adam offered himself to me, but he was still mated to Eve. Had I given in, I would have become his mistress. I\u2019d fought tooth and nail from lowering myself to that, but I had to wonder if Eve was still alive and Adam and I weren\u2019t bonded, would I have eventually given in?</p> <p>I shook the thought away. I knew the reason I finally gave in to Adam was because we were each other\u2019s other halves. We had been drawn toward each other from the first moment we laid eyes on each other. Had we not been chantes, there was no way I would have become the other woman. I knew that just as sure as I knew we were not going to find the vampires are this motel.</p><p>So, I was right, and we didn\u2019t find the vampires, but we found evidence of their presence in the form of two dead bodies. By the time we made it to Room 12 the stench of death was so strong, Wade didn\u2019t bother with knocking. He kicked the door down only for us to find a man and a woman sprawled on the bed with two puncture wounds in their neck and wrists. With all of their blood gone, their complexions resembled a grayish, waxy hue. Their wide dead eyes stared up as though caught in the last moments of their death. Blood dotted the blankets and carpet like macabre confetti, and one of the women\u2019s hands still clutched the sheets.</p><p>\u201cVampires aren\u2019t normally this stupid,\u201d Wade said, walking around the bed to inspect the dead bodies.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey kill to eat, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t need to kill to eat,\u201d Adam answered. \u201cA few sips here and there will sustain them. What Wade means is that vampires don\u2019t leave bodies with traces of vampire attacks out in the open for humans to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a message,\u201d I said. \u201cThey knew we were coming, knew we would find these two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Wade said, \u201cbut we already knew they wanted to kill you. What\u2019s killing two humans and leaving them for us supposed to convey that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting me to explain vampire motives? Let\u2019s just agree that they\u2019re insane, and nothing they do makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Wade rested his arms on either side of the dead woman\u2019s body and leaned down. In a swooping motion, he sniffed from her stomach all the way up to her matted blond hair. My lip curled up in disgust when he closed his eyes and remained poised over the woman. I glanced over my shoulder to make sure no one walked by and saw the four of us in a room with two dead people, much less Wade sniffing one of them.</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2014uh\u2014leave before someone thinks we did this,\u201d I said.</p><p>Wade ignored me and said, \u201cI would guess them to be dead for almost a day.\u201d</p><p>A thought occurred to me then. \u201cThe vision I had was right before the vampires appeared on our mountain last night. Maybe they picked up these two after the fight to feed off of and heal themselves.\u201d I might have been reaching, but I didn\u2019t want these two humans to be dead because the vampires were trying to send some cryptic message.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Elle said, hugging her arms to her chest as she stared at the lifeless bodies. \u201cOur best bet is finding who hired them. We find the employer, and we can find the vampires,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cThat means spending all night reading the wolves,\u201d I said with a grimace. Of course I wanted to find the person responsible, but my visions were not guaranteed. I was still a little confused as to why it sometimes worked and sometimes didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cElle\u2019s right,\u201d Wade said, standing up. He withdrew his cell phone and began scrolling through his contacts list. \u201cAnna, see if you can get a read on these two. I have to call someone to clean this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already know the vampires killed them,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy do I need to read them?\u201d Truth was, I wasn\u2019t thrilled about touching a dead body\u2014let alone two.</p><p>Wade held his phone at his side and took a deep breath. \u201cBecause, you know as well as I do that visions tell more than who\u2019s guilty. Maybe the vampires said something that will clue us into who is behind their being here.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed around the disgust and nodded. He was right, and finding answers was more important than my discomfort. I walked around the bed, the backs of my knees hitting the opposite mattress. With uneasy steps, I moved closer to the dead couple. They didn\u2019t look older than their mid-twenties. As I looked upon them, I wondered if they had families, and a pang of hurt filled my chest. They would never know that these two died from a vicious vampire attack. I wasn\u2019t sure how clean up worked in these situations. Would their families assume they were just missing, left to wonder where they were or what had happened, or did the clean-up crew have a witch or vampire on their payroll that could alter a human\u2019s mind?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Elle asked.</p><p>I looked up at her and noticed her eyes shifted from me to the broken down door. Time was definitely of the essence in this case. I reached a hand out and clasped the woman\u2019s wrist. Flakes of dried blood gathered around the puncture wounds. I ignored how cold she felt, as well as the bile rising in my throat.</p><p>Within seconds, the present slipped away, and I was standing in the motel room from the past. The man and woman sat like zombies on the bed, their legs dangling over the edge. The vampire woman crawled onto the bed and drew the woman\u2019s hair to the side to expose her throat. I stood so that I was facing the horrendous show head on.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re watching, white wolf,\u201d the vampire said, surprising me. \u201cTheir blood is on your paws.\u201d And then she sunk her fangs into the woman\u2019s throat. The woman didn\u2019t scream or even flinch as the fangs drove into her flesh. A lone tear was the only sign that she was feeling anything. I watched it slip down her cheek until it splashed on her clasped hands.</p><p>The female vampire withdrew her fangs, her mouth slick with a fresh coat of blood. She closed her eyes and let out a moan that sounded sexual. I cringed, backing up until my back hit the wall. Whatever reservations I might have had about being a werewolf, it could have been worse. I could have become one of these monsters. All in all, sprouting fur and paws was like winning the lottery in comparison. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe will leave a trail of bodies in our wake until you turn yourself in, Anna,\u201d the vampire said. Her words sounded muffled as she spoke around the two large ivory daggers extending from her gums. When she struck the woman\u2019s neck again, this time harder, I yelped. Taren joined in on the feat, lifting the woman\u2019s wrist and burying his fangs in the soft skin there. Two more tears dripped from the woman\u2019s eyes, falling soundlessly against her pale cheeks while her eyes stared forward.</p><p>The worst part about having visions was that I couldn\u2019t do anything. As much as I wanted to help the two humans, I couldn\u2019t. They were already dead, and I was only here as a spectator, witnessing their savage deaths\u2014helpless. No, not completely helpless; I could help these two by tracking down the monsters and running a stake through their hearts.</p><p>A soft whooshing of air was my signal that the vision was ending. I kept my eyes locked on the two vampires and their feast, allowing all of the emotions I was feeling to surface.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d I whispered the promise, not that the vampires could hear me.</p><p>I blinked, and I was back in the present. Same motel room, except the two humans were now dead, and the vampires were gone. Nausea swam through my stomach, and I curled my lips inward to keep from vomiting. It didn\u2019t help though; I could feel it rising in my throat. I turned and ran toward the small bathroom, making it just in time to puke into the dingy toilet. I wasn\u2019t sure if the vision caused the sickness, or I was just disgusted by what I saw. Either way, I hugged the cool porcelain until I expelled everything in my stomach.</p><p>A warm hand rubbed my back while another drew my hair away from my face. I knew it was Adam, but I couldn\u2019t acknowledge him while on the verge of spewing again. Just having him there, trying to comfort me, helped settle my unease.</p><p>When I sure I wouldn\u2019t throw up anymore, I stood, turned on the faucet, and cupped my hands underneath to take a drink.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anything useful?\u201d Wade asked.</p> <p>A rumble reverberated up Adam\u2019s throat. \u201cShe\u2019s sick,\u201d he growled. \u201cGive her some time before you start interrogating her.\u201d</p><p>I splashed water on my face and curled my fingers around the sink\u2019s edge. Looking up, I found three pairs of eyes watching me through the mirror. My thoughts volleyed between keeping the information to myself and telling them. In the end, I decided telling them the truth was for the best.</p><p>\u201cThey plan to keep killing until I turn myself into them,\u201d I said. \u201cThey knew I might be watching and made sure to say that so I knew the repercussions.\u201d I hung my head and closed my eyes as the last waves of nausea left my body. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it,\u201d I added.</p><p>The room was quiet for a couple moments until Elle spoke up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do what?\u201d</p><p>I looked up again, meeting her eyes in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m going to turn myself over to them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike hell you are,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cAnna, don\u2019t be stupid,\u201d Elle added.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they want you to do,\u201d Wade said.</p><p>I gave a humorless laugh, knowing this is what telling them the truth would get me. It\u2019s not like I expected them to be like, \u201cYeah, we think that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>I turned to face them. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop, and I can\u2019t let any more innocents die on my account. The quickest way to end all of this is to kill them, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d I pushed past the three of them, gave one last look to the dead couple on the bed, and left the room.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk about this,\u201d Adam said as we got out of Wade\u2019s SUV. A large group of werewolves were clustered around the yard. In our absence, Joe and Asher had made sure the wolfy games continued.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about,\u201d I said, pushing through the crowd. As I passed bodies, I realized everyone was looking at me, some with amusement, others with worry or pity. What the heck is going on?</p> <p>Adam curled his fingers around my bicep to stop me. I knew this wasn\u2019t easy, his heart was in the right place, but the vampires wanted me\u2014not him. I kept seeing the dead humans\u2019 eyes staring lifelessly. I knew if I didn\u2019t give myself up, those wouldn\u2019t be the last dead eyes I saw.</p><p>\u201cAnna Avery,\u201d a female voice boomed through the crowd.</p><p>Adam stopped trying to talk to me, and all the surrounding wolves grew quiet. The crowd parted as Chloe walked toward me, a smirk on her face. Her eyes were bright with an elation I didn\u2019t understand. When she stopped in front of me, she placed on hand on her cocked hip and smiled wide at me. My eyes wandered to the surrounding faces, and again I saw looks of anxiousness.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\u201d I asked, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d Adam said, his voice hard. \u201cNow is not the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think now is the perfect time,\u201d Chloe said. Looking at me, she said, \u201cAnna Avery, I challenge you.\u201d</p><p>Gasps rang out around the yard, while some people cheered. It took me a moment to understand what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou want to ... fight me ... for Adam?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help the breathy laugh leaving my lips. My mind went through stages of shock, disbelief, and then understanding. Chloe was really challenging me to fight, and knowing her, it would be to the death. I stared at her with wide eyes, waiting for her to say it was a joke. Unfortunately, wolves did not joke about fights or politics. The gleam in her eye made sense now; she already expected to win, expected to get Adam. The emotion that hit me in that moment was indescribable, something akin to rage but much, much stronger. I had never been more pissed than I was right that minute.</p><p>\u201cNot for Adam,\u201d Chloe said, \u201cto claim my rightful spot.\u201d Her eyes trailed over Adam, and my body literally shook with my anger. \u201cThough, he\u2019s not a bad prize either.\u201d</p><p>Adam stepped in front of me, his hands fisted at his sides. \u201cYou touch her, and I\u2019ll kill you. I don\u2019t care what clan you\u2019re from. I\u2019ll go to war with your family before I\u2019ll let you challenge my Chante.\u201d</p><p>A body pressed against my right side, but I couldn\u2019t look anywhere but at Chloe. My wolf was just beneath the surface, ready to maul her and turn her creamy skin into pretty ribbons of flesh.</p><p>Chloe rolled her eyes at Adam\u2019s threat. \u201cYou know very well you cannot interfere with an official challenge, Everwood, no matter who your family is.\u201d Her eyes slid to me, a devious glint reflecting in her eyes. \u201cWhat does it feel like to know your mate doesn\u2019t even think you can defeat me?\u201d she said to me.</p><p>I rushed forward, ready to tear her apart. Strong arms banded around my waist and held me back. I kicked and thrashed against my captor\u2019s arms, screaming for them to let me go. What really drove my fury over the edge was when Chloe threw her head back and laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get your chance,\u201d a man said against my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t let her make you look like a fool.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but those words helped calm me down. I stopped fighting and sagged against the arms holding me for a moment before standing on my own and looking up at the person holding me. My mouth opened in surprise as I realized I was in Anthony\u2019s arms.</p><p>I smacked his hands. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d He obliged, but not before rubbing a small path against my stomach. I cringed and stepped away from him and toward Adam. I caught Sawyer\u2019s eyes in the crowd. His face was white as his eyes zeroed in on my face. I moved my gaze to other faces, and they all looked the same. Everyone already assumed Chloe would beat me, and that pissed me off more. Okay, so maybe I was a young werewolf, and she was from a respectable clan, but a little bit of assurance would have been nice.</p><p>\u201cIf you go through with this,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI will step down as the alpha of Everwood. Females cannot be alphas of their own pack. What will you do then, Chloe?\u201d</p><p>Chloe blew out a breath and pursed her lips. \u201cIf you\u2019re the type of man who could abandon his pack, then I wouldn\u2019t want you as a mate anyway. I\u2019m sure there are more than a few willing fellas here that would take your spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pledge myself to you,\u201d Elle said, stepping forward.</p><p>\u201cMe either,\u201d Joe added.</p><p>\u201cOr me,\u201d Sawyer said, making his way through the crowd.</p><p>This went on until almost every wolf in our pack vowed not to pledge himself or herself to Chloe. Out of twenty-five wolves, only five did not speak up. I didn\u2019t hold their silence against them. From what I heard, changing packs was scary.</p><p>\u201cIf a challenge is won, the winner owns the loser\u2019s pack.\u201d We turned our heads to see Maggie Everwood stepping through the crowd. Today, she wore a sage green pantsuit, and her blond hair was pinned up in its usual spot. \u201cWhile it\u2019s nice you all love and respect Adam and ... Anna,\u201d she said, coating my name with the disgust she felt for me. \u201cYou cannot deny a new alpha. That is our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou\u2019ve stooped pretty low, but I never thought you would do this,\u201d he said to his mother.</p><p>Her eyes moved back and forth, a sign she was embarrassed her son had talked back to her. \u201cAdam, I only want what\u2019s best for you, and this ... mutt ... is not it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you spout off what\u2019s best for me,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou thought Eve was best for me, and she ended up killing innocent humans. Had it not been for us, she would have revealed our secret to the humans. I think it\u2019s safe to say, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for me.\u201d</p><p>Maggie\u2019s lips thinned, and her eyes squinted. \u201cYou will not talk to me like that. I will not argue over that wretched woman.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if she was talking about Eve or me. When her eyes flicked to me I got my answer.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said loud enough so my voice would carry. I stepped in front of Adam so that I was only a couple feet away from Chloe and Maggie. I fisted my hands and took a couple deep breaths, eyeing Chloe with derision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI accept,\u201d I said, lifting my chin.</p><p>More gasps and sounds of surprise echoed through the crowd. Chloe laughed as though she couldn\u2019t hold in her excitement any longer. She wouldn\u2019t be laughing for long.</p><p>\u201cI swear you have a death wish,\u201d Elle said. \u201cFirst, you almost hand yourself over to the Leaders when they accuse you of Eve\u2019s murders. Then, you jumped out of my car to go fight Eve. Just an hour ago you said you were going to give yourself to the vampires, and now this?\u201d She worked her long red hair into a sloppy ponytail as she paced the kitchen floor. When she stopped, she placed her hands on her hips and stared at me.</p> <p>\u201cDo you realize what you just agreed to, Anna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinning you for the allotted time is not going to satisfy her, Anna. She\u2019s not going to stop until your heart does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, you don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Adam said. He sat at the table with me, along with Wade and Sawyer. No matter whose face I met, their eyes showed the same thing\u2014worry. I didn\u2019t know what was worse, being challenged, or no one having any faith in me.</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d I said, not for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cI can have her killed in a half an hour,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI know people. No Chloe, no challenge.\u201d He shrugged as though he was discussing the weather instead of having someone murdered. Even if that someone was Chloe.</p><p>I propped my elbows on the table and rested my head in my hands. Closing my eyes, I tried to drown out their constant babbling about how stupid I was, or the many ways I could get out of the challenge. Right before I exploded on them, a voice saved me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys.\u201d I lifted my head to find Anthony leaning against the doorframe. He shook his head as his eyes circled around the room.</p><p>\u201cInstead of encouraging, Anna, you\u2019re all scaring the hell out of her. You all treat her like a helpless child instead of the brave woman she is. When Adam was shot at the ceremony, it was Anna who leapt from the stage to hunt the attacker down, and when the vampires attacked in the forest, it was Anna who saved Wade.\u201d Anthony snorted and walked farther into the room. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t all flapping your gums, you\u2019d see just how freaked out and pissed Anna really is. She doesn\u2019t need you all breathing down her back.\u201d He paused for a moment, meeting Adam\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf she were any other wolf in your pack, you would not belittle her. You would be lifting her up with words of encouragement, getting her pumped for the fight. Did you ever stop to think how embarrassing it might be for Anna not to have your support, brother?\u201d His eyes met mine, and for a few lingering moments we just stared at each other.</p><p>\u201cYou have my support,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI have no doubt you\u2019re going to kill that bitch.\u201d</p><p>Despite how tense the room was, I smiled. It felt good to have someone in my corner, even if that someone was Anthony Everwood.</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t belittling her,\u201d Adam said, standing up and blocking Anthony\u2019s view of me. \u201cWe just care about her and don\u2019t want anything to happen. We are looking out for her.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and slammed my hands on the table so loud, the wolves in the living room stood up on alert.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not made out of glass, Adam. I don\u2019t need you protecting me all the time, and Anthony is right, it was embarrassing when you stood up for me out there. The last thing I need is for everyone to know how little you believe in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I held up my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said and moved around the table. I stopped by the door and turned to face my friends. \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, guys.\u201d Then I left through the front door. I didn\u2019t know where I was going, but I couldn\u2019t be in that house for another minute, around all those concerned eyes.</p><p>I headed down the dirt drive, no destination in mind. I had been walking for fifteen minutes when I heard footsteps behind me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to talk, Ad\u2014\u201d I spun on my heel and swallowed my words when I saw Anthony walking toward me. I grimaced, hating the smile on his face, but most of all, I hated that his presence didn\u2019t elicit my normal response I had for him. You never knew who was going to stand in your corner until your back was to the wall. I sure as hell didn\u2019t expect Anthony to come to my rescue.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I turned back around and started walking again. Anthony walked beside me, keeping a good two feet away from me. I thought that was strange, but decided not to comment on it.</p> <p>\u201cAdam made it pretty clear I should leave the house,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I did.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is what he meant.\u201d</p><p>Anthony smiled down at me. \u201cThen he should be clearer next time.\u201d He punctuated the sentence with a wink.</p><p>We walked a long time in silence. I always loved nighttime in the mountains. The inky blackness of the sky was so dark the stars resembled diamonds. It was peaceful with the sounds of the surrounding animals scurrying through the forest. A soft breeze blew through the tree limbs, rattling leaves. I focused on the crunching of our footsteps, instead of the awkwardness growing between Anthony and me. When had things become awkward between us? Before, his presence annoyed me, but now ... now, I was hyperaware that he was right next to me.</p><p>\u201cI should head back,\u201d I said more to myself than to Anthony. When I spun around, Anthony gripped my wrist to stop me. When I looked at his fingers and then up at him, he released me.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying, you know. I do believe you can take down Chloe.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath and nodded. \u201cThanks for that.\u201d</p><p>Anthony studied me for a long moment. So much so, that I almost started to fidget under his gaze. What was wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cI know what it feels like,\u201d he said, \u201cfor no one to believe in you. My family always labeled me the screw up of the family. After a while, they just stopped noticing me altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they meant anything by it,\u201d I said. \u201cAdam is just really overprotective, and Elle is my best friend. They don\u2019t want anything to happen to me.\u201d</p><p>Anthony tipped his head to the side. \u201cIf you believe that, then why were you so upset?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my answer dangling on my lips. With a serious look, I rolled my tongue over my lips and sucked in a breath through my nose.</p><p>\u201cI do believe that. It just ... gets old after a while. I thought after Adam pledged himself to me, he would start seeing me as an equal, but...\u201d</p><p>Anthony snorted. \u201cAdam has white-knight syndrome. It\u2019s only one of his disgusting qualities I hate.\u201d</p><p>Anger rose in me. \u201cJust because he wants to protect those he loves is not disgusting. It\u2019s brave that he puts himself in harm\u2019s way for others. I bet you\u2019d never do that.\u201d His words that night he confessed to wanting to protect me flitted through my mind, but I decided not to bring that up. Things in my life were complicated enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do it for you,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cJust not to the degree he does. I don\u2019t know how he doesn\u2019t see that spark in you. I see it every time I look at you. You\u2019re just as brave as he is. Having a female like that ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you liked Eve?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause she was tough?\u201d</p><p>Anthony\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t always like that, and no, that\u2019s not why I liked her.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but I felt guilty for asking him about his dead girlfriend. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>Silence settled between us again. We stood in the middle of the road, avoiding each other\u2019s eyes. At the whooshing of air, I looked up just in time to see another arrow sailing through the air toward me.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Anthony shoved me out of the way, and I landed with a hard thump on my behind. The arrow made a thwacking sound as it buried itself in a tree. I pulled myself to my feet, my eyes scanning the forest in front of me.</p><p>\u201cCome out, come out, wherever you are, bloodsuckers,\u201d I cooed.</p><p>Anthony gave me a look that said he thought I was losing it, and maybe I was. How much drama could one girl live through?</p><p>\u201cGo back to the house and tell them I surrendered to the vamps,\u201d I told Anthony.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlly, olly oxen free. I surrender,\u201d I called out to the darkness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna, what are you doing? You\u2019re not going with them.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, bringing my eyes back to Anthony. \u201cWho\u2019s being protective now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being protective,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m being smart. You don\u2019t just walk off with a bunch of vampires.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know about my earlier vision and that innocent lives were in my hands until the vampires got what they wanted. The woman from my vision, and the other night, stepped out of the forest. She had a crossbow aimed at me as two more vampires stepped out behind her.</p><p>\u201cGet our message, did you?\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d I said. \u201cA simple email or phone call would have sufficed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always thought visual displays were more effective,\u201d she said with a shrug. Her eyes darted from me to Anthony, and then to the forest behind us. \u201cOnly you two then?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and quirked an eyebrow at her. \u201cSince I\u2019m surrendering and all, maybe you could tell me who hired you. It\u2019s obviously someone who knows what I can do, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave me that macabre message.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHow about this, I\u2019ll tell you when I\u2019m burying a silver knife in your heart.\u201d</p><p>I noticed Anthony bristle next to me, but I kept my face wiped of all emotion. A thought occurred to me then, and I smiled. The vampire\u2019s head wrinkled as she looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t know how my power works. I\u2019ll know the answer as soon as I touch you, and then all I have to do is send a telepathic message back to my pack and your boss ... history. No boss, no paycheck, Veronica.\u201d Okay, so maybe I was fibbing a little. My visions didn\u2019t work that easily or clearly. I hadn\u2019t been sure her name was Veronica until I spoke it. Her eyes widened in surprise at her name rolling off my tongue. I hope that it was proof enough that I could get whatever information I wanted from my sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Taren,\u201d I said to the man standing beside her. His eyes widened just like Veronica\u2019s had. She looked at him and then back at me, indecision all over her pretty face. A smirk bent my lips as I watched them frazzled.</p><p>Veronica steeled her features and stepped forward. I held up my hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m serious. Without that paycheck, how will you take that trip to Europe?\u201d Her steps faltered, and her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about Europe?\u201d Taren asked.</p> <p>I grinned\u2014giddy I was making them second-guess themselves. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept who hired us,\u201d Veronica said with a satisfied smile.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cExcept that, but I plan on finding out soon.\u201d</p><p>We considered each other for a moment, silence settling over us like a veil. I watched Taren and Veronica and they watched Anthony and me.</p><p>\u201cSmart.\u201d Anthony\u2019s voice filled my head.</p> <p>Veronica looked at Taren as though they were having a telepathic conversation. Hell, maybe they were. I didn\u2019t know what vampires could or could not do. When she turned back to me, a smile lifted her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou want to know who hired us?\u201d When I nodded, she took a step closer. \u201cLook to your right.\u201d</p><p>My earlier giddiness faded into the pit of my stomach. I slowly lifted my head to look at Anthony.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re lying,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>I wanted to believe him, but the look on his face looked angrier than shocked. If he were innocent, wouldn\u2019t he have looked surprised or something? I took a step away from him, eyeing the vampires and Anthony.</p><p>\u201cYou lying sons of bitches,\u201d Anthony snarled before he jumped for them. As he jumped into the air he transformed into his wolf and landed on the vampire to Veronica\u2019s left. They went down in a ball of fur and snarls.</p> <p>Something blurred in front of my vision. I blinked and found Veronica standing right in front of me. Before I could get my mind working again, her fist sailed through the air, and all I felt were knuckles against my cheek before darkness consumed me.</p><p>I came to some time later, or at least I was guessing it was later. Wherever I was, it was dark. I couldn\u2019t be sure what time it was. I shifted my body and groaned when a hard throb pulsated through my head. This wasn\u2019t just a headache; it felt as though an earthquake had erupted inside my skull. Squeezing my eyes shut, I winced as I waited for the pain to subside. When I tried to rub my temples, I noticed my hands were held together by what felt like a zip tie. I wiggled my legs, and sure enough, my ankles were bound, too. After a few minutes of deep breaths, I calmed myself down and the pain inside my skull receded to a dull ache. Something hard pressed into my back, and the place smelled like musty earth. Leaning to the side, I moved my hands against the ground only to find it was made up of dirt.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I channeled my wolf. My vision automatically became clearer, and I could make out the features of the room. I took in the rock walls and lifted my eyes to the ceiling that was carved out of rock, too. I was in a cave, probably in the mountains somewhere. I studied the space more and saw shadowed heaps to the left and farther back in the cave. I sucked in a deep breath, and along with the earthy smell was staleness\u2014vampires. If they were sleeping, it must be daytime. I could use that to my advantage, but first, I needed to try and get a message to Adam.</p><p>I concentrated on his face and thought, Adam? Can you hear me?</p><p>I waited a few moments but was answered with silence. Ignoring the pain in my head, I tried again. Adam, please say you can hear me. I tugged against the zip ties on my wrists. I wasn\u2019t sure why the vampires thought plastic strips could hold a werewolf, but I was happy for their mistake. The plastic gave way, snapping and falling off my wrist. Rustling sounded where the vampires slept. I stilled, my eyes going to their bodies. When I was sure they were still sleeping, I bent over to pull on the zip tie around my ankles. With relief, I stood and began moving in the direction I hoped was the exit. There weren\u2019t a lot of deep caves in Wyoming, so the odds were in my favor.</p><p>After a few steps, I stopped and turned toward the vampires. If I left, this would all start back over again. I needed to kill them and end this. As much as I knew that, the thought of tearing these monsters apart with my teeth unsettled me. Then I thought about the vision of Adam dying, and it was all the motivation I needed. My feet began moving in their direction, my wolf ready at the surface. It would be easy with them asleep. I could rip their throats out before they even stirred. Or that\u2019s what I thought.</p><p>I stood at their feet, eyeing their still bodies in the dark. There were only four: Veronica, Taren, and two others I didn\u2019t recognize. I was just about to change when Adam\u2019s voice penetrated my mind.</p><p>\u201cAnna, can you hear me?\u201d</p> <p>I chuckled to myself, either out of relief, or because we were starting to sound like a cell phone commercial. Can you hear me now?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m in a cave ... somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Adam released a relieved breath. \u201cI thought ... It\u2019s been almost twenty-four hours since I last heard from Anthony.\u201d</p><p>I crinkled my brows. \u201cAnthony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sent a message that the vampires arrived and that you had surrendered to them. When we reached the spot where he said you guys were it was empty. I haven\u2019t heard from you or him since, and I thought ...\u201d</p><p>I frowned, confused. So while I was talking to the vampires last night, Anthony had been sending a message back to the pack. So much for the vote of confidence. Then I remembered what the Veronica had said, that Anthony hired them.</p><p>\u201cIs Anthony with you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he with you?\u201d Adam replied. \u201cWe figured you were both with the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, just me,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re sleeping right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, get out of there. I\u2019ll send hunting parties out to find you.\u201d</p><p>I eyed the sleeping vampires. \u201cI have to end this, Adam. They won\u2019t stop otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d I could tell Adam was trying very hard to keep his cool. Though his voice sounded calm, I could hear the anger hiding beneath it. \u201cJust because they\u2019re sleeping, doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t wake up. Vampires can be up during the day; they just can\u2019t step into it. Just get out of there, and together we\u2019ll go back and take care of them.\u201d</p><p>I debated on what to do. It would be smarter to escape and then lead the others back to the cave, but what if the vampires moved again? Their still bodies temped me, taunted my wolf to sink her teeth into their pale flesh. I could almost feel her begging within me to be released.</p><p>\u201cIf you find Anthony,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t let him get away. The vampires admitted that he was their boss. I will see you soon.\u201d</p><p>I wished telepathy worked like a cell phone and that when you were done talking, you could simply hang up. It wasn\u2019t like that at all. I might have been done discussing my course of action, but Adam wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAnna, do not attack them. You cannot take on multiple vampires.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him and began stripping my clothes. I would need them undamaged after I changed back to my human self. Adam\u2019s worry slammed into me like a bumblebee trapped under glass. It hit in my chest as though trying to convince my mind I did not want to do what I was thinking about doing. I faltered for a moment, my fingers lingering on the hem of my capris.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cI won\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m leaving and will send you a message as soon as I know where I am.\u201d</p><p>The anxious worry subsided, and I could think clearly again. I hated lying to Adam, but I couldn\u2019t think with his voice and emotions in my head. If I second-guessed myself while in the middle of attacking four vampires, I would definitely end up dead.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Adam said. \u201cJust get back to me, Chante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I sent them message and prayed those words wouldn\u2019t make me out to be more of a liar.</p><p>Once undressed, I knelt down on my hands and knees and turned my mind over to my wolf. I could feel her elation at being released. A whoosh of energy washed over my bare skin, sending goose bumps pebbling over my body, and then I was on four paws. It amazed me at how quickly my transformations happened now. In the beginning, they had been painful and took almost five full minutes.</p><p>My wolf shook her fur out as though she was shaking the last bits of me off her. Slowly, she padded around the bodies until she stood beside one of the vampires we didn\u2019t know. It was a man with short black hair and a five o\u2019clock shadow. He slept with his arms bent behind his head, oblivious that sharp teeth hovered just inches from his throat. My wolf opened her mouth and lowered it closer to the vampire\u2019s throat. As I thought about her ripping his throat out, a sense of excitement raced through my body. It was poetic justice that a man who had spent his life drinking from the necks of humans was going to die from getting his ripped out.</p><p>My wolf didn\u2019t wait any longer. She clasped the man\u2019s throat between her sharp canine teeth and squeezed. The man\u2019s eyes snapped open wide as his hands clawed at her snowy fur. With just a little more pressure, the man\u2019s esophagus crushed in on itself. Blood coated my wolf\u2019s tongue, but the taste was bitter compared to the richness of animals. When the man stopped flailing, she paused and listened for any sign that her kill had disturbed the sleep of the others. When she was happy that it hadn\u2019t, she clasped the man\u2019s arm in her teeth and dragged him away from the others. With soft footsteps, she moved to the next, a woman with short red hair and a spray of freckles across her creamy skin. She didn\u2019t hesitate this time. She struck the woman\u2019s throat in one crushing blow. The woman didn\u2019t have enough time to struggle or cry out.</p><p>Two down, I thought, two more to go.</p><p>I should have figured Veronica and Taren wouldn\u2019t be as easy as the first two. Veronica shot up, her eyes wild and fangs out. She raised her nose in the air and inhaled, her eyes shooting toward the two dead bodies at her feet. Of course they would have smelled the blood from my wolf\u2019s kills. I should have killed them first. A feral snarl fell from her lips. Taren popped up behind her, his features just as wild. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a blur of motion, Veronica rushed me. As my wolf, I could track her a little better, but still not one hundred percent. She looked as though she was made out of an angry cyclone, hurdling toward me while a spray of dust particles whipped up in her wake. Kicking her leg out, she landed a blow to my side, and I flew across the cave where I bounced like a stuffed animal off the hard rocky wall. The pain was instant, but my anger allowed me to ignore it as best as I could. My wolf got to her feet, lip curling over sharp canines, and charged. I slammed into Veronica\u2019s body, and together we fell to the dirt floor. I snapped toward her neck, looking for my opening, but Veronica\u2019s hands blocked her throat. My teeth buried in her palm until I scraped against bone. A sharp hiss broke through her lips and she flung me off her. I flipped over her head, landing on my side, but quickly found my footing. With vampires, I had to be fast. Taren moved toward me, but Veronica held out her arm toward him.</p><p>\u201cThis bitch is mine,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>If I could smile as my wolf, I would have. I was thinking the same thing, I thought. My eyes flicked to Taren to make sure he listened to Veronica. He stood off to the side, his body as ridged as the stone surrounding us. I was confident I could kill both of them individually, but together ... well, let\u2019s just say I was happy Veronica\u2019s pride got in the way.</p> <p>She circled around me, and I moved with her, never taking my eyes from hers. I noticed in the darkness of the cave, they reflected like an animal\u2019s. The wound on her hand was quickly healing. I couldn\u2019t get the upper hand if she healed this quickly from every injury I inflicted. My next blow needed to count. Power unlike anything I had ever felt before brushed over my fur, leaving a tingling sensation crawling against my skin. Every emotion I was feeling intensified and left me shaky: anger, disgust, fear, and even excitement. They all flooded me until I felt like my skin would rip from my bones. Footsteps sounded behind me, and I threw a quick look over my shoulder to find Taren inching closer. Whatever he saw in my face caused him to stop. His eyes widened, and he held up his hands in surrender, inching further into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cVeronica,\u201d he said in a calm voice as though he was trying not to scare a wild animal. \u201cLet\u2019s just go. Leave her.\u201d</p><p>I swung my gaze back to Veronica and tilted my head to the side. The same shocked expression showed on her face in the form of wide eyes and parted lips. As I stared at her, thoughts that weren\u2019t my own filled my head.</p><p>Who are you to stand against me? I am the ruler of tooth and claw. I will shred your flesh from your bones and lap your blood in victory.</p><p>Whoa. Where the hell had that come from? The sudden overtaking of thoughts momentarily dazed me. Was that my wolf? My focus came back when Veronica charged toward me, her eyes alight and bloodthirsty. I feigned left, and when her arms reached in that direction, I whirled around and sunk my teeth into her forearm. Her screams reverberated off the cavern walls, music to my ears. With a sharp tug, her arm popped out of its socket, and I flung it to the floor. She collapsed to her knees, her arm going to her bleeding shoulder. My wolf sauntered toward her, enraged and drunk on the power coursing through our veins. The closer I got, Veronica tried to use her good arm to fend me off. Her fingers arched into claws as she swung them through the air at me. I could feel my wolf chuckling at her feeble attempts.</p> <p>You thought you could overpower me? ME? I heard the voice again, laced with anger and empowerment. You threaten my life, my Chante\u2019s? Disgusting parasite.</p><p>With the speed of the wind, my wolf lunged, landing on top of Veronica\u2019s screaming body. With one arm, she couldn\u2019t hold back the weight of my wolf. I saw the defeat in her eyes right before she let her arm fall to the floor, and I sunk my teeth into her jugular. With a jerk of my head, Veronica\u2019s screams cut off. My wolf spat out the chunk of flesh and began scanning the cave for Taren. Somehow, we knew he was gone. He had left Veronica behind, knowing if he didn\u2019t, he would pay with his life, too.</p><p>Smart, for a bloodsucker, the voice said.</p><p>Who ... are you? I thought and then immediately wondered if I was having a conversation with myself. Adam had told me that my wolf and I were not two separate entities after all. He told me that we were one, and I just hadn\u2019t connected with my animal side yet. Was I connecting with it now? Was this how all werewolves felt while they unleashed their beasts?</p><p>I am she. I am you, the beast replied. You and I have been destined since the day of your birth. You are destined for greatness\u2014for power yet to be seen\u2014as the ruler of tooth and claw, a Leader to rule them all. Now is the time for embracing your wolf, dear Anna.</p><p>Wha\u2014I don\u2019t understand, I sent the thought to the voice, still feeling slightly crazy for having a conversation with myself. I don\u2019t want to rule them all.</p> <p>A soft chuckle floated through my mind. You will ... you will. That was the last thing my wolf said before I felt myself changing back. The power rushing over my skin subsided into a gentle throb as my human side emerged.</p><p>I knelt on all fours, hanging my head as I tried to catch my breath. Digging my fingernails into the dirt, I closed my eyes and fought off the waves of dizziness clouding my head. Something felt different, but I couldn\u2019t identify what it was. I wasn\u2019t even sure how I felt about it. Should I be frightened, excited? Indecision caused my mind to blank as the last effects of my wolf left my body.</p><p>I stood on wobbly legs, naked and sweaty. My eyes flicked to Veronica\u2019s dead body. Flaps of bloody skin hung from the hole where my wolf had ripped out her throat. My hand went to my stomach as nausea churned like an angry sea. I lurched forward and covered my mouth with my palm. As I continued staring at Veronica, I noticed the thick pool of blood soaking into the ground beneath her, and that\u2019s when I lost it. I turned, bending over and vomited until I got everything out.</p><p>When I was done being sick, a strange calm washed over me. I glanced at Veronica again and wiped the spittle from my mouth. No emotions occurred when I looked at her. My chest rose and fell heavily as a warming sensation climbed through my chest and settled in the spot over my heart. The oddest sense filled me. I wasn\u2019t sure, but it felt like entitlement and pride. Slowly, a smile crept onto my lips, and I headed toward the mouth of the cave.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>I walked up the long dirt drive that led to my house. The breeze played along my body, carrying away the heat from my skin. I raised my head and closed my eyes as the sun warmed my face. Birds chirped in the nearby trees and the scent of wild berries and honeysuckle filled my nostrils. I was blissfully happy, fulfilled.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to find Chelsea standing in the yard, gawking at me. I smiled and kept walking. I could feel eyes heavy on me, but I didn\u2019t stop to pay them any mind. There was only one pair of eyes I needed to see. Whispers and whistles sounded behind me and as I climbed the steps of the porch, the door swung open. Adam stared at me with surprise, his blue eyes tinged in yellow. My smile grew as I climbed the steps toward him, but when I reached him, he didn\u2019t greet me the way I wanted him to. Instead, he gripped both of my arms and held me away from him. I furrowed my brow, confused, and tried to push forward, but his grip was steel.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened, Anna?\u201d he asked, his voice steely.</p><p>I tilted my head to the side. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naked,\u201d he said, his eyes taking in my body. \u201cAnd ... what is that?\u201d He nodded toward my chest.</p><p>Looking down, I saw the angry red lines of a design positioned over my heart. Dried drips of blood caked my skin around the design. Looking at it upside down, I couldn\u2019t be sure what the mark was.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shoved forward again, needing to feel Adam\u2019s arms around me, but he still held me at arm\u2019s length. I glowered at him and slammed my arms down to break his hold.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Adam said with surprise. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? You\u2019re not acting like yourself. The last time I heard from you, you said you were leaving the cave. I thought ... I thought you were dead. I couldn\u2019t feel you, and you wouldn\u2019t respond to me, and now you show up naked with a strange mark and your eyes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my eyes?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bright orange, Anna. What happened in that cave, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>I huffed and shoved past him, heading into the house. As soon as I stepped foot into the living room, the wolves stopped moving. They stood still, their eyes widening as they watched me walk through the house. I walked through the kitchen, down the hall, and into the bathroom. When my eyes met my reflection, a smile was back on my face. My hair was longer, shinier, and streaked in white. My eyes were indeed orange and bright as though a light was shining from the inside out. I dropped my gaze to the mark over my heart. It still looked a bit messy with the dried blood so I grabbed a washcloth and held it under the faucet, bringing it up to clean it. I could feel Adam\u2019s presence before he shut the door and stepped behind me.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d he said in a softer voice. I met his eyes in the mirror. \u201cPlease tell me what is going on, Chante.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my eyes to the mark and continued washing away the blood. That other voice\u2014my wolf\u2014sounded in my head.</p><p>Your destiny awaits.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicked back up to Adam\u2019s. I tried to ignore the worry etched on his face and the ... fear in his eyes. It didn\u2019t matter, though; his emotions slammed into me as if they were my own. He was afraid, whether of me or for me was still unclear.</p><p>\u201cThe myth, it\u2019s true. I am the white wolf.\u201d I brought my eyes back to the mark, now clean of blood and dirt. It was a paw print with a crown hovering over the tips of the claws, but that wasn\u2019t what was odd. A reddish glow seemed to emanate from the tattoo. I trailed my fingertips over the design, and it was hot to the touch.</p><p>\u201cLeader of tooth and claw ...\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Adam breathed, backing away from me. He ran a hand over his face and sat on the side of the tub, resting his head in his hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you frightened?\u201d I asked, turning around. \u201cDo you not think I am deserving?\u201d A bit of anger laced the last part of my sentence.</p><p>He looked up, his face almost haggard looking. \u201cI can\u2019t feel you like before,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I feel is ... I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. It feels like emptiness.\u201d</p><p>A jolt of awareness shook me. \u201cWhat do you mean? You don\u2019t ... love me anymore?\u201d</p> <p>He gave me a sad smile. \u201cNo, Chante, I will always love you. I don\u2019t feel you. I can\u2019t sense what you\u2019re feeling or thinking. When I try, I just feel ... emptiness. How did this happen?\u201d He waved a hand toward me to signal my changes.</p><p>\u201cI killed Veronica and two others,\u201d I said. \u201cTaren got away, though.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose as his eyes expanded. \u201cThat\u2019s it, you killed three vampires and you turned into this?\u201d Again, he signaled toward me as though I was some freak in a carnival sideshow.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I snapped, \u201cis my destiny. It\u2019s what I was always supposed to be. My wolf told me so.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s face contorted into a mixture of surprise and confusion. \u201cYour wolf told you?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, turning toward the mirror again. I grabbed the brush and began running it through my hair. \u201cIt was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever felt before, Adam. When her voice first sounded in my head, it scared me, but I feel it now.\u201d</p><p>Adam stood and walked behind me. \u201cFeel what?\u201d</p><p>I met his eyes and smiled. \u201cPower. It\u2019s unbelievable, Adam. It courses through my veins like wildfire, intensifying everything: sounds, touches, scents. Make love to me, I want to feel you inside of me.\u201d I moved toward Adam, but he took a step away from me. That hurt more than I cared to admit. The energy racing through my body demanded that I get angry, but seeing Adam step away from me only made me feel sad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still me,\u201d I said. \u201cI am just more powerful now.\u201d</p><p>Adam released a breath through his mouth that sounded like an exasperated snort. \u201cDon\u2019t you even care that I\u2019ve been searching the mountain for caves all day, that some groups are still out there searching? Doesn\u2019t it bother you that I can\u2019t feel you anymore? How can you stand there and act like everything is okay? Nothing about this is okay, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy,\u201d I shouted, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not helpless anymore? Are you really so insecure that a powerful woman frightens you? This damsel is no longer in distress, Adam.\u201d</p> <p>Sadness consumed his features. His eyes softened, and his lips parted slightly. He began to reach an arm out to me, but dropped it before he touched me.</p><p>\u201cI never thought of you that way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have never been weak in my eyes, but this ... it\u2019s driving a wedge between us. What I don\u2019t like is that you don\u2019t seem to notice it.\u201d</p><p>Something splashed onto my cheek. I brought my fingertips up to find tears were falling from my eyes. This both confused and awakened me. With each teardrop that fell, I started to feel more like myself. It was like a veil had been covering my eyes and, ever so slowly, it was lifting. The rush of power was still strong, but not as overpowering as before. I blinked away the tears and felt that calming sensation wash through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still me,\u201d I said, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I was telling Adam or myself. I repeated those words in my head over and over.</p><p>I\u2019m still me. I\u2019m still me. I\u2019m still me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t undo what\u2019s been done,\u201d I continued. \u201cI have a purpose, and I can\u2019t shut my eyes to it, Adam, but,\u201d I stepped away from the sink and moved toward him. He didn\u2019t back away this time, and the butterflies swirling in my stomach did a happy dance. I wound my arms around his waist and rested my face against his chest. \u201cI will try to not let it pull me away from you.\u201d I looked up at him. \u201cI am still and always will be yours, until you no longer want me.\u201d</p><p>They will all want you. A voice remarked in my head. This time, I tried to ignore it instead of relish in the power behind its words.</p><p>\u201cThat will never happen,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe\u2019ll research this, and see if there\u2019s a way to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, stepping away from him. \u201cGet rid of it? If you love me, you will love every part of me. This is not something I can get rid of. I was meant to be this, the Leader of tooth and claw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeader of tooth and claw,\u201d Adam said with exasperation. \u201cWhat does that mean, that you\u2019re going to rule all the werewolves?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I do know that there is no cure for this.\u201d I signaled to myself as Adam had done. \u201cJust this once, be on my side. Support me and my new path.\u201d</p><p>Adam gave a humorless laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve always been on your side, but I will not let this ... mark ... change the Anna I know and love. You said you\u2019re still yourself, but it scares me how much you\u2019re not. You look like my Anna, but you don\u2019t feel like her.\u201d</p><p>We stared at each other wordlessly, the silence louder than any words spoken. My heart jumped in my chest beneath my new tattoo, and while I felt all-powerful and entitled, seeing how tormented Adam was caused all that empowerment to wane. My heart raced not out of anger, but heartache. An internal battled waged inside my head, one side screaming that I do whatever Adam wanted and find a way to fix this, and the other side resenting him for turning this monumental moment in my life into something bad. It didn\u2019t feel bad. It didn\u2019t even feel wrong. I wasn\u2019t drunk with the power or on a rampage to make all the wolves cower at my feet. Why couldn\u2019t he see that the transformation I\u2019d gone through as a good thing? Nobody would ever look at me and mutter that horrible four-letter word again\u2014mutt. I was no longer just a dirty blood or a made wolf; I had been chosen for a coveted spot in our rankings, a ruler among the children of the moon. As my mate, shouldn\u2019t he be proud of me?</p><p>\u201cI can leave,\u201d I finally said.</p><p>Adam snorted again and shook his head as though disgusted with me. The butterflies in my stomach dropped dead with his reaction.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cCould you really leave me so easily, walk away from all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stand to live with me, to love me as though everything is normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything isn\u2019t normal, Anna,\u201d Adam shouted. \u201cI want the old you back.\u201d</p><p>I was quiet for a moment while I gathered my thoughts. On my walk back to the house I had envisioned our reunion, and thought of all the ways we would kiss and embrace each other. Seeing his reaction now left me stunned and pissed. It didn\u2019t just hurt\u2014it crushed me.</p><p>I held up my left palm so that my Chante brand showed. \u201cThis is the only proof you need to realize that we\u2019re still meant for each other. No amount of wishing will bring the old me back. The past is meant to be behind us, not shared with our present or future. I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t get on board with this, with me.\u201d When he began to talk, I held up my hand to stop him. \u201cI\u2019ll leave, give you time to think.\u201d I didn\u2019t wait to see if he would stop me, I knew he wouldn\u2019t. I exited the bathroom and headed toward my bedroom to pack.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d Elle said, peeking her head into my room. \u201cOh, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Since leaving the bathroom, fifteen minutes ago, I\u2019d been a mess. I didn\u2019t feel all-powerful right now. I just kept picturing Adam\u2019s face and how he didn\u2019t reach for me as I told him I was leaving. Some badass ruler I was turning out to be. Then again, that overwhelming power I felt before was now just a dull throb beneath my skin. I felt more like myself now, than I had in a long time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, waving away Elle\u2019s concerns. When I turned to face her, her lips dropped open in an O.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not that bad,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cUh ... no,\u201d she stammered, \u201cThey\u2019re just bright ... orange. Like a neon marker.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to cheer me up, you\u2019re doing a lousy job.\u201d</p><p>Elle walked over to my bed and sat on the edge, bringing her knees up to rest on the bedrail. I shoved a wad of clothes into a duffel bag and walked back to my closet, hesitating just like I had been since I set foot in my room.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, give me the short version.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and hugged my arms to my chest. \u201cShort version? I killed Veronica and two other vampires, and then this happened. My wolf and I are not one thing, but two. She talks to me, and I learned that I\u2019m the white wolf from that twisted nursery rhyme. I even got a souvenir.\u201d I pulled down the hem of my shirt so the glowing tattoo showed. Elle hopped off my bed and walked over to me, her eyes gaping as she studied the mark.</p><p>\u201cAnd Adam doesn\u2019t like tattooed women?\u201d She raised one brow in question. I knew she was trying to lighten the mood, but I could not find humor in the situation.</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t like powerful women,\u201d I said. \u201cI guess, I don\u2019t know. He says I\u2019m different, that he can\u2019t feel me anymore. I can still feel him, though. For instance, right now his emotions are such a clusterfuck of anger and fear that I\u2019m choking on them.\u201d I blew out a breath, ruffling my hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just think he needs time to accept my changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething good came out it,\u201d Elle said. \u201cChloe withdrew her challenge on you as soon as word got around about your new ... self.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. I had actually been looking forward to taking that bitch down.</p><p>Elle eyed my duffel bag. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving the house?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I said, \u201cYeah, just for a little bit. I want to give him some space.\u201d</p><p>Elle ran her hands up and down my arms in a soothing motion, finally tugging me toward her in a hug. She ran a hand up my back, her fingers twining through my hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like the new highlights,\u201d she said, and I could feel her smile against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cThanks, another souvenir.\u201d</p><p>When I began to pull back, Elle held me in place. Her face was so close to mine that I could see the fleck of gold swimming in her green eyes.</p> <p>\u201cUh, Elle?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes dropped to my lips, and she licked hers in response. \u201cYou do feel different,\u201d she breathed. Then she did something that caught me by surprise. She leaned in and brought her lips to mine. She kissed me slowly, her lips nipping playfully at mine. It took me a second to realize this was not a friendly, best friend kiss\u2014if there were such a thing. This was an intimate kiss.</p><p>I gently pushed her away, turning my back to gather my thoughts. Lesbians and gays did not freak me out. I believed every single person had the right to love and desire whomever he or she wanted, but Elle was my friend. I just did not feel those types of feelings for her. In the five and half months that\u2019d I\u2019d known her, she had never even hinted that she thought of me like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered behind me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said just as softly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. I don\u2019t know what came over me. It\u2019s just ... I had the sudden feeling to make you feel better, and for some reason a kiss came to mind. I know you\u2019re strictly dickly, and I wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, really.\u201d I turned around. \u201cI mean, yeah it was strange, but don\u2019t beat yourself up about it.\u201d I smiled at her, hoping to ease the awkwardness. \u201cI never got to have the \u201clesbian experience so many college girls get, so thanks for that.\u201d</p><p>She laughed shakily. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome? Jeez, that was weird.\u201d Her eyes met mine before she looked away. \u201cI can feel my wolf trembling beneath my skin.\u201d</p><p>My forehead wrinkled. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head noncommittally. \u201cYou know how when a really powerful werewolf is near us, we tingle all over?\u201d When I nodded, she continued, \u201cIt\u2019s like that, but ten times stronger. Like my wolf side is in the presence of a god or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this what Adam\u2019s talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t mention anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d she said with a shiver. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of a badass now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I should smile or frown. The part of me from earlier was still elated with the new development, but I had seen what it cost me, and that made me want to scream in frustration. And now Elle was acting all funky around me.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d she said, not noticing my internal battle.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go on alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave the pack, they need you.\u201d</p> <p>She scoffed, sitting on the bed again. \u201cFor what, cooking? Chelsea can take over my kitchen duty until we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be thrilled about that,\u201d I said. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t spoken more than a handful of words since she moved in with us. I know she blames me for what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew her,\u201d Elle said. She grabbed the ends of her red hair and inspected it for split ends. \u201cThere are worse things than becoming a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYeah? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be dead.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>I continued packing, Elle leaving me to my thoughts. One of Adam\u2019s big t-shirts rested on the floor by my dresser. I picked it up and brought it to my nose, inhaling his scent. My eyes watered, but I refused to cry anymore. He had a choice, and if he chose to watch me walk away, there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. I would not grovel at his feet and beg him to understand the new me. I tossed his shirt into my bag and grabbed a few photographs off my dresser\u2014one of my parents and I when I graduated high school, and another of Adam and I, taken just a week ago. He stood behind me, his arms wrapped around my waist while I leaned against his chest. The sun highlighted our smiling faces. I silently yearned to be that blissfully happy again, but hadn\u2019t I told Adam the past was in the past? As much as I wanted him, I would never be the Anna he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou guys will work it out,\u201d Elle said.</p><p>I didn\u2019t turn around, but her words gave me what I needed most\u2014hope. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man is crazy about you, seriously. I doubt he\u2019ll even get through one night before he\u2019s pounding on whatever hotel we\u2019re staying in. You two will be back to devouring each other by tonight.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her over my shoulder, smiling through the pain. \u201cLet\u2019s hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually am.\u201d</p><p>Screaming and a loud bang sounded, and both Elle and I jumped and looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>It indeed was not good. Adam and Anthony were fighting on the front lawn. A fist swung through the air, a grunt following. I couldn\u2019t be sure whose arm it was. They were on the ground beating the crap out of each other.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, and the authority in my voice surprised even me. The surrounding wolves stopped whooping and hollering and stood still, their heads bowed. Adam and Anthony stopped pummeling each other, staggering to their feet. Anthony swiped a drip of blood from his fattening lip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Adam said, his tone snarky. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who told me he hired the vampires. Just apprehending a traitor.\u201d</p><p>I tried to ignore Adam\u2019s attitude, but it stung. \u201cBy beating the shit out of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to run,\u201d Adam said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Anthony said. His eyes finally found my face, and I got the same look from him as I did everyone else\u2014shock.</p><p>\u201cSo you willingly came here to turn yourself in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hire the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where were you?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe vampires took me, and Adam said you hadn\u2019t been back here. Running only makes you look guiltier.\u201d</p><p>Anthony spit blood onto the ground, and Adam grinned. No matter how old they were, they still acted like children around each other. I had to give props\u2014as much as I didn\u2019t want to\u2014to Maggie and Donald for raising these two.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t running,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cI was tracking ... you. The vampires landed a blow to my head, knocking me out for a few moments. When I woke back up, they were gone and so were you. I followed their scent for a while and then I lost it.\u201d</p><p>Adam snorted beside his brother, shaking his head. \u201cYou expect us to believe that you were trying to help someone other than yourself?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but I walked down the porch and over to Anthony. I held out my hands, gesturing towards his, ignoring the furious look crossing Adam\u2019s face. Anthony placed his hands in mine, and I closed my eyes. The vision happened immediately, flashing behind my closed eyelids. I saw the vampires emerging from the forest, Veronica slamming her fist into my face and knocking me out. She hoisted me over her shoulder and disappeared with me through the trees. The other two vampires continued to fight Anthony and, after about ten minutes, one landed a blow to his face so hard, his head snapped back. The vampires fled, leaving Anthony\u2019s still body in the road. Sometime later, Anthony\u2019s human side emerged. He sat up, running a hand over his head with a groan. He looked around, his eyes wild.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d he called. When he didn\u2019t get a response, he shifted back into his wolf and began sniffing the ground\u2014disappearing through the woods in the same direction the vampires had gone.</p><p>I dropped Anthony\u2019s hands and turned, walking back up to the porch.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Adam snarled. \u201cHe knows about your visions. He could have easily acted all that out, knowing you would see it and believe he\u2019s innocent.\u201d</p><p>As if someone could fool me, the voice inside my head said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \u201cHe could have acted out his actions, but he can\u2019t fake his emotions. I felt the truth in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, what happened to you?\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business,\u201d Adam snarled. \u201cShe\u2019s mine. Do you hear me? Whatever game you\u2019re playing, back the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I\u2019d have to admit, hearing him still think of me as his resurrected the butterflies in my stomach. His attitude left a lot to be desired, though.</p><p>Wade stepped through the crowd, avoiding my eyes at all cost. Add another person close to me that treated me differently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d</p><p>My eyes were on Adam, but he wouldn\u2019t look at me. Instead, he glared at his brother. As I turned to head back into the house, I noticed Maggie and Donald standing away from the crowd staring at me and talking quietly. Maggie leaned in to her husband, saying something, and he in turn did the same.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d</p><p>I looked down to find Sage standing at the end of the porch. She looked up at me, but kept her eyes focused on my forehead so as to not make eye contact with me.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sage,\u201d I said as friendly as I could. It was difficult keeping my cool, though. Adam\u2019s little outburst left me itching in my skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true then, the myth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about the story?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her inky black hair trembling around her face. Today, she wore low-slung jeans, another leather bustier, and a beaded belt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been passed down for generations in my family,\u201d she replied. \u201cOf course, we all assumed it was just a story. It\u2019s a great honor to be chosen.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cSo far, it seems like a big pain in the ass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sage surprised me by laughing. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be an adjustment. If you want, you could visit my clan in New Mexico, and we could help you through it. My grandfather knows more than I, and it would be an honor to have you as our guest.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicked to Adam. If I could learn what it meant to be the ruler of the werewolves, maybe I could control it better and be the old Anna Adam wanted.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d I told her. \u201cJust curious, though, how did you know I\u2019d been chosen?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, tucking a long strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cOther than feeling the overabundance of power rolling off you, it was your eyes. In our stories, there is mention of eyes the color of the harvest moon. Since every wolf I have ever seen has yellow eyes, I put two and two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Mexico, huh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cA little town south of Albuquerque. Adam is welcome, as well, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he can make it, but Elle and I can come. It would be fantastic to learn as much as I can about, well, myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe look forward to your visit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Sage.\u201d</p><p>She turned and headed through the crowd. When Elle was next to me again, I said, \u201cFeel like going to New Mexico?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cHave a sudden urge to search for aliens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to Roswell. We\u2019re visiting Sage\u2019s clan to learn more about the myth of the white wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider me packed.\u201d</p><p>Irony is a funny thing. Since Adam\u2019s parents arrived, his mother had been trying to talk me into leaving and, while I had considered it, I knew I never could. Now, leaving was the only thing I could think of. Of course, I didn\u2019t want to leave Adam, but I needed to learn about my new power, and I hoped the time away would be the kick in the pants Adam needed to realize how much of a douche he was being. I tried putting myself in his shoes, seeing the situation through his eyes, but no matter how I looked at it, I could not fathom not supporting him if the roles were reversed. Maybe men were made differently, and that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t understand his point of view. I may have held more power, but I still felt the same\u2014mostly.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and concentrated on Adam. Sensing his emotions was the only form of companionship I had all day. He kept his distance, and I kept mine. I could feel him like a bolt of lightning in my chest. He\u2019d been sending strong signals all day due to his anger. Right now, I felt his apprehension. I silently sent an order for him to find me, talk to me, hug me, do something other than ignore me, but my newfound powers did not include mind control, unfortunately.</p><p>My eyes fell on the sparkling diamond on my finger, and the ache started all over again. Slipping it off, I threaded it through a chain and clasped it to my neck. Having it shining back at me would be a constant reminder of what I may never have.</p><p>Two soft knocks sounded on my bedroom door. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would have gotten excited thinking it was Adam, but I sensed him farther away.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer opened my door, stepping into my room. He cracked his knuckles and then ran his hands through his hair, avoiding my eyes of course.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHey, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a piece of bread that\u2019s been soaked in water,\u201d I told him.</p> <p>He gave me a quizzical look. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling soggy?\u201d</p><p>I laughed through my nose. \u201cNo, close to falling apart. Everyone is treating me like they\u2019re afraid I\u2019ll rip their heads off, and Adam ... well, he won\u2019t even talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit it\u2019s a lot to take in.\u201d He moved farther into my room and sat on the other end of the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it, not at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see I made the list of gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not gossiping so much as gushing. No one believed it was true. I mean, yeah, when we found out you were a white wolf, stories surfaced, but still they were just stories, ya know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, playing with the edge of my pillow. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the reason I\u2019m here,\u201d Sawyer said, his tone a mixture of nervousness and excitement. \u201cElle told me you two are taking off to New Mexico, and I want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Why?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met mine briefly before he studied his clasped hands. \u201cI want to make sure you\u2019re safe, and it would be nice to get away for a while.\u201d</p><p>I studied the side of his face for a moment. \u201cAdam would be even more pissed if he found out I took you with me. He would get it in his head that you and I ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d Sawyer said, holding up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t want to stir up more trouble.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I know it was childish, but desperate times and all that. Maybe if Adam found out Sawyer was going he would be so jealous he would race to New Mexico to confess his undying love. Yeah, I know, things like that only happen in the movies. A girl can dream.</p><p>\u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer smiled. \u201cReally? What about Adam?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cAdam\u2019s insane thoughts are his problem. I think a road trip with you and Elle would be fun. We\u2019re leaving tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>I shot up in bed in a panic. My eyes flashed to Adam\u2019s side, finding it empty. Jumping out of bed, I tugged on a pair of shorts and headed down the hall. The excruciating alarm consuming my body made my lungs constrict. Something was very, very wrong.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d I said, rounding the corner of the kitchen. A group of wolves I didn\u2019t recognize sat at the table. They eyed me with caution, fidgeting restlessly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Adam?\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other, their shoulders bobbing and heads shaking. Their lack of knowledge infuriated me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Anna,\u201d Joe said, coming into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him. \u201cI can feel it, though; something has happened. Where is Adam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast I knew, he was hunting near Tie Hack. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for him to finish. Instead, I ran past him and headed outside. Tie Hack was a spot with a large lake. Tall pines and rocky cliffs lined the space. It would take at least ten to fifteen minutes to reach it. Unfortunately, I wrecked my truck a few weeks ago when Anthony had kidnapped me.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Joe said behind me. \u201cI\u2019ll drive us up there.\u201d</p><p>I followed him to his truck and hopped into the passenger\u2019s side. I bounced my leg as I waited for Joe to start the damn truck. When the engine revved to life my anxiousness eased a little bit.</p><p>\u201cYou think something happened to Adam?\u201d Joe pulled out of the drive and headed toward the main road.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t feel it?\u201d I asked with disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, Joe.\u201d A sob caught in my throat as I imagined the worst possible scenario. My vision about Adam\u2019s death played on repeat through my head. God, I\u2019d been so stupid, assuming he would be fine since Veronica was dead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Joe said, \u201cI feel something, I guess. Like I\u2019m uncomfortable in my skin.\u201d</p><p>I curled my lips inward to keep their trembling under control and ignored the trickle of tears down my cheeks. Subjects can feel when their alphas are in trouble, so how my pack wasn\u2019t going out of their minds confused me. I wasn\u2019t sure if what I was feeling was due to our Chante bond, our wolf bond, or both. My own worry, mixed with Adam\u2019s emotions, filled my chest so much that I was choking on them. Tears fell freely as I eyed the speedometer.</p><p>\u201cFaster, Joe.\u201d</p><p>The truck accelerated, Joe\u2019s fingers tightening on the steering wheel as he maneuvered the twist in the road. I bent over and rested my elbows on my legs, resting my head in my hands. My fingertips buried in my hair, I closed my eyes to try and concentrate. I pictured Adam\u2019s wolf: raven fur, sharp yellow eyes, and muscular shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAdam, can you hear me? We\u2019re coming.\u201d I sent the message to him, hoping for a response. Remembering what Adam said about not being able to feel me, made me wonder if that meant he couldn\u2019t hear me either.</p><p>\u201cIf you can hear me,\u201d I thought, \u201chold on, we\u2019re almost there. Please, please, just hold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did he leave?\u201d I asked Joe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, like a half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna ...\u201d Adam\u2019s voice filtered through my mind, but hearing it didn\u2019t bring me as much joy as I expected. It was weak and too breathy, as though it took all his energy just to get the message to me. I choked on another sob, bringing my hand to my mouth. My vision played through my mind again: Adam\u2019s body falling to the ground, his eyes fighting to stay open, blood coating his chest, and then life leaving him.</p><p>\u201cShit, shit, shit,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Joe announced.</p><p>I hopped out of the truck before it came to a full stop. As soon as my feet hit the ground, I allowed my wolf to take over. She could find him quicker than I could and run faster than my human legs could carry me.</p><p>\u201cAnna, wait,\u201d Joe called behind me, but I ignore him.</p><p>Find him. I sent the thought to my wolf as her paws beat against the hard earth. The path leading into Tie Hack opened up to the large lake. A dam sat at the end, a walkway leading to the other side of the mountain. My wolf headed in that direction, cautious as her paws stepped over the grated walkway. She didn\u2019t like the way it felt on her paws, but she knew Adam was on the other side; she could smell him. Water rushed through the dam, spit against her feet, and echoed in her ears. She had just made it across when she felt Joe behind her.</p><p>Racing up the small incline, she disappeared through the tree line. Adam was here somewhere, and was that blood we smelled?</p><p>No, no, no, I thought. \u201cAdam, I\u2019m here. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>Whatever new spidey senses I\u2019d gotten, they worked great. My wolf found Adam within ten minutes. Silently thanking her, I switched back into my human self and ran as fast as my legs could carry me to his body. He lay on the forest floor, shadowed by the tree limbs. When I reached him, I fell to my knees and gasped at the arrow sticking through his heart. His eyes were closed and his breathing shallow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAdam.\u201d I tapped his cheek. \u201cAdam, wake up. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids fluttered as though fighting with his weak body. When they opened enough for me to see his eyes, I released the breath I\u2019d been holding.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d I told him, but as I looked at the arrow sticking out of his chest and the blood staining his skin, I wasn\u2019t so sure. His naked body was cold to the touch, and his skin paler than normal.</p> <p>\u201cDo you hear me?\u201d I said, raising my voice. \u201cYou will be fine. You have to be.\u201d My voice lost its edge as I realized how much that was true. What kind of world would it be if Adam wasn\u2019t part of it?</p><p>Footsteps sounded to the left, and I whipped my head around, a snarl falling from my lips. I prayed it was the person who had done this so I could tear them apart, but when Joe\u2019s wolf stepped around the trees, I sagged back on my heels.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been shot,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d</p><p>I looked over to find Joe\u2019s naked body coming toward us. He knelt on the other side of Adam, his mouth falling open in surprise. He shot me a brief look before glancing back down to Adam, but in that moment I saw what he was thinking. He didn\u2019t think Adam would survive.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I told Joe. \u201cWe just need to get this arrow out.\u201d I began to move my hands toward it, but Joe grabbed me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIf you move it, he could bleed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already bleeding out. We have to do something.\u201d I reached for Adam\u2019s hand, squeezed it, and leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d Adam breathed, his eyelids fighting to open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I told him.</p><p>Save him, that voice inside my head whispered. You have the power.</p> <p>That same sensation I had felt in the cave washed over me, an eerie calmness that didn\u2019t fit with the setting, and suddenly I knew what to do. I clasped the arrow in both hands and when Joe began to stop me, I shot him a look that had him bowing his head and scooting away from Adam and me.</p><p>Gently, I broke the arrow in half and tried to ignore the wince wrinkling Adam\u2019s face. I threw the broken piece behind me and turned Adam on his side with as much gentleness as I could. A hiss broke through his lips, and I cringed in response.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI have to get the arrow out.\u201d</p><p>Once Adam was positioned onto his side, I gripped the part sticking through his back\u2014relieved it had gone all the way through. This would have been more difficult if the broad-head had been buried in his heart. Softly, I pulled the other half out. Adam sucked in a sharp breath and began coughing. I moved him so that he was lying on his back again. Joe shifted, wiping a hand over his face as he stared at his friend.</p><p>Leaning down, I covered the wound in Adam\u2019s chest with both of my hands and placed a soft kiss on his cool lips. My heart sped as his breathing grew shallower. I closed my eyes and rested my forehead atop my hands.</p><p>You have the power, the voice repeated.</p><p>I concentrated on the wound closing, of my power slipping from my body and into his to give him strength\u2014healing him. My new tattoo burned against my skin, and I sat up to find a slight red glow emanating from it. The harder I focused on the wound mending, the more the mark burned. Tendrils of energy traveled down my arms, to my fingertips, and into Adam\u2019s body. The spot around the wound glowed red, warming beneath my hands. I threw my head back, mouth opening as the rush of power transferred from my body into Adam\u2019s. I could feel the skin moving beneath my palm, shifting as it stitched itself back together.</p><p>Dizziness blurred my vision and, before I realized it, a vision played out behind my eyelids.</p> <p>I saw Adam\u2019s black wolf weaving through the trees, shadowed in the cover of darkness. A form stepped out from the trees, raising a crossbow, and by the time Adam realized what was going on, the arrow was already sailing through the air. When it smacked against his chest, a sharp pain burned my own. Adam went down instantly, and the attacker fled through the woods.</p><p>When I opened my eyes, I looked down at Adam and found him staring at me. I removed my hands from his wound and began laughing and crying. The wound was completely gone, just the smear of blood remaining. Joe moved closer to inspect Adam\u2019s chest and gasped when he didn\u2019t find a hole. I could feel his eyes on me, but I couldn\u2019t stop looking at Adam.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Adam asked, sitting up slowly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him honestly. \u201cI healed you somehow.\u201d</p><p>He eyed me warily for only a moment, and then his hand was in my hair and he was guiding my face to his. He kissed me so fervently that it felt as though he was breathing life into me. My body came alive, wild with desire for him. I fisted my hands in his hair and kissed him back with as much dedication as he gave.</p><p>\u201cUh, should I leave?\u201d</p><p>Adam and I broke the kiss; I was laughing from the joy of seeing Adam healed.</p><p>\u201cNo, man,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to head home.\u201d</p><p>Joe and I helped Adam up, and the three of us walked back to the truck. Adam kept his arm slung around my shoulders, either for support or because he wanted me close.</p><p>\u201cDid you see who shot you?\u201d Joe asked. I already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cNo, just a shadow, and by then it was too late.\u201d He looked down at me, his fingers squeezing my shoulder. \u201cI was dying,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI could feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I replied. \u201cI think I felt the exact moment you got shot. It\u2019s how I knew to find you. I\u2019m just happy you told someone where you were going.\u201d</p><p>He hugged me against his side, pressing a kiss to the top of my head. A mental thought of a human coming across the three of us naked made me laugh. Then again, it was nearly one in the morning, and the possibility that humans would camp in this area was slim.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNothing, I\u2019m just happy you\u2019re okay. You are, aren\u2019t you? You feel fine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell don\u2019t feel like I was shot in the heart with an arrow. A little tired, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled up at him. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Back at the house, a small group of wolves stood on the lawn. When we emerged from the truck, clapping and cheers broke out. I could see the relief on our pack member\u2019s faces as they watched Adam walking on his own.</p><p>People patted Adam on the back as we made it up the porch and into the house. I guess my freak out had gotten around, and everyone suspected something horrible had happened. And it had. No matter how unsure I was about my new wolfy powers and how much it unsettled Adam, I would never resent having them now. They had saved my mate\u2019s life; my wolf had saved his life, and I would forever be thankful.</p><p>After everyone greeted Adam, only members of the Everwood pack remained in the main house. Adam, Joe, and I dressed and met in the kitchen. Elle fixed sandwiches for everyone, and I was grateful to have something to fill my empty stomach. I didn\u2019t remember the last time I had eaten.</p><p>After explaining what had happened, I got a few questioning glances from my pack. I admit, healing someone was a little bizarre. More than that, they watched me with something resembling fear, and that stung. Wolves can lend power if they\u2019re alphas, but even then, it\u2019s not strong enough to bring a person back from the brink of death.</p><p>\u201cYou think it was Taren?\u201d Wade asked, taking a bite of his sandwich.</p><p>\u201cCould have been,\u201d I said. \u201cI did kill Veronica, and this could be his way at getting back to me. The thing is, this was different than my vision.\u201d</p><p>Wade chewed a few times and then said, \u201cVisions aren\u2019t set in stone, Anna. They change depending on people\u2019s actions. You killed Veronica and the two others, so the future shifted to accommodate that.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I didn\u2019t like how he talked about the future as though it was a living, breathing thing. Hell, maybe it was. The universe is too big to understand. Maybe some mystical being sat amongst the clouds, strings dangling from his or her hands, controlling everybody\u2019s actions. After becoming part of the supernatural community, I wouldn\u2019t bet against it.</p><p>\u201cYou said that Taren acted afraid of you,\u201d Adam said. \u201cDo you think he would risk coming back here to attack me just to get back at you?\u201d</p><p>I eyed Adam, happy to see the color returning to his face. \u201cHonestly, no. If Taren willingly left Veronica because he was afraid of me, I can\u2019t see him coming back here to avenge her death. No, whoever shot you, is the one who hired the vampires in the first place.\u201d I reached for his hand and squeezed. \u201cThe vampires were lying about Anthony, but I know it was a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they lie about Anthony?\u201d Elle asked, taking the seat next to me.</p><p>I thought about it for a second. \u201cIt was smart and stupid at the same time. Smart because whoever it is knows that Adam and his brother don\u2019t get along, and everyone would automatically believe it was Anthony. I mean, he did kidnap me after all. But it was stupid because they\u2019re screwing with someone who has visions. They had to have known I would eventually see the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they thought you would be dead before then,\u201d Elle added.</p><p>\u201cThe question is,\u201d Wade said, \u201cwhy are they doing this? Who hates you enough to want to kill you, or Adam, for that matter?\u201d</p><p>That was a very good question, and only two names came to mind: Maggie and Donald Everwood. None of the other wolves knew me well enough to want me dead. And if I\u2019d learned anything from watching crime shows, it was that politicians and wealthy families would go to desperate measures to make sure their family name remained clean. Having a mutt in the family would only soil their bloodline. Then again, why would they shoot their own son? Nothing about this ordeal made a lick of sense, and it was driving me crazy.</p><p>\u201cWe can send tracking teams out,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI\u2019ll oversee everything so you can get some sleep.\u201d He rested his hand on Adam\u2019s shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was supposed to be leaving for New Mexico tomorrow, but I couldn\u2019t until we caught this person. Just thinking about what would have happened if I hadn\u2019t gotten to Adam in time caused my stomach to twist with pain.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one good thing that will come out of this,\u201d Adam said. At our questioning looks, he said, \u201cThey will never ask me to host a conference again.\u201d We all laughed and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a murder mystery dinner party.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, where the attendees could literally die,\u201d Elle said.</p><p>We all nodded in agreement, silence settling around the table as each person thought. I rested my head in my hand and rubbed my forehead, closing my eyes. I tried to think of a logical suspect, someone other than Adam\u2019s parents, but the only thing I saw was Adam\u2019s bleeding body in the forest. I had a feeling I would be seeing it for a while. I thought about the vision I had and the shadowed figure that shot him. From what I remembered the few times I\u2019d seen Taren, the shooter was shorter than him. Was it another vampire or the employer?</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should tell everyone to go home,\u201d I said and everyone looked at me. \u201cI know the conference has another week, but I\u2019m tired of worrying every time we go outside that another arrow is going to find its way into one of our hearts. If the person responsible is from one of the visiting packs, then maybe they\u2019ll take their vendetta home with them.\u201d Even as I said it, I knew I was wrong. Someone that twisted wouldn\u2019t just up and forget about wanting me dead.</p><p>Adam rubbed my back, his fingers coming up and squeezing my shoulder. \u201cI think it\u2019s best everyone remain here until we catch whoever is doing this. Maybe tomorrow you can start reading people.\u201d At my frown, he smiled. \u201cYou can read Chloe first. Just think of all the dirt she\u2019s hiding. You could own her with it.\u201d</p><p>I admit that did make this whole ordeal a little more bearable. Then again, I didn\u2019t want to spend an entire day seeing the history of the visiting wolves. I wanted my mountain back and everyone to leave, like now.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll start tonight,\u201d I said, standing up.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>I knocked on the door to Adam\u2019s old house where Chloe and Cadie were staying. The interior was dark behind the windows, and I smiled at the thought of pissing them off by waking them up. Lights flipped on, illuminating the house, and footsteps echoed as someone headed toward the door. I silently prayed that I would find incriminating information by reading Chloe. Other than Adam\u2019s parents, she was my only other suspect.</p><p>The door swung open to reveal Cadie. As soon as she saw me, a scowl distorted her pretty face. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>I smiled brightly. \u201cI thought we girls could have a slumber party,\u201d I told her sarcastically. She rolled her eyes and began to slam the door in my face, but I shot out my hand and stopped it from closing. I ignored the huff coming from her lips and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cThat was very rude,\u201d I told her. \u201cEspecially since this is not your home. You are a guest here. I expect for you to show some respect.\u201d I was not in the mood to deal with a snotty werewolf ho. One wrong word and I was afraid I would kill them both. Adam\u2019s near brush with death had me tiptoeing between the edge of sanity and insanity. My wolf bristled beneath my skin, agitated and ready to break free, and I was tempted to let her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Cadie\u2019s face changed from annoyed to afraid. Her lips parted, and she stared at the ground, giving me a wide berth as I moved farther into the house. I hadn\u2019t been in here since I came looking for information on Eve. Her decorating touches still remained in the house, reminding me she was still here in a way.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Chloe?\u201d I spun around and faced Cadie. Her long brown hair was pulled up in a messy ponytail. I flicked a glance at her tank top that had a picture of a silhouetted wolf and the words Trophy Wife scrawled across the top. I quirked an eyebrow in disgust.</p><p>\u201cNothing like advertising your gold-digger-ness,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Cadie said, pressing her body against the wall as though the space between us still wasn\u2019t enough. I smiled, taking a step closer. I had felt the effects of a powerful wolf and knew how suffocating it could be. I moved so close to her that she had to turn her face so that our lips didn\u2019t meet.</p><p>\u201cThen go wake her up,\u201d I said slowly.</p><p>Cadie didn\u2019t waste any time; she slid away from me and scurried down the hall. A wide smile bent my lips upward. Having this odd power might not be so bad.</p><p>Five minutes later, I heard Cadie and Chloe down the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell her to leave?\u201d Chloe asked.</p> <p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Cadie said. \u201cShe\u2019s different now, powerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say,\u201d Chloe murmured. \u201cBut I doubt she\u2019s changed that much.\u201d</p><p>When they rounded the corner, I was leaning against the wall, my arms crossed over my chest. My eyes instantly connected with Chloe\u2019s, and I grinned.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on,\u201d I goaded. \u201cI must have changed enough to scare you. You did retract your challenge, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m more than willing to meet you in the field if you\u2019ve changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>Chloe eyed Cadie, and then they both stared at the wall in front of them. Having people avoiding my eyes was still awkward as hell, but I didn\u2019t mind scaring these two.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset Adam,\u201d Chloe said.</p><p>\u201cHow would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicked to mine and then away. \u201cBy winning the challenge.\u201d</p><p>I full out laughed, almost to the point of tears. My wolf\u2019s amusement bled through me and intensified my merriment. After a few seconds, I got myself under control, but still smiled.</p><p>\u201cI would love for you to prove that,\u201d I said. \u201cAll of a sudden I\u2019m in the mood for a good fight. What do you say?\u201d My smile disappeared, and I moved toward the two women, my fingers curled into a fist. Knowing Chloe\u2019s sole purpose of wanting to fight me was so she could claim Adam amplified my seriousness and anger. I wanted nothing more than to soak the earth with her blood. Then again, maybe that was my wolf\u2019s thoughts coming through. It was difficult to separate the two.</p><p>\u201cUh ... is that why ... you came here?\u201d Chloe asked, her voice shaky.</p><p>I was silent for a while, enough to scare her. \u201cNo, I\u2019m here to read you.\u201d</p><p>Cadie and Chloe looked at each other nervously and then at the floor. Interesting. Without warning, I grabbed her arm and waited for my mind to be filled with her history. Only, nothing happened. I frowned, gripping her arm tighter. Chloe let out a painful moan as my nails dug into her skin. Small rivulets of blood seeped from the broken skin, and my mind and vision blurred.</p><p>Chloe and Cadie were standing on a path in the forest, another person in front of them. The stranger had a sweatshirt on, the hoodie up to cover his or her features.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cSo you\u2019re the one who hired the vampires?\u201d</p><p>The stranger didn\u2019t say a word as they raised the crossbow out in front of them, aimed right for Chloe\u2019s heart. Chloe held up her hands and took a step back. Cadie\u2019s forehead wrinkled as she moved with her friend. It was obvious who the boss was in their friendship.</p><p>\u201cNo need to get violent,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cI\u2019m on your side. Once Anna is out of the picture, Adam will be mine. You\u2019re doing me a favor.\u201d</p><p>The stranger tilted his or her head to the side and lowered the crossbow. \u201cIf you tell anyone, you\u2019re next.\u201d Though the person spoke just above a whisper, the voice had been female. That would help narrow down our search.</p><p>I blinked, fighting off the effects of the vision, and stared at the two women. I didn\u2019t let go of Chloe\u2019s arm. Instead, I dug my nails in deeper.</p><p>\u201cYou knew the entire time, and you didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d</p><p>Chloe let out a whimper, sliding down the wall as I twisted her arm. \u201cNot the entire time,\u201d she stammered. \u201cWe just found out two days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I yelled, digging my fingernails in deeper. Cadie started to inch away, and I shot out my other hand and grabbed a handful of her shirt, slamming her against the wall. Her head bounced off the logs, and tears began falling against her cheeks.</p><p>When neither of them spoke, I released them both and took a step away. I knew how difficult it was to think while in the presence of a more powerful wolf. Hoping my distance helped clear their minds, I crossed my arms and waited for either of them to confess.</p><p>\u201cDid you know they almost killed Adam tonight? If I hadn\u2019t gotten there in time, he would be dead. You let them go because you wanted him, right? You could have been the reason he died.\u201d I paused and looked between the two women. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you pretend to care about him.\u201d</p><p>Chloe snickered, standing up. \u201cI never said I cared about him. You should know by now that the pairing of werewolves does not include feelings. He\u2019s an olde blood\u2014a social status\u2014and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Revulsion filled my stomach at how cavalier her remark was. \u201cSo why not go after Anthony? He\u2019s an olde blood, too, and looks exactly like Adam.\u201d</p><p>Chloe and Cadie shared a look, a small laugh falling from their lips as though I just suggested they date the band geek.</p><p>\u201cBecause Adam has a pack,\u201d Chloe said simply.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only reason you wanted him, because he has a pack?\u201d Now was my turn to laugh. \u201cSo hook up with Anthony, and create a pack.\u201d</p><p>Chloe let out a heavy breath, followed by the roll of her eyes. \u201cOne cannot simply start a pack, Anna. It has to be sanctioned by the Leaders, and no Leader in their right mind would allow Anthony to create a pack.\u201d</p><p>A silent, \u201cwhy not\u201d filled my head but after seeing what he and Eve did with their little band of followers I had a good idea. Even after everything Anthony did, I still couldn\u2019t look down my nose at him like the others. That bothered me, a lot. I didn\u2019t want to have a soft spot for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s rebel brother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf Adam died\u2014like he almost did tonight\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have a pack anymore either. So I\u2019m only going to ask you this one more time. Who hired the vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d a female said behind me.</p><p>I whirled around and met the butt end of something very hard. It smashed into my face, and then I was falling to the floor. Lights out.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>I came to with a nasty headache and a bad temper. Blinking, I cringed as pain infiltrated the spot over my left eye. I quickly realized that my hands were bound\u2014silver, if the burning sensation was any indication.</p><p>\u201cIf I never wake up shackled again, it\u2019ll be too soon,\u201d I said to myself, wiggling the manacles that held my wrists. The smell of burnt flesh filled the air around me\u2014my flesh. As I moved my arms, the silver singed more of my skin. Giving up, I took in my surroundings. I was in the forest ... somewhere. The shackles wound around the base of a small tree, causing me to lie on my side. Scooting, I moved into a sitting position, wincing every time the silver rubbed against my wrists.</p><p>\u201cAnna,\u201d someone whispered.</p><p>I looked over one shoulder, and then the other, trying to find the owner of the voice. Branches cracked as someone moved toward me. I began tugging at the manacles, praying my strength was enough to break them. My new badass powers were useless if I was tied up.</p> <p>\u201cAnna, it\u2019s me.\u201d Anthony stepped out from behind a tree, his eyes darting to the right and then back at me. I watched as he moved closer, wondering if he knew who the employer of the vampires was like Chloe and Cadie had. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he wanted Adam dead, too.</p><p>\u201cAre you with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d He knelt down in front of me and grabbed onto the shackles, flinging his hand away when his skin sizzled. \u201cSon of a bitch ... silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem,\u201d I said again, \u201cChloe, Cadie, and the psycho who hired the vampires.\u201d</p><p>A look crossed his face, something resembling ... disappointment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cChloe and Cadie know who it is? Do you, did you see who it was when they,\u201d he nodded toward my captive state, \u201cdid this?\u201d</p><p>I studied him for a moment, unsure if I could trust him or not. Earlier when I read him, his innocence came through loud and clear, but that could have changed. Maybe he figured it all out and decided to switch sides.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I finally said. \u201cThe bitch knocked me out before I saw who she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d Anthony questioned with surprise.</p><p>\u201cIs it so surprising that a woman could be behind this?\u201d I said. \u201cEve was a psychopath after all.\u201d I glared at him.</p><p>He nodded, but didn\u2019t say anything; instead, he lifted the hem of his shirt and tugged it over his head. My eyes widened at the gesture, wondering what in the world he was doing. My eyes casually roamed over the ridges and valleys that made up his muscular chest and stomach. When he noticed I was appraising him, a smile curved his lips. Quickly looking away, I cursed myself for checking him out.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, coming up behind me and looping his shirt around the silver chain. His arms framed either side of my body and his face rested against my own. He gripped either side of the chain, and I felt the muscles in his arms flex. \u201cWhen you first brought up Eve, I thought it was because you were still pissed about what she did.\u201d He tugged against the chains, keeping his hands safely on the fabric of his shirt. \u201cBut now,\u201d he continued, \u201cI wonder if you keep bringing her up because you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>At that I laughed. \u201cJealous? Of Eve?\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d I leaned away from him as much as I could. His face was too close to mine, and it felt more intimate than a rescue demanded.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, tugging harder. \u201cBut maybe the thought of both Adam and me being with her drives you crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, yes. You, no. I don\u2019t care who you\u2019re with.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes cut to mine, a slight smirk on his lips. \u201cYou pull off that indifference attitude very well, but I\u2019m not buying it. I know you feel something whenever I\u2019m around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, disgust,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>His smirk turned into a full smile, and he tugged at the chains again, his knuckles white with the strain. The links groaned with the pressure and snapped without warning, flinging both of us back onto the ground. I landed on Anthony\u2019s body, his arms instinctually coming around me during the fall. When I began to get up, he released me and stood up with me. I couldn\u2019t meet his eyes, if for no other reason than being pissed that he thought there was something between us ... or at least that\u2019s what I told myself.</p><p>\u201cI think you use sarcasm when you don\u2019t want to deal with the truth,\u201d Anthony said, picking up his shirt and sliding it over his head. \u201cAvoiding the issue won\u2019t make it go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no issue,\u201d I snapped. Meeting his eyes, I smoothed my face into a perfect mask of nonchalance. \u201cYou want me because I\u2019m Adam\u2019s. It\u2019s your sick little way of screwing with your brother.\u201d</p><p>Anthony slowly shook his head. He rubbed his jaw with his hand, staring at me through a fringe of thick lashes. Something blossomed in my stomach, hot and hungry. I imagined the emotion as a tangible thing and envisioned ripping it out. I loved Adam and whatever bizarre reaction I had toward his brother would not change that.</p><p>\u201cEve was never Adam\u2019s,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cShe and I were dating when my parents made the deal with her parents. Once a deal is struck, that pair is mated. Do you think it was easy to watch her be given to him? They didn\u2019t even like each other and because of that, Adam allowed us to still see each other. This,\u201d he waved his finger at the space between the two of us, \u201chas nothing to do with Adam.\u201d</p><p>Talk about dysfunctional.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t care that you think you feel something for me or what imaginary scenario you\u2019ve cooked up in your head. You and I,\u201d I mimicked his gesture and waved a finger at the space between us, \u201care never going to happen. It\u2019s cool you\u2019re trying to be a better person and don\u2019t share Eve\u2019s abhorrence toward humans, but I love Adam.\u201d</p><p>That stupid smirk fell across his mouth again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNothing, it\u2019s just, when you say that, that you love Adam ...\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t finish, my frustration grew. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath through his nose. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re saying it for my benefit. It sounds like you\u2019re trying to convince yourself.\u201d</p><p>He passed me, moving through the forest. I glared at his back, tempted to tackle him to the ground and rip out his throat. Pissed, I followed after him, stomping over downed logs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a smug son of a bitch, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told,\u201d he said offhand. \u201cBut on this, I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you are. I don\u2019t know what your angle is, but it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and turned to face me. \u201cBecause you love Adam.\u201d His tone made it clear how much he didn\u2019t believe that.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cThen kiss me,\u201d he said, taking a step closer.</p><p>I took a step back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any feelings for me and are sure you love Adam, prove it by kissing me.\u201d</p><p>I scowled at him. \u201cI think that would be the opposite of proving that I love Adam.\u201d</p><p>I started walking again, keeping my eyes open for whoever chained me up. They were bound to come back sometime soon. A thought occurred to me then: I should wait for them. Why the hell was I leaving the spot I knew they would return to. I stopped and turned around, ignoring the grin decorating Anthony\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t want to because you know you\u2019ll enjoy it too much. It will disprove what you keep saying.\u201d</p><p>I whirled around and poked a finger in the air. \u201cI\u2019m not twelve, and your goading is not going to work. I\u2019m not kissing you. Thank you for helping me escape, but I can handle the rest on my own.\u201d I paused, another thought coming to me. \u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d</p><p>Anthony shrugged. \u201cI followed you.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows rose. \u201cSo now you\u2019re stalking me? Why didn\u2019t you see who tied me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you go into Adam\u2019s old house and about thirty minutes later someone carried you out over their shoulder. The person had a crossbow, and I figured it would be smart to keep my distance, otherwise a hostage scenario could have happened. When they left, I waited another ten minutes, and the rest you know ...\u201d</p><p>So they hadn\u2019t been gone for very long. That was good news. I made my way back toward the tree and silently cursed when Anthony followed me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSetting a trap,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou can leave.\u201d He had already distracted me enough, and I was ready to find out the identity of the person who tried to kill Adam and me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou already managed to get knocked out and chained up. The next time I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be so lucky.\u201d</p><p>I kicked the silver manacles away from the tree and covered them with leaves and dirt. Sitting down, I wrapped my hands around the trunk of the tree in hopes of fooling my captor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said. \u201cRun along ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that sarcasm,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cMakes me wonder if you\u2019re nervous about confronting the person, or about being around me.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head against the rough bark of the tree, closing my eyes and inhaling a breath. Anthony was relentless and delusional, both of which frustrated me until I thought I would blow steam out of my ears.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do to make you understand that I feel nothing when it comes to you? Why my countless testimonies don\u2019t prove it is beyond me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anthony knelt down in front of me, casting a quick glance over his shoulder. His eyes searched mine for a few moments before they fell to my lips. His tongue came out and licked a path along his bottom lip. That stupid warmth tightened in my stomach, and I mentally kicked it away. It meant nothing.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cYour words are just words. They lack conviction, but a kiss ... you cannot fake what it will say.\u201d</p><p>My eyes landed on his full lips and then to his green eyes. If a kiss would give him the proof he needed, wouldn\u2019t it be worth it to never hear about this again? He could leave knowing that I was right and that there was nothing between the two of us, but most importantly, that I loved his brother.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d As I said it, every muscle in my body tightened. If my wolf disagreed with me, she didn\u2019t make it known. In fact, a spectral sense of anticipation filled me. I knew it was her emotions bleeding into mine, and that surprised me.</p><p>Anthony\u2019s large hand cupped the side of my face. He spread his fingers, his pinky caressing my bottom lip. Slowly, he leaned toward me and stopped just in front of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cOnce the truth is out,\u201d he breathed against my lips, \u201cthere\u2019s no hiding from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d I breathed, knowing he was about to be disappointed.</p><p>At the first contact of his lips on mine, my eyelids slipped closed. He moved his mouth against mine, soft and deliberate. When he sucked my bottom lip into his mouth, I stifled a moan. I would not give him the satisfaction of knowing I was enjoying any part of this. I kept my mouth hard, allowing him to kiss me without kissing him back. A low growl vibrated in his throat and ignited something inside of me. Wrapping an arm around my waist, he tugged me hard against his chest. His mouth worked fervently against my own, urging me to join. I stood my ground, not giving into the kiss and praying it would be over soon.</p> <p>Anthony broke away from my mouth, but held me tightly against his body. His eyes burned like coals, glowing against the darkness surrounding us.</p><p>\u201cI will kiss every single inch of you until you give into me, Anna. If you want to prove me wrong, you have to kiss me back.\u201d</p><p>He brought his mouth back to mine and picked up where he left off, slanting his lips over mine. That tingling warmth in my stomach ignited like gasoline on a fire. I gave in, moving my lips against his. When his tongue slipped between my lips, my body melted against his. He sucked, licked, and kissed me like I was water, and he was dehydrated. I was so dizzy from the kiss that I couldn\u2019t think straight. My wolf surfaced and became ravenous for more of him. I needed to feel his flesh on mine, to be closer.</p><p>Someone cleared their throat and in turn, my head. Anthony broke away from my mouth, his eyes starving for me. I was embarrassed to think my own reflected the hunger in his. A slow smile creased his mouth, and I could almost hear his voice whisper, I told you so, inside my head. Tears blurred my vision at the revelation. I knew without a doubt that I loved Adam, so why did kissing his brother affect me as much as it had? I should have been unaffected, repulsed, right?</p><p>\u201cI wondered if something was going on with you two,\u201d a female said behind Anthony. He stood up and cleared my line of sight. Chelsea stood just ten feet away, her arm bent up and holding a crossbow. My mouth automatically fell into an O, shocked to my core.</p><p>\u201cChelsea?\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged. \u201cSurprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? But ... why?\u201d</p><p>She took a couple steps toward, me and Anthony stepped in front of me. \u201cUh huh, Romeo,\u201d she said, holding out the crossbow toward him. \u201cBack up or end up with a silver arrow through the chest.\u201d</p><p>Anthony stepped to the side, his eyes flicking to mine. I still had my arms wound around the tree, and I hoped Chelsea didn\u2019t notice that I wasn\u2019t shackled and start firing that crossbow. She moved closer, keeping a safe distance from Anthony.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever stop to think that I had a life before becoming a werewolf?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Honestly, I hadn\u2019t even thought about it. I was an only child, and both of my parents were dead. When I was bitten and transformed into a wolf, I wasn\u2019t leaving anything behind by coming up here and living with my new pack. In that moment, I felt like a horrible person. Chelsea had been moody since the change, and I brushed it off thinking she just needed to get used to it. Was I really so wrapped up in my own stuff that I didn\u2019t see her pain?</p><p>\u201cI thought not,\u201d Chelsea snorted. \u201cWell, I did. I had a boyfriend, and we had been talking about getting married before this happened.\u201d She held out her hands to signal herself. \u201cWe\u2019re not permitted to be with humans. Not that Joel would want me now any way.\u201d Her eyes burned with her hurt and anger, singeing me from the inside out. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d it\u2019s all his fault.\u201d I nodded toward Anthony.</p> <p>Chelsea swung her arm around and pointed the crossbow at him. His hands shot up in surrender. \u201cWay to throw me under the bus, Anna.\u201d He shot me a displeased look, and I shrugged. So maybe I was still angry about the kiss and my reaction to it. Looking at Chelsea, he said, \u201cAnna is right in that she didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. She was just as much of a victim as you were.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so now my tactic to get the focus on Anthony made me feel like shit. Why couldn\u2019t he be the asshole we all knew him to be? It would be a lot less confusing. \u201cBut,\u201d he continued, \u201ckidnapping you was all Eve\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>So instead of throwing me under the bus, he was throwing his dead girlfriend out there. I guess he was still the asshole. Not that he wasn\u2019t right, but was it really all Eve?</p><p>\u201cShe had a vendetta against Anna and knew she could trick her if she had you. Anna would never let harm come to an innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she did!\u201d Chelsea snarled. \u201cI was innocent, didn\u2019t know a fucking thing about your world until my chance meeting with Anna. Talk about bad luck.\u201d</p><p>I had run into Chelsea at Wal-Mart while Wade and Adam were trying to get me used to being around humans. It just so happened that Chelsea was working there at the time. When I ran into her, Eve and her goons had been following me and kidnapped Chelsea knowing that I would fall into their trap to try and save her. So, in a way, it was kind of my fault. Just being associated with me had targeted Chelsea. Since I didn\u2019t have family to hold as captive, Eve used the next best thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I told her. \u201cReally, I am, but it could have been worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Chelsea asked. \u201cI turn into a fucking animal every full moon and had to break Joel\u2019s heart. He thinks I fell out of love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens,\u201d Anthony muttered, his eyes on me.</p><p>Ignoring him, I said, \u201cYou could have died from the infection of the bite. Yes, you were unlucky by being targeted by Eve, but you were lucky that the magic in the wolf saliva chose you to become one of us. Most people do not make it through the transition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know what really sent me over the edge?\u201d Chelsea asked, kneeling down so that we were eye level. She couldn\u2019t hold my gaze, but she tried. At my shrug, she continued. \u201cThat,\u201d she nodded toward my chest. I looked down and found my engagement ring hanging from my necklace. \u201cI lost everything, and now I have to live through you getting it.\u201d Her eyes flitted over to Anthony. \u201cThen again, how long could it possibly last when you\u2019re cheating on Adam with his brother? Trouble in paradise already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... didn\u2019t cheat on him ... not really,\u201d I stuttered, but that\u2019s exactly what it felt like. I had kissed a man while engaged to another. \u201cIt was just a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, and I don\u2019t care,\u201d Chelsea said, standing. She pointed the crossbow at me. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be doing Adam a favor by ridding him of a cheating fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChelsea, listen,\u201d I said, pretending to still be bounded by the shackles. I twisted my body so that I could see her better. \u201cI know you\u2019re angry about what happened, but it does get better, and I know it\u2019ll take some time to get over Joel, but what about Wade?\u201d</p><p>Her face scrunched in confusion. \u201cWade? What about him?\u201d</p><p>Now it was my turn to be confused. \u201cHe likes you ... a lot. Hasn\u2019t he told you?\u201d I was grasping at straws, but I needed an opening, one where that damned crossbow wasn\u2019t aimed right at my face.</p><p>Her eyes volleyed between Anthony and me. \u201cI\u2019m not like you, Anna. I actually loved Joel. We had been together for four years. I planned to spend the rest of my life with him. I can\u2019t just turn that off and hop into bed with another man.\u201d</p><p>I should have been angry that she just called me a slut, but I was more ashamed of myself. I wanted to tell her that I did love Adam, but then how could I kiss his brother and enjoy it? I thought about Adam finding out and the anger his face would hold, how he would look at me differently, and I crumbled inside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m a bad person, but then so are you for orchestrating this entire thing. You hired vampires to kill me. Isn\u2019t that worse than kissing another man?\u201d I let my words sink in and watched her eyes brighten with fury. \u201cBy the way, how the hell did you have the money to pay them? By the sounds of it, it was a big paycheck.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of my plan. While cleaning Adam\u2019s house for our arriving guest, I came across his safe, and his key was just sitting in his desk, tempting me. It was his money that would have paid for your death. Priceless, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vampires?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow did you contact them? I\u2019ve never even met one until they showed up here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she thought about her plan, impressed with herself. \u201cWade took me to that seedy little brothel, Wild Things, in town and I met the most interesting people. It\u2019s amazing what people will tell you when they\u2019re drunk off their asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said. \u201cIt looks like you thought of everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to turn into the mythical white wolf, or survive the vampires after they kidnapped you.\u201d</p><p>The memory of walking to our house after I escaped the vampires filled my head. Chelsea had been surprised to see me, but at the time, I thought it was because I was naked or the change in my eye color. Now, it all made sense. She hadn\u2019t expected to see me again.</p><p>\u201cAnd one other thing,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah?</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I slowly fisted a handful of dirt into my hand and whipped my arm around to fling it at her face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t expect me to break my silver shackles.\u201d</p><p>She clawed at her face, trying to rid her eyes of the debris. I shot up and jumped into action. Reaching for her hand, I held it up so that if she fired, the arrow would shoot straight into the air and not into Anthony or me. Chelsea snarled and kicked out, watching me through the slits in her puffy eyes. Together, we went down, me on top of her. I kept a firm grip on the arm holding the crossbow and straddled her stomach.</p><p>\u201cGive up, it\u2019s over,\u201d I told her.</p><p>Anthony walked over to the two of us and fought the crossbow out of her grasp. He aimed it at Chelsea but she continued to fight me. Fed up, I pinned both or her arms to the ground and growled in her face.</p> <p>\u201cStop.\u201d I coated my words with the authority of my wolf, feeling the tingling power seeping through my skin.</p><p>Chelsea\u2019s body became still. She closed her eyes and began crying, the sound distraught and haunting.</p><p>\u201cKill me,\u201d she whispered, opening her eyes. They were red from her tears and the dirt I had thrown in them. \u201cPlease,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a werewolf. My life ended the day I had to walk away from Joel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll go to a special supernatural prison where you can come to terms with your new life and hopefully enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>She began bawling, big sorrowful sobs falling from her lips. \u201cPlease ... just kill me.\u201d</p><p>I slapped the side of her face hard enough to stop her breakdown. \u201cIs losing a boyfriend really worth killing yourself over? Do you think he\u2019ll kill himself over losing you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just him,\u201d she snarled and spit into my face. \u201cI hate what I have become. Do you understand? I hate it.\u201d</p><p>Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath and wiped away the spit on my face. I thought about everything she had done, but especially how she almost killed Adam. That was enough to turn my patience into full-blown rage.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, jumping off her. \u201cYou want to die?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t make a move to get up. Instead, she lay on the ground, her arms outstretched as she stared up at the canopy of trees. As I stared at her, I wondered how someone could loathe herself as much as she did\u2014to the point of welcoming death with open arms. She was lost in a sea of pain and loss, and nothing I said would change her mind.</p><p>\u201cGive me the crossbow,\u201d I said to Anthony, holding my hand out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said.</p><p>I turned toward him. \u201cGive me the fucking crossbow.\u201d</p><p>He held it out of reach. \u201cYou\u2019re angry now, but when that dies down, you\u2019ll regret pulling the trigger. Let me do it, I\u2019m the heartless monster, right?\u201d</p> <p>We stared at each other for a moment, and then he walked around me and poised the arrow over Chelsea\u2019s heart. My own slammed against my ribcage with the knowledge of what was coming.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Chelsea whispered right before she closed her eyes.</p><p>A whoosh of air sounded and ended in a thump. Chelsea gasped, her hands coming up to grasp the arrow sticking out of her heart. Tears trickled down her cheeks and dampened the ground beneath her. Red stained her shirt, seeping through the fabric, and then her head lolled to the side and the life left her eyes.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Two days later, and I was packed and ready to leave. I had done my best to avoid Anthony, but he kept popping up. He would send me secret smiles that made me nauseous. The guilt of knowing what those smiles meant ate at me, and lying to Adam didn\u2019t help either. I wanted to tell him, confess to everything, but I was too afraid of losing him. What logical man would stay with me after something like that? Still, I knew the truth would eventually come out, and I had to be ready for it.</p><p>After talking with Sage and Leif a few times, I learned that there were stories of having the Chante mark removed. They didn\u2019t know if there was any truth to the stories, but it was enough to give me hope. If ridding myself of the mark that bound Adam and I together meant I could also rid Anthony of his bizarre bond, then I would do it. I knew it wasn\u2019t the sole reason why Adam and I were together. A scar did not determine how I felt for Adam. I had been telling myself that repeatedly, working myself into believing it.</p><p>Wade ended up leaving the mountain after I told everyone what had happened with Chelsea. He didn\u2019t say it, but I knew her death and betrayal hurt him. Maybe he felt guilty for not making his move sooner, thinking it could have helped take her mind off her previous boyfriend. Since I had been with her in the end, I knew nothing Wade could have done would have helped. Adam informed me that some werewolves would either commit suicide or go insane from not being able to handle their inner beasts. No matter who pulled the trigger on the crossbow, Chelsea\u2019s blood was on my hands. Her life changed the moment Eve learned she knew me.</p><p>I fingered the necklace I had taken off her, a bird emblem made out of mother of pearl. It was a reminder that things are not always what they seem, and the heart can drive a person to do crazy things, but mostly, it was a reminder that I was responsible for an innocent woman losing her life.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Elle called through the house.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a second.\u201d I headed into my bedroom to retrieve my purse and found Anthony playing with my cell phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in my room?\u201d</p><p>He held up my phone and tilted it back and forth. \u201cProgramming my number into your phone,\u201d he said. \u201cI told you, once the truth was out, there was no avoiding it. Enjoy your trip, and keep an eye out for my messages.\u201d He handed me my phone, moving past me with a smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cAnthony,\u201d I said in a harsh whisper, hoping no one could hear us. He turned, crossing his arms across his chest. Again, I thought about how much he and Adam looked alike, and I hated it. \u201cPlease, just stop. Just forget about what happened, and let me be happy with Adam.\u201d If there were any truth to the removal of the Chante bond, then I wouldn\u2019t have to plead with him. I yearned for that day.</p><p>\u201cYou knew the rules before I kissed you, Anna. You cannot deny you felt something, so I will do everything in my power to make sure you remember it.\u201d Without another word, he turned and headed down the hall. My stomach plummeted when Adam stepped into view. He smiled at me, and I felt it like a jab in my chest. He deserved someone better than me.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked. \u201cElle\u2019s having a cow out there.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat and shouldered my purse, dropping my cell inside. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I held the tears back as I headed down the hall toward the only man I had ever loved. It was just like me to screw something this perfect up. Run away before things get too serious, my inner voice said, reminding me of my relationship M.O. Maybe kissing Anthony was my subconscious way of self-sabotaging what I had with Adam.</p><p>As I moved toward Adam, I made a silent vow that I would do everything in my power to rid myself of the strange reaction I had toward his brother. I just hoped New Mexico held the answers. </p> </body></html>"]
