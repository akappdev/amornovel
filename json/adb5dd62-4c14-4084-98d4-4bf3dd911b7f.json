A shiver racked me, and my thoughts shifted to my wife. My angel who slept peacefully in the apartment next door. I wanted her urgently \u0327 wanted to lose myself in her, and hated that I couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t hold her close. Couldn\u2019t pull her lush body under mine and sink into it, letting her touch chase the memories away.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I placed my palms flat against the cool tile and absorbed the chill of the punishing deluge into my bones. I was a selfish asshole.</p><p>If I\u2019d been a better man, I would\u2019ve walked away from Eva Cross the moment I saw her.</p><p>Instead, I\u2019d made her my wife. And I wanted the news of our marriage broadcast via every medium known to man, rather than hidden away as a secret between less than a handful of people. Worse, since I had no intention of letting her go, I would have to find a way to make up for the fact that I was such a fucking mess we couldn\u2019t even sleep in the same room together.</p><p>I lathered, quickly washing away the sticky sweat I\u2019d woken up in. Within minutes I was heading out to the bedroom, where I pulled on a pair of sweats before heading to my home office. It was just barely seven in the morning.</p><p>I\u2019d left the apartment Eva shared with her best friend, Cary Taylor, only a couple of hours earlier, wanting to give her time to catch a few hours of sleep before she headed into work. We had been at each other all night, both of us too needy and greedy. But there\u2019d been something else, too. An urgency on Eva\u2019s part that gnawed at me and left me uneasy.</p><p>Something was bothering my wife.</p> <p>My gaze drifted to the window and its view of Manhattan beyond it, then settled on the empty wall where photos of her and us hung in the same space in my penthouse office in our home on Fifth Avenue. I could imagine the collage clearly, having spent countless hours studying it over the last few months. Looking out at the city had once been the way I encapsulated my world. Now, I accomplished that by looking at Eva.</p><p>I sat at my desk and woke my computer with a shake of the mouse, taking a deep slow breath as my wife\u2019s face filled my monitor. She wore no makeup in the photo that was my desktop wallpaper, and a smattering of light freckles on her nose made her appear younger than her twenty-four years. My gaze slid over her features\u2014the curve of her brows, the brightness of her gray eyes, the fullness of her lips. In the moments when I let myself think of it, I could almost feel those lips against my skin. Her kisses were benedictions, promises from my angel that made my life worth living.</p><p>With a determined exhalation, I picked up the phone and speed-dialed Ra\u00fal Huerta. Despite the earliness of the hour, he answered swiftly and alertly.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cross and Cary Taylor are heading to San Diego today,\u201d I said, my hand curling into a fist at the thought. I didn\u2019t have to say more.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a recent photo of Anne Lucas and a detailed rundown of where she was last night on my desk by noon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the latest,\u201d he affirmed.</p><p>I hung up and stared at Eva\u2019s captivatingly beautiful face. I\u2019d caught her in a happy, unguarded moment, a state of being I was determined to keep her in for the rest of her life. But last night she\u2019d been distressed by a possible run-in with a woman I\u2019d once used. It had been a while since I\u2019d crossed paths with Anne, but if she was responsible for aggravating my wife, she\u2019d be seeing me again. Soon.</p> <p>Opening my inbox, I started sifting through my e-mails, drafting quick answers when required and working my way toward the subject line that had caught my eye the moment my e-mail opened.</p><p>I felt Eva before I saw her.</p><p>I lifted my head and my keystrokes slowed. A sudden rush of desire soothed the agitation I felt whenever I wasn\u2019t with her.</p><p>I leaned back to better appreciate the view. \u201cYou\u2019re up early, angel.\u201d</p><p>Eva stood in the doorway with her keys in hand, her blond hair in a sexy tangle around her shoulders, her cheeks and lips flushed from sleep, her curvy body clad in a tank top and shorts. She was braless, her lush tits swelling softly beneath the ribbed cotton. Petite and built to take a man to his knees, she often pointed out how different she was from the women I\u2019d been photographed with before her.</p><p>\u201cI woke up missing you,\u201d she replied, with the throaty voice that never failed to make me hard. \u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d I pushed the keyboard drawer in to make room for her on my desk.</p><p>She padded over on bare feet, effortlessly seducing me. The moment I first saw her I\u2019d known she would wreck me. The promise was there in her eyes and the way she moved. Everywhere she went, men stared at her. Coveted her. Just like I did.</p><p>I caught her by the waist when she came close enough, choosing to pull her onto my lap instead. Bending my head, I caught her nipple in my mouth, drawing on her with long, deep sucks. I heard her gasp, felt her body jolt at the sensation, and smiled inwardly. I could do whatever I wanted to her. She\u2019d given me that right. It was the greatest gift I had ever been given.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Her hands went to my hair, sifting through it.</p><p>I felt infinitely better already.</p><p>Lifting my head, I kissed her, tasting the cinnamon of her toothpaste and the underlying flavor that was uniquely her. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>She touched my face, her gaze searching. \u201cDid you have another nightmare?\u201d</p><p>I exhaled in a rush. She\u2019d always been able to see right through me. I wasn\u2019t sure I would ever get used to it.</p><p>I stroked the pad of my thumb over the damp cotton clinging to her nipple. \u201cI\u2019d rather talk about the wet dreams you\u2019re inspiring right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d</p><p>My lips thinned at her persistence. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it, angel.\u201d</p><p>Eva stiffened. \u201cI just want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to do that.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cSex fiend.\u201d</p><p>I cuddled her closer. I couldn\u2019t find the words to tell her how she felt in my arms, so I nuzzled her neck, breathing in the well-loved scent of her skin.</p><p>\u201cAce.\u201d</p><p>Something in the tone of her voice set me on edge. I pulled back slowly, my gaze gliding over her face. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout San Diego . . .\u201d Her eyes dropped and she caught her lower lip between her teeth.</p><p>I stilled, waiting to see where the conversation would go.</p><p>\u201cSix-Ninths is going to be there,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t tried to hide what I\u2019d already known, which was a relief. But a different kind of tension flooded me instead.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that\u2019s a problem.\u201d My voice remained steady, but I was anything but calm.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d she said softly. But her fingers were tangling restlessly in my hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She took a deep breath and then held my gaze. \u201cSomething\u2019s not right. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t get all icy and freeze me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me. Listening to my wife tell me she\u2019s confused over another man doesn\u2019t put me in a good mood.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed out of my lap and I let her, so I could watch her\u2014gauge her\u2014with some distance between us. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201d</p><p>I deliberately ignored the cold knot in my gut. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014\u201d Looking down, she chewed on her lower lip. \u201cThere\u2019s something . . . not finished.\u201d</p><p>My chest grew tight and hot. \u201cDoes he turn you on, Eva?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it the voice? The tattoos? His magic dick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. It\u2019s not easy talking about this. Don\u2019t make it harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s damned hard for me, too,\u201d I snapped, pushing to my feet.</p><p>I raked her from head to toe, wanting to fuck her and punish her at the same time. I wanted to tie her up, lock her up, safe from anyone who could threaten my grip on her. \u201cHe treated you like shit, Eva. Did seeing the \u2018Golden\u2019 video make you forget that? Is there something you need that I\u2019m not giving you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d Her arms crossed, a defensive pose that angered me further.</p><p>I needed her open and soft. I needed her completely. And there were times when I was maddened by how much she meant to me. She was the one thing I couldn\u2019t imagine losing. And she was saying the one thing I couldn\u2019t bear hearing.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t be ugly about this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being remarkably civilized, considering how violent I feel at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Guilt darkened her gray eyes, and then tears glistened.</p><p>I looked away. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>But she saw into me the way she always did.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d The diamond on her ring finger\u2014my claim to her\u2014caught the light and shot sparks of multihued fire against the wall. \u201cI hate that you\u2019re upset and pissed off at me. It hurts me, too, Gideon. I don\u2019t want him. I swear I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Restless, I went to the window, trying to find the calm I needed to deal with the danger Brett Kline presented. I\u2019d done everything I could. I had said the vows, slid the ring on her finger. Bound her to me in every way. Yet it still wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>The city spread out before me, the view obstructed by taller buildings. From the penthouse, I could see for miles. But from the Upper West Side apartment I\u2019d taken next door to Eva\u2019s, the vista was limited. I couldn\u2019t see the endless ribbons of streets clogged with yellow taxis or sunlight glinting off the many skyscraper windows.</p><p>I could give Eva New York. I could give her the world. I couldn\u2019t love her more than I did; it consumed me. And still, an asshole from her past was making strides on edging me out.</p><p>I remembered her in Kline\u2019s arms, kissing him with a desperation she should feel only for me. The possibility that lust for him might still affect her made me want to tear something apart.</p><p>My knuckles popped as my hands fisted. \u201cDo we need to take a break already? Take some time for Kline to clear up your confusion? Maybe I should do the same and help Corinne deal with hers.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a shaky breath at the mention of my former fianc\u00e9e. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>There was a terrible stretch of silence.</p><p>Then, \u201cCongratulations, dickhead. You just hurt me worse than he ever did.\u201d</p><p>I turned in time to see her stalking out of the room, her back rigid and tense. The keys she\u2019d used to let herself in were left on my desk, and the sight of them abandoned triggered something desperate. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>I caught her and she struggled, the dynamic between us so familiar\u2014Eva running, me chasing.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed and I pressed my face against her. \u201cI won\u2019t let him have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so mad at you right now, I could hit you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted her to. Wanted the pain. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>She clawed at my forearms. \u201cPut me down, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I turned her around and pinned her to the hallway wall. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do when you tell me you\u2019re confused about Brett Kline? I feel like I\u2019m hanging on the edge of a cliff and my grip is slipping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tear at me to hold on? Why don\u2019t you get that I\u2019m not going anywhere?\u201d</p><p>I stared down at her, scrambling for something to say that would make things right between us. Her lower lip began to quiver and I . . . I unraveled.</p><p>\u201cTell me how to handle this,\u201d I said hoarsely, circling her wrists and exerting gentle pressure. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandle me, you mean?\u201d Her shoulders went back. \u201cBecause I\u2019m what\u2019s wrong here. I knew Brett during a time in my life when I hated myself but wanted other people to love me. And now he\u2019s acting the way I wanted him to back then and it\u2019s giving me a head trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Eva.\u201d I pressed harder, flattening my body against her. \u201cHow am I not supposed to feel threatened by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to trust me. I told you because I didn\u2019t want you to get weird vibes and jump to conclusions. I wanted to be honest about it so you wouldn\u2019t feel threatened. I know I\u2019ve got some stuff to work out in my head. I\u2019m going to see Dr. Travis this weekend and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShrinks aren\u2019t a cure-all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t yell at me.\u201d</p><p>I fought the urge to slam my fist into the plaster behind her. My wife\u2019s blind faith in the healing properties of therapy frustrated the hell out of me. \u201cWe\u2019re not running to a damned doctor every time we\u2019ve got a problem. It\u2019s you and me in this marriage. Not the goddamned psychiatric community!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her chin lifted, her jaw taking on the determined slant that drove me crazy. She never gave me an inch unless my cock was inside her. Then she gave me everything.</p><p>\u201cYou may think you don\u2019t need help, ace, but I know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I need is you.\u201d I cupped her head in my heads. \u201cI need my wife. And I need her thinking about me and not some other guy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me wish I hadn\u2019t said anything.\u201d</p> <p>My lip curled in a sneer. \u201cI knew how you felt. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. You jealous, crazy . . .\u201d She moaned softly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you understand how much I love you? Brett\u2019s got nothing on you. Nothing. But honestly, I don\u2019t want to be around you right now.\u201d</p><p>I felt her resistance, the pushback of her trying to get away. I clutched her like a lifeline. \u201cCan\u2019t you see what you\u2019re doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Eva softened in my arms. \u201cI don\u2019t get you, Gideon. How can you just flip a switch and turn your feelings off? Knowing how I feel about Corinne, how could you throw her in my face like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the reason I breathe, I can\u2019t turn it off.\u201d I slid my mouth across her cheek. \u201cI think of nothing but you. All day. Every day. Everything I do, I do with you in mind. There\u2019s no room for anyone else. It kills me that you have room for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay the hell away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s avoidance, not a solution.\u201d Her fingers dug into my waist. \u201cI\u2019m broken, Gideon, you know that. I\u2019m piecing myself back together.\u201d</p><p>I loved her just the way she was. Why wasn\u2019t that enough?</p><p>\u201cThanks to you I\u2019m stronger than I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut there are still cracks, and when I find them, I have to figure out what made them and how to seal them up. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck does that mean?\u201d My hands pushed beneath her top, seeking her bare skin.</p> <p>She stiffened and pushed at me, rejecting me. \u201cGideon, no . . .\u201d</p><p>I sealed my mouth over hers. Lifting her off her feet, I took her to the floor. She struggled and I growled, \u201cDon\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just screw our problems away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to screw you.\u201d My thumbs hooked into the waistband of her shorts and shoved them down. I was frantic to be in her, possessing her, feeling her surrender. Anything to drown out the voice in my head telling me I\u2019d fucked up. Again. And this time, I wouldn\u2019t be forgiven.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d She rolled onto her stomach.</p><p>My arms banded around her hips when she tried to crawl away. She could throw me off as she\u2019d been trained to and she could cut me off with a word. Her safe word . . .</p><p>\u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>Eva froze at the sound of my voice and the one word meant to convey the riot of emotions she shattered me with.</p> <p>It was in that eye of the storm that something snapped. A fierce and familiar quiet exploded within me, silencing the panic shaking my confidence. I stilled, absorbing the sudden absence of turmoil. It had been a long time since I\u2019d last felt the dizzying switch between chaos and control. Only Eva could rock me so deeply, sending me hurtling back to a time when I\u2019d been at the mercy of everything and everyone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stop fighting me,\u201d I told her calmly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to apologize.\u201d</p><p>She went lax in my arms. Her submission was total and swift. I had the upper hand again.</p><p>I pulled her up and back, so that she was sitting on my thighs. Eva needed me in control. When I was reeling, she scattered, which only shook me more. It was a vicious cycle and I had to get a better grip on it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sorry for hurting her. Sorry for losing my command of the situation. I\u2019d been edgy after the nightmare\u2014something she\u2019d intuited\u2014and getting hit with Kline immediately after hadn\u2019t given me time to get my shit together.</p><p>I would deal with him. I\u2019d keep a tight grasp on her. Period. There were no other options.</p><p>\u201cI need your support, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to tell him you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her temple against my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m going to.\u201d</p><p>I shifted her to sit across my lap and leaned back against the wall, cradling her close. Her arms wrapped around my neck and my world righted itself again.</p><p>Her hand slid down my chest. \u201cAce . . .\u201d</p><p>The coaxing note in her voice was one I knew well. I was hard in an instant, my blood hot and thick. Submitting to me turned Eva on, and that reaction from her fired me up like nothing else.</p><p>I pushed my hand into her hair and fisted the soft gold strands, watching the way her eyes grew heavy-lidded at the feel of the gentle tug. She was restrained and at my mercy, and she loved it. Needed it, just as much as I did.</p><p>I took her mouth.</p><p>Then I took her.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>WHILE Angus drove Eva and me to work, I scrolled through my appointment calendar and thought of my wife\u2019s eight-thirty flight.</p><p>I glanced at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll take one of the jets to California.\u201d</p><p>She had been looking out the window of the Bentley, city-scoping with her usual eager interest. She turned her gaze to me.</p><p>I was born in New York. I\u2019d grown up in and near the city and eventually began to make it my own. At some point, I\u2019d stopped noticing it. But Eva\u2019s fascination and delight with my hometown had reintroduced it to me. I didn\u2019t study the city with the intensity she did, but I saw it with fresh eyes all the same.</p><p>\u201cWill I?\u201d she challenged, her eyes betraying her countering attraction to me.</p><p>Her fuck-me look kept me redlined constantly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I closed my tablet case. \u201cIt\u2019s faster, more comfortable, and safer.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>That hint of teasing amusement captivated me, made me want to do everything wicked and raw to her until only complete surrender remained.</p><p>\u201cYou get to tell Cary,\u201d she went on, switching the cross of her legs and revealing the lacy edge of her stockings and a peek of her garter.</p><p>She was wearing a red sleeveless shirt and a white skirt with strappy heels. A perfectly acceptable businesslike outfit that was elevated by the body inside it to understated sexiness. Electricity arced between us, the instinctive recognition that we had been made to fit together perfectly.</p><p>\u201cAsk me to come with you,\u201d I said, hating the thought of her being away from me for an entire weekend.</p><p>Her smile faded. \u201cI can\u2019t. If I\u2019m going to start telling people we\u2019re married, I have to start with Cary, and I can\u2019t do that with you around. I don\u2019t want him to feel like he\u2019s on the outside of a life I\u2019m creating with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be on the outside, either.\u201d</p><p>She linked her fingers with mine. \u201cSpending private time with friends doesn\u2019t make us any less of a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to spend time with you. You\u2019re the most interesting person I know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she stared at me. Then she exploded into movement, hitching up her skirt and straddling me before I realized what she was doing. Cupping my face in her hands, she pressed her gloss-slick lips to mine and kissed me senseless.</p><p>\u201cUmm,\u201d I moaned, as she pulled away breathlessly. My fingers flexed into the generous curve of her gorgeous ass. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hot for you right now,\u201d she breathed, rubbing my lips clean with her thumb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good with that.\u201d</p><p>Her husky laugh slid all around me. \u201cI feel so awesome right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than you did in the hallway?\u201d Her joy was infectious. If I could\u2019ve stopped time, I would have at that moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a different kind of awesome.\u201d Her fingertips tap-danced on my shoulders. She was . . . radiant when she was happy, and her pleasure brightened everything around her. Even me. \u201cThat was the best compliment, ace. Especially coming from the Gideon Cross. You meet fascinating people every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wish they\u2019d go away so I can get back to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glistened. \u201cGod, I love you so much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>My hands shook and I dug them into the backs of her thighs to hide it from her. My gaze wandered, trying to latch on to something that would anchor me.</p><p>If she only knew what she did to me with those three little words.</p><p>She hugged me. \u201cI want you to do something for me,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnything. Everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a party.\u201d</p><p>Seizing the opportunity to move on to other topics . . . \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll set up the swing.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, Eva shoved at my shoulder. \u201cNot that kind of party, fiend.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a wicked smile. \u201cHow about I promise the swing in return for the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now we\u2019re talking.\u201d I settled back, enjoying her immensely. \u201cTell me what you have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBooze and friends, yours and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I considered the possibilities. \u201cI\u2019ll see you your booze and friends, and raise you a quickie in a dark corner somewhere during.\u201d</p><p>Her throat worked on a quick swallow and I smiled inwardly. I knew my angel well. Indulging her closet exhibitionism was a complete 360 turnaround for me, and though it still amazed me when I thought about it, I didn\u2019t mind in the least. There was nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for those moments when the only thing that mattered to her was being filled with my cock.</p><p>\u201cYou drive a hard bargain,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cExactly my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll see you your quickie and raise you a hand job under the table.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. \u201cClothed,\u201d I countered.</p><p>Something that sounded like a purr rumbled in the air between us. \u201cI think you need to revisit and revise, Mr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll need to work harder to convince me, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>She was, as always, the most invigorating negotiation of my day.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>WE separated on the twentieth floor, where she exited the elevator into the Waters Field &amp; Leaman foyer. I was determined to get her on my team and working for me. It was an objective I strategized every day.</p><p>When I reached my office, my assistant was already at his desk.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Scott greeted me, standing as I approached. \u201cPR called a few minutes ago. They\u2019re fielding an unusual amount of inquiries about a rumored engagement between you and Miss Tramell. They\u2019d like to know how to respond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should confirm.\u201d I passed him and went to the coatrack in the corner behind my desk.</p><p>He followed. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I shrugged out of my jacket and slung it on a hook. When I glanced at him again, he was grinning.</p><p>Scott Reid handled myriad tasks for me with quiet care, which led others to often underestimate him and allow him to go unnoticed. On more than one occasion, his detailed observations of individuals had proven extremely insightful, and so I overpaid him for his position to keep him from going anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tramell and I will marry before the end of the year,\u201d I told him. \u201cAll interview and photo requests for either of us should be routed through Cross Industries. And tell security downstairs the same. No one should get to her without going through me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let them know. Also, Mr. Madani wanted to be notified when you got in. He\u2019d like a few minutes with you before the meeting this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready when he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Arash Madani said, walking in. \u201cThere used to be days when you were here before seven. You\u2019re slacking off, Cross.\u201d</p><p>I shot the lawyer a warning look that carried no heat. Arash lived to work and was damned good at it, which is why I hired him away from his former employer. He\u2019d been the toughest counsel I had ever run across, and in the years since, that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>Gesturing at one of the two chairs in front of my desk, I took my seat and watched him take his. His dark blue suit was simple but bespoke, his wavy black hair tamed by a precision cut. Sharp intelligence marked his dark brown eyes, extending to a smile that was more warning than greeting. He was a friend as well as an employee, and I valued his lack of bullshit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve received a respectable bid on the property on Thirty-sixth,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d A tangle of emotions held my reply for a moment. The hotel Eva hated remained a problem as long as I owned it. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s curious,\u201d he shot back, setting one ankle on the opposite knee, \u201cconsidering how slowly the market\u2019s recovering. I had to dig through several layers, but the bidder is a subsidiary of LanCorp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky. Landon knows the next highest bid is a ways off\u2014about ten million ways. I recommend we pull the property off the market and revisit in a year or two.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sitting back, I waved away the suggestion. \u201cLet him have it.\u201d</p><p>Arash blinked. \u201cAre you shitting me? Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of that hotel?\u201d</p><p>Because I can\u2019t keep it in my holdings without hurting my wife. \u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said when I advised you to sell it a few years ago and you chose to sink millions in renovations into it instead. An expense that you\u2019re just finally breaking even on, and now you want to offload it in a still-shaky market to a guy who wants your head?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never a bad time to sell real estate in Manhattan.\u201d And certainly, never a bad time to dump something Eva called my \u201cfuck pad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are better times, and you know it. Landon knows it. You sell to him, you\u2019ll only be encouraging him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Maybe he\u2019ll up his game.\u201d</p><p>Ryan Landon had an ax to grind; I didn\u2019t hold it against him. My father had decimated the Landon fortune and Ryan wanted a Cross to pay for that. He wasn\u2019t the first or last businessman to come after me because of my father, but he was the most tenacious. And he was young enough to have plenty of time to dedicate to the task.</p><p>I looked at the photo of Eva on my desk. All other considerations were secondary.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Arash said, lifting his hands in mock surrender, \u201cit\u2019s your business. I just need to know if the rules have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that, Cross, you\u2019re further out of the game than I thought. While Landon\u2019s plotting your ruin, you\u2019re off at the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop kicking my ass for taking a weekend off, Arash.\u201d I\u2019d do it again in an instant. Those days I\u2019d spent with Eva in the Outer Banks had been every fucking dream I\u2019d never allowed myself to have.</p><p>I stood and walked to the window. LanCorp\u2019s offices were in the high-rise two blocks over, and Ryan Landon\u2019s office had a prime view of the Crossfire Building. I suspected he spent more than a few moments every day staring at my office and planning his next move. Occasionally, I stared back and dared him to bring it harder.</p><p>My father was a criminal who\u2019d destroyed countless lives. He was also the man who\u2019d taught me how to ride a bike and to sign my name with pride. I couldn\u2019t save Geoffrey Cross\u2019s reputation, but I could damn sure protect what I\u2019d built out of his ashes.</p> <p>Arash joined me at the window. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I wouldn\u2019t hole up with a babe like Eva Tramell if I could. But I\u2019d have my goddamn cell phone with me. Especially in the middle of a high-stakes negotiation.\u201d</p><p>Remembering how melted chocolate tasted on Eva\u2019s skin, I thought a hurricane could\u2019ve been ripping shingles off the roof and I wouldn\u2019t have given it a second\u2019s attention. \u201cYou\u2019re making me pity you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanCorp\u2019s acquisition of that software set you back years in research and development. And it\u2019s made him cocky.\u201d</p><p>That was what really got Arash\u2019s blood up, Landon\u2019s pleasure in his own success. \u201cThat software\u2019s next to worthless without PosIT\u2019s hardware.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgenda item number three.\u201d</p><p>He faced me. \u201cIt said To Be Determined on my copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it says PosIT on my mine. That game enough for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>My desk phone beeped, followed by Scott\u2019s voice projecting from the speaker. \u201cA couple things, Mr. Cross. Miss Tramell is on line one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Scott.\u201d I headed for the receiver with the thrill of the hunt coursing through my blood. If we acquired PosIT, Landon would be back to square one. \u201cWhen I\u2019m clear, I need Victor Reyes on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Also, Mrs. Vidal is at reception,\u201d he went on, stopping me in my tracks. \u201cWould you like me to postpone the morning meeting?\u201d</p><p>I looked out the glass partition that divided my office from the rest of the floor, even though I couldn\u2019t see my mother from that distance. My hands clenched at my sides. According to the clock on my phone, I had ten minutes to spare and my wife on the line. The urge was there to make my mother wait until I could fit her in my schedule, not hers, but I shoved it down.</p><p>\u201cBuy me twenty minutes,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ll take the calls with Miss Tramell and Reyes, then you can bring Mrs. Vidal back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>I waited a beat. Then I picked up the phone and hit the rapidly blinking button.</p><p>2</p><p>\u201cANGEL.\u201d</p><p>The impact of Gideon\u2019s voice on my senses was as hard-hitting as it had been the first time I\u2019d heard it. Cultured yet smoky with sensuality, it knocked me for a loop both in the darkness of my bedroom and over the phone, where I couldn\u2019t be distracted by that incomparably gorgeous face of his.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I slid my swivel chair a little closer to my desk. \u201cIs it a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice didn\u2019t hit me right. \u201cI can call back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d The authoritative bite when he said my name had my toes flexing in my nude sling-back Louboutins. \u201cSay what you need.\u201d</p><p>You, I almost said, which was more than a little insane considering he\u2019d just fucked my brains out only a couple hours before. After he\u2019d fucked my brains out damn near all night long.</p><p>Instead, I told him, \u201cI need a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll enjoy the payback.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension left my shoulders. He\u2019d hurt me by mentioning Corinne the way he had, and the argument that followed was still fresh in my mind. But I had to push it aside, let it go. \u201cDoes security have the home addresses of everyone who works in the Crossfire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have copies of IDs. Tell me why you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe receptionist here at work is a friend of mine and she\u2019s been out sick all week. I\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hoping to head over to her place and check up on her, you should get the address from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if she\u2019d return my calls.\u201d I ran my fingertip around the lip of my coffee mug and stared at the collage of pictures of Gideon and me that decorated my desk.</p><p>\u201cAre you not on speaking terms at the moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not fighting or anything. It\u2019s just not like her to not get in touch with me, especially when she\u2019s calling in sick to work every day. She\u2019s a chatty girl, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>If it had been any other guy who\u2019d said that, I would think he was being sarcastic. But not Gideon. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever really talked with women in any meaningful way. He was too often clueless when interacting with me, as if his social development hadn\u2019t quite been well rounded when it came to dealing with the opposite sex.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to take my word for it, ace. I just . . . I want to make sure she\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lawyer\u2019s standing right here, but I don\u2019t have to ask him about the legality of giving you the information you\u2019re asking for via the means you\u2019ve suggested. Call Ra\u00fal. He\u2019ll find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d An image of the dark-haired, dark-eyed security specialist ran through my mind. \u201cIs he going to be okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, he\u2019s paid to be okay with everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I fiddled with my pen. I knew I shouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable using Gideon\u2019s resources, but it made me feel as if our relationship were unbalanced in his favor. While I didn\u2019t believe he would ever hold that over me, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d see me as equal to him, either, and that was really important to me.</p><p>He had already taken care of issues on his own that I should\u2019ve been a part of. Like Sam Yimara\u2019s horrid sex tape of Brett and me. And Nathan.</p><p>Still, I asked, \u201cHow do I reach him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text you his number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want either myself, Angus, or Ra\u00fal with you when you go see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that wouldn\u2019t be awkward at all.\u201d I glanced at Mark\u2019s office to make sure my boss didn\u2019t need me for anything. I tried not to make personal calls at work, but Megumi had been out for four days straight without a single returned call or text the whole time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw me that \u2018chicks before dicks\u2019 line, Eva. You need to give me something here.\u201d</p><p>I got the subtext. He was worried about me going to San Diego and was letting that issue slide. I had to bend a little somewhere else in return. \u201cOkay, okay. If she\u2019s not back in the office on Monday, we\u2019ll figure out how to handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s it.\u201d My gaze returned to a photo of him and my heart hurt just a little, the way it always did when I looked at him. \u201cThank you. I hope you have an amazing day. I love you madly, you know. And no, I don\u2019t expect you to say it back while your lawyer\u2019s hanging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d There was an aching note in his voice that moved me more than words ever could. \u201cCome see me when you get off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Don\u2019t forget to call Cary about taking your jet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and sat back in my chair.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I swiveled to face Christine Field, the executive chairman. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to congratulate you again on your engagement.\u201d Her gaze went past my shoulder to the framed photos behind me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I hadn\u2019t realized you and Gideon Cross were dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I try not to talk about my personal life at work.\u201d</p><p>I made the statement casually, because I didn\u2019t want to antagonize one of the partners. Still, I hoped she got the hint. Gideon was the center of my life, but I needed some parts of it to belong only to me.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good! But just goes to show that I\u2019m not keeping my ear close enough to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019re missing anything important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you the reason Cross approached us with the Kingsman campaign?\u201d</p><p>I winced inwardly. Of course she\u2019d think I would recommend my employer to my boyfriend, because she\u2019d assume Gideon and I had been dating at least long enough to make an engagement plausible. Telling her I had been with Waters Field &amp; Leaman longer than I\u2019d been with Gideon, when I had been employed there only a couple of months, would open up speculation I didn\u2019t want floating around.</p><p>Worse, I was pretty certain Gideon had used the vodka campaign as an excuse to draw me into his world on his terms. That didn\u2019t mean Mark hadn\u2019t done a phenomenal job on the request for proposal. I didn\u2019t want my relationship with Gideon to shift any of the focus away from my boss and his accomplishments.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross approached the agency on his own,\u201d I replied, sticking to the truth. \u201cWhich was a great decision. Mark rocked that RFP.\u201d</p><p>Christine nodded. \u201cHe did. All right. I\u2019ll let you get back to work. Mark\u2019s been singing your praises, too, by the way. We\u2019re glad to have you on our team.\u201d</p><p>I managed a smile, but my day was off to a rocky start. First, Gideon knocked me sideways with his Corinne bullshit. Then, finding Megumi still out sick. Now, I\u2019d rolled into being treated differently at work because my name was connected to Gideon\u2019s in a significant way.</p><p>Opening my inbox, I started going through the morning\u2019s e-mail. I understood that Gideon wanted to make me feel what he was feeling, so he\u2019d leveraged Corinne against me. I\u2019d known talking about Brett was going to be a problem, which was why I\u2019d put it off, but I hadn\u2019t had an ulterior motive in bringing it up or when I\u2019d kissed Brett, either. I had hurt Gideon, yes, but could sincerely say I hadn\u2019t consciously intended to do so.</p><p>On the flip side, Gideon had deliberately set out to hurt me. I hadn\u2019t realized he was capable of that or willing to do it. Something important had shifted between us that morning. I felt as if a core column of trust had been shaken.</p><p>Did he know that? Did he understand how big a problem that was?</p><p>My desk phone rang and I answered with my usual greeting.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you going to wait to tell me about your engagement?\u201d</p><p>A sigh escaped me before I could hold it back. My Friday really was shaping up to be a trial. \u201cHi, Mom. I was going to call you during my lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew last night!\u201d she accused. \u201cDid he ask you on the way to dinner? Because you didn\u2019t say anything about a proposal when we talked about him asking your father and Richard for permission. I saw the ring at Cipriani\u2019s and was pretty sure, but when you didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t push because you\u2019ve been so touchy lately.

I mean, really, Eva. No mother should find out on the Internet that her daughter is getting married!\u201d</p> <p>I stared at my monitor blankly, my heart rate kicking up. \u201cWhat? Where on the Internet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your pick! Page Six, HuffPost . . . And let me tell you again, there is no way I can pull together a proper wedding before the end of the year!\u201d</p><p>My daily Google alert hadn\u2019t hit my inbox yet, so I did a quick search, typing so quickly I spelled my own name wrong. It didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Socialite Eva Tramell has nabbed the brass ring. Not literally, of course. Multibillionaire entrepreneur Gideon Cross, whose name is synonymous with excess and luxury, wouldn\u2019t slide anything less than platinum onto the finger of the woman who\u2019ll bear his name. (see photo at left) A source at Cross Industries confirmed the significance of the giant rock on Tramell\u2019s left hand. No comment was made regarding the ring Cross has been seen wearing. (see photo at right) A wedding is planned before year\u2019s end. We have to wonder what the rush is. Operation Gideva Baby Bump Watch has commenced.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I breathed, horrified. \u201cI have to go. I have to call Dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEva! You need to come over after work. We have to talk about the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully my dad was on the West Coast, which bought me at least three hours, depending on his work schedule. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to San Diego this weekend with Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to put off any travel for a while. You need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart without me, Mom,\u201d I said desperately, glancing at the clock. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything specific in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be seri\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta go. Have to work.\u201d I hung up, then pulled open the desk drawer that held my smartphone.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d Mark Garrity leaned over the top of my cubicle and offered me one of his charming crooked smiles. \u201cReady to roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d My finger hovered over the home button on my phone. I was torn between doing what I was paid to do\u2014work\u2014and making sure my dad heard about the engagement from me. Usually, it wouldn\u2019t be a dilemma at all to choose. I loved my job too much to risk it by slacking off. But my dad had been in a funk since he\u2019d messed around with my mom and I was worried about him. He wasn\u2019t the kind of guy to take sleeping with a married woman lightly, even one he was in love with.</p><p>I put the phone back in the drawer. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I replied, pushing back from my desk and grabbing my tablet.</p><p>When I settled into my usual seat in front of Mark\u2019s desk, I sent my dad a quick text from my tablet saying I had something important to share with him and that I\u2019d call at noon.</p><p>It was the best I could do. I could only hope it was enough.</p><p>3</p><p>\u201cMAN, YOU ARE smooth.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Arash after setting the receiver back in its cradle. \u201cAre you still here?\u201d</p> <p>The attorney laughed and settled back in his seat on my office sofa. The view wasn\u2019t nearly as pleasant as the one my wife had given me not too long ago.</p><p>\u201cSchmoozing the father-in-law,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m impressed. I expect Eva will be impressed, too. Bet you\u2019re counting on that heading into the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Damn right. I would need all the points I could earn when I met up with Eva in San Diego. \u201cShe\u2019s about to go out of town. And you have to head into the conference room before they get too restless in there. I\u2019ll join you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>He stood. \u201cYes, I heard. Your mother\u2019s here. Let the wedding insanity begin. Since you\u2019re free this weekend, how about we round up some of the usual suspects at my place tonight? It\u2019s been a while, and your bachelor days are numbered. Well, technically they\u2019re over, but no one else knows that.\u201d</p><p>And he was bound by attorney-client privilege.</p><p>It took me a beat to decide. \u201cAll right. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight-ish.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then caught Scott\u2019s eye. He got the message and rounded his desk to head up to reception.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Arash grinned. \u201cSee you at the meeting.\u201d</p><p>During the two minutes I had alone, I texted Angus about getting to California. I still had unfinished business there, and taking care of it while Eva was visiting her dad gave me a legitimate excuse to be where she was. Not that I absolutely needed one.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>As my mother entered, my fingers curled into my palms.</p><p>Scott followed and asked, \u201cAre you sure I can\u2019t get you something, Mrs. Vidal? Coffee, maybe? Or water?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He smiled and left, pulling the door closed behind him.</p><p>I hit the remote on my desk that controlled the opacity of the glass wall, blocking the view from everyone on the main floor. My mother approached, looking slim and elegant in dark blue slacks and white blouse. She\u2019d pulled her hair back into a sleek ebony bun, showing off the flawless face that my father had adored. Once, I\u2019d adored it, too. Now, I had trouble looking at her.</p><p>And since we looked so much alike, I sometimes had trouble looking at myself.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mother. What brings you into the city?\u201d</p><p>She set her purse on the edge of my desk. \u201cWhy is Eva wearing my ring?\u201d</p><p>The small pleasure I\u2019d felt at seeing her dissipated instantly. \u201cIt\u2019s my ring. And the answer to your question is obvious: She\u2019s wearing the ring because I gave it to her when I proposed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She pulled her shoulders back. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into with her.\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to remain facing her. I hated when she looked at me with hurt in her eyes. Blue eyes that were so like mine. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I\u2019ve put an important meeting on hold to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to come to your office if you\u2019d answer my calls or come home once in a while!\u201d Her pretty pink mouth tightened with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cThat is not my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s using you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I retrieved my coat. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms across her chest like a shield. I knew my mother; she was just getting started. \u201cShe\u2019s involved with that singer, Brett Kline. Did you know that? And she\u2019s got an ugly side you\u2019ve never seen. She was downright vicious to me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak with her.\u201d Straightening my coat with a brisk tug on the lapels, I headed toward the door. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be wasting her time.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s breath caught. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little too late for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She took a shaky step back from the look I gave her. \u201cI know Geoffrey\u2019s death was hard on you. It was a difficult time for all of us. I tried to give you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this here!\u201d I snapped, furious that she would bring up something as personal as my father\u2019s suicide while I was working. That she would bring it up at all. \u201cYou\u2019ve hijacked my morning and pissed me off. Let me make it clear to you. There is no scenario pitting you against Eva where you come out on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could say that would affect anything. If she wanted my money, I\u2019d give her every cent. If she wanted another man, I\u2019d make her forget him.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an unsteady hand to her hair, smoothing it although not a single glossy strand was out of place. \u201cI only want the best for you, and she\u2019s stirring up crap that has been put away a long time. It can\u2019t be a healthy relationship for you. She\u2019s creating a rift with your family that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been estranged, Mother. Eva has nothing to do with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it to be like this!\u201d Stepping closer, she held out her hand. A strand of black pearls peeked out from between the lapels of her blouse, and a sapphire-faced Patek Philippe adorned her wrist. She hadn\u2019t rebooted her life after my father\u2019s death; she\u2019d done a complete wipe and restart. And never looked back. \u201cI miss you. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Gideon. You won\u2019t give me a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need a ride, Angus is at your service.\u201d I caught the handle of the door and paused. \u201cDon\u2019t come here again, Mother. I don\u2019t like arguing with you. It would be best for both of us if you just stay away.\u201d</p><p>I left the door open behind me and headed toward the conference room.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cYOU took this shot today?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Ra\u00fal, who stood in front of my desk. Dressed in a plain black suit, he had the steady, watchful gaze of a man who made his living by seeing and hearing everything.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cNot more than an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>I returned my attention to the photo in front of me. It was difficult looking at Anne Lucas. The sight of her foxlike face, with its sharp chin and sharper eyes, brought back memories I wished I could erase from my mind. Not just of her, but of her brother, who\u2019d been similar in ways that made my skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cEva said the woman had long hair,\u201d I murmured, noting that Anne still had cropped hair. I remembered the plastic feel of it, the sharp-gelled spikes scratching my thighs as she deep-throated my cock, working desperately to get me hard enough to fuck her.</p><p>I handed the tablet back to Ra\u00fal. \u201cFind out who it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Eva call you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cNo.\u201d But he pulled out his smartphone and checked it. \u201cNo,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cShe may wait until you fly out to San Diego. She wants you to find a friend of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of her,\u201d I said, holding his gaze.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t need to be said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>As he left my office, I sat back in my chair. There were a number of women in my past who might cause problems for me with my wife. The women I\u2019d slept with were aggressive by nature, ones who put me in the position of needing to take the upper hand. Eva was the only woman who\u2019d ever grabbed the lead and made me want more.</p><p>It was getting harder to let her be away from me, not easier.</p><p>\u201cThe team from Envoy is here,\u201d Scott said through the speaker.</p><p>\u201cSend them in.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I powered through my day, wrapping up the week\u2019s agenda and laying the groundwork for more to come. There was a lot I needed to get off my plate before I could take time off with Eva. Our daylong honeymoon had been perfect, but far too short. I wanted at least two weeks away with her, preferably a month. Someplace far away from work and other commitments, where I could have her all to myself with no interruptions.</p><p>My smartphone vibrated on my desktop and I looked at it, surprised to see my sister\u2019s face on the screen. I\u2019d texted Ireland earlier to let her know about the engagement. Her reply had been a short and simple, Yay! Stoked. Congrats, bro!</p><p>I\u2019d barely answered the call with a quick hello when she cut me off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking excited!\u201d she yelled, forcing me to pull the phone away from my ear.</p><p>\u201cWatch the mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m seventeen, not seven. This is so awesome. I\u2019ve wanted a sister forever, but figured I\u2019d be old and gray before you and Christopher stopped bouncing around and settled down.\u201d</p><p>I sat back in my chair. \u201cI live to serve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Yeah, right. You done good, you know. Eva\u2019s a keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to her, I get to harass you now. Always a highlight of my day.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened, forcing me to take a minute before I could reply in an easy tone of voice. \u201cOddly enough, it\u2019s a highlight of mine as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah. It should be.\u201d Her voice lowered. \u201cI heard Mom losing her shit over it earlier. She told Dad she went to your work and you guys got in a fight or something. I think she\u2019s kinda jealous. She\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It just sucks that she couldn\u2019t keep it together today of all days. Anyway, I\u2019m thrilled and wanted you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to be the flower girl. I\u2019m too old for that. I\u2019m up for being a bridesmaid, though. Even a groomswoman or whatever. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d My mouth curved. \u201cI\u2019ll pass that along to Eva.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d just hung up when Scott buzzed through my office line.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tramell is here,\u201d he announced, making me realize how late in the day it was. \u201cAnd, as a reminder, your videoconference with the development team in California is in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Pushing back from the desk, I saw Eva round the corner and come into view. I could watch her walk for hours. She had a sway to her hips that made me ache to fuck her and a determined tilt to her chin that challenged every dominant instinct I had.</p><p>I wanted to fist her ponytail in my hand, take her mouth, and grind against her. Just the way I\u2019d wanted to the first time I saw her. And every time since.</p><p>\u201cSend along the proposal deck to the team,\u201d I told Scott. \u201cTell them to review and I\u2019ll join in shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Eva swept through the door.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d I stood. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>She rounded the desk, then grabbed me by the tie.</p><p>I was instantly hard and totally focused on her.</p><p>\u201cI fucking love you,\u201d she said, before yanking my mouth down to meet hers.</p><p>I hooked one arm around her waist and felt around for the opacity controls with my other hand, all the while letting her kiss me as if she owned me. Which she did. Absolutely.</p><p>The feel of her lips against mine and the unmistakable possessiveness of her actions were exactly what I needed after the day I\u2019d had. Holding her close, I turned and half-sat on the edge of the desk, pulling her in between my thighs. I could say it was a more secure way to hold her, but honestly, my knees were weak.</p><p>Her kisses did that to me. Did what three hours of sparring with my trainer couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Inhaling through the rising lust, I breathed her in, allowing the delicate fragrance of her perfume and the provocative scent that was hers alone to intoxicate me. Her lips were soft and damp against mine, demanding in the subtlest of ways. Her tongue licked delicately, savoring, teasing and arousing me effortlessly.</p><p>Eva kissed me as if I were the most delicious thing she\u2019d ever tasted, a flavor she craved and was helplessly addicted to. The feeling was heady and had become necessary. I lived for her kisses.</p><p>When she kissed me, I knew I belonged right where I was.</p><p>Tilting her head, she moaned into my mouth, a soft sound of pleasure and surrender. Her fingers were in my hair, sliding through it, tugging it. That sensation of being caught\u2014claimed\u2014challenged me on the deepest level. I drew her closer, until the firmness of her belly pressed against the hardness of my erection.</p><p>My dick was throbbing, aching.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make me come,\u201d I murmured. All the effort I\u2019d once had to expend to become aroused enough to orgasm was unnecessary with my wife. The fact that she existed stirred my blood. The strength of her desire was enough to set me off.</p><p>She leaned back slightly, breathless like me. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, either, if I didn\u2019t have a meeting waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hold you up. I just want to thank you for what you said to my dad.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling, I gave her ass a two-handed squeeze. \u201cMy lawyer said I\u2019d score major points for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork was so busy, and I didn\u2019t have a chance to call him until lunch. I was so worried he\u2019d hear about our engagement before I could tell him.\u201d She shoved at my shoulder. \u201cYou could\u2019ve given me a heads-up that you were announcing it to the world!\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned, but I wasn\u2019t going to deny it when asked.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted wryly. \u201cOf course not. Did you see that ridiculous post about a baby bump?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA frightening thought at this point,\u201d I said, trying to keep my tone light despite the sudden rush of alarm I felt. \u201cI\u2019m planning on keeping you all to myself for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI was freaked out that my dad would think I was engaged and pregnant, and just couldn\u2019t be bothered to let him know. It was such a relief to call him and find out you\u2019d explained everything and smoothed the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d I would set the world on fire to clear a path for her, if that\u2019s what it took.</p><p>Her hands went to work unbuttoning my vest. My brows arched in silent query, but I wasn\u2019t going to stop her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even left yet, and I\u2019m missing you already,\u201d she said quietly, straightening my tie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were just going to hole up with Cary for a bit, I\u2019d do it here at home and not in San Diego.\u201d She lifted her gaze to my face. \u201cBut he\u2019s a head case over Tatiana being pregnant. Plus, I need to spend time with my dad. Especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something you should be telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He sounded good when I talked to him, but I think he was hoping we\u2019d have more time together before I got married. To him, it seems like you and I just met.\u201d</p><p>I knew I should keep my mouth shut, but I couldn\u2019t. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t forget Kline.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw hardened. She dropped her attention back to where her fingers were buttoning my vest. \u201cI\u2019m leaving soon. I don\u2019t want to fight again.\u201d</p><p>I caught her hands. \u201cEva. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Staring into her stormy eyes, I felt the tug in my chest: a slow wrenching that could turn me upside down. She hadn\u2019t stopped being angry with me, and I couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cYou still don\u2019t understand what you do to me. How crazy you make me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that. You shouldn\u2019t have brought up Corinne the way you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. But be honest, you brought up Kline this morning because you\u2019re worried about seeing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d I gave her a patient look. \u201cYou\u2019re worried. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d sleep with him, but I do think you\u2019re anxious about crossing a line you shouldn\u2019t. You needed a strong reaction from me, so you were blunt and you got it. You needed to see what it would do to me. How just the thought of you with him makes me insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She gripped my biceps. \u201cNothing is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making excuses.\u201d I brushed my fingertips across her cheek. \u201cI hurt you and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. I wanted to avoid causing any problems and they happened anyway.\u201d</p><p>I knew she regretted our fight. I could see it in her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re learning as we go. We\u2019ll fuck up now and again. You just have to trust me, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, Gideon. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve gotten so far. But the fact that you\u2019d hurt me at all\u2014on purpose . . .\u201d She shook her head and I could see how what I\u2019d said was eating at her. \u201cYou were always supposed to be the one I could count on to never hurt me deliberately.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her doubt her trust in me was a hard blow. I took the hit, then explained myself the way I\u2019d only ever done with her. I would explain anything, talk for hours, write the promise in blood . . . if that was what it took to make her believe in me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between deliberation and malicious intent, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d I cupped her face in my hands. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll never cause you pain just to hurt you. Don\u2019t you see that I\u2019m just as vulnerable? You have the same power to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened, became even more stunning. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did. You\u2019ll have to forgive me.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cI hate when you use that tone of voice.\u201d</p><p>Inclined toward self-preservation, I didn\u2019t allow the smile I felt to show. \u201cBut it makes you wet.\u201d</p><p>Tossing a glare at me over her shoulder, Eva moved to the window and stood in the same spot I\u2019d occupied that morning. Her ponytail showed off her beauty\u2014and left her no way to conceal her emotions. Hot color rose in her cheeks.</p><p>Did she know how often I thought about tying her up when she was riled like this? Not to cage her or leash her, but to hold that vibrant energy of hers, that lust for life I\u2019d never learned to have. She gave that to me, surrendered it fully.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to control me with sex, Gideon,\u201d she said with her back to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to control you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou manipulate me. You do things . . . say things . . . just to get a particular response out of me.\u201d</p><p>My arms crossed as I remembered her kissing Kline. \u201cAs do you, which we just discussed.\u201d</p><p>She faced me. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to, I\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d I smiled then. \u201cI knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an enigma to me.\u201d She sighed and I could see her letting the lingering resentment go. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got me pegged. You know all my buttons and just how to push them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think I don\u2019t spend a good percentage of every day trying to figure you out, you\u2019re not paying attention. Think about that while I handle this meeting, and then we\u2019ll say good-bye properly.\u201d</p><p>As I sat in my chair, her gaze followed me. I adjusted the fit of my headset and paused when I realized she was staring. She liked looking at me. And hers was the only avid hunger that had ever made me feel good about myself. I\u2019d never had the knee-jerk defensive reaction to her sexual interest that others provoked. She made me feel loved and wanted in a way that wasn\u2019t the least threatening.</p><p>\u201cWatching you get into business mode makes me hot,\u201d she explained, her voice just husky enough to prevent me from fully focusing on work. \u201cSexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>My lips twisted wryly. \u201cAngel, behave for fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be the fun in that? Besides, you like me bad.\u201d</p><p>Damn straight.</p><p>\u201cFifteen minutes,\u201d I reiterated. Considering I\u2019d planned for the meeting to take close to an hour, that was a major concession.</p><p>\u201cDo what you have to do.\u201d Eva stopped by my chair and bent over like a pinup girl to breathe in my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll find something to occupy myself with while you\u2019re on the phone playing with your millions.\u201d</p><p>My cock was abruptly, painfully hard. She had said something similar to me when we\u2019d first started dating, and I had dreamed of it in the weeks since.</p><p>I would have told her to wait, but I knew she wouldn\u2019t. She had a determined look in her eye and a taunting swing to her hips as she circled my desk. I\u2019d fucked up and she wanted to get a piece of her own back. Some couples punished each other with pain or deprivation. Eva and I, we punished each other with pleasure.</p><p>The moment she stepped out of view, I logged into the meeting without activating my camera and I muted my microphone. All half-dozen participants were actively discussing the materials Scott had provided. I gave them a moment to register that I\u2019d logged in . . .</p><p>. . . and used the time to stand and open my fly.</p><p>Eva kicked off her heels. \u201cGood. It\u2019ll go easier on you if you cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually believe having your mouth wrapped around my dick while I\u2019m on a videoconference is going to be easy at any level.\u201d Even then, the team in California was chiming in with greetings through my headset. I ignored them for the moment, thinking only of what was about to happen right there in my office.</p><p>Only weeks ago the possibility that I\u2019d play while working would\u2019ve been nonexistent. If Eva had been wired any differently, I would\u2019ve made her wait until I had the time and attention to devote fully to her.</p><p>But my angel was a dangerous lover, one who got off on the thrill of being this close to discovery. I would never have known I enjoyed that edge if not for her. There were times I wanted to fuck her for the entire world to see, so it would be known definitively how completely I possessed her.</p><p>Her grin was pure wickedness. \u201cIf you liked things easy, you wouldn\u2019t have married me.\u201d</p><p>And I was going to marry her again, as soon as possible. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time. We\u2019d be renewing our vows often, reminding each other that we made a promise to be together forever, no matter what life threw at us.</p><p>Lowering gracefully to her knees on the far side of my desk, Eva set her hands on the floor and prowled toward me like a lioness on the hunt. Through the smoked-glass surface of my desktop, I watched her move into place, her tongue darting out to wet her lips.</p><p>Anticipation coursed through me, the rush of the challenge and erotic expectation. Everything about my wife gave me pleasure, but her mouth was in a class by itself. She sucked me off as if she were starved for my cum, as if the taste were something she was hooked on. Eva gave me head because she loved it. Watching me unravel while she did it was just a bonus.</p><p>I adjusted the spread of my fly and pushed down the waistband of my boxer briefs, studying her face as I revealed how she\u2019d affected me. Her lips parted as her breath quickened, her body shifting back until she was sitting on her heels like a supplicant.</p><p>Settling into my chair, I absorbed the unaccustomed feeling of restraint around my thighs and the pull of elastic beneath my balls. My reaction was swift and unpleasant, the sensation of being bound dredging up memories I kept ruthlessly buried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reconsidering, I started to roll back in my desk chair, my heart rate rising . . .</p><p>Eva swallowed me.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I hissed, my fingers digging into the armrests as her fingers dug into my hips.</p><p>The rush of wet heat over the sensitive crown of my cock was shockingly intense. Hard suction tightened around me and a satin-soft tongue massaged the perfect spot. Through the pounding of my heart, I heard the team questioning whether my webcam and headset were working properly . . .</p><p>Straightening my spine, I slid forward and activated my feeds. \u201cExcuse the delay,\u201d I said briskly as Eva took more of me. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve had the chance to review the deck, let\u2019s discuss the steps you\u2019ll be taking to implement the recommended adjustments.\u201d</p><p>Eva hummed her approval and the vibration reverberated through me. I was hard enough to drive nails and her slender fingers were teasing me, stroking with just enough pressure to make me want more.</p><p>Tim Henderson, the project manager and team leader, spoke first. I could barely focus, seeing him more from memory than the monitor in front of me. A tall, painfully thin man with pale skin and a wild mane of dark curls, he liked to talk, which was a blessing considering how dry my mouth had become.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like more time to review this,\u201d he began, \u201cbut off the cuff, I\u2019m thinking this is a seriously accelerated schedule. Some of this is great and I\u2019m excited about seeing what we can do with it, but phasing into consumer beta testing is at least a year away, not six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you told me six months ago,\u201d I reminded him, my fist clenching as Eva took my cock to the back of her throat. Sweat bloomed on the back of my neck when she pulled off, her mouth a hot velvet suction.</p><p>\u201cWe lost our top designer to LanCorp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I offered a replacement, which you declined.\u201d</p><p>Henderson\u2019s jaw tightened. He was a coding genius with a brilliant creative mind, but he didn\u2019t play well with others and was resistant to outside intervention. That would be his prerogative . . . if he weren\u2019t eating my time and money.</p><p>\u201cA creative team is a delicate balance,\u201d he argued. \u201cYou can\u2019t just plug a random person into the void. We\u2019ve got the right man on the job now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jeff Simmons interjected, his angular face breaking into a grin at the praise.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and we\u2019re making progress,\u201d Tim went on. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014keep blowing through your self-imposed deadlines.\u201d My tone was gruffer than I intended due to my wife\u2019s wickedly agile tongue. Soft, playful licks from root to tip were driving me half out of my mind. My thighs ached with strain, the muscles hardened by the force it took to keep me in my chair. She was following the line of every sensitive vein, stroking over the throbbing ridges with the flat of her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhile creating an exceptional and groundbreaking user experience,\u201d he shot back. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the job done and we\u2019re doing it right.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to bend Eva over my desk and fuck her. Hard.</p><p>To do that, I needed to get through the damn meeting.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Now, you just need to do it faster. I\u2019m sending out a team to help you achieve the objectives on time. They\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, wait a minute, Cross,\u201d Henderson snapped, leaning closer to the webcam. \u201cYou send some corporate bean counters over to breathe down our necks and you\u2019re only going to slow us down! You need to leave the development to us. If we need your help, we\u2019ll ask for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you thought I\u2019d give you my money and be a silent partner, you didn\u2019t do your homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Eva murmured, her eyes bright with laughter beneath the glass.</p> <p>I reached beneath the desk and cupped her nape, squeezing. \u201cThe app space is highly competitive. That\u2019s why you approached me. You presented me with a unique and intriguing gaming concept, and a one-year development-to-rollout timeline, which was judged by my team to be reasonable and achievable.\u201d</p><p>I paused on a breath, tormented by the feel of warm lips gliding up and down my raging dick. Eva was working with purpose now, driving me on with hard pumps of her fist. There was no more buildup, no teasing. She wanted me to come. Now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking at this from the wrong perspective, Mr. Cross,\u201d Ken Harada said, running his hand over a blue goatee. \u201cTechnical timelines don\u2019t make allowances for an organic creative process. You don\u2019t understand how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me the villain here.\u201d The urge to thrust, to fuck, was clawing. Aggression built in me like a tidal wave, forcing me to fight for any semblance of civility. \u201cYou guaranteed on-time delivery of all elements on a schedule you created and you\u2019re not holding up your end. I\u2019m now forced to help you keep the promises you made.\u201d</p><p>The artist slumped back in his seat, muttering under his breath.</p><p>Tightening my grip on Eva\u2019s neck, I tried to slow her down. Then I gave up and started moving her, urging her roughly to suck faster. Harder. To drain me. \u201cThis is how this is going to play out. You\u2019ll work with the team I\u2019m sending. If you miss another deadline, I\u2019m pulling Tim off oversight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThis is my fucking app! You can\u2019t take it from me.\u201d</p><p>I needed finesse but had none, my brain hazed with the animal need to mate. \u201cYou should\u2019ve read the contract more carefully. Do that tonight and we\u2019ll revisit tomorrow after the team arrives.\u201d</p><p>After I come . . .</p><p>Tingles raced along my spine. My balls drew up. I was a minute away, and Eva knew it. Her cheeks were hollowing with the force of her suction, her tongue fluttering over the sensitive underside of my cockhead. My heart was pounding, my palms damp with perspiration.</p><p>Staring into a half-dozen angry faces with a riot of protests exploding from my earpiece, I felt the orgasm hit me like a freight train. I fumbled for the mute button and let the groan tear from my throat as I spurted powerfully into Eva\u2019s greedily working mouth. She moaned and milked my dick with both hands, pulling and squeezing as I kept coming in a flood I couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>I felt the heat race up into my face. Staring stonily into my monitor, I fought the urge to close my eyes and throw my head back, to free myself to absorb the singular pleasure of coming for my wife. Coming because of her.</p><p>As the pressure eased, I released her hair and touched her cheek with my fingertips.</p><p>I unmuted my microphone.</p><p>\u201cMy admin will call you in a few minutes,\u201d I cut in, my voice hoarse, \u201cto arrange tomorrow\u2019s meeting. I hope we can come to an amicable agreement. Until then.\u201d</p><p>I shut down my browser and yanked off my headset. \u201cCome here, angel.\u201d</p><p>My chair was shoved back and I\u2019d hauled her out before she had the chance to come out on her own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a machine!\u201d she gasped, her voice as rough as mine, her lips red and swollen. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t even twitch! How can you\u2014 Oh!\u201d</p><p>The tiny scrap of lace she wore as underwear dropped to the floor in pieces.</p><p>\u201cI liked those panties,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>Lifting her, I set her bare ass on the cool glass, aligning her perfectly to take my cock. \u201cYou\u2019ll like this more.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cANGEL.\u201d</p><p>Like a sleepy kitten, Eva blinked at me as I stepped out of my office washroom. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>I grinned at finding her still slumped in my desk chair. \u201cI assume you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d She reached up and ran a hand over her hair. \u201cMissing the brain you just fucked out of me, but otherwise, I\u2019m feeling excellent, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I headed toward her with a warm damp washcloth.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to set a new record for most orgasms in a single day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn intriguing proposition. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot.\u201d</p><p>She held out her hand as if to ward me off. \u201cNo more, maniac. You screw me again and I\u2019ll be a drooling, babbling idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you change your mind.\u201d I kneeled in front of her and urged her legs open. Waxed smooth and pretty pink, her cunt was lovely. Perfect.</p><p>She watched me as I cleaned her, her fingers reaching out to comb through my hair. \u201cDon\u2019t work too hard this weekend, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if there\u2019s something else worth doing without you around,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cSleep in. Read a book. Plan a party.\u201d</p><p>My mouth quirked. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten. I\u2019m asking the guys tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The laziness left her eyes. I pulled back before her legs closed. \u201cWhat guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones you want to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling them?</p><p>I stood. \u201cWe\u2019re getting together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink. Hang out.\u201d Returning to the bathroom, I tossed the washcloth in the hamper and washed my hands.</p><p>Eva followed me. \u201cAt a club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Probably not.\u201d</p><p>She lounged against the doorjamb and crossed her arms. \u201cAre any of them married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I slung the hand towel back on the rack. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Is Arnoldo going to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the short answers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the interrogation?\u201d I asked the question, but I knew. My wife was a jealous, possessive woman. Lucky for both of us, I liked it. A lot.</p><p>She shrugged, but it was a defensive gesture. \u201cI just want to know what you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay home if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to do that.\u201d</p><p>There was a smudge of dark makeup beneath her eyes. I loved mussing her up and giving her that just-fucked look. No woman wore it better. \u201cGet to the point, then.\u201d</p><p>She made a frustrated noise. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me what you guys have planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Eva. Usually we meet at one of our places and drink. Play cards. Sometimes we go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrolling. A group of hot guys who\u2019ve got a buzz and want a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a crime. And who said they\u2019re attractive?\u201d</p><p>She shot me a look. \u201cThey\u2019re trolling with you. That means they\u2019re either hot enough not to completely pale in your shadow or too confident to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>I held up my left hand. The bloodred rubies in my wedding band caught the light. I never took the ring off and never would. \u201cRemember this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about you,\u201d she muttered, her arms dropping to her sides. \u201cIf I\u2019m not fucking you enough, you need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the wife who couldn\u2019t wait fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>She stuck her tongue out at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what got you fucked right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArnoldo doesn\u2019t trust me, Gideon. He doesn\u2019t really want you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his decision to make. And some of your friends aren\u2019t going to like me, either. I know Cary\u2019s on the fence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Arnoldo tells the others how he feels about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d I went to her and caught her by the hips. \u201cTalking about feelings is predominantly female territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sexist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m right. Besides, Arnoldo knows how it is. He\u2019s been in love before.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at me with those uniquely beautiful eyes. \u201cAre you in love, Mr. Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrevocably.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>MANUEL Alcoa slapped me on the back as he rounded me. \u201cYou just cost me a thousand dollars, Cross.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against the kitchen island and shoved my hand into the pocket of my jeans, wrapping it around my smartphone. Eva was midflight and I was alert for any word from her or Ra\u00fal. I\u2019d never feared flying, never worried over someone\u2019s safety while traveling. Until now.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked, before taking a swig of my beer.</p><p>\u201cYou are the last man I figured would tie the knot and you turn out to be the first.\u201d Manuel shook his head. \u201cKills me.\u201d</p><p>I lowered the bottle. \u201cYou bet against me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Although I suspect someone had the inside scoop.\u201d The portfolio manager narrowed his eyes across the island at Arnoldo Ricci, who lifted one shoulder in a shrug.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d have bet against me, too.\u201d</p><p>Manuel grinned. \u201cLatinas rule, my friend. Sexy, curvy. More than a handful in bed and out. Hot tempered. Passionate.\u201d He hummed. \u201cGood choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManuel!\u201d Arash yelled from the living room. \u201cBring those limes over here.\u201d</p><p>I watched Manuel leave the kitchen with the bowl of lime slices. Arash\u2019s condo was modern and spacious with a panoramic view of the East River. There was a notable lack of walls except for those hiding the bathrooms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Circling the granite-topped island, I approached Arnoldo. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His gaze dropped to the amber liquid he swirled in a tumbler. \u201cI\u2019d ask you the same, but you look well. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t waste time with small talk. \u201cEva worries that you\u2019ve got a problem with her.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019ve never been disrespectful to your woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe never said you were.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo drank, taking a moment to savor the fine liquor before swallowing it. \u201cI understand that you are\u2014what\u2019s the word?\u2014held captive by this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptivated,\u201d I provided, wondering why he didn\u2019t just speak in Italian.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d He gave me a slight smile. \u201cI have been there, my friend, as you know. I don\u2019t judge you.\u201d</p><p>I knew Arnoldo understood. I\u2019d found him in Florence, recovering from the loss of a woman by drowning in liquor and cooking like a madman, producing so much five-star cuisine he was giving it away. I had been fascinated by the totality of his despair and unable to relate.</p> <p>I\u2019d been so certain I would never know anything like it. Like the opacity and soundproofing of the glass wall in my office, my view of life had been dulled. I knew I\u2019d never be able to explain to Eva how she\u2019d appeared to me the first time I saw her, so vibrant and warm. A colorful explosion in a black-and-white landscape.</p><p>\u201cVoglio che sia felice.\u201d It was a simple statement, but the crux of the issue. I want her to be happy.</p><p>\u201cIf her happiness depends on what I think,\u201d he answered in Italian, \u201cyou ask too much. I will never say anything against her. I\u2019ll always treat her with the respect I feel for you as long as you are together. But what I believe is my choice and my right, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I looked over at Arash, who was lining up shot glasses on the bar in the living room. As my lead attorney, he knew about both my marriage and Eva\u2019s sex tape, and he didn\u2019t have a problem with either one.</p><p>\u201cOur relationship is . . . complex,\u201d I explained quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve hurt her as much as she\u2019s ever hurt me\u2014likely more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised to hear that, but I am sorry.\u201d Arnoldo studied me. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t choose one of the other women who\u2019ve loved you and would give you no trouble? A comfortable ornament who would settle into your life without a ripple?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs Eva says, what would be the fun in that?\u201d My smile faded. \u201cShe challenges me, Arnoldo. Makes me see things . . . think about things, in ways I didn\u2019t before. And she loves me. Not like the others.\u201d I reached for my phone again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t allow the others to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I was waiting for her.\u201d A thoughtful expression crossed his face and I said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine your Bianca was hassle-free.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo. But my life is simple. I can use complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life was ordered. Now, it\u2019s an adventure.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo sobered, his dark eyes growing serious. \u201cBut that wildness in her that you love is what worries me most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will mention this only once, then never again. You may be angry with me for what I say, but understand that my heart is in the right place.\u201d</p> <p>My jaw tightened. \u201cGet it off your chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sat with Eva and Brett Kline at dinner. I observed them together. There is chemistry there, not unlike what I saw between Bianca and the man she left me for. I wish I believed Eva would ignore it, but she\u2019s already proven that she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I held his gaze. \u201cShe had her reasons. Reasons I gave her.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo took another drink. \u201cThen I\u2019ll pray that you don\u2019t give her more reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Arash shouted. \u201cCut it out with the Italian and get your asses in here.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo touched his glass to my bottle before passing me.</p><p>I finished my beer alone, taking a moment to consider what Arnoldo had said.</p><p>Then I joined the party.</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S GOT YOU frowning, baby girl?\u201d Cary asked, his voice low and sleepy from the Dramamine he\u2019d downed at takeoff.</p><p>Staring at the choices in the dropdown menu my cursor hovered over, I debated which to pick. Engaged or It\u2019s complicated? Since Married also applied, I thought All of the above should\u2019ve been an option.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be fun to explain?</p><p>Glancing across the luxurious cabin of Gideon\u2019s private jet, I found my best friend sprawled along the white leather sofa with his hands tucked behind his head. Long and lean, he was a pretty picture with his shirt riding high and his cargo pants riding low, exposing the amazing abs that were helping Grey Isles to sell jeans, underwear, and other men\u2019s clothing.</p><p>Cary had no problem whatsoever accustoming himself to the luxurious conveniences of Gideon\u2019s immense wealth. He\u2019d settled immediately and comfortably into the elegant appointments of the ultra-modern cabin. And somehow, even casually dressed, he looked perfectly at home amid the brushed steel and gray oak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to set up some social media accounts,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d He sat up with effortless grace, his posture surprisingly and instantly alert. \u201cBig step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Nathan had kept me hiding, afraid to put myself out there and risk making it easy for him to find me. \u201cBut it\u2019s time. I feel like . . . Never mind. It\u2019s just time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He set his elbows on his knees and tapped his fingertips together. \u201cThen why is your face all scrunched up like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a lot to consider. I mean, how much do I share out there? I don\u2019t have to worry about Nathan anymore, but Gideon is under constant scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>With my thoughts on Gideon, I ran a search for his profile. It popped up with the little blue check mark that told me it was verified as belonging to him. The sight of his picture, a shot of him in a black three-piece suit and the blue tie I loved, sent a pang of longing through me. He\u2019d been photographed on a rooftop with the skyline of Manhattan fuzzily out of focus behind him, while he was sharply and vividly captured by the camera\u2019s lens.</p><p>He was even sharper and more vibrant in reality. I stared into Gideon\u2019s eyes, getting lost in that impossible blue. His black hair framed that perfect fallen-angel face in strands of glossy, inky silk.</p><p>Poetic? Yes. But then his looks could inspire sonnets. To say nothing of spur-of-the-moment marriage.</p><p>When had the photo been taken? Before we\u2019d met? He had the implacable, remote look that made him seem like such an impossible dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married,\u201d I blurted out, tearing my gaze away from the most gorgeous man I\u2019d ever seen. \u201cTo Gideon, of course. Who else would I be married to?\u201d</p><p>Cary froze while I rambled. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my palms on my yoga pants. It was a cop-out telling him the news while motion sickness drugs lulled his brain, but I\u2019d take any advantage I could get. \u201cWhen we went away last weekend. We eloped.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long, weighted minute. Then he exploded to his feet. \u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d</p><p>Ra\u00fal\u2019s head turned in our direction. The movement was casual and unhurried, but his gaze was vigilant and watchful. He sat in the far corner, being eerily unobtrusive for such a hard-to-miss guy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the damned rush?\u201d Cary snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt just . . . happened.\u201d I couldn\u2019t explain it. I\u2019d thought it was too soon. Still did. But Gideon was the only man I would ever love so completely. When I considered that, I knew Gideon had been right; we\u2019d only be postponing the inevitable. And Gideon needed my promise that I was his forever. My amazing husband who found it so hard to believe he could be loved. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Cary shoved both hands into his hair. \u201cJesus, Eva. You don\u2019t up and marry the first guy you have a serious relationship with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d I protested, awkwardly avoiding looking at Ra\u00fal. \u201cYou know how we feel about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You two are whack jobs separately. Together, you\u2019re a goddamn nut house.\u201d</p><p>I flipped him the bird. \u201cWe\u2019ll work on it. Wearing a ring doesn\u2019t mean we stop figuring things out.\u201d</p><p>He dropped into the chair across from me. \u201cWhat incentive has he got to fix anything? He\u2019s bagged and tagged the prize. You\u2019re stuck with his psychotic dreams and Grand Canyon\u2013sized mood swings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d I said tightly, feeling the sting of truth in his words. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get upset when I told you we were engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I figured it\u2019d be a year, at the very least, before Monica got the wedding worked out. Maybe a year and a half. At least some time for you two to try living together.\u201d</p><p>I let him rant. Better that he did it at thirty thousand feet than in some public venue where the whole world could hear.</p><p>He leaned closer, his green eyes fierce. \u201cI\u2019m having a baby and I\u2019m not getting married. You know why? Because I\u2019m too fucked up and I know it. I\u2019ve got no business hitching a passenger on this wild ride. If he loved you, he\u2019d be thinking about you and what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re happy for me, Cary. That means a lot.\u201d</p><p>The words dripped with sarcasm, but they were honest in their own way. There were girlfriends I could call who would tell me what an amazingly lucky bitch I was. Cary was my closest friend because he always gave it to me straight, even when I desperately wanted sugarcoating.</p><p>But Cary was thinking only about the darkness. He didn\u2019t understand the light Gideon brought into my life. The acceptance and the love. The safety. Gideon had given me my freedom back, a life without terror. Giving him vows in return was too simple a repayment for that.</p><p>I turned my attention back to Gideon\u2019s profile, scrolling down to see that the most recent post was a link to an article about our engagement. I doubted he\u2019d posted it himself; he was too busy to bother with something like that. But I figured he\u2019d approved it. If not, he had somehow already made it clear that I was important enough to become the one bit of personal news that was okay to be shared on an otherwise business-focused profile.</p><p>Gideon was proud of me. Proud to be marrying me, a hot mess with a history of bad choices. Whatever anyone else thought, I knew I was the one who\u2019d bagged and tagged the prize.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Cary slouched into the chair. \u201cMake me feel like an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the shoe fits . . .\u201d I muttered, clicking on the link to view other photos of Gideon.</p><p>It was a mistake.</p><p>All the pictures posted by his social media admin were business-related, but the unofficial pictures he\u2019d been tagged in weren\u2019t. There, in living color, were images of him with beautiful women. And they hit me hard. Jealousy clawed and twisted my stomach.</p><p>God, he looked amazing in a tuxedo. Dark and dangerous. His face savagely beautiful, his cheekbones and mouth chiseled perfection, his posture confident and more than a little arrogant. An alpha male in his prime.</p><p>I knew the photos weren\u2019t recent. I knew the women in them didn\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of his insanely mad skills in bed; he had a rule about that. Neither of which stopped the images from making me twitchy.</p><p>\u201cAm I the last to know?\u201d Cary asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one.\u201d I glanced at Ra\u00fal. \u201cAt least on my side. Gideon wants to tell the world, but we\u2019re going to keep it under wraps.\u201d</p><p>He studied me. \u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever. The next wedding we have will be our first as far as anyone else is concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou having second thoughts?\u201d</p><p>It killed me that Cary didn\u2019t care that we had an audience. I was hyperaware that every move I made, every word I said was being witnessed.</p><p>Not that Ra\u00fal\u2019s presence had any effect on my answer. \u201cNo. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re married. I love him, Cary.\u201d</p><p>I was glad Gideon was mine. And I missed him. Worse after seeing those pictures.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d Cary said with a sigh.</p><p>Unable to help myself, I opened the messaging app on my laptop and sent Gideon a text. I miss you.</p><p>He texted back almost instantly. Turn the plane around.</p><p>That made me smile. It was so like him. And so unlike me. Wasting the pilots\u2019 time, the fuel . . . it seemed so frivolous to me. More than that, though, would be the proof of how dependent on Gideon I\u2019d become. That would be the kiss of death in our relationship. He could have anything, any woman, at any time. If I ever became too easy for him, we\u2019d both lose respect for me. Losing his love wouldn\u2019t be far behind.</p><p>I returned to my new profile and uploaded a selfie I\u2019d taken with Gideon that I synced from my smartphone. I made it the masthead image. Then I tagged him and gave it a description: The love of my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sylvia Day</p><p>Crossfire Series Book</p><p>Crossfire #1: Bared to You</p><p>Crossfire #2: Reflected in You</p> <p>Crossfire #3: Entwined with You</p><p>Crossfire #4: Captivated by You</p><p>After all, if his photos were going to include him with women, I wanted at least one of them to be me. And the one I\u2019d chosen was undeniably intimate. We lay on our backs, our temples touching, my face bare of makeup and his relaxed with a smile in his eyes. I dared anyone to look at it and not see that I had a private bond with him the world would never know.</p><p>I suddenly wanted to call him. So badly that I could almost hear that amazingly sexy voice, as intoxicating as top-shelf liquor, smooth with just a hint of bite. I wanted to be with him, my hand in his, my lips against his throat where the smell of his skin called to something hungry and primitive inside me.</p><p>It scared me sometimes, how much I needed him. To the exclusion of everything else. There was no one I wanted to be with more, including my best friend, who was at that moment needing me almost as fiercely.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good, Cary,\u201d I assured him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be more worried if I thought you actually believed that.\u201d He shoved the bangs off his forehead with an impatient hand. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBut it\u2019ll work out.\u201d</p><p>It had to. I couldn\u2019t imagine my life without Gideon in it.</p><p>Cary\u2019s head dropped back and his eyes closed. I might have thought he was succumbing to the motion sickness pills, except his knuckles were white from gripping the armrests too tightly. He was taking the news hard. I didn\u2019t know what I could say to reassure him.</p><p>You\u2019re still heading in the wrong direction, Gideon texted.</p> <p>I almost asked him how he knew that, but caught myself. Are you having a good time with the guys?</p><p>I\u2019d have more fun with you.</p><p>I grinned. I would hope so. My fingers paused, then: I told Cary.</p><p>The answer wasn\u2019t instantaneous. Still friends?</p><p>He hasn\u2019t disowned me yet.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything to that, and I told myself not to read too much into his silence. He was out with his guys. It had been asking a lot to even hear from him at all.</p><p>Still, I was super happy to get a text from him ten minutes later.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop missing me.</p> <p>I looked over at Cary and found him watching me. Was Gideon facing similar disapproval from his friends?</p><p>Don\u2019t stop loving me, I texted back.</p><p>His answer was simple and very much Gideon. Deal.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cSOCAL, baby, I missed you.\u201d Cary descended the steps from the plane to the tarmac, tilting his head back to look up at the night sky. \u201cGod, it\u2019s good to leave that East Coast humidity behind.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled down after him, eager to get to the tall, dark figure waiting by a shiny black Suburban. Victor Reyes was the kind of male who commanded attention. Part of that was due to his being a cop. The rest was all him.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d I ran full bore toward him and he unfolded from where he\u2019d been leaning against the SUV and opened his arms to me.</p><p>He absorbed the crash of my body into his and lifted me off my feet, squeezing me so tightly I couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, baby,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Cary sauntered up to us. My dad put me down.</p><p>\u201cCary.\u201d My dad clasped Cary\u2019s hand, then pulled him in for a quick hug and a hearty slap on the back. \u201cLooking good, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot everything?\u201d my dad asked. He eyed Ra\u00fal, who\u2019d exited the plane first and now stood silently near a black Benz that had been parked and waiting close by.</p><p>Gideon had told me to forget that Ra\u00fal was there. That wasn\u2019t easy for me to do.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Cary answered, adjusting the weight of his duffel strap on his shoulder. He carried my bag, which was lighter than his, in his hand. Even with all my makeup and three pairs of shoes, Cary had packed more than me.</p><p>I loved that about him.</p><p>\u201cYou two hungry?\u201d My dad opened the passenger door for me.</p><p>It was just past nine in California, but after midnight in New York. Too late for me to eat usually, but we hadn\u2019t grabbed dinner.</p><p>Cary answered before climbing into the backseat. \u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re always hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you, sweet cheeks,\u201d he shot back, sliding into the center seat so he could lean forward and be in the mix. \u201cI\u2019ve just got no guilt about it.\u201d</p><p>We pulled away from the jet and I watched it grow smaller as we cruised down the tarmac toward the exit. I glanced at my dad\u2019s profile, looking for any hint of his thoughts about the lifestyle I\u2019d be living as Gideon\u2019s wife. The private jets. The full-time bodyguards. I knew how he felt about Stanton\u2019s wealth, but that was my stepdad. I was hoping a husband would be cut some slack.</p><p>Still, I knew the change in routine was glaring. Previously, we would\u2019ve flown into San Diego\u2019s harbor. We would have headed to the Gaslamp and grabbed a table at Dick\u2019s Last Resort, spending an hour or more laughing at the silliness and enjoying a beer with dinner.</p><p>There was tension now that hadn\u2019t been there before. Nathan. Gideon. My mom. They were all hovering between us.</p><p>It sucked. Massively.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that place in Oceanside with the slushy beer and peanut shells on the floor?\u201d Cary suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I twisted in my seat to give him a grateful smile. \u201cThat\u2019d be fun.\u201d</p><p>Laid-back and familiar. Perfect.</p><p>I could tell my dad thought so, too, when I looked at him and his mouth quirked. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>We left the airport behind. I dug out my phone and turned it on, wanting to sync it to the Suburban\u2019s sound system so we could listen to music that would take us back to less complicated times.</p><p>Texts popped up so fast, they filled my screen then scrolled off.</p><p>The most recent one was from Brett. Call me when you get into town.</p><p>And right on cue, \u201cGolden\u201d started playing on the radio.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I was climbing the steps of my dad\u2019s tiny porch the next day when my phone started vibrating. I pulled it out of my shorts pocket and felt a tingle of happiness at the sight of Gideon\u2019s picture on the screen.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I answered, settling into one of the two cushioned wrought-iron chairs near the front door. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d The beloved soft rasp of his voice slid sweetly through me. \u201cRa\u00fal says Victor\u2019s coffee could wake a hibernating bear.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the Benz parked across the narrow street. The tinted windows were so dark I couldn\u2019t see the man inside. It was a bit freaky that Ra\u00fal had somehow managed to talk to Gideon about the coffee I\u2019d just barely taken over to him before I even made it back to the house. \u201cAre you trying to intimidate me with how closely you\u2019re watching me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf intimidation were my goal, I wouldn\u2019t be subtle about it.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the mug I\u2019d dropped off on the small patio table prior to making my java delivery to Ra\u00fal. \u201cYou do know that tone of voice makes me want to irritate you back, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you like the way I rise to the challenge,\u201d he purred, sending little goose bumps across my skin despite the warmth of the summer day.</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cSo, what exactly did you guys end up doing last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual. Drink. Give each other a hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>My grip tightened on the phone as I pictured a pack of hot guys out on the prowl. \u201cI hope you had fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad. Tell me your plans for the day.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the same note of tightness in his words that I\u2019d just had. Unfortunately, marriage wasn\u2019t a cure for jealousy. \u201cWhen Cary wakes up and rolls his ass off the couch, we\u2019ll grab a quick lunch with my dad. Then we\u2019re going down to San Diego to see Dr. Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tonight?\u201d</p><p>I took a sip of my coffee, steeling myself for an argument. I knew he was thinking about Brett. \u201cThe band\u2019s manager sent me an e-mail about where to claim VIP tickets, but I\u2019ve decided not to see the show. I figure Cary can take a friend, if he wants. What I have to say won\u2019t take very long, so either I\u2019ll see Brett tomorrow before I leave or we can chat on the phone.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled softly. \u201cI expect you have an idea of what you\u2019re going to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna keep it simple. With \u2018Golden\u2019 and my engagement, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for us to see each other socially. I hope we\u2019ll be friends and keep in touch, but e-mail and texts are better, unless you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>He was silent long enough that I thought maybe the call had dropped. \u201cGideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know if you\u2019re afraid to see him.\u201d</p><p>Uneasy, I took another drink. The coffee had cooled, but I barely tasted it anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight about Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your solution is to avoid him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I have enough shit to fight about without throwing him into the mix. He\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was quiet again. This time, I waited him out.</p><p>When his voice came again, it was confident and decisive. \u201cI can live with that, Eva.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders relaxed and something inside me eased. And then, paradoxically, my chest tightened. I remembered what he\u2019d said to me once, that he\u2019d live with me loving another man just so long as he had me.</p><p>He loved me so much more than he loved himself. It broke my heart that he\u2019d sell himself short like that. It made it impossible to hold myself back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re everything to me,\u201d I breathed. \u201cI think about you all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no different for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I lowered my voice further, trying to keep it down. \u201cBecause I have it so bad for you. I get\u2014well, hot. Like I\u2019m overcome with this desperate need to be touching you. My brain scatters and I have to take a minute to ride it out, but it\u2019s so hard to deal. So many times I\u2019ve almost dropped whatever I\u2019m doing to get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fantasies about barging into one of your meetings and just running right into you. Have I told you that? When the craving is really bad, I can almost feel you pulling at me.\u201d</p><p>I rushed on when I heard him growl softly. \u201cI lose my breath every time I see you. If I close my eyes, I can hear your voice. I woke up this morning and I panicked a little because you\u2019re so far away. I would\u2019ve given anything to be able to get to you. I wanted to cry because I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. Eva, please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to worry about anything, Gideon, it should be me. Because I can\u2019t be rational when it comes to you. I\u2019m crazy about you. Literally. I can\u2019t think about a future without you\u2014it freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it. You\u2019ll never be without me. We\u2019re going to grow old together. Die together. I\u2019m not going to live a single day without you.\u201d</p><p>A tear slid from the corner of my eye. I scrubbed it away. \u201cI need you to understand that you\u2019ll never have to settle for pieces of me. You shouldn\u2019t be settling at all. You deserve so much better. You could have anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d</p><p>I jumped at the lash of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou will not ever say anything like that to me again,\u201d he snapped. \u201cOr I swear to God, angel, I will punish you.\u201d</p><p>Shocked silence filled the space between us. The words I\u2019d spoken circled restlessly in my mind, taunting me with how pathetic I could be. I never wanted to be dependent on him, but I already was.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up. For God\u2019s sake, Eva, we\u2019re married. We\u2019re in love. There\u2019s no shame in that. So what if it\u2019s crazy? It\u2019s us. It\u2019s who we are. You need to come to grips with that.\u201d</p><p>The screen door squeaked as my dad stepped onto the porch. I looked at him and said, \u201cMy dad\u2019s here, Gideon. I\u2019ll have to talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me happy,\u201d he said, in the deep firm tone he used when making an unswayable decision. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten what that feels like. Don\u2019t devalue what you mean to me.\u201d</p><p>God.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d I ended the call and set the phone down on the table with a shaky hand.</p><p>My dad settled into the other chair with his coffee. He wore long shorts and a dark olive T-shirt, but his feet were bare. He\u2019d shaved and his hair was still damp, the ends curling slightly as they dried.</p><p>He was my father, but that didn\u2019t stop me from appreciating the fact that he was ridiculously attractive. He kept himself in great shape and had a naturally confident bearing. I could see why my mother hadn\u2019t been able to resist him when they\u2019d met. And apparently still couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI heard you talking,\u201d he said without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My stomach dropped. It was bad enough spilling my guts to Gideon. Knowing that my dad had heard me do it only made it worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was going to talk to you about whether you knew what you were doing, getting engaged so soon and so young.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my legs up and crossed them under me. \u201cI figured you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now I think I understand what you\u2019re feeling.\u201d He looked at me, his gray eyes soft and searching. \u201cYou express it far better than I ever could, back in the day. The most I could ever get out was \u2018I love you,\u2019 and it\u2019s just not enough.\u201d</p><p>I could see he was thinking about my mom. I knew it must be hard not to when I looked so much like her. \u201cGideon doesn\u2019t think those words are enough, either.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at my rings. The one Gideon had given me to express his need to hold on to me, and the other both a symbol of his commitment and a tribute to a time in his past when he\u2019d last felt loved. \u201cHe shows me, though. All the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to him a few times now.\u201d My dad paused. \u201cI have to remind myself that he\u2019s in his twenties.\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. \u201cHe\u2019s very self-possessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also very hard to read.\u201d</p><p>My smile widened. \u201cHe\u2019s a poker player. But he means what he says.\u201d</p> <p>I believed Gideon implicitly. He always told me the truth. The problem was, there was a lot he didn\u2019t tell me.</p><p>\u201cAnd he wants to marry my daughter.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look. \u201cYou gave him your blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he would always take care of you. He promised to keep you safe and make you happy.\u201d He stared across the street at the Benz. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why I believe him, even with him staking out my place for you. Doesn\u2019t help that he lied about waiting to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait, Dad. Don\u2019t hold it against him. He loves me too much.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sound happy when you were just talking to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I sounded desperate and insecure.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI love him like mad, but I hate when I get needy with it. We should be balanced in our relationship. Equals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood goal. Don\u2019t lose sight of it. Does he want that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants us to be together. In everything. But he\u2019s built a reputation and an empire, and I want to build my own. Not necessarily the empire, but the reputation for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to him about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d My mouth quirked. \u201cBut he believes Mrs. Cross should naturally play on Team Cross. And I can see his point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear that you\u2019ve been thinking this through.\u201d</p><p>I heard the pause. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that could be a serious issue, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>I loved the way my dad urged me to explore without trying to sway me or judge. He\u2019d always been that way. \u201cYes. I don\u2019t think it would become a deal breaker for us, but it could cause problems. He isn\u2019t used to not getting what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks so.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cGideon isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s me. He\u2019s been through a lot in his life and he\u2019s had to deal with it on his own. I don\u2019t want him to feel like he\u2019s got to handle everything himself anymore. I want him to feel like we\u2019re a unit and that I\u2019m here to support him. That\u2019s a hard message to send when I want my own independence, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like me,\u201d he said with a soft smile, looking so handsome that my heart swelled with pride.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll get along with him. He\u2019s a good man, with a beautiful heart. He\u2019d do anything for me, Dad.\u201d Even kill for me.</p><p>The thought made me queasy. The possibility that Gideon would have to answer for Nathan\u2019s death in some way was all too real. I couldn\u2019t let anything happen to him.</p><p>\u201cWould he let me pay for the wedding?\u201d My dad snorted out a laugh. \u201cI guess I should ask how much of a fight you think your mother would give me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad . . .\u201d My chest tightened again. After the discussions we\u2019d had about paying for my college tuition, I knew better than to say he didn\u2019t have to stretch his finances to the breaking point for me. It was a point of pride and my father was a very proud man. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say except thank you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a relieved smile and I realized that he\u2019d been expecting me to be resistant, too. \u201cI\u2019ve got about fifty large. I know it\u2019s not much\u2014\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>I could already hear my mom\u2019s freakout in my head. I\u2019d cope with that when the time came.</p><p>It would be worth it for the look on my father\u2019s face at that moment.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cIT hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d Cary paused on the sidewalk outside the former recreation center and pulled the sunglasses off his face. His gaze slid over the gym\u2019s entrance. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this place.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hand and linked our fingers. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>We headed up the walk and nodded at the couple standing by the door smoking. Then we went inside and were greeted by the sights and sounds of a hoops match in progress. Two teams of three played a half-court game, taunting each other and laughing. I knew from experience that sometimes Dr. Travis\u2019s unusual offices were the only place one felt free and safe enough to laugh.</p><p>We waved at the players, who paused just long enough to register us, and then we made a beeline for the door that still had Coach emblazoned on the glass inset. It was ajar and a beloved figure lounged in a worn desk chair with his feet propped on the desk. He tossed a tennis ball against the wall and caught it deftly, over and over, while a fellow patient I knew from before vaped on an electronic cigarette and talked.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Kyle stood in a rush, her pretty red mouth falling open and a cloud of vapor billowing out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you two were back!\u201d</p><p>She launched herself at Cary, barely giving me time to let his hand go.</p><p>Dr. Travis folded his legs and then stood, his kind face splitting with a welcoming grin. He was dressed in his usual khakis and dress shirt, with the leather sandals on his feet and the earrings in his ears giving him away as a tad unconventional. His sandy brown hair was shaggy and messy, and his wire-rimmed glasses were slightly skewed on the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you two until sometime after three,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after three in New York,\u201d Cary rejoined, disentangling himself from Kyle.</p><p>I had my suspicions that Cary had slept with the pretty blonde at some point, and that she hadn\u2019t brushed it off as easily as he had.</p><p>Dr. Travis caught me up in a quick hug, then did the same to Cary. I watched my best friend\u2019s eyes close and his cheek rest for a moment on Dr. Travis\u2019s shoulder. My eyes stung as they always did whenever I saw Cary happy. Dr. Travis was the closest thing to a father that he had and I knew how much Cary loved him.</p><p>\u201cYou two still watching each other\u2019s backs in the Big Apple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied.</p><p>Cary jerked his thumb at me. \u201cShe\u2019s getting married. I\u2019m having a baby.\u201d</p><p>Kyle gasped.</p><p>I elbowed Cary in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cOww,\u201d he complained, rubbing his side.</p><p>Dr. Travis blinked. \u201cCongratulations. Quick work, both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Kyle muttered. \u201cWhat\u2019s it been? A month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyle.\u201d Dr. Travis tucked his chair into his desk. \u201cWould you give us a minute?\u201d</p><p>She snorted and sauntered toward the door. \u201cYou\u2019re good, Doc, but I think you\u2019re going to need more time than that.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cENGAGED, huh?\u201d Kyle took another drag off her e-cigarette, her eyes on Cary as he leaped above Dr. Travis\u2019s head and made a slam dunk. We sat on the worn bleachers about three rows from the top, enough distance away that we couldn\u2019t overhear the therapy session taking place on the court.</p><p>Cary got restless when he opened up. Dr. Travis had quickly learned to keep Cary physically active if he wanted to keep him talking.</p><p>Kyle looked at me. \u201cI always kinda figured you and Cary would end up together.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that with us. Never has been.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. Her eyes were the color of the San Diego sky and heavily rimmed with electric blue liner. \u201cYou known this guy you\u2019re marrying long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Travis nailed a bank shot and then ruffled Cary\u2019s hair affectionately. I saw him glance at me and knew it was my turn.</p><p>I stood and stretched. \u201cCatch you later,\u201d I said to Kyle.</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>My mouth twisted wryly and I made my way down the stairs until I reached Dr. Travis.</p><p>He was about Gideon\u2019s height, so I stopped before I hit the bottom stair so that we were briefly at eye level. \u201cYou ever consider moving to New York, Doc?\u201d</p><p>He smiled his crooked smile. \u201cAs if California taxes aren\u2019t bad enough.\u201d</p><p>I sighed dramatically. \u201cI had to try.\u201d</p><p>His arm slung around my shoulders when I joined him courtside. \u201cSo did Cary. I\u2019m flattered.\u201d</p><p>We went to his office. I shut the door while he nabbed a dinged metal chair and spun it around to sit facing backward with his arms draped along the backrest. It was one of his quirks. He sat in the desk chair when he was just hanging out; he straddled the relic when he got down to business.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your fianc\u00e9,\u201d he said, when I took my usual spot on the green vinyl sofa that was held together with duct tape and decorated with signatures of former and existing patients.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I chided. \u201cWe both know Cary filled you in.\u201d</p><p>Cary always started his sessions with talk about my life and me. That eventually dovetailed into talk about him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know who Gideon Cross is.\u201d Dr. Travis tapped his feet in that way he had that somehow never seemed restless or impatient. \u201cBut I want to hear about the man you\u2019re going to marry.\u201d</p><p>I thought for a minute and he sat quietly while I did, not waiting, just observing. \u201cGideon is . . . God, he\u2019s so many things. He\u2019s complicated. We have some issues to work out, but we\u2019ll get there. My more immediate problem is the feelings I\u2019m having for this singer I used to . . . see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrett Kline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary reminded me, but I remember our discussions about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d I looked at my stunning wedding ring, twisting it around my finger. \u201cI\u2019m so in love with Gideon. He\u2019s changed my life in so many ways. He makes me feel beautiful and precious. I know it seems too fast, but he\u2019s the one for me.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Travis smiled. \u201cIt was love at first sight for me and my wife. We were in high school when we met, but I knew she was the girl I was going to marry.\u201d</p><p>My gaze drifted to the pictures of his wife on his desk. There was one when she was younger, and another more recent. The office itself was a mess of papers, sports equipment, books, and ancient posters of bygone sports personalities, but the frames and glass protecting the photos were spotless.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Brett has any effect on me at all. It\u2019s not that I want him. I can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else but Gideon. Sexually or otherwise. But I\u2019m not indifferent to Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you be?\u201d he asked simply. \u201cHe was a part of your life at a pivotal time, and the end of your relationship caused a bit of an epiphany for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy . . . interest\u2014that\u2019s not the right word\u2014doesn\u2019t feel like nostalgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t. I would guess you\u2019re feeling some regret. Thinking about what-ifs. It was a highly sexual relationship for you, so there may be some lingering attraction, even if you know you\u2019d never go there again.\u201d</p><p>I was almost sure he was right about that.</p><p>His fingertips drummed on the back of the chair. \u201cYou said your fianc\u00e9 is a complicated man and you\u2019re working on some issues. Brett was very simple. You knew what you were getting with him. In the last few months, you\u2019ve had a big move, you\u2019re closer to your mother, and you\u2019re engaged. You may, occasionally, wish things were simpler.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him as that sank in. \u201cHow do you make sense like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice.\u201d</p><p>Fear made me say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to screw things up with Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have someone you\u2019re talking with in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in couples therapy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPractical. That\u2019s good. He wants it to work, too. Does he know?\u201d</p><p>About Nathan? \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to avoid Brett, but I wonder if that means I\u2019m not dealing with the root of the problem. Like an alcoholic who doesn\u2019t drink is still an alcoholic. The problem is still there, they\u2019re just staying away from it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot quite true, but interesting that you\u2019d use an addiction analogy. You\u2019re prone to self-destructive behavior with men. A lot of individuals with your history are, so it\u2019s not unexpected and we\u2019ve addressed that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That was why I was so afraid of getting lost in Gideon.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few things you have to consider,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged to a man who, on the surface, is very much the sort of man your mother would want for you. Considering how you feel about your mother\u2019s dependence on men, there might be some resistance you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>My nose wrinkled.</p> <p>He wagged his finger at me. \u201cAh, a possibility? The other is that you might not feel you deserve what you\u2019ve found with him.\u201d</p><p>A rock settled in my gut. \u201cAnd I deserve Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He gave me a kind smile. \u201cThe fact you\u2019re even asking that question . . . that\u2019s your problem right there.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>\u201cI DIDN\u2019T EVEN recognize you without the suit and tie,\u201d Sam Yimara said, as I settled into the seat across from him. He was a compact man, well shy of six feet in height but muscled. His head was shaved and tattooed, his earlobes pierced so that I could see right through them.</p> <p>Pete\u2019s 69th Street Bar wasn\u2019t located on Sixty-ninth Street, so I had no idea where the name originated. I did understand that Six-Ninths had derived their name from it, after playing on its stage for a number of years. I also understood that the restrooms in the back had provided a place for Brett Kline to screw my wife.</p><p>I wanted to lay my fists into him for that. She deserved palaces and private islands, not seedy bar bathroom stalls.</p><p>Pete\u2019s wasn\u2019t quite a dive, but it was classless. A beach bar that looked best under cover of darkness and known mostly as a place for SDSU students to hook up and drink \u2019til they couldn\u2019t remember what they did or whom they fucked.</p><p>After I tore the place to the ground, they wouldn\u2019t remember the bar, either.</p><p>The choice in venue was deliberate and quite brilliant on Yimara\u2019s part. It put me on edge and drove home what was at stake. If my decision to show up alone and dressed in jeans and T-shirt threw him off in return, I\u2019d consider the challenge well met.</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, watching him carefully. The bar had a few patrons, most of whom were seated on the patio. Only a handful of us occupied the beach-themed interior. \u201cHave you decided to accept my offer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve considered it.\u201d He crossed his legs and angled so that he could lay his arm along his seat back. Overconfident and not smart enough to exercise caution. \u201cBut hey, considering what you\u2019re valued at, I\u2019m surprised Eva\u2019s privacy isn\u2019t worth more than a million dollars to you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled inwardly. \u201cEva\u2019s peace of mind is priceless to me. But if you think I\u2019ll up my offer, you aren\u2019t thinking clearly. The injunction against you will go through. And then there\u2019s the pesky little detail regarding the legality of filming Eva without her consent, a very different scenario from a mutually agreed-upon private sex tape gone public.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cI thought you wanted to keep this quiet, not make it part of public record. Eva would be on her own with any lawsuit, you know. I\u2019ve already talked to Brett and we\u2019ve worked things out.\u201d</p><p>Tension tightened my shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s seen the footage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has it.\u201d Sam reached into his pocket and pulled out a flash drive. \u201cHere\u2019s a copy for Eva. I figured you should see what you\u2019re paying for.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Kline viewing sexual images of Eva sent rage surging through me. His memories were bad enough. A recording was unacceptable.</p><p>My hand fisted around the flash drive. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come out that the footage exists; I can\u2019t stop it. You contacted too many reporters with your offer to sell it. What I can do is destroy you. Personally, that would be my preference. I want to watch you burn, you piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>Sam shifted in his seat.</p> <p>I leaned forward. \u201cYou got more than Eva and Kline with your cameras. There are dozens of other victims who didn\u2019t sign releases. I own this bar. Hell, I own the band. It didn\u2019t take much effort to find the regulars and Six-Ninths followers who were here when you were illegally filming in the bathrooms.\u201d</p><p>The last bit of avarice in his gaze dimmed, then blinked out completely.</p><p>\u201cIf you were smarter,\u201d I went on, \u201cyou would\u2019ve leveraged for long-term gain instead of an immediate payout. Instead, you\u2019re going to sign the contract I\u2019m about to put in front of you and walk away with a check for a quarter million.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cFuck that! You said one million. That was the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you didn\u2019t accept.\u201d I stood. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer on the table. And if you take any longer to decide, the new offer won\u2019t be, either. I\u2019ll just run you into the ground and straight into a jail cell. It\u2019s enough that I can tell Eva I tried.\u201d</p><p>As I walked away, I shoved the flash drive into my pocket, where it promptly burned a hole I couldn\u2019t ignore. My gaze met Arash\u2019s as I passed where he sat at the bar waiting for his cue to step in.</p><p>He hopped off his bar stool. \u201cAlways a pleasure watching you scare the hell out of someone,\u201d he said, before heading toward the seat I\u2019d just vacated, the necessary contract and check in hand.</p><p>I stepped outside the dim bar into the bright San Diego sunshine. Eva didn\u2019t want me to view the footage; she\u2019d made me promise I wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>But she was feeling something for Kline. He remained a very real threat. Seeing them together, intimately, might give me the information I needed to fight him off.</p><p>Had she been as sexually raw with him as she was with me? Had she been as desperate and greedy for him? Could he make her come like I could?</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut against the images in my head, but they wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>Remembering my promise, I crossed the parking lot to my rental car.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Is it silly that I\u2019m nearly as excited to be your \u201cfriend\u201d as I am to be your wife?</p><p>I laughed inwardly as I read Eva\u2019s text and replied. I\u2019m as excited to be your lover as I am to be your husband.</p><p>OMG . . . fiend.</p><p>That had me laughing aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that sound?\u201d Arash looked at me over the edge of his tablet, having made himself at home on the couch in my hotel suite. \u201cWas that a laugh, Cross? Were you seriously just laughing? Or were you having a stroke?\u201d</p><p>I flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d he shot back. \u201cThe finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva says it\u2019s a classic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2019s hot enough to get away with it. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>I opened a new window on my laptop and logged into my social media profile, linking it to Eva\u2019s with the Engaged to designation now that we were \u201cfriends.\u201d As I waited for her to accept the relationship link, I clicked on her profile and smiled again at the cover image she\u2019d selected. She was exposing herself to the world for the first time, and she was doing so as the woman who was mine.</p><p>I texted her back when she approved our joined status. Now you\u2019re both.</p><p>I\u2019m keeping my half of our deal.</p><p>My gaze moved from the message window to the photo of us on her profile. I brushed over her face with my fingertips, resisting the urge to go to her. It was too soon. She needed what space I could bear to give her.</p><p>So am I, angel mine.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE theater in the casino wasn\u2019t a huge venue, but it wasn\u2019t small, either, and it was easier to fill. It was better for Six-Ninths to boast sold-out concerts than to risk embarrassingly empty seats, even in their hometown. Christopher would\u2019ve thought of that.</p><p>My brother was good at what he did. I\u2019d learned not to tell him so, though. It only made him more of an asshole.</p><p>As the rows of seats slowly emptied, I made my way toward backstage. Not my turf, despite the all-access pass I carried as primary shareholder of Vidal Records. Kline definitely had the advantage.</p><p>But I hadn\u2019t been able to stay away until morning, even though I knew it was the wiser move. Then, he\u2019d be exhausted. Possibly hungover. I would have the upper hand then.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait that long. He had the footage. He would\u2019ve watched it at least once. Maybe more than that. I couldn\u2019t stomach the thought of him watching it again. Getting it away from him was the most important thing on my agenda.</p><p>And I wanted him to know I was close by before he met with Eva. I was marking my territory, so to speak, and I chose to do so in the jeans and T-shirt I\u2019d worn when I met Yimara. Anything to do with Eva was a personal matter, not business, and I wanted that to be clear the moment Kline saw me.</p><p>I entered stage left and walked straight into chaos. Scantily clad women fucked up on their drug or booze of choice lined the scuffed, narrow corridor. Dozens of tattooed and pierced men broke down and packed up equipment with efficient, practiced skill and speed. Hard-grinding music piped out of hidden speakers, clashing with the tunes spilling out of individual rooms. I weaved through the pandemonium, searching for a distinctive head of frosted spikes.</p><p>An achingly familiar blonde stumbled out of an open doorway several feet away, her hair falling around her shoulders and drawing attention to the lush curves of a great ass.</p><p>My footsteps slowed. My heartbeat quickened. Kline followed her out, a beer in one hand and the other reaching for her. She caught it and pulled him out into the wing.</p><p>I knew how that delicate hand felt, how smooth the skin was. How firm the grip. I knew how those nails felt digging into my back. How those fingers tugged at my hair as she came against my mouth. The electric sizzle of her touch. The primal awareness.</p><p>I stood frozen, my gut knotting. She stood close, too close, to Kline. Her shoulder leaned against the wall. Her hip was cocked provocatively, her fingertips brushing suggestively over Kline\u2019s stomach. He gave her a cocky, flirtatious smile, his hand rubbing her upper arm in a far too intimate way.</p><p>No one who saw them together could mistake that they were lovers.</p><p>Rage fired my blood. A sick darkness radiated through me.</p><p>Pain. Searing and soul deep. It took my breath and every ounce of control.</p><p>A woman\u2019s arm draped over my shoulder. Her hand slid beneath the neck of my T-shirt to touch my chest, while her other wrapped around my hip to stroke my dick. Cloying perfume assaulted my nose, spurring me to shrug her off violently even as a model-thin brunette with heavily made-up blue eyes tried to sandwich me from the front.</p><p>\u201cBack off!\u201d I growled, glaring at both in a way that had them stumbling back and calling me an asshole.</p><p>In another time, I would\u2019ve fucked them both, turning the feel of being hunted into one of complete control.</p><p>I\u2019d learned how to handle sexual predators after Hugh. How to put them in their place.</p><p>I surged forward, pushing through the crowd, remembering the feel of Kline\u2019s jaw against my fist. The unforgiving hardness of his torso. The grunt of air leaving his body when I hit him with everything I had.</p><p>I wanted him laid out and battered. Bloody. Broken.</p><p>Kline bent over her, speaking close to her ear. My hands clenched. She threw her head back and laughed, and I stumbled to a halt. Startled and confused. Despite the volume of noise, the sound struck me as wrong.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Eva\u2019s laugh.</p><p>It was too high. My wife\u2019s laugh was low and throaty. Sexy. As unique as the woman it belonged to.</p><p>The blonde turned her head and I saw her in profile. She wasn\u2019t Eva. The body and hair were similar. Not the face.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>My mind caught up with reality. The girl was the one from the \u201cGolden\u201d music video. The Eva stand-in.</p><p>Roadies and groupies filtered around me, but I remained fixed in place as Kline caressed and seduced a pale imitation of my incomparable wife.</p><p>My phone vibrated in my pocket, startling me. I cursed and pulled it out, reading the text from Ra\u00fal: She just arrived at the casino.</p><p>So, she\u2019d changed her mind about seeing Kline. Working the situation to my benefit, I typed back: Get her to the left wing now.</p><p>Got it.</p><p>I backed up against the wall, sidestepping into an alcove half hidden by steel equipment cases stacked on hand trucks. The minutes ticked by slowly.</p><p>I sensed her before I saw her, felt the frisson of recognition. Turning my head, I found her easily. Unlike her imitator, who wore a small tight dress, Eva was dressed in jeans that hugged every curve and a simple gray tank top. She wore heeled sandals and hoop earrings, casual and relaxed.</p><p>Hunger hit me with brutal force. She was the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen and easily the sexiest woman alive. Other women turned their heads to follow her when she walked by, envying her effortless beauty and sexuality. Men eyed her with heated interest, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice, her attention on Kline.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed as she took in the same scene I had moments earlier. I watched her assess the situation and knew when she reached the same conclusion I had. A myriad of emotions crossed her face. It had to be odd for her, seeing a former lover so desperate to recapture what he\u2019d once had with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was inconceivable to me. If I couldn\u2019t have Eva, I would have no one.</p><p>Her shoulders went back. Her chin lifted. Then a smile curved her mouth. I could see the acceptance settle over her, a new kind of peace. Whatever she\u2019d needed, she had found it.</p><p>Eva passed by without spotting me, but Ra\u00fal joined me.</p><p>\u201cAwkward,\u201d he said, his attention on Kline as the singer looked up and spotted my wife, his body visibly stiffening.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I replied, as my wife greeted Kline by extending her left hand to him. My ring on her finger sparkled brilliantly, impossible to miss. \u201cKeep me posted.\u201d</p><p>I left.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>AS my muscles burned through my eightieth push-up, my gaze was on the flash drive lying on the carpet in front of me. The way I\u2019d dealt with Yimara and Kline had been effective but unsatisfying. I was still tense and aggravated, spoiling for a fight.</p><p>My eyes stung as rivulets of sweat ran down my forehead. My chest heaved with exertion. Knowing Eva was out clubbing with Cary and some of their SoCal friends only sharpened the edge I hovered on. I knew how primed she got when out drinking and dancing. I loved nailing her when her body was damp and steamy with perspiration, her cunt slick and greedy.</p><p>Jesus. My dick throbbed and hardened further. My arms trembled as I neared the point of muscle fatigue. Veins stood out in harsh relief along my forearms and hands. I needed a cold shower, but I wouldn\u2019t get myself off. I always saved it for Eva. Every thick, creamy drop.</p><p>The message app on my laptop pinged and I slowed the vicious pace, hitting one hundred before I pushed to my feet. I grabbed the flash drive and dropped it on the desk, then retrieved the towel I\u2019d hung over the back of the chair. Wiping my face before opening the window on my laptop, I expected to read the latest update on Eva\u2019s evening. What I saw was a text from her.</p><p>What room are you in?</p><p>I stared at the screen for a moment, processing the question. Another ping announced a text from Ra\u00fal: She\u2019s heading toward your hotel.</p><p>Anticipation shifted my focus from working out to my delectable, clever wife. I typed a reply to her: 4269.</p><p>I reached for the phone on the desk and called room service. \u201cA bottle of Cristal,\u201d I ordered. \u201cTwo flutes, strawberries, and whipped cream. Have it here in ten. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Returning the receiver to its base, I slung the towel around the back of my neck. A quick glance at the clock told me it was half past two in the morning.</p><p>By the time the doorbell chimed, I\u2019d turned on all the lights in both the living room and bedroom and opened the curtains that had been blocking the view of the moonlit ocean.</p><p>I went to the door and opened it, finding both Eva and room service waiting. Dressed as I\u2019d seen her earlier, Eva looked like a bad girl, renewing my hard-on in an instant. Her hair was limp and her face shiny, her mascara running slightly. She smelled like clean sweat and alcohol.</p><p>If the server hadn\u2019t been standing behind her, I would\u2019ve had her on her back on the foyer tile before she knew what hit her.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d she breathed, eyeing me from head to toe.</p><p>I glanced down. I was still overheated, my skin shiny with sweat. The waistband of my sweats was wet with it, drawing attention to the erection I didn\u2019t even try to will away. \u201cSorry, you caught me midworkout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in San Diego?\u201d she demanded from the hallway.</p><p>Stepping back, I gestured for her to come in.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not getting sucked into your sex-god vortex until you answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here on business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Her arms crossed.</p><p>Reaching out, I caught her by the elbow and tugged her in. \u201cI can prove it.\u201d</p><p>Room service rolled the cart in after her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re way too optimistic,\u201d she muttered, looking at the order as I signed the receipt.</p><p>I handed the bill and stylus back, waited for the server to leave, then walked over to the phone by the sofa. I dialed Arash\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d he answered, sounding groggy. \u201cSome of us sleep, Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sheets rustled. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my room.\u201d I held the receiver out to Eva. \u201cMy attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s five in the morning in New York! On a Sunday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the room next door. Take it. Ask him if I\u2019ve been working today.\u201d</p><p>She marched over and snatched the phone out of my hand. \u201cYou should get a new job,\u201d she told him. \u201cYour boss is insane.\u201d</p><p>He replied and she sighed. \u201cBefore.\u201d She glanced at me. \u201cThank God he\u2019s hot. Still, I might get my head checked. Sorry he woke you up. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Eva held the phone out to me.</p><p>I took it and put it to my ear. \u201cAs she said, go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her. She gives you shit.\u201d</p><p>My gaze slid over her. \u201cI like her, too. Good night.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and reached for her.</p><p>She backed up, avoiding my grasp. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want to cramp your style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. \u201cAsks the wife who tracked my phone to my hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just curious if you were staying in the penthouse or not!\u201d</p><p>She pouted when I only continued to eye her. \u201cAnd . . . I missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, angel.\u201d I opened my arms to her. \u201cCome and get me.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cI have to shower. I stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both sweaty.\u201d I went to her. This time, she didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cAnd I love the way you smell. You know that.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands on her waist, sliding them up until I hugged her delicate rib cage just beneath the full swell of her tits. I cupped them through her top, gently hefting their weight, squeezing softly.</p><p>I\u2019d never had a fetish for particular parts of the female body, until Eva. I worshipped every inch of her, cherished all of her generous curves.</p><p>The pads of my thumbs circled her nipples, feeling them harden. \u201cI love the way you feel.\u201d</p><p>Lowering my head, I found the crook of her neck and nuzzled her, rubbing my damp hair against her.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cNo fair. You\u2019re all ripped and shiny and mostly naked, and I have no willpower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need any.\u201d I pushed my hands beneath her tank and freed the clasp of her bra. \u201cLet me have you, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a slow, deep breath as she reached under the elastic of my waistband and gripped my cock.</p><p>\u201cYum,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLook what I found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d I cupped her ass. \u201cTell me you want it exactly the way I want to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at me with heavy-lidded eyes. \u201cAnd how would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. On the floor. Your jeans caught around one ankle, your shirt pushed up, your underwear shoved to the side. I want my cock inside you, my cum filling you.\u201d I slid my tongue along the racing pulse in her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you once I get you to bed, but right now . . . I just want to use you.\u201d</p><p>She trembled. \u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>Banding one arm behind her thighs, I pulled her feet out from under her and lowered her carefully to the carpet. My mouth found hers soft and hot and wet, her tongue licking mine. Her arms wrapped around my neck, trying to hold me. I let her, my knees straddling her hips, my fingers opening her jeans.</p><p>Her belly was flat and silky smooth, concaving with a giggle when my knuckles brushed her sides. Her ticklishness made me smile into our kiss, joy filling my chest until it felt too small to contain it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me,\u201d I told her. \u201cWake up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her hips lifted to help me yank her pants down.</p><p>I freed one leg and left the other trapped, my hands pushing her thighs open so I could see her. Her panties were skewed from pulling off her jeans, giving her just the look I wanted.</p><p>She was my wife. My most valuable possession; I treasured her. But I loved her slutty and dirty, too. A sexual object for my pleasure. The one woman who could silence the memories in my head and set me free.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d I slid down, lying prone, my mouth watering for the taste of her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested, her hands covering herself.</p><p>I pinned her wrists at her sides and glared. \u201cI want you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>I licked her through the silk and she arched with a whimper, her heels digging into the carpet and lifting her cunt to my mouth. I pulled her panties aside with my teeth and uncovered the impossibly soft skin. A rough sound left me, my dick hardening to the point of pain.</p><p>Wrapping my lips around her clit, I sucked her, licked her. Felt her tense up. I released her hands, knowing she was mine now, helpless to fight me.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she breathed, writhing. \u201cYour mouth . . .\u201d</p><p>Spreading her wide with my shoulders, I tongued her, driving her to come. Her fingers pulled at my hair, tugging painfully at the roots, spurring me on until she climaxed with a startled cry. I licked inside her, fucking her, feeling her quiver around my tongue. She grew slicker, hotter.</p><p>I rubbed against her clit and slid two fingers inside her, grinding my hips into the floor at the feel of her tight plushness. My cock ached to sink into that snug heat, knowing how amazing it felt, craving the constriction.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Eva begged, grinding into the thrust of my fingers, needing the slide of my dick to fill her.</p><p>I wanted to fuck. To come. Not because I needed sex, but because I needed her.</p><p>Her body twisted and tensed with another orgasm, her neck arching as she cried out.</p><p>Wiping my wet mouth on her inner thigh, I rose to my knees and shoved my sweats down. I placed one hand on the floor and used the other to aim my cock, levering over her and notching the throbbing head against her. I thrust hard, putting the weight of my body behind it, surging through the tight clasp with a groan.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d I rubbed my sweat-slick forehead against her cheek, wanting her to smell like me. Her nails were in my back, digging in. I wanted them to mark me, scar me.</p><p>Cupping her ass, I lifted her, angled her, digging my feet into the carpet for the leverage I needed to push all the way in. Eva gasped and churned her hips, working to fit me.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d I hissed through clenched teeth, fighting the need to come before she took all of my cock. \u201cLet me in.\u201d</p><p>Her cunt rippled, sucking at me. I pinned her shoulder to hold her still and thrust harder. She gave, letting me have her.</p><p>The feel of her clutching the entire length of my dick was all I needed. Wrapping myself around her, I held her against me, kissing her roughly, coming with a violence that left me trembling in her arms.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>STEAM curled around us as I cradled Eva in the suite\u2019s massive sunken tub. Her wet hair clung to my chest, her arms draped over mine where they hugged her waist.</p><p>\u201cAce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I pressed my lips to her temple.</p><p>\u201cIf we couldn\u2019t be together\u2014not that it would ever happen, just hypothetically\u2014would you sleep with someone who looked like me? I mean, I know I\u2019m not your usual type, but would you want to pretend with someone who reminded you of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate on situations that will never occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She leaned to the side, tilting her head back to look at me. \u201cI get it. I tried to think if I would find any comfort in being with someone similar to you. Like maybe if it was dark and his hair was your length\u2014\u201d</p><p>My hold tightened. \u201cEva. Don\u2019t tell me about fantasies of other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. As usual, you\u2019re not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this about?\u201d I knew, of course. But there were no avenues in the topic I wanted to explore.</p><p>\u201cBrett\u2019s sleeping with that girl from the \u2018Golden\u2019 video. The one who looks like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one looks like you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe may have your curves,\u201d I conceded, \u201cbut she doesn\u2019t sound like you. She doesn\u2019t have your sense of humor, your wit. She doesn\u2019t have your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I brushed wet fingertips over her brow. \u201cTurning off the lights wouldn\u2019t help me at all. A random, stacked blonde wouldn\u2019t smell like you. She wouldn\u2019t move the way you do. She wouldn\u2019t touch me the same way, need me the same way.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened and she pressed her cheek against my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too. I couldn\u2019t do it. And the moment I saw Brett with that girl, I knew that you wouldn\u2019t do it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with anyone. Ever.\u201d I kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve changed what sex means to me, Eva. I couldn\u2019t go back. I wouldn\u2019t even try.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shifted around to straddle me, sending water sloshing up and over the rim of the tub. I looked at her, taking in the slicked-back hair the color of wheat, the smudges left by her makeup, the sheen of water on her golden skin.</p><p>Her fingers massaged the nape of my neck. \u201cMy dad wants to pay for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he now?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI need you to be okay with that.\u201d</p><p>I was okay with anything when I had my naked, wet, and frisky wife wrapped around me. \u201cI\u2019ve had the wedding I wanted. You can do whatever you like this time around.\u201d</p><p>Her brilliant smile and enthusiastic kiss were all the reward I needed. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her closer.</p><p>She bit her lower lip, then said, \u201cMy mom is going to have a fit. She can blow through fifty thousand dollars in just flowers and invitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell your parents your dad is paying for the wedding and your mom can pitch in for the reception. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. I like that. You\u2019re handy to have around, Mr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I lifted her and licked across her nipple. \u201cLet me prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE bedroom was lightening with the coming dawn when Eva\u2019s breathing settled into the deep, even rhythm of sleep. I extricated myself from both her arms and the sheets as carefully as possible, standing beside the bed to watch her. Her hair was tumbled around her shoulders, her lips and cheeks flushed from sex. I rubbed my chest, pained by how tight it had become.</p><p>Leaving her like this was always hard and became more difficult by the day. My skin hurt from being parted from hers.</p><p>I closed the curtains in the bedroom, then moved into the living room and did the same there, plunging the room into darkness.</p><p>Then I settled on the sofa and fell asleep.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>A sudden flash of light woke me. Blinking, I scrubbed at my gritty eyes and saw that the curtains had been parted to send sunlight shafting across my face. Eva walked toward me, the light haloing around her naked body.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she whispered, sinking to her knees beside me. \u201cYou said I\u2019d wake up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I looked at my watch, saw I\u2019d only been asleep an hour and a half. \u201cYou were supposed to sleep longer.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips to my abs. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep well without you.\u201d</p><p>Regret pierced me. My wife needed things I couldn\u2019t give her. She woke me with light instead of a touch because she feared my reaction. She was right to be cautious. In the grip of a nightmare, the stroke of a hand might have me waking up with fists flying.</p><p>I brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d For everything. For all you\u2019re giving up to be with me.</p> <p>\u201cShh.\u201d She lifted the elastic waistband of my sweats and pushed it down past my cock. I was hard for her. How could I help it when she came to me naked and sleepy-eyed?</p><p>Her mouth wrapped around the head of my dick.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut and groaned, surrendering.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>KNOCKING at the door woke me the next time. Eva stirred in my arms, cuddled against me on the narrow stretch of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d I muttered, pulling her tighter against me.</p><p>\u201cIgnore it.\u201d</p><p>The knocking continued.</p><p>I leaned my head back and yelled, \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come bearing coffee and croissants,\u201d Arash shouted back. \u201cOpen up, Cross, it\u2019s after noon and I want to meet your lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>Eva blinked up at me. \u201cYour lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d I sat up and shoved my hands through my hair. \u201cWe\u2019re going away, you and me. Soon. Far away.\u201d</p><p>She kissed the small of my back. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>I shoved my feet into the legs of my sweats, then stood to pull them up. Eva took the opportunity to smack me on the bare ass.</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Arash yelled. \u201cCut it out and open up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d I told him, striding toward the door. I glanced back to tell Eva to cover herself, but she was already running into the bedroom.</p><p>I found Arash waiting outside my suite with a room service cart. \u201cWhat the fuck is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>I had to back out of the way before he rolled right through me.</p><p>\u201cQuit your bitching.\u201d He grinned, pushing the cart off to the side and raking me with a glance. \u201cSave the marathon sex for your honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him!\u201d Eva shouted through the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d I turned away from him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t work for me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold it against me,\u201d Arash said, following me into the living room. \u201cWow. Your back looks like you got into a brawl with a mountain lion. No wonder you\u2019re tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I snatched my shirt off the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me Eva was in San Diego, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was none of your business.\u201d</p><p>He held up both hands in surrender. \u201cTruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word about Yimara,\u201d I told him quietly. \u201cI won\u2019t have her worrying about that.\u201d</p><p>Arash sobered. \u201cIt\u2019s done. I won\u2019t mention it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I went to the cart and poured two cups of coffee, preparing Eva\u2019s the way she liked it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a cup,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cServe yourself.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved wryly as he joined me. \u201cIs she coming out?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mad, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d I took both mugs to the coffee table, then went to the wall where the controls for the drapes were. \u201cIt takes some work to piss her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at it.\u201d He smiled and settled into one of the armchairs. \u201cI recall that viral video of you two scrapping in Bryant Park.\u201d</p><p>I shot him a look as sunlight began pouring into the room. \u201cYou must really hate your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you wouldn\u2019t be curious if I eloped with a chick I knew only a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d send her my condolences.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>The bedroom door opened and Eva stepped out dressed in her clothes from the night before. Her face was freshly washed, but the dark circles under her eyes and her swollen mouth made her look both well fucked and extremely fuckable. With her bare feet and barely tamed hair, she was stunning.</p><p>Pride swelled my chest. Uncovered by the lack of makeup, the dusting of freckles on her nose made her adorable. Her body told you she was a dream to fuck, the confidence in her posture told you she\u2019d take no shit from anyone, and the mischievous amusement in her eyes told you there would never be a dull moment.</p><p>She was every promise, every hope, every fantasy a man could have. And she was mine.</p><p>I stared. Arash stared, too.</p><p>Eva shifted her stance and smiled shyly. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her voice snapped him out of it. He pushed to his feet so quickly he spilled his coffee. \u201cShit. Sorry. Hi.\u201d</p><p>He set his mug down and brushed the stray droplets off his pants. He went to her and held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Arash.\u201d</p><p>She shook it. \u201cNice to meet you, Arash. I\u2019m Eva.\u201d</p><p>I joined them, pushing Arash back with my forearm. \u201cStop drooling.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cFunny, Cross, you ass.\u201d</p><p>Eva laughed and leaned into me when I slid my arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see he works with people who aren\u2019t afraid of him,\u201d she said.</p><p>Arash winked, blatantly flirting. \u201cI know how he operates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019d love to hear all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d I drawled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a spoilsport, ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ace,\u201d Arash taunted. \u201cWhat have you got to hide?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYour corpse.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my wife and sighed. \u201cSee what I have to deal with?\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>A LATE-AFTERNOON OUTDOOR lunch, in beautiful San Diego, with the three most important men in my life definitely ranked at the top of my best-moments-ever list. I sat between Gideon and my dad, while Cary lounged in the seat directly across the table from me.</p><p>If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have said I was apathetic about palm trees. I had a new appreciation for them now that I hadn\u2019t seen one in a while. I watched them sway gently in the warm ocean breeze and felt the kind of peace I chased but rarely caught. Seagulls competed with pigeons for the scraps under tables, while the not-too-distant crash of waves against the beach underpinned the bustle of the packed restaurant.</p><p>My best friend\u2019s mirrored shades hid his eyes, but his smile came often and easy. My dad wore shorts and a T-shirt and had started out the meal unusually quiet. He\u2019d loosened up after a beer and now looked as comfortable as Cary. My husband wore tan cargo pants and a white T-shirt, the first time I\u2019d ever seen him in light-colored clothing. He looked cool and relaxed in aviators, his fingers linked with mine on the arm of my chair.</p><p>\u201cAn early-evening wedding,\u201d I thought aloud. \u201cAround sunset. Just family and close friends.\u201d I looked at Cary. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the man of honor, of course.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curled up on one side in a lazy smile. \u201cI better be.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Gideon. \u201cDo you know who you\u2019ll ask to stand with you?\u201d</p><p>The tightening of his lips was nearly imperceptible, but I caught it. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>My happy mood dimmed a little. Was he debating whether Arnoldo would be suitable, considering the chef\u2019s feelings toward me? It made me sad to think I might strain that relationship.</p><p>Gideon was such a private person. Although I didn\u2019t know for sure, I suspected he was tight with his friends but that there weren\u2019t many of them.</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Ireland to be a bridesmaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do about Christopher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. With luck, he won\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>My dad frowned. \u201cWho are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2019s brother and sister,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get along with your brother, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>I explained, not wanting my dad to hold anything against my husband. \u201cChristopher\u2019s not a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s head turned toward me. He didn\u2019t say it aloud, but I got the message: He didn\u2019t want me speaking for him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a total douche, you mean,\u201d Cary interjected. \u201cNo offense, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d He shrugged and then elaborated for my father. \u201cChristopher views me as a competitor. I\u2019d have it differently, but it\u2019s not my choice.\u201d</p><p>My dad nodded slowly. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re discussing the wedding,\u201d Gideon segued smoothly, \u201cit would be my pleasure to provide transportation. It would give me a chance to contribute, which I\u2019d appreciate.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, understanding\u2014as I knew my father would\u2014that my husband\u2019s directness and tact made him hard to refuse.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous of you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a standing offer. With an hour\u2019s notice, we can have you in the air and on your way. It\u2019ll make it easier for you and Eva to work around your schedules and maximize your time together.\u201d</p><p>My dad didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cThank you. It might take me a while to get used to the idea. It\u2019s a bit extravagant, and I don\u2019t want to be a burden.\u201d</p><p>Gideon pulled his shades off, baring his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what money\u2019s for. All I want is to make your daughter happy. Make that easy on me, Mr. Reyes. We all want to see Eva smiling as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>It sank in then why my dad was so opposed to Stanton paying for anything. My stepdad didn\u2019t do it for me; he did it for my mom. Gideon would only ever consider me when making decisions. I knew my dad could live with that.</p><p>I caught Gideon\u2019s gaze and mouthed, I love you.</p><p>His grip on my hand tightened until it hurt. I didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>My dad smiled. \u201cMaking Eva happy. How can I argue with that?\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE smell of freshly brewed coffee brought my well-trained senses to life the following morning. I blinked up at the bedroom ceiling of my Upper West Side apartment and gave a sleepy smile when I discovered Gideon standing beside my bed, stripping out of his shirt. The sight of his leanly muscular torso and washboard abs almost made up for the fact that I\u2019d obviously spent the night alone after falling asleep in his arms.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I murmured, rolling onto my side as he pushed his pajama bottoms down and kicked them off.</p><p>Whoever said Mondays sucked had obviously never woken up to a naked Gideon Cross.</p><p>\u201cIt will be,\u201d he said, lifting the covers and sliding between the sheets with me.</p><p>I shivered as his cool skin touched mine. \u201cYikes!\u201d</p><p>His arms slipped around me, and his lips touched my neck. \u201cWarm me up, angel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time I was done with him he was sweating and the coffee he\u2019d brought me was cold.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mind in the least.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I was in an excellent mood when I got to work. Morning sex contributed to that, of course. Also the sight of Gideon getting dressed for the day, watching him transform from the private man I knew and loved into the dark and dangerous global magnate. The day only got better when I exited on the twentieth floor and saw Megumi sitting at her desk.</p> <p>I waved at her through the glass security doors, but my smile faded the moment I got a good look at her. She was pale and had dark circles under her eyes. Her usually sassy asymmetrical haircut looked limp and overlong, and she was wearing a long-sleeved blouse and dark slacks that were out of place with the August mugginess.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I greeted her when she buzzed me through. \u201cHow are you? I\u2019ve been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m totally antisocial when I get sick. I just want to curl up in bed and be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered and her eyes grew shiny with tears.</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I glanced around, worried about her privacy as other employees passed through the reception area. \u201cDid you see a doctor?\u201d</p><p>She started crying.</p><p>Horrified, I stood frozen for a minute. \u201cMegumi. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She pulled off her headset and stood, tears spilling down her face. She shook her head violently. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is your break?\u201d</p><p>But she was already hurrying to the bathroom, leaving me staring after her.</p> <p>\u2014</p><p>I headed to my cubicle and dropped off my bag, then went down the hall to Will Granger\u2019s desk. He wasn\u2019t there, but I found him in the break room when I stopped to grab some coffee.</p><p>\u201cHey, you.\u201d His eyes behind his square-framed glasses looked as worried as I felt. \u201cDid you see Megumi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She looks wiped out. And she started crying when I asked how she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>He slid the carton of half-and-half over to me. \u201cNot good, whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bad with not knowing. My imagination runs wild. I\u2019m bouncing between cancer, pregnancy, and everything in between.\u201d</p><p>Will shrugged helplessly. With his neatly trimmed sideburns and subtly quirky-patterned shirts, he was the sort of affable and easy-natured guy who was hard to dislike.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Mark stuck his head in the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got news.\u201d</p> <p>My boss\u2019s bright eyes told me he was excited about something. \u201cI\u2019m all ears. Coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks. See you in my office.\u201d He ducked back out again.</p><p>Will grabbed his mug off the counter. \u201cHave a good one.\u201d</p><p>He left. I hurried to get the coffee ready, then went to Mark\u2019s office. He\u2019d taken his jacket off and was studying something on his monitor. He looked up, smiling when he saw me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a new RFP request.\u201d His smile widened. \u201cAnd they asked for me specifically.\u201d</p><p>I tensed. Setting his coffee down, I asked warily, \u201cIs it another Cross Industries product?\u201d</p><p>As much as I loved Gideon and admired all that he\u2019d accomplished, I didn\u2019t want to be totally overshadowed by his world. Part of who we were as a couple was two people who had separate working lives. I enjoyed riding to work with my husband, but I needed to say good-bye to him, too. I needed those few hours when he didn\u2019t consume me.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s bigger.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. I couldn\u2019t think of anything or anyone bigger than Cross Industries.</p><p>Mark slid a picture of a silver-and-red box across the desk to me. \u201cIt\u2019s the new PhazeOne gaming system from LanCorp.\u201d</p><p>I settled into the seat in front of his desk with an inner sigh of relief. \u201cSweet. Sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>IT was a little after eleven when Megumi called to see if I was free for lunch.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cSomeplace quiet.\u201d</p><p>I considered our options. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea. Leave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I sat at my desk. \u201cHow\u2019s your morning been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusy. I have to get caught up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know if I can help with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Eva.\u201d She took a deep, shaky breath, her composure slipping. \u201cI appreciate you.\u201d</p><p>We hung up. I called Gideon\u2019s office, and his secretary answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Scott. It\u2019s Eva. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d I could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>My feet tapped restlessly. I couldn\u2019t help but be worried about my friend. \u201cCould you ask Gideon to give me a call when he has a free minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put you through now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay, great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>A moment later I heard the voice I loved. \u201cWhat do you need, Eva?\u201d</p><p>I was startled for a minute by his brusqueness. \u201cAre you busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a meeting.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. \u201cMy bad. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva\u2014\u201d</p><p>I hung up, and then called Scott again to discuss how we should handle calls in the future so I didn\u2019t come out looking like an ass. Before he answered, the secondary line flashed with an incoming call. I switched over. \u201cMark Garrity\u2019s office\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever hang up on me,\u201d Gideon snapped.</p><p>I bristled at his tone. \u201cAre you in a meeting or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. Now I\u2019m dealing with you.\u201d</p><p>Hell if anyone was going to \u201cdeal\u201d with me. I could be as pissy as him any day of the week. \u201cYou know, I asked Scott to give you a message when you had time for it and he patched me through. He shouldn\u2019t have done that, if you were busy with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has standing orders to always connect your calls. If you want to leave me a message, send a text or an e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, excuse me for not knowing the etiquette for getting in touch with you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind that now. Say what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t play games with me, angel.\u201d</p><p>I was reminded of the last time I\u2019d called him at work and how off he\u2019d sounded then, too. If something was bugging him, he sure wasn\u2019t sharing it.</p><p>I hunched over my desk and lowered my voice. \u201cGideon, your attitude pisses me off. I don\u2019t want to deal with you when you\u2019re aggravated. If you\u2019re too busy to talk to me, you shouldn\u2019t have standing orders that interrupt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to be unreachable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? \u2019Cause you seem that way right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Hearing his exasperation gave me a surge of satisfaction. \u201cI didn\u2019t text you because I didn\u2019t want to bother you in a meeting. I didn\u2019t send an e-mail, because it\u2019s a time-sensitive favor and I don\u2019t know how often you get to your inbox. I figured a message with Scott would get the job done best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you have my complete attention. Tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get off the phone, and I want you to get back to your meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to get,\u201d he said, with dangerous evenness, \u201cis me at your desk if you don\u2019t cut the shit and explain why you called.\u201d</p><p>I glared at his photo. \u201cYou make me want to find a job in New Jersey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me crazy.\u201d He growled softly. \u201cI can\u2019t function when we\u2019re fighting, you know that. Just say what you need, Eva, and forgive me for now. We can argue and have makeup sex later.\u201d</p><p>The tension left me. How could I stay mad at him after he admitted how vulnerable I could make him?</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI hate when you get reasonable after irritating me.\u201d</p><p>He made a low sound of reluctant amusement. I instantly felt better.</p><p>\u201cAngel mine.\u201d His voice took on the sexy, raspy warmth I needed to hear. \u201cDefinitely not a quiet, comfortable ornament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re perfect. Tell me why you called.\u201d</p><p>I knew that tone. I\u2019d turned him on somehow. \u201cYou\u2019re a maniac. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Lucky me.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, ace, I wanted to see if I could borrow one of your conference rooms for lunch with Megumi. She\u2019s back, but she\u2019s a mess and I think she wants to talk about it but there\u2019s really not a good place to go nearby that\u2019s private and quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse my office. I\u2019ll have something ordered in and you\u2019ll have the space to yourself while I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. However, I have to remind you that when you work for Cross Industries you\u2019ll have your own office to lunch in.\u201d</p><p>My head fell back. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE research involved in prepping for the PhazeOne RFP kept me hopping, but I was antsy for information from Megumi, so the hour seemed to drag anyway.</p><p>I met up with her at the reception desk at noon. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too weird,\u201d I said, as she pulled her purse out of a drawer, \u201cwe\u2019re going to use Gideon\u2019s office for lunch. He\u2019s out and it\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh man.\u201d She shot me an apologetic look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eva. I should\u2019ve congratulated you. Will told me about your engagement, but I spaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally okay. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and squeezed my hand. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>My concern deepened. Megumi always followed the latest gossip. The friend I knew would\u2019ve heard about the engagement almost before I did.</p><p>We took an elevator to the top floor. The Cross Industries vestibule was as striking as Gideon himself. It was much bigger than others in the building and decorated with lilies and ferns in hanging baskets. CROSS INDUSTRIES was etched into the smoked-glass security doors in a masculine but elegant font.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Megumi murmured, as we waited for the receptionist to buzz us through.</p><p>The redhead I was used to seeing at the reception desk must have been out to lunch, because a guy with dark hair let us in.</p><p>He stood when we approached. \u201cGood afternoon, Miss Tramell. Scott said you should just go right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Mr. Cross left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just took over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Thank you.\u201d I led Megumi back. We rounded the corner to reach Gideon\u2019s office just in time to see him stepping out.</p><p>Fierce pride and possession moved me. Pleasure, too, when his stride faltered just a bit when he saw me. We met each other halfway.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I greeted him.</p><p>He gave me a nod in return and held his hand out to Megumi. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been officially introduced. Gideon Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegumi Kaba.\u201d She gave him a firm shake. \u201cCongratulations to you and Eva.\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile touched his sexy mouth. \u201cI\u2019m a lucky man. Make yourselves comfortable. If you need anything, just call up to reception and Ron will see to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I told him. \u201cYou won\u2019t even know we had a raging party in there while you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>He smiled outright. \u201cGood. I have a meeting later. Shot glasses and streamers would be interesting to explain.\u201d</p><p>I expected him to head out. Instead, he cupped my face, tilted my head to the angle he wanted, and pressed his lips to mine in an unhurried, chaste kiss that left me with little stars in my eyes.</p><p>Then he whispered in my ear, \u201cLooking forward to making up later.\u201d</p><p>My toes curled.</p><p>Pulling back, he slid easily into the reserved persona he showed the rest of the world. \u201cEnjoy your lunch, ladies.\u201d</p><p>He walked away with the confident, innately sexual stride that turned heads.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still standing upright,\u201d Megumi murmured, shaking her head. \u201cKills me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t explain how weak Gideon made me. How shaken and needy I could so easily become. \u201cCome on,\u201d I said breathlessly. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>She followed me into Gideon\u2019s office. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>While she took in the sprawling space with its panoramic views and monochromatic color scheme, I went to the bar, where lunch awaited us. I remembered how I\u2019d felt the first time I walked into the room. Despite the multiple seating areas that might have invited guests to sit and stay awhile, the progressively contemporary, cutting-edge design kept visitors from getting too comfortable.</p><p>There were so many sides to the man I\u2019d married. His office reflected only one. The classically European style of his penthouse reflected another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you ever experimented with BDSM?\u201d Megumi asked, seizing my attention.</p><p>Surprise made me drop the napkin-rolled utensils I\u2019d been holding. I spun to face her and found her staring out the window at the city. \u201cThat acronym covers a lot of ground.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her wrist. \u201cBeing tied up and gagged. Helpless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been helpless, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Her head turned. Her eyes were twin shadows in her pale face. \u201cDid you like it? Did it turn you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I walked over to the nearest couch and sat. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t with the right person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he know that?\u201d</p> <p>The formerly appetizing smell of lunch started to turn my stomach. \u201cWhy are you asking me these questions, Megumi?\u201d</p><p>She answered by rolling up her sleeve, exposing a wrist so bruised it was nearly black.</p><p>7</p><p>IT WAS AFTER eight when I let myself into Eva\u2019s apartment and found her sitting with Cary on the living room\u2019s white sectional sofa, holding a glass of red wine in both hands.</p><p>My wife gravitated toward modern traditional furnishings, but I could see touches of her mother and roommate in the d\u00e9cor. I didn\u2019t resent those pieces of Monica and Cary, but I looked forward to the day when I shared a home with Eva that reflected us, undiluted.</p><p>Still, the apartment would always be a special place to me. I would never forget the way Eva had looked the first time I\u2019d come over. Naked beneath a thigh-length silk robe, her face made up for the night ahead, a diamond anklet winking at me. Teasing me.</p> <p>I had lost all rational thought. I\u2019d put my mouth on her, my hands all over her, and my fingers and tongue inside her. I hadn\u2019t even thought about getting her to the \u201cfuck pad.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have been able to wait, even if I had. She wasn\u2019t like any woman who\u2019d come before her. Not just because of who she was, but also because of who I was when I was with her.</p><p>It was unlikely I would ever allow the property management to lease the space out again. It held too many memories, both good and bad.</p><p>I tipped my chin at Cary in greeting and sat beside Eva. My wife\u2019s best friend was dressed to go out, while Eva wore a Cross Industries T-shirt and had her hair twisted up in a clip. They both glanced at me, and I knew something was wrong.</p><p>There were things to discuss, but whatever was troubling Eva was the pressing priority.</p><p>Cary stood. \u201cI\u2019m heading out. Call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy middle name, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>The front door shut behind him as Eva\u2019s head fell gently against my shoulder. Sliding my arm around her, I settled deeper into the sofa and tucked her closer. \u201cTalk to me, angel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Megumi.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s this guy she was into and things weren\u2019t working out\u2014he was hot-and-cold and couldn\u2019t commit\u2014so she broke it off. But afterward, he stepped it up and she let him come over. They started messing around with a little bondage, but things got out of hand in a bad way.\u201d</p><p>The mention of bondage put me on alert. I ran my hand down her back and tucked her tighter against me. I was nothing if not patient in aligning my desires with her fears. Setbacks were expected and accommodated, but I didn\u2019t want someone else\u2019s misadventures to create new hurdles for Eva and me to face.</p><p>\u201cSounds like bad judgment all around,\u201d I said. \u201cOne of them should\u2019ve known what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing.\u201d She pulled away and faced me. \u201cI went over it with Megumi. She said no\u2014a lot\u2014until he gagged her. He got off on her pain, Gideon. And now he\u2019s terrorizing her with texts and photos he took of her that night. She\u2019s asked him to stop, but he won\u2019t. He\u2019s sick. Something\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>I weighed how best to respond. I went with blunt. \u201cEva. She broke it off, and then took him back. He might not realize she\u2019s serious this time.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled, then slid off the couch in a rush of curvy, golden legs. \u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for him! She\u2019s bruised everywhere. It\u2019s been a week and the bruises are still dark. She couldn\u2019t sit down for days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not excusing him.\u201d I stood with her. \u201cI would never justify an abuser\u2014you know that. I don\u2019t have the whole story, but I know your story. Her situation isn\u2019t like yours. Nathan was an aberration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not projecting here, Gideon. I saw the pictures. I saw her wrists, her neck. I saw his texts. He\u2019s crossed a line. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven more reason for you to stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to her hips. \u201cOh my God. You did not just say that! She\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re my wife. I know that look on your face. There are some battles that aren\u2019t yours to fight. You will not confront this man the way you did my mother and Corinne. You will not put yourself in the middle of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say I was going to do that? No, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not an idiot. I asked Clancy to find him and talk to him.\u201d</p><p>I went still inside. Benjamin Clancy was her stepfather\u2019s man, not mine. Totally outside my control. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do instead? Nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreferably. At most, you should\u2019ve asked Ra\u00fal.\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cWhy would I do that? I don\u2019t know Ra\u00fal enough to ask him for a personal favor.\u201d</p><p>I checked my exasperation. \u201cWe discussed this. He works for you. You don\u2019t have to ask him for favors, you just need to tell him what you need done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRa\u00fal works for you. Besides, I\u2019m not some godfather sending out hired thugs to teach people lessons. I asked someone I trust, as a friend, to help another friend of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever you rationalize it, the result is the same. You forget, Ben Clancy is employed to protect your stepfather\u2019s interests. He looks after you only because it gives him more control in securing Stanton\u2019s safety and reputation.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cHow would you know what his motives are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, let\u2019s simplify. Focus on the fact that your mother and Stanton have been invading your privacy for some time. You\u2019re keeping that door open by using their resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Eva caught her lower lip in her teeth. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent a trained professional to \u2018talk\u2019 to this guy. But you didn\u2019t fully assess the possibility of blowback. If you\u2019d tapped Ra\u00fal to help you, he would\u2019ve known to be extra vigilant.\u201d My jaw clenched. \u201cDamn it, Eva. Don\u2019t make it hard for me to keep you safe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d She reached for me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, okay? I told you what was happening as soon as you walked in the door. And Clancy was with me until an hour ago, when he dropped me off after my Krav Maga class. Nothing\u2019s happened yet that would put me in danger.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her into me and held on, wishing I could be certain she was right. \u201cI want Ra\u00fal to escort you wherever you go,\u201d I said gruffly. \u201cTo your classes, the gym, shopping . . . whatever. You need to let me look after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do, baby,\u201d she said soothingly, her temper cooled. \u201cBut you can be obsessive about it.\u201d</p><p>I would always be obsessive when it came to her. I\u2019d come to accept that. Eventually, she would, too. \u201cThere are things I can\u2019t give you. Don\u2019t fight me on the things I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Her face softened. \u201cYou give me everything I need.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my fingers across her jaw. She was so soft. Delicate. I had never anticipated my sanity hinging on something so fragile. \u201cYou come home to another guy. You make your living by working for someone else. I\u2019m not as necessary to you as I\u2019d like to be.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes brightened with humor. \u201cWhile I\u2019m about as dependent on you as I can stand to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mutual.\u201d Running my hands down her arms, I caught her by the wrists and squeezed with just enough pressure to capture her focus. I watched her pupils dilate and her lips part, her body instinctively responding to the restraint. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll come to me first from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>The undercurrents of arousal and surrender in her voice sent my blood humming. She swayed into me, her body softening. \u201cI\u2019d like to come now, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, as always, at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>GIDEON.</p><p>The shock of hearing panic in Eva\u2019s voice reverberated through me. My body jolted, jerking me out of the deepest sleep. Rolling to my side with a low moan, I struggled awake, shoving my hair out of my face to find her kneeling on the edge of the bed.</p><p>A heavy, inescapable sense of dread had my heart racing and cold sweat coating my skin.</p><p>I pushed up onto one elbow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Moonlight slanted through the room and haloed her. She\u2019d come to me in our bedroom in the apartment next door to hers. Something had woken her, and I was afraid. Fear chilled me to the bone.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She slid into me in a rush of silken skin and shining hair. Curled against me, she reached up and touched my face. \u201cWhat were you dreaming about?\u201d</p><p>The stroke of her fingertips left a trail of wet across my skin. Startled, horrified, I scrubbed at my eyes and smeared more tears across my cheek. In a corner of my mind, I sensed the lingering shadow of a dream.</p><p>The brush of memory had me shivering, spiraling further downward.</p><p>I rolled into her and pulled her tight against me, hearing her gasp as I squeezed too hard. Her skin was cool to the touch, but her flesh was warm beneath and I absorbed her heat, breathed in her scent, felt the terrible lingering grief inside me ease with her nearness.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t grasp the dream I\u2019d had, but it refused to let go of me.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d she crooned, her fingers pushing through the sweat-damp roots of my hair, her hand stroking up and down my back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. I fought for air and a horrible sound ripped from my burning lungs.</p><p>A sob. Christ. Then another. I couldn\u2019t stop the violent contractions.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d She hugged me harder, her legs tangling with mine. She rocked us gently, whispering words I couldn\u2019t hear over the pounding of my heartbeat and the outcry of my phantom pain.</p><p>I wrapped myself around her, holding on to the love that could save me.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cGIDEON!\u201d</p><p>Eva\u2019s back arched as I thrust hard, my knees spreading her thighs wide, my cock tunneling deep. Her wrists were pinned by my hands, her head thrashing as I fucked her hard.</p><p>Some days I woke her with tenderness. Today wasn\u2019t one of those mornings.</p><p>I\u2019d woken to a throbbing erection, the head of my dick wet with pre-cum against the curve of Eva\u2019s ass. I aroused her hungrily, impatiently, sucking her nipples to hard points, slickening her cunt with the demanding drive of my fingers. She\u2019d ignited to my touch, gave herself over to me, gave herself to me.</p><p>God. I loved her so much.</p><p>The need to come was like a vise around my balls, the pressure exquisite. She was tight, so amazingly snug, and so wet. I couldn\u2019t get enough. Couldn\u2019t get deep enough, even when I felt the end of her clasping at the head of my cock.</p><p>She thrashed beneath my pounding drives, her heels sliding across the sheets, her tits rocking with the force of my thrusts. She was so small, so soft, and I was fucking her lush body with everything I had in me.</p><p>Take me. Take all of me. The good and the bad. Everything. Take it all.</p><p>The headboard banged into the shared wall between our two apartments in a hard-driving rhythm that screamed crazed sex to anyone listening. As did the growls spilling from my throat, the animalistic sounds of my pleasure I didn\u2019t try to hold back. I loved fucking my wife. Craved it. Needed it. And I didn\u2019t care who knew what she did to me.</p><p>Eva arched up, sinking her teeth into my biceps, her bite sliding over my sweat-slick skin. The mark of possession drove me wild, had me thrusting so hard I shoved her up the bed.</p><p>She cried out. I hissed as she tightened around me like a greedy fist.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d I bit out, my jaw clenched against the urge to do the same, to let go and pump every drop I had into her.</p><p>Rolling my hips, I ground against her clit, pleasure sizzling up my spine when she moaned my name and climaxed around me in pulsing ripples.</p><p>I kissed her roughly, drinking in her taste, spilling into her with a shuddering groan.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>EVA stumbled a little as I helped her out of the back of the Bentley in front of the Crossfire.</p><p>A hot flush spread across her face and she shot me a look. \u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose questioningly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shaky and you\u2019re not, sex machine.\u201d</p><p>I smiled innocently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Her wry smile faded as she glanced down the street. \u201cPaparazzi,\u201d she said grimly.</p><p>I followed her gaze and spotted the photographer aiming a camera out of the open passenger window of his car. Gripping her by the elbow, I led her into the building.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to start actually styling my hair every day,\u201d she muttered, \u201cyou\u2019re dealing with morning wood on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d I tugged her into my side and whispered, \u201cI\u2019d hire a full-time hairdresser for you before I gave up your cunt every morning.\u201d</p> <p>She elbowed me in the ribs. \u201cGod, you\u2019re crude, you know that? Some women take offense to that word.\u201d</p><p>She went ahead of me through the security turnstiles and joined the mass of bodies waiting for the next elevator car.</p><p>I stood close behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re not one of them. However, I might be willing to revise. I recall orifice being a favorite of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. Shut up,\u201d she said, laughing.</p><p>We separated when she exited on the twentieth floor and I went up to Cross Industries without her. I wouldn\u2019t be doing so for long. Someday, Eva would be working with me, helping to build our future as a team.</p> <p>I was debating the myriad avenues to achieving that goal when I rounded the corner on approach to my office. My stride slowed when I saw the willowy brunette waiting by Scott\u2019s desk.</p><p>I steeled myself to deal with my mother again.</p><p>Then her head turned and I saw it was Corinne.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She rose gracefully to her feet, her eyes brightening with a look I\u2019d come to recognize, having seen it on Eva\u2019s face.</p><p>It gave me no pleasure to see that warmth in Corinne\u2019s eyes. Unease slid down my spine, stiffening my back. The last time I had seen her had been shortly after she\u2019d tried to kill herself.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Corinne. How are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d She came toward me and I took a step back, causing her to slow and her smile to waver. \u201cDo you have a moment?\u201d</p><p>I gestured to my office.</p><p>With a deep breath, she turned and preceded me. I glanced at Scott. \u201cGive us ten.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his gaze sympathetic.</p><p>Corinne walked to my desk and I joined her, hitting the button that closed the door behind us. I kept the glass clear and didn\u2019t remove my jacket, sending her every signal that she shouldn\u2019t settle in for long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss, Corinne.\u201d Saying the words wasn\u2019t enough, but they were all I could give her. The memories of that night in the hospital would be with me for a while.</p><p>Her lips whitened. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. All these years of trying . . . I thought I couldn\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d She picked up the photo of Eva on my desk. \u201cJean-Fran\u00e7ois told me you called a couple times asking about me. I wish you\u2019d called me. Or returned my calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate, under the circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>She looked at me. Her eyes weren\u2019t the same shade of blue as my mother\u2019s, but they were close, and their sense of style was similar. Corinne\u2019s elegant blouse and trousers were notably like something I\u2019d once seen my mother wear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married,\u201d Corinne said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, but I answered anyway. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. \u201cI\u2019d hoped Eva was lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very protective when it comes to her. Tread lightly.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes, she set the picture down hard. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you one, but if you need to hear it, she\u2019s everything to me.\u201d</p><p>The tightness of her mouth softened with a quiver. \u201cWould it make a difference if I told you I\u2019m getting divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I exhaled roughly. \u201cYou and I will never be together again, Corinne. I don\u2019t know how many times or in how many ways I can say it. I could never be what you want me to be. You dodged a bullet when you broke our engagement.\u201d</p><p>She flinched, her hair sliding over her shoulder to flow down to her waist. \u201cIs that what\u2019s keeping us apart? You can\u2019t forgive me for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive you? I\u2019m thankful.\u201d My voice softened when tears filled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be cruel. I can guess how painful this might be. But I didn\u2019t want you to have hope when there isn\u2019t any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if Eva said these things to you?\u201d she challenged. \u201cWould you just give up and walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d I raked a hand through my hair, struggling to find the words. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I have with Eva. She needs me as much as I need her. For both our sakes, I wouldn\u2019t ever give up trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>Frustration made me curt. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. I played a role for you. I let you see only what I wanted you to see, what I thought you could accept.\u201d And in return, I saw only what I wanted to see in her, the girl she\u2019d once been. I had stopped paying real attention long ago, and so I\u2019d failed to see how she had changed. She\u2019d been a blind spot for me, but no longer.</p><p>She stared at me in shocked silence for a moment. \u201cElizabeth warned me that Eva was rewriting your past. I didn\u2019t believe her. I\u2019ve never known you to be swayed by anyone, but I guess there\u2019s a first time for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother believes what she wants and you\u2019re welcome to join her.\u201d They were similar in that way, too. Good at believing what they wanted and ignoring any proof to the contrary.</p><p>It was a revelation to realize I had been comfortable with Corinne because I\u2019d known she wouldn\u2019t pry. I\u2019d been able to fake normalcy with her and she never dug deeper. Eva had changed that for me. I wasn\u2019t normal and I didn\u2019t need to be. Eva accepted me the way I was.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to reveal my past to everyone, but my days of playing along with the lies were over.</p><p>Corinne reached a hand out to me. \u201cI love you, Gideon. You used to love me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was grateful to you,\u201d I corrected. \u201cAnd I will always be. I was attracted to you, had fun with you, for a time I even needed you, but it would never have worked out between us.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hand back to her side.</p><p>\u201cI would have found Eva eventually. And I would\u2019ve wanted her, given up everything to have her. I would have left you to be with her. The end was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Corinne turned away. \u201cWell . . . at least we\u2019ll always be friends.\u201d</p><p>It was an effort to strip any apology out of my tone. I wouldn\u2019t encourage her. \u201cThat won\u2019t be possible. This is the last time you and I will speak to each other.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shook with a ragged indrawn breath, and I turned my head, fighting with discomfort and regret. She\u2019d been important to me once. I would miss her, but not in the way she wanted me to.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to live for if I don\u2019t have you?\u201d</p><p>I turned at her question and barely caught her when she ran into me, holding her at bay with a grip on her upper arms.</p><p>The devastation on her beautiful face got to me before I could process what she\u2019d said. Then it registered. Horrified, I shoved her away. She stumbled back as her heels caught in the carpet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put that on me,\u201d I warned, my voice low and hard. \u201cI\u2019m not responsible for your happiness. I\u2019m not responsible for you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d she cried. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d I went to the door and yanked it open. \u201cGo home to your husband, Corinne. Take care of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d she hissed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this, and I might be too hurt to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Corinne.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a long minute and then stormed out of my office.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I pivoted, not knowing where to go or what to do, but I had to do something. Anything. I paced.</p><p>I\u2019d pulled out my smartphone and called Eva before I consciously made the decision to do so.</p><p>\u201cMark Garrity\u2019s office,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d The one word betrayed my relief at hearing her voice. She was what I needed. Something in me had known that.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She read me immediately, as she so often did. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>I glanced out at my staff in the distant cubicles getting into the groove of the day. I hit the controls to frost the glass, carving out a moment alone with my wife.</p><p>I lightened my tone, not wanting to cause her stress. \u201cI miss you already.\u201d</p><p>She waited a beat before replying, adjusting to my mood. \u201cLiar,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou\u2019re too busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. Now, tell me how much you\u2019re missing me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible. What am I going to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. So what\u2019s up? It\u2019s going to be a busy day and I have to get going.\u201d</p><p>I went to my desk and studied her photo. My shoulders relaxed. \u201cJust wanted you to know I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Don\u2019t stop. And FYI, it\u2019s nice to hear you not grumpy at work.\u201d</p><p>It was nice to hear her, period. I\u2019d given up trying to figure out why she affected me the way she did. I just appreciated that she could reset my day. \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadly. You rock my world, Mr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I stared into her laughing eyes, my fingertip brushing lightly over the glass. \u201cYou\u2019re the center of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE rest of the morning passed swiftly and uneventfully. I was wrapping up a meeting regarding a possible investment in a proposed resort chain when yet another personal interruption showed up. So much for workflow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to fuck up everything, don\u2019t you?\u201d my brother accused, barging into my office with Scott on his heels.</p><p>With a look, I gave Scott the okay to back out. He shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon to you, too, Christopher.\u201d</p><p>We shared blood but could not have been less alike. Like his father\u2019s, his hair was wavy and fell somewhere between brown and red. His eyes were a gray mixed with green, while I was most definitely our mother\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget that Vidal Records is Ireland\u2019s legacy, too?\u201d he snapped, his eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cI never forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you just don\u2019t give a shit. Your vendetta against Brett Kline is costing us money, damn you. You\u2019re hurting all of us, not just him.\u201d</p><p>Moving to my desk, I leaned against it and crossed my arms. I should\u2019ve seen it coming, considering how irate Christopher had become at the Times Square launch of the \u201cGolden\u201d video. He wanted Kline and Eva together. More than that, he wanted Eva and me apart.</p><p>It was the sad truth that I brought out the worst in my brother. The only times he ever acted cruelly or rashly was when he was trying to hurt me. I\u2019d seen him give brilliant speeches, charm people with his natural charisma, and impress board members with his industry savvy, but he never displayed those traits toward me.</p><p>Frustrated by his unprovoked animosity, I baited him. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to get to the point soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play innocent, Gideon. You knew exactly what you were doing when you systematically destroyed every media opportunity Vidal secured for Six-Ninths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf those opportunities were centered on Eva, they had no business being pursued to begin with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your decision to make.\u201d His mouth twisted in a scornful smile. \u201cDo you even comprehend the damage you\u2019ve done? Behind the Music has delayed their special because Sam Yimara no longer owns the rights to the footage he compiled of the band\u2019s early years. Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives can\u2019t include Pete\u2019s 69th Street Bar in their San Diego episode, because it\u2019s being demolished before they can film their segment. And Rolling Stone isn\u2019t interested in pursuing their proposed piece on \u2018Golden\u2019 since your engagement was announced. The song loses its interest without the happy ending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can get you the footage VH1 wants. Put them in touch with Arash and he\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you remove all traces of Eva? What\u2019s the point?\u201d</p><p>My brows lifted. \u201cThe point is supposed to be Six-Ninths, not my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not your wife yet,\u201d he shot back, \u201cand that\u2019s your problem. You\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to go back to Brett. You\u2019re not really her type and we all know it. You can eat her pussy at parties, but what she really likes is blowing rock stars in public\u2014\u201d</p><p>I was on him before he blinked. My fist hit his jaw; his head jerked back. I caught him with a follow-up left and he stumbled, crashing into the glass wall. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sylvia Day</p><p>Crossfire Series Book</p><p>Crossfire #1: Bared to You</p><p>Crossfire #2: Reflected in You</p> <p>Crossfire #3: Entwined with You</p><p>Crossfire #4: Captivated by You</p><p>Through it, I glimpsed Scott shoving to his feet, and then I braced for the impact of Christopher\u2019s body hurtling into mine. We went down. I rolled, punching his ribs until he groaned. He slammed his head into my temple.</p><p>The room spun.</p><p>Dazed, I rolled away and clambered to my feet.</p> <p>Christopher pulled himself up by the coffee table, blood running from the side of his lips and onto the carpet. His jaw was swelling and he gasped for air, dragging in harsh breaths. My fists ached and I flexed my hands, tensing with the need to hit him again. If he\u2019d been anyone else, I would have.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he taunted, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \u201cYou\u2019ve wanted me dead since the day I was born. Why stop now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>Two security guards rounded the corner at a run, but I held up a hand to stop them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking onto you, asshole,\u201d my brother growled, pushing heavily to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to members of the board. Explained what you\u2019re doing. You want to take me down, I\u2019m fighting you all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost it, you fucking idiot. Take your crazy somewhere else. And leave Eva alone. You want to make an enemy out of me, screwing around with her is the way to do it.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at me for a long minute, then laughed harshly. \u201cDoes she know what you\u2019re doing to Brett?\u201d</p><p>I winced through a deep breath, a dull ache in my side from a forming bruise. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything to Kline. I\u2019m protecting Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the band is just collateral damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter him than her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>Christopher stalked toward the door.</p><p>I should\u2019ve let him go but found myself speaking instead. \u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, Christopher, they\u2019re talented. They don\u2019t need a gimmick to be successful. If you weren\u2019t so damned eager to make me pay for something you\u2019ve imagined I\u2019ve done, you\u2019d be concentrating on better angles than making them into a one-hit wonder.\u201d</p> <p>He rounded on me with clenched fists. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me how to do my job. And don\u2019t get in my way or I\u2019ll shove you out.\u201d</p><p>I watched him leave, escorted by security. Then I went to my desk and checked my message log. Scott had noted that two of Vidal Records\u2019 board members had called over the course of the day.</p><p>I opened the line between Scott and me. \u201cGet me Arash Madani.\u201d</p><p>If Christopher wanted a war, I\u2019d give him one.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I arrived at Dr. Lyle Petersen\u2019s office on time at six o\u2019clock. The psychologist greeted me with a welcoming smile, his dark blue eyes warm and friendly.</p><p>After the day I\u2019d had, spending an hour with a shrink was the last thing I wanted to do. Spending an hour alone with Eva was what I needed more.</p><p>Our session began as they always did, with Dr. Petersen asking how my week had been and me answering as succinctly as possible. Then he said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the nightmares.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, laying my arm on the sofa\u2019s armrest. I\u2019d been up front about my sleep problems from the beginning in order to get the prescription medication that made me marginally safer for Eva to be near at night, but dissecting the dreams had never been one of the topics on discussion.</p><p>That meant someone else had brought them up. \u201cYou talked to Eva.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, since the answer was evident.</p><p>\u201cShe sent me an e-mail earlier,\u201d he confirmed, folding his hands atop his tablet screen.</p><p>My fingers drummed silently.</p><p>His gaze followed the movement. \u201cDoes it bother you that she contacted me?\u201d</p><p>I weighed my response before giving it. \u201cShe worries. If talking to you alleviates that, I won\u2019t complain. You\u2019re also her therapist, so she has a right to discuss it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t like it. You\u2019d prefer to choose which issues you share with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer Eva to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here. For her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does she hope the outcome of our sessions will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear your answer to that question.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, I gave it to him. \u201cEva previously made bad decisions. She learned to rely on the advice of therapists. It worked well for her and it\u2019s what she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to feel anything?\u201d I countered. \u201cShe asked me to try it out and I agreed. Relationships are about compromise, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Picking up his stylus, he tapped at the screen of his tablet. \u201cTell me about your previous experience with therapy.\u201d</p><p>I took a breath. Let it out. \u201cI was a child. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me over the rim of his glasses. \u201cHow did you feel about seeing someone? Angry, frightened, sad?\u201d</p><p>Glancing down at my wedding ring, I replied, \u201cA little of all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine you felt similarly about your father\u2019s suicide.\u201d</p><p>I stilled. Studying him, my gaze narrowed. \u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking, Gideon.\u201d He leaned back. \u201cI often feel like you\u2019re wondering what the angle is. I don\u2019t have an angle. I just want to help you.\u201d</p><p>I forced my posture to relax.</p><p>I wanted the nightmares to stop. I wanted to share the same bed as my wife. I needed Dr. Petersen to help me do that.</p><p>However, I didn\u2019t want to talk about things that couldn\u2019t be changed to get there.</p><p>8</p><p>\u201cHEY, GIRL. WHAT are your thoughts on karaoke?\u201d Shawna Ellison asked the second I answered the phone.</p><p>I dropped my pencil onto the notepad I\u2019d been scribbling in, then sat back on the couch and curled my legs onto the cushion. It was rolling past nine o\u2019clock and I hadn\u2019t heard from Gideon yet. I didn\u2019t know if that was a good or bad sign, considering he\u2019d had an appointment with Dr. Petersen earlier.</p><p>The sun had set nearly an hour before, and I\u2019d been trying not to think of my husband every five seconds since. Chatting with Shawna was a welcome distraction.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I hedged, \u201csince I\u2019m tone deaf, my thoughts on singing in public are pretty much nonexistent. Why?\u201d</p><p>In my head, I pictured the vibrant redhead who was quickly becoming a friend. In a lot of ways, she was like her brother Steven, who happened to be engaged to my boss. They were both fun and easygoing, quick to tease and yet rock solid, too. I liked the Ellison siblings a lot.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was thinking we could go to this new karaoke bar I heard about today at work,\u201d she explained. \u201cInstead of those cheesy background tracks, this place has a live band. You don\u2019t have to sing if you don\u2019t want to. A lot people go just to watch.\u201d</p><p>I reached for the tablet lying on the coffee table. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Starlight Lounge. I thought it might be fun for Friday.\u201d</p><p>My brows went up. Friday was our bringing-the-crew-together night. I tried to imagine Arnoldo or Arash singing karaoke and just the thought made me smile. Why the hell not? At the very least, it\u2019d break the ice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mention it to Gideon.\u201d I ran a search for the bar and pulled up its website. \u201cLooks nice.\u201d</p><p>The name had conjured thoughts of old-school crooner hangouts, but the images on the site were of a contemporary club decorated in shades of blue with chrome accents. It looked upscale and swank.</p><p>\u201cRight? I thought so, too. And it\u2019ll be entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wait \u2019til you see Cary with a mic. He\u2019s shameless.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and I grinned at the sound, which was as bubbly as champagne. \u201cSo is Steven. Let me know what you decide. Can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d</p><p>We hung up, and I tossed my phone onto the cushion beside me. I was leaning forward to get back to my project when I heard the ping of a text message.</p><p>It was from Brett. We need to talk. Call me.</p><p>I stared at his picture on the screen for a long minute. He\u2019d been calling all day but hanging up when he got my voice mail. I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t conflicted about him still reaching out, but it was a dead end. Maybe we\u2019d be friends someday, but not now. I wasn\u2019t up for it or the stress it caused Gideon.</p><p>I used to think facing issues that made me uncomfortable showed strength and responsibility. Now, I realized that sometimes resolution wasn\u2019t the purpose. Sometimes, you just had to take the opportunity to examine yourself better.</p><p>I\u2019ll give you a ring when I can, I typed back. Then I set the phone aside again. I\u2019d call him when Gideon was with me. No secrets and nothing to hide.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Cary strolled into the living room from the hallway dressed in pajama bottoms and a threadbare T-shirt. His dark brown hair was still damp from the shower he must have taken after Tatiana left an hour earlier.</p><p>I was glad she hadn\u2019t spent the night. I wanted to like the woman who said she was carrying my best friend\u2019s baby, but the leggy model didn\u2019t make it easy for me. I felt like she deliberately baited me whenever she could. I got the strong impression that she would like nothing more than to keep Cary all to herself and I was viewed as a big roadblock to that end.</p><p>My best friend sprawled facedown on the other section of the sofa, his head near my thigh and his long legs stretched out. \u201cWhatcha working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking lists. I want to get started on something for abuse survivors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>One of my shoulders lifted in a helpless shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t really know. I keep thinking about Megumi and how she didn\u2019t tell anyone. I didn\u2019t tell anyone, either. Neither did you, until way later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause who\u2019s going to give a shit?\u201d he said gruffly, propping his chin on his hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s scary to talk about it. There are a lot of hotlines and shelters for victims. I want to find something else that makes a difference, but I don\u2019t have any groundbreaking ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk to idea people.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cYou make it sound so easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, why reinvent the wheel? Find someone who\u2019s doing it right and help \u2019em out.\u201d He rolled onto his back and scrubbed at his face with both hands.</p><p>I knew that gesture and what it signified. Something was eating at him.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your day,\u201d I said. I\u2019d ended up spending more one-on-one time with Gideon in San Diego than I had with Cary, and I felt bad about that. Cary said he\u2019d had a good time hanging with his old crowd, but that hadn\u2019t been the purpose of our trip. I felt like I\u2019d let him down, even though he didn\u2019t accuse me of doing so.</p><p>He dropped his hands to his sides. \u201cI had a shoot this morning, and then I saw Trey for a late lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say anything to him about the baby?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI thought about it, but I couldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019m such a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be hard on yourself. It\u2019s a rough spot you\u2019re in.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s eyes closed, shuttering the vivid green of his irises. \u201cI was thinking the other day how much easier it\u2019d be if Trey swung both ways. Then we could both be banging Tat and each other, and I could have it all. Then I realized I didn\u2019t want to share Trey with Tat. Don\u2019t mind sharing her. But not him. Tell me that doesn\u2019t make me a total douche.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, I ruffled my fingers through his dark hair. \u201cIt makes you human.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been in a similar situation with Gideon, thinking I could work out a way to be friends with Brett, even while I was aggravated that Gideon was friends with Corinne. \u201cIn a perfect world, none of us would be selfish, but that\u2019s not the way it goes. We just do our best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always making excuses for me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I thought about that for a second. \u201cNo,\u201d I corrected gently, bending over to press a kiss to his forehead. \u201cI just forgive you. Someone has to, since you won\u2019t forgive yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>WEDNESDAY morning came and went in a flurry. Lunch was on me before I knew it.</p><p>\u201cWe were celebrating our engagement two weeks ago,\u201d Steven Ellison said, as I settled into the chair he held out for me. \u201cNow we get to celebrate yours.\u201d</p><p>I smiled; I couldn\u2019t help it. There was something infectiously joyful about my boss\u2019s fianc\u00e9, which you couldn\u2019t help but pick up on. \u201cMust be something in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be.\u201d He glanced at his partner, then back at me. \u201cMark\u2019s not losing you, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteven,\u201d Mark admonished, shaking his head. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d I answered, which earned me a surprised and pleased grin from my boss. His goatee-framed smile was as contagious as Steven\u2019s gregariousness. Really, our scheduled lunches were worth the price of admission. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to hear that,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Steven opened his menu with a decisive snap, as if something important had been decided. \u201cWe want you to stick around, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sticking,\u201d I assured them.</p><p>The server set a basket of olive oil\u2013drizzled garlic bread on the table between us, then rattled off the day\u2019s specials. The restaurant the guys had selected had two menus: Italian and Greek.</p> <p>Like most Manhattan eateries, the location was small and the tables packed tightly together, close enough that one party flowed into the next and you had to watch your elbows. The scents flowing out of the kitchen and wafting from the trays of passing servers had my stomach growling audibly. Thankfully the noise from the lunch crowd frenzy was loud enough to cover me.</p><p>Steven ran a hand through the bright red hair many women would kill for. \u201cI\u2019m having the moussaka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d I closed my menu.</p><p>\u201cPepperoni pizza for me,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>Steven and I teased him about being adventurous.</p> <p>\u201cHell,\u201d he shot back, \u201cmarrying Steven is adventure enough.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Steven set his elbow on the table and his chin on his fist. \u201cSo, Eva . . . how\u2019d Cross propose? I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t blurt it out in the middle of the street.\u201d</p><p>Mark, who was sitting on the bench seat next to his partner, gave him an exasperated look.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cHe broke the news to me on a private beach. I can\u2019t say he asked, because he pretty much just told me that we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>Mark\u2019s mouth twisted in thought, but Steven was blunt as always. \u201cRomance, Gideon Cross style.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cAbsolutely. He\u2019ll be the first to tell you he\u2019s not romantic, but he\u2019s wrong about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me see the ring.\u201d</p><p>I held my hand out to Steven and the Asscher cut diamond shot sparks of multihued fire. It was a beautiful ring, which held beautiful memories for Gideon. Elizabeth Vidal\u2019s thoughts on the subject couldn\u2019t touch that.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Mark, darlin\u2019, you have got to get me one of those.\u201d</p><p>The picture in my head of the flame-haired, burly contractor wearing a ring like mine was comical.</p><p>Mark shot him a look. \u201cSo you can shatter it on a job site? Let me get right on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiamonds are tough little beauties, but I\u2019ll take good care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait until I run an agency of my own,\u201d my boss retorted with a snort.</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d Steven winked at me. \u201cYou register anywhere yet?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah.\u201d He twisted to open the messenger bag next to him and pulled out his wedding binder. \u201cTell me what you think about these patterns.\u201d</p><p>Mark raised his gaze heavenward with a long-suffering sigh. I grabbed a piece of garlic bread and leaned forward with a happy hum.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I worked on the LanCorp RFP the remainder of the afternoon.</p><p>When my day ended, I headed to my Krav Maga class with Ra\u00fal. On the way, I reread Clancy\u2019s reply to my text saying I wouldn\u2019t need a ride from him. He had typed back that it was no problem, but I felt the need to explain further.</p><p>Gideon wants to have his ppl with me moving forward, so you\u2019re free from now on. TY for all your help.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to answer. Anytime. Holler when you need me. BTW, your friend shouldn\u2019t have any more trouble.</p><p>The \u201cthank you\u201d I sent back didn\u2019t seem like enough. I made a note to send him something that would better express my gratitude.</p><p>Ra\u00fal parked outside the brick-faced converted warehouse that was Parker Smith\u2019s Krav Maga studio and then escorted me inside, taking a seat on the bleachers. His presence threw me off a little bit. Clancy had always waited outside. Having Ra\u00fal watching made me a little self-conscious.</p><p>The massive open space still managed to look crowded, thanks to all the clients on the mats and in one-on-ones with instructors. The noise was nearly deafening, a cacophony of bodies hitting padding, flesh colliding with flesh, and the various shouts as participants psyched themselves up while psyching each other out. Giant metal delivery-bay doors added to both the industrial feel of the studio and the heat, which even the air-conditioning and multiple standing fans couldn\u2019t quite alleviate.</p><p>I was stretching in preparation for the grueling drills ahead when a pair of lanky legs came into my line of sight. I straightened and faced NYPD detective Shelley Graves.</p><p>She wore her curly brown hair in a bun as severe as her face, and her blue eyes assessed me with sharp impassiveness. I was afraid of her and what she could do to Gideon, but I admired her a lot, too. She was fierce and confident in a way I could only aspire to.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d she greeted me.</p><p>\u201cDetective Graves.\u201d She was dressed for work in dark slacks and a red jersey top. She wore a black blazer that didn\u2019t hide either her badge or her firearm. Her boots were scuffed and no-nonsense, much like her attitude.</p><p>\u201cSpotted you on my way out. Heard about your engagement. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flipped a little. Part of Gideon\u2019s alibi\u2014if one could call it that\u2014was that we\u2019d been broken up when Nathan was killed. Why would a powerful, upstanding public figure kill a guy over an ex he\u2019d left behind without looking back?</p><p>Getting engaged so quickly had to look suspicious. Graves had told me she and her partner had moved on to other cases, but I understood what kind of cop she was. Shelley Graves believed in justice. She believed Nathan had gotten his, but I knew something inside her questioned whether Gideon had something to pay for, too.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied, pulling my shoulders back. In this, Gideon and I were a team. \u201cI\u2019m a lucky girl.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the bleachers. At Ra\u00fal. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben Clancy?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious. You know, one of the feds I talked to about Yedemsky also has the last name Clancy.\u201d Her gaze bored into me. \u201cYou think they\u2019re any relation?\u201d</p><p>The blood drained out of my head at the mention of the Russian mobster whose corpse had been sporting Nathan\u2019s bracelet. I swayed a little with a sudden rush of dizziness. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, as if she\u2019d expected as much. \u201cProbably not. Anyway, I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk away, her attention on Ra\u00fal. Then, she paused and faced me again. \u201cYou inviting me to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>I fought through the buzzing in my head to say, \u201cThe reception. We\u2019re keeping the wedding small, just family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d Something like a smile transformed her thin face. \u201cHe\u2019s full of surprises, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even begin to decipher what that meant. I was too busy trying to process everything else she\u2019d said. I didn\u2019t even realize I\u2019d chased after her until I had her elbow in my hand.</p><p>She stopped, her body taut in a way that told me to let go. Which I did. Immediately.</p><p>I stared at her for a beat, trying to pull my thoughts together. Clancy. Gideon. Nathan. What the hell did it mean? Where was she going with it?</p><p>Most of all, why did I feel as if she were helping me? Looking out for me. For Gideon.</p><p>What I ended up saying startled me. \u201cI\u2019m looking to support an organization that does good work for abuse survivors.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cWhy are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>She shot me a look. \u201cTry Crossroads,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about that one.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of my bedroom\u2019s sitting room when Gideon came home. He walked in wearing loose-legged jeans and a V-neck white T-shirt, the keys to my place spinning around his finger.</p><p>I stared. I couldn\u2019t help it. Would he always stop my heart? I hoped so.</p><p>The room was small and girly, decorated by my mother with antiques, such as the silly escritoire I was supposed to use as a desk. Gideon infused a drugging dose of testosterone into the space, making me feel soft and feminine and eager to be ravished.</p><p>\u201cHi, ace.\u201d The love and longing he inspired were exposed in those two words.</p><p>The keys were caught in his hand abruptly and he came to a stop, looking down at me much as he had that first day in the Crossfire lobby. His eyes took on the brooding fierceness I found wildly exciting.</p><p>For some reason I would probably never understand, he felt the same about me.</p><p>\u201cAngel mine.\u201d He dropped gracefully into a crouch, his hair sliding briefly along his cheekbones in a loving caress. \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d</p><p>His fingers rifled through the papers scattered on the floor around me. Before my research into his Crossroads Foundation distracted him, I caught his hand and squeezed it.</p><p>I blurted out what I knew, as abruptly as the info had been sprung on me. \u201cIt was Clancy, Gideon. Clancy and his brother in the FBI planted Nathan\u2019s bracelet on that mobster.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did? How?\u201d I smacked him on the shoulder. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something? I\u2019ve been worried sick.\u201d</p><p>Gideon settled on the floor in front of me, crossing his long legs in a pose mirroring mine. \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers yet. Angus and I have been narrowing it down. Whoever was responsible was either watching Nathan or me and following our movements, so we started there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr watching both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Who would do that? Who had a stake in it? In you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I searched his face. \u201cDetective Graves knows. The FBI. Clancy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe brought it up at Parker\u2019s studio tonight. Tossed it at me in passing just to see how I\u2019d take the news.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cEither she\u2019s fucking with you or she wants you to stop worrying. My bet is on the latter.\u201d</p><p>I almost asked why, but then I realized I\u2019d come to the same conclusion. The detective was tough as nails, but she had a heart. I had caught glimpses of it during the few times we\u2019d interacted with one another. And she was good at her job, obviously.</p><p>\u201cWe have to trust her, then?\u201d I asked, crawling over the brochures and paperwork to curl into his lap.</p><p>He pulled me into him, fitting me into the hard planes of his body as if I were meant to be there always. I felt that way when he held me. Safe. Treasured. Adored.</p><p>His lips touched my forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Clancy just to be sure, but he\u2019s no fool. He wouldn\u2019t leave anything to chance.\u201d</p><p>My hand tightened around a fistful of his T-shirt, hanging on to him with everything I had. \u201cDon\u2019t keep things like this from me, Gideon. Stop trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His grip on me tightened, too. \u201cMaybe I should have said something, but we have only a few hours alone every day and I want them to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon. You\u2019ve got to let me in.\u201d</p><p>His chest expanded beneath my cheek, his heart beating strong and sure. \u201cI\u2019m working on it, Eva.\u201d</p><p>That was all I could ask for.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE next morning I padded into the kitchen on bare feet to find Gideon pouring coffee. I could say the smell of java is what added a spring to my step, but it was the sight of my husband, freshly shaved and dressed with his vest hanging open, that did it. I loved seeing him a little undone.</p><p>He looked me over as I went to him, my heels rapping on the marble, his face impassive and his eyes warm. Did he get the same kick when he caught sight of me ready to tackle my day? I doubted it. I was convinced men just saw hot . . . or not.</p><p>Wrapping my fingers around his wrist, I led his hand around me and up the back of my skirt to cup the undercurve of my buttock.</p><p>A smile teased the corners of his lips. \u201cHello to you, too, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>He snapped the back of my garter against my thigh. I jumped at the sting and gasped as warmth spread outward from the spot.</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . you like that.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>My lower lip stuck out in a pout. \u201cIt hurt.\u201d</p><p>Gideon shifted to lean back against the counter and pulled me between his spread legs, both of his hands lightly gripping the back of my thighs. He nuzzled his nose against my temple and massaged the place that burned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, angel.\u201d</p><p>Then he snapped my garter on the other side.</p><p>I arched in surprise, my body aligning with his. He was hard. Again. A low moan escaped me. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s turning you on,\u201d he murmured in my ear.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts!\u201d I complained, even as I rubbed against him. He\u2019d woken me with soft kisses and provocative hands. I had thanked him in the shower with my mouth. Still, he could go again. I could, too. We were addicted to each other.</p><p>\u201cWant me to kiss it and make it better?\u201d His fingers slid between my thighs and found me warm and ready. He groaned. \u201cChrist. What you do to me, Eva. I\u2019ve got so much to do . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, he felt good. Smelled even better. My arms wrapped around his neck. \u201cWe have to go to work.\u201d</p><p>He yanked me up to my toes, grinding me against his erection. \u201cWe\u2019re playing with these garters later.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him. I put my open mouth over his and devoured him, my tongue touching his. Stroking it greedily. Sucking.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand fisted in my ponytail, holding me in place as he took over the kiss, fucking my mouth, drinking me in. In an instant, I was hot, my skin humid with perspiration.</p> <p>His lips were firm yet soft against my own, his grip angling me just the way he wanted, his teeth scraping gently across my lower lip. The taste of him, flavored delectably with a hint of rich black coffee, intoxicated me. Drunk on him, I clutched his hair in my hands, holding on, my toes flexing to push me closer. Always closer. But never close enough.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Cary\u2019s voice broke me out of the sensual spell Gideon had cast. \u201cDon\u2019t forget we eat in here.\u201d</p><p>I started to pull away from my husband, but he held me tight, allowing me only to break the kiss. My gaze met his. His eyes were sharply alert beneath heavy lids, his lips softened and damp.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Cary,\u201d he said, his attention shifting to my best friend as Cary joined us by the coffeemaker.</p><p>\u201cFor you two, maybe.\u201d Cary opened the cupboard that held the mugs and pulled one out. \u201cSadly, I\u2019m too tired to get turned on by the show. Not making me feel too optimistic about the rest of the day.\u201d</p> <p>He was dressed in skinny jeans and a navy T-shirt, his hair skillfully arranged in a trendy pompadour. I pitied the single Manhattanites who\u2019d see him out and about that day. He was such a striking man, both physically and in the false confidence he exuded.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a shoot today?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. Tat does, and she wants me there. She\u2019s got morning sickness and shit, so I\u2019m going to be around to help her out if she\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d</p><p>I reached out and rubbed his biceps in sympathy. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome, Cary. You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted wryly as he lifted his steaming cup to his mouth. \u201cWhat else can I do? I can\u2019t get sick for her, and she\u2019s got to work as long as she can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s hand stroked up and down my back, offering wordless support. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got the time, Cary, I\u2019d like you to be there for the appointment with the designer who\u2019s renovating our place on Fifth Avenue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been thinking about that.\u201d Cary cocked his hip into the counter. \u201cI haven\u2019t totally worked things out with Tat, but I figure we\u2019ll be shacking up together at some point. You guys aren\u2019t going to want a screaming baby next door. When you\u2019re ready for that, you\u2019ll have your own, not put up with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCary . . .\u201d My best friend rarely looked beyond the next fifteen minutes of his life. To hear him stepping up to the plate so solidly made me love him all the more.</p><p>\u201cBoth sections of the penthouse are fully soundproofed,\u201d Gideon said, his voice holding the firm note of command that reassured everyone who heard it. \u201cWe can make anything work, Cary. You just tell me what concerns you have and we\u2019ll address them.\u201d</p><p>Cary looked into his mug, his beautiful face suddenly looking worn and tired. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll talk to Tat about it. It\u2019s hard, you know? She doesn\u2019t want to think about what\u2019s next and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. There\u2019s going to be this person who\u2019s totally dependent on us, and we need to be prepared for that. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back and Gideon let me go. It was hard to watch Cary struggling. It was scary, too. He didn\u2019t handle challenges well and I was so afraid he\u2019d slip back into familiar, self-destructive coping mechanisms. It was a threat we both faced on a daily basis. I had a group of people who kept me anchored. Cary had only me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what families are for, Cary.\u201d I offered a smile. \u201cTo drive each other crazy and straight into therapy.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted, then hid his face behind his mug. The lack of a glib reply made me even more anxious. A heavy silence descended.</p><p>Gideon and I both gave him a minute, taking the time to grab our own cups of java and caffeinate ourselves. We didn\u2019t speak or even look at each other, not wanting to create a unit that left Cary out, but I felt how in sync we were. It meant so much to me. I\u2019d never had someone in my life who was a true partner, a lover who was there for more than just a good time.</p><p>Gideon was a miracle in so many ways.</p><p>It struck me then that I had to make some adjustments, compromise a little more on the issue of working with Gideon. I had to stop thinking of Team Cross as being his alone. I had to own it, too, so I could share in it with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got time next week,\u201d Cary said finally, looking at me, then Gideon.</p><p>Gideon nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s plan on Wednesday, then. Give us some room to recover from the weekend.\u201d</p><p>Cary\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cSo it\u2019s that kind of party.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. \u201cIs there any other kind?\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cHOW are you?\u201d I asked Megumi when we sat down for lunch on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>She looked better than she had on Monday, but she was still overdressed for the heat of the summer. Because of that, I\u2019d ordered salads for delivery and we settled in the break room instead of braving the steamy day outside.</p><p>She managed a wan smile. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Lacey know what happened?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how close Megumi was to her roommate, but I hadn\u2019t forgotten that Lacey had dated Michael first.</p><p>\u201cNot all of it.\u201d Megumi pushed at her salad with a plastic fork. \u201cI feel so stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always quick to blame ourselves, but no means no. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, but still . . .\u201d</p><p>I knew just how she felt. \u201cHave you thought about talking to someone?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me, tucking her hair behind her ear. \u201cLike a counselor or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. How do you even start looking for someone like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got mental health benefits. Call the number on the back of your insurance card. They\u2019ll give you a list of providers to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just . . . pick one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d And if I got my act together, I\u2019d find a way to help more women like her and me. Something good had to come of our experiences. I had the motivation and the means. I just had to find the way.</p><p>Her eyes glistened. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Eva. Thanks for being here.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and hugged her.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t texted me lately,\u201d she said when I pulled back. \u201cI keep dreading that he\u2019s going to, but every hour that goes by that he doesn\u2019t, I feel better.\u201d</p><p>Settling back in my seat, I sent a silent thank-you to Clancy. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>AT five o\u2019clock, I left work and took the elevator up to Cross Industries, hoping to catch some time with Gideon before our appointment with Dr. Petersen.</p><p>I\u2019d been thinking about him all day, about the future I wanted us to have together. I wanted him to respect my individuality and my personal boundaries, but I also wanted him to open up some of his own. I wanted more moments like this morning with Cary, when Gideon and I stood together, facing a situation as one. I couldn\u2019t really push for that if I wasn\u2019t willing to make the same effort.</p><p>The redheaded receptionist at Cross Industries buzzed me in. She greeted me with a hard smile that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d I replied, breezing past her. It would be nice if all of Gideon\u2019s employees could be as easy-natured as Scott, but the receptionist had an issue with me and I\u2019d just come to accept it.</p><p>I headed back to Gideon\u2019s office and found Scott\u2019s desk empty. Through the glass, I saw my husband at work, presiding over a meeting with casual authority. He stood in front of his desk, leaning back against it with one ankle crossed over the other. He wore his jacket and faced an audience composed of two suit-clad gentlemen and one woman wearing a great pair of Louboutins. Scott sat off to the side, taking notes on a tablet.</p><p>Settling into one of the chairs by Scott\u2019s desk, I watched Gideon as raptly as the others in the room with him. It never ceased to amaze me how self-assured he was for a man who was only twenty-eight. The men he was meeting with looked to be twice his age, and yet their body language and focused attention told me they respected my husband and what he was saying.</p><p>Yes, money talked\u2014loudly\u2014and Gideon had tons of it. But he conveyed command and control with subtle actions. I recognized that after living with Nathan\u2019s father, my mom\u2019s first husband, who\u2019d wielded power like a blunt instrument.</p><p>Gideon knew how to own a room without thumping his chest. I doubted the setting made any difference; he would be a formidable presence in anyone\u2019s office.</p><p>His head turned and his gaze met mine. There was no surprise in those brilliantly blue eyes of his. He\u2019d known I was there, had sensed me just as I often sensed his approach without looking. We were connected somehow, on a level I couldn\u2019t explain. There were times when he wasn\u2019t with me and I just wished he was, but I still felt him nearby.</p><p>I smiled, then dug in my bag for my phone. I didn\u2019t want Gideon to feel like I was just sitting around waiting, not that doing so would pressure him at all.</p><p>There were dozens of e-mail messages from my mother with photo attachments of dresses and flowers and wedding venues, reminding me that I needed to talk with her about Dad paying for the ceremony. I\u2019d been putting off that conversation all week, trying to steel myself for her reaction. There was also another text from Brett, telling me that we needed to talk . . . urgently.</p><p>Standing, I looked around for a quiet corner where I could make that call. What I saw was Christopher Vidal Sr. rounding the corner.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s stepfather was dressed in the khakis and loafers I\u2019d come to expect, with a pale blue dress shirt open at the collar and rolled up at the sleeves. The dark copper waves he\u2019d passed on to Christopher Jr. were neatly cut around his neck and ears, and his slate green eyes were capped with a frown behind old-school brass-framed glasses.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d Chris slowed as he neared me. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, looking over my shoulder at Gideon\u2019s office. \u201cCan\u2019t complain. Do you have a minute? I\u2019d like to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The door opened behind me and I turned to see Scott stepping out.</p><p>\u201cMr. Vidal,\u201d he said, coming toward us. \u201cMiss Tramell. Mr. Cross will be another fifteen minutes or so. Can I get either of you something to drink while you wait?\u201d</p><p>Chris shook his head. \u201cNothing for me, thank you. But if you have a private room we could use, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Scott looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks,\u201d I answered.</p><p>Leaving his tablet on his desk, Scott led us to a conference room with a sweeping view of the city. A long, polished wood table gleamed beneath the recessed lighting, with a matching cabinet covering one wall and a large monitor lining the other.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything,\u201d he began, \u201cjust dial one and we\u2019ll take care of it. There\u2019s coffee in the cabinet there, and water.\u201d</p><p>Chris nodded. \u201cThank you, Scott. Appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Scott left. Chris gestured for me to sit, then took the chair to the right of mine, spinning it to face me.</p><p>\u201cFirst, let me congratulate you on your engagement.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIreland speaks very highly of you, and I know you\u2019ve been instrumental in bringing her and Gideon closer together. I can\u2019t thank you enough for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do much, but I appreciate the thought.\u201d</p><p>He reached for my left hand, which was resting on the table. His thumb rubbed gently over my engagement ring and his mouth curved ruefully.</p><p>Was he thinking about the fact that Geoffrey Cross had selected the ring for Elizabeth?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful ring,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m sure it meant a great deal to Gideon to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say to that. It meant a lot to my husband because it was a symbol of the love between his parents.</p><p>Chris released my hand. \u201cElizabeth is taking this very hard. I\u2019m sure there are a lot of complicated emotions a mother must feel when her first child decides to get married, especially with a son. My mother used to say that a son is a son until he gets married\u2014then he\u2019s a husband\u2014but a daughter is a daughter for life.\u201d</p><p>The conciliatory explanation rubbed me the wrong way. He was trying to be kind, but I was tired of all the excuses, especially when it came to Elizabeth Vidal. The pretending had to end or Gideon would never stop hurting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I needed the pain to stop. Every time he woke up crying, it shattered me a little more. I could only imagine the damage it was doing to him.</p><p>Still, I debated letting it go for now. I could argue and push forever, but Gideon needed to be the one to demand the answers and hear them given.</p><p>Put it away. When the time is right, it\u2019ll happen.</p><p>But I found myself leaning forward instead, unable to hold the silence Gideon had kept for too long.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d I insisted quietly. \u201cYour wife didn\u2019t have this reaction when Gideon became engaged to Corinne.\u201d I didn\u2019t know that for sure, but having seen Elizabeth with Corinne\u2019s parents at the hospital, it seemed likely.</p><p>His sheepish smile proved me right. \u201cI think that was different because Gideon had been with Corinne awhile and we knew her. You and Gideon haven\u2019t been together long, so there\u2019s still some adjusting to do. I don\u2019t want you to take it personally, Eva.\u201d</p><p>The smile chafed, but it was the words that were too much for me. Resentment welled and flowed over the wall I tried to contain it behind.</p><p>Chris wasn\u2019t blameless, either. Taking a grieving, troubled boy into his home had to have been hard\u2014especially when he\u2019d been building his own family with Christopher Jr. and Ireland on the way. But he\u2019d accepted the role of stepfather when he married Elizabeth. He shared responsibility for pursuing justice for a wounded and exploited child. Hell, a stranger would have an obligation to report the crime.</p><p>Leaning forward, I let him see how angry I was. \u201cIt\u2019s very personal, Mr. Vidal. Elizabeth is feeling threatened because I\u2019m not going to put up with this bullshit anymore. You both owe Gideon an apology and she needs to admit to the abuse. I\u2019m going to keep pressuring her to make things right. You can count on that.\u201d</p> <p>His posture stiffened visibly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>I snorted with disgust. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth would never abuse her children,\u201d he said tightly when I didn\u2019t reply. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful, devoted mother.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, then stared at him. Was he as delusional as Elizabeth? How could they both act like they didn\u2019t know?</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better explain yourself, Eva. Fast.\u201d</p><p>I sagged back into the chair, stunned. If he was acting, he deserved a goddamned Academy Award.</p> <p>He surged forward without getting up, bristling and aggressive. \u201cStart talking. Now.\u201d</p><p>My voice came quiet. Small. \u201cHe was raped. By the therapist he was seeing.\u201d</p><p>Chris froze. For a long minute, he didn\u2019t even breathe.</p><p>\u201cHe told Elizabeth, but she didn\u2019t believe him. She knows he was telling the truth, but she\u2019s denied it for whatever screwed-up reason she\u2019s come up with.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, shaking his head vehemently. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The one-word rebuff pushed me to my feet. \u201cAre you going to deny it, too? Who would lie about something like that? Do you have any idea how hard it was for him to admit to what was happening? How confused he must have been that a man he trusted would do those things to him?\u201d</p><p>Chris looked up at me. \u201cElizabeth would never ignore . . . something like that. There\u2019s a misunderstanding. You\u2019re confused.\u201d</p><p>I took in his dilated pupils and white-rimmed lips but refused to feel bad for him. \u201cShe went through the motions. That\u2019s all. When push came to shove, she chose to side with everyone but her own child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the handle of my bag and slung it over my shoulder. I bent into him, meeting him at eye level. \u201cGideon was raped. One of these days, you and your wife are going to look him in the eye like I\u2019m looking at you and you\u2019re going to admit it. And you\u2019re going to apologize for all the years he\u2019s lived with that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s voice cracked through the air, making me jump. Straightening in a rush, I stumbled as I faced him.</p><p>He stood in the open doorway, his hand gripping the handle with such force it should\u2019ve broken off. His face was hard, his body stiff, his gaze searing me with a different kind of heat.</p><p>Fury. I\u2019d never seen him so angry.</p><p>Chris pushed heavily to his feet. \u201cGideon. What\u2019s going on? What is she saying?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s arm shot out and grabbed me. He yanked me into the hallway with such force I yelped in alarm. I felt the bite of his fingers even after he released me.</p><p>With his hand at the small of my back, he propelled me forward, his stride so long and quick I had to scramble to keep pace.</p><p>\u201cGideon, wait,\u201d I said breathlessly, my heart pounding. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a fucking word,\u201d he snapped, pushing me roughly through the etched glass security doors into the elevator vestibule.</p><p>I heard Chris calling Gideon\u2019s name. I caught sight of him rushing toward us just before the elevator doors shut him out.</p><p>9</p><p>AS I LED Eva out of the Crossfire, Angus took one look at my face and his smile disappeared. He opened the rear door to the Bentley and stepped aside, watching me urge my wife into the backseat.</p><p>Our gazes met over her head as she slid into the back. I read the message in his faded blue eyes. Be gentle with her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how hard it was for me to show as much restraint as I was managing. I could feel the vein pulsating in my temple, echoing the driving pulse beat that had my cock throbbing.</p><p>I\u2019d nearly stopped the elevator halfway down to fuck Eva against the wall like an animal. The only things that deterred me were the security cameras and watchful guard eyes monitoring the feed.</p><p>I wanted to leash her. Sink my teeth into her shoulder as I nailed her. Dominate her. She was a tigress, clawing and hissing at everyone she felt had done me wrong, and I needed to pin her down. Make her submit.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d I bit out, rounding the back of the car to get in on the other side. Eva was a wild card. I couldn\u2019t control her.</p><p>I folded into the seat and slammed the door shut, staring out the window because I was afraid of what I\u2019d do if I looked at her. She was the air I breathed and at the moment, I couldn\u2019t catch my breath.</p><p>She set her hand on my thigh. \u201cGideon . . .\u201d</p><p>Grabbing that slender hand wearing my ring, I shoved it between my legs and thrust my aching dick into her palm. \u201cOpen your mouth again and that\u2019s what I\u2019m putting in it.\u201d</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>Angus slid behind the wheel and started the car. I felt Eva\u2019s gaze on the side of my face. Her hand pulled away and I nearly groaned at the loss of her touch. Then she shifted, curling into my side. Her other hand slid back between my legs, cupping my cock possessively. Her lips pressed a kiss against my jaw.</p><p>My arm went around her back. I took a deep breath, inhaling her scent.</p><p>The Bentley pulled away from the curb and we melded into midtown traffic.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>IT wasn\u2019t until we pulled over in front of the office building where Dr. Petersen kept his office that I remembered our appointment. I\u2019d been counting the minutes until we got home and I could take Eva the way I needed to . . . fast . . . hard . . . furious.</p><p>She started sitting up when Angus got out of the car. I tightened my arm around her. \u201cNot today,\u201d I said tightly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, kissing my jaw again.</p><p>Angus opened the door. She pulled away, then got out of the car anyway. She spun through the revolving doors and left me staring after her.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Ducking down, Angus peered in at me. \u201cCouples therapy means the both of you.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him. \u201cStop enjoying this.\u201d</p><p>The smile in his eyes curved his lips into a broad grin. \u201cShe loves you, lad, whether you like it or naw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I like it,\u201d I muttered, glancing over my shoulder to check the traffic before opening my door and stepping out. I rounded the trunk. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a loose cannon.\u201d</p><p>Angus shut the door. A rare summer breeze ruffled the graying red hair that peeked out from beneath his chauffeur\u2019s hat. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll lead, sometimes you\u2019ll follow. Expect you\u2019ll grumble about the following part for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>I growled, exasperated. \u201cShe talked to Chris.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose with surprise even as he nodded. \u201cI saw him go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t she leave it the hell alone?\u201d I stepped onto the sidewalk, tugging my vest into place and wishing I could straighten my thoughts as easily. \u201cShe can\u2019t change the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the past she\u2019s thinking of.\u201d He set his hand briefly on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s the future.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I found Eva pacing in Dr. Petersen\u2019s office, her hands waving as she spoke. The good doctor sat in his customary chair, his attention on his tablet as he took notes.</p><p>\u201cThe whole situation makes me so mad,\u201d she seethed. Then she caught sight of me standing in the doorway and paused midstride.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d A brilliant smile lit up her beautiful face.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do to put that happy look on her. The fact that she smiled like that just because she saw me . . .</p><p>\u201cEva. Doctor.\u201d I took a seat on the sofa. How much had she told him?</p><p>Dr. Petersen followed me with his gaze. \u201cHello, Gideon. I\u2019m glad you could join us after all.\u201d</p><p>I patted the cushion next to me and waited for Eva to sit.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re making plans to move back into the penthouse on Fifth with Cary,\u201d I said smoothly once she\u2019d settled beside me, deflecting the conversation into territory I was more comfortable addressing. \u201cI expect it will be a rocky transition for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Eva gaped.</p><p>Dr. Petersen set his stylus down. \u201cEva was just telling me about a visit with your stepfather. I would like to hear more about that before we move on.\u201d</p><p>I linked my fingers with Eva\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not open for discussion.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me. I turned my head to meet her gaze and my breath left me in a pained rush.</p><p>The new look on her face made me ache for a different reason altogether.</p><p>The session had barely started and already it couldn\u2019t end soon enough for me.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I told Angus to take us home\u2014to the penthouse.</p><p>It was obvious Eva was lost in her own thoughts by the surprise she displayed when the valet opened the door for her. We were in the subterranean garage beneath the building.</p><p>She glanced at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain,\u201d I told her, as I took her elbow and led her to the elevator.</p><p>We rode up in silence. When the car doors opened into our private foyer, I felt her tense beneath my hand. We hadn\u2019t been to the penthouse together in nearly a month. The last time we\u2019d been in the foyer had been the night she confronted me about Nathan\u2019s death.</p><p>I\u2019d been afraid then, too. Terrified I had done something she couldn\u2019t forgive me for.</p><p>We\u2019d had many explosive moments here. The penthouse hadn\u2019t seen as much joy and love between us as the secret apartment on the Upper West Side. But we would change that. One day, we would look back and this place would remind us of all the steps in our journey together, good and bad. I refused to envision anything else.</p><p>I opened the door, gesturing her in before me. She dropped her purse into an armchair and kicked off her shoes. I shrugged out of my jacket, hung it on the back of one of the bar stools in the kitchen, and then pulled a shiraz off the wine rack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disappointed in me,\u201d I called out, uncorking the wine.</p><p>Eva padded to the open archway and leaned against the tumbled stone. \u201cNo, not in you.\u201d</p><p>Retrieving a decanter and two glasses, I considered my reply. It was difficult bargaining with my wife. In every other deal, I went in with the knowledge that I could take it or leave it. There was no agreement anywhere I couldn\u2019t walk away from.</p><p>Except those that endangered my hold on Eva.</p><p>As I poured the wine from its bottle into the decanter, she joined me at the island.</p><p>Her hand came to rest on my shoulder. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been together long, Gideon, and you\u2019ve come so far already. I\u2019m not going to push you to go farther so soon. These things take time.\u201d</p><p>I let the decanted wine sit and turned to face her, pulling her close. She\u2019d felt so far away the last hour or so and the distance had been killing me.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Tilting her head back, Eva lifted her mouth to me. I pressed my lips to hers but otherwise did nothing else, wanting her to be the one to reach out. Needing her to be.</p><p>The stroke of her tongue over the seam of my lips made me groan. The feel of her fingers sliding into the hair at my nape soothed me. There was an apology in the softness of her lips gliding across mine and love in her quiet moan of surrender.</p><p>I caught her up, lifting her feet from the floor, so relieved she still wanted me that I felt dizzy with it. \u201cEva . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, baby, it\u2019s okay.\u201d She pulled back and touched my face, cupping it in both hands. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The back of my throat burned. I lifted her onto the counter, stepping between her spread legs. Her skirt rose up, baring the ends of her garters. I wanted her. In every way.</p><p>My forehead touched hers. \u201cYou\u2019re upset that I didn\u2019t want to talk about Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to avoid it so completely, that\u2019s all.\u201d She kissed my brow, her fingers brushing the hair from my face. \u201cI should\u2019ve considered the possibility, considering how angry you were when we left the Crossfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt Chris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the situation.\u201d I exhaled roughly. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting people to change and that doesn\u2019t happen. In the meantime, you\u2019re stirring up trouble at a time when we\u2019ve got enough on our plates. I just want to have some peace with you, Eva. Days when we\u2019re alone and happy and free of any bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd nights where you go to sleep in another bed? In another room?\u201d</p><p>My eyes squeezed shut. \u201cIs that what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot completely, but some of it, yeah. Gideon, I want to be with you. Waking and sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat peace you\u2019re looking for? You\u2019re pretending you have it during the day and suffering without it at night. It\u2019s tearing you up from the inside, and it\u2019s shredding me watching it happen to you. I don\u2019t want you to live like this forever. I don\u2019t want us to live forever like this.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, my soul bared to those amazing steel-colored eyes that didn\u2019t let me hide anything. There was so much love in the look she gave me. Love and worry, disappointment and hope. The pendant lamps over the island backlit her blond hair, reminding me of how precious she was. A gift I\u2019d never expected.</p><p>\u201cEva . . . I am talking to Dr. Petersen about the nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not about what\u2019s causing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming Hugh is the problem,\u201d I said evenly, feeling the burn of hatred and humiliation in my gut. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about my father instead.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled back. \u201cAce . . . I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s in your dreams, but I\u2019ve seen you wake up in two different ways: ready to beat up someone or crying like your heart is breaking. When you come out swinging, the things you say make me damn near certain you\u2019re fighting off Hugh.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a quick, deep breath. It infuriated me that my former therapist\u2014and molester\u2014could reach out from the grave and touch Eva through me.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d She wrapped her legs around my hips. \u201cI said I wasn\u2019t going to push you and I meant it. If we were two years into our relationship, I\u2019d put up a fuss, maybe. But it\u2019s only been a few months, Gideon. The fact that you\u2019re seeing someone and talking about your dad is enough for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But there are things we can never discuss that are haunting you, too. Dr. Petersen is already working with a handicap because of that. The more you keep from him, the less he can help.\u201d</p><p>Nathan. She didn\u2019t have to say the name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making an effort, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her hands smoothed over my shoulders, then reached for the buttons of my vest. \u201cJust tell me that you\u2019re not hoping to avoid talking about it forever. Tell me you\u2019re just working up to it.\u201d</p> <p>My heart rate sped up. I reached for her wrists, holding them firmly, anchoring myself to her. I felt cornered, trapped between her needs and my own, which seemed terribly divergent at that moment.</p><p>Her lips parted at the pressure of my grip, her breasts lifting with a quickened breath. A restraining touch, a heated look, the tone of my voice . . . Eva reacted to my unspoken demands as if she\u2019d been trained to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my best,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve got right now, Eva.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, her thoughts scattering as her body stirred. \u201cYou\u2019re playing with me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re manipulating me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m giving you the truth, even though it\u2019s not what you want to hear. You told me you wouldn\u2019t push. Did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>Wetting her lower lip with a brush of her tongue, she stared up at me. Then nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s have some wine and dinner. Afterward, if you\u2019d really like to play, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some silk cord I bought for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cSilk cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrimson, of course.\u201d I released her and stepped back, giving her some space to think while I reached for the decanter to pour her a glass. \u201cI\u2019d like to tie you down when you\u2019re ready for that. If not tonight, then someday. I won\u2019t push you, either.\u201d</p><p>We were both steering each other in directions that were uncomfortable. She chose to believe an educated observer was part of the answer we were looking for. I believed we could find a lot of the answers on our own, just the two of us connecting in the most intimate ways possible.</p><p>Sexual healing. What could be more perfect for two people who had the history Eva and I shared?</p><p>Eva accepted the wine I handed her. \u201cWhen did you buy that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week ago. Maybe two. I had no expectation of using it soon, but you made me want to today.\u201d I took a sip, letting the shiraz roll around my tongue. \u201cThat said, I\u2019m perfectly happy with just fucking you hard.\u201d</p><p>The wine sloshed a little in her glass as she lifted it to her mouth. She gulped it down, leaving a few drops in the bottom. \u201cBecause you\u2019re mad at me for talking to Chris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were furious when we left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuriously turned on.\u201d I smiled wryly. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why, because I don\u2019t understand it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>I reached up and brushed the pad of my thumb over her lips. \u201cI see you angry, passionate, ready to fight, and I want all that violence trapped beneath me. You make me want to hold you down, clawing and screaming, your cunt milking my cock as I pound it into you. Mine. All mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She set her glass aside and grabbed me, claiming my mouth with a wild hunger I hoped would never abate.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cHOW come you never told Chris about what happened with Hugh?\u201d</p><p>That unwelcome question came out of the fucking blue. I paused midchew, suddenly finding the bite of pizza in my mouth unappetizing. Dropping what was left of my slice onto the plate in front of me, I grabbed a napkin and wiped my mouth. \u201cWhy are we discussing this again?\u201d</p><p>Eva frowned at me from where she sat beside me on the floor in between the coffee table and the couch in the living room. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we? In any case, it doesn\u2019t matter. My mother told him.\u201d</p><p>Her frown deepened. She reached for the TV remote and lowered the volume, muting the voices of the NYPD detectives on the screen. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>I pushed to my feet and grabbed my plate. \u201cShe did, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that for sure?\u201d She followed me into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey discussed it at the dinner table one night, something I don\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe acted like he didn\u2019t know.\u201d She braced her hands against the counter as I dropped my leftovers into the trash. \u201cHe seemed genuinely confused and horrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s as conveniently obtuse as my mother. You shouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d I set the plate in the sink, the lingering smell of food making my stomach roil. \u201cWhat the fuck does it matter now? It\u2019s done, Eva. Done and over with. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was settled in for the night with my wife. Dinner, wine, a little TV, a couple hours making love . . . after a long, rough day.\u201d I left the kitchen. \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, wait.\u201d She grabbed my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t go to bed pissed. Please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I paused and removed her hand from my arm. \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cSTART out slow,\u201d he whispers, his lips near my ear.</p><p>I can feel him becoming excited. He reaches around my hip to where I\u2019m stroking my penis. His hand covers mine. His breath is quick and shallow. His erection brushes against my buttocks.</p><p>My stomach feels sick. I\u2019m sweating. I can\u2019t stay hard, even as my oiled fist slides up and down, guided by his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cConcentrate on how good it feels. Look at that woman in front of you. She wants you to fuck her. Imagine how it\u2019d feel to push your cock into her. Soft. Hot. Wet. And tight.\u201d His grip closes harder over mine. \u201cSo tight.\u201d</p><p>I look at the centerfold spread over the top of my toilet\u2019s water tank. She\u2019s got dark hair and blue eyes, and her legs are long. They always look like that, the women in the pictures Hugh brings.</p><p>He pants in my ear, and the sickness is back. Wrong. There\u2019s something wrong with me. This feels wrong. His eagerness makes me feel dirty. Bad. I\u2019m a bad boy, even Mom says so. She yells it at me when she\u2019s crying, when she\u2019s angry with me about Dad.</p><p>A low moan cuts through the sound of his heavy breaths. It\u2019s me making that noise. It feels good, even though I don\u2019t want it to.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to breathe, to think, to fight . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he coaxes. His other hand pushes between my buttocks.</p><p>I try to pull away, but he\u2019s got me trapped. He\u2019s bigger than me, stronger. No matter how I struggle, I can\u2019t push him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I tell him, squirming.</p><p>\u201cYou like it,\u201d he grunts. His hand pumps me harder. \u201cYou shoot off like a geyser every time. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s supposed to feel good. You\u2019ll be better once you\u2019ve come. You won\u2019t fight with your mother so much . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t! Oh, God . . .\u201d</p><p>He pushes two slick fingers inside me. I cry out, writhing away, but he won\u2019t quit. He\u2019s rubbing and thrusting into me, hitting the spot that makes me want to come more than anything. The pleasure grows despite the tears burning my eyes.</p><p>My head falls forward. My chin touches my heaving chest. It\u2019s coming. I can\u2019t stop it . . .</p><p>Abruptly, I look down from a higher vantage. My hand is suddenly bigger, my forearm thicker and coursing with veins. Dark hair dusts my arms and chest, my abdomen ripples with muscle as I fight the orgasm I don\u2019t want.</p><p>I am not a child anymore. He can\u2019t hurt me anymore.</p><p>There\u2019s a knife atop the centerfold, gleaming in the light from the vanity beside me. I grab it and jerk free of the fingers fucking me. I turn and the blade sinks into his chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d I roar, grabbing his shoulder and yanking him into the knife, all the way to the hilt.</p><p>Hugh\u2019s eyes widen with horror. His mouth falls open in a silent scream.</p><p>His face morphs into Nathan\u2019s. My childhood bathroom shimmers and transforms. We\u2019re in an eerily familiar hotel room.</p><p>My heart pounds harder. I can\u2019t be here. They can\u2019t find me here. Can\u2019t find any trace of me. I have to leave.</p><p>I stumble back. The knife withdraws in a smooth, blood-soaked glide. Nathan\u2019s eyes turn milky with death. They\u2019re gray. Gray eyes. Beautiful, beloved dove gray irises. Eva\u2019s eyes. Clouding over . . .</p><p>Eva is bleeding in front of me. Dying in front of me. I\u2019ve killed her. My God . . .</p><p>Angel!</p><p>Can\u2019t move. Can\u2019t reach her. She crumples and pools onto the floor, those stormy eyes dull and sightless\u2014</p><p>I jerked awake with a gasp, sitting up in a rush that sent an air-conditioned breeze across my sweat-soaked skin. I couldn\u2019t breathe through the panic and fear choking me. Shoving off the sheet tangled around my legs, I stumbled out of bed, blind with terror. My stomach heaved in protest and I lurched into the bathroom, barely reaching the toilet before I vomited.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I showered, washing away the sticky sweat covering me.</p><p>The grief and despair weren\u2019t so easy to get away from. As I scrubbed a dry towel over my skin, they weighed heavily, suffocating me. The memory of Eva\u2019s pale face etched with betrayal and death haunted me. I couldn\u2019t get it out of my head.</p><p>I stripped the bed with rough, jerky movements, then yanked a clean fitted sheet over the mattress.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>I straightened and turned at the sound of Eva\u2019s voice. She stood in the doorway to my bedroom, her hands twisting in the hem of the T-shirt she wore. Regret hit me hard. She\u2019d gone to sleep alone in the room I\u2019d had redesigned to look like her bedroom on the Upper West Side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said softly, tentatively, shifting on her feet in a way that told me how uncomfortable she felt. How wary. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>The light from the bathroom lit her face, revealing dark circles and reddened eyes. She\u2019d fallen asleep crying.</p><p>I\u2019d done this to her. I had made her feel unwelcome, unwanted, her thoughts and feelings less of a concern to me than my own. I\u2019d let my past drive a wedge between us.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t true. I had let my fear push her away.</p> <p>\u201cNo, angel, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She took a single step closer, then stopped herself.</p><p>Opening my arms, I said hoarsely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eva.\u201d</p><p>She came to me in a rush, her body lush and warm. I held her too tightly, but she didn\u2019t complain. Pressing my cheek to the top of her head, I breathed in her scent. I could face anything\u2014I would face anything\u2014as long as she stayed with me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d My voice was scarcely a whisper, but she heard it.</p> <p>Her fingers dug into the muscles of my back as she pulled me closer. \u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try harder,\u201d I promised. \u201cDon\u2019t give up on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She sighed, her breath soft against my chest. \u201cI love you so much. I just want you to be happy. I\u2019m sorry for pushing you after I said I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I fucked up. I\u2019m sorry, Eva. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. You don\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d</p><p>I picked her up and carried her to the bed, laying her down carefully. I crawled into her arms, wrapping myself around her and resting my face against her belly. She ran her fingers through my hair, massaging my scalp, then my nape, then my back. Accepting me, despite all my flaws.</p> <p>The cotton of her T-shirt grew wet with my tears and I curled in tighter, ashamed.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>GIDEON.</p><p>I stirred at the sound of Eva\u2019s voice, then at the feel of her hand sliding down my chest. Opening my tired, burning eyes, I saw her leaning over me, the room softly lit by the coming dawn, her hair aglow in the meager light.</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>She shifted, sliding a leg over me. Rising, she straddled me. \u201cLet\u2019s make today our best ever.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m on board with that plan.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile rocked my world. She reached for something she\u2019d left on her pillow and a moment later, haunting strains of music piped softly out of the speakers in the ceiling.</p><p>It took me a moment to recognize it. \u201cAve Maria.\u201d</p><p>She touched my face, her fingertips gliding over my brow. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to answer her, but my throat was too tight. I could only nod. How could I tell her it felt like a dream, a breathtaking heaven I didn\u2019t deserve?</p><p>She reached behind her to push the sheet below my hips and out of the way. Her arms crossed her torso to pull her shirt up and over her head. She threw it aside.</p><p>Awed, I struggled for my voice. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I said hoarsely.</p><p>My hands lifted, gliding over the plush curves and valleys of her voluptuous body. I sat up and dug my heels into the bed, pushing us backward until I was leaning against the headboard. My hands went into her hair and down her throat. I could touch her for days and not get my fill.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, tilting her head to take my mouth in a hot, demanding kiss.</p><p>I let her have me, opening to her. Eva licked deep, stroking me with her tongue, her lips soft and wet against mine.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you need,\u201d I murmured, lost to the gently muted music. Lost to her.</p><p>\u201cYou. Just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me, then,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cI hate to be the one to break it to you, Cross,\u201d Arash said, his fingers drumming on the armrest of the chair in front of my desk, \u201cbut you\u2019ve lost your killer instinct. Eva\u2019s tamed you.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up from my monitor. After spending two hours of my morning making love with my wife, I could concede that I wasn\u2019t feeling particularly aggressive. Slaked and relaxed was more apt. Still . . . \u201cJust because I don\u2019t think LanCorp\u2019s PhazeOne gaming system is a threat to the GenTen doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not paying attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware,\u201d he corrected, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t the same as paying attention, and I guarantee Ryan Landon has noticed. You used to do something every week or two to poke at him, which\u2014for better or worse\u2014gave him something to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it just last week that we closed the PosIT deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reactive, Cross. You need to make a move he didn\u2019t prompt.\u201d</p><p>My office phone started ringing on the line synced to my smartphone. Ireland\u2019s name popped up on the screen and I reached for the receiver. \u201cI have to take this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him as I answered. \u201cIreland, how are you?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like my sister to call. We usually texted back and forth, a form of communication we were both comfortable with. No awkward silences, no need to fake cheeriness or ease.</p><p>\u201cHey, sorry to call you in the middle of the day.\u201d Her voice was off.</p><p>I frowned, concerned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Ireland paused. \u201cMaybe now\u2019s not a good time.\u201d</p><p>I cursed inwardly. Eva had similar reactions when I was too brusque. The women in my life needed to cut me some slack. I had a big learning curve when it came to social interactions. \u201cYou sound upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cYou can call Eva and complain about it to her. She\u2019ll sympathize. Now, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cMom and Dad were fighting all night. I don\u2019t know what about, but Dad was yelling. He never yells, you know that. He\u2019s the most laid-back guy ever. Nothing gets to him. And Mom hates fighting. She\u2019s a conflict avoider.\u201d</p><p>Her astuteness both startled and impressed me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad took off early this morning and Mom\u2019s been crying ever since. Do you know what\u2019s going on? Is it about Eva and you getting married?\u201d</p><p>A strange but recognizable quiet settled over me. I didn\u2019t know what to say to her, and I refused to jump to conclusions. \u201cThat probably has something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>The only thing I knew for certain was that I didn\u2019t want Ireland listening to her parents fighting. I remembered what it had felt like when my parents fought in the days after my dad\u2019s financial fraud had been exposed. I could still feel echoes of the panic and fear. \u201cIs there a friend you can stay with over the weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>The suggestion was unnerving. \u201cYou want to stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ve never seen your place.\u201d</p><p>I stared at Arash, who was watching me. He leaned forward, setting his elbows on his knees.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to refuse, but I couldn\u2019t agree. The only person who\u2019d ever spent the night with me was Eva, and obviously, that hadn\u2019t turned out well.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d Damn it. \u201cEva and I have plans with friends tonight, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll need some time to change them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gotcha.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fuck up your plans. I\u2019ve got some friends I can call. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you. Eva and I can make some adjustments; it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a kid, Gideon,\u201d she said, clearly exasperated. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hang around your place knowing you and Eva were supposed to be out having fun. That would totally suck, so no thanks. I\u2019d rather chill with my own friends.\u201d</p><p>Relief relaxed my spine. \u201cHow about dinner on Saturday instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? I\u2019m down. Can I stay the night then?\u201d</p><p>I had no idea how I was going to manage it. I had to trust that Eva would know what to do. \u201cThat can be arranged. Will you be okay until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, listen to you.\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou sound like a big brother. I\u2019ll be fine. It was just weird, you know, hearing them going at it. It freaked me out. Most people are probably used to their parents fighting, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. All couples fight eventually.\u201d I said the words, but I was both uneasy and curious.</p><p>Eva couldn\u2019t have been right about Chris not knowing. I found that impossible to believe.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I\u2019D just finished rolling up the sleeves of my black dress shirt when Eva stepped into the reflection of the mirror. I froze, my gaze raking over her.</p><p>She had chosen short shorts, a sheer sleeveless blouse, and high-heeled sandals. She\u2019d pulled her hair up in its usual ponytail, but she had done something to it to make it look wild and bedhead messy. Her eye makeup was dark, her lips pale. Big gold hoops hung from her ears, and bangles decorated her wrists.</p><p>I\u2019d woken up to an angel. I would be going to bed with a different woman entirely.</p><p>I whistled in appreciation, turning my back to the mirror to take in the real deal. \u201cYou look like a bad, bad girl.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her ass and gave a cocky toss of her head. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019ve got the fuck-me look and we have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can be a little late. What would it take to talk you into wearing those shorts just for me?\u201d</p><p>I wanted others to want her and know she was mine. I also wanted to keep her all to myself.</p><p>Her eyes took on a calculating gleam. \u201cWe could renegotiate the hand job.\u201d</p><p>Remembering the deal we\u2019d struck\u2014a quickie for a clothed hand job\u2014I realized the shorts were going to make the former a bit more difficult than it could be. As for the latter, I could work something out.</p><p>Tilting my head in agreement, I told her, \u201cPut on a skirt, angel, and let\u2019s get this party started.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWAS this your idea?\u201d Arash asked, when we met him outside the ground-floor entrance to the Starlight Lounge.</p><p>Through the lobby glass, I watched a bouncer oversee the number of patrons entering the elevator that would take them to the rooftop. Two more bouncers stood guard at the exterior door, holding back the surging crowd hoping to get in based on their looks, their clothes, and/or their charm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as much of a surprise to me as it is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to tell you.\u201d Eva was literally hopping with excitement. \u201cShawna\u2019s heard good things about this place and I thought it\u2019d be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat reviews online,\u201d Shawna said, \u201cand some of my regulars were raving about it.\u201d</p><p>Manuel checked out the eager crowd behind the ropes, while Megumi Kaba stood cautiously between Cary and Eva. Mark Garrity, Steven Ellison, and Arnoldo all stood back, keeping the way clear for those whose names were on the VIP List.</p><p>Cary slung his arm around Megumi. \u201cStick with me, kid.\u201d He gave her a wide smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll show \u2019em how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Eva grabbed my arm. \u201cYour surprise is here.\u201d</p><p>I followed her gaze, spotting a couple approaching us. My brows rose when I recognized Magdalene Perez. Her hand was linked with that of the man next to her and her dark eyes were brighter than I\u2019d seen in a long time.</p><p>\u201cMaggie,\u201d I greeted her, clasping her extended hand and leaning down to kiss her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d</p><p>Gladder still that Eva had asked her. The two women had gotten off to a rocky start, which was entirely Maggie\u2019s fault. The rift between them had strained my relationship with Maggie in the weeks since, and I\u2019d been prepared to accept that as an indefinite state of affairs. It was nice, however, that I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Maggie grinned. \u201cGideon. Eva. This is my boyfriend, Gage Flynn.\u201d</p><p>I took the man\u2019s hand after he shook Eva\u2019s, noting the strength of his grip and the steady way he met my perusal. He gave me a once-over, too, but mine would be more thorough. Before the week was out, I would know everything worth knowing about the man. Maggie had been through enough with Christopher. I didn\u2019t want to see her hurt again.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s Will and Natalie,\u201d Eva said, as the last of our group arrived.</p><p>Will Granger had a retro beatnik look that worked for him. His arm was snug around the small blue-haired woman next to him, who dressed in the same fifties style and sported twin sleeves of tattoos.</p><p>While Eva made the introductions, I nodded at the bouncer to signal the arrival of the final members of our party. He held the line and cleared the doorway for us.</p><p>My wife shot me a suspicious glance. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you own this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hand slid down her back and rested lightly on the curve of her hip. She\u2019d ditched the shorts in favor of a fitted skirt with a split up the back. I almost wished she hadn\u2019t changed. The shorts had shown off her legs; the skirt showed off her amazing ass.</p><p>\u201cYou need to decide if you want me to answer the question or not,\u201d I said, as we made our way into the club. The music was loud, the amateur singer on the stage louder. Strategic lighting illuminated walkways and tables while still allowing the Manhattan nightscape to dazzle patrons. Air-conditioning pumped out of the walls and floors, cooling the open air to a comfortable temperature.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t own in New York?\u201d</p><p>Arash laughed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t own the D\u2019Argos Regal on Thirty-sixth anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Eva stopped walking, causing Arash to bump into her from behind and send her stumbling. I shot him a glare.</p><p>Grabbing my arm, Eva yelled over the volume of the crowded club. \u201cYou got rid of the hotel?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at her. The wonder and hope on her face more than made up for the financial hit I\u2019d taken. I nodded.</p><p>She threw herself at me, her arms twining around my neck. She peppered my jaw with quick, fierce kisses and I smiled, my gaze meeting Arash\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAnd suddenly,\u201d he said, \u201cit all makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>10</p><p>\u201cGOD, THOSE TWO are so sweet,\u201d Shawna said, watching Will and Natalie sing \u201cI Got You, Babe\u201d on the stage.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving me diabetes.\u201d Manuel stood with his drink. \u201cExcuse me, everyone. I see something interesting.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s voice near my ear was laced with amusement. \u201cSay good-bye, angel. We won\u2019t be seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>I followed his line of sight and saw a pretty brunette giving Manuel a blatant once-over.</p><p>\u201cBye, Manuel!\u201d I yelled after him, waving. Then I leaned into Gideon, who was semisprawled on the expensive leather upholstery. \u201cHow come all the guys you work with are hot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre they?\u201d he drawled, nuzzling my neck and along the curve of my ear. \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t be working with me much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I looked up at the starry sky. \u201cWhatever, caveman.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened around my hips, tugging me closer so that I was pressed fully against him from knee to shoulder. Joy spread through me. After all the crap we\u2019d been through the day before, it was so awesome to just enjoy each other.</p><p>Megumi leaned over the low coffee table that filled the center of the rectangular seating area we occupied. Bordered by two sectionals, the VIP section held our entire party comfortably. \u201cWhen are you getting up there to make fools of yourselves?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . never.\u201d</p><p>It had taken a few drinks and Cary\u2019s undivided attention to make Megumi comfortable enough to enjoy herself. My best friend had kicked things off with a rousing rendition of \u201cOnly the Good Die Young,\u201d and then he\u2019d dragged Megumi up there to sing \u201c(I\u2019ve Had) The Time of My Life.\u201d She\u2019d come back to the table glowing.</p><p>I owed Cary big-time for taking care of her. Even better, he seemed to have no intention of ditching us to cruise the place for conquests like Manuel had. I was really proud of him.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eva,\u201d Steven coaxed. \u201cYou picked this place. You have to sing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour sister picked this place,\u201d I shot back, looking to her. Shawna just shrugged innocently.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sung twice!\u201d he countered.</p><p>I deflected. \u201cMark hasn\u2019t sung anything.\u201d</p><p>My boss shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m doing you all a favor, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me. Squealing tires sound more lyrical than I do!\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo pushed the tablet with the song choices my way. It was the first time all night he\u2019d made any overture toward me, aside from saying hello at the entrance. He\u2019d spent most of the evening focused on Magdalene and Gage, which I tried not to take as a personal snub.</p><p>\u201cNo fair,\u201d I complained. \u201cYou\u2019re all ganging up on me! Gideon hasn\u2019t sung yet, either.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at my husband. He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll go up if you will.\u201d</p><p>Astonishment widened my eyes. I\u2019d never heard Gideon sing, had never even imagined it. Singers exposed and expressed emotion with their voices. Gideon\u2019s still waters ran very deep.</p><p>\u201cHell, you gotta do it now,\u201d Cary said, reaching over to tap the menu open at a random page.</p><p>My stomach twisted a little. I looked helplessly at the songs in front of me. One jumped out and I stared at it.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I stood. \u201cOkay. Just remember, you all asked for this. I don\u2019t want to hear any shit about how bad I suck.\u201d</p><p>Gideon, who\u2019d risen to his feet when I had, pulled me close and murmured in my ear, \u201cI think you suck excellently, angel.\u201d</p><p>I elbowed him in the ribs. His low laughter followed me as I made my way to the stage. I loved hearing that sound, loved spending time with him when we forgot our troubles and had fun with people who loved us. We were married, but we still had so much dating to catch up on, so many nights with friends yet to experience. Tonight was just the first of many, I hoped.</p><p>I regretted threatening the fragile peace with my song choice. But not enough to change my mind.</p><p>I high-fived Will as he and Natalie passed me on the way back to our group. I could have input my song choice into the tablet at the table, the same way we placed our food and drink orders, but I didn\u2019t want Gideon seeing the title.</p><p>Plus, I\u2019d noticed that every other party in the place had to wait for their turn in the queue, but our selections were fast-tracked. I was hoping that adding my name to the list in person would buy me some time to build up the courage I needed.</p><p>I should\u2019ve known better. When I gave the hostess my selection, she typed it into the system and said, \u201cOkay, stay right here. You\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d I glanced back at our table. Gideon winked at me.</p><p>Ooh, he was going to pay for that later.</p><p>The chick on the stage singing \u201cDiamonds\u201d wrapped it up, and the place exploded into applause. She\u2019d been decent, but really, the live band made up for a lot of faults. They were really good. I had my fingers crossed that they\u2019d be good enough for me, too.</p><p>I was shaking when I climbed the short steps to the stage. When the loud whistles and cheers erupted from our table, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh despite my nervousness. I gripped the mic in its stand and the beat kicked in immediately. The familiar song, one I loved, gave me the boost I needed to start.</p><p>Looking at Gideon, I warbled my way through the opening lyrics, telling him he was amazing. Even over the music, I could hear the laughter at my horrible voice. My own table erupted with it, but I had expected that.</p><p>I\u2019d chosen \u201cBrave.\u201d I had to be it to sing it\u2014that, or crazy.</p><p>I stayed focused on my husband, who wasn\u2019t laughing or smiling. He just stared intently at my face as I told him via Sara Bareilles\u2019s lyrics that I wanted to see him speak up and be brave.</p><p>The catchy composition plus the skill of the band backing me began to win over the crowd, who started singing along, more or less. My heart strengthened my voice, giving power to the message meant only for Gideon.</p><p>He needed to stop holding his silence. He needed to tell his family the truth. Not for me or for them, but for him.</p><p>When the song ended, my friends surged to their feet in applause and I grinned, energized. I gave a lavish bow and laughed when the strangers at the tables in front of the stage joined in the unearned praise. I knew my strengths. My singing voice certainly wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201cThat was fuckin\u2019 awesome!\u201d Shawna shouted when I got back to the table, grabbing me in a fierce hug. \u201cYou owned that, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to pay you later,\u201d I said dryly, feeling my face heat as the rest of our party kicked in with praise. \u201cYou guys are full of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, baby girl,\u201d Cary drawled, his green eyes bright with laughter, \u201cyou can\u2019t be good at everything. It\u2019s a relief to know you\u2019re flawed like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at him and picked up the fresh vodka cranberry sitting in front of my spot.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, lover boy,\u201d Arash goaded, grinning at Gideon.</p><p>My husband nodded, then looked at me. His face held no hint to his thoughts, and I began to worry. There was no softness on his lips or in his eyes, nothing to give me a clue.</p><p>And then some idiot started singing \u201cGolden.\u201d</p><p>Gideon stiffened, his jaw visibly tightening. Reaching for his hand, I gave it a squeeze and felt a bit of relief when he squeezed back.</p><p>He kissed my cheek and headed to the stage, cutting through the crowd with easy command. I watched him go, seeing other women\u2019s heads turn to follow him. I was biased, of course, but knew for a certainty that he was the most striking man in the room.</p><p>Seriously, it should be criminal for a man to be that sexy.</p><p>I looked at Arash and Arnoldo. \u201cHave either of you heard him sing?\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo shook his head.</p><p>Arash laughed. \u201cHell, no. With any luck, he\u2019ll sound like you. Like Cary says, he can\u2019t be good at everything or we\u2019d all have to hate him.\u201d</p><p>The guy onstage wrapped it up. A moment later, Gideon walked on. For some reason, my heart started pounding as badly as it had when I was up there. My palms grew clammy and I wiped them on my skirt.</p><p>I was afraid of what it would be like to watch Gideon up there. Much as I hated to think it, Brett was a hard act to follow and hearing \u201cGolden,\u201d even sung by someone who shouldn\u2019t ever have access to a microphone, brought those two worlds too close together.</p><p>Gideon grabbed the mic and pulled it off the stand as if he\u2019d done the move a thousand times before. The women in the audience went crazy, yelling about how hot he was and making suggestive remarks I chose to ignore. The man was delicious physically, but his commanding, confident presence was the real kicker.</p><p>He looked like a man who knew how to fuck a woman senseless. And God, did he ever.</p><p>\u201cThis one,\u201d he said, \u201cis for my wife.\u201d</p><p>With a pointed glance, Gideon signaled the band to start. An instantly recognizable bass beat ratcheted up my pulse.</p><p>\u201cLifehouse!\u201d Shawna crowed, clapping her hands. \u201cI love them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s calling you his wife already!\u201d Megumi yelled, leaning toward me. \u201cHow freakin\u2019 lucky are you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t glance at her. I couldn\u2019t. My attention was riveted on Gideon as he looked directly at me and sang, telling me in a lusciously raspy voice that he was desperate for change and starving for truth.</p><p>He was answering my song.</p><p>My eyes burned even as my heart began to beat with a different rhythm. Had I thought he\u2019d be unemotional? My God, he was killing me, baring his soul in the rough timbre of his voice.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Cary said, his eyes on the stage. \u201cThe man can sing.\u201d</p><p>I was hanging by a moment, too, hanging on to every word, hearing his message about chasing after me and falling more in love. I shifted in my seat, turned on beyond bearing.</p><p>Gideon dominated the attention of everyone in the bar. Of all the voices we\u2019d heard that night, his was truly professional grade. He stood in the single spotlight, feet set a foot apart, dressed elegantly while singing a rock song, and he made it work so well I couldn\u2019t imagine it sung any other way. There was no comparison to Brett, not in Gideon\u2019s delivery or my reaction to it.</p><p>I was on my feet before I knew it, making my way through the crowd to get to him. Gideon finished the song and the bar went ballistic, cutting off my route to him. I became lost in the crush, too short to see beyond the shoulders around me.</p><p>He found me, pushing his way through to catch me up in his arms. His mouth claimed mine, kissing me roughly, inciting a new round of catcalls and cheers. In the periphery, I heard the band begin a new song. I practically climbed up Gideon, panting in his ear, \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to explain. Setting me down, he grabbed my hand and led me across the bar and back through the kitchen to the service elevator. I plastered myself against him before the doors closed behind us, but he was pulling out his phone and lifting it to his ear, tilting his head back as my mouth slid feverishly over his throat.</p><p>\u201cBring the limo around,\u201d he ordered gruffly, and then the phone was back in his pocket and he was kissing me back with all the passion he\u2019d once kept locked inside.</p><p>Ravenous, I devoured him, catching his lower lip between my teeth and tasting it with swift lashes of my tongue. He groaned when I pushed him against the elevator\u2019s padded wall, my hands running down his chest to cup the heft of his erection in my palms.</p><p>\u201cEva . . . Christ.\u201d</p><p>We stopped descending and he exploded into movement, grabbing me by the elbow and pushing me ahead of him out the doors with brisk, impatient strides. We exited from a service hallway into the lobby, once again maneuvering through a crowd until we stepped out into the summer night heat. The limo idled in the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angus jumped out, quickly pulling the rear door open.</p><p>I scrambled in with Gideon crowding in behind me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go far,\u201d he told Angus.</p><p>We settled onto the bench seat with a foot of distance between us, both of us looking anywhere but at each other as the privacy partition slowly rose and the limo began to move.</p> <p>The moment the divider locked into place, I fell back against the seat and yanked my skirt up, brazenly tearing off my own clothes in my eagerness to be fucked.</p><p>As Gideon dropped to his knees on the floorboard, his hands went to his waistband, opening his slacks.</p><p>I shimmied out of my underwear, kicking them off along with my sandals.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d His growl had me moaning with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wet. I\u2019m wet,\u201d I chanted, not wanting him to play with me or wait.</p> <p>Still, he tested me, cupping my sex in his hand. His fingers parted me, stroking over my clit, pushing inside me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Eva. You\u2019re soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ride you,\u201d I begged, pushing away from the seat back. I wanted to set the pace, the depth, the rhythm . . .</p><p>Gideon pushed his pants and boxer briefs down to his knees, then sat on the bench, yanking his shirttails out of the way. His cock rose up thick and long between his thighs, as savagely beautiful as the rest of him.</p><p>I slid down to kneel between his legs, stroking his penis with my hands. He was hot and silky soft. My mouth was on him before I formulated the thought. His breath hissed out between his teeth, one hand grasping my ponytail as his head fell back.</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I swirled my tongue around the broad head, tasting him, feeling the thick veins throbbing against my palms. Tightening my lips, I pulled off, then sucked him back in.</p><p>He groaned and arched upward, pushing into my mouth. \u201cTake it deep.\u201d</p><p>I squirmed as I obeyed him, ragingly turned on by his pleasure. Gideon\u2019s eyes opened, his chin lowering so he could take in the sight of me.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d The low command sent a shiver of desire through me.</p><p>I crawled up his magnificent body, straddling his hips and draping my arms over his shoulders. \u201cYou are so fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re burning up, angel.\u201d</p><p>I moved my hips to position him. \u201cWait \u2019til you feel me from the inside.\u201d</p><p>He reached around me and gripped his cock, holding himself steady as I began to sink down. My legs shook as the thick crest of his penis pushed inside me, stretching me.</p> <p>\u201cGideon.\u201d The feeling of being taken, possessed, was one I never got over.</p><p>Gripping my hips, he supported me. I took him deeper, my eyes on his as they grew heavy. A rumbling sound filled the space between us and I grew slicker, hotter.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how many times I had him, I always wanted more. More of the way he responded to me, as if nothing had ever felt the same, as if I gave him something he could get nowhere else.</p><p>I clung to the back of the seat and rolled my hips, taking a little more. I could feel him pressing against the deepest part of me, but I couldn\u2019t fit all of him. I wanted to. I wanted everything he had.</p><p>\u201cOur first time,\u201d he said hoarsely, watching me. \u201cYou rode me right here, drove me out of my mind. You blew the top of my fucking head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was so good,\u201d I breathed, dangerously close to coming. He was so thick, so hard. \u201cAh, God. It\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><p>His fingers dug into my hips. \u201cI want you more now.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, I pressed my temple to his. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Yanking my hips down, he thrust upward, shoving into me. \u201cTake it, Eva. Take it all.\u201d</p><p>I cried out and ground into him, moving on instinct, taking the last of him.</p><p>\u201cYes . . . yes . . .\u201d I gasped, slamming my hips into his, pumping my sex up and down the rigid length of his erection.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s face was harsh with lust, brutally etched with his need. \u201cI\u2019m going to come so hard for you,\u201d he promised darkly. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel me in you all night.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his voice . . . the way he\u2019d looked onstage . . . I\u2019d never been so excited. He wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d be coming hard.</p><p>His head fell back against the seat, his chest heaving, harsh sounds of pleasure scraping from his throat. His hands released me, clenching into fists against the seat. He let me fuck him the way I needed to, let me use him.</p><p>Arching back, I climaxed with a cry, my entire body shaking, my sex grasping, rippling along his cock. My rhythm faltered, my vision blackened. An endless moan poured out of me, the relief dizzying.</p><p>The world shifted and I was on my back, Gideon rising over me, his arm hooking beneath my left leg to lift it to his shoulder. He dug his feet into the floorboard, thrusting again and again, sinking deep. So deep.</p><p>I writhed, the feel of him so good it hurt.</p><p>He kept me pinned, opened and defenseless, using me as I\u2019d used him, his control shattered by the need to orgasm. The power of his body as he pounded into me, the force with which he drove his cock into my tender sex, had me quivering on the verge again.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I moaned, my hands stroking down his flexing thighs.</p><p>He growled my name and started coming, his teeth clenching, his hips pressed tight to my own, screwing deep. It set me off, the feel of him coming inside me.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he groaned, rocking into the spasms of my sex.</p><p>We strained together, grasping at each other.</p><p>He buried his face in my throat. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung my eyes. He said the words so rarely.</p><p>\u201cTell me again,\u201d I begged, holding on to him.</p><p>His mouth found mine. \u201cI love you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cMORE,\u201d I demanded, licking my lips.</p><p>Gideon glanced over his shoulder at me. Bacon sizzled in the pan in front of him and my mouth watered for another slice. \u201cAnd here I\u2019d thought two packs of bacon would last us all weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrease is a must after a night of drinking,\u201d I told him, wiping some off my plate with my fingertip and lifting it to my mouth. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not hung over, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I am,\u201d Cary muttered, walking into the kitchen in just his jeans, which he hadn\u2019t bothered buttoning all the way. \u201cGot any beer?\u201d</p><p>Gideon pointed at the fridge with his tongs. \u201cBottom drawer.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at my best friend. \u201cHair of the dog this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. My head feels like it\u2019s splitting in two.\u201d Cary pulled a beer out and joined me at the island. He popped the cap off and tipped the bottle back, gulping down half the contents at once.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you sleep?\u201d I asked, mentally crossing my fingers.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed the night in the attached single-bedroom apartment, and I hoped he loved it. It had all the beautiful prewar details of Gideon\u2019s penthouse and was furnished similarly. I knew Cary\u2019s style was more contemporary, but he couldn\u2019t fault the view of Central Park. All the rest could be changed, if he just said the word.</p><p>He lowered the bottle from his mouth. \u201cLike the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like the apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Who wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to live there?\u201d I persisted.</p><p>Cary gave me a lopsided smile. \u201cYeah, baby girl. It\u2019s a dream. Thank you for the pity fuck, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>My husband turned away from the stove with a plate of bacon in his hand. \u201cThere is neither pity nor fucking included in the offer,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I clapped my hands. \u201cYay! I\u2019m stoked.\u201d</p><p>Gideon snagged a piece of bacon and stuck it in his mouth. Leaning forward, I parted my lips. He bent toward me, letting me bite off the end.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Cary groaned. \u201cI\u2019m fighting nausea as it is.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him gently. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and finished his beer. \u201cGotta give you guys a hard time. Who else is going to stop you two from singing \u2018I Got You, Babe\u2019 in a few years?\u201d</p><p>Thinking of Will and Natalie made me smile. I\u2019d discovered even more to like about Will and found that I got along well with his girl, too. \u201cAren\u2019t they adorable? They\u2019ve been together since high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point,\u201d he drawled. \u201cSpend enough years with someone and either you start bickering or you fall down the lovey-dovey hole, never to be seen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark and Steven have been together for years, too,\u201d I argued. \u201cThey don\u2019t fight or moon at each other.\u201d</p><p>He shot me a look. \u201cThey\u2019re gay, Eva. No estrogen in the mix to cause drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You sexist pig! You did not just say that.\u201d</p><p>Cary glanced at Gideon. \u201cYou know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with that,\u201d Gideon declared, grabbing three strips of bacon, \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I complained after him, as he exited to the living room.</p><p>My best friend laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He hitched himself to your brand of female.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him as I munched another piece of bacon. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a pass, because I owe you for last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fun. Megumi\u2019s good people.\u201d His humor fled, his face darkening. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she\u2019s going through what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make any decisions about how you\u2019re going to help others like her?\u201d</p><p>I set my elbows on the island. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Gideon about working with his Crossroads Foundation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. Why didn\u2019t you think of that before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . . I\u2019m stubborn, I guess.\u201d I glanced over my shoulder at the living room, then lowered my voice. \u201cOne of the things Gideon likes about me is that I don\u2019t always do everything he wants just because he wants it. He\u2019s not like Stanton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want to be like your mom. Does this mean you\u2019re keeping your maiden name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. It means a lot to Gideon for me to become Eva Cross. Besides, it sounds kick-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d He tapped the end of my nose with his finger. \u201cI\u2019m here for you when you need me.\u201d</p><p>Sliding off the stool, I hugged him. \u201cSame goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you up on that, obviously.\u201d His chest heaved with a deep sigh. \u201cBig changes happening, baby girl. You ever get scared?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him, feeling the affinity that had gotten us both through some hard times. \u201cMore than I let myself think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to run to the office,\u201d Gideon interjected, stepping back into the kitchen wearing a Yankees ball cap. He\u2019d kept the same gray T-shirt on but had swapped out his pajama bottoms for sweats. A ring of keys twirled around his finger. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d I asked, backing away from Cary. My husband was wearing his game face, the one that told me his mind was already on whatever he was going to deal with.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201d He came to me and gave me a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a couple of hours. Ireland won\u2019t be here \u2019til six.\u201d</p><p>He left. I stared after him.</p><p>What was important enough to drag him away from me on a weekend? Gideon was possessive about a lot of things when it came to me, but our time together topped the list. And the key-twirling thing was kind of weird. Gideon wasn\u2019t a man given to wasted movement. The only times I\u2019d seen him fidget were when he was completely relaxed or the opposite\u2014ready to throw down.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was hiding something from me. As usual.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower,\u201d Cary said, grabbing a bottled water out of the fridge. \u201cYou want to watch a movie when I get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said absently. \u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>I waited until he\u2019d gone back into the attached apartment, then went to find my phone.</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cWHERE\u2019S EVA?\u201d</p><p>I rounded the front of the Benz and stepped onto the curb in front of Brett Kline. My fingers twitched, the habit of extending my hand in greeting ruthlessly suppressed. The singer\u2019s hands had touched my wife intimately in the past . . . and recently. I didn\u2019t want to shake them. I wanted to break them.</p><p>\u201cAt our home,\u201d I answered, gesturing at the entrance to the Crossfire Building. \u201cLet\u2019s go up to my office.\u201d</p><p>Kline smiled coldly. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that all by yourself.\u201d I noted the worn Pete\u2019s T-shirt he was wearing with black jeans and leather boots. Without a doubt, his choice of attire wasn\u2019t a coincidence. He wanted to remind Eva of their history together. Maybe even remind me, too. Had Yimara given him the idea? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</p><p>It was the wrong move for both men to have made.</p><p>He walked through the revolving doors ahead of me. Security took his information and printed out a temporary ID, then we headed through the turnstiles to the elevators. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t intimidate me with your money,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>I entered the car and hit the button for the top floor. \u201cThere are eyes and ears all over the city. At least in my office, I know we won\u2019t be putting on a show.\u201d</p><p>His lip curled in disgust. \u201cIs that all you care about? Public perception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ironic question, considering who you are and what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t act like you know me,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou know shit.\u201d</p><p>In the confined space of the elevator car, Kline\u2019s aggression and frustration permeated the space between us. His hands gripped the handrail behind him, his stance hostile and expectant. From the platinum tips of his spiked hair to the black-and-gray tattoos covering his arms, the front man of Six-Ninths couldn\u2019t be more different from me in appearance. I used to feel threatened by that and his history with Eva, but no longer.</p><p>Not after San Diego. And certainly not after last night.</p><p>I could still feel the marks of Eva\u2019s nails in my back and ass. She\u2019d pushed me to my limits all night and into the early hours of the morning. The insatiable hunger she felt for me left no room for anyone else. And the catch in her voice when she told me she loved me, the sheen of tears in her eyes when I yielded to what she did to me . . .</p><p>I leaned back against the opposite wall and tucked my hands into the pockets of my sweats, knowing my nonchalance would goad him.</p> <p>\u201cDoes she know we\u2019re meeting like this?\u201d he asked harshly.</p><p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d leave it up to you to decide whether to mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m mentioning it all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you do.\u201d</p><p>We exited into the Cross Industries foyer and I led him through the security doors and back to my office. There were a few people at their desks and I took note of them. Those who worked on their days off weren\u2019t always better employees than those who didn\u2019t, but I respected ambition and rewarded it.</p><p>When we got to my office, I shut the doors behind us and frosted the glass. A folder sat on my desk, as I\u2019d instructed before leaving the penthouse. I set my hand atop it and gestured for Kline to take a seat.</p> <p>He remained standing. \u201cWhat the fuck is this about? I come into town to see Eva and your goon brings me here instead.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cgoon\u201d was security provided by Vidal Records, but he wasn\u2019t wrong in thinking the man worked for me. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to offer you a great deal of money\u2014along with other incentives\u2014for the exclusive rights to the Yimara footage of you and Eva.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a hard smile. \u201cSam told me you were going to try this. That tape is none of your business. It\u2019s between me and Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the entire world if it leaks, and that would destroy her. Does that matter to you at all, how she feels about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to leak, and of course I give a shit about how she feels. It\u2019s one of the reasons we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou want to ask her what you can use. You think you can talk her into letting you exploit some of it.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his feet, a restless move that signaled a direct hit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get the answer you hope for,\u201d I told him. \u201cThe very existence of that tape horrifies her. You\u2019re an idiot if you think otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all sex. There\u2019s some good stuff of us hanging out. Her and I, we had something. She wasn\u2019t just a lay to me.\u201d</p><p>Piece of shit. I had to control the impulse to deck him.</p><p>He smirked. \u201cNot that you\u2019d understand. You had no problem banging away at that brunette until I came back into the picture, then you changed up your game. Eva\u2019s a toy you got bored with. Until someone else wanted her.\u201d</p><p>His mention of Corinne hit a harsh chord. The charade of dating my ex had nearly cost me Eva, a close call that still haunted me.</p><p>That didn\u2019t prevent me from noticing how good he was at shifting the blame. \u201cEva knows what she means to me.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer to my desk. \u201cShe\u2019s too blinded by your billions to realize there\u2019s something really wrong with you hiding that bogus wedding in a foreign country. Is it even legal?\u201d</p><p>It was a question I\u2019d anticipated. \u201cAbsolutely legal.\u201d</p><p>Opening the folder, I pulled out the photo inside. It was taken on the day of my wedding, at the very moment I first kissed Eva as her husband. The beach and the pastor who had officiated at the ceremony were behind us. I cupped her face, our lips touching softly. Her hands held my wrists, my ring sparkling on her finger.</p><p>I turned the picture around so that it faced him. I slid a copy of the marriage license into place beside it. I used my left hand, proudly displaying my ruby-encrusted wedding band.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sharing such personal things to prove a point. I intended to provoke Kline, which I\u2019d been deliberately doing from the moment he arrived in New York. When he reached out to my wife again, I wanted him off-balance and at a disadvantage.</p><p>\u201cSo you and Eva are done,\u201d I said evenly. \u201cIf you doubted it, now you know it for sure. In any case, I don\u2019t think you want my wife as much as you want the memory of her for the band\u2019s use.\u201d</p><p>Kline laughed. \u201cYeah, paint me as the sleaze. You can\u2019t handle the thought of her seeing that tape. You\u2019ve never made her get that wild and you never will.\u201d</p><p>My forearms twitched with the need to pound the smugness out of his face. \u201cBelieve what you like. Here are your options: You can take the two million I\u2019m offering, give me the footage, and walk away\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your damn money!\u201d Setting his hands on the edge of my desk, he leaned toward me. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to own my memories. You may have her\u2014for now\u2014but I have those. Fuck if I\u2019m selling them to you.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Kline watching the footage . . . watching himself fuck my wife . . . set my blood on a slow boil. The thought of him suggesting that Eva sit through a viewing of it, knowing how that would shatter her, pushed me to the raw edge of violence.</p><p>Keeping my tone even was a struggle. \u201cYou can reject the money and keep the existence of the footage to yourself until you die. Make it a secret gift to Eva she never has to know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can be a selfish asshole,\u201d I continued, \u201cand hit her up with it, shocking her with the goal of destroying her marriage and making yourself more famous.\u201d</p><p>I stared him down. Kline stood his ground, but his gaze dropped for a fraction of a second. A small victory, for what it was worth.</p><p>With a swipe of my hand, I withdrew the contract Arash had drawn up. \u201cIf you care about her at all, you\u2019ll make a different decision than the one that brought you to New York.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the documents off my desk and ripped them in half, throwing the pieces back onto the glass. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until I see her.\u201d</p><p>Kline strode out of my office, bristling with anger.</p><p>I watched him go. Then I placed a call via a secure line. \u201cDid I give you enough time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We took care of the laptop and tablet in his luggage as soon as you took him upstairs. We\u2019re handling his e-mail and backup provider servers as we speak, and the backups to those servers. We searched his residence over the weekend, but he hasn\u2019t been there in weeks. We cleaned everything on both Yimara and Kline\u2019s equipment, as well as the accounts and equipment of those who received teasers of the full-length footage. One of the execs at Vidal had a full copy on his hard drive, but we wiped it. We found no evidence that he forwarded it anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Ice slid through my veins. \u201cWhich executive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. I gripped the edge of my desk so hard my knuckles cracked with the strain. I remembered the video of Christopher with Magdalene, knew how perverse his hatred toward me was. Thinking about him seeing Eva so intimately . . . so vulnerable . . . took me to a place I hadn\u2019t been since I\u2019d first heard about Nathan.</p><p>I had to believe that the private military security firm I\u2019d hired had dealt with the situation thoroughly. Their tech teams were trained to handle far more sensitive information.</p><p>I shoved the mess on my desk into the folder. \u201cI need that footage to cease to exist anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. We\u2019re on it. Still, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s a hard copy floating around, although we\u2019ve searched Kline and Yimara\u2019s transaction records for security deposit boxes and the like. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation until you say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>I never would. I\u2019d search for a lifetime, if that was what it took, for any hint that the footage survived somewhere outside of my control. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, I left my office and headed home to Eva.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE really good with those,\u201d Ireland said, eyeing Eva as she lifted a chopstickful of kung pao chicken from its white box to her mouth. \u201cI never got the hang of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, try holding them like this.\u201d</p><p>I watched my wife adjust my sister\u2019s grip on the slender sticks, her blond head a bright contrast against Ireland\u2019s black hair. Sitting on the floor at my feet, they both wore shorts and tank tops, their tanned legs stretched out beneath the coffee table, one long and lean, the other petite and voluptuous.</p><p>I was more of an observer than a participant, sitting on the couch behind them and envying their easy rapport even while I was grateful for it.</p><p>It was all so surreal. I hadn\u2019t ever imagined a night like that, a quiet evening at home with . . . family. I didn\u2019t know how to contribute or even if I could. What could I say? How should I feel?</p><p>Besides awed. And thankful. So very thankful for my amazing wife, who brought so much to my life.</p><p>Not long ago, on a similar Saturday night, I would have been at a highly publicized social function or event, focusing on business unless or until a woman\u2019s keen interest spurred a need to fuck. Whether I returned to the penthouse by myself or ended up at the hotel with a one-night stand, I\u2019d be alone. And since I hardly remembered what it felt like to belong anywhere, to anyone, I didn\u2019t know what I was missing.</p><p>\u201cHa! Look at that,\u201d Ireland crowed, holding up a tiny bit of orange chicken, which she promptly ate. \u201cMade it to my mouth.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the wine in my glass in a single gulp, wanting to say something. My mind raced with options, all of which sounded insincere and contrived. In the end what came out was, \u201cThe chopsticks have a large target. Ups your chances.\u201d</p><p>Ireland turned her head toward me, revealing the same blue eyes I saw in the mirror every day. They were much less guarded, far more innocent, and bright with laughter and adoration. \u201cDid you just call me a big mouth?\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, I ran my hand over the crown of her head, touching the silky soft strands of her hair. Those, too, were like mine and yet not. \u201cNot my words,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words,\u201d she corrected, leaning briefly into my touch before turning back to Eva.</p><p>Eva glanced up at me, offering an encouraging smile. She knew I drew strength from her, and she gave it unconditionally.</p><p>My throat tight, I rose from the couch and grabbed Eva\u2019s empty wineglass. Ireland\u2019s glass of soda was still half full, so I left it and headed to the kitchen, trying to regain enough equanimity to make it through the rest of the evening.</p><p>\u201cChanning Tatum is so hot,\u201d Ireland said, her voice traveling from the living room. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I frowned. My baby sister\u2019s idle question triggered uncomfortable thoughts of her dating. She had to have started a few years ago\u2014she was seventeen. I knew it was unrealistic to want her to stay away from boys. I knew it was my fault that I\u2019d missed so much of her childhood. But the thought of her having to deal with younger versions of men like me and Manuel and Cary roused an unfamiliar defensive reaction.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good-looking,\u201d Eva agreed.</p><p>Possessiveness rose to join the mix. My gaze narrowed on the two glasses in front of me as I refilled them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s this year\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive,\u201d Ireland said. \u201cLook at those biceps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now on that, I have to totally disagree. Gideon is way sexier.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a goner,\u201d my sister teased. \u201cYour pupils turn into little hearts when you think about Gideon. It\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>Ireland\u2019s musical laugh floated through the air. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s goofy over you, too. And he\u2019s been on every Sexiest Man Alive list for ages. I never hear the end of it from my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah. Don\u2019t tell me stuff like that. I\u2019m jealous by nature.\u201d</p><p>Laughing inwardly, I dropped the empty bottle into the recycling bin.</p><p>\u201cSo is Gideon. He\u2019s going to flip out when you start hitting the Hottest Women Alive lists. No way to avoid it now that everyone\u2019s heard of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Eva scoffed. \u201cThey\u2019d have to Photoshop fifteen pounds off my ass and thighs to sell that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, have you seen Kim Kardashian? Or Jennifer Lopez?\u201d</p><p>I paused on the threshold of the living room, taking in the picture Ireland and Eva made over the rim of my glass. An ache bloomed in my chest. I wanted to freeze the moment, protect it, keep it safe forever.</p><p>Ireland looked up and spotted me, then rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cGoofy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2014</p><p>SITTING back in my chair, I sipped coffee and studied the spreadsheet on my monitor. I rolled my shoulders back, trying to loosen the kink in my neck.</p><p>\u201cDude. What the hell? It\u2019s three in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to find Ireland standing in the doorway to my home office. \u201cYour point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you working so late?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you Skyping so late?\u201d I countered, having heard her laughter and occasionally raised voice over the last hour or so since I\u2019d left Eva sleeping.</p><p>\u201cWhatev,\u201d she muttered, coming in and dropping into one of the chairs in front of my desk. She slouched, her shoulders even with the chair back and her legs sprawled out in front of her. \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t know how literally true that was. With Ireland sleeping in Eva\u2019s bed and Eva sleeping in mine, I couldn\u2019t risk going to sleep myself. There was only so much I could expect Eva to take, only so many times I could frighten her before it destroyed the love she felt for me.</p><p>\u201cChristopher texted me a bit ago,\u201d she said. \u201cGuess Dad\u2019s staying at a hotel.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose.</p><p>She nodded, her face forlorn. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, Gideon. They haven\u2019t spent a night apart ever. At least that I can remember.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what to say. Our mother had been calling me all day, leaving messages on my voice mail and ringing the penthouse so often I\u2019d been forced to disconnect the main receiver so that none of the phones would ring. I hated that my mother was struggling, but I had to protect my time with Ireland and Eva.</p><p>It felt heartless to focus on myself, but I\u2019d already lost my family twice before\u2014once when my father died and again after Hugh. I couldn\u2019t afford to lose any more. I didn\u2019t think I could survive it a third time, not with Eva in my life.</p><p>\u201cI just wish I knew what caused the fight,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean as long as they didn\u2019t cheat on each other, they should be able to get through it, right?\u201d</p><p>Exhaling roughly, I straightened. \u201cI\u2019m not the person to ask about relationships. I have no idea how they work. I\u2019m just stumbling my way through, praying not to fuck things up, and grateful that Eva is so forgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really love her.\u201d</p><p>I followed her gaze to the collage of photos on the wall. It hurt sometimes, looking at those pictures of my wife. I wanted to recapture and relive every moment. I wanted to hoard every second I\u2019d ever had with her. I hated that time slipped away so quickly and I couldn\u2019t bank it for the uncertain future.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I murmured. I\u2019d forgive Eva anything. There was nothing she could do or say that would break us apart, because I couldn\u2019t live without her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Gideon.\u201d Ireland smiled when I looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The worry in her eyes lingered and sparked restlessness. I wanted to fix the problems troubling her, but I didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cCould you talk to Mom?\u201d she suggested. \u201cNot now, of course. But tomorrow? Maybe you can find out what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated a moment, knowing a conversation with our mother was certain to be unproductive. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Ireland studied her nails. \u201cYou don\u2019t like Mom very much, do you?\u201d</p><p>Weighing my answer carefully, I said, \u201cWe have a fundamental difference of opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I get it. It\u2019s like she\u2019s got this weird form of OCD that applies to her family. Everyone has to be a particular way or at least pretend to be. She\u2019s so worried about what people think. I saw an old movie the other day that reminded me of her. Ordinary People. Ever seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, can\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should watch it. It has Kiefer Sutherland\u2019s dad in it and some other people. It\u2019s sad, but it\u2019s a good story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look it up.\u201d Feeling the need to explain our mother, I tried my best. \u201cWhat she dealt with after my father died . . . It was brutal. She\u2019s insulated herself since then, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s mother says Mom used to be different before. You know, when she was married to your dad.\u201d</p><p>I set my cooled coffee aside. \u201cI do remember her differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s subjective. She was more . . . spontaneous. Carefree.\u201d</p><p>Ireland rubbed at her mouth with her fingertips. \u201cDo you think it broke her? Losing your dad?\u201d</p><p>My chest tightened. \u201cIt changed her,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d She sat up, visibly shaking off her melancholy. \u201cYou going to be awake awhile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna watch that movie with me?\u201d</p><p>The suggestion surprised me. And pleased me. \u201cDepends. You can\u2019t tell me what happens. No spoilers.\u201d</p><p>She shot me a look. \u201cI already told you it\u2019s sad. If you want happily ever after, she\u2019s sleeping down the hall.\u201d</p><p>That made me smile. Standing, I rounded my desk. \u201cYou find the movie, I\u2019ll grab the soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beer would be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on my watch.\u201d</p><p>She pushed to her feet with a grin. \u201cOkay, fine. Wine, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me again in a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have kids by then. It won\u2019t be as fun.\u201d</p><p>I paused, hit by anxiety sharp enough to mist my skin with sweat. The thought of having a baby with Eva both thrilled and terrified me. It wasn\u2019t safe for my wife to live with me. How could it ever be safe for a child?</p><p>Ireland laughed. \u201cHoly fuck, you should see your face! A classic case of playboy panic. Didn\u2019t they tell you? First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby in the baby carriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t shut up, I\u2019m sending you to bed.\u201d</p><p>She laughed harder and linked her arm with mine. \u201cYou\u2019re a riot. Seriously. I\u2019m just messing with you. Don\u2019t flip out on me. I\u2019ve got enough family members doing that.\u201d</p><p>I willed my heart to stop pounding so damn hard.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have a drink,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cI think I will,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give major props to Eva for getting a ring out of you. Did you have a panic attack when you proposed, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Ireland.\u201d</p><p>Leaning her head against my shoulder, she giggled and led me out of my office.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE sun had been up for over two hours by the time I returned to bed. I stripped silently, my gaze roaming over the delectable bump under the covers that was my wife.</p><p>Eva was curled in a ball, mostly hidden except for the bright strands of hair splayed over the pillow. My mind filled in the blanks, knowing she was naked between the sheets.</p><p>Mine. All mine.</p><p>It killed me to sleep away from her. I knew it hurt her, too.</p><p>Lifting the edge of the blankets, I slid in beside her. She gave a soft little moan and rolled toward me, her lush warm body wriggling into place against me.</p><p>I was instantly hard. Desire simmered in my blood; awareness tingled along my skin. It was combustible sexual chemistry but also something more. Something deeper. A strange, wonderful, frightening recognition.</p><p>She filled an emptiness in me I hadn\u2019t known was there.</p><p>Eva buried her face in my throat and hummed softly, her legs tangling with mine, her hands gliding over my back. \u201cHard and yummy all over,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cAll over,\u201d I agreed, cupping her ass and pulling her tighter against my hard-on.</p><p>Her shoulders shook with a silent laugh. \u201cWe have to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She nipped at my throat. \u201cYou\u2019re the noisy one.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wrong. As rough and impatient as I could get when aroused, I\u2019d never been loud . . . until her. It was a struggle to be discreet when situations called for it. She felt too good, made me feel too much.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll take it slow,\u201d I murmured, my hands roaming greedily over her silky skin. \u201cIreland will be sleeping for hours; there\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHours, huh?\u201d Laughing, she pulled back and rolled away from me, reaching for the nightstand drawer. \u201cOverachiever.\u201d</p><p>Tension stretched across my shoulders as she dug out the breath mints she kept handy. I was reminded of similar situations, when women had reached into the nightstand drawer for condoms.</p><p>Eva and I had used condoms only twice. Before her, I\u2019d never fucked a woman without one. Avoiding pregnancy was something I\u2019d religiously adhered to.</p><p>Yet since those first two times with Eva, we\u2019d gone bare, relying on her birth control to prevent conception.</p><p>It was a risk. I knew that. And considering how often I had her\u2014at least two, sometimes three or four times a day\u2014the risk was not inconsiderable.</p><p>I thought of it sometimes. I questioned my control, my selfishness in putting my own pleasure above the consequences. But the reason for my recklessness wasn\u2019t as simple as pleasure. If it were, I could deal. Be responsible.</p><p>No, it was much more complicated.</p><p>The need to come inside her was primitive. It was a conquest and surrender in one.</p><p>I had wanted to fuck her raw before I\u2019d even had her the first time, before I knew definitively how explosive it would be between us. I\u2019d gone so far as to warn her prior to our first date that I needed it, needed her to give me that, something I\u2019d never wanted with anyone else.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d I said roughly, sliding over her while she was still stretched out on her stomach. My hand pushed between her hip and the bed, reaching between her legs to cup her cunt in my palm. She was moist and warm. My stroking fingers made her slick and hot.</p><p>She muffled a moan.</p><p>\u201cI want you just like this,\u201d I told her, brushing my lips across her cheek.</p><p>Reaching for my pillow with my free hand, I yanked it over and then shoved it under her, lifting her hips to an angle that would let me sink balls-deep.</p><p>\u201cGideon . . .\u201d The way she said my name was a plea, as if I wouldn\u2019t get down on my knees and beg for the privilege of having her.</p><p>I shifted, urging her legs apart and pinning her wrists beside her head. Holding her down, I thrust into her. She was ready for me, plush and tight and wet. My teeth gritted together to restrain the growl that surged from my throat, a tremor racking my body from head to toe. My chest heaved against her back, my violent exhalations ruffling her hair lying across the pillow.</p><p>Just like that, just by taking me, she had me right on the edge.</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d My hips churned without volition, screwing my cock into her, pushing me deeper until I was in her to the hilt. I could feel her all around me, from root to tip, clenching in ripples that milked me like a greedy little mouth. \u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p><p>The pressure at the base of my dick was insistent, but I was capable of staving it off. It wasn\u2019t a question of control, but of will.</p><p>I wanted to come inside her. Wanted it enough to consider the risk\u2014as terrifying as it was\u2014acceptable.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I dropped my forehead to her cheek. I inhaled the scent of her and let go, coming hard, my ass flexing as I filled her up in thick, hot spurts.</p><p>Eva whimpered, writhing under me. Her cunt tightened, then trembled around my cock. She climaxed with a soft, sweet moan.</p><p>I growled her name, searingly aroused by her orgasm. She came because I did, because my pleasure turned her on as much as my touch. I would reward her for that, show her the depth of my gratitude. She would get hers, over and over again, as many times as she could take it.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d I rubbed my damp cheek against hers. \u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened their grip on mine. Her head turned, her lips seeking.</p><p>\u201cAce,\u201d she breathed into the kiss. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>IT was shortly after five in the evening when I drove the Bentley through the gates of the Vidal estate in Dutchess County and into the circular drive out front.</p><p>\u201cAw, you drove too fast,\u201d Ireland complained from the backseat. \u201cWe\u2019re here already.\u201d</p><p>I put the SUV in park and left it idling. One look at the house, and a knot tightened in my gut. Eva reached over, taking my hand and giving it a squeeze. I focused on her steely gray eyes instead of the Tudor-style mansion at her back.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, but she didn\u2019t have to. I felt her love and support and saw the glimmer of anger in her eyes. Just knowing she understood gave me strength. She knew every dark and dirty secret I had, and yet she believed and loved me anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to stay over again sometime,\u201d Ireland said, poking her head between the two front seats. \u201cIt was fun, right?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile more than made the promise worth what it would cost me in sleep and anxiety. I\u2019d stayed away from her for many reasons, but the main one was that I didn\u2019t know what I could offer her of any value. I\u2019d channeled everything into keeping Vidal Records afloat for her well into the future, taking care of her the only way I knew I wouldn\u2019t screw up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to help me out,\u201d I told her honestly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a brother. You will probably have to forgive me. Frequently.\u201d</p><p>The smile left Ireland\u2019s face, transforming her from a teenager to a young woman. \u201cWell, it\u2019s like being a friend,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cExcept you have to remember birthdays and holidays, you have to forgive me for everything, and you should introduce me to all your hot, rich guy friends.\u201d</p><p>My brow lifted. \u201cWhere\u2019s the part about me picking on you and giving you a hard time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed those years,\u201d she shot back. \u201cNo do-overs.\u201d</p> <p>She meant to tease, but the words struck home. I had missed years and I couldn\u2019t get them back.</p><p>\u201cYou get to pick on her boyfriends instead,\u201d Eva said, \u201cand give them a hard time.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes met and I knew she understood exactly what I was thinking. My thumb stroked over her knuckles.</p><p>Behind her, the front door opened and my mother stepped out. She stood on the wide top step dressed in a white tunic and matching pants. Her long, dark hair hung loosely around her shoulders. From a distance, she looked so much like Ireland, more of a sister than a parent.</p><p>My grip on Eva\u2019s hand tightened.</p><p>Ireland sighed and opened her door. \u201cI wish you guys didn\u2019t have to work tomorrow. I mean, what\u2019s the point of being a gazillionaire if you can\u2019t play hooky when you want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf Eva worked with me,\u201d I said, looking at my wife, \u201cwe could.\u201d</p><p>She stuck her tongue out. \u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>I lifted her hand to my mouth and kissed the back. \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d</p><p>Opening my door, I stepped out of the car and hit the hatch release. I rounded the back of the car to retrieve Ireland\u2019s bag and found my arms full of her instead. She hugged me tightly, her slender arms wrapped around my waist. It took me a moment to unfreeze from my surprise, and then I hugged her back, my cheek coming to rest on the crown of her head.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she mumbled into my chest. \u201cThanks for having me over.\u201d</p><p>My throat closed tight, preventing me from saying anything. She was gone as quickly as she\u2019d come at me, her duffel in hand as she met Eva on the passenger side and hugged her, too.</p><p>Feeling as winded as if I\u2019d been punched, I closed the hatch and watched as my mother met Ireland halfway across the blue-gray gravel drive. I was about to return to the wheel and leave, when she signaled at me to wait.</p><p>I glanced at Eva. \u201cGet in the car, angel.\u201d</p> <p>She looked as if she might argue, and then she nodded and slid back into the front passenger seat and closed the door.</p><p>I waited until my mother came to me.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d She caught me by the biceps and lifted onto her tiptoes to press a kiss to my mouth. \u201cWon\u2019t you and Eva come in? You drove all this way.\u201d</p><p>I took a step backward, breaking her hold. \u201cAnd we have to drive back.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze reflected her disappointment. \u201cJust for a few minutes. Please. I\u2019d like to apologize to both of you. I haven\u2019t handled the news of your engagement well and I\u2019m sorry about that. This should be a happy time for our family, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been too worried about losing my son to appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d I caught her arm when she moved toward the passenger side. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean all those things I said about Eva the other day. It was just a shock, seeing the ring your father gave me on another woman\u2019s hand. You didn\u2019t give the ring to Corinne, so I was surprised. You can understand that, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou antagonized Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what she told you?\u201d She paused. \u201cI never meant to, but\u2014 Never mind. Your father was very protective, too. You\u2019re so like him.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, gazing absently at the trees beyond the drive. I never knew how to take comparisons to Geoffrey Cross. Were they meant as praise or a backhanded compliment? There was no telling with my mother.</p><p>\u201cGideon . . . please, I\u2019m trying. I said some things to Eva I shouldn\u2019t have, and she responded as any woman would under the circumstances. I just want to smooth things over.\u201d She set her hand over my heart. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Gideon. And I\u2019m so glad to see you and Ireland spending time together. I know it means so much to her.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her hand away gently. \u201cIt means a lot to me, too. And Eva made it possible in ways I won\u2019t explain. Which is just one of the reasons I won\u2019t have her upset. Not now. She has to work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make plans for lunch this week, then. Or dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Chris be there?\u201d Eva asked through the window before pushing the door open again and stepping out. She stood there, so small and bright against the dark hulking SUV, formidable in the way her shoulders were set.</p><p>My wife would fight the world for me. It was miraculous to know that. When no one else had fought for me, I\u2019d somehow found the one soul who would.</p><p>My mother\u2019s lips curved. \u201cOf course. Chris and I are a team.\u201d</p><p>I noted the brittleness of her smile and doubted her, as I so often did. Still, I conceded. \u201cWe\u2019ll make plans. Call Scott tomorrow and we\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s face brightened. \u201cI\u2019m so glad. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She hugged me and I braced myself, my body stiff with the need to push her away. When she approached Eva with her arms outstretched, Eva thrust out her hand between them to shake instead. The interaction was awkward, with both women so obviously on the defensive.</p><p>My mother didn\u2019t want to mend fences; she wanted an agreement to pretend the fences were sound.</p><p>We said good-bye, and then I slid into the driver\u2019s seat. Eva and I took off, leaving the estate behind us. We hadn\u2019t gone far when she said, \u201cWhen did your mother talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Damn it. I knew what that bite in her tone signified.</p><p>Reaching over, I set my hand on her knee. \u201cI don\u2019t want you worrying about my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me worrying about anything! That\u2019s not the way this is gonna work. You don\u2019t get to deal with all the crap alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat my mother says or does isn\u2019t important, Eva. I don\u2019t give a shit and neither should you.\u201d</p><p>She twisted in the seat to face me. \u201cYou need to start sharing stuff. Especially things that have to do with me, like your mother saying things behind my back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have you getting pissed off over an irrelevant opinion.\u201d The road curved. I accelerated out of the turn.</p><p>\u201cThat would be better than me getting pissed off at you!\u201d she snapped. \u201cPull over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I glanced at her.</p><p>\u201cPull the damn car over!\u201d</p><p>Cursing inwardly, I removed my hand from her leg and gripped the wheel. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m mad at you, and you\u2019re sitting there looking all hot and sexy driving and you need to stop.\u201d</p><p>Amusement warred with exasperation. \u201cStop what? Looking hot and sexy? Or driving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon . . . don\u2019t push me right now.\u201d</p><p>Resigned, I eased off the gas and pulled to a stop on the narrow shoulder. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>She got out of the car and went around the hood. I stepped out, giving her a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving,\u201d she announced when she was standing in front of me. \u201cAt least until we get to the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>I knew next to nothing about relationships, but it was a no-brainer to make concessions when your woman was mad at you. Especially when you entertained hopes of getting laid in a few hours, which I most definitely was. After spending the weekend with friends and Ireland, I was feeling a renewed need to show my wife just how much I appreciated her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I raked her with a glance, admiring how pretty she looked in a strappy white sundress. The evening was hot and muggy, but she looked airy and fresh. I wanted to strip off my clothes and press up against her, cool off a little before heating things up.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m a ticking time bomb ready to go off!\u201d Her arms crossed. \u201cI am not being irrational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel, that\u2019s not the look I\u2019m giving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to distract me with sex,\u201d she bit out, her jaw clenched. \u201cOr you won\u2019t get any for a week!\u201d</p><p>My arms crossed, too. \u201cWe\u2019ve already talked about issuing ultimatums like that. You can bitch at me all you like, Eva, but I\u2019ll have you when I want you. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind whether I want you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsks the wife who gets wet watching me drive a damn car,\u201d I drawled.</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cI may just leave you here on the side of the road.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, I wasn\u2019t navigating the situation well. So I switched tactics, taking the offensive position.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me everything,\u201d I countered. \u201cWhat about Kline? Has he completely stopped communicating with you since San Diego?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been holding back the question all weekend, wondering how Kline was going to handle Eva.</p><p>I was torn about how I wanted him to proceed. If he approached her about the tape he no longer possessed, it would hurt her but also drive her closer to me. If he walked away for her sake, it would betray deeper feelings for her than I was comfortable with. I hated that he wanted her, but I feared he might actually love her.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cOh my God. Have you been looking at my phone again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My reply was swift and decisive. \u201cI know how you feel about that.\u201d</p><p>I followed her every move, knew where she was and who she was with at every moment of the day, but she\u2019d set a hard limit with her cell phone and I honored it, even though it drove me crazy.</p><p>Eva studied me a minute but must have seen the truth on my face. \u201cYes, Brett has sent me a few texts. I was going to talk to you about it, so don\u2019t even try to say it\u2019s the same thing. I totally intended to tell you. You had absolutely no intention of telling me.\u201d</p><p>A car rushed by on the road, turning my concern toward her safety. \u201cGet in and drive. We\u2019ll talk in the car.\u201d</p><p>I waited until she climbed into the seat, and then I shut the door behind her. By the time I settled in the passenger side, she\u2019d adjusted the mirrors and seat to suit her and put the car in gear.</p><p>The minute she was fully merged in the lane, she started in on me again. I was vaguely aware of her speaking, my attention more focused on the way she handled the Bentley. She drove fast and with confidence, her grip light and easy on the wheel. She kept her gaze on the road, but I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off her. My California girl. On an open road, she was fully in her element.</p><p>I found myself pleasantly aroused by watching Eva handle the powerful SUV. Or maybe it was that she was chastising me, challenging me.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot really, angel. And before you get more riled, it\u2019s entirely your fault. You\u2019re sitting there looking hot and sexy, and I\u2019m distracted.\u201d</p><p>Her hand whipped out and smacked my thigh. \u201cSeriously? Stop cracking jokes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Eva . . . you want me to share, so you can support me. I get it. I\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hard enough apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to share things that aggravate you unnecessarily. There\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to be straight with each other, Gideon. Not just occasionally, but all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I don\u2019t expect the same from you. For example, feel free to keep all the unflattering comments your father and Cary make about me to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. She chewed on that for a bit, then, \u201cUsing that logic, wouldn\u2019t it be okay for me to not say anything about Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Kline impacts our relationship. My mother does not.\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right about this,\u201d I said evenly.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me that your mom talking crap about me doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it. That said, it doesn\u2019t change how I feel about you or her. And telling you won\u2019t change your feelings about her, either. Since the result is the same either way, I choose the path of least disruption.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking like a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so.\u201d I reached over and brushed the hair off her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t let her cause trouble between us, angel. She\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Eva glanced at me. \u201cYou\u2019re pretending that what your mom says and does has no effect on you, but I know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>I debated denying it, just to shut down the topic, but my wife saw everything I\u2019d rather hide. \u201cI don\u2019t let it affect me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it does.

Through the misted glass of my bathroom shower, I watched the rivulets of soapy water run down the hard ridges of his abdomen and the length of his strong legs. His body was a work of art, a machine he kept in prime shape. I loved it. Loved looking at it, touching it, tasting it.</p><p>Reaching out, he swiped a hand through the condensation, revealing that breathtaking face. One darkly winged brow arched in silent query.</p><p>\u201cJust enjoying the show,\u201d I explained. The scent of his soap teased senses that had become trained to recognize the fragrance as belonging to my mate. The man who stirred and pleasured my body to delirium.</p> <p>I licked my lips when he casually stroked the heavy length of his cock. He\u2019d once told me he used to masturbate every time he took a shower, a release he had considered as routine as brushing his teeth. I could see why, knowing how powerful his sexual appetite was. I would never forget the way he\u2019d looked when he had jacked off in the shower for me, so virile and potent and hungry for orgasm.</p><p>Since he\u2019d met me, he didn\u2019t pleasure himself anymore. Not because he couldn\u2019t still satisfy me if he did, and not because I took care of him enough to make the effort redundant. For both of us, being ready for sex with each other was never a problem, because the hunger we felt was deeper than physical.</p><p>Gideon teased me by saying he saved himself to satisfy my insatiability, but I saw the self-restraint for what it was\u2014he gave me the right to his pleasure. It was mine and mine alone. He had none without me, which was a tremendous gift. Especially in light of his past, when sexual release had been used as a weapon against him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interactive exhibition,\u201d he said, his eyes warm with amusement. \u201cJoin me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an animal.\u201d My thighs were wet with his semen beneath my robe, since I was the lucky girl who woke up to his desire.</p><p>\u201cOnly for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, right answer.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. His cock lengthened. \u201cYou should reward me.\u201d</p> <p>I moved away from the threshold and stepped closer. \u201cHow would you suggest I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny way you like.\u201d</p><p>That was a gift, too. Gideon rarely relinquished control, and then only to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have enough time to do you justice, ace. I\u2019d hate to cut things short when they\u2019re just getting interesting.\u201d I set my hand on the glass. \u201cHow about we revisit after my workout tonight? You, me, and whatever I want to do to you?\u201d</p><p>He shifted and faced me head on, his hand lifting to press against mine through the glass. His gaze slid over my face in a heated caress that was damn near tangible. His face was impassive, a strikingly handsome mask that revealed nothing. But his eyes . . . those stunning blue depths . . . they exposed tenderness and love and vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all yours, angel,\u201d he said, his words so quiet I saw them more than heard them.</p><p>I pressed a kiss to the cool glass. \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>NEW week. Same ultrafocused Gideon. He started working as soon as the Bentley pulled away from the curb, his fingers flying across the keyboard built into a dropdown tray table. I watched him, finding his intense concentration and confidence extremely sexy. I was married to a powerful, driven man, and watching him flex that ambition was a major turn-on.</p><p>I was so into watching him that I jumped when my smartphone vibrated in my purse against my hip.</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d I muttered, digging it out.</p><p>Brett\u2019s name and photo appeared on the lock screen. Knowing I needed to deal with him at some point if I expected him to stop calling, I answered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I answered cautiously.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d The timbre of Brett\u2019s now-famous voice hit me as forcefully as it always had, but not in the same way. I loved the way he sang, but that love wasn\u2019t intimate anymore. It wasn\u2019t personal. I admired him the way I did a dozen other singers. \u201cDamn it, I\u2019ve been trying to reach you for a week!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been busy. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better. I need to see you.\u201d</p><p>My brows rose. \u201cWhen are you coming to town?\u201d</p><p>He laughed harshly, a humorless sound that rubbed me the wrong way. \u201cIncredible. Listen, I don\u2019t want to get into it on the phone. Can we get together today? We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in New York? I thought you were on tour . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s rapid-fire typing didn\u2019t slow and he didn\u2019t look at me, but I could feel his energy shift. He was paying attention, and he knew who was on the line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on when I see you,\u201d Brett said.</p><p>I frowned out the window as we idled at a light, my gaze on the flood of pedestrians crossing the street. New York was teeming with life and frenetic energy, gearing up to do world-changing business. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to work. What\u2019s going on, Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can meet you for lunch. Or after you get off for the day.\u201d</p><p>I debated saying no, but the determination in his tone gave me pause. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, I set my hand on Gideon\u2019s thigh. The toned muscle was hard beneath my palm, even though he was at rest. The tailored suits polished his form into civility, but I knew the truth about the vigorously fit body that was only hinted at underneath. \u201cI can see you at lunch, if we stick close to the Crossfire Building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. What time should I be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little before noon would be best. I\u2019ll meet you in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I dropped the phone back into my purse. Gideon\u2019s hand captured mine. I glanced at him, but he was reading a lengthy e-mail, his head bent slightly so that the ends of his hair brushed his sculpted jaw.</p><p>The warmth of his touch soaked into me. I looked down at the band he wore on his finger, the one that told the world he belonged to me.</p><p>Did his business associates pay attention to his hands? They weren\u2019t those of a man who pushed paper and tapped on keyboards all day. They were the hands of a fighter, a warrior who practiced mixed martial arts and pounded out his aggression with both boxing bags and sparring partners.</p><p>Kicking off my shoes, I curled my legs under me and leaned into Gideon\u2019s side, setting my other hand on top of his. I ran my splayed fingers between his knuckles and fingers, forward and back, carefully resting my head against his shoulder so that I didn\u2019t mess up his pristine black jacket with my makeup.</p><p>I breathed him in, feeling the effect of him\u2014his nearness, his support\u2014permeate my being. The smell of his soap was muted now, the naturally seductive scent of his skin altering the fragrance into something richer and more delicious.</p><p>When I was restless, he settled me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for him,\u201d I whispered, needing him to know that. \u201cI\u2019m too filled with you.\u201d</p><p>His chest expanded abruptly, his sharp inhalation audible. He pushed the tray table up and away, then patted his lap in invitation. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I crawled into his lap, sighing happily when he shifted me into a spot that felt made for me. Every peaceful moment we had with each other was treasured. Gideon deserved the respite, and I longed to be that for him.</p><p>His lips touched my forehead. \u201cYou okay, angel mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in your arms. Life doesn\u2019t get better than this.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I spotted three paparazzi outside the Crossfire when we arrived.</p><p>With a hand at the small of my back, Gideon ushered me through the entrance ahead of him, escorting me quickly but unhurriedly into the cool lobby.</p><p>\u201cVultures,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be helped that we\u2019re such a photogenic couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a humble man, Gideon Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me look good, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>We stepped into the elevator with a few other people and he took the rear corner, hooking me to him with an arm around my waist, his hand pressed flat against my belly, his chest warm and hard against my back.</p><p>I savored those few minutes with him, refusing to think about work or Brett until we parted on the twentieth floor.</p><p>Megumi was already at her desk when I approached the glass security doors, and the sight of her made me smile. She\u2019d trimmed her hair since I\u2019d seen her Friday night and polished her nails a bright red. It was good to see the small signs that she was reclaiming her spirit.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d she greeted me after buzzing me in, pushing to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cThanks. How\u2019d it go with Gideon\u2019s sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. She\u2019s a lot of fun. It makes me melt seeing Gideon with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes me melt, period. You lucky bitch. Anyway, I put a call through to your line earlier. They wanted to leave a message.\u201d</p><p>I shifted on my feet, thinking of Brett. \u201cWas it a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, I\u2019ll go check it out, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I headed back to my desk and got settled in, my gaze coming to rest on the collage of photos of Gideon and me. I still needed to talk to him about Crossroads. There hadn\u2019t been a good time over the weekend. We\u2019d had enough on our plates having Ireland over.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t slept Saturday night. I\u2019d hoped he would but hadn\u2019t really expected him to. It was hard for me, thinking of his inner struggle, his worry and fear. He carried shame, too, and an inherent belief that he was broken. Damaged goods.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see in himself what I saw\u2014a generous soul who wanted so much to belong to something greater than himself. He didn\u2019t recognize what a miracle he was. When he didn\u2019t know what to do in a given situation, he let instinct and his heart take over. Despite all he\u2019d been through, he had such an amazing capacity to feel and to love.</p><p>He\u2019d saved me, in so many ways. I was going to do whatever needed to be done to save him, too.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I listened to my messages. When Mark came in, I stood, and met him with a grin and bouncing anticipation.</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gal from LanCorp called this morning. They want to meet with us sometime this week to talk a bit more about what they\u2019re hoping to achieve with the launch of the PhazeOne system.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes took on a familiar sparkle. He\u2019d become a happier man overall since he and Steven had become engaged, but there was a whole different energy to him when he was eager about a new account. \u201cYou and me, kid, we\u2019re going places.\u201d</p><p>I hopped a little on my feet. \u201cYeah. You\u2019ve got this. Once they meet with you in person, you\u2019ll have them eating out of your hand.\u201d</p><p>Mark laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re good for my confidence.\u201d</p><p>I winked at him. \u201cI\u2019m good for you, period.\u201d</p><p>We spent the morning working on the PhazeOne RFP, putting together comps to better grasp how we might position the new gaming system against its competition. I had a momentary pause when I realized how much buzz surrounded the upcoming release of the next-generation GenTen console\u2014which happened to be a product of Cross Industries, making it PhazeOne\u2019s primary rival in the marketplace.</p><p>Pointing the situation out to Mark, I asked, \u201cIs it going to be a problem? I mean, could LanCorp possibly see a conflict of interest with me working for you on this?\u201d</p><p>He straightened in his chair, leaning back. He\u2019d shucked his coat earlier but remained smartly attired in a white dress shirt, bright yellow tie, and navy slacks. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be an issue, no. If our proposed positioning wins out over the other RFPs they\u2019re collecting, the fact that you\u2019re engaged to Gideon Cross isn\u2019t going to make a damn bit of difference. They\u2019re going to make their decision based on our ability to deliver their vision.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wanted to feel relieved, but I didn\u2019t. If we were awarded the PhazeOne campaign, I\u2019d be helping one of Gideon\u2019s competitors steal some of his market share. That really bothered me. Gideon worked so hard and had overcome so much to lift the Cross name up from infamy to a level where it inspired awe, respect, and a healthy amount of fear. I never wanted to set him back, in anything.</p><p>I\u2019d thought I would have a little more time before I was forced to make a choice. And I couldn\u2019t help feeling like the choice to be made was between my independence and my love for my husband.</p><p>The dilemma niggled at me all morning, chipping away at the excitement I felt over the RFP. Then the hours crept toward noon and Brett took over my thoughts.</p><p>It was time to take responsibility for the mess I\u2019d made. I had opened the door to Brett, and then I\u2019d kept it open because I couldn\u2019t get my head on straight. It was my job now to fix the problem before it impacted my marriage any more than it already had.</p> <p>I headed down to the lobby at five minutes to noon, having asked permission from Mark to leave a little early. Brett was already waiting for me, standing near the entrance with his hands shoved into his jeans pockets. He wore a plain white T-shirt and sandals, with sunglasses propped atop his head.</p><p>My stride faltered a little. Not just because he was hot, which was undeniable, but because he looked so out of place in the Crossfire. When he\u2019d met me here before the video launch in Times Square, we had rendezvoused outside. Now, he was in the building, occupying a spot too near to where I\u2019d first run into Gideon.</p><p>The differences between the two men were stark and didn\u2019t have anything to do with clothing or money.</p><p>Brett\u2019s mouth curved when he saw me, his body straightening, shifting in that way men moved when their sexual interest was piqued. Other men, but not Gideon. When I\u2019d first met my husband, his body, his voice, gave nothing away. Only his eyes had betrayed his attraction, and only for an instant.</p><p>It was later I realized what had happened in that moment.</p> <p>Gideon had claimed me . . . and given himself to me in return. With a single look. He\u2019d recognized me the moment he saw me. It took me longer to understand what we were to each other. What we were meant to be.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but contrast the possessive, tender way Gideon looked at me against the earthier, lustful way Brett raked me from head to toe.</p><p>It seemed so obvious suddenly, that Brett had never really thought of me as his. Not the way Gideon did. Brett had wanted me, still did, but even when he\u2019d had me, he hadn\u2019t asserted any ownership and he certainly hadn\u2019t ever given anything real of himself to me.</p><p>Gideon. My head tilted back, my gaze searching for and finding one of the many black domes in the ceiling that hid the security cameras. My hand went to my heart, pressing over it. I knew he probably wasn\u2019t looking. I knew he\u2019d have to deliberately access the feed in order to see me and that he was far too busy with work to think of it, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d</p><p>My hand dropped to my side. I looked at Brett as he approached me with the easy prowl of a man who knew his appeal and was confident of his chances.</p> <p>The lobby was swarming with people flowing around us in steady streams, as one would expect in a midtown skyscraper. When his arms lifted as if to embrace me, I stepped back and held out my left hand instead, just as I had done when we last met in San Diego. I would never again cause Gideon to feel the pain I\u2019d inflicted when he saw me kissing Brett.</p><p>Brett\u2019s brows lifted and the heat in his eyes cooled. \u201cReally? Is this where we\u2019re at now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cHugging each other isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the women he\u2019s tapped all over the tabloids? That\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I chided. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t always believe what the press feeds you.\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. He shoved his hands back in his pockets. \u201cYou can believe what they say about how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>My stomach fluttered. \u201cI think you believe it.\u201d</p><p>Which made me a little sad. He didn\u2019t know what Gideon and I had, because he\u2019d never had it. I hoped he would someday. Brett wasn\u2019t a bad guy. He just wasn\u2019t meant to be my guy.</p> <p>Cursing under his breath, Brett turned and gestured toward the exit. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I was torn. I wanted privacy, too, but I also wanted to stay where there were witnesses who could reassure Gideon. In any case, we couldn\u2019t exactly have a picnic in the Crossfire lobby.</p><p>Reluctantly, I fell into step beside him. \u201cI had some sandwiches delivered a little bit ago. Figured that would give us more time to talk.\u201d</p><p>Brett nodded grimly and held out his hand for the bag I was carrying.</p><p>I took him to Bryant Park, weaving beside him through the frenetic lunchtime crowds on the sidewalks. Taxis and private cars honked insistently at the streams of pedestrians too time-strapped to obey the signals. Heat shimmered off the asphalt, the sun high enough in the sky to spear down between the towering skyscrapers. An NYPD squad car hit its siren, the piercing robotic chirps and rumbles doing little to expedite the cruiser\u2019s movement through the clogged street.</p><p>It was Manhattan on an average day and I loved it, but I could tell Brett was frustrated by the intricate dance required to get through the city. The shifting of shoulders and hips to let people pass, the quick inhales to squeeze by too-big bags or too-slow pedestrians, the swift-footedness needed to avoid the abrupt appearance of new bodies filing out of the many doorways that lined the sidewalks. Life as usual in NYC, but I remembered how overwhelming it felt when you weren\u2019t used to so many people occupying relatively little space.</p><p>Entering the park just behind the library, we found an unoccupied bistro table and chairs in the shade near the carousel and settled in. Brett pulled out the sandwiches, chips, and bottled water I\u2019d ordered, but neither of us started eating. I scouted our surroundings instead, aware that we could be photographed.</p><p>I\u2019d considered that when I chose the location, but the alternative was a noisy, crowded restaurant. I was hyperconscious of my body language, trying to ensure that nothing could be misconstrued. The world at large could think we were friends. My husband would know, in every way I could show him, that Brett and I had actually said good-bye.</p><p>\u201cYou got the wrong impression in San Diego,\u201d Brett said abruptly, his eyes shielded behind his shades. \u201cBrittany isn\u2019t a serious thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business, Brett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you. Sometimes, she reminds me of you.\u201d</p><p>I winced, finding the comment anything but flattering. I lifted one hand and gestured helplessly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go back to you, Brett. Not after Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe makes me feel like he can\u2019t breathe without me. I couldn\u2019t settle for less.\u201d I didn\u2019t need to say that Brett had never made me feel like that. He knew.</p><p>He stared at his steepled fingertips, then straightened abruptly and dug his wallet out of his back pocket. He pulled a folded photograph out and set it on the table in front of me.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said tightly, \u201cand tell me we didn\u2019t have something real.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the photo and spread it open, frowning at the image. It was a candid shot of Brett and me, laughing together over something lost to memory. I recognized the interior of Pete\u2019s in the background. There was a crowd of blurred faces around us.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d I asked. There\u2019d been a time when I would\u2019ve given anything to have an unposed photo with Brett, believing that such an insubstantial thing would give me some kind of proof that I was more than a piece of ass.</p><p>\u201cSam took that after one of our sets.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened at the mention of Sam Yimara, abruptly reminded of the sex tape. I looked at Brett, my hands shaking so hard I had to put the photo down. \u201cDo you know about . . . ?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even finish the sentence. Turned out, it wasn\u2019t necessary for me to.</p><p>Brett\u2019s jaw tensed, his forehead and upper lip beaded with sweat from the summer heat. He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I recoiled from the table, my mind filled with all the possibilities of what was captured on video. I had been desperate to win Brett\u2019s attention, with a complete lack of self-respect that shamed me now.</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He reached for me. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. Whatever Cross told you about the video, I promise it isn\u2019t bad. A little raw sometimes, but that\u2019s the way it was between us.\u201d</p><p>No . . . Raw was what I had with Gideon. What I\u2019d had with Brett was something much darker and unhealthy.</p><p>I clasped my trembling hands together. \u201cHow many people have seen it? Have you shown it to\u2014 Has the band watched it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to answer; I saw it on his face.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d I felt sick. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Brett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want\u2014\u201d Shoving up his sunglasses, he rubbed at his eyes. \u201cHell. I want you. I want us to be together. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re over yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never got started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s my fault. I want you to give me a chance to fix it.\u201d</p><p>I gaped. \u201cI\u2019m married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no good, Eva. You don\u2019t know him like you think you do.\u201d</p><p>My legs quivered with the urge to get up and leave. \u201cI know he\u2019d never show footage of us to anyone! He respects me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole point was to document the rise of the band, Eva. We had to sort through it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve watched it alone first,\u201d I said tightly, horribly aware of the people sitting not too far away. \u201cYou could\u2019ve cut us out before the others saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones Sam got on video. The other guys had stuff, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I watched as he shifted restlessly. Suspicion bloomed. \u201cAnd there were other girls with you,\u201d I guessed, my nausea worsening. \u201cWhat did it matter when I was just one of many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt mattered.\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cIt was different with you, Eva. I was different with you. I was just too young and full of myself to appreciate it at the time. You need to see, Eva. Then you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head violently. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see it. Ever. Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>That was a lie. What was in the video? How bad was it?</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it.\u201d He yanked off his shades, throwing them on the table. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to talk about the fucking video.\u201d</p><p>But there was a defensiveness to his posture that made me doubt him. His shoulders were high and tight, his mouth a hard line.</p><p>Whatever Cross told you . . .</p><p>He knew Gideon was aware of the tape. He had to know Gideon was fighting to keep it buried. Sam would\u2019ve told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked again. \u201cWhat was so damned urgent you had to come out to New York?\u201d</p><p>I waited for him to answer, my heart pounding. It was hot as hell and humid, but my skin felt chilled and clammy. He couldn\u2019t tell me he loved me, not after I\u2019d caught him with Brittany. He couldn\u2019t warn me away from Gideon; I was already married. Brett was in Manhattan midtour, something the band had to agree with. And Vidal. Why would they do that? What would they get out of interrupting their schedule?</p><p>When Brett just sat there, his jaw working, I stood and turned blindly away, hurrying across the grass toward the nearest gate in the wrought-iron fence.</p><p>He called after me, but I kept my head down, achingly aware of the number of people in the park whose heads turned in my direction. I was making a scene, but I couldn\u2019t stop. I left my bag behind and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Get away. Get somewhere safe. Get to Gideon.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my husband\u2019s voice made me stumble. I turned my head. He rose from a chair near the piano by Bryant Park Grill. Cool and elegant, seemingly impervious to the sultry heat.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>The concern in his eyes, the gentle way he enfolded me in a hug, gave me strength. He\u2019d known this meeting with Brett wouldn\u2019t go well. That I would be upset and needy. That I would need him.</p><p>And he was there. I didn\u2019t know how, and I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>My fingers dug into his back, practically clawing at him.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His lips brushed against my ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Ra\u00fal appeared beside us with my bag in hand, his stance conveying a protectiveness that added to the shield Gideon\u2019s body gave me. The riotous panic inside me began to ease. I wasn\u2019t freefalling anymore. Gideon was my net, always prepared to catch me.</p><p>He led me down the steps to where the Bentley waited, with Angus standing ready to open the back door. I slid inside and Gideon joined me, his arm wrapping around me when I curled into him.</p><p>We were right back to where we\u2019d started that morning. But in a matter of hours, everything had changed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this,\u201d he murmured. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my nose to his throat. \u201cThey want to use the footage, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t. No one will.\u201d There was a razor-sharp edge to his words.</p><p>I believed him. And I loved him more than I ever thought possible.</p> <p>\u2014</p><p>WHAT an afternoon. I avoided thinking about Brett by working hard on game console comps, including GenTen; my mind was firmly on Gideon when five o\u2019clock rolled around.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just PhazeOne that worried me anymore. It was also me, the girl I\u2019d once been. The sex tape could do more damage to the Cross name than anything a rival company could do.</p><p>I texted Gideon. I hoped for a quick answer but didn\u2019t expect one. Are you in your office?</p><p>He replied almost instantly. Yes.</p> <p>Heading home, I typed back. Want to say bye first.</p><p>Come up.</p><p>I released the breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding. See you in ten.</p><p>Megumi was already gone when I passed reception, so I reached Gideon faster than I\u2019d planned on. His receptionist was still at her station, her long red hair hanging sleekly around her shoulders. She gave me a curt nod and I gave her a smile, unfazed.</p><p>Scott wasn\u2019t at his desk when I got back there, but Gideon was standing at his, his hands on the desktop as he perused documents spread out in front of him. Arash was seated in one of the chairs, his posture relaxed and easy as he spoke. Neither of them wore a coat, and both of them looked mighty fine.</p><p>Arash glanced at me as I came closer, and Gideon\u2019s head came up. My husband\u2019s eyes were so blue, the hue struck me even across the distance between us. His face remained austerely handsome, so classically Gideon, and yet his gaze softened at the sight of me. My mouth curved when he beckoned me with a crook of his finger.</p> <p>I entered his office and held out my hand to Arash when he stood. \u201cHey,\u201d I greeted him. \u201cYou keeping him out of trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he lets me,\u201d the lawyer replied, catching my hand and pulling me in for an air kiss on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Gideon said dryly, his arm sliding around my waist.</p><p>Arash laughed. \u201cThis new jealous streak of yours is vastly entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sense of humor is not,\u201d Gideon shot back.</p><p>I leaned into my husband, loving the feel of his hard body against mine. There was no give to him, no yielding. Except when he looked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting in thirty,\u201d Arash said, \u201cso I\u2019ll head out. Thanks for Friday night, Eva. I\u2019d love to do it again sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d I told him. \u201cFor sure.\u201d</p> <p>As he left the office, I turned to Gideon. \u201cCan I hug you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never have to ask.\u201d</p><p>My heart felt squeezed by the warm indulgence in his eyes. \u201cThe glass is clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them see,\u201d he murmured, wrapping his arms around me. He exhaled long and slow when I clung to him. \u201cTalk to me, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d Didn\u2019t want to think about the mess I\u2019d made of my life, which was now impacting the man I loved. \u201cI want to hear your voice. Say anything, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKline won\u2019t hurt you. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>My eyes squeezed shut. \u201cNot about him. Tell me about work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva . . .\u201d</p><p>I felt the tension in his body, the strain of concern and worry, so I explained. \u201cI just want to close my eyes for a minute and feel you. Smell you. Hear you. I need to just soak you in for a minute, and then I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>His hands rubbed up and down my back, his chin resting on the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019re going away. Soon. For at least a week, although I\u2019d prefer two. I was thinking we might go back to Crosswinds. Spend the time naked and lazy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never lazy. Especially when you\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when you\u2019re naked,\u201d he corrected, nuzzling me. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never had you that way for an entire week. You could wear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s possible, fiend. But I\u2019m willing to try my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be our honeymoon, per se. I want a month for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month!\u201d I pulled back and looked at him, my mood lifting. \u201cThe entire economy of New York could collapse if you\u2019re out of the game that long.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the side of my face, his thumb brushing over my brow. \u201cI think my highly capable team can manage a few weeks without me.\u201d</p><p>I caught his wrist and let a little of my anxiety out. \u201cI couldn\u2019t manage it. I need you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva.\u201d He lowered his head and pressed his lips to mine, his tongue teasing them open.</p><p>Gripping his nape in my hand, I held him still while I deepened the kiss. Fell into it. He pulled me closer, lifting me onto my tiptoes. His head tilted, tightening the seal until every breath was shared, every moan and whimper.</p><p>I gasped when we broke for air. \u201cWhen will you be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you want me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be when your day is done. You\u2019ve lost enough time over me today.\u201d I smoothed his perfectly placed tie. \u201cYou weren\u2019t just spying on me this afternoon. You knew my lunch with Brett was going to go south.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spying? Or the heading south?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a look. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me a hard time about being there for you. You would\u2019ve done the same had the situation been reversed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know what he wanted?\u201d Was the video\u2019s existence eating at him, too? What I\u2019d done and who I\u2019d been before?</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s getting pressure from Christopher, who\u2019s also putting pressure on the rest of the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? To get to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn part. You\u2019re not just some random hot blonde. You\u2019re Eva Tramell and you\u2019re news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should dye my hair. Get rid of the \u2018Golden.\u2019 How about red?\u201d I couldn\u2019t go brunette, not with Gideon\u2019s history of dark-haired women. It would kill me to look in the mirror every day.</p><p>His face shuttered, closed up like a steel trap even though nothing else about him gave away any tension. I got a tingle at the back of my neck, a prickling warning that something had shifted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like the idea?\u201d I prodded, abruptly reminded of a redhead from his past\u2014Dr. Anne Lucas.</p><p>\u201cI like you just the way you are. That said, if you want a change, I won\u2019t object. It\u2019s your body, your right. But don\u2019t do it just because of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you still want me?\u201d</p><p>The tightness around his mouth eased, the inflexibility on his face fading away nearly as swiftly as it had appeared. \u201cWould you still want me if I had red hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I tapped my chin with my finger, pretending to contemplate the change. \u201cMaybe we should stick with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Gideon kissed my forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s what I signed up for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also signed up for letting me have my way with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName the time and place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight o\u2019clock? Your apartment on the Upper West Side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur apartment.\u201d He kissed me softly. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cBY THE WAY, congratulations on your engagement.\u201d</p><p>My gaze shifted from the project engineer\u2019s face on my monitor to the photo of Eva blowing kisses. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I would much rather look at my wife. For an instant, I pictured Eva as she\u2019d been the night before, those plush lips wrapped around my cock. I had given her carte blanche with my body and all she\u2019d wanted was to suck me off. Again and again. And again. Christ. I had been thinking about the night we\u2019d had all day long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep you posted on the impact of the storm,\u201d he said, bringing my attention back to work. \u201cI appreciate you calling personally to check on us. The weather conditions may set us back a week or two, depending, but we\u2019ll open on time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a cushion. Take care of yourself and your crew first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I closed the chat window and checked my schedule, needing to know exactly how much time I had to prepare for my next meeting with the lead R and D team at PosIT.</p><p>Scott\u2019s voice projected from my phone\u2019s speaker. \u201cChristopher Vidal Sr. is on line one. It\u2019s his third call today. I\u2019ve already told him you\u2019ll get back to him when you can, but he\u2019s insistent. How do you want me to handle?\u201d</p><p>Calls from my stepfather never boded well, which meant delaying them ate into the time I had to fix whatever problem he needed to impose on me. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>I hit the speaker button. \u201cChris, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon. Listen, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you, but you and I need to talk. Would it be possible for us to meet today?\u201d</p><p>Prodded by the urgency in his voice, I picked up the receiver and took him off speaker. \u201cMy office or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your penthouse.\u201d</p><p>I sat back, surprised. \u201cI won\u2019t be home until close to nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everyone all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, everyone\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Vidal, then. We\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He laughed harshly. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Gideon. One of the best I know. I should\u2019ve told you that more often.\u201d</p><p>My gaze narrowed at the edge in his tone. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few minutes now. Just lay it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not now. I\u2019ll see you at nine.\u201d</p><p>He hung up. I sat for a long minute with the receiver in my hand. There was a knot in my gut, one that was cold and sharp.</p><p>I returned the receiver to its cradle and my attention to work, pulling up schematics and reviewing the packet Scott had placed on my desk earlier. Still, my mind raced.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t control what happened with my family, had never had any power there. I could only clean up the messes Christopher made and try to keep Vidal from going under. I drew the line, however, at using the footage of Eva. Nothing Chris could say would change that.</p><p>Time was racing toward the PosIT meeting when the message app popped up on my monitor and Eva\u2019s avatar appeared.</p><p>I can still taste you. Yummy.</p><p>A dry laugh escaped me. The knot I\u2019d been ignoring eased, then disappeared. She was my clean slate. My fresh start.</p><p>Soothed, I replied. The pleasure was mine.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019VE got a lead.\u201d</p><p>My head turned to find Ra\u00fal entering my office.</p><p>He came to my desk with brisk strides. \u201cI\u2019m still running through the guest list for that event you attended a couple weeks ago. I\u2019ve also been running twice-daily searches for photos. Got an alert on this one today. I secured a copy and made some zoom views.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the photos he slid across my desk. Picking them up, I examined them more closely, one by one. There was a redhead in the background. In each successive picture, she was brought closer to the fore. \u201cEmerald green dress, long red hair. This is the woman Eva saw.\u201d</p><p>It was also Anne Lucas. Something about the way she was standing, with her face averted, spurred a familiar sickness in my gut.</p><p>I looked up at Ra\u00fal. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t on the guest list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot officially, but she was on the red carpet, so I\u2019m thinking she had to have been someone\u2019s plus-one. I don\u2019t know who her escort was yet, but I\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>Restless, I stood, shoving my chair back. \u201cShe went after Eva. You need to keep her away from my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngus and I are developing new protocols for event security.\u201d</p><p>Turning, I retrieved my jacket from its hook. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if you need more men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d He scooped up the photos and started toward me. \u201cShe\u2019s at her office today,\u201d he said, accurately gauging my intention. \u201cWas still there when I headed up to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cEXCUSE me.\u201d The petite brunette behind the desk stood in a rush as I walked by. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there. Dr. Lucas is with a patient now.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the knob and opened the door, walking into Anne\u2019s office without breaking stride.</p><p>Her head snapped up, her green eyes widening the instant before her red mouth curved in a satisfied smile. The woman on the couch across from her blinked at me in confusion, swallowing whatever she\u2019d been about to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Dr. Lucas,\u201d the brunette said breathlessly. \u201cI tried to stop him.\u201d</p><p>Anne slithered to her feet, her eyes on me. \u201cAn impossible task, Michelle. Don\u2019t worry, you can go.\u201d</p><p>The receptionist backed out. Anne glanced at her patient. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to cut today\u2019s appointment short. I apologize for this incredibly rude interruption\u201d\u2014she glared at me\u2014\u201cand of course I won\u2019t charge you. Please talk to Michelle about rescheduling.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I waited in the open door as the flustered woman gathered her stuff, and then I moved aside as she stepped out.</p><p>\u201cI could\u2019ve called security,\u201d Anne said, leaning back against the front of her desk and crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cAfter going to all the trouble of luring me here? You wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Regardless, it\u2019s good to see you.\u201d She dropped her arms and gripped the edge of her desk in a deliberately provocative pose, exposing her bare thigh as the slit in her blue wrap dress slid open.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say the same.\u201d</p><p>Her smile tightened. \u201cBreak your toys, then throw them away. Does Eva know her days are numbered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>Unease dimmed her bright eyes and shook her smile. \u201cIs that a threat, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like for it to be.\u201d I stepped closer, watched her pupils dilate. She was becoming aroused and that revolted me as much as the smell of her perfume. \u201cMight make your game more interesting.\u201d</p> <p>She straightened and came toward me, her hips swaying, her red-soled black stilettos sinking into the plush carpet.</p><p>\u201cYou like to play, too, lover,\u201d she purred. \u201cTell me, have you tied up your pretty fianc\u00e9e? Flogged her into a frenzy? Shoved one of your extensive array of dildos into her ass, so that it fucked her while you pounded her pussy for hours? Does she know you, Gideon, the way I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds of women know me the way you do, Anne. Do you think you were special? The only thing memorable about you is your husband and how it eats at him that I\u2019ve had you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand swung up to slap me and I didn\u2019t stop her, taking the hit unflinchingly.</p><p>I wish what I\u2019d said were true, but I had been particularly depraved with her, seeing ghosts of her brother in the curve of her smile, her mannerisms\u2014</p><p>I caught her wrist when she made a grab for my cock. \u201cLeave Eva alone. I won\u2019t tell you twice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s the chink in your armor, you heartless piece of shit. You\u2019ve got ice in your veins, but she bleeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat, Anne?\u201d I asked, calmly tossing her words back to her.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She yanked free of my grip. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pay, and your billions won\u2019t cover the debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaising the stakes with a declaration of war? Are you that stupid? Or don\u2019t you care what this will cost you? Your career . . . your marriage . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>I moved toward the door, my stride leisurely even as fury burned through me. I\u2019d brought this down on Eva. I had to clean it up.</p><p>\u201cJust watch me, Gideon,\u201d she called after me. \u201cSee what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave it your way.\u201d I paused with my hand on the doorknob. \u201cYou\u2019ve started this, but make no mistake, the final move will be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p> <p>\u201cHAVE you had any nightmares since we last saw each other?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked, his demeanor laid back and quietly interested, the requisite tablet in his lap.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often would you say you have them?\u201d</p><p>I sat as comfortably as the easygoing doctor but was irritably restless inside. I had too much to deal with to waste an hour of my time. \u201cLately, once a week. Sometimes a little longer in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I met Eva.\u201d</p><p>He jotted something down with his stylus. \u201cYou\u2019re facing unfamiliar pressures as you work on your relationship with Eva, but the frequency of your nightmares is lessening\u2014at least for now. Do you have any thoughts as to why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were supposed to be explaining that to me.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t wave a magic wand and give you all the answers, Gideon. I can only help you sort through it.\u201d</p><p>I was tempted to wait for him to say more, make him do most of the talking. But the thought of Eva and her hopes that therapy was going to make some sort of difference goaded me to speak. I\u2019d promised to try, so I would. To a degree. \u201cThings are smoothing out for us. We\u2019re in sync more than we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that you\u2019re communicating better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re better at gauging the motives behind each other\u2019s actions. We understand each other more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour relationship has moved very quickly. You\u2019re not an impulsive man, but many would say marrying a woman you\u2019ve known such a short time\u2014and one you admit you\u2019re still getting to know\u2014is extremely impulsive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a question there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn observation.\u201d He waited a moment, but when I didn\u2019t say anything, he went on. \u201cIt can be difficult for spouses of individuals with Eva\u2019s history. Her commitment to therapy has helped both of you; however, it\u2019s likely she\u2019ll continue to change in ways you may not expect. It will be stressful for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no picnic myself,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a survivor of a different sort. Have you ever felt that your nightmares were aggravated by stress?\u201d</p><p>The question irritated me. \u201cWhat does it matter? They happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel there are changes that can be made to lessen their impact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got married. That\u2019s a major life change, wouldn\u2019t you say, Doctor? I think that\u2019s enough for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy must there be a limit? You\u2019re a young man, Gideon. You have a variety of options available to you. Change doesn\u2019t have to be something avoided. What\u2019s the harm in trying something new? If it doesn\u2019t work out, you always have the option to go back to what you were doing before.\u201d</p><p>I found that wryly amusing. \u201cSometimes, you can\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try a simple change now,\u201d Dr. Petersen said, setting his tablet aside. \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>I found myself standing when he did, not wanting to be seated while he towered above me. We stood face-to-face with the coffee table between us. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He gestured toward the door. \u201cMy office may not be the best place for us to talk. You\u2019re a man used to being in charge. In here, I am. So we\u2019ll level the playing field and hit the hallway for a bit. It\u2019s a public space, but most of the individuals who work in this building have gone home.\u201d</p><p>I exited his office before him, watching as he locked both his inner and outer office doors before joining me.</p><p>\u201cAh, well. This is certainly different,\u201d he said, his mouth curving wryly. \u201cKnocks me off my stride a bit.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and started walking.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for the rest of the evening?\u201d he asked, falling into step beside me.</p><p>\u201cAn hour with my trainer.\u201d And then I said more. \u201cMy stepfather is coming over later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo spend time with you and Eva? Are you close to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, to both.\u201d I stared straight ahead. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s the only reason he ever calls me.\u201d</p><p>I sensed his gaze on my profile. \u201cDo you wish that were different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dislike him.\u201d I was going to leave it at that, but again I thought of Eva. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know each other very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could change that.\u201d</p><p>I huffed out a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re really pushing that angle tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t have an angle.\u201d He stopped, forcing me to stop, too.</p><p>Tipping his chin up, he eyed the ceiling, clearly thinking. \u201cWhen you\u2019re considering an acquisition or exploring a new avenue of doing business, you bring in people to advise you, right? Experts in their respective fields?\u201d He looked at me again, smiling. \u201cYou could think of me the same way, as an expert consultant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour past.\u201d He resumed walking. \u201cI help you with that, you can figure out the rest of your life yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cGET your head in the game, Cross.\u201d</p><p>My gaze narrowed. Across the mat, James Cho hopped on his bare feet, taunting me. He grinned evilly, knowing the unspoken challenge would spur me on. Half a foot shorter than me and lighter by at least thirty pounds, the former MMA champion was lethally quick and had the belt to prove it.</p><p>Rolling my shoulders back, I adjusted my stance. My fists came up, closing the opening that had allowed his last punch to connect with my torso.</p><p>\u201cMake it worth my while, Cho,\u201d I fired back, irritated that he was right. My brain was still back in Dr. Petersen\u2019s office. A switch had been thrown tonight and I couldn\u2019t get a handle on what it was or what it meant.</p><p>James and I circled, feinting and striking out, neither of us scoring a hit. As always, it was just the two of us in the dojo. The driving beat of taiko drums rumbled in the background from speakers cleverly hidden in the floor-to-ceiling bamboo paneling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still holding back,\u201d he said. \u201cFalling in love turn you into a pussy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish. Only way you\u2019d beat me.\u201d</p><p>James laughed, then came at me with a roundhouse kick. I dropped low and swept him, taking him down. He scissored his legs with lightning speed, taking me down with him.</p><p>We hopped back up. Squared off again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting my time,\u201d he snapped, his fist lashing out.</p><p>I ducked to the side. My left fist shot out, grazing his side. His fist hit my ribs straight on.</p><p>\u201cNo one piss you off today?\u201d He came at me in a rush, giving me no option to do anything but defend myself.</p><p>I growled. Rage was simmering in the back of my mind, tucked away until I had the time and attention to deal with it.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I see that fire in your eyes, Cross. Let it out, man. Bring it on.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s the chink in your armor . . .</p><p>I lashed out with a left/right combo, driving James back a step.</p><p>\u201cThat all you got?\u201d he jeered.</p><p>I feigned a kick and then threw out a punch, snapping his head back.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah,\u201d he gasped, flexing his arms, getting pumped. \u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>She bleeds . . .</p><p>Snarling, I lunged forward.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>REFRESHED from a shower, I had barely finished dressing by pulling a T-shirt over my head when my smartphone started ringing. I picked it up off the bed where I\u2019d left it and answered.</p><p>\u201cA couple things,\u201d Ra\u00fal said after greeting me, the background noise of a crowd and music quickly fading, then disappearing completely. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that Benjamin Clancy is still keeping an eye on Mrs. Cross. Not constantly, but consistently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAre you good with that? Or should I talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him.\u201d Clancy and I were due for a chat. It had been on my list, but I would move it up.</p><p>\u201cAlso\u2014and you may know this already\u2014Mrs. Cross had lunch with Ryan Landon and some of his executives today.\u201d</p><p>I felt that terrible quiet settle over me. Landon. Fuck.</p><p>He\u2019d slid in somewhere I hadn\u2019t been watching.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ra\u00fal. I\u2019ll need a private number for Eva\u2019s boss, Mark Garrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text it to you when I have it.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, I shoved the phone in my pocket, barely resisting the urge to throw it at the wall instead.</p><p>Arash had warned me about Landon and I\u2019d brushed his concerns off. I\u2019d been focused on my life, my wife, and while Landon had a wife of his own, his primary focus had always been me.</p><p>The ringing of the penthouse phone jolted me. I went to the receiver on the nightstand and answered with an impatient, \u201cCross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross. It\u2019s Edwin at the front desk. Mr. Vidal is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. My grip tightened on the receiver. \u201cSend him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Will do.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing my socks and shoes, I carried them out to the living room and pulled them on. As soon as Chris left, I was heading home to Eva. I wanted to open a bottle of wine, find one of the older movies she knew by heart, and just listen to her recite the corny lines of dialogue. No one could make me laugh like she did.</p><p>I heard the elevator car arrive and pushed to my feet, running a hand through my damp hair. I was tense and despised the weakness.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Chris paused on the threshold of the foyer, looking grim and worn, which he so rarely did and only then because of my brother. \u201cIs Eva here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at her place. I\u2019m heading over there when you leave.\u201d</p><p>He gave a jerky nod, his jaw working but nothing coming out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d I said, gesturing at the wingback chair by the coffee table. \u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d</p><p>God knew I needed one myself after the day I\u2019d had so far.</p><p>He stepped wearily into my living room. \u201cAnything strong would be great.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d I went to the kitchen and poured us both a glass of Armagnac. As I was setting the decanter down, my phone vibrated in my pocket. Pulling it out, I saw a message from Eva.</p><p>It was a selfie of her bare leg glistening with water and draped over the rim of her bathtub with candles in the background. Join me?</p><p>I swiftly revised my plans for the evening. She\u2019d been sending me provocative texts all day. I was more than happy to both satisfy and reward her.</p><p>I saved the photo and typed back. Wish I could. Promise to make you wet again when I get there.</p> <p>Tucking my phone away, I turned and found Chris joining me at the island. I slid a tumbler over to him and took a sip from mine. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Chris?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, both of his hands wrapping around the crystal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to reshoot the \u2018Golden\u2019 video.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d That was an unnecessary expense, something Chris wisely avoided as a rule.</p><p>\u201cI overheard Kline and Christopher arguing in the offices yesterday,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cand got the story. Kline wants a redo and I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I leaned back against the counter, my jaw set. Apparently, Brett Kline had some serious feelings for Eva after all. I wasn\u2019t okay with that. Not even close.</p> <p>\u201cYour brother will get over it.\u201d</p><p>I doubted that, but it would do no good to say so.</p><p>But Chris read what I didn\u2019t say and gave a nod. \u201cI know the video has caused stress for you and Eva. I should\u2019ve been paying more attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you being flexible about it.\u201d</p><p>He stared into his glass and then took a long drink, nearly downing the contents in a single swallow. \u201cI\u2019ve left your mother.\u201d</p><p>I took a quick, deep breath, grasping that the reason for his visit had nothing to do with work. \u201cIreland told me you two had a fight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I hate that Ireland had to hear it.\u201d He looked at me, and I saw the knowledge in his eyes. The horror. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Gideon. I swear to God, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>My heart jerked in my chest, then began to pound. My mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, went to see Terrence Lucas.\u201d Chris\u2019s voice grew hoarse. \u201cBarged into his office. He denied it, the lying son of a bitch, but I could see it on his face.\u201d</p><p>The brandy sloshed in my glass. I set it down carefully, feeling the floor shift under my feet. Eva had confronted Lucas, but Chris . . . ?</p><p>\u201cI decked him, knocked him out cold, but God . . . I wanted to take one of those awards on his shelves and bash his head in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d The word broke from my throat like slivers of glass.</p><p>\u201cAnd the asshole who did . . . That asshole is dead. I can\u2019t get to him. Goddamn it.\u201d Chris dropped the tumbler onto the granite with a thud, but it was the sob that tore out of him that nearly shattered me. \u201cHell, Gideon. It was my job to protect you. And I failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I pushed off the counter, my hands clenching. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking look at me like that!\u201d</p> <p>He trembled visibly, but didn\u2019t back down. \u201cI had to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His wrinkled dress shirt was in my fists, his feet dangling above the floor. \u201cStop talking. Now!\u201d</p><p>Tears slipped down his face. \u201cI love you like my own. Always have.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him away. Turned my back to him when he stumbled and hit the wall. I left, crossing the living room without seeing it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not expecting your forgiveness,\u201d he called after me, tears clogging his words. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve it. But you need to hear that I would\u2019ve ripped him apart with my bare hands if I\u2019d known.\u201d</p><p>I rounded on him, feeling the sickness clawing up from my gut and burning my throat. \u201cWhat the fuck do you want?\u201d</p><p>Chris pulled his shoulders back. He faced me with reddened eyes and wet cheeks, shaking but too stupid to run. \u201cI want you to know that you\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>Alone. Yes. Far away from the pity and guilt and pain staring out at me through his tears. \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he headed toward the foyer. I stood immobile, my chest heaving, my eyes burning. Words backed up in my throat; violence pounded in the painful clench of my fists.</p><p>He stopped before he left the room, facing me. \u201cI\u2019m glad you told Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about her.\u201d I couldn\u2019t bear to even think of her. Not now, when I was so close to losing it.</p><p>He left.</p><p>The weight of the day crashed onto my shoulders, dropping me to my knees.</p><p>I broke.</p><p>14</p><p>I WAS DREAMING of a private beach and naked Gideon when I was jerked awake by the sound of my phone ringing. Rolling to my side, I thrust my arm out and smacked around on the top of my nightstand, trying to find my smartphone in the dark. My fingers brushed against the familiar shape and I grabbed it, sitting up.</p><p>Ireland\u2019s face lit up my screen. I frowned and glanced at the space beside me in the bed. Gideon wasn\u2019t home. Of course, he could\u2019ve found me sleeping and gone next door to go to bed . . .</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answered, noting that the time on the cable box said it was after eleven o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cEva. It\u2019s Chris Vidal. I\u2019m sorry to call so late, but I\u2019m worried about Gideon. Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped. \u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s wrong with Gideon?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to him tonight?\u201d</p><p>I slid out of bed and turned on the lamp. \u201cNo. I fell asleep. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He cursed with an intensity that made the hairs rise on my arms. \u201cI met with him earlier about . . . the things you told me. He didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I spun around blindly. Something to wear. I needed something to put on over the racy teddy I\u2019d planned to seduce Gideon with.</p><p>\u201cYou have to find him, Eva,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cHe needs you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d I tossed the phone on my bed and yanked a wool trench coat out of my closet before racing out of my room. I grabbed the keys to the next-door apartment from my purse and ran down the hall. Fumbling with the deadbolt, I took too long to open the door.</p><p>The place was as shadowy and silent as a tomb, the rooms empty.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I cried into the darkness, feeling the scratch of panicked tears in my throat.</p><p>I ended up back in my apartment, my fingers trembling as I opened the app on my smartphone that would track his.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take it well.</p><p>God. Of course, he didn\u2019t. He hadn\u2019t taken it well when I\u2019d told Chris initially. Gideon had been furious. Aggressive. He\u2019d had a horrible nightmare.</p><p>The blinking red dot on the map was right where I was hoping it would be. \u201cThe penthouse.\u201d</p><p>I shoved my feet into flip-flops and hurried back out to my purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you wearing?\u201d Cary asked from the kitchen, jolting me.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you just scared the shit out of me!\u201d</p><p>He sauntered up to the breakfast bar in just his Grey Isles boxer briefs, his chest and neck glistening with sweat. Since the air-conditioning was working fine and Trey was spending the night, I knew exactly how and why Cary was overheated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I did\u2014you can\u2019t go out like that,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d I slung my bag over my shoulder and headed toward the door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a freak, baby girl,\u201d he shouted after me. \u201cA woman after my own heart!\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>GIDEON\u2019S doorman didn\u2019t bat an eye when I climbed out of the back of the taxi in front of his building. Of course, the man had seen me in worse shape before. So had the concierge, who smiled and greeted me by name as if I didn\u2019t look like a crazy homeless person. Albeit one in a Burberry coat.</p><p>I walked as fast as I could in flip-flops to the private penthouse elevator, waited for it to descend to me, then keyed in the code. It was a straight shot up, but the ride felt endless. I wished I could pace the confines of the small, elegantly appointed car. My worried face stared back at me from the spotless mirrors.</p><p>Gideon hadn\u2019t called. Hadn\u2019t sent me a text after the flirtatious one promising me a steamy night. Hadn\u2019t come to me, even if only to sleep next door. Gideon didn\u2019t like being away from me.</p><p>Except when he was hurting. And ashamed.</p><p>The elevator doors slid open and pounding, screaming heavy metal music poured in. I cringed and covered my ears, the volume of the ceiling-mounted speakers so loud it hurt to hear them.</p><p>Pain. Fury. The raging violence of the music crashed over me. I ached deep in my chest. I knew. I understood. The song was an audible manifestation of what Gideon felt inside himself and couldn\u2019t let out.</p><p>He was too controlled. Contained. His emotions so tightly leashed, along with his memories.</p><p>I dug into my purse for my phone and ended up dropping the whole bag, spilling the contents onto the elevator car floor and across the checkerboard foyer. I left it all where it fell except for my smartphone, which I picked up and swiped through to get to the app that controlled the surround sound. I synced it to softer music, lowered the volume, and hit enter.</p><p>The penthouse fell silent for an endless moment, and then the gentle chords of \u201cCollide\u201d by Howie Day began to play.</p><p>I felt Gideon approaching before I saw him, the air crackling with the violent energy of an impending summer storm. He rounded the corner from the hallway leading to the bedrooms. I lost my breath.</p><p>He was shirtless and barefooted, his hair a silky tousled mane that brushed his shoulders. Black sweats clung to the lowest point of his hips, underlining the tight lacing of his abs. He was bruised on his ribs and up by his shoulder, the signs of battle only strengthening the impression of rage and ferocity tightly leashed.</p><p>My choice of music clashed with the emotion seething from him. My beautiful, savagely elegant warrior. The love of my life. So tormented that the sight of him brought hot, stinging tears to my eyes.</p><p>He jerked to a halt when he saw me, his hands clenching and releasing at his sides, his eyes wild and nostrils flaring.</p><p>My phone slid out of my hand and hit the floor. \u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a breath at the sound of my voice. It changed him. I watched the shift come over him, like a door slamming shut. One moment, he was bristling with emotion. The next, he was cool as ice, his surface as smooth as glass.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked, his voice dangerously even.</p><p>\u201cFinding you.\u201d Because he was lost.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fit company now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He was too still, as if he were afraid to move. \u201cYou should go. It\u2019s not safe for you here.\u201d</p><p>My pulse leaped. Awareness sizzled across my senses. I felt the heat of him from across the room. His need. The demand. I was suddenly melting in my jacket. \u201cI\u2019m safer with you than anywhere else on earth.\u201d I took a deep breath for courage. \u201cDoes Chris believe you?\u201d</p><p>His head went back. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called. He\u2019s worried about you. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he snapped. Which told me he wasn\u2019t fine now.</p><p>I made my way to him, feeling the burn of his gaze as it tracked me. \u201cOf course, you will be. You\u2019re married to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to go, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt almost hurts worse, doesn\u2019t it, when they believe you? You wonder why you waited to tell them. Maybe you could\u2019ve stopped it sooner, if you\u2019d just told the right person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always that little voice inside us that thinks we\u2019re to blame for what happened.\u201d</p><p>His eyes squeezed as tightly closed as his fists. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I closed the distance between us. \u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be what I need. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Those fiercely blue eyes snapped open, pinning me so thoroughly that I paused midstep. \u201cI\u2019m hanging on by a thread, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hang on,\u201d I told him, holding my hands out to him. \u201cLet go. I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t be gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to touch me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked. \u201cI want to fuck you. Hard.\u201d</p><p>I felt the heat sweep up to my cheeks. It was a testament to how much he wanted me that he could still find me desirable despite my ridiculous clothes. \u201cI\u2019m totally up for that. Always.\u201d</p><p>My fingers went to the lapels of my coat. I\u2019d partially buttoned up on the cab ride over, not wanting to flash anyone by accident. Now the trench was sweltering, my skin damp with perspiration.</p><p>Gideon lunged and caught my wrists, squeezing them too hard. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can handle you? After all we\u2019ve done together? All we\u2019ve talked about and plan on doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God. His entire body was straining, tense, every muscle thick and hard. And his eyes, so bright against his tanned skin, so agonized. My Dark and Dangerous.</p><p>He gripped my elbow and started walking.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d I stumbled.</p><p>He dragged me toward the elevator. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I struggled, kicking off my flip-flops and digging my feet in.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d He rounded on me and yanked me up, facing me nose to nose. \u201cI can\u2019t promise to stop. If I take you too far and you safe word, I might not stop and this\u2014us\u2014will all go to hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon! For chrissakes, don\u2019t be afraid to want me too much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to punish you,\u201d he snarled, gripping my face in both hands. \u201cYou did this! You brought this on. Pushing people . . . pushing me. Look what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p><p>I smelled the liquor on him then, the rich vapor of some expensive spirit. I\u2019d never seen him truly drunk\u2014he valued his control too much to completely dull his senses\u2014but he was drunk now.</p> <p>The first hint of wariness rippled through me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said shakily, \u201cthis is my fault. I love you too much. Will you punish me for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d He closed his eyes. His hot, damp forehead touched mine, nuzzling hard. His sweat coated my skin, imprinting me with the lushly masculine scent that was his alone.</p><p>I felt him soften, relaxing infinitesimally. I turned my head and pressed my lips to his feverish cheek.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gideon pulled me toward the elevator, yanking me into the foyer and kicking the scattered contents of my purse out of the way.</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I yelled, trying to tug my arm free.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t listen. His finger stabbed at the call button. The car doors opened instantly, the private elevator always waiting to take him down. He threw me in and I stumbled into the rear wall.</p><p>Desperate, I yanked at the belt of my coat, my urgency giving me strength. I tore at the buttons, sending them rolling in every direction. The doors were closing when I spun to face him, holding the lapels of my coat wide open so he could see what I was wearing beneath.</p><p>His arm shot out, blocking the door from closing. He shoved it open. The teddy I\u2019d worn was bloodred\u2014our color\u2014and had scarcely any material to it at all. Sheer mesh exposed my breasts and sex, while bandagelike cutouts caged my waist.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he hissed, stalking into the confined space, shrinking it too small. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop pushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your bitch,\u201d I shot back, feeling the tears well and fall. It was painful to have him so angry with me, even though I understood. He needed an outlet and I\u2019d positioned myself as the target. He\u2019d warned me . . . tried to protect me . . . \u201cI can take you, Gideon Cross. I can take whatever you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He tackled me back into the wall so hard the impact knocked the breath from me. His mouth covered mine, his tongue plunging deep. His hands squeezed my breasts roughly, his knee pressing hard between my legs.</p><p>I arched into him, fighting to shrug off my coat. I was too hot, sweat sliding down my back and belly. Gideon wrenched the trench off, tossing it aside, his mouth sealed to mine. A moan of gratitude escaped me, my arms wrapping around his neck, my heart swelling with the relief of holding him. My fingers pushed into his hair, my grip tightening to give me leverage to crawl up him.</p> <p>Gideon tore his mouth away, then my hands. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I snapped, too hurt to hold the words back. Just to spite him, I broke free of his grip and let my hands roam over his rock-hard shoulders and biceps.</p><p>He pushed me back, holding me to the wall with a single hand against the middle of my chest. No matter how I shoved or scratched at his steely arm, I couldn\u2019t budge him. I could only watch as he yanked the drawstring free of his sweats.</p><p>Desire and apprehension twisted together inside me. \u201cGideon . . . ?\u201d</p><p>His gaze met mine, so dark and haunted. \u201cCan you keep your hands off me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, he released me, only to spin me around to face the rear of the car. Caged by his body, I had little room to maneuver.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me,\u201d he ordered, his lips to my ear.</p><p>Then he tied my wrists to the handrail.</p><p>I froze, startled that he was actually restraining me. So surprised and disbelieving that I barely struggled. It was only after I watched him knot the thin cord that I realized he was serious.</p><p>Gripping my hips, he nuzzled my hair aside and sank his teeth into my shoulder. \u201cI say when.\u201d</p><p>I gasped, tugging at my hands. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer me.</p><p>He just left.</p><p>Twisting around as much as I was able, I caught him walking into the living room just as the doors slid shut.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I breathed. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d send me away like this . . . tied up in the elevator in only lingerie. He was presently screwed up in the head, yes, but I couldn\u2019t believe my wildly jealous husband would expose me that way, to whoever might be in the lobby, just to get rid of me.</p><p>\u201cGideon! Goddamn it. Don\u2019t you dare leave me in here like this! Do you hear me?! Get your ass back in here!\u201d</p><p>I wrenched at the cord binding my wrists, but it was knotted tight. Seconds passed, then minutes. The car didn\u2019t move and after screaming myself hoarse, I realized it wouldn\u2019t. It waited for the push of a button, standing by for Gideon\u2019s command.</p><p>Just like I was.</p><p>I was going to kick his fucking ass when I got loose. I\u2019d never been so pissed. \u201cGideon!\u201d</p><p>Bending over, I walked backward, then lifted and stretched one leg to reach the button that opened the doors. I pushed it with my big toe. As they slid open, I sucked in a deep breath to scream . . .</p><p>. . . then promptly lost it in a startled rush.</p><p>Gideon strode through the living room toward the foyer . . . completely naked. And drenched from head to toe. His cock was so hard it curved up to his navel. His head was tipped back as he guzzled bottled water, his stride loose and easy, yet entirely predatory.</p><p>I straightened as he drew closer, panting from both the riot of my emotions and the depth of my hunger. Asshole or not, I wanted him with a ferocity I couldn\u2019t fight. He was complicated and sexy, damaged and perfect.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He brought a crystal tumbler to my lips that I hadn\u2019t noticed because I\u2019d been too busy ogling his magnificent body. The glass was nearly full, the reddish-gold liquid sloshing against my lips as he tipped it.</p><p>My mouth opened by instinct and he poured the liquor in, the potent proof burning my tongue and throat. I coughed and he waited, his gaze heavy-lidded. He smelled clean and cool, refreshed from a shower.</p><p>\u201cFinish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too strong!\u201d I protested.</p><p>He simply poured another large swallow past my parted lips.</p><p>I kicked at him, cursing when I hurt my foot\u2014and didn\u2019t do any damage to him at all. \u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>He dropped the empty water bottle and cupped my face in his hand. His thumb brushed away the drops of liquor on my chin. \u201cYou need to let me settle, and you need to mellow out. We go at it like this, we\u2019ll tear each other apart.\u201d</p><p>A stupid tear slipped out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>Gideon groaned and bent toward me, his tongue licking the trail of the droplet off my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m shattered and you\u2019re beating at me with your fists. I can\u2019t take it, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take you shutting me out,\u201d I whispered, tugging at the damned cord. The liquor was spreading fire through my veins. I could feel the tendrils of intoxication curling around my senses already.</p><p>He put his hand over mine, stilling my restless movements. \u201cStop that. You\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut me loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou touch me and I can\u2019t keep it together. I\u2019m hanging by a thread,\u201d he said again, sounding desperate. \u201cI can\u2019t snap. Not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith someone else?\u201d My voice became shrill. \u201cYou need someone else?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t keep it together, either. Gideon was the rock in our relationship, the anchor. I thought I could be the same for him. I wanted to shelter him, be his haven. But Gideon didn\u2019t need shelter from the storm; he was the storm. And I wasn\u2019t strong enough to bear up under the weight of his crashing mood.</p><p>\u201cNo. Christ.\u201d He kissed me. Hard. \u201cYou need me in control. I need to be in control when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>I felt the panic building. He knew. He knew I wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cYou were different with the others. You didn\u2019t hold back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Gideon spun away, slamming his fist into the control panel. The doors opened to the sound of Sarah McLachlan singing about possession and he threw the tumbler, shattering it against the foyer wall. \u201cYes, I was different! You made me different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you hate me for that.\u201d I started crying, my body sagging into the car wall.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wrapped himself around me, his water-chilled body curving over my back. He rubbed his face against me, his embrace so tight I could barely breathe. \u201cI love you. You\u2019re my wife. My goddamn life. You\u2019re everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to help you,\u201d I cried. \u201cI want to be here for you, but you won\u2019t let me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Eva.\u201d His hands began to move, to pet and glide. To stroke. To soothe. \u201cI can\u2019t stop you. I need you too much.\u201d</p><p>I gripped the handrail with both hands, my cheek pressed to the cool mirror. The liquor began to work its magic. A heated languor slid through me, drowning my anger and what fight I had left until they drifted away, leaving me sad and afraid and so desperately, terrifyingly in love.</p><p>His hand pushed between my legs, rubbing, searching. With a forceful tug, he opened the snaps that held the front and back of the teddy together. I moaned at the sudden release of pressure. My sex was wet and swollen from the skilled movements of his hands and the image in my mind of the way he\u2019d looked walking toward me.</p><p>My head fell back against his shoulder and I saw his reflection. His eyes were closed, his lips parted. The vulnerability etched on his gorgeous face undid me. He was hurting so badly. I couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I can do,\u201d I whispered. \u201cTell me how to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d His tongue rimmed the shell of my ear. \u201cLet me settle.\u201d</p><p>The featherlight stroke of his thumb over the mesh covering my nipple was driving me mad. The slide of his fingers between the slick folds of my cleft had me quivering. He knew where to touch me, how much pressure.</p><p>I cried out when he pushed two fingers inside me, my feet flexing, lifting me onto my toes. My knees weakened, my legs quivering with the strain. The air in the elevator felt thick and steamy, heavy with the need that pumped off him in waves.</p><p>\u201cAh, Christ.\u201d He groaned when my sex tightened around him, his hips rolling against me to grind his erection into my buttocks. \u201cI\u2019m going to bruise this sweet cunt, Eva. I can\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p><p>His arm banded around my waist and lifted me, pulling me back so that my arms were straight and I was bent over. He kneed my legs apart, his fingers sliding wetly from my cleft. I felt his hand graze my hip, and then he was dragging the wide crest of his penis through the seam of my buttocks and notching it between the lips of my sex.</p><p>I held my breath, squirming against that plush pressure. I\u2019d wanted him all day, craving the feel of his big cock inside me, needing him to make me come.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he groaned, reaching for both my waist and my shoulder, his fingers flexing impatiently. \u201cLet me\u2014\u201d</p><p>My sex clenched, tightening around the thick head.</p><p>Gideon cursed and thrust, one hard stroke that shoved him deep. I cried out in pleasured pain, arching away from the rigid fullness, feeling the burn of stretching inner muscles and tender tissues.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed, yanking me back into him until the lips of my sex hugged the thick root of his penis. His hips circled, his balls lying heavily against my engorged clitoris. \u201cFucking tight . . .\u201d</p><p>I moaned and tried to hold on to the handrail; my body rocked as he began to fuck. The sensation was devastating, being filled so completely, then emptied abruptly. My knees gave out, my core spasming in delight as he reamed me hard and thoroughly. All the emotion he\u2019d pent up inside him was hammered into me, the relentless drives of his cock massaging every sensitive nerve.</p><p>I was coming before I knew the orgasm was on me, gasping his name as pleasure racked my body in violent trembles.</p><p>My head dropped between my arms, my muscles weak and useless. Gideon held me up with his hands, with his erection. Using my body. Taking it. Grunting primitively every time he hit the end of me.</p><p>\u201cSo deep,\u201d he growled. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>In the periphery, I caught movement, my dazed eyes focusing on our reflection. With a low, pained cry I started coming again, if I\u2019d ever stopped. Gideon was the most searingly erotic thing I\u2019d ever seen\u2014his biceps thick and hard as he supported my weight, his thighs straining with exertion, his ass flexing as he pistoned, his abs rippling with power as he rolled his hips with every stroke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been built to fuck, but he had mastered the skill, using every inch of his amazing body to enslave a woman to pleasure. It was innate to him, instinctive. Even drunk and near feral with anguish, his rhythm was tight and precise, his focus absolute.</p><p>Every thrust took him deep inside me, hitting the sweetest spots again and again, driving the ecstasy into me until I couldn\u2019t resist the onslaught. Another climax churned through me like a tidal wave.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he groaned. \u201cMilk my dick, angel. God . . . You\u2019re making me come.\u201d</p><p>I felt his cock thickening, lengthening. Tingles raced across my skin; my lungs heaved for air.</p><p>Gideon threw back his head and roared like an animal, spurting hotly. Gripping my hips, he pumped me onto his ejaculating cock, coming hard and forever, filling me until semen slicked my sex and inner thighs.</p><p>He slowed the thrust of his hips, gasping, bending over to press his cheek to my shoulder.</p><p>I started sinking to my knees. \u201cGideon . . .\u201d</p><p>He pulled me up. \u201cI\u2019m not done,\u201d he said roughly, still thick and stiff inside me.</p><p>Then he started again.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I woke to the feel of his hair brushing over my shoulder and the press of warm, firm lips. Exhausted, I tried to roll away, but an arm around my waist pulled me back.</p><p>\u201cEva,\u201d he rasped. His hand cupped my breast, clever fingers rolling my nipple.</p><p>It was dark and we were in bed, although I barely remembered him carrying me there. He\u2019d undressed me, washed me with a damp cloth, and rained kisses over my face and wrists. They were bandaged now, slicked with ointment and wrapped with care.</p><p>It had turned me on to feel his tender caresses over the chafing, the mix of pleasure and pain. He\u2019d noticed.</p><p>With eyes hot with lust, he\u2019d spread my legs and eaten me with an insistent demand that robbed me of the ability to think or move. He\u2019d licked and sucked my cleft endlessly, until I lost count of how many times he made me come around his wicked tongue.</p><p>\u201cGideon . . .\u201d Turning my head, I looked at him over my shoulder. He was propped on one arm, his eyes glittering in the faint light of the moon. \u201cDid you stay with me?\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was reckless to hope he\u2019d stayed with me while I slept, but sharing a bed with him was something I loved. And craved.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He rolled me over and into him, taking my mouth, kissing me softly. The coaxing licks of his tongue stirred me again, made me moan.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop touching you,\u201d he breathed, gripping my nape to hold me still as he deepened the kiss, his teeth tugging gently on my lower lip. \u201cWhen I touch you, I don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201d</p><p>Tenderness blended with the love. \u201cCan I touch you, too?\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, he begged. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p> <p>I surged into him, my hands sliding into his hair to hold him as he held me. I brushed my tongue against his, our mouths hot and wet. Our legs tangled, my body arching to press against the hardness of his.</p><p>He hummed softly and slowed me down, rolling to pin me to the bed. Pulling back, he broke the seal of our mouths, nibbling, sucking. Tracing the curves of my lips with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>I whimpered in protest, wanting deeper, harder. Instead, he licked leisurely, stroking the roof of my mouth, the lining of my cheeks. I tightened my legs, dragging him closer. He rocked his hips, pressing his erection into my thigh.</p><p>Gideon kissed me until my lips were hot and puffy and the sun was rising in the sky. He kissed me until he came in a hot rush against my skin. Not once but twice.</p><p>The feel of him coming, the sound of his low pained moans of pleasure, knowing I could bring him to orgasm with just my kiss . . . I slicked his thigh with my need and ground against him until I climaxed.</p><p>As the new day began, he closed the distance he\u2019d put between us in the elevator. He made love to me without sex. He pledged his devotion by making me the center of his world. There was nothing beyond the edges of our bed. Only us and a love that stripped us bare even as it made us whole.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>WHEN I woke again, I found him sleeping beside me, his lips as kiss-swollen as mine. Gideon\u2019s face was soft in repose, but the faint frown between his brows told me he wasn\u2019t resting as deeply as I would wish. He lay on his side, his body stretched long and lean across the mattress, the sheet tangled around his legs.</p><p>It was late, nearly nine, but I didn\u2019t have the heart to either wake him or leave him. I hadn\u2019t been at my job long enough to miss a day, but I decided to do it anyway.</p><p>I\u2019d been putting my needs first when it came to my career, giving it the power to someday put a wedge between us. I knew my desire to be independent wasn\u2019t wrong, but at that moment, it didn\u2019t feel right, either.</p><p>Pulling on a T-shirt and boyshorts, I slipped out of the bedroom and down the hall to Gideon\u2019s home office, where his smartphone was bitching that he was ignoring the alarm to wake him up. I turned it off and went to the kitchen.</p><p>Mentally checking off the things I needed to do, I called and left a message for Mark about missing work due to a family emergency. Then I called Scott\u2019s desk and left a message telling him that Gideon wasn\u2019t going to make it in by nine and might not be there at all. I told him to call me and we could talk about it.</p><p>I hoped to keep Gideon home all day, although I doubted he would agree to that. We needed time together, alone. Time to heal.</p><p>I retrieved my smartphone from the foyer and called Angus. He answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. Cross. Are you and Mr. Cross ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Angus, right now we\u2019re staying put. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll be leaving the penthouse today. I was wondering, do you know where Gideon gets those bottles of hangover cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Do you need one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon might when he wakes up. Just in case, I\u2019d like to have one waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d he asked, his Scottish burr more pronounced, \u201cdoes this have something to do with Mr. Vidal\u2019s visit last night?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at my forehead, feeling the warning signs of an impending headache. \u201cIt has everything to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Chris believe?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAch, that\u2019s why, then. The lad wouldna been prepared for that. Denial is what he knows and can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took it hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m certain he did. It\u2019s good he has you, Eva. You\u2019re doing the right thing for him, though it may take him time to appreciate it. I\u2019ll get that bottle for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>With that accomplished, I turned my attention to cleaning the place up. I washed the empty decanter and tumbler I found on the kitchen island first, then took the broom and dustpan into the foyer to clean up the shattered glass. I talked to Scott when he called while I was picking up all the crap that had fallen out of my purse, and when we hung up, I turned my attention to scrubbing the foyer wall and floor to remove the dried traces of brandy.</p><p>Gideon had said he felt shattered the night before. I didn\u2019t want him to wake up and find his place that way.</p><p>Our place, I corrected myself. Our home. I needed to start thinking of it that way. And so did Gideon. We were going to have a conversation about him trying to kick me out. If I was going to make a better effort at entwining our lives, then he had to as well.</p><p>I wished there were someone I could talk to about it all, a friend to listen and give sage advice. Cary or Shawna. Even Steven, who had a way about him that made him so easy to talk to. We had Dr. Petersen, but that wasn\u2019t the same thing.</p><p>For now, Gideon and I had secrets we could share only with each other, and that kept us isolated and codependent. It wasn\u2019t only innocence our abusers had taken away from us; they\u2019d also taken our freedom. Even after the abuse was long over, we were still caged by the false fronts we lived behind. Still caged by lies, but in a different way.</p><p>I had just finished polishing all the smudges off the mirror in the elevator when it began descending with me inside. In only a T-shirt and underwear.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I muttered, yanking off my rubber gloves to try to put order to my hair. After rolling around with Gideon all night, I looked like an epic mess.</p><p>The doors slid open and Angus started to step in, his footstep halting midair when he spotted me. I shifted position, trying to hide the cord still tied to the handrail behind me. Gideon had cut me loose with scissors, freeing my wrists but leaving the evidence.</p><p>\u201cUh, hi,\u201d I said, squirming with embarrassment. There was no good way to explain how I happened to be in the elevator, scarcely dressed and holding yellow rubber gloves, when Angus had called it down to pick him up. To make things worse, my lips were so red and swollen from kissing Gideon for hours that there was no way to hide what I\u2019d been up to all night.</p><p>Angus\u2019s pale blue eyes lit with amusement. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Angus,\u201d I replied, with as much dignity as I could manage.</p><p>He held out a bottle of the hangover \u201ccure,\u201d which I was pretty sure was just a shot of alcohol mixed with liquid vitamins. \u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The words were heartfelt and carried additional gratitude for his lack of questions.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need anything. I\u2019ll be nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Angus.\u201d I rode back up to the penthouse. When the doors opened, I heard the penthouse phone ringing.</p><p>I made a run for it, sliding into the kitchen on my bare feet to snatch the receiver off its base, hoping the noise hadn\u2019t woken Gideon.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, it\u2019s Arash. Is Cross with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s still sleeping, I think. I\u2019ll check.\u201d I headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not sick, is he? He\u2019s never sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a first time for everything.\u201d Peeking into the bedroom, I found my husband sprawled magnificently in sleep, his arms wrapped around my pillow with his face buried in it. I tiptoed over to put the hangover bottle on his nightstand, and then I tiptoed back out, pulling the door closed behind me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still crashed,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cWow. Okay, change of plan. There are some documents you both have to sign before four this afternoon. I\u2019ll have them messengered over. Give me a call when you\u2019re done with them, and I\u2019ll send someone to pick them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to sign something? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t ruin the surprise. You\u2019ll see when you get them. Call me if you have any questions.\u201d</p><p>I growled softly. \u201cOkay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I stared down the hall toward the bedroom with narrowed eyes. What was Gideon up to? It drove me crazy that he set things in motion and handled issues without talking to me about them.</p><p>My smartphone started ringing in the kitchen. I ran back across the living room and took a look at the screen. The number was an unfamiliar one but clearly based in New York.</p><p>\u201cGood grief,\u201d I muttered, feeling like I\u2019d already put in a full day of work and it was just past ten thirty in the morning. How the hell did Gideon manage being pulled in so many directions at once? \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, it\u2019s Chris again. I hope you don\u2019t mind that Ireland gave me your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call you back sooner. I didn\u2019t mean to make you worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay, then?\u201d</p><p>I went to one of the bar stools and sat. \u201cNo. It was a rough night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called his office. They told me he was out this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re home. He\u2019s still sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>He knew my man. Gideon was a creature of habit, his life rigidly ordered and compartmentalized. Any deviation from his established patterns was so rare it was cause for concern.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure of it. He just needs some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I think of anything, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He sounded tired and worried. \u201cThank you for saying something to me and being there for him. I wish I had been when it was happening. I\u2019ll have to live with the fact that I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have to live with it. It\u2019s not your fault, Chris. Doesn\u2019t make it easier, I know, but you need to keep it in mind or you\u2019ll beat yourself up. That won\u2019t help Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wise beyond your years, Eva. I\u2019m so glad he has you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lucky with him,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cBig-time.\u201d</p><p>I ended the call and couldn\u2019t help but think of my mother. Seeing what Gideon was going through made me appreciate her all the more. She had been there for me; she\u2019d fought for me. She had the guilt, too, which made her overprotective to the point of craziness, but there was a part of me that hadn\u2019t gotten quite so damaged as Gideon because of her love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I called her and she answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cEva. You\u2019ve been deliberately avoiding me. How am I supposed to plan your wedding without your input? There are so many decisions to make and if I make the wrong one, you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStressed,\u201d she said, her naturally breathy voice conveying more than a little accusation. \u201cHow could I be anything else? I\u2019m planning one of the most important days of your life all by myself and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking we could get together on Saturday and hash it all out, if that fits into your schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The hopeful pleasure in her voice made me feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d I had been thinking of the second wedding as being more for my mother than anyone else, but that was wrong. The wedding was important to Gideon and me, too, another opportunity for us to affirm our unbreakable bond. Not for the world to see, but for the two of us.</p><p>He had to stop pushing me away to protect me, and I had to stop worrying that I would disappear when I became Mrs. Gideon Cross.</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful, Eva! We could have brunch here with the wedding planner. Spend the afternoon going over all our options.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want something small, Mom. Intimate.\u201d Before she argued, I pressed forward with Gideon\u2019s solution. \u201cWe can go as crazy as you want with the reception, but I want our wedding to be private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva, people will be insulted if they\u2019re invited to the reception and not the ceremony!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not getting married for them. I\u2019m getting married because I\u2019m in love with the man of my dreams and we\u2019re going to spend the rest of our lives together. I don\u2019t want the focus to ever shift from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney . . .\u201d She sighed, as if I were clueless. \u201cWe can talk more about this on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I\u2019m not changing my mind.\u201d I felt a tingle race down my back and turned.</p><p>Gideon stood just beyond the threshold to the kitchen, watching me. He\u2019d pulled on the sweatpants from the night before and his hair was still mussed from sleep, his eyes heavy-lidded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go,\u201d I told my mom. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this weekend. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Eva. That\u2019s why I only want the best for you.\u201d</p><p>I killed the call and set my phone down on the island. Sliding off the seat, I faced him. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not at work,\u201d he said, his voice raspier, sexier, than usual.</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going in late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And you\u2019re not, either.\u201d I went to him, wrapping my arms around his waist. He was still warm from the bed. My sleepy, sensual dream come true. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hole up today, ace. Just you and me hanging out in our pajamas and relaxing.\u201d</p><p>His arm cinched around my hips, his other hand lifting to brush the hair back from my face. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I be?\u201d Lifting onto my tiptoes, I kissed his jaw. \u201cAre you mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cupped my nape, pressing my cheek to his. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be here. Until death do us part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard that, huh? If you\u2019ve got requests, tell me now or forever hold your peace.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time, long enough that I figured he didn\u2019t have anything to add.</p><p>Turning my head, I caught his lips and gave him a quick, sweet kiss. \u201cDid you see what I left you by the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d A ghost of a smile touched his mouth.</p><p>He looked like a man who\u2019d been well fucked, which filled me with feminine pride. \u201cI got you off the hook at work, too, but Arash said he had some papers to send over to us. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to wait and find out.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my fingertips over his brow. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>His shoulder lifted in a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Right now, I just feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s revisit that bath you missed last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, I\u2019m feeling better already.\u201d</p><p>Linking our fingers together, I started leading him back toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI want to be the man of your dreams, angel,\u201d he said, surprising me. \u201cI want that more than anything.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that in the bag already.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I stared down at the contract in front of me, my heart racing with a dizzying combination of love and delight. I looked up from the coffee table as Gideon entered the room, his hair still damp from our bath, his long legs encased in black silk pajama bottoms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re buying the Outer Banks house?\u201d I asked, needing his confirmation despite having the proof in front of me.</p><p>His sexy mouth curved. \u201cWe\u2019re buying the house. We agreed we would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about it.\u201d The agreed-upon price was a bit staggering, telling me the owners hadn\u2019t been easy to persuade. And he\u2019d asked them to convey the copy of Naked in Death with the property, along with the furnishings in the master bedroom. He always thought of everything.</p><p>Gideon settled on the couch beside me. \u201cNow, we\u2019re doing something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Hamptons would be closer. Or Connecticut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a quick hop down by jet.\u201d He tipped my chin up with his finger and pressed his lips to mine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the logistics,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe were happy there on the beach. I can still picture you walking along the shore. I remember kissing you on the deck . . . spreading you across that big white bed. You looked like an angel and that place, for me, was like heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I rested my forehead against his. I loved him so much. \u201cWhere do we sign?\u201d</p><p>He pulled back and slid the contract over, finding the first yellow sign here flag. His gaze roved over the coffee table and he frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s my pen?\u201d</p><p>I stood. \u201cI\u2019ve got one in my purse.\u201d</p><p>Catching my wrist in his hand, he tugged me back down. \u201cNo. I need my pen. Where\u2019s the envelope this came in?\u201d</p><p>I spotted it lying on the floor between the couch and table, where I\u2019d dropped it when I realized what Arash had sent over. Picking it up, I realized it was still weighted and upended it over the table to let the rest of the items inside spill out. A fountain pen clattered onto the glass and a small photo floated out.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d he said, taking the pen and slashing his signature on the dotted line. As he went through the rest of the pages, I picked up the picture and felt my chest tighten.</p><p>It was the photo of him and his dad on the beach, the one he\u2019d told me about in North Carolina. He was young, maybe four or five, his small face screwed up in concentration as he helped his dad build a sand castle. Geoffrey Cross sat across from his son, his dark hair blowing in the ocean breeze, his face movie-star handsome. He wore only swimming trunks, showing off a body very much like the one Gideon boasted today.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathed, knowing I was going to make copies of the image and frame one for each of the places we lived in. \u201cI love this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He pushed the contract, with the pen lying atop it, over to me.</p><p>I set the photo down and picked up the pen, turning it over to see the GC engraved on the barrel. \u201cYou superstitious or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked at him.</p><p>\u201cHe signed everything with it. He never went anywhere without it tucked in his pocket.\u201d He raked his hair back from his face. \u201cHe destroyed our name with that pen.\u201d</p><p>I set my hand on his thigh. \u201cAnd you\u2019re building it back up with the same pen. I get it.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips touched my cheek, his gaze soft and shining. \u201cI knew you would.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>\u201cHIS-AND-HERS MASTER SUITE\u2014a classic.\u201d Blaire Ash smiled as his pen flew across the large notepad clipped to a board.</p><p>His gaze lifted to roam the entirety of Eva\u2019s bedroom in the penthouse, the one I\u2019d had him design specifically to look exactly like the room my wife had in her Upper West Side apartment.</p><p>\u201cHow big a change are you looking for?\u201d the designer asked. \u201cDo you want to start with a blank slate, or are you just looking for the easiest structural change that will combine the two rooms?\u201d</p><p>I left it to Eva to answer. It was difficult for me to participate, knowing this change was one neither of us really wanted. Our home would soon reflect how fucked up I was and how badly our marriage was affected because of it. The whole exercise was like a knife in the gut.</p><p>She glanced at me, then asked, \u201cWhat would the easy way look like?\u201d</p><p>Ash smiled, revealing slightly crooked teeth. He was attractive\u2014or so Ireland assured me\u2014and sported his usual attire of ripped jeans and a T-shirt under a tailored blazer. I couldn\u2019t care less about his looks. What mattered was his talent, which I\u2019d admired enough to hire him to decorate both my office and my home. What I didn\u2019t like was the way he was looking at my wife.</p><p>\u201cWe could simply adjust the layout of the master bath and knock out an arched entry through this wall, effectively joining the two rooms via the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what we need,\u201d Eva said.</p><p>\u201cRight. It\u2019s quick and efficient, and the actual construction wouldn\u2019t be all that disruptive to your lives. Or\u201d\u2014he went on\u2014\u201cI could show you some alternatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He moved to her side, so close that his shoulder pressed against hers. Ash was nearly as blond as Eva, the image of them striking as he bent his head to hers.</p><p>\u201cIf we work with the square footage of all three bedrooms and master bathroom,\u201d he replied, speaking only to her as if I weren\u2019t there, \u201cI could give you a master suite that\u2019s balanced on both sides. Both bedrooms would be the same size, with his-and-hers adjoining home offices\u2014or sitting room, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nipped absently at her lower lip for a second. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you sketched that up so quickly.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her. \u201cFast and thorough is my motto. And getting the job done so well that you think of me when you want to do it again.\u201d</p><p>I lounged against the wall, my arms crossing as I watched them. Eva seemed oblivious to the designer\u2019s double entendre. I was anything but.</p><p>The house phone rang and her head came up. She looked at me. \u201cI bet Cary\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get that, angel?\u201d I drawled. \u201cMaybe you should bring him up yourself, share your excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d She ran her hand over my arm as she hurried from the room, a fleeting touch that reverberated through me.</p><p>I straightened, focusing on Ash. \u201cYou\u2019re flirting with my wife.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened abruptly, the smile leaving his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I just want Miss Tramell to feel comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll worry about her. You worry about me.\u201d I didn\u2019t doubt that he questioned the arrangement we\u2019d consulted him to implement. Everyone who saw it would. What red-blooded man in his right mind would have a wife like Eva, yet sleep not just in a different bed but a different room altogether?</p><p>The knife dug in a little deeper and twisted.</p><p>His dark eyes went flat and hard. \u201cOf course, Mr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve sketched so far.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cWHAT do you think?\u201d Eva asked, between bites of pepperoni and basil pizza. She leaned over the island, with one leg kicked up behind her, having chosen to stand on the opposite side from where Cary and I sat.</p><p>I debated my reply.</p><p>\u201cI mean the idea of a master suite with two mirroring sides is lovely,\u201d she went on, wiping at her mouth with a paper napkin, \u201cbut if we go the easy route, it\u2019ll be faster. Plus we could close up the wall again one day, if we want to use the room for something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a nursery,\u201d Cary said, shaking crushed red pepper onto his slice.</p><p>My appetite died and I dropped the slice I\u2019d been eating onto my paper plate. Lately, eating pizza at home hadn\u2019t been working out for me.</p><p>\u201cOr a guest room,\u201d Eva corrected. \u201cI liked what you talked to Blaire about for your apartment.\u201d</p><p>Cary shot her a look. \u201cQuick dodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you may have babies on your mind, but the rest of us have other things to check off our lists first.\u201d</p><p>She was saying exactly what I wanted her to say, but . . .</p><p>Did Eva have the same fears I did? Maybe she\u2019d taken me as a husband because she couldn\u2019t help herself, but drew the line at taking me as a father to her children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I carried my plate to the trash and tossed it in. \u201cI have some calls to make. Stay,\u201d I said to Cary. \u201cSpend time with Eva.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the kitchen, I crossed the living room.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Cary began, before I stepped out of earshot, \u201chot-designer-dude\u2019s got a thing for your man, baby girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe does not!\u201d Eva laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument there, but that Ash guy barely glanced at you all night and kept his eyes glued on Cross.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. Ash had gotten the message, which reaffirmed my belief in his intelligence. Cary was free to read that however he liked.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re right,\u201d she said, \u201cI have to admire his taste.\u201d</p><p>I headed down the hallway and entered my home office, my gaze landing on the collage of Eva\u2019s photos on the wall.</p> <p>She was the one thing I couldn\u2019t tuck neatly away in my mind. She was always at the forefront, driving everything I did.</p><p>Settling down at my desk, I got to work, hoping to catch up on what I could so that the rest of the week wouldn\u2019t be thrown completely off. It took me a bit to get my head in the game, but once I did, I felt relief. It was a reprieve to focus on problems with concrete solutions.</p><p>I was making headway when I heard a yell from the living room that sounded like it had come from Eva. I paused, listening. It was quiet a moment, and then I heard it again, followed by Cary\u2019s raised voice. I went to the door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cYou could talk to me, Cary!\u201d my wife said angrily. \u201cYou could tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what the fuck is going on,\u201d he retorted, the edge in his tone drawing me out of my office.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were cutting again!\u201d</p> <p>I moved down the hall. Eva and Cary squared off in the living room, the two friends glaring at each other across the span of several feet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d he said, his shoulders high and chin canted defensively. He glanced at me. \u201cNot yours, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t disagree,\u201d I replied, although that wasn\u2019t quite true. How Cary self-destructed wasn\u2019t my concern; how it affected Eva was.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. That\u2019s total fucking bullshit.\u201d Eva\u2019s gaze shot to me as she turned to bring me into their conversation. Then she looked back at Cary. \u201cI thought you were talking to Dr. Travis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I have time for that?\u201d he scoffed, raking his hair back off his forehead. \u201cBetween my work and Tat\u2019s, plus trying to keep Trey, I don\u2019t have time to sleep!\u201d</p><p>Eva shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s a cop-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lecture me, baby girl,\u201d he warned. \u201cI don\u2019t need your shit right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She tipped her head back and looked at the ceiling. \u201cWhy the fuck do the men in my life insist on shutting me out when they need me most?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t speak for Cross, but you\u2019re not around for me anymore. I\u2019m getting by the best I can.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped down. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You have to tell me when you need me. I\u2019m not a damn mind reader!\u201d</p><p>Turning on my heel, I left them to it. I had problems of my own to work out. When Eva was ready, she\u2019d come to me and I would listen, being careful not to offer too much of my opinion.</p><p>I knew she didn\u2019t want to hear that I thought she would be better off without Cary.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE early-morning light slanted across the bed and caught the ends of Eva\u2019s hair as she slept. The soft blond strands glowed like burnished gold, as if they were lit from within. Her hand curled gently on the pillow beside her beautiful face, the other tucked safely between her breasts. The white sheet was draped over her from hip to thigh, her tanned legs exposed by the tangle we\u2019d made before falling asleep.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t a man given to whimsy, but at that moment my wife looked like the angel I believed she was. I focused the camera on the sight she made, wanting to preserve that image of her for all time.</p><p>The shutter snapped and she stirred, her lips parting. I took another shot, grateful I\u2019d bought a camera that just might do justice to her.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered open. \u201cWhat are you doing, ace?\u201d she asked, in a voice as smoky as her irises.</p><p>I set the camera on the dresser and joined her in the bed. \u201cAdmiring you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter is good.\u201d Rolling, she reached for her breath mints. She turned back to me smelling of cinnamon. Her gaze slid over my face. \u201cYou\u2019re ready to tackle the world today, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d much rather stay home with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that. You\u2019re itching to get back to global domination.\u201d</p><p>Bending down, I kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cYou know me so well.\u201d</p><p>It still amazed me how well she could read me. I was feeling restless, a bit shaky. Distracting myself with work\u2014seeing concrete progress made on any of the projects I was personally overseeing\u2014would ease that. Still, I pointed out, \u201cI could work the morning at home, and then spend the afternoon with you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIf you want to talk, I\u2019ll stay home. Otherwise, I\u2019ve got a job to get back to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you worked with me, you could cybercommute, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather push me on that, huh? That\u2019s the tack you wanna take?\u201d</p><p>I rolled onto my back and slung my forearm over my eyes. She hadn\u2019t pushed me the day before and I knew she wouldn\u2019t push me today. Or tomorrow. Like Dr. Petersen, she\u2019d wait patiently for me to open up. But knowing she was waiting was pressure enough.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIt happened. Now Chris knows. Talking about it after the fact won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>I felt her turn toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s not talking about the events themselves that matters, it\u2019s how you feel about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel anything. It . . . surprised me. I don\u2019t like surprises. Now, I\u2019m over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d She slid out of bed faster than I could catch her. \u201cIf you\u2019re just going to lie, keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>Sitting up, I watched her round the foot of the bed, the tight set of her shoulders doing nothing to detract from how stunning she was. My need for her was a constant thrumming in my blood, so easily provoked by her fiery Latin temper into a restlessly impatient craving.</p><p>I\u2019d heard some say my wife was as breathtaking as her mother, but I disagreed. Monica Stanton was a cool beauty, one who gave off the air of being slightly out of reach. Eva was all heat and sensuality\u2014you could reach her, but her passion would scorch you.</p><p>I jumped out of bed and waylaid her before she reached the bathroom, gripping her by the upper arms. \u201cI can\u2019t fight with you right now,\u201d I told her honestly, staring down into the roiling depths of her turbulent gaze. \u201cIf we\u2019re out of sync, I won\u2019t make it through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re over it when you\u2019re struggling to keep it together!\u201d</p><p>I growled, frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with this. I don\u2019t see how Chris knowing changes anything.\u201d</p><p>Her chin tilted up. \u201cHe\u2019s worried about you. Are you going to call him?\u201d</p><p>My head turned away. When I thought of seeing my stepfather again, my stomach churned. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him at some point. We do manage a business together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather avoid him. Tell me why.\u201d</p><p>I pushed back from her. \u201cWe\u2019re not suddenly going to be the best of friends, Eva. We rarely saw each other before, and I see no reason for that to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Why the fuck is it my job to make him feel better?\u201d I headed for the shower.</p><p>She followed. \u201cNothing is going to make him feel better, and I don\u2019t think he expects that of you. He just wants to know that you\u2019re back on your stride.\u201d</p><p>I reached into the stall and turned the taps on.</p><p>Her hand touched my back. \u201cGideon . . . you can\u2019t just shove your feelings into a box. Not unless you want an explosion like the other night. Or another nightmare.\u201d</p><p>It was the mention of my recurrent nightmares that had me rounding on her. \u201cWe managed the last two nights just fine!\u201d</p><p>Eva didn\u2019t back down in the face of my fury the way others did, which only aggravated me further. And seeing the myriad reflections of her naked body in the mirrors didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep on Tuesday night,\u201d she challenged. \u201cAnd last night you were so exhausted, I doubt you even dreamed at all.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know I\u2019d slept part of the night in the other bedroom, and I didn\u2019t see any reason to mention it. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me! It helps to talk things over, Gideon. Laying it all out helps us gain perspective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerspective? I\u2019ve got that just fine. There was no mistaking the pity on Chris\u2019s face last night. Or yours! I don\u2019t need anyone feeling sorry for me, damn it. I don\u2019t need their fucking guilt.\u201d</p><p>Her brows shot up. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Chris, but that wasn\u2019t pity you saw on me, Gideon. Sympathy, maybe, because I know what you\u2019re feeling. And pain, certainly, because my heart is connected to yours. When you\u2019re hurting, I\u2019m hurting, too. You\u2019ll have to learn to deal with that, because I love you and I\u2019m not going to stop.\u201d</p><p>Her words ripped into me. Reaching out, I gripped the edge of the shower\u2019s floating glass.</p><p>Relenting, she came to me, wrapped herself around me. My head bowed as I soaked her in. The smell of her, the feel. My free arm slid around her hips, my hand cupping the full curve of her ass. I wasn\u2019t the same man I\u2019d been when we met. I was stronger in some ways and weaker in others. It was the weakness I struggled with. I used to feel nothing. And now\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t see you as weak,\u201d she murmured, reading me the way she always could. Her cheek lay over my heart. \u201cNo one could. After what you\u2019ve been through . . . to be the man you are today. That\u2019s strength, baby. And I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>My fingers flexed into her supple flesh. \u201cYou\u2019re biased,\u201d I muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. How could I be anything else? You\u2019re amazing and perfect\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grunted.</p><p>\u201cPerfect for me,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd since you belong to me, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><p>I tugged her back and into the shower, leading her under the pounding jets of warm water. \u201cI feel like this changed things,\u201d I admitted, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe figure it out together.\u201d Her hands ran over my shoulders and down my arms. \u201cJust don\u2019t push me away. You have to stop trying to protect me, especially from yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hurt you, angel. Can\u2019t take any risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I can take you down, ace, if you get out of hand.\u201d</p><p>If that were true, it might have been a comfort.</p><p>I switched gears, hoping to avoid a fight that would send ripples through the rest of my day. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the penthouse renovations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe exhausted the subject. It\u2019s not closed,\u201d I qualified, \u201cjust tabled until there are additional variables to address.\u201d</p><p>She eyed me. \u201cWhy does it turn me on when you go all alpha mogul on me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me there are times when I don\u2019t turn you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish. I\u2019d be a more productive human being.\u201d</p><p>I brushed the wet hair back from her forehead. \u201cHave you thought about what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever ends with your cock inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. I was talking about the penthouse.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, her eyes lit with mischievous amusement. \u201cSame goes either way.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>IT was the sort of local eatery that tourists never spared a glance. Small and lacking in aesthetics, it boasted a vinyl marquee that did nothing to brand it as unique or welcoming. It specialized in soup, with sandwich options for those with heartier appetites. A cooler by the door offered a limited selection of beverages, while an ancient register was only capable of taking cash.</p><p>No, travelers would never come to this place run by immigrants who\u2019d decided to take a bite out of the Big Apple. They\u2019d head to the spots made famous by movies or television shows, or those that dotted the garish spectacle of Times Square. The locals, however, knew the gem in their neighborhood and lined up outside the door.</p><p>I slid through that line to reach the back, where a tiny room held a handful of chipped enamel-topped tables. A lone man sat at one of them, reading the day\u2019s paper while steam curled out of his cup of soup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulling out the chair opposite him, I sat.</p><p>Benjamin Clancy didn\u2019t look up when he spoke. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Cross?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I owe you thanks.\u201d</p><p>He folded the paper leisurely and then set it aside, his gaze meeting mine. The man was solidly built, thick with muscle. His hair was dark blond, cut short in a military style. \u201cDo you? Well, then, I accept. Although I didn\u2019t do it for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you did.\u201d I studied him. \u201cYou\u2019re still keeping watch.\u201d</p><p>Clancy nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s been through enough. I\u2019m going to see she doesn\u2019t go through any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you enough to trust you. In my opinion, neither does she. So I\u2019ll keep an eye on things for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her. I think I\u2019ve proven how far I\u2019ll go to protect her.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze hardened. \u201cSome men need to be put down like rabid dogs. Some men need to be the ones to do it. I didn\u2019t peg you as one of those guys either way. That makes you rogue in my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take care of what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you took care of it all right.\u201d His smile didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cAnd I took care of the rest. As long as Eva is happy with you, we\u2019ll leave it at that. You decide someday she\u2019s not what you want, you cut her off clean and with respect. If you hurt her in any way at all, then you\u2019ve got a problem, whether I\u2019m still breathing or in the grave. You got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to threaten me to be good to her, but I heard you.\u201d Eva was a strong woman. Strong enough to survive her past and to pledge her future to me. But she was vulnerable, too, in ways most people didn\u2019t see. That was why I would do anything to shield her, and it seemed Benjamin Clancy felt the same.</p><p>I leaned forward. \u201cEva doesn\u2019t like being spied on. If you become a problem for her, we\u2019ll sit down like this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning on making it a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. If she catches you at it, it won\u2019t be because I tipped her off. Just keep in mind that she\u2019s spent her life looking over her shoulder and being suffocated by her mother. She\u2019s breathing easy for the first time. I won\u2019t let you take that away from her.\u201d</p><p>Clancy narrowed his eyes. \u201cI guess we understand each other.\u201d</p><p>I pushed back from the table and stood, extending my hand. \u201cI\u2019d say we do.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>AS my day ended and I cleared off my desk, I felt solid and settled.</p><p>There in my office, at the helm of Cross Industries, I had a handle on every detail. I doubted nothing, least of all myself.</p><p>The ground had leveled beneath my feet. I\u2019d smoothed the feathers ruffled by my Wednesday cancellations, while staying on track with my Thursday. Despite missing a full day, I was no longer behind.</p><p>Scott walked in. \u201cI\u2019ve confirmed your agenda for tomorrow. Mrs. Vidal will meet you and Miss Tramell at The Modern at noon.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. I\u2019d forgotten about lunch with my mother.</p><p>I glanced at him. \u201cThank you, Scott. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Mr. Cross. See you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my shoulders back, I walked over to the window and looked out at the city. Things had been easier before Eva. Simpler. During the day, while consumed with work, I\u2019d taken a moment to miss that simplicity.</p><p>Now, with the evening upon me and time to think, the prospect of major alterations to the home I\u2019d come to see as a refuge bothered me more than I would admit to my wife. On top of the other personal pressures we faced, I felt almost crushed by the scale of the adjustments I was making.</p><p>Waking up to Eva as she\u2019d been that morning was worth it all, but that didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t struggling with the aftermath of her entry into my life.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I turned at the sound of Scott\u2019s voice and found him standing in the doorway to my office. \u201cYou\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI was on my way out to the elevators when Cheryl caught me at reception. There\u2019s a Deanna Johnson in the lobby asking for you. I wanted to confirm that I should tell her you\u2019re no longer available today.\u201d</p><p>I was tempted to turn her away. I had little patience for reporters and even less for former lovers. \u201cThey can send her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can go. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I watched him leave, then watched Deanna arrive. She strode toward my office on long legs and high heels, her thin gray skirt skimming the tops of her knees. Long dark hair swayed around her shoulders, framing the zipper that gave her otherwise traditional blouse an edge.</p><p>She tossed me a megawatt smile and held out her hand. \u201cGideon. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>I shook her hand briefly and briskly. \u201cI expect you wouldn\u2019t go to the trouble of coming here directly unless it was important.\u201d</p><p>The statement was both fact and a warning. We had come to an understanding, but it wouldn\u2019t last if she thought she could exploit our connection beyond what I\u2019d already conceded.</p><p>\u201cWorth it for the view,\u201d she said, her eyes on me for just a second too long before shifting sideways to the window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ve got an appointment, so we\u2019ll have to make this quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a hurry, too.\u201d Tossing her hair over her shoulder, she moved to the nearest chair and sat, crossing her legs in a way that showed more of her toned thigh than I wanted to see. She started digging into her large bag.</p><p>I pulled my smartphone out of my pocket, checked the time, and called Angus. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready in ten,\u201d I told him when he answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the car around.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, I glanced at Deanna, impatient for her to get to the point.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eva?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here in a few moments. You can ask her yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked up at me, one eye hidden behind the fall of her hair. \u201cI should probably be gone before she gets here. I think our . . . history makes her uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows how I was,\u201d I said evenly, \u201cand she knows I\u2019m not that way now.\u201d</p><p>Deanna nodded. \u201cOf course she does, and of course you\u2019re not, but no woman likes when her man\u2019s past gets rubbed in her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to make sure you don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Another warning.</p><p>She withdrew a thin folder from her bag. Standing, she walked toward me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I accepted your apology and appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Corinne Giroux you might want to worry about.\u201d</p><p>What patience I\u2019d had disappeared. \u201cCorinne is her husband\u2019s concern, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Deanna held the folder out to me. I took it and opened it, finding a press release inside.</p><p>As I read, my grip tightened until I crumpled the edges.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sold a tell-all book about your relationship,\u201d she said redundantly. \u201cThe release officially hits the wire Monday morning at nine.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>\u201cOTHER COUPLES MEET, hit things off, their friends nitpick a little but are mostly supportive, and they coast for a while in that couple stage just enjoying each other.\u201d I sighed and glanced at Gideon, who sat beside me on the couch. \u201cWe, on the other hand, can\u2019t seem to catch a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of breaks are you referring to?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked, eyeing us with fond interest.</p><p>That fondness gave me hope. As soon as Gideon and I had arrived, I\u2019d noticed the change in the dynamic between him and Dr. Petersen. There was something looser between them, a new ease. Less wariness.</p><p>\u201cThe only people who really want us to be together are my mother\u2014who thinks us loving each other is a bonus to his billions\u2014and his stepfather and sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair assessment of your mother,\u201d Dr. Petersen said, sitting back and holding my gaze. \u201cShe wants you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, a lot of being happy for my mom is being financially secure, which I just don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s ever struggled for money, so why is she so afraid of not having any? Anywayyyy . . .\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just irritated with everyone right now. Gideon and I get along great when it\u2019s just the two of us. I mean we fight sometimes, but we always get through it. And I feel like we\u2019re always stronger once we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you fight about?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Gideon again. He sat beside me totally at ease, looking gorgeous and successful in his beautifully tailored suit. It was on my to-do list to go with him the next time he updated his wardrobe. I wanted to watch them measure that stunning body of his, see them select the materials and style.</p><p>I found him sexy as sin in jeans and a T-shirt, and mind-blowing in a tuxedo. But I\u2019d always have a special fondness for the three-piece suits he favored. They reminded me of how he\u2019d been when I first met him, so beautiful and seemingly unattainable, a man I\u2019d wanted so desperately that the need overrode even my sense of self-preservation.</p><p>I looked back at Dr. Petersen. \u201cWe still argue about the things he doesn\u2019t tell me. And we argue when he tries to shut me out.\u201d</p><p>He turned his gaze to Gideon. \u201cDo you feel the need to maintain a certain distance from Eva?\u201d</p><p>My husband\u2019s mouth curved wryly. \u201cThere is no distance between us, Doctor. She wants me to dump everything on her that\u2019s an irritant to me and I won\u2019t do that. Ever. It\u2019s bad enough if one of us has to bother with it.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cI think that\u2019s crap. Part of a relationship is sharing the load with someone else. Maybe sometimes I can\u2019t do anything about the problem, but I can be a sounding board. I think you don\u2019t tell me things just because you\u2019d rather shove them into a corner where you can ignore them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople process information in different ways, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t buying Gideon\u2019s dismissive reply. \u201cYou\u2019re not processing, you\u2019re ignoring. And I\u2019m never going to be okay with you pushing me away when you\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does he push you away?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked.</p><p>I looked at him. \u201cGideon . . . separates himself. He goes somewhere else where he can be alone. He won\u2019t let me help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Goes somewhere else\u2019 how? Do you emotionally withdraw, Gideon? Or physically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d I said. \u201cHe shuts down emotionally and goes away physically.\u201d</p><p>Gideon reached over and took my hand in his. \u201cI can\u2019t shut down with you. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need space,\u201d I said to Dr. Petersen, \u201che needs me, but he cuts me off because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll hurt me if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you hurt her, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d He exhaled harshly. \u201cEva has triggers. I keep them in mind, all the time. I\u2019m careful. But sometimes, when I\u2019m not thinking clearly, it\u2019s possible I could cross the line.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen studied us. \u201cWhat lines are you worried about crossing?\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s grip tightened on my hand, the only outward sign he gave of any uneasiness. \u201cThere are times when I need her too much. I can be rough . . . demanding. Sometimes, I don\u2019t have the control I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about your sexual relationship?\u201d He returned Gideon\u2019s nod. \u201cWe\u2019ve touched on that briefly before. You said you have sex multiple times a day, every day. Is that still the case?\u201d</p><p>I felt my face heat.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s thumb stroked over the back of my hand. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen set his tablet aside. \u201cYou\u2019re right to be concerned. Gideon, you may be using sex to keep Eva at an emotional distance. When you\u2019re making love, she\u2019s not talking, you\u2019re not answering. There\u2019s a point when you\u2019re not even thinking, your body is in charge and your brain is just along for the endorphin ride. Conversely, sexual abuse survivors like Eva often use sex as a way to establish an emotional connection. Can you see the problem there? You may be trying to achieve distance through sex, while Eva is trying to get closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you there\u2019s no distance.\u201d Gideon leaned forward, pulling my hand into his lap. \u201cNot with Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, when you\u2019re struggling emotionally and you initiate sex with Eva, what is it you\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>I twisted a little to look at Gideon, totally invested in his answer. I\u2019d never questioned why he needed to be inside me, only how. For me, it was as simple as him needing and me giving.</p><p>His gaze met mine. The shield over his eyes, that mask of his, slipped away. I saw the longing there, the love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe connection,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere\u2019s this moment. She opens and I . . . I open, and we\u2019re there. Together. I need that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need it rough?\u201d</p><p>Gideon looked at him. \u201cSometimes. There are times when she holds back. But I can get her there. She wants me to get her there, needs it like I do. I have to push. Carefully. With control. When I don\u2019t have the control, I need to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you push?\u201d Dr. Petersen asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen turned his attention to me. \u201cHas Gideon ever gone too far?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever worry that he might?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>His gaze was soft and capped with a frown. \u201cYou should, Eva. You both should.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I was stirring vegetables and cubed chicken into a curry mix on the stove when I heard the front door opening. Curious, I waited to see who came into view, hoping Cary had come home alone.</p><p>\u201cSmells good,\u201d he said, walking up to the breakfast bar to watch me. He looked cool and casual in an oversized white V-neck T-shirt and khaki shorts. Sunglasses hung off his collar and wide brown leather cuffs hugged each forearm, hiding the threadlike cuts I\u2019d spotted the night before.</p><p>\u201cGot enough for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust you?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled his cocky smile, but I saw the tightness around his mouth. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ve got enough, if you pour the wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got yourself a deal.\u201d</p><p>Joining me in the kitchen, he looked over my shoulder and into the pot. \u201cWhite or red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s chicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite it is, then. Where\u2019s Cross?\u201d</p><p>I watched him head to the wine fridge. \u201cWith his trainer, working out. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSame shit as always.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCary.\u201d I lowered the heat and turned to him. \u201cJust a few weeks ago, you were so happy to be here in New York and getting jobs. Now . . . you\u2019re so unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Pulling a bottle out, he shrugged again. \u201cThat\u2019s what I get for fucking around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been here for you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me as he dug out the bottle opener. \u201cBut . . . ?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo buts. I\u2019m sorry. I will say that you\u2019ve had company most nights I\u2019m home, so I figured that\u2019s why we weren\u2019t talking as much, but that doesn\u2019t excuse me from not reaching out when I know you\u2019re going through a difficult time.\u201d</p><p>Cary sighed, his head bowing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t fair to dump everything on you last night. I know Cross has got his own shit to wade through and you\u2019re dealing with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not here for you.\u201d I put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cAnytime you need me, just let me know and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Turning abruptly, he caught me up in a powerful hug, squeezing the air out of me. Sympathy did the rest of the work, squeezing my heart.</p><p>I hugged him in return, one hand stroking the back of his head. His dark brown hair was as soft as silk, his shoulders as hard as granite. I guessed they\u2019d have to be to hold up the weight of the stress he was carrying. Guilt made me hold him even tighter.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked this all up to hell and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He set me down, then turned back to the bottle to open it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s hormones or what, but Tat is a raging fucking bitch right now. Nothing is good enough. Nothing makes her happy, especially being pregnant. What shot has the poor kid got with me as a father and a self-centered diva who hates him as his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a girl,\u201d I said, handing over the wineglasses I\u2019d pulled out of the cupboard.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Don\u2019t say that. I\u2019m panicked enough as it is.\u201d He poured two hefty glasses, slid one over to me, and drank deep from his own. \u201cAnd I feel like an asshole talking about the mother of my baby that way, but it\u2019s the truth. God help us, it\u2019s the damned truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just the hormones. It\u2019ll all settle in, and then she\u2019ll get that glow and be happy.\u201d I took a sip, hoping like hell everything I was saying would come true. \u201cHave you told Trey yet?\u201d</p><p>Cary shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s the one sane thing I\u2019ve got going on right now. I lose him, I\u2019ll lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stayed with you so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have to work for it, Eva. Every day. I\u2019ve never worked so hard. And I\u2019m not talking about fucking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were.\u201d I pulled two clean bowls out of the dishwasher, along with spoons. \u201cWhat I think is that you\u2019re an amazing guy and anyone would be lucky to have you. I\u2019m pretty sure Trey feels the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please.\u201d His gaze met mine. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be real here. I don\u2019t need you to blow smoke at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Maybe what I said wasn\u2019t deep, but it\u2019s true.\u201d I paused in front of the rice cooker. \u201cGideon doesn\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on with him a lot of the time. He says he\u2019s trying to protect me, but what he\u2019s really doing is protecting himself.\u201d</p><p>And it took saying the words aloud to really make them sink in for me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid that the more he tells me, the more reason he gives me to walk away. But it\u2019s just the opposite, Cary. The more he doesn\u2019t say, the more I don\u2019t feel like he trusts me, and that\u2019s hurting us. You and Trey have been together as long as Gideon and I have.\u201d I reached out and touched his arm. \u201cYou have to tell him. If he finds out about the baby some other way\u2014and he will\u2014he might not forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Cary sagged against the island, suddenly looking so much older and so tired. \u201cI feel like if I just had more time to get a handle on things, I could deal with Trey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting isn\u2019t helping,\u201d I said gently, scooping rice into the bowls. \u201cYou\u2019re backsliding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else have I got?\u201d His voice came hard with anger. \u201cI don\u2019t fuck around anymore. A monk gets off more than I do.\u201d</p><p>I winced, knowing Cary was a man who exemplified what Dr. Petersen had talked about. When Cary had sex, he could turn his brain off and let his body make him feel good, if only for a little while. He didn\u2019t have to think or feel beyond the sensory. It was a coping mechanism he\u2019d had to perfect back when he was the one being fucked, long before he was old enough to even want to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me,\u201d I countered.</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, I love you, but you\u2019re not always what I need to get by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCutting yourself and banging everyone who\u2019ll let you isn\u2019t getting you by, either. They certainly don\u2019t help you feel good about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething has to.\u201d</p><p>I poured curry over the rice and passed the bowl over along with a spoon. \u201cTaking care of yourself will do it. Trusting the people you love will help, too. Being honest with yourself and with them. Sounds simple, but we both know it\u2019s not. Still, it\u2019s the only way, Cary.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a quick, sad smile and took the food I handed him. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d I said softly, returning his smile. \u201cThat was honest. Would it help if I\u2019m with you when you talk to Trey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll feel like a pussy for not doing it alone, but yeah, it\u2019d help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Cary caught me in a hug from behind, his cheek resting against my shoulder. \u201cYou really are always there for me. I love you for that.\u201d</p><p>Reaching back, I ran my fingers through his hair. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE comforter lifted away from my skin, waking me, and then the mattress shifted under the weight of the man sliding into my bed.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d</p><p>Eyes closed, I turned to him. Breathing deep, I inhaled the scent of his skin. My hands found the cool strength of his body, slid over him, pulled him close to warm him.</p><p>He took my mouth in a deep, urgent kiss. The shock of his hunger woke me the rest of the way; the greed in his touch sent my heart racing. He slid over me, then down, his mouth searing my nipples, then my belly, then my sex.</p><p>I gasped and arched. He tongued my clit with demanding focus, driving me higher, his hands pinning my hips as I writhed under the lash of his tongue.</p><p>I came hard, crying out. He wiped his lips on my inner thigh and rose, a seductive looming shadow in the dark of night. He mounted me, thrust hard inside me.</p><p>Over my moan, I heard him growl my name as if the pleasure of taking me were too great to bear. I gripped his waist; he gripped the sheets. His hips surged and rolled, stroking that magnificent penis deep and tirelessly inside me.</p><p>When I woke again the sun was up, and the place beside me in the bed was cold and empty.</p><p>17</p><p>I WAS FIXING a cup of coffee for Eva the next morning when my smartphone started ringing. Leaving the half-and-half on the counter, I crossed to the bar stool where I\u2019d hung my coat and pulled my phone out of the pocket.</p><p>Steeling myself, I answered, \u201cGood morning, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon. I\u2019m sorry to cancel on such short notice\u201d\u2014she took a shaky breath\u2014\u201cbut I won\u2019t be able to make lunch this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>I returned to my coffee, knowing I\u2019d need it for the long day ahead. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re relieved,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>I took a drink, wishing it were something stronger though it was barely past eight. \u201cDon\u2019t. If I didn\u2019t want to have lunch with you, I would\u2019ve canceled.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet a minute, then asked, \u201cHave you seen Chris lately?\u201d</p><p>I took another sip, my gaze on the hallway as I waited for Eva. \u201cI saw him Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat long ago?\u201d There was a note of fear in her voice. It gave me no pleasure to hear it.</p><p>Eva rushed into the living room in bare feet, her body encased in a pale beige sheath dress that managed to be professional while still hugging all her curves. I\u2019d picked it out for her knowing the color would showcase the color of her skin and the paleness of her hair.</p><p>Pleasure at the sight of her slid through my veins like the liquor I\u2019d wished were in my coffee. She could do that to me, intoxicate and captivate me.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never do.\u201d</p><p>I set my mug down to pick up Eva\u2019s. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it if I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, I shoved the phone in my pocket and handed the coffee to my wife. \u201cYou look stunning,\u201d I murmured, bending to press a kiss to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cFor a man who claims not to know a damn thing about women, you sure know how to dress one,\u201d she said, eyeing me over the lip of her mug as she took a sip.</p><p>A low moan of pleasure escaped her as she swallowed, a sound very similar to the one she made when I slid my cock inside her. Coffee, I\u2019d learned, was one of Eva\u2019s addictions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made mistakes, but I\u2019m learning.\u201d I leaned back against the counter and pulled her between my spread legs. Had she noticed one less Vera Wang dress in the closet? I\u2019d removed it from her wardrobe after realizing just how much of her luscious tits it exposed.</p><p>She held the mug up. \u201cThank you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d I brushed my fingertips across her cheek. \u201cI have to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What\u2019s up, ace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have a Google alert on me?\u201d</p><p>She looked into her mug. \u201cIs this when I should plead the Fifth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d I waited until she looked up at me again. \u201cCorinne has sold a book about our time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes darkened from pale gray to slate.</p><p>I cupped her nape and stroked over her racing pulse with my thumb. \u201cFrom what I read in the press release, she kept a diary during that time. She\u2019s also sharing personal photos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why would she sell that stuff for people to paw through?\u201d</p><p>The hand holding her mug trembled, so I took it from her and set it back on the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. However, if she lies outright and I can prove it, I can go after her for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only after it\u2019s released.\u201d Her hands came to rest on my chest. \u201cShe knows you\u2019ll have to read it. You\u2019ll have to see all the photos and read about how much she loves you. You\u2019ll read about things you did that you don\u2019t even remember now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it won\u2019t matter.\u201d I pressed my lips to her forehead. \u201cI never loved her, not the way I do you. Looking back on that time isn\u2019t going to make me suddenly wish I were with her and not you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t push you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot like I do.\u201d</p><p>I spoke against her skin, wishing I could press the words into her mind in a way that she would never doubt them. \u201cShe also didn\u2019t make me burn.

She leaned into me. \u201cThe hits just keep on coming, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>I looked over her head and out the window beyond, at the world that waited for us once we stepped outside. \u201cLet \u2019em come.\u201d</p> <p>She exhaled roughly. \u201cYeah, let \u2019em come.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I entered Tableau One and spotted Arnoldo immediately. Dressed in his pristinely white chef\u2019s jacket paired with black slacks, he stood by a small table for two in the back, talking to the woman I\u2019d come to see.</p><p>Her head turned toward me as I approached, her long dark hair sliding across her shoulder. Her blue eyes lit brightly for a moment when she spotted me, and then that light was quickly banked. Her smile when she greeted me was cool and more than a little smug.</p><p>\u201cCorinne.\u201d I greeted her with a nod before shaking hands with Arnoldo. The restaurant he ran and I backed was crowded with lunch guests, the buzz of numerous conversations loud enough to drown out the instrumental Italian-themed music piping through recessed speakers.</p> <p>Arnoldo excused himself to see to the kitchen, lifting Corinne\u2019s hand to his lips in farewell. Before he walked away, he shot me a look that I understood to mean we\u2019d talk later.</p><p>I took the seat across from Corinne. \u201cI appreciate your taking the time to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour invitation was a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it was unexpected.\u201d I leaned back, absorbing the soft lilt of Corinne\u2019s speech. While Eva\u2019s throaty voice stirred a deep craving, Corinne\u2019s had always soothed me.</p><p>Her smile widened as she brushed at an invisible speck on the plunging neckline of her red dress. \u201cNo, I suppose not.\u201d</p><p>Irritated by the game she was playing, I spoke curtly. \u201cWhat are you doing? You value your privacy as much as I do mine.\u201d</p> <p>Corinne\u2019s lips flattened into a firm line. \u201cI thought the exact same thing when I first saw that video of you and Eva arguing in the park. You say I don\u2019t know you, but I do, and having your private life splashed all over the tabloids isn\u2019t something you would ever allow under normal circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s normal?\u201d I shot back, unable to deny that I was a different man with Eva. I\u2019d never indulged women who tested me expecting some grand gesture. If they pursued me aggressively enough, I let them catch me for a night. With Eva, I\u2019d always been the one chasing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly my point\u2014you don\u2019t remember. Because you\u2019re wrapped up in a passionate affair and you can\u2019t see beyond it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing beyond it, Corinne. I will be with her until I die.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou think so now, but stormy relationships don\u2019t last, Gideon. They burn themselves out. You like order and calm, and you won\u2019t have that with her. Ever. Somewhere inside you, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Her words struck home. She had unwittingly echoed my own thoughts on the subject.</p><p>A server came by our table. Corinne ordered a salad; I ordered a drink\u2014a double.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve sold a tell-all to do . . . what?\u201d I asked, when the server walked away. \u201cGet back at me? Hurt Eva?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I want you to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the way?\u201d</p><p>I held her gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s over, Corinne. Exposing your memories of us isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d she conceded, sounding so sad it sent a pang of regret through me. \u201cBut you said you never loved me. At the very least, I\u2019ll prove that wrong. I gave you comfort. Contentment. You were happy with me. I don\u2019t see that same sort of tranquillity when you\u2019re with her. You can\u2019t tell me you feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you\u2019re saying tells me you don\u2019t care if I end up with you. But if you\u2019re leaving Giroux, maybe you care about the money. How much did they pay you to prostitute your \u2018love\u2019 for me?\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m writing the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to be sure I don\u2019t end up with Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want you to be happy, Gideon. And since you\u2019ve met her, I\u2019ve seen you be anything but.\u201d</p><p>How would Eva take the book when she read it? No better, I imagined, than I was taking \u201cGolden.\u201d</p><p>Corinne\u2019s gaze dropped to my left hand, which rested on the tabletop. \u201cYou gave Eva your mother\u2019s engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been hers for a long time.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of the wine she\u2019d had on the table when I joined her. \u201cDid you have it when you and I were together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell yourself that Eva and I are incompatible,\u201d I said tightly, \u201cthat we\u2019re either fighting or fucking with nothing of substance in between. But the truth is that she\u2019s the other half of me and what you\u2019re doing is going to hurt her, which will hurt me. I\u2019ll buy you out of the publishing contract if you\u2019ll withdraw the book.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me for a long minute. \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to let you go. This is a way for me to do that.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, Corinne, if you feel anything for me at all, to please drop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to turn what were good memories for me into something I hate.\u201d</p><p>Her turquoise eyes shone with tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I pushed back from the table and stood. \u201cYou will be.\u201d</p><p>Turning away, I walked out of the restaurant to the waiting Bentley. Angus opened the door, his gaze shifting to look beyond me into Tableau One\u2019s massive front window.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d I slid into the back. \u201cGod fucking damn it!\u201d</p><p>People who felt I\u2019d wronged them in some way were crawling out of the shadows like spiders, lured by the presence of Eva in my life.</p><p>She was my biggest vulnerability, one I wasn\u2019t hiding well. And that was becoming a problem I had to get a handle on. Christopher, Anne, Landon, Corinne . . . they were only the beginning. There were others who had grievances against me. Still more who held grudges toward my father.</p><p>I\u2019d long dared them all to come at me, enjoying the challenge. Now, the bastards were coming at me through my wife. All at once. And I was being stretched thin because of it. If I didn\u2019t have my guard up completely, my focus absolute, I would leave Eva open and unprotected.</p><p>Whatever I had to do, I had to prevent that.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cI still want to see you tonight,\u201d Eva said, her seductive voice drifting through the phone receiver like smoke.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not in question,\u201d I told her, leaning back in my desk chair. Outside the windows, the sun hung lower in the sky. The workday was over. Somewhere in the madness of the week, August had given way to September. \u201cYou deal with Cary, I\u2019ll sit down with Arnoldo, and you and I will start the weekend when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, this week just flew by. I need to work out. I skipped too many days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpar with me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d I thought of Eva in her sports bra and body-hugging pants, and my dick stirred with interest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight you!\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know too much. You\u2019re too good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put those self-defense skills of yours to the test, angel.\u201d The idea I\u2019d thrown out on a whim suddenly seemed like the best one I\u2019d had all day. \u201cI want to know you can take care of yourself in the unlikely case that you have to.\u201d</p><p>She never would, but it would give me peace of mind to know that she could get away from a threat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got wedding stuff tomorrow, but I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>I heard the car door open and Eva greet her doorman. She said hi to her concierge, and then I heard the ding of an arriving elevator in her lobby.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u201d\u2014she sighed\u2014\u201cI\u2019m putting on a brave face for Cary, but I\u2019m worried about what\u2019s going to happen with Trey. If he walks out, I think Cary just might totally self-destruct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asking a lot,\u201d I warned her, hearing another ding from the elevator. \u201cCary\u2019s basically telling this guy that he\u2019s got a pregnant sidepiece that he intends to hang on to. No, scratch that. He\u2019s saying that Trey is going to be the sidepiece. I can\u2019t see that going over well with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my phone on me all night. Call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always need you. I\u2019m home, so I have to go. See you later. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Would those words always hit me hard enough to steal my breath?</p><p>We hung up just as a familiar figure rounded the corner leading to my office. I stood as Mark Garrity reached my open doorway, and I met him halfway with my hand extended.</p><p>\u201cMark, thank you for making time for me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook my hand in a strong grip. \u201cI\u2019m the one feeling thankful, Mr. Cross. There are a large number of people in this city\u2014in the world, actually\u2014who\u2019d kill to be where I am right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Gideon, please.\u201d I gestured toward the seating area. \u201cHow\u2019s Steven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing great, thank you. I\u2019m beginning to think he missed a calling as a wedding planner.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cEva\u2019s about to dig into that this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Unbuttoning his suit jacket, Mark tugged up the legs of his slacks and sat on the sofa. His gray suit contrasted well with his dark skin and striped tie, pulling together the appearance of an urban professional on the rise.</p><p>\u201cIf she has half as much fun with it as Steven,\u201d he said, \u201cshe\u2019ll have the time of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope she doesn\u2019t have too much fun,\u201d I drawled, remaining on my feet. \u201cI\u2019d like to get past the planning and into the actual wedding.\u201d</p><p>Mark laughed.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll make this quick.\u201d I took a seat. \u201cI asked you to meet me after work, because it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to offer you a position with Cross Industries while you\u2019re on Waters Field and Leaman\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up.</p><p>I let that sink in for a second or two. \u201cCross Industries has a number of diverse international holdings, with a concentration on real estate, entertainment, and premium brands\u2014or assets we believe we can elevate to that status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Kingsman Vodka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. For the most part, advertising and marketing campaigns are managed on the ground level, but brand overhauls or adjustments to messaging are approved here. Due to the diversity I mentioned, we\u2019re always reviewing new strategies for rebranding or strengthening an established brand. We could use you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Mark rubbed his palms over his knees. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I was expecting, but this has caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you twice what you\u2019re making, to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a hell of an offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a man who likes the word no.\u201d</p><p>His grin flashed. \u201cI doubt you hear it very often. I guess this means Eva is leaving Waters Field and Leaman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t made that decision yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d His brows shot up again. \u201cIf I leave, she\u2019ll lose her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd gain another one here, of course.\u201d I kept my replies as brief and unrevealing as possible. I wanted his cooperation, not questions he might not like the answers to.</p><p>\u201cIs she waiting for me to agree before she takes any steps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour decision will be a catalyst.\u201d</p><p>Mark ran a hand over his tie. \u201cI\u2019m both flattered and excited, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s not a move you were planning on making,\u201d I interjected smoothly. \u201cYou\u2019re happy where you\u2019re at, and feel a measure of job security. So I\u2019m prepared to guarantee you the position\u2014and reasonable bonuses and annual raises\u2014for the next three years, barring any misconduct on your part.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, I set my fingers on the folder that Scott had left atop the table. I pushed it toward Mark. \u201cAll the information is laid out in detail in this. Take it home with you, discuss it with Steven, and let me know your decision on Monday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMonday?\u201d</p><p>I stood. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll want to give Waters Field and Leaman ample notice and I don\u2019t have a problem with that, but I\u2019ll need to have your commitment as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the folder and rose to his feet. \u201cWhat if I have questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me. My card is in the folder.\u201d I glanced at the watch on my wrist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have another appointment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d Mark accepted my extended hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This happened so fast I feel like I haven\u2019t quite processed it all yet. I understand you\u2019ve offered me a fantastic opportunity, though, and I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at what you do,\u201d I told him honestly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make the offer if you weren\u2019t worth it. Think about it, then say yes.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll give it some serious thought and you\u2019ll hear from me on Monday.\u201d</p><p>As he left, my head turned toward the building that housed LanCorp\u2019s headquarters. Landon wouldn\u2019t find me with my back turned again.</p><p>\u2014</p> <p>\u201cSHE started crying the minute you walked out.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Arnoldo over the rim of my tumbler, which held two fingers of scotch. I swallowed, then asked, \u201cDo you want me to feel guilty about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t feel sorry for her, either. But I thought you should know that Corinne isn\u2019t completely heartless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought she was. I just thought she\u2019d given that heart to her husband.\u201d</p><p>Arnoldo lifted one shoulder in a shrug. Dressed in well-worn jeans and a tucked-in white dress shirt that was open at the collar and rolled up at the cuffs, he was drawing a lot of female attention.</p><p>The bar was packed, but our section of the VIP balcony was guarded well, keeping the rest of the patrons at bay. Arnoldo sat on the crescent-shaped sofa where Cary had sat the first night I\u2019d met with Eva outside the Crossfire. The place would always hold strong memories because of her. It was that night when I realized she was changing everything.</p> <p>\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Arnoldo said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been one of those weeks.\u201d I caught his look. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to say, really. I should\u2019ve been smarter. I let the world see how much she means to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassionate kisses on the street, even more passionate fights in the park.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cWhat is it they say? Wearing your heart on your sleeve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI opened the door, now everyone wants to walk through it. She\u2019s the most direct way to fuck with my head, and everyone knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding Brett Kline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not an issue any longer.\u201d</p> <p>Arnoldo studied me and must have seen whatever he needed to. He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d I took another drink. \u201cWhat\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p><p>He waved off the question with a careless sweep of his hand, his gaze sliding around us to take in the women nearby who were swaying to the music of Lana Del Rey. \u201cThe restaurant is doing well, as you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m very pleased. Exceeded profit projections in every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just filmed some promotional teasers for the new season earlier this week. Once the Food Network starts airing them and the new episodes, we should see a nice boost in business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can always say I knew you when.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and clinked his glass to mine when I held it up in a toast.</p><p>We were back on track, which settled some of the unrest I\u2019d been feeling. I didn\u2019t lean on Arnoldo the way Eva leaned on her friends or Cary leaned on her, but Arnoldo was important to me all the same. I didn\u2019t have many people in my life who were close to me. Finding the rhythm he and I had lost was at least one major victory in a week that had seemed like a losing battle.</p><p>18</p><p>\u201cOH MY GOD,\u201d I moaned around a bite of chocolate toffee cupcake, \u201cthis is divine.\u201d</p><p>Kristin, the wedding planner, beamed. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites, too. Hold on, though. The butter vanilla is even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanilla over chocolate?\u201d My gaze slid over the yummies on the coffee table. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would usually agree,\u201d Kristin said, making a note, \u201cbut this bakery made me a convert. The lemon is also very good.\u201d</p><p>The early-afternoon light poured in through the massive windows that made up one side of my mother\u2019s private sitting room, illuminating her pale gold curls and porcelain skin. She\u2019d redecorated recently, opting for soft gray-blue walls that lent a new energy to the space\u2014and complemented her well.</p><p>It was one of her talents, showcasing herself in the best light. It was also one of her major flaws, in my opinion. She cared so damn much about appearances.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand how my mom could not get bored with decorating to the latest trends, even if it did seem to take over a year to cycle through every room and hallway in Stanton\u2019s six-thousand-plus-square-foot penthouse.</p><p>My one meeting with Blaire Ash had been enough to tell me that the decorating gene had skipped my generation. I\u2019d been interested in his ideas but couldn\u2019t get worked up over the details.</p><p>While I popped another mini cupcake into my mouth with my fingers, my mother daintily speared one of the coin-sized cakes with a fork.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your floral arrangement preferences?\u201d Kristin asked, uncrossing and recrossing long, coffee-hued legs. Her Jimmy Choo heels were elegant but still sexy; her Diane von Furstenberg wrap dress was vintage and classic. She wore her shoulder-length dark hair in tight curls that framed and flattered her narrow face, and pale pink gloss highlighted full, wide lips.</p><p>She looked fierce and fabulous, and I\u2019d liked her the moment we met.</p><p>\u201cRed,\u201d I said, wiping frosting from the corner of my mouth. \u201cAnything red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed?\u201d My mother gave an emphatic shake of her head. \u201cHow garish, Eva. It\u2019s your first wedding. Go with white, cream, and gold.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cHow many weddings do you expect me to have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. You\u2019re a first-time bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about wearing a red dress,\u201d I argued. \u201cI\u2019m just saying the primary accent color should be red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that will work, honey. And I\u2019ve put together enough weddings to know.\u201d</p><p>I remembered my mother going through the wedding planning process before, each successive nuptial more elaborate and memorable than the last. Never overdone and always tasteful. Beautiful weddings for a youthful, beautiful bride. I hoped I aged with half as much grace, because Gideon was only going to get hotter as time went on. He was just that kind of man.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you what red can look like, Monica,\u201d Kristin said, pulling a leather portfolio out of her bag. \u201cRed can be amazing, especially with evening weddings. The important thing is that the ceremony and reception represent both the bride and groom. To have a truly memorable day, it\u2019s important that we visually convey their style, history, and hopes for the future.\u201d</p><p>My mother accepted the extended portfolio and glanced at the collage of photos on the page. \u201cEva . . . you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>I shot a look of appreciation at Kristin for having my back, especially when she\u2019d come on board expecting my mother to be footing the bill. Of course, the fact that I was marrying Gideon Cross probably helped sway her to my side. Using him as a future reference would certainly help her draw new clientele.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a compromise, Mom.\u201d At least I hoped so. I hadn\u2019t dropped the biggest bomb on her yet.</p><p>\u201cDo we have an idea of the budget?\u201d Kristin asked.</p><p>And there it was . . .</p><p>I saw my mom\u2019s mouth open in slow motion and my heart lurched into a semipanicked beat. \u201cFifty thousand for the ceremony itself,\u201d I blurted out. \u201cMinus the cost of the dress.\u201d</p><p>Both women turned wide eyes toward me.</p><p>My mom gave an incredulous laugh, her hand lifting to touch the Cartier trinity necklace that hung between her breasts. \u201cMy God, Eva. What a time to make jokes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s paying for the wedding, Mom,\u201d I told her, my voice strengthening now that the moment I\u2019d dreaded had passed.</p><p>She blinked at me, her blue eyes revealing\u2014just for an instant\u2014a sweet softening. Then her jaw tightened. \u201cYour dress alone will cost more than that. The flowers, the venue . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married on the beach,\u201d I said, the idea just coming to me. \u201cNorth Carolina. The Outer Banks. At the house Gideon and I just bought. We\u2019ll only need enough flowers for the members of the wedding party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d My mom glanced at Kristin for support. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that would work. You\u2019d have no control.\u201d</p><p>Meaning she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cUnpredictable weather,\u201d she went on, \u201csand everywhere . . . Plus, asking everyone to travel that far out of the city will make it likely some won\u2019t be able to attend. And where would everyone stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s everyone? I told you, the ceremony is going to be small, for friends and family only. Gideon\u2019s taking care of travel. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to take care of lodging arrangements, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that,\u201d Kristin said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her!\u201d my mother snapped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rude!\u201d I shot back. \u201cI think you\u2019re forgetting that it\u2019s my wedding. Not a publicity op.\u201d</p><p>My mom took a deep, steadying breath. \u201cEva, I think it\u2019s very sweet that you want to accommodate your father this way, but he doesn\u2019t understand what a burden he\u2019s placing on you by asking this. Even if I matched him dollar for dollar, it wouldn\u2019t be enough\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plenty.\u201d My hands linked tightly together in my lap, pressing the rings on my fingers uncomfortably against the bone. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to offend people. You have to understand that a man in Gideon\u2019s position needs to take every opportunity to solidify his network. He\u2019s going to want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014to elope,\u201d I bit out, frustrated by the too-familiar clash of our viewpoints. \u201cIf he had his way, we\u2019d run off somewhere and get married on a remote beach with a couple of witnesses and a great view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may say that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mother. Trust me. That\u2019s exactly what he would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, if I may.\u201d Kristin leaned forward. \u201cWe can make this work, Monica. Many celebrity weddings are private affairs. A limited budget will keep us focused on the details. And, if Gideon and Eva are open to it, we can arrange to have select photographs sold to the celebrity lifestyle magazines, with the profits going to charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like that!\u201d I said, even as I wondered how that could work with the forty-eight-hour exclusive deal Gideon had offered Deanna Johnson.</p><p>My mom looked distraught. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of your wedding since the day you were born,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI always wanted you to have something fit for a princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d I reached over and took her hand in mine. \u201cYou can go wild with the reception, okay? Do whatever you want. Skip the red, invite the world, whatever. As for the wedding, isn\u2019t it enough that I found my prince?\u201d</p><p>Her hand tightened on mine and she looked at me with tears in her blue eyes. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I\u2019D just slid into the back of the Benz when my smartphone started ringing. Pulling it out of my purse, I looked at the screen and saw it was Trey. My stomach twisted a little.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get the shattered look on his face last night out of my mind. I\u2019d stayed tucked away in the kitchen while Cary sat with Trey in the living room and told him about Tatiana and the baby. I had put a pot roast in the oven and sat at the breakfast bar with my tablet, reading a book while staying in Cary\u2019s line of sight. Even in profile, I could see how hard Trey had taken the news.</p><p>Still, he\u2019d stayed for dinner and then overnight, so I hoped things would work out in the end. At least he hadn\u2019t just walked out.</p><p>\u201cHi, Trey,\u201d I answered. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Eva.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cI have no idea how I am. How are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m just leaving my mother\u2019s place after spending hours talking about the wedding. It didn\u2019t go as badly as it could have, but it could\u2019ve been smoother. But that\u2019s pretty usual when dealing with my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . well, you\u2019ve got a lot on your plate. I\u2019m sorry to bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrey. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m glad you called. If you want to talk, I\u2019m here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould we get together, maybe? Whenever it\u2019s convenient for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m at a street fair on the west side. My sister dragged me out and I was miserable company. She ditched me a few minutes ago and now I\u2019m wondering what the hell I\u2019m doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m between Eighty-second and Eighty-third, close to Amsterdam. It\u2019s packed here, just FYI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, hang tight. I\u2019ll see you in a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Eva.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I caught Ra\u00fal\u2019s gaze in the rearview mirror. \u201cAmsterdam and Eighty-second. Close as you can get.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I looked out the window as we turned a corner, taking in the city on a sunny Saturday afternoon.</p><p>The pace of Manhattan was slower on the weekends, the clothes more casual, and the street vendors more plentiful. Women in sandals and light summer dresses window-shopped leisurely, while men in shorts and T-shirts traveled in groups, taking in the women and discussing whatever it was men discussed. Dogs of all sizes pranced on the ends of leashes, while children in strollers kicked up their heels or napped. An elderly couple shuffled along hand in hand, still lost in the wonder of each other after years of familiarity.</p><p>I was speed-dialing Gideon before I realized I\u2019d thought of it.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he answered. \u201cAre you on your way home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite. I\u2019m done at my mom\u2019s, but I\u2019m going to meet Trey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will that take?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Not more than an hour, I think. God, I hope he doesn\u2019t tell me he\u2019s done with Cary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it go with your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her we were getting married on the beach by the Outer Banks house.\u201d I paused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve asked you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d His raspy voice took on the special timbre that told me he was moved.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me how we\u2019re planning on lodging everyone. I kinda dropped that on you and the wedding planner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>Love for him spread through me in a warm rush. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the big hurdle\u2019s behind you,\u201d he said, understanding as he so often did.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that. She got all teary about it. You know, she had big dreams that aren\u2019t coming true. I hope she lets them go and gets on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her family? We haven\u2019t talked about making arrangements for them to come.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, then remembered he couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cThey\u2019re not invited. The only things I know about them are what I found with a Google search. They disowned my mom when she got pregnant with me, so they\u2019ve never been a part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d My mood instantly brightened. \u201cWill you give me a hint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. You\u2019ll have to hurry home if you\u2019re curious.\u201d</p><p>I pouted. \u201cTease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeases don\u2019t deliver. I do.\u201d</p><p>My toes curled at the rough velvet of his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll be home as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE traffic near the fair was impossible. Ra\u00fal left the Benz in the garage beneath my apartment building, then walked me over to the street fair.</p><p>When we were half a block away, I started smelling the food and my mouth watered. Music drifted in the air and when we reached Amsterdam Avenue, I saw that it came from a woman singing on a small stage for a packed audience.</p><p>Vendors lined either side of the overflowing street, their wares and heads shielded from the sun by white tent tops. From scarves and hats, to jewelry and art, to fresh produce and multinational eats, there was nothing one could want that couldn\u2019t be found.</p><p>It took me a few minutes to spot Trey in the crowd. I found him sitting on steps not too far from the corner we\u2019d agreed upon. He was dressed in loose jeans and an olive-hued T-shirt, with sunglasses perched on the crooked bridge of his once-broken nose. His blond hair was as unruly as ever, his attractive mouth tightened into a firm line.</p><p>He stood when he saw me, holding out his hand for me to shake. I pulled him into a hug instead, holding him until I felt him relax and hug me back. Life flowed by around us\u2014New Yorkers were comfortable with all sorts of public displays. Ra\u00fal moved a discreet distance away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking mess,\u201d Trey muttered against my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re normal.\u201d I pulled back and gestured toward the steps where I\u2019d found him. \u201cAnyone would be reeling right now.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the middle step. I perched next to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this, Eva. I don\u2019t think I should. I want someone in my life full-time, someone who\u2019s there to support me while I get through school, then try to build my practice. Cary\u2019s going to be supporting that model instead and fitting me in when he can. How am I not going to resent that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a valid question,\u201d I said, stretching out my legs in front of me. \u201cYou know Cary won\u2019t be sure the baby is his until a paternity test is done.\u201d</p><p>Trey shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll matter. He seems invested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll matter. Maybe he won\u2019t just walk away, maybe he\u2019ll play uncle or something. I don\u2019t know. For now, we have to go with the assumption that he\u2019s the dad, but maybe he\u2019s not. It\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me to hang in there for another six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If you want me to give you answers, I don\u2019t have any. All I can tell you for sure is that Cary loves you, more than I\u2019ve ever seen him love anyone. If he loses you, it\u2019s going to break him. I\u2019m not trying to guilt you into staying with him. I just think you should know that if you leave, you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019ll be hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not.\u201d I set my hand on his knee. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just small enough to find that comforting. If Gideon and I didn\u2019t work out, I\u2019d want to know he was as miserable as I was.\u201d</p><p>Trey\u2019s mouth curved in a sad smile. \u201cYeah, I see your point. Would you stay with him if you found out he\u2019d knocked someone else up? Someone he was sleeping with while dating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about that. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine not being with Gideon. If we weren\u2019t exclusive at the time and the woman was in his past, if he was with me and not her, maybe I could handle it.\u201d</p><p>I watched a woman hang yet another bag of purchases onto the overburdened handle of her kid\u2019s stroller. \u201cBut if he was mostly with her and seeing me on the side . . . I think I\u2019d walk.\u201d</p><p>It was tough being honest when the truth was the opposite of what Cary would want me to say, but I felt like it was the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I wouldn\u2019t think less of you if you toughed it out with Cary. It\u2019s not weak to stand by the person you love when they\u2019re trying to fix a big mistake, and it\u2019s not weak to decide to put yourself first. Whatever decision you make, I\u2019ll still think you\u2019re a helluva guy.\u201d</p><p>Leaning into me, he rested his head on my shoulder. \u201cThanks, Eva.\u201d</p><p>I linked my fingers with his. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019LL go get the car and pull it around,\u201d Ra\u00fal said, as we entered the lobby of my apartment building.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m just going to check the mail.\u201d I waved at the concierge as we passed the desk. I turned into the mailroom, while Ra\u00fal headed to the elevator.</p><p>Sliding my key into the lock, I pulled the brass door open and bent low to peer inside. There were a few postcard advertisements and nothing else, which saved me a trip upstairs. I slid them out, tossed them in the nearby trash can, then shut and locked the mailbox.</p><p>I headed back into the lobby just in time to catch a woman exiting the building. Her spiky red hair caught my attention and held it. I stared hard, waiting for her to turn onto the street, hoping I\u2019d catch a glimpse of her profile.</p><p>My breath caught. The hair was familiar from a Google image search. The face I remembered from the shelter fund-raiser Gideon and I had attended a few weeks back.</p><p>Then she was gone.</p><p>I ran after her, but when I reached the sidewalk she was already sliding into the back of a black town car.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>The car sped off, leaving me staring after it.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d</p><p>I turned to face Louie, the weekend doorman. \u201cDo you know who that was?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t live here.\u201d</p><p>Going back inside, I asked the concierge the same question.</p><p>\u201cA redhead?\u201d she asked, looking perplexed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any visitors who came in without a tenant today, so I haven\u2019t really paid attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Okay, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour car\u2019s here, Eva,\u201d Louie said from the doorway.</p><p>I thanked the concierge and headed out to Ra\u00fal. I spent the ride between my place and Gideon\u2019s thinking about Anne Lucas. By the time I stepped out of the private elevator into the foyer of the penthouse, my spinning thoughts had me distracted.</p><p>Gideon was waiting for me. Dressed in worn jeans and a Columbia T-shirt, he looked so young and handsome. Then he flashed me a smile and I almost forgot the world altogether.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he purred, crossing the black-and-white checkerboard flooring on bare feet. He had that look in his eye I knew well. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I walked right into his open arms, cuddling up tightly to his hard body. I breathed him in. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m crazy,\u201d I mumbled against his chest, \u201cbut I could swear I just saw Anne Lucas in the lobby of my building.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. I knew the shrink wasn\u2019t his favorite person.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes ago, maybe. Right before I came over here.\u201d</p><p>Releasing me, he reached into his back pocket and pulled out his smartphone. His other hand caught mine and pulled me into the living room.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cross just saw Anne Lucas in her apartment building,\u201d he said to whoever answered.</p><p>\u201cI think I did,\u201d I corrected, frowning at his hard tone.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t listening to me. \u201cFind out,\u201d he ordered, before hanging up.</p><p>\u201cGideon. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He led us to the couch and sat. I settled next to him, putting my purse down on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI saw Anne the other day,\u201d he explained, holding on to my hand. \u201cRa\u00fal confirmed that the woman who spoke to you at the fund-raiser was her. She admitted it, and I warned her to stay away from you, but she won\u2019t. She wants to hurt me and she knows she can do that if she hurts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I processed that.</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell Ra\u00fal the moment you see her anywhere. Even if you just think it\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute, ace. You went to see her the other day and didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me then?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled roughly. \u201cIt was the day Chris came over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I gnawed on my lower lip a minute. \u201cHow would she hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s enough for me that she wants to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike would she break my leg? My nose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she\u2019d resort to violence,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cIt would be more fun for her to play mind games. Showing up where you are. Letting you catch glimpses of her.\u201d</p><p>Which was more insidious. \u201cSo that you\u2019ll go to her. That\u2019s what she really wants,\u201d I muttered. \u201cShe wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be obliging her. I said what I needed to.\u201d</p><p>Looking down at our joined hands, I played with his wedding band. \u201cAnne, Corinne, Deanna . . . It\u2019s a bit crazy, Gideon. I mean, I don\u2019t think this is normal for most men. How many more women are going to lose their minds over you?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a look that was patently not amused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gotten into Corinne. None of what she\u2019s done since she returned to New York is like her. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the medication she was on, the miscarriage, her divorce . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting divorced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take that tone, Eva. It doesn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to me if she\u2019s married or single. I\u2019m married. That\u2019s never going to change, and I\u2019m not a man who cheats. I have more respect for you\u2014and me\u2014than to be that kind of husband.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned forward, offering my mouth, and he took it in a soft, sweet kiss. He had said exactly what I needed to hear.</p><p>Gideon pulled back, nuzzling his nose against mine. \u201cAs for the other two . . . You have to understand that Deanna was collateral damage. Fuck. My entire life has been a war zone and some people have gotten caught in the line of fire.\u201d</p><p>I cupped his jaw, trying to stroke the tension away with soothing brushes of my thumb. I knew just what he meant.</p><p>He swallowed hard. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t used Deanna to send a message to Anne that the door was closed between us, she would\u2019ve been just a one-night stand. Over and done with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s okay now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d His fingertips brushed my cheek, the touch reflecting the one I\u2019d given him. \u201cSince I\u2019m sharing, I\u2019ll say that I don\u2019t think she\u2019d turn me down if I tried to hook up\u2014which I won\u2019t\u2014but I don\u2019t think she falls in the woman-scorned category any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I knew she\u2019d hit the sheets with you again if she could. Not that I blame her. Do you have to be so damn good in bed? Isn\u2019t it enough that you\u2019re hot, and have an amazing body and a huge cock?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, clearly exasperated. \u201cIt\u2019s not huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You\u2019re hung. And you know how to use it. And women don\u2019t get awesome sex very often, so when we do, we can go a little nuts over it. I guess that answers my question about Anne, since she had you repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never had me.\u201d Gideon sat back, slouching. Scowling. \u201cAt some point you\u2019re going to get sick of hearing what an asshole I am.\u201d</p><p>I curled into his side, resting my head on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first insanely hot guy on the planet to use women. And you won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was different with Anne,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about her husband.\u201d</p><p>I stilled, then forced myself to relax so that I didn\u2019t make him any more nervous than he already was.</p><p>He sucked in a quick, deep breath. \u201cShe reminds me of Hugh sometimes,\u201d he said in a rush. \u201cThe way she moves, some of the things she says . . . There\u2019s a familial resemblance. And more. I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes the line between them blurred in my mind. It was like I was punishing Hugh through Anne. I did things to her I\u2019ve never done with anyone else. Things that made me feel sick when I thought about them later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d I slid my arm around his waist.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told me this. He\u2019d said before that it was Dr. Terrence Lucas he was punishing, and I was sure that was part of it. But now I knew it wasn\u2019t all of it.</p><p>Gideon sat back. \u201cIt was twisted between Anne and me. I twisted her. If I could go back and do things differently\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it. I\u2019m glad you told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to. Listen, angel, you need to tell Ra\u00fal the moment you see her anywhere. Even if you\u2019re not sure. And don\u2019t go anywhere alone. I\u2019ll figure out how to deal with her. In the meantime, I need to know that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how that plan would work over the long haul. We lived in the same city with the woman and her husband, and Lucas himself had approached me before. They were a problem and we needed a solution.</p><p>But we weren\u2019t going to come up with it today. Saturday. One of the two days of the week I most looked forward to because I got to spend so much private time with my husband.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d I began, sliding my hand up beneath Gideon\u2019s shirt to touch his warm skin. \u201cWhere\u2019s my surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d The sexy rasp in his voice deepened. \u201cLet\u2019s wait a bit before that. How about we start with some wine?\u201d</p><p>Tilting my head back, I looked up at him. \u201cAre you trying to seduce me, ace?\u201d</p><p>He kissed my nose. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm . . . Go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>I knew something was up when Gideon didn\u2019t join me in the shower. The only time he missed an opportunity to put his hands on me while drenched and dripping was in the mornings, after he\u2019d already had his way with me.</p><p>When I came back out to the living room dressed in shorts and tank top sans bra, he was waiting for me with a glass of red wine. We settled on the couch with 3 Days to Kill, which only proved to me that my husband knew me well. It was just the sort of movie I enjoyed\u2014a bit funny, a lot over-the-top. And it had Kevin Costner, who was always a win for me.</p><p>Still, as much fun as I had just being lazy with Gideon, the anticipation started to make me twitchy as the hours passed. And Gideon, the devious man, knew it. He built on it. He kept my wineglass full and his hands on me\u2014tangled in my hair, brushing over my shoulder, running along my thigh.</p><p>By nine o\u2019clock, I was crawling all over him. I slid into his lap and pressed my lips to his throat, my tongue darting out to stroke over his pulse. I felt it leap, then accelerate, but he made no move in response. He sat as if absorbed in the rerun we\u2019d channel-surfed to after the movie ended.</p><p>\u201cGideon?\u201d I whispered in my fuck-me voice, my hand sliding between his legs to find him as hard and ready as always.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>I caught the lobe of his ear in my teeth, tugging gently. \u201cWould you mind if I fucked myself on your big cock while you\u2019re watching TV?\u201d</p><p>His hand rubbed absently down my back. \u201cI might not be able to see around you,\u201d he replied, sounding distracted. \u201cMaybe you better get on your knees and suck it instead.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, I gaped at him. His eyes laughed at me.</p><p>I shoved at his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy poor angel,\u201d he crooned. \u201cAre you horny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I gestured at my chest. My nipples were hard and tight, straining against the thin cotton in a silent demand for his attention.</p><p>Cupping my shoulders, he pulled me closer and caught the tip of my breast in his teeth, his tongue stroking softly. I moaned.</p><p>He released me, his eyes now so dark they were like sapphires. \u201cAre you wet?\u201d</p><p>I was getting there, fast. Whenever Gideon looked at me like that, my body softened for him, grew moist and eager. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you find out?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>The authoritative bite in his command made me hotter. I slid off him carefully, feeling inexplicably shy. He pushed the coffee table back with one foot, giving me more room to stand in front of him. His gaze slid over me, his face expressionless. The lack of encouragement made me even more anxious, which I guessed was his intention.</p><p>He was pushing in that way he had.</p><p>Rolling my shoulders back, I caught his gaze with my own and ran my tongue along my bottom lip. His eyes became heavy-lidded. I slid my thumbs beneath the elastic waistband of my athletic shorts and pushed them down, wriggling my hips a little to make it look more like a striptease and less like I was feeling awkward.</p><p>\u201cNo panties,\u201d he murmured, his gaze on my sex. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad girl, angel.\u201d</p><p>I pouted. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen yourself for me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLet me see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon . . .\u201d</p><p>He waited patiently and I knew that patience would hold. Whether it took me five minutes or five hours, he would wait for me. And that was why I trusted him. Because it was never a question of whether I would submit, but when I was ready to, and that was a decision he most often left to me.</p><p>I widened my stance and tried to slow the quickness of my breathing. Reaching down with both hands, I touched the lips of my sex and spread them, exposing my clit to the man it ached for.</p><p>Gideon straightened slowly. \u201cYou have such a pretty cunt, Eva.\u201d</p><p>As he leaned closer, I held my breath. His hands lifted from his thighs, reaching for mine to hold me steady. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Then he licked me in a leisurely glide.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d I moaned, my legs shaking.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said hoarsely, sliding to his knees on the floor as I obeyed.</p><p>The glass was cool against my bare buttocks, a sharp contrast to the heat of my skin. My arms stretched back, gripping the far edge of the table for balance as he pressed my thighs wide with his palms, splaying me open.</p><p>His breath was hot against my damp flesh, his focus fully on my sex. \u201cYou could be wetter.\u201d</p><p>I watched, panting, as he lowered his head and wrapped his lips around my clit. The heat was searing, the lash of his tongue devastating. I cried out, wanting to writhe but held fast by his grip. My head fell back, my ears ringing with the rush of blood and the sound of Gideon\u2019s groan. His tongue fluttered over the tight bundle of nerves, driving me relentlessly toward orgasm. My stomach tightened as the pleasure built, the soft silk of his hair brushing along my sensitive inner thighs.</p><p>A low moan escaped me. \u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I gasped. \u201cGideon . . . God . . . I\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>He drove his tongue inside me. My elbows weakened, dropping me lower. His tongue fucked into the clutching opening of my sex, stroking through the sensitive tissues, teasing me with a promise of the penetration I truly craved.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d I begged.</p><p>Gideon pulled back, licking his lips. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>I made a sound of protest as he stood, so close to orgasm I could taste it. He held his hand out to me, helped me straighten and then stand. When I wobbled, he caught me up, tossing me over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGideon!\u201d</p><p>But then his hand was between my legs, massaging my wet, swollen sex, and I didn\u2019t care how he carried me, as long as he got me someplace where he\u2019d take me.</p><p>We reached the hallway and turned, then stopped too quickly to have reached his bedroom. I heard the doorknob turn and then the light flicked on.</p><p>We were in the bedroom that was mine. He set me down on my feet, facing him.</p><p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d I asked. Maybe some men would head to the nearest bed, but Gideon had more control than that. If he wanted me in the second bedroom, he had a reason for it.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Something about his voice . . . the way he looked at me . . .</p><p>I looked over my shoulder.</p><p>And saw the swing.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>IT wasn\u2019t what I expected.</p><p>I\u2019d looked up sex swings on the Internet when Gideon had first mentioned one. What I\u2019d found were rickety things you hung from door frames, not-so-rickety things that hung from four-legged frames, and ones that hung from an eyebolt in the ceiling. All of them consisted of some combination of chains and/or straps that acted as slings for various body parts. Pictures of women actually harnessed in the damn things looked uncomfortable.</p><p>Honestly, I couldn\u2019t see how anyone could get past the awkwardness and fear of collapse, let alone manage an orgasm.</p><p>I should\u2019ve known Gideon would have something else in mind.</p><p>Turning, I faced the swing head-on. Gideon had cleared out the bedroom at some point. The bed and furnishings were gone. The only object in the room was the swing itself, suspended from a sturdy cagelike structure. A wide, solid metal platform anchored steel sides and roof, which supported the weight of a padded metal chair and chains. Red leather cuffs for wrists and ankles hung in the appropriate places.</p><p>His arms wrapped around me from behind, one hand sliding up beneath my shirt to cup my breast, while the other slid between my legs to push two fingers inside me.</p><p>Nuzzling my hair out of the way, he kissed my throat. \u201cHow do you feel, looking at that?\u201d</p><p>I thought about it. \u201cIntrigued. A little apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved against my skin. \u201cLet\u2019s see how you feel once you\u2019re in it.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of expectation and apprehension moved through me. I could see from the position of the cuffs that I would be helpless, unable to move or pull away. Unable to exert any control whatsoever over what might happen to me.</p><p>\u201cI want to do this right, Eva. Not like that night in the elevator. I want you to feel it when I\u2019m in control and we\u2019re in it together.\u201d</p><p>My head fell back against him. Somehow, it was harder giving the consent he wanted. There was less . . . responsibility when he just took charge.</p><p>But that was a cop-out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your safe word, angel?\u201d he murmured, his teeth scoring gently across my throat. His hands were magic, his fingers gliding shallowly inside me.</p><p>\u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the word and everything stops. Say it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrossfire.\u201d</p><p>His dexterous fingers tugged at my nipple, milking it expertly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. You just have to sit back and take my cock. I\u2019m going to make you come without you having to do a thing.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s always how it is between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it this way,\u201d he coaxed, his hands moving to pull my shirt off. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll hit the bed instead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment, I wanted to delay, take more time to let it all settle in. I\u2019d promised the swing, but he wasn\u2019t holding that over me . . .</p><p>\u201cCrossfire,\u201d he breathed, hugging me from behind.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know if he was reminding me of my safe word or telling me he loved me so much there were no words for how he felt. Either way, the effect on me was the same. I felt safe.</p><p>I also felt his excitement. His breathing had quickened the moment I\u2019d spotted the swing. His erection was like steel against my buttocks and his skin was hot against mine. His desire spurred my own, made me want to do whatever it took to give him as much pleasure as he could stand.</p><p>If he needed something, I wanted to be the woman who gave it to him. He gave so much to me. Everything.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said softly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my shoulder, then stepped beside me, taking my hand in his.</p><p>I followed him to the swing, studying it intently. The narrow seat hung at waist level for Gideon, which meant he had to turn me to face him, then lift me up into the chair. His mouth touched mine as my bare ass touched the cool leather, his tongue teasing the seam of my lips. I shivered. Whether that was from the chill, his kiss, or anxiety, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Gideon pulled away, his gaze heavy-lidded and hot. He eased me into position, holding the chains steady as I leaned into the seat back, which was angled away from him, making me want to stretch my legs out for balance.</p><p>\u201cYou settled?\u201d he asked, watching me intently.</p><p>I knew the question was about more than my physical comfort. I nodded.</p><p>He stepped back, his gaze never leaving my face. \u201cI\u2019m going to secure your ankles. You tell me if anything doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d My voice was breathy, my pulse racing.</p><p>His hand slid down my leg, the stroke warm and provocative. I couldn\u2019t look away as he wrapped the crimson leather around my ankle and cinched the metal buckle. The cuff was fit securely but not too tightly.</p><p>Gideon moved quickly and confidently. A moment later, my other leg was suspended as well.</p><p>He looked at me. \u201cOkay so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done this before.\u201d I pouted. His actions seemed too practiced to be those of a beginner.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Instead he began to strip as slowly and methodically as he\u2019d restrained me.</p><p>Mesmerized, I greedily drank in every inch of skin he revealed. My husband had such an amazing body. He was so hard and tight, so virile. It was impossible not to become aroused seeing him naked.</p><p>His tongue slid along the bottom curve of his mouth in a leisurely, erotic caress. \u201cStill good, angel?\u201d</p><p>Gideon knew exactly what the sight of him did to me, and it turned me on even more that he was arrogant enough to use that weakness against me. God knew I did the same to him when I could.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucking hot,\u201d I told him, licking my own lips.</p><p>He smiled and came toward me, his thick, long cock curving upward to his navel. \u201cI think you\u2019ll really enjoy this.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have to ask why he said so, because it was evident as he reached me and took my hands in his. My vantage of him from the swing seat was completely unhindered. From the thighs upward, he was totally exposed between the spread of my legs.</p><p>He bent and kissed me again. Softly. Sweetly. I moaned at the unexpected tenderness and the lushness of his flavor.</p><p>Releasing one of my hands, he reached between us, gripping his cock and angling it downward to stroke between the lips of my sex. The wide head slid through the slickness of my desire, then nudged against my exposed clit. Pleasure rippled through me and I discovered just how vulnerable I was. I couldn\u2019t arch my hips. I couldn\u2019t tighten my inner muscles to chase the sensation.</p><p>A low whimper escaped me. I needed more, but could only wait for him to give it to me.</p><p>\u201cYou trust me,\u201d he whispered against my mouth.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question, but I answered anyway. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gideon nodded. \u201cGrab the chains.\u201d</p><p>There were wrist restraints above my head. I wondered why he didn\u2019t use them, but I trusted him to know best. If he didn\u2019t think I was ready, it was because he knew me so well. In some ways, he knew me better than I knew myself.</p><p>The love I felt for him unfurled in my chest until it filled me, pushing aside the vestiges of fear that hovered in the dark corners of my mind. I\u2019d never felt so close to him, never known it was possible to believe in someone so completely.</p><p>I did as Gideon ordered and gripped the chains. He stepped close again, his abs glistening with the first mist of perspiration. I could see his pulse throbbing in his neck, his arms, his penis. His heart was racing like mine. The head of his cock was as wet with excitement as my sex. The hunger between us was a living thing in the room, sliding sinuously around us, narrowing the world to just the two of us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d he ordered, waiting until I nodded my agreement before he proceeded.</p><p>He gripped a chain where it met with the seat. His other hand guided his cock to my cleft. The thick crown pressed teasingly against me, taunting me with the promise of pleasure. I was panting as I waited for him to take the step forward that would slide him into me, my core aching with the need to be filled.</p><p>Instead, he gripped the seat of the chair in both hands and pulled me onto his cock.</p><p>The sound that ripped from my throat was inhuman, the savagely erotic feeling of being so deeply penetrated driving me wild. He sank deep in that one easy glide, my body unable to offer any resistance.</p><p>Gideon snarled, a tremor running through his powerful body. \u201cFuck,\u201d he hissed. \u201cYour cunt is so good.\u201d</p><p>I started to reach for him, but he pushed the swing back, gliding me off his rock-hard erection. The feeling of being emptied made me moan in distress.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged softly.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to let go,\u201d he said, with a wicked gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I promised, gripping the chains so hard it hurt.</p><p>His arms flexed as he pulled me back, sliding me onto his cock. My toes curled. The feeling of weightlessness, of total surrender, was indescribable.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he bit out. \u201cTell me you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I gasped, feeling sweat slide down my nape. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>One moment I was held stationary, the next I was swinging fluidly, my sex sliding on and off Gideon\u2019s rigid cock with breathtaking speed. His body worked like a well-oiled machine, his arms, chest, abs, and thighs straining with the exertion of masterfully handling the swing. The sight of his powerful movements, the intensity of his focus on pleasuring us both, the feel of him pumping so deep and fast into me . . .</p><p>I orgasmed with a scream, unable to contain the rush that surged through me. He fucked me through it, growling roughly, his face flushed and etched with lust. I\u2019d never come so hard, so fast. I couldn\u2019t see or breathe for an endless moment, my body wracked by a pleasure more ferocious than any I\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>The swing slowed, then stopped. Gideon took an extra step toward me that kept him buried inside me. He smelled decadent, primal. Pure sin and sex.</p><p>His hands cupped my face. His fingers brushed tendrils of hair off my damp cheeks. My sex spasmed around him, all too aware of how hard and thick he still was.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come,\u201d I accused, feeling far too vulnerable after the insanity of my orgasm.</p><p>Gideon took my mouth in a harsh, demanding kiss. \u201cI\u2019m going to restrain your wrists. Then I\u2019m going to come in you.\u201d</p><p>My nipples tightened into painful points. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust me,\u201d he said again, his gaze searching my face.</p><p>I touched him while I still could, my hands sliding over his sweat-slick chest, feeling the desperate beat of his heart. \u201cMore than anything.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>\u201cGOOD MORNING, ACE.\u201d</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at the sound of Eva\u2019s voice, smiling as I watched her circle the island on her way to the coffeemaker. Her hair was a wild tangle, her legs sexy beneath the hem of the T-shirt she wore.</p><p>Returning my attention to the stove and the French toast I was browning in the pan, I asked, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm . . .\u201d</p><p>I looked at her again and found her blushing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sore,\u201d she said, inserting a coffee pod into the machine. \u201cDeep inside.\u201d</p><p>I grinned. The swing had positioned her perfectly, allowing for optimal penetration. I\u2019d never been as deep in her before. I had been thinking about it all morning and decided that I would be speaking to Ash about his plans for the renovations. One of the bedrooms would need to have two closets\u2014one for clothes, the other for the swing.</p><p>\u201cJeez,\u201d she muttered, \u201cLook at that cocky smirk. Men are pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I am, slaving over a hot stove for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She swatted my ass as she passed me with a steaming cup of coffee in hand.</p><p>I caught her by the waist before she got too far, giving her a quick hard kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou were amazing last night.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d felt something click into place between us so strongly that the change had been as tangible as the rings I wore on my fingers, and I cherished it as dearly.</p><p>She flashed me a dazzling smile, then opened the fridge to pull out the carton of half-and-half. While she took care of that, I plated the finished French toast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to talk to you about something,\u201d she said, joining me at the island and wriggling onto a bar stool.</p><p>My brows lifted. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to become involved with the Crossroads Foundation\u2014financially and administratively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could encompass a lot of things, angel. Tell me what you have in mind.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she picked up her fork. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the settlement money I got from Nathan\u2019s dad. It\u2019s just sitting in the bank, and after what Megumi has been through . . . I\u2019ve realized that I need to put that money to work and I don\u2019t want to wait. I\u2019d like to help fund the programs offered by Crossroads and help brainstorm ways to expand them.\u201d</p><p>I smiled inwardly, pleased to see her moving in the right direction. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She brightened like the sun, the shining light in my world.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019d like to commit more time to it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work together!\u201d She bounced up and down. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>I let the smile show. \u201cI can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just feels like a natural progression for us. An extension of us, really.\u201d She cut into her food and forked a bite to her mouth. She hummed her appreciation. \u201cYummy,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hot and you can cook. I\u2019m a lucky girl.\u201d</p><p>I decided not to tell her I\u2019d just downloaded the recipe that morning. Instead, I considered what she\u2019d said.</p><p>Had I made a tactical error by moving too quickly with Mark? It was possible that if I\u2019d left it alone just a little longer, Eva might have come around to working at Cross Industries on her own.</p><p>But did I have the luxury of giving her more time with Landon closing in? Even now, I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Seeking to mitigate any possible fallout, I debated the merits of broaching the topic of Mark\u2019s move to Cross Industries now versus later. Eva had opened the door by talking about us working together. If I didn\u2019t walk through it, I ran the risk of her finding out another way.</p><p>I had taken that chance on Saturday, knowing Eva and Mark were friends who talked outside work. He could\u2019ve called her at any time, but I\u2019d banked on him thinking it over first, discussing it with his partner, and coming to peace with leaving Waters Field &amp; Leaman.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to you about something, too, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>Shooting for nonchalance, I grabbed the maple syrup and poured some onto my plate. \u201cI offered Mark Garrity a job.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of stunned silence, and then, \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>The tone of her voice confirmed that I\u2019d been right to be up front sooner rather than later. I looked at her. She was staring at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve asked Mark to work for Cross Industries,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>Her face paled. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d she parroted. \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday. You\u2019re just bringing this up now?\u201d</p><p>Since the question was rhetorical, I didn\u2019t reply, choosing to wait for a clearer assessment of the situation before possibly making things worse.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Gideon?\u201d</p><p>I took the same tack I\u2019d used with Mark\u2014I told the parts of the truth most likely to be accepted. \u201cHe\u2019s a solid employee. He\u2019ll bring a lot to the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d The color came back into her face in an angry rush. \u201cDon\u2019t patronize me. You\u2019re putting me out of a job and you didn\u2019t think that was something you should discuss with me first?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I switched tactics. \u201cLanCorp asked for Mark directly, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She was silent a minute. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about? The PhazeOne system? Are you fucking serious?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d wondered what product Ryan Landon would use as an excuse to approach Eva. I was surprised he\u2019d gone with a product so vital to his bottom line, then chastised myself for not expecting it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does it matter?\u201d she snapped. \u201cYeah, they asked for Mark. So what? You don\u2019t want your competitors using him? Are you trying to say this was a business decision?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, this was personal.\u201d I set my utensils down. \u201cEric Landon, Ryan Landon\u2019s father, invested heavily with my dad and lost everything. Ryan Landon has been gunning for me ever since.\u201d</p><p>A frown marred the space between her brows. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t want us working on any campaigns for him? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that Ryan Landon asked for Mark as a way to get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Irritation mixed with anger on her face. \u201cHe\u2019s married, for chrissakes. He brought his wife to lunch with us the other day. You\u2019ve got no reason to be jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be interested in you that way,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a triumph to have you working for him. He wants the satisfaction of knowing he can give an order and you\u2019ll have to jump to get it done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the whole of it, Eva. How many years he\u2019s spent trying to undercut me in every way possible. Every business decision he makes is driven by the need to rewrite the connection between the Landon and Cross names. Every success he\u2019s had has been accompanied by a mention of his father\u2019s failure to see my dad as a fraud and what that cost the Landons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t see fit to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it doesn\u2019t matter anymore!\u201d She slid off the bar stool and stalked out of the kitchen.</p><p>I went after her, as I always did. \u201cEva.\u201d</p> <p>I caught her by the elbow, but she yanked free, spinning to face me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t walk away from me,\u201d I growled. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to fight, let\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you were counting on, right? You figured you\u2019d do whatever you wanted, then sweet-talk or fuck your way through it later. But you can\u2019t fix this, Gideon. You can\u2019t say a few words or screw me brainless and get away with it this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFix what? I saw someone maneuvering to take advantage of you and I took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you see it?\u201d Her hands went to her hips. \u201cI don\u2019t see it that way at all. Landon is taking the risk. What if Mark and I do a crappy job? He\u2019s got a lot riding on PhazeOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. He has in-house advertising, marketing, and promotion, just like I do. Why take something he\u2019s sunk a fortune into\u2014even by my standards\u2014and set himself up for leaks or a massive fail?\u201d</p><p>She threw her hands up with a snort.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I bit out. \u201cYou can\u2019t answer that because there is no good answer. It\u2019s an unnecessary gamble. The only people handling the launch of the next-generation GenTen are people whose souls I own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Landon\u2019s waited a long time for his pound of Cross flesh. Maybe he doesn\u2019t care that you married into the name. I don\u2019t know what he has in mind. At the very least, he\u2019s forcing us into a place where we\u2019re unable to share information with each other.\u201d</p><p>Her brow arched. \u201cHow is that any different from how our relationship usually works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I clenched my hands at my sides, frustrated by her stubbornness. \u201cDon\u2019t make this about us when it\u2019s about him. I\u2019ll be damned if Landon drags you through hell because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong! If you\u2019d told me about this, I would\u2019ve made the right decision on my own. Instead, you forced me out of a job I love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack up. What decision would that have been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She gave me a cold, hard smile that chilled my blood. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ll never find out.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to me again.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m getting dressed. Then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d I followed her into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be around you right now, Gideon. I don\u2019t even want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>My mind raced, searching for something to say that would calm her down. \u201cMark hasn\u2019t taken the job.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and yanked open a drawer to pull out a pair of shorts. \u201cHe will. I\u2019m sure you made him an offer he can\u2019t refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll withdraw it.\u201d God. I was backpedaling and it rankled, but she was so angry I couldn\u2019t reach her. She was as distant as I\u2019d ever seen her. Remote and untouchable. After the wildly erotic night we\u2019d had, when we had been as close as ever, her attitude was unbearable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother, Gideon. The damage is done. But you\u2019ll get a solid employee who\u2019ll bring a lot to your team.\u201d She tugged the shorts on and went into the closet.</p><p>I was right behind her, blocking the doorway while she shoved her feet into flip-flops. \u201cListen to me, damn it. They\u2019re coming after you. Everyone. They want to get at me through you. I\u2019m doing the best I can, Eva. I\u2019m trying to protect us the only way I know how.\u201d</p><p>She paused, facing me. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem. Because this way doesn\u2019t work for me. It will never work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, I\u2019m trying! \u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you had to do was talk to me, Gideon. I was halfway there on my own. Working with you on Crossroads was just the first step. I was going to make the decision to work with you, and you took that away from me. You took it away from both of us. And we\u2019ll never get it back.\u201d</p><p>The icy finality in her tone made me crazed. I could deal when discussions went sideways. I could spin and switch strategy on the fly. What I couldn\u2019t handle was when my grip on Eva slipped. When we\u2019d said our vows, I had made the irrevocable decision to let everything go\u2014my ambition, my pride, my heart\u2014to hang on to her. If I couldn\u2019t do that, I had nothing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw that at me now, angel,\u201d I warned. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve brought up working together you shut me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you just bulldoze right through me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was willing to give you time! I had a plan. I was going to seduce you with the possibilities, let you decide that the best way to develop your potential was alongside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve stuck with the plan. Get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>I held my ground. \u201cHow could I stick with any plan the last few weeks? While you\u2019re feeling righteous, think about what I\u2019ve dealt with. Brett, the damned tape of you with him, Chris, my brother, therapy, Ireland, my mother, Anne, Corinne, fucking Landon\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eva crossed her arms. \u201cGotta handle it all yourself, don\u2019t you? Am I really your wife, Gideon? I\u2019m not even your friend. I bet Angus and Ra\u00fal know more about your life than I do. Arash, too. I\u2019m just the pretty cunt you fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out of my way before this gets any uglier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you leave. You know I can\u2019t. Not like this.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to give you something I don\u2019t have right now. I\u2019m hollowed out, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel . . .\u201d I reached for her, my chest so tight I found it hard to breathe. The devastation on her face was killing me. I\u2019d destroy anyone who put that look on her face, but this time, I had done it. \u201cWhat does it matter if you would\u2019ve made the same decision anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to stop talking,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cBecause every word coming out of your mouth makes me think we\u2019re so far apart on this that we\u2019ve got no business being married.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d stabbed me in the chest, it couldn\u2019t have hurt worse. The air in the closet became hot and stale, drying my throat and making my eyes burn. The floor seemed to tilt beneath my feet, the foundation of my life shifting as Eva slipped further and further away.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Her eyes glistened. \u201cLet me go for now. Give me some space to think. A few days\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d Panic swelled until I was forced to grip the door frame to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a few weeks. I need to find a new job, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I gasped, panting for air. A black ring encroached on my vision, until Eva was the lone pinpoint of light. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, something else, Eva!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to figure out what to do now.\u201d She rubbed at her forehead with rough fingers. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t think when you\u2019re looking at me like that. I can\u2019t think . . .\u201d</p><p>She moved to pass me and I grabbed her by the arms, kissing her, groaning when I felt her soften for an instant. I tasted her, tasted her tears. Or maybe they were mine.</p><p>Her hands went to my hair, fisting it, pulling it hard. She turned her head, breaking the seal of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cCrossfire,\u201d she sobbed, the word cracking like a gunshot.</p><p>I released her abruptly, stumbling back, even as my mind screamed at me to hang on.</p><p>I let her go, and she left me.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE sea breeze blows through my hair and I close my eyes, absorbing the feel as it buffets me. The rhythmic push and pull of the waves against the beach and the raucous cries of seagulls anchor me in the moment, in this place.</p><p>It\u2019s home in a way I haven\u2019t known for a long time, although I\u2019ve spent less than a handful of days here. It is a place I\u2019ve shared only with Eva, so all of my memories of here are as drenched with her as the sand is with rays of the sun. Like the sand, I\u2019ve been crushed down into fine, tiny bits by the forces around me. And like the sun, Eva has brought joy and warmth to my existence.</p><p>She joins me on the deck, standing behind me at the railing. I feel her hand on my shoulder, then the press of her cheek against my bare back.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d I murmur, and place my hand over hers.</p><p>This is what we needed, to come back to this place. It\u2019s our retreat when the world closes in on us, trying to separate us. We heal each other here.</p><p>Relief washes through me. She\u2019s back. We\u2019re together. She understands now why I did what I did. She was so angry, so hurt. For a moment, I had felt crippling fear that I\u2019d destroyed the most precious part of my life.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d she breathes, in that husky siren\u2019s voice. One arm slides around my waist to hold me from behind.</p><p>I tilt my head back and let the power of her love pour through me. Her fingers glide over my hip, and then she\u2019s holding my cock in her hand. Stroking it from root to tip. I harden and thicken, ready for her. I live to serve her, to please her. How could she have doubted it?</p><p>A moan rumbles up from the very depths of my soul, the desire I always feel for her climbing through me. Pre-cum leaks from the swollen head of my dick, my balls growing heavy and full.</p><p>Her hand on my shoulder glides down my back, pressing lightly, urging me to bend forward.</p><p>I obey because I want her to see how she owns me. I want her to understand that I would do anything, give anything, to make her safe and happy.</p><p>Her hand traces my spine, kneading lightly. I grip the wooden handrail that circles the deck and spread my legs at her urging.</p><p>Now, both of her hands are between my thighs, her breath hot and panting against my back. She\u2019s pumping my cock with a firm, practiced grip. Harder than I\u2019m used to from her. Demanding. Her other hand is massaging my sac, driving the urgency into me.</p><p>Her grip slickens as the pre-cum streams steadily from the slit at the tip of my dick. The salty air washes over me, cooling the sweat misting my skin.</p><p>\u201cEva . . .\u201d I gasp her name, so hard for her, so desperately in love.</p><p>Her fingers, now creamy and always cleverly agile, slide back and tease the dark rosette of my anus. It feels good, even though I don\u2019t want it to. The stroking of my penis is making it hard to breathe, to think, to fight . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she coaxes.</p><p>I try to arch away, but she\u2019s got me trapped with my dick in her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I tell her, squirming.</p><p>\u201cYou like it,\u201d she purrs, working my cock, her touch something I crave and can\u2019t resist. \u201cShow me how much you want me.\u201d</p><p>She pushes two slick fingers inside my ass. I cry out, writhing away, but she\u2019s rubbing and thrusting into me, hitting the spot that makes me want to come more than anything. The pleasure grows despite the tears burning my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head falls forward. My chin touches my heaving chest. It\u2019s coming. I\u2019m coming. I can\u2019t stop it. Not with her . . .</p><p>The fingers inside me thicken, lengthen. The thrusting becomes frenzied, the slap of flesh against flesh drowning out the sounds of the ocean. I hear a rough, lusty growl but it\u2019s not mine. A cock is in me, fucking me. It hurts and yet the pain is tinged with a sick, unwanted pleasure.</p><p>\u201cKeep stroking it,\u201d he pants. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>Agony explodes in my chest. Eva isn\u2019t here. She\u2019s gone. She\u2019s left me.</p> <p>Vomit rises into my throat. I throw him off violently, hearing him crash through the sliding door behind us, the glass shattering. Hugh laughs hysterically and I round on him, finding him sprawled amid the glistening slivers, his hair as red as his blood, his eyes lit with that vile lustful avarice.</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019d want you?\u201d he taunts, clambering to his feet. \u201cYou told her everything. Who\u2019d want you after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d I lunge and tackle him back down. My fist pounds into his face again and again.</p><p>The shards of glass pierce me, cut into me, but the pain is nothing next to what I feel inside.</p><p>Eva is gone. I\u2019d known she would leave, that I couldn\u2019t keep her. I\u2019d known it, but I had hoped. I couldn\u2019t fight the hope.</p> <p>Hugh won\u2019t stop laughing. I feel his nose shatter. His cheekbone, his jaw. His laughter turns to gurgles, but it\u2019s still laughter.</p><p>My arm pulls back to hit him again\u2014</p><p>Anne is lying beneath me, her face battered nearly beyond recognition. Horrified at what I\u2019ve done, I jerk away, scrambling to my feet. The glass digs deep into the soles of my feet.</p><p>Anne laughs as bubbling blood pours from her nose and mouth, spreading through the home that was once a sanctuary. Staining everything, the taint washing away the sun until only a blood moon remains . . .</p><p>I woke up with a scream in my throat. Sweat drenched my hair and skin. Darkness suffocated me.</p><p>Scrubbing at my eyes, I rolled onto my hands and knees, sobbing. I crawled toward the only light I could see, the weak silver glow that was my only guide.</p> <p>The bedroom. God. I collapsed on the floor, racked by tears. I\u2019d fallen asleep in the closet, unable to move after Eva left me, afraid to take one literal step in any direction toward a life without her in it.</p><p>The face of the clock glowed brightly in the darkened room.</p><p>It was one A.M.</p><p>A new day. And Eva was still gone.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE here early.\u201d</p><p>Scott\u2019s cheery voice lured my gaze from the photo of Eva on my desk.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I greeted him, feeling as if I were still in a nightmare.</p> <p>I\u2019d come to work shortly after three A.M., unable to sleep anymore and unable to go to Eva. I wanted to, would have\u2014nothing could keep me away from her\u2014but when I tracked her phone I found her at Stanton\u2019s penthouse, a place I couldn\u2019t reach. The anguish of that, knowing she was deliberately keeping herself from me, ate at me from the inside out like acid.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stay home and go through the morning routine of preparing for work without Eva. It had been easier to revert to the schedule I\u2019d often kept before her, coming into work while the moon was high, finding peace in the place where I exercised complete control.</p><p>But today there was no peace. Only the torment of knowing that she was in the same building I was by now, so damn close and yet farther away than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cMark Garrity was waiting by reception when I came in,\u201d Scott continued. \u201cHe said you\u2019d discussed having him come in today . . . ?\u201d</p><p>My gut knotted. \u201cI\u2019ll see him.\u201d</p><p>I pushed back from my desk and stood. I\u2019d thought of nothing but Eva and the offer I had made to Mark, trying to reason out how I could have done anything differently. I knew Eva too well. Telling her about Ryan Landon wouldn\u2019t have made her leave Waters Field &amp; Leaman any more than telling her about Anne would cause her to be more cautious.</p><p>Eva would face them head-on instead, growling like a lioness to defend me and failing to see the danger to herself. It was her way and I loved her for it, but I would also protect her when the situation called for it.</p><p>\u201cMark.\u201d I extended my hand as he entered, knowing immediately that he was going to say yes. Energy radiated off him and his dark eyes were lit with anticipation.</p><p>We agreed that he would begin in October, giving Waters Field &amp; Leaman nearly a month\u2019s notice. He wanted to bring Eva along with him and I encouraged him to make the offer, even as I doubted that she would accept it. He countered some of my terms and I negotiated by instinct, keeping him in check without my heart being in it.</p><p>In the end, he left happy and pleased with his changed situation. I was left with the deepening fear that Eva would not forgive me.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>MONDAY blurred into Tuesday. There were only three times a day when I felt any life at all\u2014at nine when I knew Eva arrived for work, at lunch, and again at five when she finished for the day. I waited with endless hope for her to reach out to me. To call or communicate in any way. Another horrible fight would be better than the aching silence.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. I could only watch her on the security monitors, devouring the sight of her coming and going like a man dying of hunger, scared to approach her and risk widening the chasm between us.</p><p>I stayed in the office overnight, afraid to go home. Afraid of what I would do if I entered any of the residences I shared with her. Even my office was a torment, the couch where I had fucked her an inescapable reminder of what I\u2019d had only days before. I showered in my office\u2019s washroom and changed into one of the many suits I kept at work.</p><p>I\u2019d never thought it strange to live for work before. Now, I was overwhelmed by emotion I couldn\u2019t express, comprehending just how much of my life Eva had come to fill.</p><p>She stayed at Stanton\u2019s again. It didn\u2019t escape my notice that she preferred to spend time with her mother than to risk having to deal with me.</p><p>I texted her constantly. Pleas for her to call me. I just need to hear your voice. Notes about nothing. Cooler today, isn\u2019t it? Comments about work. Never realized Scott always wears blue. And most of all, I love you. For some reason, it was easier to type those three words than to say them. I typed them a lot. Over and over again. I didn\u2019t want her to forget that. Whatever my faults and fuck-ups, everything I did or thought or felt was love for her.</p><p>Sometimes I got mad, hating what she was doing to me. To us. Goddamn you! Call me. Stop doing this to me!</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Arash said, eyeing me as I reviewed the contracts he\u2019d placed on my desk. \u201cYou getting sick again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy man, you are anything but fine.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him, shutting him up.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>IT was nearly six and I was on my way to Dr. Petersen\u2019s office when Eva finally reached out to me.</p><p>I love you, too.</p><p>The words wavered as my eyes stung. I typed back with shaking fingers, nearly dizzy with relief. I miss you so much. Can\u2019t we talk, please? I need to see you.</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply before I reached Dr. Petersen\u2019s, which blackened my mood to the point of violence. She was punishing me in the worst possible way. I was as jittery as a junkie, desperate for a hit of her to function. To think.</p><p>\u201cGideon.\u201d Dr. Petersen greeted me at the door to his office with a smile that quickly faded when he saw me. Concern drew his brows down. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>He calmly gestured for me to take a seat. I remained standing, roiling inside, debating leaving and searching for my wife. I couldn\u2019t stand around and wait anymore. It was too much to ask of me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should walk again,\u201d he said. \u201cI could stand to stretch my legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Eva,\u201d I ordered. \u201cTell her to come here. She\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at me. \u201cYou\u2019re having trouble with Eva.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging out of my suit jacket, I threw it on the couch. \u201cShe\u2019s being irrational! She won\u2019t see me . . . won\u2019t talk to me. How the fuck are we supposed to work things out if we\u2019re not even talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right! I\u2019m a reasonable man. She, however, is out of her damn mind. She can\u2019t keep doing this. You have to get her here. You have to make her talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. But first I need to understand what\u2019s happened.\u201d He sat in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be much use to you if I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>I pointed a finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t play your head games with me, Doc. Not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m being as reasonable as you are,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI want you to work things out with Eva, too. I think you know that.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling in a rush, I sank onto the edge of the sofa, then dropped my head into my hands. It was throbbing viciously, pounding front and back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fighting with Eva,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you spoke with her?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard. \u201cSunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>I told him. It came out in a rush that had him scribbling frantically on his tablet. The words spewed out in an angry purge, leaving me feeling wiped out and exhausted.</p><p>He continued to write for a few moments after I finished, and then his gaze lifted to my face. I saw compassion and it tightened my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou cost Eva her job,\u201d he pointed out, \u201ca job she\u2019s told us both that she enjoys very much. You can see why she\u2019d be upset with you, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it. But I had valid reasons. Reasons she understands. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t get. She understands and she\u2019s still cutting me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand why you didn\u2019t discuss this with Eva beforehand. Can you explain that to me?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at the back of my neck, where the tension felt like steel cables. \u201cShe would\u2019ve stewed over it,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIt would\u2019ve taken her time to come around. In the meantime, I\u2019m trying to manage a ton of other shit. We\u2019re getting hit from all sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the news about Corinne Giroux\u2019s book about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d My mouth curved grimly. \u201cShe probably got the idea from Six-Ninth\u2019s \u2018Golden\u2019 video. Landon got to Eva through a hole in my guard. I couldn\u2019t risk giving him another opening while I was distracted with everything else Eva and I are dealing with right now.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Petersen nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re facing a lot of pressure. Don\u2019t you trust Eva to help you reach the decisions you\u2019re making? You have to know that her conflicts with her mother often stem from not being consulted before actions are taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I tried to articulate my chaotic thoughts. \u201cBut I need to take care of her. After what she\u2019s lived through . . .\u201d</p><p>My eyes squeezed shut. Knowing what she\u2019d suffered was almost too much for me to think about sometimes. \u201cI have to be strong for her. Make the tough calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon, you\u2019re one of the strongest men I know,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me the way she has.\u201d</p><p>Crying like a child. Brutalized by memories. Masturbating while unconscious. Violent in my sleep. Weak, so weak. Helpless.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she doubts you because you\u2019ve let her see you vulnerable? That doesn\u2019t sound like Eva to me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung. \u201cYou don\u2019t know everything. You just . . . You don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Eva does. And she married you anyway. She loves you\u2014very much\u2014anyway.\u201d He offered a kind smile that somehow slashed like a blade, cutting me open. \u201cYou asked me once if relationships were about compromise. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>I jerked a nod.</p><p>\u201cThat compromise means you don\u2019t always have to be the strong one, Gideon. You can do the heavy lifting on occasion, and you can let Eva do it sometimes. Marriage isn\u2019t about whether you\u2019re strong enough as an individual. It\u2019s about how strong you are together and the luxury of taking turns carrying the load.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d My head bowed again. Eva had said the same thing. \u201cI\u2019m trying. I swear to God, I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to take me back. She has to come back. I need her. She\u2019s killing me right now. She\u2019s ripping me apart.\u201d I stared at my hands, at the rings she\u2019d given me that made me hers. \u201cWhat do I do? Tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva is going to want to know that you\u2019re willing to change. She\u2019ll want to see you taking steps to demonstrate that. You won\u2019t face these big decisions too often, so she may adopt a wait-and-see attitude. That will be hard for you, I think. Very hard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded slowly, but I couldn\u2019t wait anymore. If Eva needed proof that I\u2019d do anything to keep her, I would give it to her.</p><p>My hands clenched into fists. My gaze stayed on the carpet between my feet. \u201cI was\u2014\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cThe therapist. The one I had when I was a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe . . . he molested me. For nearly a year. He . . . raped me.\u201d</p> <p>20</p><p>I miss you so much. Can\u2019t we talk, please? I need to see you.</p><p>\u201cStill staring at that text?\u201d Cary asked, rolling onto his back on the bed beside me and pressing his temple to mine.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d It was torture to stay away from Gideon. I spent every minute\u2014waking and sleeping\u2014feeling like someone had hacked out my heart and left a gaping hole in my chest.</p><p>I looked up at the canopy above my mom\u2019s guest bed. Like her sitting room, the bedroom she\u2019d put me in was newly redecorated. With its palette of cream and moss green, the room was soothing and tastefully elegant. The guest bedroom Cary occupied was done in a more masculine style with grays and navy, with walnut furnishings on the opposite end of the spectrum from the white gilded pieces in my room.</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you going to talk to him, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. I just . . .\u201d I lowered the phone to my chest and pressed it against my heart. \u201cI think we both need a little time.\u201d</p><p>It was so hard to think when Gideon and I were fighting. I hated it.</p><p>And it was worse because he was the one who\u2019d fucked up, and like everything he did, he had done so spectacularly. I couldn\u2019t imagine how I could forgive him and live with myself. On the other hand, I couldn\u2019t imagine how I could go forward without him and live, period. I felt dead inside. The only thing keeping me going was the belief that somehow we\u2019d work things out and be together. How could we not? How could I give so much of myself to someone and then let that person go?</p><p>I thought about the advice I\u2019d given to Trey and how we were both facing the same decision\u2014did we choose love or did we choose ourselves? I was so pissed off at Gideon for being the one who forced my hand. I\u2019d recognized that certain situations were pushing me into that spot, but I had never thought my husband would.</p><p>And why the hell did the two choices have to be mutually exclusive? It wasn\u2019t fair.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re running him through the wringer,\u201d Cary pointed out, unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done it, not me.\u201d Gideon had taken something precious from me, but worse, he had taken something precious away from us\u2014my free will and the trust I\u2019d given him to respect it. After that last night we\u2019d had . . . as much as I had trusted him and opened myself to him . . . And he\u2019d already talked to Mark. The feeling of betrayal was heartrending. \u201cThanks for sticking with me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI like Stanton. It\u2019s no hardship hanging at his place a few days. We are eventually going home, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve always said,\u201d he muttered. \u201cPersonally, I like hiding. Just taking a fucking break and forgetting about all the crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the crap\u2019s always out there waiting for you.\u201d And knowing that, I always preferred to face it head-on. Get it out of the way and behind me.</p><p>\u201cLet it wait,\u201d he said, reaching up to ruffle my hair.</p><p>Turning my head, I pressed a kiss to his cheek. I\u2019d cried gallons on him the last three days and curled up against him at night. At times, it felt like his arms were the only things holding me together.</p> <p>God. I hurt all over. I was a fucking mess, a zombie in the vibrantly lively city of New York.</p><p>Where was Gideon now? Was the pain of our separation starting to ease? Or was he still as devastated by it as I was?</p><p>\u201cMark asked me to move to Cross Industries with him,\u201d I said, just to force my mind onto something else.</p><p>\u201cWell, you saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, but it was still surreal when he brought it up.\u201d I sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s so excited, Cary. He\u2019s getting a hefty raise, and that will change a lot of things for him and Steven. They\u2019ll be able to afford a really fancy wedding plus a long honeymoon, and they\u2019re looking for a condominium now. It\u2019s hard to hold on to my resentment when this is such a good thing for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to work for Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t kidding when I told him I was halfway toward making that decision on my own. But now . . . I kinda want to apply elsewhere just to spite him.\u201d</p><p>Cary lifted his fists and shadowboxed. \u201cShow him he\u2019s not the boss of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I threw a few punches, too, just to give myself a little lift. \u201cBut that\u2019s stupid. I\u2019d never know if I got hired for me or for his name, whether that turned out to be a good or a bad thing. Anyway, I\u2019ve got a month before Mark moves on. I\u2019ve got time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Waters Field and Leaman will keep you. Have you considered that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility. I\u2019m not sure how I would respond. It would save me a job search, but I wouldn\u2019t have Mark, and he\u2019s the reason I love my job. Would I still want to be there without him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d still have Megumi and Will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s that,\u201d I agreed.</p><p>We lay there in companionable silence for a while.</p><p>Then he said, \u201cSo it looks like you and me are just floating around in the hell-if-I-know boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrey is going to call,\u201d I assured him, even though I still had no idea what Trey would say when he did.</p><p>\u201cSure. He\u2019s a nice guy. He won\u2019t leave me hanging.\u201d Cary sounded so weary. \u201cIt\u2019s what he\u2019s going to say, not when, that\u2019s the kicker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Love should be easier than this,\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cIf this were a romantic comedy, it\u2019d be called Love Actually Sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should\u2019ve stuck with Sex and the City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTried that. Ended up Knocked Up. I should\u2019ve gone for being a 40-Year-Old Virgin, but I had way too much of a head start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can write a manual on How to Lose a Guy in 10 Weeks.\u201d</p><p>Cary looked at me. \u201cFucking perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>WEDNESDAY morning hit me like a hangover.</p><p>Getting ready for work at my mom\u2019s place helped me to not miss Gideon so much, but it sure as hell didn\u2019t separate me from my mother, who was driving me nuts talking about the wedding nonstop. Even Stanton, with his endless capacity for indulging my mom\u2019s neurosis, gave me sympathetic looks when he was around.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think about the wedding now. I couldn\u2019t think beyond each and every hour of the day. That was how I was getting by\u2014one hour at a time.</p><p>When I stepped out of the lobby onto the street, I found Angus waiting for me with the Bentley rather than Ra\u00fal with the Benz. I managed a smile, genuinely pleased to see him, but I was wary, too.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Angus.\u201d I jerked my chin toward the car and whispered, \u201cIs he in there?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, then touched the brim of his vintage chauffeur\u2019s hat. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Cross.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his shoulder briefly before sliding past the door he opened and into the backseat. In short order we were easing into the snarl of morning traffic and heading toward midtown.</p><p>Leaning forward, I asked, \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse than you, I expect.\u201d He glanced at me briefly before returning his attention to traffic. \u201cHe\u2019s suffering, lass. Last night was the hardest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d I sank back into the seat, at a loss for what to do.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Gideon to hurt. He\u2019d been hurt too much already.</p><p>Pulling out my smartphone, I texted him. I love you.</p><p>His reply was almost immediate. Calling. Pls answer.</p><p>A moment later the phone vibrated in my hand and his picture appeared on my screen. It was like a quick stab to the heart to see his face after spending the last few days avoiding any image of him. I was equally afraid to hear his voice. I didn\u2019t know if I could be strong. And I didn\u2019t have the answers he needed from me.</p><p>My voice mail kicked in and the phone quieted. It started vibrating again right away.</p><p>I answered, lifting the phone to my ear without speaking.</p><p>There was silence on the line for a long, breathless moment. \u201cEva?\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered at the sound of Gideon\u2019s voice, the rasp in it so deep, as if his throat were rough. What was worse was the hope I heard in the way he said my name, the desperate longing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t talk,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI just . . .\u201d He gave a shaky exhale. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eva. I want you to know I\u2019m sorry and that I\u2019ll do whatever you need me to. I just want to fix this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon . . .\u201d I heard him suck in a sharp inhalation when I said his name. \u201cI believe that you\u2019re sorry we\u2019re not together now. But I also believe that you would do something like this again. I\u2019m trying to figure out if I can live with that.\u201d</p><p>Silence hung on the line between us.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cWhat would be the alternative?\u201d</p><p>I sighed, suddenly feeling so tired. \u201cI don\u2019t have any answers. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve stayed away. I want to give you everything, Gideon. I never want to say no to you, it\u2019s so hard for me. But right now, I\u2019m afraid that if I make this compromise, if I stay with you knowing how you are and that you\u2019re not going to change, I\u2019m just going to resent you and, eventually, fall out of love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva . . . Christ. Don\u2019t say that!\u201d His breath snagged. \u201cI told Dr. Petersen. About Hugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My head snapped up. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night. I told him everything. About Hugh. Anne. He\u2019s going to help me, Eva. He said some things . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cThey made sense to me. About me and the way I am with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d I could imagine how difficult that must have been for him. I\u2019d lived through that confession myself. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you. I know it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to stick with me. You promised. I told you I was going to fuck this up. I\u2019ll fuck up again. I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing, but God . . . I love you. I love you so fucking much. I can\u2019t do this without you. I can\u2019t live without you. You\u2019re breaking me, Eva. I can\u2019t . . .\u201d He made a low, pained noise. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh God, Gideon.\u201d Tears poured down my face and splattered onto my chest, sliding down beneath the neckline of my dress. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we figure it out together? Aren\u2019t we better\u2014stronger\u2014together?\u201d</p><p>I wiped at my face, knowing my makeup was ruined and not caring. \u201cI want us to be. I want that more than anything. I just don\u2019t know if we can get there. There hasn\u2019t been a single time when you\u2019ve let me figure things out with you. Not once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did . . . if I do\u2014and I will\u2014you\u2019ll come back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t left you, Gideon. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d I looked out the window, spotted a young couple kissing each other good-bye in front of a revolving door before the man ran off. \u201cBut yes, if we could really be a team, nothing could keep me away.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cHEARD you guys landed the PhazeOne campaign.\u201d</p><p>I turned my attention from the coffee I was sweetening to raise my brows at Will. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, his eyes sparkling behind his glasses. He was such a happy guy, anchored solidly in a relationship that worked. I was so envious of that serenity. I had felt it only a few times since I\u2019d been with Gideon, and every time it was . . . bliss. How amazing would it be if we could get there and stay there?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the buzz I\u2019ve been hearing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMan.\u201d I gave an exaggerated sigh. \u201cI am always the last to know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been putting on an Oscar-worthy performance all week. Between Mark\u2019s excitement, the imminent adjustment in my work situation, starting my period, and dealing with the mess in my private life, I was focusing every ounce of energy I had left on acting calm. As a result, I\u2019d avoided the office gossip cliques to limit my contact with people. There was only so much happiness/joy/contentment I could fake.</p><p>\u201cMark\u2019s going to kill me for telling you.\u201d Will looked completely unapologetic. \u201cI wanted to be the first to congratulate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thank you. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to get my hands on that system, you know. The tech blogs are wild with rumors about PhazeOne\u2019s features.\u201d He leaned against the counter next to me and gave me a hopeful look.</p><p>I wagged my finger at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t be hearing any leaks from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn it. A guy\u2019s gotta hope.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to lock you in solitary somewhere until the release just to keep a lid on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes you wonder why LanCorp would take it to an outside agency, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYeah. I guess. Hadn\u2019t thought about it.\u201d</p><p>Neither had I. But Gideon had.</p> <p>I looked back down at my mug, stirring absently. \u201cThere\u2019s a new GenTen coming out soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. That\u2019s a no-brainer, though. Everyone\u2019s going to buy it.\u201d</p><p>Flexing my fingers, I studied my wedding ring and thought about the vows I\u2019d made when I accepted it.</p><p>\u201cYou got plans for lunch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I picked up my mug and faced him. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going out with Mark and his partner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d He moved toward the coffeemaker when I got out of the way. \u201cMaybe we could grab drinks after work sometime this week. Drag our significant others with us. If Gideon\u2019s up for it. I know he\u2019s a busy guy.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth. Closed it again. Will had given me the perfect opening to excuse Gideon. I could take it, but I wanted to share the social parts of my life with my husband. I wanted him with me. If I started excluding him from my life, wasn\u2019t that the beginning of the end?</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d I lied, imagining a tension-fraught evening. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him about it. See what we can work out.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cCool. Lemme know.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019VE got a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d I looked across the table at Mark. The Cuban restaurant Steven had chosen was both large and popular. Sunlight streamed in through a massive skylight, while colorful murals decorated the space with parrots and palm fronds. Festive music made me feel like I\u2019d gone on vacation to somewhere exotic, while the rich smell of spices made my tummy perk up for the first time in days.</p><p>I rubbed my hands together. \u201cLet\u2019s fix it.\u201d</p><p>Steven nodded. \u201cEva\u2019s right. Lay it on us.\u201d</p><p>Mark pushed the menu aside and set his elbows on the table. \u201cSo Mr. Waters told me this morning to start working on the LanCorp brief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d I applauded.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast. In light of that, I had to give him my notice. I\u2019d been hoping to wait until Friday, but they need someone who can stick with the client all the way through, not just the first month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a point,\u201d I conceded, my smile fading. \u201cWhat a bummer, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucked, but . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt is what it is. Then he called in the other partners. They told me that the LanCorp brass was insistent that I head the campaign when they first approached the agency, enough so that the partners are worried they\u2019ll lose the account if I\u2019m not managing it.\u201d</p> <p>Steven grinned and slapped him on the shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s what we like to hear!\u201d</p><p>Mark gave a sheepish smile. \u201cYeah, it was a boost, for sure. So anyway, they offered me a promotion and a raise if I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s a serious boost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t offer what Cross did. Not even half, but let\u2019s be honest, he\u2019s overpaying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you,\u201d Steven scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re worth every penny.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though I had only a vague idea of what Gideon had put on the table. \u201cI agree with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I feel like I owe Waters Field and Leaman some loyalty.\u201d Mark rubbed at his jaw. \u201cThey\u2019ve been good to me and they want to keep me, even knowing I can be poached by someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given them good work for years,\u201d Steven countered. \u201cThey got a lot out of you. You don\u2019t owe them any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. And I was fine with leaving an empty office behind, because they could fill that quick enough. But I\u2019m having a hard time with possibly costing them the LanCorp campaign when I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that decision isn\u2019t yours to make,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cIf LanCorp doesn\u2019t retain the agency, that\u2019s up to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried spinning it that way, too. But it\u2019s still not something I want to see happen.\u201d</p><p>The server came by to take our order. I looked at Steven. \u201cCan you do the honors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He looked at Mark, who gave a quick nod to signal the same request. Steven ordered for all of us.</p><p>I waited until we were alone again to speak, unsure of how to say what needed to be said. In the end, I went with blunt. \u201cI can\u2019t work on the PhazeOne campaign.\u201d</p><p>Mark and Steven stared at me.</p><p>\u201cLook, the Landons and the Crosses go way back,\u201d I explained, \u201cand there\u2019s bad blood between them. Gideon\u2019s got some concerns, and I see his point. It\u2019s strong enough for me to be cautious.\u201d</p><p>Mark frowned. \u201cLandon knows who you are. He doesn\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the PhazeOne system is a pretty big deal. There\u2019s risk involved with having access to it, and I don\u2019t need to contribute to that in any way.\u201d It was hard admitting that Gideon was right, because I knew I was right, too. Which left us at an impasse I didn\u2019t know how to get around.</p><p>Steven leaned closer and studied me. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. Not that your decision is in any way affected by me, Mark, but I thought I should put that out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I understand,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s telling you that if you stay with your job, you\u2019ll be losing both the money and your assistant,\u201d Steven clarified. \u201cOr you can move to Cross Industries as you\u2019ve already agreed to do, get the money, and keep Eva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d God. This was harder than I\u2019d thought it would be. I had heard it but now I was living it: Any woman who loses or gives up a job she loves because of a man will resent it . . . What had ever made me think I would be somehow exempt? \u201cI can\u2019t say yet that I\u2019ll be making the move with you.\u201d</p><p>Mark fell back against the burgundy vinyl booth. \u201cThis just keeps getting worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying definitively that I won\u2019t.\u201d I tried to shrug it off as no big deal. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure that Gideon and I should be working together. I mean I\u2019m not sure he should be my boss . . . or whatever. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say it,\u201d Steven said, \u201cbut she\u2019s got a point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not helping my problem,\u201d Mark muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell them how sorry I really was. I didn\u2019t even feel like I could offer advice. How could I be nonbiased about Mark\u2019s options?</p><p>\u201cOn the bright side,\u201d I offered instead, \u201cyou\u2019re definitely a hot commodity.\u201d</p><p>Steven elbowed Mark with a grin. \u201cI knew that already.\u201d</p><p>\u2014</p><p>\u201cSO\u201d\u2014Cary slung his arm around me when I curled into his side\u2014\u201chere we are again.\u201d</p><p>Another night at my mom\u2019s. She\u2019d finally gotten suspicious, considering it was our fourth night in a row at her place. I confessed to arguing with Gideon, but not why. I didn\u2019t think she would understand. I\u2019m sure she would think it was perfectly normal for a man in Gideon\u2019s position to handle all the pesky little details. And as for me possibly losing my job? Why would I want to work when I had no financial reason to?</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. Some daughters wanted to grow up to be just like their mothers; I wanted the opposite. And my need to be the anti-Monica was the main reason I struggled so much with what Gideon had done. Any advice from her would only make things worse. I almost resented her as much as I did him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go home tomorrow,\u201d I said.</p><p>After all, I\u2019d be seeing Gideon at Dr. Petersen\u2019s office at the very least. I was desperately curious about how that would go. I couldn\u2019t help but hope that Gideon had turned a major corner with therapy. If so, maybe there were other corners we could turn. Together.</p><p>I crossed my fingers.</p><p>And really, I had to give Gideon credit for doing his best to give me the space I\u2019d asked for. He could\u2019ve caught me in an elevator or the lobby of the Crossfire. He could have told Ra\u00fal to drive me to him instead of wherever I directed. Gideon was trying.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Trey?\u201d I asked.</p><p>It was kind of miraculous how often Cary and I ended up in the same place at the same time. Or maybe it was a shared curse.</p><p>\u201cHe sent me a text saying he was thinking about me but wasn\u2019t ready to talk yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>His hand ran up and down my back. \u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m in the same place with Gideon. I think about him all the time, but I don\u2019t have anything to say to him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next? Where do you go from here? When do you decide you\u2019ve got something more to say?\u201d</p><p>I thought about that a minute, absently watching Harrison Ford hunt for answers in The Fugitive, which we had on mute. \u201cWhen something changes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he changes, you mean. What if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t have that answer yet, and when I tried to think about it, I went a little crazy.</p><p>So I asked Cary a question instead. \u201cI know you want to put the baby first and that\u2019s the right thing to do. But Tatiana\u2019s not happy. And you\u2019re not, either. Trey\u2019s definitely not. This isn\u2019t working out for any of you. Have you thought about being with Trey and the two of you helping Tatiana with the baby?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cShe\u2019s not gonna go for that. If she\u2019s miserable, everyone else has to be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that should be her choice to make. She\u2019s as responsible for getting pregnant as you are. You don\u2019t have to do some sort of penance, Cary.\u201d I put my hand over the arm he had lying in his lap, my thumb brushing carefully over the fresh scars on his inner forearm. \u201cBe happy with Trey. Make him happy. And if Tatiana can\u2019t be happy with having two hot guys looking after her, then she\u2019s . . . not doing something right.\u201d</p><p>Cary laughed softly and pressed his lips to the crown of my head. \u201cSolve your own problem that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could.\u201d I wished for that more than anything. But I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>And I feared it might be impossible.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>THE vibration of my smartphone woke me.</p><p>When I realized what the buzzing was, I began searching blindly for my phone, my hands sliding around the bed until I found it. By then, I\u2019d missed the call.</p><p>Squinting at the glaringly bright screen, I saw it was just past three A.M. and Gideon had called. My heart skipped as worry chased away sleep. Once again I\u2019d gone to bed cradling my phone, unable to stop reading the many texts he had sent me.</p><p>I called him back.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he answered on the first ring, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d He blew out his breath. \u201cI had a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I blinked up at the canopy that I couldn\u2019t see in the dark. My mother was a fan of blackout drapes, saying they were necessary in a city that was never truly dark. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>It was a lame reply, but what else could I say? It would be pointless to ask if he wanted to talk about it. He never did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having them a lot lately,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cEvery time I fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>My heart hurt a little more. It seemed impossible that it could take so much pain, but there was always more. I\u2019d learned that long ago.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stressed, Gideon. I\u2019m not sleeping well, either.\u201d And then, because it had to be said, \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEva . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I scrubbed at my eyes. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was a mixed signal that would only make things worse for him. I felt guilty for staying away, even though I knew I had good reason to.</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to hear it. I\u2019m scared, Eva. I\u2019ve never felt fear like this. I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t come back . . . that you won\u2019t give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dreamed about my father at first. We were walking on the beach and he was holding my hand. I\u2019ve been dreaming about the beach a lot lately.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, my chest aching. \u201cMaybe that means something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I was little in the dream. I had to look up a long way to see my dad\u2019s face. He was smiling, but then I always remember him smiling. Even though I heard him fighting with my mom a lot toward the end, I can\u2019t remember any other expression on his face but a smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you made him happy. And proud. He probably always smiled when he looked at you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was quiet for a minute, and I thought maybe that was it. Then he went on. \u201cI saw you up ahead on the beach, walking away from us.\u201d</p><p>I rolled onto my side, listening intently.</p><p>\u201cYour hair was blowing in the breeze and the sun lit it up. I thought it was beautiful. I pointed you out to my dad. I wanted you to turn your head so we could see your face. I knew you were gorgeous. I wanted him to see you.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled in my eyes and slid down to wet my pillow.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to run after you. I was pulling at his hand and he was holding me back, laughing about chasing pretty girls at my age.\u201d</p><p>I could picture the scene so clearly in my mind. I could almost feel the brisk breeze whipping through my hair and hear the seagulls calling. I could see the young Gideon in the picture he\u2019d given me and the handsome, charismatic Geoffrey Cross.</p><p>I wanted a future like that. With Gideon walking down the beach with our son who looked just like him, my husband laughing because our troubles were behind us and a bright, happy future lay ahead of us.</p><p>But he\u2019d called it a nightmare, so I knew that future I envisioned wasn\u2019t one he saw.</p><p>\u201cI was tugging so hard on his hand,\u201d he continued, \u201cdigging my bare feet into the sand for traction. But he was so much stronger than me. You were walking farther and farther away. He laughed again. Only this time, it wasn\u2019t his laugh. It was Hugh\u2019s. And when I looked up again, it wasn\u2019t my father anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Gideon.\u201d I sobbed his name, unable to hold back the sympathy and grief. And the relief that he was talking to me at last.</p><p>\u201cHe told me you didn\u2019t want me, that you were going away because you knew everything and it made you sick. That you couldn\u2019t get away fast enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d I sat up in bed. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true. I love you. It\u2019s because I love you so much that I\u2019m thinking so hard about this. Us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to give you space. But I feel like it would be so easy for us to drift apart. A day goes by, then another. You\u2019ll find a new routine without me in it . . . Christ, Eva, I don\u2019t want you to get over me.\u201d</p><p>I spoke in a rush, my thoughts tumbling out of my mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to get through this, Gideon, I know there is. But when I\u2019m with you I lose myself in you. I just want to be with you and to be happy, so I let things ride and put them off. We make love and I think we\u2019ll be okay, because we have that and it\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is perfect. It\u2019s everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re inside me, looking at me, I feel like we can conquer anything. But we\u2019ve really got to work on this! We can\u2019t be afraid to deal with our baggage because we don\u2019t want to lose each other.\u201d</p><p>He growled softly. \u201cI just want us to spend time together not dealing with all this other shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I rubbed at the pain in my chest. \u201cBut we have to earn it, I think. We can\u2019t manufacture it by running away for a weekend or a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we earn it?\u201d</p><p>I swiped at the tears drying on my cheeks. \u201cTonight was good. You calling me, telling me about your dream. It\u2019s a good step, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep making steps, then. We have to keep moving together or we\u2019re going to end up moving apart. Don\u2019t let that happen! I\u2019m fighting here, with everything I\u2019ve got. Fight for me, too.\u201d</p><p>My eyes stung with fresh tears. I sat for a while, crying, knowing he could hear me and that it was hurting him.</p><p>Finally, I swallowed the pain down and made a snap decision. \u201cI\u2019m going to that all-night caf\u00e9 on Broadway and Eighty-fifth for coffee and a croissant.\u201d</p> <p>He was silent for a long minute. \u201cWhat? Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d I tossed back the covers on the bed and slid to the floor.</p><p>Then he got it. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Killing the call, I dropped the phone on the bed and fumbled for the light. I ran to my duffel bag, digging out the butter yellow maxi dress I\u2019d shoved in there because it was easy to pack and comfortable to wear.</p><p>Now that I was decided on seeing Gideon, I was anxious to get to him, but I had my vanity, too. I took the time to brush out my hair and put a little makeup on. I didn\u2019t want him to see me after four days and wonder why he was so gone over me.</p><p>My phone buzzed a notification of a text and I hurried over to it, seeing a note from Ra\u00fal: I\u2019m out front with the car.</p><p>A little zing went through me. Gideon was anxious to see me, too. Still, he never missed a trick.</p><p>I shoved my phone into my purse, my feet into sandals, and hurried out to the elevator.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>GIDEON was waiting on the street when Ra\u00fal pulled up to the curb. Many of the storefronts on Broadway were shuttered and dark, although the street itself remained well lit. My husband stood within the light cast by the caf\u00e9\u2019s awning, his hands shoved into the pockets of his dark jeans and a Yankees ball cap tugged low over his brow.</p><p>He could\u2019ve been any young man out late at night. Clearly attractive by the way his hard body filled his clothes and the confidence in the way he carried himself. I would\u2019ve given him a second and third look. He wasn\u2019t as intimidating outside the three-piece suits he wore so well, but he was still dark and dangerous enough to hold me back from the lighthearted flirting most devastatingly handsome men inspired.</p><p>In jeans or Fioravanti, Gideon Cross was not a man to be taken lightly.</p><p>He was at the car almost before Ra\u00fal pulled to a complete stop, yanking the door open and then freezing in place, staring at me with such scorching hunger and possessiveness that I found it hard to breathe.</p><p>I swallowed past the lump in my throat, my equally ravenous gaze sliding all over him. He was unbelievably more beautiful, the expertly sculpted planes of his face honed further by his torment. How had I lived the past few days without seeing that face?</p><p>He held his hand out to me and I reached for it, my own trembling in anticipation of his touch. The brush of his skin against mine sent tingles of awareness racing through me, my bruised heart surging with life at being in contact with him again.</p><p>He helped me out, then pushed the door closed, rapping twice on the roof to send Ra\u00fal away. As the Benz left us, we stood barely a foot apart, the air crackling with tension between us. A taxi raced by, honking its horn as another car turned onto Broadway without looking. The harsh sound jolted Gideon and me both.</p><p>He took a step toward me, his eyes dark and hot beneath the brim of his hat. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>Then he cupped my jaw and tilted his head, fitting his mouth over mine. His lips, so soft and firm and dry, pressed mine open. His tongue slid deep and rubbed, withdrew, slid deep again. He groaned as if he were in the greatest pain. Or pleasure. For me, it was both. The hot stroke of his tongue into my mouth was like a sweet, slow fucking. Smoothly rhythmic, skilled, with just the perfect tease of leashed passion.</p><p>I moaned as euphoria sparkled through me like champagne, the ground shifting beneath my feet so that I clung to him for balance, my hands wrapping around his wrists.</p><p>I whimpered in protest when he pulled away, my lips feeling achy and swollen, my sex wet with desire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make me come,\u201d he murmured, unable to resist brushing his lips over mine one last time. \u201cI\u2019m right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved and chased the shadows away. \u201cThe next time I come will be inside you.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a shaky breath at the thought. I wanted that, and yet I knew it would be too soon now. That we\u2019d fall too easily back into the unhealthy pattern we had established. \u201cGideon . . .\u201d</p><p>His smile turned rueful. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll settle for coffee and a croissant for now.\u201d</p><p>I loved him so much in that moment. Impulsively, I pulled off his hat and gave him a great big smacking kiss on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he breathed, his gaze so tender it made me feel like crying again. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so damn much.\u201d</p><p>I slid the hat back on his head and grabbed his hand, leading him around the little metal fences cordoning off an outside seating area from the pedestrian traffic. We entered the caf\u00e9 and settled at a table by the window, Gideon on one side and me on the other. But we didn\u2019t stop holding hands, our fingers stroking and rubbing, each of us touching the other\u2019s wedding bands.</p><p>We ordered when the server walked over with the menus, then turned our attention back to each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even hungry,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cNot for food, anyway,\u201d he rejoined.</p><p>I shot him a mock glare that made him smile. Then I told him about the retention offer Waters Field &amp; Leaman had made Mark.</p><p>It seemed wrong to talk about something so practical, so mundane, when my heart was giddy with love and relief, but we had to keep talking. Reconnecting wasn\u2019t enough; I wanted a full and total reconciliation. I wanted to move into the renovated penthouse with him, start our life together. To do that, we had to keep communicating about the things we\u2019d spent our relationship avoiding.</p><p>Gideon nodded grimly when I finished. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. An account like that should be handled by one of the partners. Mark\u2019s good, but he\u2019s a junior manager. LanCorp would\u2019ve had to push to get him. And you. The request is unusual enough to give the partners cause for concern.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Kingsman Vodka. \u201cYou did the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d I looked at our joined hands. \u201cBut I told him I couldn\u2019t work on the PhazeOne campaign even if he stayed to manage it.\u201d</p><p>Gideon\u2019s grip tightened on mine.</p><p>\u201cYou have good reasons for doing the things you do,\u201d I said quietly, \u201ceven if I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>He took a slow, deep breath. \u201cWill you come with him to Cross Industries if he moves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. I\u2019m feeling pretty resentful right now. Unless that changes, it wouldn\u2019t be a healthy working relationship for either of us.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>The server came back with our order. Gideon and I released each other by necessity to give her room to put the plates on our settings. When she walked away, a heavy silence descended between us. There was so much to say, but so much that had to be figured out first.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cTonight\u2014after Dr. Petersen\u2014could I take you out to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I accepted eagerly, grateful to move past the awkwardness into action. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>I could see similar relief soften the hard line of his shoulders and wanted to do my share to build it. \u201cWill asked if we\u2019d be up for grabbing a drink with him and Natalie this week.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile touched Gideon\u2019s mouth. \u201cI think that\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>Small steps. We would start with those and see where they took us.</p><p>I pushed back from the table and stood. Gideon pushed to his feet quickly, eyeing me warily. I rounded the table and took the seat next to him, waiting until he sat again so that I could lean into him.</p><p>His arm came around me and he settled me into the crook of his neck. A soft sound escaped him when I snuggled in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m still in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d His cheek rested against the top of my head. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out the rest. We\u2019ll get back on track.\u201d</p><p>We sat together and watched the city rouse from sleep. The sky lightened. The pace of life quickened.</p><p>It was a new day, bringing with it a new chance to try again. </p> </body></html>"]
