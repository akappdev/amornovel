In fact, the more the merrier! Me\u2019n Jessica here\u2014\u201d he whacked Jessie\u2019s bikini-clad butt hard, \u201c\u2014are up for a good fuckin\u2019 time tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a good time fucking,\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cYou got that right,\u201d Mike shot back to additional wolf whistles.</p><p>Jessica. The little fucking prick didn\u2019t even know Jessie\u2019s name, for Christsake. What the hell was she doing with him?</p><p>Ain\u2019t that why you\u2019re spying on her like some lovesick peeping Tom? To figure out why she turned you down but she\u2019s hooked up with a loser worse than you?</p> <p>Brandt ignored his sarcastic internal voice that resembled his father\u2019s. He remained as still as a hunter tracking prey as he spied on his brother\u2019s widow. The woman he\u2019d purposely stayed away from for the last six months. Sweet Jesus, sweet Jessie looked good. Better than good and it didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with the skimpy string bikini she wore. He\u2019d always suspected a knockout body lurked beneath the frumpy western clothes she\u2019d favored, but holy shit. She was perfect\u2014all long, lean muscles with a few well-placed curves.</p><p>\u201cAny takers?\u201d Mike prompted the motley group of drunks.</p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mike\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mike ground his mouth into Jessie\u2019s, cutting off her protest.</p><p>Encouraging whoops rang out when Mike wrapped his arms around Jessie\u2019s bare thighs. He clumsily threw her over his shoulder, half-stumbling past the fire pit as he headed toward the campsites.</p> <p>Since Jessie was hanging upside down, Brandt couldn\u2019t tell how she felt about Mike\u2019s invitation for a sexual free for all.</p><p>He scowled and picked his way around rocks and shrubs, trying to keep the couple within his line of sight. But his damn flip-flops slipped on the pine needles. Tree branches scraped his bare chest and legs since he only wore board shorts. His fishin\u2019 buddies, Rob and Brent, had already packed up their tackle Cowgirls Don\u2019t Cry</p><p>boxes. He should\u2019ve gone home an hour ago, after his less-than-productive chat with Jessie...except he didn\u2019t trust these douchebags, and his gut instinct had been dead on. He doubted Jessie had turned into a party girl, indulging in random fucks with strange guys.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s changed. Maybe she wants to experience every sexual scenario Luke had indulged in.</p><p>Highly unlikely. But he wanted to keep her from doing something she\u2019d regret.</p><p>Mike stopped in front of a mid-sized camper. He let Jessie slide down his body and pushed her against the side of the camper as he opened the door.</p><p>Was she that drunk Mike had to hold her up?</p><p>Nope. Jessie walked into the camper on her own accord.</p> <p>Fuck.</p><p>A couple minutes later, two guys, talking loudly about blowjobs and double penetration, wandered up from the bonfire.</p><p>Brandt was out of the darkness, blocking them before either reached the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d A sunburned, shirtless blond guy waved a bottle of vodka in Brandt\u2019s face. \u201cYou here to fuck that skinny chick too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna fuck her. I\u2019m gonna ram my dick so far into her mouth she\u2019ll feel my balls on her chin,\u201d boasted the second guy, who sported an ape-like chest.</p><p>Brandt crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough players, so take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that, man,\u201d the blond spat. \u201cWe were invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the hairy one chimed in, \u201cmove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d No way was he letting these guys past him. No. Fucking. Way.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re tough,\u201d hairy guy sneered. \u201cThere\u2019s two of us and only one of you. I\u2019d say the odds are in our favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then bring it, motherfucker, \u2019cause I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere.\u201d</p><p>The blond dude squinted at Brandt. \u201cHold up a sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? We can take him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that cowboy asshole from the bar fight at Rockin\u2019 R last month.\u201d The blond guy spoke to his friend. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who punched Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the guy whose ribs I broke?\u201d Brandt asked, hoping the lie sounded credible.</p><p>\u201cNo. You busted Troy\u2019s tooth. Fucked up his face good too.\u201d</p><p>Brandt shrugged. \u201cHuh. I guess it must\u2019ve been the other guy who wanted a piece of me\u2014right after I handed your buddy his ass. Or should I say after I handed him his tooth.\u201d</p><p>The two guys exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember a helluva lot from that night except I was pissed off, shitfaced and spoilin\u2019 for a fight.\u201d He flashed his teeth in a feral grin. \u201cUnlike now. I\u2019m pissed off, spoilin\u2019 for a fight, but I\u2019m completely sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we doin\u2019 this? Or are you two walkin\u2019 the fuck away?\u201d</p><p>Both guys held up their hands and backed off. \u201cNo problem, man. We\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And feel free to pass along the message that Mike\u2019s invitation for an orgy has been canceled.\u201d</p><p>They nodded and stumbled back toward the party.</p><p>Brandt waited another couple of minutes, but no one else appeared.</p><p>His deep inhalation didn\u2019t provide a sense of calm. Chances were high his temper would still get the best of him tonight, but it couldn\u2019t possibly be worse than his imagination. He opened the door.</p><p>The older model camper smelled musty and was dark except for a light shining from the back. He passed a cramped living area and froze by the miniscule cook top when he noticed two naked forms. One standing. One...not.</p><p>Jessie was on her knees. Her strawberry blonde waves hung down her spine, brushing the dimples above her bare ass when she bobbed her head. Mike\u2019s hands were twisted in her hair as he bumped his pelvis into Jessie\u2019s face. His chorus of \u201cThat\u2019s it, baby\u201d and \u201cSuck it harder\u201d bounced off the fake paneling.</p><p>Brandt had been ready\u2014eager even\u2014to jump in and pummel that little fucking prick Mike if he\u2019d taken advantage of Jessie. But it appeared Jessie...was enjoying giving Mike a blowjob. Brandt must\u2019ve made a noise, because Mike looked up with a drunken leer.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to wonder if anyone was gonna take me up on my offer. Go ahead and get nekkid.</p><p>I\u2019m about finished.\u201d Mike\u2019s hold on Jessie\u2019s head tightened as he rammed his cock into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there. That\u2019s good, baby. Get ready to swallow.\u201d</p><p>Jessie vehemently shook her head no.</p><p>Mike\u2019s braying donkey laughter grated. \u201cNo swallowing on the first date, huh? I\u2019ll come on your tits.</p><p>But you hafta do the work.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back, dislodging his cock from her mouth with a soft pop. Her arm moved up and started moving fast as she jacked him off.</p><p>Mike shut his eyes, not watching as Jessie finished him.</p><p>Brandt should\u2019ve been turned off. He should\u2019ve walked off.</p><p>So why was he having the exact opposite reaction? Why had his dick leapt to attention as if it were next in line?</p><p>\u201cThat was fantastic.\u201d Mike pulled up his trunks as Jessie got to her feet.</p><p>\u201cCan I get a drink?\u201d Jessie asked, wiping off her chest with a beach towel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something right here.\u201d Mike handed her a nearly empty bottle of Southern Comfort.</p><p>Jessie grabbed it, chugging until Mike snatched it out of her hand, warning, \u201cHey, leave some for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me drunk so we could get our freak on.\u201d</p><p>Another donkey like laugh erupted. \u201cYou need to be drunk to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>He swatted her ass. \u201cHop up on the bed. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Jessie face-planted in the center of the mattress.</p><p>Before Brandt moved, Mike blocked him and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t do nothin\u2019 to her until I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I left a joint in my truck. I\u2019d offer to share, but there\u2019s really only like half left, so...\u201d</p><p>Man, Jessie really knew how to pick \u2019em. This fucker had no problem sharing her with another guy or two, but he had an issue sharing his pot?</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>Mike pointed at Brandt\u2019s swimming trunks. \u201cMight as well strip them off so we can get right to it when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Brandt shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll be leavin\u2019 them on.\u201d</p><p>A slimy smile distorted Mike\u2019s face. \u201cYou sly motherfucker. You like to watch, eh?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d like to watch my fist connect with your face. But Brandt merely shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d The camper door slammed behind Mike.</p><p>Brandt paused by Jessie\u2019s side, unsure what to do. He swept her silky hair from her face, which caused her to emit a disgruntled sound and turn her head away from him.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Brandt sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cJessie?\u201d</p><p>Her body went rigid, but she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>He tried again. \u201cJessie? It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d</p><p>Holy hell that hurt. Like a hoof to the solar plexus that knocked the breath from his lungs kind of pain.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away, Luke, you\u2019re not real.\u201d</p><p>Was she slurring her words? \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta, but I won\u2019t let you make me feel guilty after all the times you were drunk. After all you did to me, you bastard.\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked, creating another chink in Brandt\u2019s armor.</p><p>A beat of silence passed. And another. Finally Brandt spoke. \u201cJessie. Listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m done listening to my dead husband\u2019s phantom voice. So go away, get outta my head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGoddammit, Jessie, look at me.\u201d</p><p>Miracle of miracles, she rolled over, angrily pushed her tangled hair from her face and squinted at him.</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t let his gaze fall below her chin.</p> <p>Jessie had that glassy-eyed look from too much alcohol, and her reaction time was slower, but she didn\u2019t react like he\u2019d expected. No embarrassment. No trying to cover her naked body. Hell, she didn\u2019t even shriek with surprise. She just stared at him.</p><p>He stared back.</p><p>\u201cI forgot how much you and Luke sound alike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t tryin\u2019 to pretend to be him,\u201d Brandt said softly.</p><p>That comment brought her sad smile. \u201cI know. There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d</p> <p>There was that kicked-in-the-heart sensation again.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stick around? I wasn\u2019t very nice to you.\u201d</p><p>His thoughts skipped back to Jessie\u2019s bored appraisal of him and her insulting parting shot. \u201cI intended to take off. B-but...\u201d Goddammit. Why was he such a stammering freakin\u2019 idiot around her?</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t because you were worried about me.\u201d She held his gaze. \u201cWhy? Luke would have left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Luke.\u201d Like he needed to remind her of that fact, after she\u2019d already done such a bang up job of reminding him.</p><p>\u201cI know that too, Brandt.\u201d</p> <p>Do you? Do you really?</p><p>She frowned, almost as if she\u2019d heard his internal thoughts.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Get dressed and I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>Jessie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m staying here with Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell would you do that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause he treats me like I\u2019m sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Jessie. He almost treated you to a gang bang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh-uh. I know you and that\u2019s not you talkin\u2019.\u201d Brandt pointed to the bottle of Southern Comfort.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the booze talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The camper door slammed.</p><p>She tossed her head. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know me as well as you think you do, McKay.\u201d</p><p>The emphasis on McKay, as if it were some sort of disease, had Brandt seeing red.</p><p>The instant Mike swayed into the doorway, Jessie scooted to the end of the bed, cooing, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Didja miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Let\u2019s get this party started.\u201d</p><p>Enough. Brandt pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>Mike shot Brandt a stoned look. \u201cI thought you were gonna watch us fuck? You know. Like live porn.\u201d</p><p>When phrased that way? Jesus. It made him sound like a loser who couldn\u2019t score his own woman. He looked at Jessie\u2014just as she started to slide off the bed.</p><p>Brandt dove for her, snaking his arm around her waist, bringing her naked back against his chest as he anchored himself.</p><p>\u201cDude.\u201d Mike blinked at him. \u201cTalk about Superman reflexes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Brandt. A superhero in the flesh. A boy scout. A real trooper. The ultimate gentleman cowboy, always willing to lend a hand.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d known each other for four years and that\u2019s how Jessie saw him? A damn do-gooder? While some guys might like those comparisons, he didn\u2019t. Not at all. Especially not from Jessie. Especially not tonight when he was skating so close to the edge of disproving that gentleman cowboy remark to her in explicit detail.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t done taunting him. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy who always does the right thing. Which is why he\u2019ll skip out, even if he wants to stay.\u201d</p><p>And with that smartass comment...Jessie had pushed him too far.</p><p>\u201cYou know, on second thought, I do believe I will stick around and lend a hand.\u201d</p><p>Jessie gasped when Brandt brought them down on the edge of the mattress. He hooked her legs over the tops of his thighs, then moved her body forward so her ass hung off the bed. After circling her wrists with his fingers, he rested on his elbows and placed her palms flat on the mattress and nestled his groin against her back.</p><p>\u201cYou hold her and I\u2019ll go first. Then it\u2019ll be your turn,\u201d Mike promised.</p><p>She squirmed, sliding her smooth shoulders against Brandt\u2019s bare chest. The friction of his swimming trunks rubbing against his cock as her body writhed on his instantly turned his cock into granite.</p><p>Brandt allowed his gaze to drop to the Mike\u2019s groin after he ditched his cutoffs.</p><p>What the hell? Mike\u2019s dick hung between his scrawny thighs like a limp worm. Seeing Jessie\u2019s naked body spread out for him like a feast didn\u2019t affect him at all? Jesus. How would that make Jessie feel?</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s so drunk she won\u2019t notice.</p><p>For the first time, Brandt hoped that was true.</p><p>Will you step in and show her how she affects you if this douche fucker can\u2019t get it up?</p><p>No. But that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t distract her. Brandt angled his head and spoke quietly. \u201cJessie, is this really what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I d-don\u2019t... Yes,\u201d she reiterated firmly, \u201cit\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he said harshly. Then he softened toward her, in mind and body, nuzzling the tender, fragrant skin behind her ear. \u201cJust close your eyes. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>A heartbeat or two later, Jessie relaxed into him, turning her head so her rapid breaths drifted across his chest.</p><p>In that moment he wanted her with an ache that defied reason. It went beyond sex. It went beyond anything he\u2019d ever felt before.</p><p>Brandt tore his attention away from Jessie and looked up at Mike\u2014who frowned at the state of his non-responsive dick. Mike knocked back a slug of Southern Comfort and set the bottle aside. His fingers traced the inside of Jessie\u2019s thighs as he leaned over to suck her right nipple into his mouth.</p><p>Jessie arched and she tried to move her hands to touch Mike, but Brandt held her firmly. She wiggled, moaning as Mike kissed down her belly and staggered to his knees. Brandt knew the instant Mike\u2019s mouth connected with Jessie\u2019s sex. Her back bowed as if she\u2019d been touched by a defibrillator.</p><p>Goddammit. This was so fucking bizarre, but also almost...erotic, holding her, feeling her body\u2019s response as another man pleasured her.</p><p>She whimpered, \u201cYes. Please. More.\u201d</p><p>Mike kept a slurred dialogue, extolling the virtues of Jessie\u2019s pussy in outdated porn terms, which he probably believed turned her on. But the idiot didn\u2019t notice Jessie reacted most strongly when he quit flapping his gums and put his mouth on her.</p><p>Finally, Mike got to it, spiking Brandt\u2019s jealousy to epic proportions to hear Mike\u2019s slurping, sucking noises from between Jessie\u2019s quivering thighs. He wanted to be the one eking out her feminine sighs and moans. He wanted to be the one tasting her. He wanted to be the one driving her to the brink of ecstasy.</p><p>Sweat broke out on his brow. On the back of his neck. Moisture coated his balls. And it didn\u2019t help that Jessie\u2019s sexy, slippery body was sliding all over his. Specifically against his impatient cock.</p><p>A loud thud sounded and Jessie\u2019s thrashing stopped abruptly. Brandt released her wrists to see what the hell the noise was.</p><p>Jessie maneuvered her body away from Brandt\u2019s. They peered over the edge of the bed.</p><p>Holy shit. Mike had passed out cold on the floor.</p><p>In the middle of going down on Jessie.</p><p>Unfuckingbelievable.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cYou think he had a heart attack or something?\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t frantically checking him over, which meant she wasn\u2019t so out of it she couldn\u2019t see the truth. She nudged his leg. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>Mike let out a soft snore.</p><p>Once again Brandt\u2019s heart broke when Jessie made a soft sob. She scampered away from him quickly, like a crab sinking back into the sand. \u201cJessie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m takin\u2019 you home. Where are your clothes?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Focusing on his anger on her behalf kept him from pitying her. \u201cFine.\u201d Brandt tossed the comforter over her, rolled her like a sausage, and lifted her into his arms.</p><p>She gasped, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakin\u2019 you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m naked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t like that swimsuit covered up much anyway.\u201d And yeah, when Brandt stepped over Mike\u2019s sprawled form, he might\u2019ve kicked the guy\u2019s ribs. The idiot wouldn\u2019t have noticed if he\u2019d been kicked in his numb nuts.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, Brandt. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d</p><p>The walk from the camper to his truck was mighty long and mighty quiet. He deposited her in the passenger side of his pickup before he climbed in. After he started backing out, she said, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You feel like you\u2019re gonna barf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I forgot my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s still in the cab of Mike\u2019s pickup.\u201d</p><p>Brandt whipped a U-turn and followed the bumpy trail from the public parking area back to the campsites. He pulled up behind Mike\u2019s camper and shut off his truck, pocketing the keys. He issued a stern,</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go nowhere, Jessie, I mean it,\u201d and bailed out.</p><p>The pungent scent of pot smoke wafted out of Mike\u2019s truck as Brandt opened the door. A roach clip dangled from the rearview mirror, weighted with feathers and skinny strips of leather. He pushed aside food wrappers and empty beer cans until he found a small bright orange fanny pack. Since he\u2019d forgotten to ask specifics about size and color, he unzipped the main compartment. His hand froze.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the unopened package of condoms that snared his interest, but the hand-tooled leather wallet.</p><p>The wallet he\u2019d made Jessie for Christmas\u2014in what turned out to be the only Christmas they\u2019d spent together.</p><p>The ragged edge of Brandt\u2019s thumb traced the row of flowers he\u2019d so painstakingly pounded out in the supple leather above the metal clasp. After he\u2019d tanned the row a rich brown and finished the rough edges with a leather whipstitch, he\u2019d painted each tiny flower a different color. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t believe Jessie had kept the wallet. She\u2019d seemed embarrassed when she\u2019d opened his present. Too late Brandt learned such a labor-intensive gift was appropriate for a girlfriend. Or a lover. Or a wife. None of which Jessie was to him. Luke had been a real prick about it, too, teasing him mercilessly.</p><p>Ragging on Jessie. They\u2019d both ignored Luke, and Brandt figured Jessie had probably thrown it out to keep the peace with her husband. Warmth expanded in his chest even as he called himself ten kinds of fool for feeling that spark of pleasure.</p><p>He scrutinized the inside of the truck cab for anything else that might belong to her before he zipped up the purse and jogged back to his pickup.</p> <p>Jessie had wedged herself in the corner. Relief swept over her when he tossed the purse in her lap.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna check to see if anything is missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just take me home.\u201d</p><p>He let her be, even when he wanted to assure her that Mike\u2019s reaction was a result of booze and pot, not a reaction to her. They\u2019d barely driven two miles when he heard Jessie sniffle. Brandt glanced over at her. \u201cJess. Baby. Please. Don\u2019t cry. I swear to God you\u2019re killin\u2019 me here.\u201d</p> <p>Her voice was a raw rasp. \u201cChin up, buck up, right? Be strong, be tough. Don\u2019t snivel. No man likes a crybaby. Yeah. I know. I\u2019ve heard that a time or fifty.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d meant and her response jabbed that raw wound in his gut again. Before he could explain, Jessie said, \u201cDo you wanna know something? Tonight was supposed to be \u2018the night\u2019 when I\u2019d finally...\u201d She sniffled again. \u201cGod. How pathetic is it that I had to build up my courage to do it and this is how it turned out? How fucking pathetic that I\u2019m twenty-seven years old and I haven\u2019t been with any man besides Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d spewed out of his mouth before he could stop it. Brandt knew Jessie hadn\u2019t dated at all during the year they grieved together over Luke. But he hadn\u2019t expected she\u2019d stayed celibate during the months he hadn\u2019t seen her, especially since he\u2019d heard she\u2019d been out, hitting the local honky-tonks.</p><p>It burned his ass to think her experience with that little fucking prick Mike was her first foray into reclaiming a sexual part of herself.</p><p>Her soft sigh tempered his anger. \u201cYes, Luke was my first, my only, but we were married for two years. So I\u2019m not...inexperienced as much as I\u2019m out of practice.\u201d</p><p>Brandt wanted to tell her to shut up as much as he wanted her to keep talking.</p> <p>\u201cI miss sex. A lot.\u201d</p><p>She intended to torture him all right.</p><p>\u201cDoes it make me sound like a horny widow if I admit I want that body-to-body connection? I can get myself off with my vibrator a dozen times a day if I want. But it\u2019s not the same, is it?\u201d</p><p>I can demonstrate the difference, if you want.</p><p>She was quiet for a minute or so, and Brandt thought she\u2019d fallen asleep. But her voice broke into his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you had sex?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019d been a few weeks, which didn\u2019t compare to the two years she\u2019d gone without.</p><p>\u201cSo out there in the dating world, does oral sex count as real sex? Because I\u2019m thinking if I didn\u2019t get off, even if he did, then it shouldn\u2019t count as sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI cannot believe we\u2019re havin\u2019 this conversation.\u201d He sensed her studying him, but he kept his eyes on the road.</p><p>\u201cWell, it is a pretty one-sided conversation, Brandt.\u201d She paused again. \u201cThink Mike will tell everyone we did the nasty?\u201d</p><p>Brandt snarled, \u201cIf he opens his goddamn mouth and says anything to anyone about you, I will track that little fucking prick down and cut his tongue out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s sweet. Okay, maybe not sweet, and wow, I never imagined you had such a violent streak, Brandt. It\u2019s kinda scary.\u201d</p><p>You have no idea.</p><p>Jessie made a noise that sounded like a choked laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen again, maybe you\u2019d be doing a service to womankind, cutting out his tongue. Because, man, he really did not know how to use it.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, Mary and Joseph give him strength to survive this discussion with Jessie about oral sex, vibrators, tongues, abstinence and...nope. The devil had taken over his thoughts and was conjuring up some smokin\u2019 hot scenarios, adding in rope for fun.</p><p>When she thrashed to get more comfortable, Brandt looked over to double check she hadn\u2019t wiggled too close to the door handle. He hit the automatic locks as a precaution.</p><p>Always looking out for her, aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Somebody has to.</p><p>The rest of the drive might\u2019ve been awkward if she\u2019s kept peppering him with questions about sex and freely offering her own insight. But she either drifted off or pretended to, and Brandt was grateful for the reprieve. Didn\u2019t keep his brain from offering advice in case she suddenly became chatty again.</p><p>At the turnoff to her trailer, Jessie stirred. After he parked by her front porch steps, she faced him. Not with a sheepish look, as he expected, but with a resigned look. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry you had to...\u201d She gestured wildly. \u201cBe party to my humiliation tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cIt was. And you don\u2019t have to be nice about it. So thank you. Please...now that I\u2019ve had time to think about what an idiot I was, I never want to talk about it again, okay?\u201d</p><p>Brandt bit back, No, it\u2019s not okay, goddammit, what the hell were you thinking tonight?</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t want any kind of reminder of tonight.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d ever forget this night.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of it. Burn it, use it as a rag, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He refocused on her. \u201cGet rid of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She unwrapped the comforter from around her body and shoved it between them.</p><p>Then Jessie was as naked as a newborn babe, in the front seat of his truck.</p><p>Oh no. No, no, no.</p><p>Brandt was so pole-axed he couldn\u2019t make his mouth work when Jessie bounced out of his truck and strolled to her house, wearing nothing but her birthday suit.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been so busy gawking at her perfectly pear-shaped ass, or if he hadn\u2019t become mesmerized by the sassy way her hair teased the dimples above that perfectly pear-shaped ass, or if he hadn\u2019t been drooling over the way her long-legged strides made that perfectly pear-shaped ass shake so jauntily, he might\u2019ve remembered Jessie had warned him that he didn\u2019t know her as well as he thought he did.</p><p>When she turned in the doorway and blew him a kiss, Brandt realized he should\u2019ve listened to her.</p><p>He also understood some things hadn\u2019t changed, namely Jessie\u2019s brotherly feelings toward him. So he\u2019d do as she asked, pretend this night never happened, and continue to stay away from her, as hard as that would be.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Four months later...</p><p>Talk about being a total chickenshit. Here she was, twenty-seven years old, doing her best wallflower imitation again.</p><p>Story of your life, Jessie McKay.</p><p>At least she\u2019d had the foresight to bring along a couple of beers for company. Or solace. Or courage.</p><p>Jessie swigged from the bottle of Corona as she watched the newlyweds swaying to an old George Strait tune. Keely and Jack fit the love song they\u2019d chosen for their first dance as husband and wife. The happy couple only had eyes for each other, despite repeated attempts from Keely\u2019s assorted male family members to cut in. Although Jack used a charming smile to dissuade interruption, a possessive male lurked beneath his polished demeanor.</p><p>Keely deserved a man so perfectly suited for her. A man who worshipped her as a strong-willed cowgirl, but clearly was fierce enough to stand up to her\u2014and her family. Because when you married one McKay, somehow you ended up with them all.</p><p>So it wasn\u2019t a surprise that Jessie was still considered part of the McKay family. Well, most of the McKays. They\u2019d been supportive after Luke\u2019s death, especially during the first month of shock and grief.</p><p>She\u2019d been forced from her home. Forced to find a job. Forced to stand on her own. If it hadn\u2019t been for Luke\u2019s brother Brandt, she might\u2019ve taken the easy way out and driven her truck off a cliff.</p><p>But Brandt became her pillar of support. He helped her, no matter if her problem was big or small. He was there for her like a brother would be. Except one night, a year into her widowhood, Brandt had confessed his feelings for her weren\u2019t merely brotherly.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d been shocked. She\u2019d never looked at Brandt in that light. In her heart, in her mind, she would always be Luke\u2019s wife. She hadn\u2019t known how to explain it without sounding delusional.</p><p>After that night, everything changed between them. Brandt stopped coming over. He\u2019d quit answering her calls. In a moment of clarity a month or so later, she realized it was time to let go.</p><p>In those soul-searching moments, she\u2019d faced a lot of truths, half-truths and untruths. About herself.</p><p>About Luke. About their marriage. Then she\u2019d taken three steps that helped her move on for good.</p><p>One: she\u2019d stopped wearing her wedding ring.</p><p>Two: she\u2019d had the McKay \u201cbrand\u201d tattoo above her ankle reworked into a butterfly emerging from a cocoon.</p><p>Three: she\u2019d decided to have a one-night stand with a complete stranger.</p><p>The last step had been a biggie. Not only had Luke McKay been her first and only lover, Luke also hadn\u2019t been faithful during their marriage. So she\u2019d needed to prove\u2014if only to herself\u2014that she could attract a lover.</p><p>Which was how she\u2019d ended up at the lake last summer when she\u2019d run into Brandt. She hadn\u2019t recognized him at first. She\u2019d never seen Brandt McKay without all his cowboy regalia\u2014boots, jeans, hat.</p><p>She\u2019d definitely never seen him shirtless, barefoot, wearing funky board shorts, looking tanned, fit and unbelievably sexy.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the baby fat Luke had always teased Brandt about was gone, replaced with muscle. Lots of muscle. He\u2019d hacked off his dark, wavy hair in a military buzz cut style. Goatee? Gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soul patch? Gone. Despite the leaner appearance, Brandt\u2019s angular face was still too rugged looking to be considered handsome in the classical sense, like Luke\u2019s had been.</p><p>What hadn\u2019t changed about Brandt? His captivating smile that managed to be both cocky and shy.</p><p>The stunning blueness of his eyes. His overprotective instinct. The first thing he\u2019d done after seeing her for the first time in months was lecture her on hooking up with a douchebag like Mike.</p> <p>At that point, Jessie had told Brandt she was predestined to wind up with douchebags like Mike and Luke, and if he were smart, he\u2019d continue to stay away from her.</p><p>He\u2019d started to argue and she\u2019d glimpsed something dangerous in Brandt\u2019s eyes she\u2019d never noticed.</p><p>But true to form, he\u2019d walked away.</p><p>Or so she\u2019d thought.</p><p>She\u2019d been so eager to convince Mike and his friends she was good-time Jessie the party girl, not a mousy widow with a pathetic past, that she ended up drinking way more than was healthy or smart.</p> <p>The details were hazy through the veil of alcohol. Except for the humiliation of not holding Mike\u2019s sexual interest even when she was naked and willing. Chivalrous Brandt had taken her home. She hadn\u2019t seen or heard from him until today.</p><p>Jessie slumped against the wall. So far she\u2019d been able to avoid talking to him.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019s avoiding talking to you.</p><p>She heard, \u201cMiss Jessie!\u201d and saw her boss\u2019s twin daughters racing toward her.</p><p>Peyton exclaimed, \u201cThere you are,\u201d and attached herself to Jessie\u2019s hip. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you.\u201d</p><p>Not to be outdone, Shannie hugged the other leg and added, \u201cYeah, everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here the whole time.\u201d Jessie whistled. \u201cYou look like princesses in those dresses.\u201d</p><p>Both girls beamed and twirled in a flurry of ribbons, ruffles and frills that adorned their pink and lavender dresses. Not matching dresses. Peyton and Shannie were fraternal twins, but they\u2019d exerted their individuality early on. Since Jessie ran the daycare at Sky Blue, she\u2019d watched these girls over the last two years, always amazed by how different they were from each other, and from their older sister, Eliza.</p><p>Eliza, who was trying to keep up with her dozen or so boy cousins.</p><p>\u201cWill you dance with us?\u201d Shannie asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d Peyton begged.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your mom and dad?\u201d</p><p>Shannie rattled off, \u201cMama is right over there, see? She\u2019s helpin\u2019 Aunt Ginger with her little babies since Daddy and Uncle Buck hadta take Hayden\u2019s grandpa home.\u201d</p><p>Jessie wasn\u2019t surprised Kane and Ginger McKay had brought their twins, Madelyn and Paulson, to Keely\u2019s wedding. Babies abounded at McKay gatherings because there were plenty of hands to help out harried mothers and fathers.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Jessie, can we ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Peyton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come we don\u2019t call you Aunt Jessie? You\u2019re a McKay, just like us, right?\u201d</p><p>Boy howdy. How long had these precocious three-year-olds been waiting for a chance to ask her? She snagged a chair and sat. The girls scrambled onto her lap. \u201cI became a McKay after I married your dad\u2019s cousin Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s in heaven, huh?\u201d Shannie said.</p><p>\u201cYep. Right after he...went to heaven, I started working for your mom at Sky Blue. We decided it\u2019d be too confusing for the other kids in daycare if you two and Eliza called me Aunt Jessie, so we thought it\u2019d be best if everyone called me Miss Jessie.\u201d</p><p>Shannie exchanged a sly look with Peyton before she said, \u201cSo if you don\u2019t got a husband hogging all your time, then you can dance with us.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at their logic. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d The girls hopped down, each grabbed a hand and tugged her onto the dance floor.</p><p>Jessie spun the girls through two songs. When a slow number started, she started to herd them off the dance floor, but Calvin McKay intercepted, scooping both his giggling granddaughters into his arms for a dance.</p><p>Before she reached her table, a firm grip circled her waist and she was towed back to the dance floor.</p><p>Brandt slipped his arms around her\u2014at a proper distance naturally\u2014and said, \u201cThanks for dancin\u2019 with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you gave me a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve said no if I asked, so I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it; she smiled.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s gaze wandered over her face. \u201cYou look beautiful tonight, Jess.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cThank you. You clean up pretty good yourself.\u201d No lie. Brandt wore a black suit with a silver vest. The same silver vest all Keely\u2019s male McKay relatives wore, but he somehow wore it better...which was really saying something.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d</p><p>Lonely. \u201cBusy. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>The song shifted tempo and he slowed them to a gentle sway.</p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful wedding. I\u2019ve never seen Keely so happy,\u201d Jessie murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>They stayed quiet in the moment, just dancing. The song ended and another one began. \u201cI should go,\u201d</p><p>she said, trying to slip from his embrace.</p><p>But Brandt\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cStay. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she wanted was to talk about the fiasco at the lake. \u201cIf in my drunken idiocy I forgot to say thank you for...what you did for me that night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said thank you,\u201d he replied tersely, \u201crepeatedly, and that\u2019s not why I wanna talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank heaven for that. Because God knows I haven\u2019t relived the most embarrassing night of my life in my nightmares enough times in the last four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the one who oughta be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please stop talking about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back.</p><p>He jerked her forward again.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We are gonna talk about this now that you brought it up. Did Mike call you the next day?\u201d</p><p>She knew he wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cYes. He didn\u2019t remember anything, okay? Not a single thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little fucking prick. Do you remember anything?\u201d</p><p>Heat rose in her cheeks. \u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say when he called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you go?\u201d Brandt demanded.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cWhat the hell do you think?\u201d</p><p>He stared back, pulling that silent accusing crap he did so well. Once again she tried to get away from him, once again he didn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>Before Brandt answered, Dalton appeared. \u201cHey, guys. Mind if I cut in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck away, Dalton,\u201d Brandt snarled.</p><p>\u201cLook, people are watching. Dad especially. I ain\u2019t gonna let either of you fuck up Keely\u2019s wedding reception by givin\u2019 Dad the chance to cause a scene. Which we all know he\u2019d love to do. So back the fuck off, Brandt, and let me dance with Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Brandt leaned in and kissed Jessie\u2019s cheek. Then he whispered, \u201cThis ain\u2019t over. Mark my words, Jessie. We will talk, even if I have to hogtie you to make it happen.\u201d He gave them both a feral smile and ambled off the dance floor toward the bar.</p><p>Without missing a beat, Dalton brought her into his arms. \u201cI ain\u2019t gonna ask what the hell that was about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart choice, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be slow, but I ain\u2019t dumb.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed and let him lead. Her relationship with Dalton was more sibling-like than her relationship with Brandt. Dalton still called her every couple of weeks just to shoot the breeze. Last month he\u2019d come over and helped her fix fence, regaling her with tales of his dating life, which always made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, sister, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking dapper yourself, young McKay. Did you bring a date to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019? Bring a woman to a wedding and they immediately start hearin\u2019 wedding bells.</p><p>And I ain\u2019t close to ready to settle down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wild McKay boys are still goin\u2019 strong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it.\u201d He danced them toward the stage. \u201cAlthough, lately, Tell seems to be takin\u2019 a page from Brandt\u2019s book, actin\u2019 like a freakin\u2019 monk.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s pulse jumped. Dalton never talked about Brandt around her. \u201cOh really? A few months back someone mentioned Brandt seeing a woman from Hulett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLydia? She\u2019s old news. They\u2019ve been on-again, off-again for the last ten months.\u201d</p><p>Her immediate burst of jealousy was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cSomething is goin\u2019 on with him. He\u2019s been a real dickhead the last month. I thought maybe he was pissy because he wasn\u2019t getting laid, but I ain\u2019t sure that\u2019s what\u2019s been bugging him. I wondered if he\u2019d said something to you, \u2019cause he sure as hell ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 to me or Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Brandt hasn\u2019t been around much the last year.\u201d</p><p>A blush stole across Dalton\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. I just ain\u2019t surprised.\u201d</p><p>And then Jessie knew. Brandt must\u2019ve told his brothers that she\u2019d turned him down. No wonder Dalton never talked about Brandt around her. In fact, with their Three Musketeers mentality, she was surprised Dalton and Tell stayed in contact with her at all and they hadn\u2019t taken Brandt\u2019s side.</p><p>Tell approached, elbowing Dalton aside. \u201cMy turn. Your girlfriend is lookin\u2019 for you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He whispered something to Dalton that had him blushing beet red.</p><p>\u201cFuck off. I\u2019d punch you in the mouth for even sayin\u2019 that, but Dad would love to see us mixin\u2019 it up, so I\u2019m bein\u2019 the bigger man and walkin\u2019 away.\u201d Dalton made it two steps before he tossed, \u201cAsshole,\u201d over his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuch a loving family,\u201d Jessie muttered as Tell took her hands.</p><p>\u201cMiss us, doncha?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNot touching that one.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cSo what\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d know if you ever bothered to call me.\u201d At his guilty look, she whapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTell.

I got tired of waiting for the right time to get certified and they accepted me as a candidate because of my past rodeo experience. I\u2019ve been studying DVDs and scoring the rides. Then they match how I scored them to the real scores to see how I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t interfered with your ranch work?\u201d</p><p>Tell scowled. \u201cTo hear Dad talk, I\u2019ve all but abandoned the ranch. Hell. I\u2019m gone one day, two at the most in a month. Brandt and Dalton ain\u2019t complaining. And since Brandt\u2019s pretty much in charge, he\u2019s the one I\u2019m the most concerned with. The season\u2019s almost over. Dad\u2019s just pissy because I\u2019m headin\u2019 to the NFR in December for a week\u2019s worth of hands-on classes.\u201d</p><p>Casper had always condemned any activity that took his sons away from the ranch. She remembered Luke saying that Tell could\u2019ve gone pro in saddle bronc or bareback riding, but Casper wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>Of all Casper\u2019s sons, Tell was the peacemaker. So this new direction in his life, against his father\u2019s wishes, surprised her and she said as much.</p><p>\u201cAfter Luke died, I realized that Dad wouldn\u2019t ever be happy again about anything any of us did. I decided to do what I want and he can deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie studied him. Tell resembled Luke more than either Brandt or Dalton, but he had the same world-weary look she\u2019d seen on Brandt. \u201cAre things any better between you guys and your dad?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWorse, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d Tell smiled. \u201cSo let\u2019s look like we\u2019re havin\u2019 a blast out here on the dance floor, eh?</p><p>That oughta really piss Casper off good.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>As soon as the dance ended, she booked it to the women\u2019s bathroom. Halfway down the hall, she felt a hand on her shoulder. She didn\u2019t have to turn around to know it was Brandt.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he just leave her alone?</p> <p>\u201cJessie. Wait.\u201d</p><p>She spun to face him, shrugging out of his hold. \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talked out.\u201d She wheeled back around...and found herself pushed against the wall with Brandt in her face.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, this is really important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is the fact I was on my way to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and his grip on her biceps increased. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Spit out what is so important that I\u2019m not even allowed to pee first.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her with that wordless threat.</p><p>She\u2019d had enough of his tough guy attitude. \u201cLet me go...or I\u2019ll punch you in the stomach.\u201d</p><p>His shock gave way to a smarmy grin. \u201cPunch me? You? Sweet Jessie? I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve never hit another person in your life.\u201d</p><p>Mistake.</p><p>Jessie released a fast, hard uppercut to his solar plexus that immediately had him falling back to clutch his gut. She leaned closer and hissed, \u201cI might not\u2019ve hit a person, but I own a punching bag now, so back off.\u201d</p><p>A gasp echoed and she looked up to see Keely and AJ McKay staring at them in openmouthed horror.</p><p>Shit. \u201cSorry, Keely. I didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo punch Brandt in the stomach? That was an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No. I meant to do that. I didn\u2019t mean to cause a scene and I...really have to wash my hands.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s gaze darted between them. \u201cOkay. Don\u2019t be too long. I\u2019m about to throw the bouquet.\u201d</p><p>Like that was an incentive not to run out of here screaming. Jessie watched Keely and AJ disappear into a dressing room and hightailed it to the ladies room, not sparing Brandt a second glance.</p><p>She hid out as long as she could\u2014or at least until all the wedding guests were occupied with the tossing of the bouquet.</p><p>As soon as the coast was clear, she snuck out the back door and drove straight home.</p><p>Take that, Brandt McKay. I won\u2019t talk to you if I don\u2019t want to and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Brandt couldn\u2019t believe Jessie had snuck out.</p><p>He really couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d sucker punched him.</p><p>Not a sucker punch if she warned you.</p><p>True.</p><p>Fifteen minutes after she\u2019d socked him a good one, he\u2019d noticed she hadn\u2019t returned to the reception.</p><p>He checked the parking lot and saw her pickup was gone.</p><p>Brandt had left immediately.</p><p>The drive to her place had been little more than a blur. He knew when he\u2019d cut the truck\u2019s headlights and pulled into her driveway that she hadn\u2019t gone to bed yet. Even if her trailer had been completely dark he\u2019d still be standing on her porch, ready to rip the damn door off the hinges if she didn\u2019t answer his knock.</p><p>A knock, which she\u2019d ignored for the fifth time.</p><p>Screw it. Jessie already thought he was heavy handed, so he used that heavy hand to beat on the aluminum siding. \u201cI ain\u2019t leavin\u2019 Jessie, so open up.\u201d</p><p>Lexie barked inside and Jessie shushed her as the door swung inward.</p><p>His braced himself, half-expecting she\u2019d be aiming a shotgun at him.</p><p>Why that thought heated his blood just proved how twisted he was when it came to his conflicted feelings about his former sister-in-law.</p><p>But Jessie wasn\u2019t packing heat. She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at him through the screen door. \u201cDid you bring the ropes to hogtie me with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. I\u2019m comin\u2019 in.\u201d</p><p>She muttered, \u201cTypical McKay macho bullshit ,\u201d and unlocked the screen door.</p><p>Any relief that she\u2019d relented to listen to him vanished when he remembered what he had to tell her.</p><p>Inside, he absentmindedly patted Lexie\u2019s head and watched Jessie grab two beers out of the fridge.</p><p>She passed him a bottle on her way to sit on the couch.</p><p>She\u2019d changed out of the slinky gray cocktail dress and into baggy red sweatpants and a black sports bra that molded to her upper torso, emphasizing the slenderness of her shoulders, the gentle curve of her breasts and the flatness of her belly. Damn woman looked good no matter what she wore.</p><p>Or didn\u2019t wear. The image of her naked in his arms had been permanently burned into his memory banks, but oddly, that wasn\u2019t the first thing that popped into his head whenever he saw her. Usually the word mine flashed behind his eyes in big red letters, and that was just all kinds of fucked up.</p><p>By the time she faced him, he\u2019d managed a bland expression.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s gaze dropped to his stomach. \u201cSorry for punching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was there and gone. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to tell you something.\u201d At her uncomfortable look, he held up his hand. \u201cI promise it doesn\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with the embarrassing way I threw myself at your feet last year.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember. I just...didn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for that,\u201d he muttered, swigging his beer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, that you had to chase me down at eleven o\u2019clock on a Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>Blurt it out.</p><p>No, break it to her gently.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d Fuck. This was gonna suck ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came across some information... Well, that ain\u2019t exactly true. I wasn\u2019t the one who made initial contact... Ah hell. I\u2019m doin\u2019 this all wrong.\u201d He chugged another drink of beer. \u201cLast month a woman called me. She said she knew Luke.\u201d</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t speak. She just blinked those amazing baby blues at him.</p><p>\u201cShe said she knew Luke intimately, so intimately in fact, that he\u2019d knocked her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis woman claimed she\u2019d been sleepin\u2019 with Luke and didn\u2019t know she was pregnant until after he died.\u201d</p><p>Every bit of color drained from Jessie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cShe said she broke it off with him a week before his accident. When she discovered she was pregnant...somehow she\u2019d heard you got kicked off the ranch. She figured she\u2019d get the same treatment from Luke\u2019s family, and get nothin\u2019 but grief from you, so she didn\u2019t tell anyone Luke was the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Jessie spat. \u201cShe knew carrying the baby of a dead man was worth something.\u201d</p><p>Brandt shook his head. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she knew Luke was a married man when she slept with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. There\u2019s no excuse for that. But I will tell you, she\u2019s young, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just turned twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened. \u201cThat bastard Luke was fucking a nineteen-year-old girl?\u201d</p><p>Hearing such crude words from Jessie caused Brandt to flinch. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is the kid now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty damn convenient, if you ask me. Luke\u2019s been dead for two years. There\u2019s no way to prove...\u201d Jessie\u2019s sharp gaze pierced right through him. \u201cYou have a guilty look on your face, Brandt McKay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I did demand proof. Right away. I contacted Dr. Monroe and she put me in contact with a place that specializes in fast paternity tests. Long story short, Landon is Luke\u2019s child. But really, all I had to do was look at the kid and I knew.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s tough shell cracked and her face crumpled. \u201cOh God. No. This is not happening.\u201d</p><p>Brandt was beside her in an instant. He wanted so badly to pull her into his arms, offer her comfort, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure she wouldn\u2019t slap and claw at him, taking her rage out on the messenger since she couldn\u2019t take it out on the person who deserved it.</p> <p>Goddamn you, Luke. What the fuck were you thinking?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been. As usual his brother thought of himself first.</p><p>Jessie hugged her knees to her chest, hiding her face beneath her tangle of hair. Her shoulders shook as she rocked on the couch.</p><p>Brandt was helpless to do anything but watch her fall apart.</p><p>Lexie came over, whining at her mistress\u2019s distress, but even the dog seemed at a loss.</p> <p>He drained his beer. Then he got up and grabbed another. Staring out the window, his thoughts as jumbled now, as when Samantha Johnston had contacted him six weeks ago.</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t told anyone in his family about meeting Samantha and Landon. It\u2019d been ripping him up inside to the point he was pretty sure he\u2019d given himself an ulcer.</p><p>He lifted the bottle to his lips only to come up empty. He\u2019d sucked down the whole damn thing without thinking about it, without tasting it\u2014which was why he hadn\u2019t been drinking the last month. It\u2019d be too easy to wind up drunk every damn night, without intending to.</p><p>\u201cAm I the last one to know about Luke\u2019s secret love child?\u201d Jessie asked.</p><p>Her tear-choked voice startled him. \u201cNo. Hell no. I wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d He crossed the room and sat next to her. \u201cYou\u2019re the first one I\u2019ve told. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019ve told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me first? Why not Tell or Dalton or your folks?\u201d</p> <p>How did he phrase this?</p><p>You\u2019ve gone too far to worry about sparing her feelings now.</p><p>\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t happy news for you, Jess.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth trembled and he watched as she fought to stop it. She inhaled. Exhaled. \u201cBut it will be happy news for them.\u201d</p><p>Brandt nodded.</p><p>\u201cJesus. This is a nightmare. Just when I think it can\u2019t get worse, it does. Just when I think Luke McKay can\u2019t possibly hurt me any more than he already has, he does.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t dispute it, which forced her to meet his gaze.</p><p>She paled further, if that were possible. \u201cIt gets worse, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfraid so. Look, Samantha has had a rough go of it. She\u2019s young, a single parent with no one to turn to, so she\u2019s made some mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of mistakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got a DUI when Landon was six months old. She managed mostly to stay on the straight and narrow...until two months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a second DUI.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cAre you joking?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIs that why she contacted you? To bail her out of jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She contacted me after the arrest because she knew she\u2019d be sent to jail. She moved away from the guy she\u2019d shacked up with and moved back in with her aunt. But the aunt can\u2019t take care of Landon. So she needs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. Please tell me you didn\u2019t volunteer to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice do I have?\u201d He stood and paced to the door and back. \u201cIf one of Landon\u2019s blood relatives doesn\u2019t take him, her aunt will turn the child over to Protective Services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like the kid will be a helluva lot better off with a child protection agency than with her,\u201d</p><p>Jessie snapped.</p><p>Brandt froze. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. She\u2019s a perfect example of why there are these types of agencies, Brandt. Let them deal with her and with the kid. They\u2019re more qualified to make a rational decision about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only living link I\u2019ll ever have to my dead brother? I\u2019m just supposed to say, oh well, not my problem? Not care? He\u2019s little more than a baby, Jess. None of this is his fault. Don\u2019t you see that? I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t walk away. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You can\u2019t. I get that. But I don\u2019t understand what any of this has to do with me.\u201d</p><p>Here was the moment of truth. He knelt in front of her. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t do this by myself. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. God. No. Stop. Brandt. Please. Just stop.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face was killing him, but somehow he soldiered on. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary situation. Just a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. You really aren\u2019t asking me to help you take care of my dead husband\u2019s illegitimate child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d She shoved him aside so hard he fell on his ass and she raced to the kitchen sink.</p><p>Her retching sounds, mixed with her heartbreaking sobs, made his eyes burn and his throat tighten.</p><p>He was asking the impossible of her. He knew that. But he also knew that Jessie had the kindest soul and the purest heart of anyone he\u2019d ever known. That\u2019s why he hated how his brother had treated her. And it pissed him off that Luke still had the power to hurt her\u2014to hurt both of them\u2014from beyond the grave.</p><p>Brandt wasn\u2019t a religious man, but maybe there was a reason this child had happened and a reason why Samantha had come to him for help. He had to believe this shitty situation would mean something good in the end. Because if he thought too hard about the cruelty of it, he\u2019d go stark raving mad. Hell. He was almost there.</p><p>He picked himself up off the floor and went to her. Jessie didn\u2019t shrink away when he wrapped his arms around her. She turned and burrowed into his chest, sobbing.</p><p>Brandt held her and let his tears fall along right with hers.</p><p>Finally, she whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he soothed. \u201cI\u2019m only askin\u2019 you to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? By forcing me?\u201d</p><p>He tipped her chin up. \u201cI\u2019d never force you. You know me better than that.\u201d</p><p>Again, she looked away. Again, Brandt lifted her chin and studied her eyes. The misery was still there, but something else was too. Something that resembled anger. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me, Brandt? Why am I the first person you thought of?\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re the most caring person I know.</p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of punishment?\u201d</p><p>Confused, he frowned. \u201cPunishment? Why would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I hurt you. Then you cut me out of your life completely. And you can deny it all you want-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not denyin\u2019 that you hurt me, Jessie. But I was the one outta line, not you. I was mad at myself, not at you.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s entire face held an expression of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m usin\u2019 this as an opportunity to get back at you? To hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m asking,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cChrist, just bringing the goddamn thing to your attention is hurting you. I can see that. You think I like the way you\u2019re lookin\u2019 at me right now? No. But I remember you looked at me the same way right after Luke died. I remember how we helped each other through it. One day at a time. How bein\u2019 together somehow made it...bearable at times.\u201d He closed his eyes against the pain in hers. \u201cDo you remember the night you told me you wouldn\u2019t have survived that first year if it hadn\u2019t been for me? How you owed me and if I ever needed anything from you, all I had to do was ask? Well, Jess, right now, I\u2019m askin\u2019 you. I\u2019m begging you. Please. I need you to help me do this.\u201d</p><p>After a minute or so of hellish silence, she burrowed into him again. Her tears soaked his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do it. I need some time, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to say it, but that\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t give you. I\u2019m picking Landon up tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re just telling me now? This is going way too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t intended to spring this on you. But Samantha\u2019s sentencing was moved up last week. She went to the women\u2019s correctional facility in Lusk on Wednesday. Her aunt agreed to keep Landon only for a few days. If I don\u2019t go get him tomorrow...\u201d</p><p>Jessie jerked back. \u201cWhy is her aunt being so difficult?\u201d</p><p>His hand shook as he brushed baby-fine strands of hair from her tear-stained face. \u201cShe\u2019s actually her great aunt, who\u2019s nearly eighty and is almost legally blind. It was easier takin\u2019 care of baby contained in a crib. But now that Landon is walking, she literally cannot keep an eye on him.\u201d That wasn\u2019t all, but Brandt wasn\u2019t about to put the cart before the horse.</p><p>So he shouldn\u2019t have been surprised Jessie connected the dots.</p><p>\u201cThe aunt is afraid this isn\u2019t a temporary arrangement. She\u2019s worried she\u2019ll get stuck with the kid permanently.\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t bother to lie. \u201cI\u2019m assuming so. Like I said, Samantha has made some mistakes, but I\u2019m not writing her off completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. God. Why couldn\u2019t she have given him up for adoption?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say he felt the same, because he didn\u2019t. Even as much as it hurt Jessie, Brandt was glad Samantha had contacted him. He dropped his hands and stepped back. \u201cLook. I know this is a lot to process. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I refuse? What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll...\u201d He blew out an exasperated breath. \u201cHave no choice except to ask my parents to pitch in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was Jessie\u2019s horror-filled look. \u201cBut Casper\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the worst possible choice, yeah, trust me, I know. My mother would be fine takin\u2019 care of Landon, but she won\u2019t stand up to my father, which means I\u2019d have to leave Landon at their house. Every goddamn day. And I don\u2019t trust my dad not to go around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo around you how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGiven Samantha\u2019s circumstances, he\u2019ll try for full custody of Landon, and the court would award them guardianship, even temporarily, over me. I don\u2019t want it to come to that. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you plan on telling them about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. I\u2019d hoped to have a firm plan in place first, but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll wing it. Tell and Dalton will back me up, no matter what happens.\u201d</p><p>In the unbearably long, brutal silence, Brandt felt his hope drying up. Felt her pulling away.</p><p>Shivering, Jessie wrapped her arms around herself. \u201cIt\u2019s late. And I\u2019m...\u201d</p> <p>In shock. Heartbroken. Angry.</p><p>Every emotion was written on her face. \u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cYes,\u201d then amended, \u201cunless you\u2019re too tired to drive home. You can crash on the couch.</p><p>But you won\u2019t get much sleep. It\u2019s the last thing on my mind right about now.\u201d</p><p>When Jessie was upset, she cleaned house like a maniac. He\u2019d rather sleep in his damn truck than surround himself with her strange compulsion and the smell of bleach. He snagged his suit coat off the back of the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll go. Think about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>She looked him dead in the eye and said, \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll think of anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie didn\u2019t sleep. She paced to the point it annoyed her dog. She drank two shots of whiskey and the booze stopped the shaking in her hands, but didn\u2019t blot out the surrealness of the situation.</p><p>Luke had a child.</p><p>With someone else.</p><p>That alone would\u2019ve been bad enough, if not for the fact she\u2019d lost a baby. Every problem they\u2019d ever had stemmed from that unintended pregnancy, which had forced them to get married. She\u2019d miscarried at four months, after getting thrown off her horse. Luke hadn\u2019t been devastated at the loss of the child as much as she had.</p><p>No, his devastation came from being trapped in a shotgun marriage.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s suggestion that she remain at home to heal gave Luke an excuse to go out. While he\u2019d been carousing in honkytonks in four counties, she\u2019d been the dutiful wife.</p><p>He\u2019d been so sweet and loving to her at times she wondered if she\u2019d exaggerated his surliness when he wasn\u2019t around. She\u2019d wanted to try for another baby right away, but the doctor suggested she wait a year and put her on birth control pills. Which had re-ignited their sex life for a while. But she hadn\u2019t been enough for him. He\u2019d gone elsewhere to satisfy his sexual needs.</p><p>She\u2019d stumbled upon evidence of the first affair by accident. She hadn\u2019t confronted him about it. She just tried harder to satisfy him\u2014in bed and out\u2014hoping it\u2019d keep him home.</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t. As the months wore on, it was almost as if Luke wanted to get caught. He wanted Jessie to know he\u2019d been with other women. He hadn\u2019t tried to hide it from anyone, including his family. Casper McKay had been snide about it. Joan looked at her with pity. Dalton and Tell skirted the subject. But Brandt had seethed.</p><p>One afternoon Brandt had yelled at Luke for screwing around on her. Luke told Brandt to mind his own goddamn business and he could screw whoever he wanted. When Brandt insisted Jessie deserved better, Luke had laughed, warning Brandt that he wasn\u2019t the better man, and if Brandt ever touched Jessie, Luke would kill him. Neither man knew Jessie watched in misery from the shadows of the barn.</p><p>She\u2019d never understood why Brandt had stood up for her. It wasn\u2019t like they\u2019d known each other before she\u2019d married Luke. She\u2019d never understood why Luke had threatened Brandt over her, because she wasn\u2019t the type to turn heads or inspire fierce loyalty. Or fidelity.</p><p>So the question on her mind now: Would he have left her for this Samantha girl once he\u2019d found out she carried his child?</p><p>No. Luke would\u2019ve bucked up to his responsibility for the kid, but he wouldn\u2019t put himself in a repeat situation of being stuck in a relationship because of a child.</p><p>What a mess.</p><p>Imagining her husband in bed with another woman was bad enough. But seeing the proof of his passion? Of seeing the physical embodiment of what he\u2019d denied her but he\u2019d given to someone else?</p><p>She felt hollow. Totally eviscerated.</p><p>How could she look at the child with anything but loathing?</p><p>Brandt\u2019s words, He\u2019s little more than a baby, Jess, none of this is his fault, rang in her head and slashed at her heartstrings.</p><p>She would not feel guilty. She owed this Samantha girl nothing. She owed Luke nothing.</p><p>But she owed Brandt McKay everything.</p><p>Didn\u2019t she?</p><p>She\u2019d just gotten her life back on track on her own terms. She owed it to herself not to suffer through the heartbreak of wishing the little boy was hers. Of getting pissed off because he should\u2019ve been hers. Of resenting Luke because he should\u2019ve left her pregnant, not some strange teenager.</p><p>So when Brandt called tomorrow, she\u2019d tell him no.</p><p>She\u2019d scream no if she had to.</p><p>But she would say no.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>When Brandt pulled up to Jessie\u2019s place late the next morning, she didn\u2019t immediately exit the house.</p><p>He waited in his truck, listening to Landon\u2019s soft snuffles drifting from the rear cab. The boy had screamed from the time he\u2019d left his aunt\u2019s house until ten minutes ago when he\u2019d conked out.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>He hoped the kid would be on his best behavior, all cute smiles and big blue eyes, because Brandt didn\u2019t want to give Jessie a reason to say no.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say no. She was the key to everything.</p><p>Brandt unbuckled Landon and lifted him out of the car seat. He adjusted the hood covering Landon\u2019s head and cuddled him against his body to block the wind. At the last second he remembered the diaper bag.</p><p>Kids came with a lot of stuff.</p><p>Fine flakes of snow pelted him in the face as he climbed the stairs. He stood in front of the door, figuring he\u2019d use his foot to knock on the bottom aluminum panel if need be.</p><p>But the door opened and Jessie stared at him through the screen. Her eyes never left his, never strayed to the sleeping child on Brandt\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSo much for not forcing me, huh Brandt? You just show up on my doorstep?\u201d</p><p>This did not bode well.</p><p>After glaring at him, she held the door open and shushed Lexie\u2019s excited barks.</p><p>He put Landon onto the couch, wedging him against the middle couch cushion facing out. He unzipped the tiny winter coat and tried to rearrange the hood, but the kid didn\u2019t seem to mind it, so he left it as is rather than risk waking him. Turning around, he expected to see Jessie behind him, but she\u2019d shooed Lexie outside and retreated to the kitchen.</p><p>Brandt ditched his coat and followed her.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d</p><p>After she poured his cup, she leaned against the counter, keeping her back to the living room. Keeping her back to Landon.</p><p>He searched her face. Dark circles hung beneath her eyes, the only color on her too pale skin. Her lips were drawn in a tight line, as were her eyebrows. She looked like one wrong word would shatter her. \u201cDid you sleep at all?\u201d</p><p>Jessie shrugged. \u201cI think I dozed off around dawn, but then I had to get up and feed the animals.\u201d She blew across her coffee. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same.\u201d He\u2019d lain in his bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to make plans for the next few months\u2014a pointless endeavor, when everything was up in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat time are you meeting your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re just gonna spring this on them too?\u201d</p><p>He felt his face heat. \u201cNot an ideal situation, but I\u2019m in limbo until you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis decision shouldn\u2019t be on my shoulders,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. But your answer does have an affect on what I do next.\u201d</p><p>Her chin dropped to her chest and she gazed into her coffee mug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment lodged in his gut like a stone. \u201cJessie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brandt. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The remainder of her sentence was lost in Landon\u2019s cry.</p><p>He set aside his mug and crossed to the couch. Landon had already pushed himself upright and was looking around with confusion. Brandt dropped to his haunches, keeping the kid from scrambling down.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. Didja have a nice nap?\u201d</p><p>Those somber blue eyes studied him as Brandt removed the little guy\u2019s coat.</p><p>\u201cI brought some of your toys.\u201d</p><p>But Landon held up his arms.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I guess you\u2019d rather be picked up.\u201d Brandt settled the boy on his hip and turned around.</p><p>Jessie had her back to him as she faced out the front window.</p><p>Disappointment warred with panic. If she wouldn\u2019t even look at the kid, there was no way she\u2019d help him. No way.</p><p>Lexie scratched at the door and Brandt automatically let her in, like he\u2019d done a hundred times when he used to visit Jessie. The dog jumped and yipped at seeing Landon.</p><p>Landon clapped his hands and laughed\u2014a pure, innocent burst of joy that made Brandt grin. \u201cA boy who likes dogs, imagine that.\u201d Brandt sat in the easy chair with Landon on his lap. He patted his leg.</p><p>\u201cCome on over and say hello, Lexie.\u201d</p><p>The dog slunk over to sniff Landon\u2019s toes. He giggled again and reached for Lexie\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there, partner. Gotta be gentle. Play nice. Touch her like this, see?\u201d Brandt kept one arm wrapped around Landon\u2019s middle as he petted Lexie\u2019s back. He took Landon\u2019s hand and slowly moved it across Lexie\u2019s fur. \u201cShe likes that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Landon\u2019s whole body wiggled, he was so excited.</p><p>So Brandt kept helping the boy pet the dog, keeping Lexie\u2019s head and teeth away from Landon\u2019s poking fingers. He shot a glance toward Jessie, but she hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>Come on, Jess. You can do this. I know you can.</p> <p>Three things happened while he was silently begging Jessie to look at them. His cell phone rang in his back pocket. As he shifted to reach for it, he stepped on Lexie\u2019s tail. She yipped and scampered away, heading toward Jessie. When he loosened his hold on Landon, the monkey kid jumped down and raced after the dog.</p><p>But Lexie had wormed her way between Jessie and the kitchen cabinet. Before Brandt could catch Landon, he smacked into the back of Jessie\u2019s calves, squealing, determined to get a hold of the dog.</p><p>Startled, Jessie spun around and knocked Landon to the floor. He landed with a thud on his diapered butt and cried out.</p><p>The rest of it happened in slow motion.</p><p>Jessie instinctively picked him up, with a reassuring, \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d and smoothed her hand over his dark head.</p> <p>Brandt watched, not breathing, as Jessie realized what she\u2019d done.</p><p>A tiny gasp escaped. Her hand froze, as if the kid had suddenly become radioactive, but her gaze tracked every inch of Landon\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cMy God. I can\u2019t believe how much he looks like Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little spooky.\u201d He took another step closer. \u201cI\u2019ll take him, if you want.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed with difficulty. \u201cNo. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>Tell her she doing great.</p><p>The words stuck in his throat. An excruciatingly long minute passed before he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019m working on it, Brandt. Just give me a second.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He\u2019d give her all the time she needed.</p><p>Jessie hiked Landon higher on her hip. He seemed to be studying Jessie as closely as she was studying him.</p><p>Then Landon pointed to a package of crackers on the counter and grunted.</p><p>\u201cHas he eaten anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot since I\u2019ve picked him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have food allergies?\u201d</p><p>Brandt scratched his chin. \u201cNot that she mentioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she left instructions.\u201d She wandered into the living room and rummaged in the diaper bag.</p><p>Landon started to fuss when she pulled out an empty bottle. She frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s still on a bottle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Is that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost kids I\u2019ve dealt with have been weaned by this age. But I\u2019ll be the first to admit all kids develop differently, so I\u2019m not sure.\u201d She dug out a can of baby formula and studied it. \u201cThis is a special formula for underweight toddlers. It has more nutrients than regular formula.\u201d When Jessie realized she\u2019d been babbling, she backtracked, \u201cI only know this because one of the kids at Sky Blue was on this formula until she turned two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d Brandt murmured.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She passed Landon to him. \u201cEntertain him while I fix his bottle.\u201d</p><p>Lexie decided to give Landon another chance and let herself be petted, patted and pulled on. By the time Jessie brought the full bottle over, Landon was antsy for it.</p><p>Brandt held Landon while the kid sucked down his bottle, keeping an eye on Jessie.</p><p>She sat in the couch, knees drawn to her chest. Her gaze hadn\u2019t wandered from Landon for several long minutes. \u201cYou knew once I saw him I wouldn\u2019t say no, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d hoped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I need to know if you\u2019re really on board with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s temporary, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Samantha was sentenced to two months in jail in Lusk and two months in a halfway house in Casper. Which might actually end up less time if she exhibits good behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re looking at four months before she\u2019s out and can take him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoughly.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head back and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this...but okay. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>Brandt nearly shouted with relief. \u201cYou are an amazing woman, Jess. Thank you, for doin\u2019 this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you sing my praises, I have a couple of conditions that we can talk about after I hear the plan you\u2019ve sketched out with me on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ve got more than one plan?\u201d</p><p>Jessie gave him a wry look. \u201cBecause I know you, Brandt McKay. You prepare for every possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly a go with the flow kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing. In fact, it\u2019s a better trait than impulsiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always say that.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI figured since you work in a daycare, and if Skylar was okay with it, you could take Landon to work with you. Not every day. Three days a week.\u201d Brandt suspected it\u2019d be harder to convince Jessie than her boss Skylar, married to Brandt\u2019s cousin Kade, to agree to the arrangement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be good for him to be around other kids. I\u2019m no expert, but he seems to be behind in stuff, like...talking.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard him say no and mama and goggie, which means doggie as far as I can tell. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I take Landon to daycare with me, I won\u2019t be spending all my time with him teaching him to talk. In fact, it\u2019ll present a conflict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Sky hired me, she changed the daycare structure. Before, because each employee had kids, they had to rotate into the daycare for a week. But since I don\u2019t have kids and wasn\u2019t trained for factory work, she made me fulltime in the daycare. I won\u2019t put Sky in the position of assuring her employees\u2014</p><p>who are also my friends\u2014that Landon won\u2019t be getting all my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone who knows you, Jess, understands you won\u2019t play favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to flatter me. I already said yes.\u201d She ran an agitated hand through her hair. \u201cWhat happens after the five o\u2019clock whistle blows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I\u2019m done workin\u2019 on the ranch during the week, I\u2019ll be at your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night?\u201d</p><p>Was that alarm in her tone? \u201cYes. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say a dang thing about moving in with me, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t movin\u2019 in with you either.\u201d He gave her his most charming grin.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even crack a smile.</p><p>\u201cTo be blunt, my place is too far away. It doesn\u2019t make sense for us to drive back and forth a couple times a day. I\u2019ll be here after you get off work to take care of him, including anything he needs at night. In the morning you guys will go to Sky Blue, I\u2019ll head to the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some other reason you\u2019re insisting on this happening here at my place, so spill it.\u201d</p><p>Brandt sighed. \u201cIt\u2019d be easier for everyone if I wasn\u2019t livin\u2019 so close to my folks while he\u2019s under my guardianship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I can see where it\u2019d be so much better if you tell Casper you\u2019re living with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I didn\u2019t think that one through, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jessie\u2019s eyes kept wandering to Landon. \u201cI just want you to make sure they both understand that this was not my idea, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as long as we\u2019re heading down this road, I have a few conditions. First, I will not have any contact with Landon\u2019s mother. Period. You will deal with her. I don\u2019t want to hear about how she\u2019s doing in jail or any of her problems. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, I will not have any contact with Casper. Your mom? Fine. Casper. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. Which is why it\u2019ll be best that I stay here for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird, I\u2019m done in four months. Regardless of what Landon\u2019s mother does, or what you\u2019ve promised her beyond that, my part in helping you is finished.\u201d Brandt started to speak, but she cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding about this. Four months. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I won\u2019t have to spell it out to you that I won\u2019t be doing everything myself for this kid, like feeding him, changing him, entertaining him, plus all the regular household stuff I already do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why don\u2019t you have to spell it out for me?\u201d</p><p>Jessie looked away. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not like Luke. For the record, that\u2019s a compliment. You\u2019d never ask me to help you and then abandon me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Luke had been awesome at that. He\u2019d called it delegating. Everyone else called it bullshit.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLast thing. You won\u2019t bring women into my house and no expecting me to baby-sit while you\u2019re out on the town.\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked at her sharply but kept his voice down. \u201cJesus, Jessie, you really think I\u2019d bring another woman into your home? You think I\u2019m that heartless I wouldn\u2019t give a damn about your feelings just so I could get my rocks off? Wrong, especially now that I\u2019m\u2014\u201d He snapped his mouth shut, just in time.</p><p>Dammit, he\u2019d almost been goaded into admitting that he was exactly where he wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat Brandt? Now that...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019m forced to pick up the pieces of Luke\u2019s stupidity once again. The thought of me causin\u2019</p><p>more shit for you to deal with rips me apart, Jess. What don\u2019t you understand about that?\u201d</p><p>By her startled look, she hadn\u2019t foreseen that answer. Then again, he hadn\u2019t expected Jessie to make demands of her own. And he had a sneaking suspicion she wasn\u2019t done making demands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evidently Brandt hadn\u2019t been successful in keeping his voice down. Landon\u2019s eyes popped open and he wiggled until he was sitting on Brandt\u2019s lap.</p><p>Jessie stood. \u201cI\u2019ve said my piece, you\u2019ve said yours. Can we just move onto the next thing? Because there\u2019s plenty of other stuff we have to deal with today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He squinted at the clock. \u201cI need to get goin\u2019. I\u2019m supposed to meet my brothers at my place in an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Skylar and give her a heads up, but it\u2019d probably be best if I drove out there and talked to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He reached for Landon\u2019s coat. \u201cCome on buddy. Let\u2019s ride.\u201d</p><p>Jessie insisted on meeting Skylar face to face because she had the overwhelming urge to put distance between herself and Brandt.</p><p>Don\u2019t you mean between you and Landon?</p><p>What\u2019d happened to her backbone? She\u2019d sworn last night she\u2019d say no. She\u2019d said it out loud. Hell, she\u2019d screamed it. No one in the world would blame her for washing her hands of the situation. In fact, now she\u2019d have the exact opposite problem. People in the community would think she was a masochist or a martyr.</p> <p>But when she\u2019d seen that sweet little innocent face...something shifted inside her. Something big.</p><p>Something beyond pity or a sense of duty. Something she was afraid to put a name to.</p><p>She turned off the highway and bypassed the Sky Blue manufacturing plant. Seemed strange to drive past it and through the gate that divided the manufacturing plant are from Kade and Skylar McKay\u2019s private residence. As handy as it was for Skylar to have her business so close to her home, she kept the two buildings separated.</p><p>Girls and dogs raced up as soon as Jessie parked.</p><p>\u201cMiss Jessie,\u201d Peyton exclaimed. \u201cMama said you were comin\u2019 here.\u201d She stood on tiptoe and peered around Jessie.</p><p>\u201cSomeone else you\u2019re looking for, Peyton?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s checkin\u2019 to see if you brought the llamas, which is just stupid,\u201d Eliza drawled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tellin\u2019 Mama you called me stupid,\u201d Peyton shot back.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Shannie stepped between her warring sisters. \u201cStop or Daddy won\u2019t take us ridin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019ll tattle,\u201d Eliza said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Peyton added. \u201cYou got us all in trouble last night.\u201d</p><p>Three dogs sniffed Jessie as three girls argued.</p><p>The screen door slammed and Skylar started down the steps, followed by Kade.</p> <p>The girls\u2019 fighting ended immediately and they lined up, all sweet smiles, the pictures of innocence.</p><p>Jessie bit her cheek to keep from laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jess. It\u2019s good to see you, but you didn\u2019t have to drive out here.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she was interrupting some family thing. \u201cOh, if this is a bad time, I can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Skylar assured her, \u201cit\u2019s fine. Actually, I\u2019m happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>Kade set his hands on Skylar\u2019s shoulders and spoke to his daughters. \u201cYou girls get the tack ready for the horses and I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay. Bye!\u201d All three girls took off, boots clomping on the gravel, pigtails flying as they raced each other to the barn.</p><p>Before Jessie uttered a word, Kade demanded, \u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about Luke havin\u2019 a kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade,\u201d Skylar murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo sense in beatin\u2019 around the bush, Sky.\u201d</p><p>Jessie jammed her hands in the pockets of her vest. \u201cObviously it was news to me too, but Brandt has been dealing with the boy\u2019s mother for the last month.\u201d She relayed the story, knowing she\u2019d better get used to telling it, even when the news would spread through the McKay family like wildfire.</p><p>Both Kade and Skylar were quiet, yet Jessie could sense some silent communication between them.</p><p>Kade sighed. \u201cHell, Jessie. I don\u2019t even know what to say. I\u2019m sorry none of us can kick Luke\u2019s ass for what he done. But I\u2019d be lyin\u2019 if I didn\u2019t tell you I wanna kick Brandt\u2019s butt for even suggesting that you be a party to takin\u2019 care of this kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d have to get in line. Not to mention how Casper...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper can shut his big goddamn mouth, as far as I\u2019m concerned. He\u2019s never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKade,\u201d Skylar said, stopping his tirade. \u201cThis isn\u2019t helping. Go hit the trail with the girls. They\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Kade held Jessie eyes with a sympathetic look from beneath his gray cowboy hat. \u201cIf you need anything at all, just ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kade. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Kade kissed his wife and sauntered off.</p><p>Skylar grabbed Jessie\u2019s shirtsleeve. \u201cI made iced tea. Or maybe you\u2019d prefer something stronger?\u201d</p><p>Jessie shook her head. \u201cTea would be fine. I think if I start drinking I won\u2019t stop and that won\u2019t help anyone.\u201d</p><p>After they settled in wicker rockers in the three-season porch, Skylar sighed. \u201cI thought the girls would sleep in this morning after their late night at the wedding reception, but they were up at the crack of dawn, as usual. They definitely take after their father in that respect.\u201d</p><p>How would Landon take after Luke? Just in looks? Or in temperament?</p><p>Jessie braced herself for more questions because Skylar wouldn\u2019t pull any punches.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m taking advantage of the situation, but there\u2019s something else I needed to talk to you about anyway.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound very good. \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not even close. Despite the circumstances that brought you to Sky Blue, Jessie, I\u2019m thrilled to have you working for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut it seems the dynamic in the daycare has changed in the last year. I\u2019ve always had the daycare for just my employee\u2019s children, but with those kids growing up we\u2019ve got vacancies. Even my girls aren\u2019t around fulltime anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking of opening up the daycare for non-employees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust family. You, naturally, for as long as Landon needs it. I know India has been dropping Hudson off occasionally and taking Ellison with her to the shop. Ginger needs to go back to work soon, but she doesn\u2019t want to put the burden of caring for twins on Kade and Kane\u2019s mother Kimi, although Kimi has volunteered.\u201d Skylar smiled. \u201cGrama Kimi loves her grandbabies. She\u2019d happily take all three of our girls and all three of Kane and Ginger\u2019s kids every day.\u201d</p><p>Kimi McKay was the mother-in-law Jessie wished she\u2019d had. Vivacious, caring, fun, fiercely protective of her family, yet the blonde spitfire didn\u2019t take any crap from either of her twin sons or her husband or the rest of the McKay clan.</p><p>\u201cGinger and I talked last night at Keely\u2019s wedding reception, she weighed her options, and I sort of volunteered the daycare at Sky Blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did, she\u2019s your family. And it\u2019s your business Sky, you can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. I just don\u2019t want to take advantage of the situation, or you, especially now that Landon will be part of the mix.\u201d</p><p>Jessie was quiet for a minute or so while she considered the options. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019d be easiest for everyone if we could arrange it so the twins and Landon weren\u2019t there the same days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGinger plans to work four days a week. Have you given any thought to what Landon\u2019s schedule will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt and I discussed having Landon come on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s okay if I tell Ginger Tuesdays and Thursdays work best? The babies won\u2019t start coming for another two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Thanks, Sky, you have no idea how much...\u201d Don\u2019t cry because once you start you won\u2019t be able to stop. Jessie sipped her tea and tried to swallow the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now that we\u2019re done with the business portion of this conversation, Jess, tell me how you\u2019re really doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d A mess. \u201cHandling it. Yes, I\u2019m in shock. Yes, I\u2019m pissed off. Really pissed off at Luke on so many levels I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even discovered them all yet. And this probably will sound horrible, but right after Brandt told me about this kid, I wanted to hate him. Before I ever laid eyes on him. I thought I could look at him and not feel a goddamned thing.</p><p>\u201cBut when I saw him? I didn\u2019t see a dead ringer for Luke, or a kid who should\u2019ve been my son. I saw a lost little boy. A kid who wouldn\u2019t have anyone to see to his basic needs if not for Brandt stepping up to the plate. But Brandt is smart enough to admit he can\u2019t do it alone. He\u2019s also smart enough to know that if he left Landon\u2019s future in his father\u2019s hands, Casper would take legal action to ensure the boy\u2019s mother never saw her son again. Landon doesn\u2019t need that. None of us needs that. What Landon needs is the stability Brandt and I can provide until his mother cleans up her act.\u201d</p><p>When Jessie looked up because Skylar hadn\u2019t made a peep, her gut constricted at the tears rolling down Sky\u2019s face.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t do this.\u201d Skylar swept her fingertips under her eyes. \u201cAnd I agree with Kade. I was tempted to track Brandt down, grab a two by four and beat him over the head for acting so much like his father.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut between your call and you showing up here, I\u2019ve had time to rethink my original response, and Brandt\u2019s head is safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve come to the same conclusion everyone else will?\u201d she asked tightly. \u201cThat I\u2019m a spineless twit?\u201d</p><p>Skylar\u2019s eyes filled with shock. \u201cGod no. I think you\u2019re closer to a saint.\u201d</p><p>Jessie scowled. \u201cI\u2019m far from that, Sky, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I understand why Brandt asked you. Not because you\u2019re spineless. Not because you\u2019re a sucker. But because you\u2019ve got the biggest heart of anyone I know,\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was highly unnerved with the conversation. It was disconcerting to be praised for something she hadn\u2019t yet done, when she knew it\u2019d be a miracle if she made it through the next four hours, let alone the next four months.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that I\u2019ve made you uncomfortable, let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d Ice rattled as Skylar fiddled with her tea glass. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stick around for the bouquet toss last night at Keely\u2019s wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been awkward since it was Luke\u2019s family\u2019s event. Plus, I\u2019m not eager to get married again. Especially not after being blindsided with proof of my husband\u2019s infidelity.\u201d And she\u2019d been doing so well keeping a lid on the whining. \u201cWho caught the bouquet? Ramona West? I think she might\u2019ve actually brought a catcher\u2019s mitt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. Some family friend from down by Casper\u2019s section of the ranch. She seemed to know Dalton.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen her before. Sorry, but I don\u2019t remember her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Jessie stood. \u201cI should be going. I appreciate you taking time out of your day off to talk to me, Sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, anytime. Kade meant it too. Anything you need, just ask us. Not because I\u2019m your boss but because you\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>Now that Brandt was waiting on his brothers to show up, he\u2019d begun to have doubts. Maybe Tell and Dalton wouldn\u2019t want to help out with Landon. God knew they were scarce as soon as the workday ended and they spent most Monday mornings sharing the down and dirty details of their wild weekends.</p><p>You ain\u2019t exactly a saint. You\u2019ve ripped it up plenty. Especially in the last ten months.</p><p>Landon\u2019s face turned red, he grunted and the odor chased the air from Brandt\u2019s living room. Sighing, Brandt grabbed a diaper and had just finished changing Landon when his brothers burst in.</p><p>Tell and Dalton stopped inside the door, noses wrinkled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019ve been eatin\u2019, bro, but it\u2019s nasty...\u201d Dalton\u2019s voice trailed away when Landon scampered off the couch.</p><p>Before the little devil could make a break for the open door, Brandt snatched the back of his overalls.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, not so fast there, partner.\u201d To Tell, he said, \u201cWould you please shut the damn door?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. Sure.\u201d Once the latch clicked, Brandt released Landon.</p><p>But the boy stopped, apparently scared by the two bigger men. Tell and Dalton topped Brandt\u2019s five feet ten by a good four inches, and while he\u2019d hated being the shortest of his brothers, he\u2019d never considered their height imposing. But then again everything probably seemed enormous when you were only two feet tall.</p><p>They stared at one another in silence, but Dalton or Tell were focused solely on Landon.</p><p>Dalton cleared his throat. \u201cUh, Brandt, you wanna tell us what\u2019s goin\u2019 on? Why you\u2019ve got a kid here that looks exactly like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d Tell finished.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was gonna say like a mini-version of Brandt.\u201d</p><p>Tell strode over and crouched in front of Landon. \u201cHey, buddy. You don\u2019t gotta be scared.\u201d</p><p>Landon blinked those McKay blue eyes at Tell and shrank against Brandt\u2019s leg.</p> <p>Brandt rubbed his hand over Landon\u2019s head. \u201cThis is Landon. He\u2019s Luke\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor sure?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Did the paternity test and everything.\u201d</p><p>Dalton whistled. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known about him?\u201d This from Tell.</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>Both sets of his brothers\u2019 eyes zoomed to him.</p><p>\u201cLook. Samantha, Landon\u2019s mother, contacted me. Fed me this story about her and Luke...which turned out to be completely true. But I didn\u2019t believe her, not at first, which is why I insisted on a paternity test before I told you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You\u2019ve worked with us every goddamn day for a freakin\u2019 month and you couldn\u2019t let us know this was goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>Brandt held Dalton\u2019s angry gaze. \u201cNo. First of all, it\u2019s been a rough month anyway, with Dad bein\u2019 a first class jackass about how bad we\u2014I\u2014fucked up by lettin\u2019 the north pasture stay fallow this year. I didn\u2019t want to get anyone\u2019s hopes up about Landon in case it was bullshit. Second, because Samantha asked me not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she gets a say in nothin\u2019 since she\u2019s kept Luke\u2019s kid a secret from us,\u201d Dalton shot back.</p><p>\u201cChill out, Dalton,\u201d Tell said. He pinned Brandt with a hard look. \u201cStart from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>By the time he\u2019d finished, Dalton had plopped in the easy chair and Tell had coaxed Landon into sitting on the floor with him.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mom and Dad are gonna shit bricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think? That\u2019s why I need you guys to go over there with me when we break the news about their first grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell no. I ain\u2019t gonna pretend I knew anything about this. You know how dad is, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly my point. We\u2019ve gotta show him we\u2019re united on this, on doin\u2019 what\u2019s best for Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the fact Luke is dead, if this Samantha chick is goin\u2019 to jail, then Dad will wanna sue for permanent guardianship,\u201d Tell pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow that to happen. Before you argue that turnin\u2019 Landon over to Mom and Dad is the best option, I\u2019ll remind you this is a temporary situation. And if we show Samantha we want Landon to be part of our lives, without the threat of takin\u2019 him away from her, the better it\u2019ll be for everybody in the long run.\u201d Brandt glanced down at Landon, surprised the rambunctious kid was sitting still.</p><p>\u201cYou so sure Samantha will want her kid back when she gets outta jail?\u201d</p><p>No. Brandt wasn\u2019t surprised his brothers had voiced the same question Jessie had. \u201cI\u2019ve got no choice but to believe it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton and Tell traded a skeptical look before Tell spoke. \u201cFine. We\u2019re with you on this. But how in the hell do you plan to baby-sit this kid for the next four months? We\u2019ve got a ranch to run. I\u2019ll remind you the workload has increased since Luke died and Dad ain\u2019t doin\u2019 diddly anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be really shitty if you expect Mom to watch Landon all the time and then in four months just snatch him away from her like he didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Dalton added.</p><p>That option wasn\u2019t any better for Jessie, either. \u201cI know. Which is why I\u2019m gonna suggest Mom watches him one weekday, and then the three of us could rotate and take over on the other weekday and I\u2019d have him on weekends.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cAnd what about the three other days during the workweek?\u201d</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cJessie has agreed to take Landon to Sky Blue daycare those three days,\u201d and braced himself for their reaction.</p><p>\u201cJessie knows about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her last night after the wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>Dalton launched himself out of the chair. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be fuckin\u2019 kiddin\u2019 me! You not only blabbed to Jessie about Luke\u2019s bastard child, you asked her to help you take care of him?\u201d He stomped closer and loomed over his older brother. \u201cIs this your way of makin\u2019 sure she hates you so you can stay the hell away from her for good?\u201d</p><p>Tell didn\u2019t jump to Brandt\u2019s defense either. \u201cI\u2019m with Dalton on this. It\u2019s goddamn selfish of you to expect anything from Jessie except a knee to the balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then how come Jessie agreed to help out?\u201d Brandt demanded. \u201cIf I\u2019m such a flaming fucking asshole who doesn\u2019t give a good goddamn about how she feels then why did she call Skylar and explain the situation? Why did she agree with me that it\u2019d be better if I stayed overnight with her during the week instead of us dragging Landon back and forth between our places? Why did she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Dalton bellowed. \u201cWas she drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Tell said, \u201cGuys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why we wanted you to stay away from Jessie, Brandt. You two keep hurting each other over and over and neither of you even realizes you\u2019re doin\u2019 it! Goddammit, do you know what it\u2019s like for us to have to watch you both miserable\u2014\u201d</p><p>Landon started to wail, scared by the raised voices. Before Brandt could pick him up, Tell pulled the boy onto his lap. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. We\u2019re just a little freaked out by you and this whole situation. But we\u2019re gonna do everything we can to make sure your needs are met above anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>No surprise Tell looked right at Brandt when he said the last part.</p><p>Tell said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve got some warped version of happily ever after floating in your head, bro, but even if you and Jessie do spend all this time together in close quarters taking care of Luke\u2019s kid, you do know she ain\u2019t gonna fall in love with you, right?\u201d</p><p>Hurt, resentment, denial swelled up inside Brandt to the point he thought he might explode. But he tamped it down; refusing to lash out at Tell or give into the hair trigger temper he\u2019d inherited from their father.</p><p>\u201cMore likely than not, when it\u2019s all over, she\u2019ll hate your guts for forcing her hand.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Jessie hating him had bile crawling up Brandt\u2019s throat.</p><p>Dalton added, \u201cHate to agree with Tell, but I don\u2019t see it endin\u2019 up any other way, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Tell, the peacemaker, said, \u201cWhat was up with Uncle Carson givin\u2019 Keely and Jack some land as a wedding gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink Dad knew about it?\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cProbably. Typical that he didn\u2019t tell us. But it doesn\u2019t fit that he ain\u2019t throwing a shit fit about it. He\u2019s always insisted the McKay land trust won\u2019t allow for pieces just to be handed out. Not even to the next generation. It has to be a unanimous decision.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, if I thought we could get part of our land parceled out to us and away from Dad\u2019s control...\u201d</p><p>Brandt snorted. \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen.

There\u2019ll be hell to pay if he hears about it from someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Brandt swung Landon into his arms. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>The meeting with his parents went about like Brandt expected. Rage on his father\u2019s part, mostly directed at the woman who\u2019d dared to keep Luke\u2019s child a secret from his family. His mother cried a lot while she carted Landon around, enticing him to eat, then chasing him through the house. She looked happier than he\u2019d seen her in years.</p><p>When Brandt relayed Landon\u2019s childcare arrangements during the months he\u2019d have guardianship, his father accused Jessie of trying to keep the boy from his real family out of spite. That was the last straw for the visit. Brandt pried Landon out of his mother\u2019s arms amidst his father\u2019s threats for legal action.</p><p>Dalton and Tell were quiet on the way back to Brandt\u2019s place. They kept the boy entertained while Brandt loaded up Landon\u2019s things and double-checked everything since he\u2019d be gone for five days. After they agreed to meet at Dalton\u2019s house to figure out the week\u2019s work, Brandt made the forty-five minute drive to Jessie\u2019s.</p> <p>Something stirred in him when he saw Jessie sitting on the front steps with Lexie by her side. The afternoon had warmed up from the bouts of snow flurries earlier in the day and the wind blew random strands of her reddish blonde hair across her appled cheeks. She looked young, fresh and wholesome.</p><p>Which made him feel guilty as sin for the direction of his impure thoughts.</p><p>Landon kicked his feet to be let out of his seat. Brandt set him on the ground and the kid took off toward Lexie with a squeal of delight. When the dog cowered beneath the deck, Brandt plucked a plastic ball from one of the bins of toys in the back of his truck and tossed it into the yard. Landon held the ball, dropped it, threw it, moving as fast as his legs could carry him.</p><p>\u201cLooks like he\u2019s got some pent-up energy,\u201d Jessie remarked.</p><p>\u201cI figure it\u2019ll be good for him to run around, get some fresh air, maybe he\u2019ll sleep better tonight, bein\u2019s he\u2019s in a strange place.\u201d</p><p>She scooted over, making room for him to sit beside her.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go with Skylar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one hundred percent on board with it. Probably more so than I am.\u201d</p> <p>Brandt said nothing.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just... God, it\u2019s really freakin\u2019 weird, okay? I\u2019m sitting here watching Luke\u2019s kid run around, and I had such a close connection to Luke, but I also feel like I didn\u2019t know him at all. I look at the kid and I don\u2019t know what I feel. It didn\u2019t help Skylar started saying all these things about how I should be nominated for sainthood for opening my heart and home to Landon, and I couldn\u2019t take it. I had to leave.</p><p>And then, your mom called about a half hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she was sorry about how everything played out after Luke died, but she had no say in the matter since she had nothing to do with the McKay Ranch.\u201d Jessie turned her head to look at him; Brandt had no choice but to meet her gaze. \u201cJoan cried, Brandt. She broke down and basically said she can\u2019t imagine how hard this is for me, but at the same time she feels like she\u2019s been given a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. \u201cIf she said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s it. She said she wouldn\u2019t fight her husband when it came to ranch matters, but when it came to matters involving her sons, she\u2019d fight that mean bastard tooth and nail.\u201d</p><p>Brandt knew neither he nor his brothers would\u2019ve grown up to be half the men they were if not for their mother. She gave them the love and affection their father wouldn\u2019t, even if she had to hide that affection from her husband. \u201cMom said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Said she\u2019d do anything to help out, including taking Landon another day of the week to save you boys the hassle. She volunteered to drive here. Told me she\u2019d lie to Casper if she had to, but she doubted he\u2019d notice she was gone unless it was mealtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reminded her the decision wasn\u2019t up to me, that you\u2019re Landon\u2019s guardian, but we\u2019d talk about it and you\u2019d call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a good idea, my mom takin\u2019 care of Landon two days?\u201d</p><p>Jessie sighed. \u201cYes, it\u2019d be good for both of them. Besides, I\u2019ve never had a problem with Joan. We weren\u2019t best buddies, but I chalked it up to the fact she doesn\u2019t have many female friends. Or your dad didn\u2019t want us to be friends.\u201d</p><p>Lexie had inched her way to the edge of the yard and seemed fascinated by Landon and his ball.</p><p>\u201cI never understood why my dad was so mean to you, Jess. Well, besides the fact he\u2019s an asshole and he pretty much acts like that toward everyone.\u201d</p><p>She managed a wan smile. \u201cProbably because Luke felt trapped and I\u2019m the evil sorceress responsible for that entrapment. One time Luke told me Casper said...\u201d Her mouth snapped shut. \u201cShit. Sorry. Never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt serves no purpose, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently Casper suggested I\u2019d faked the pregnancy because I knew Luke would never marry someone like me without being forced into it.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s jaw tightened and he barely gritted out, \u201cLuke just said this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d had a fight and he\u2019d been drinking and he said a buncha stuff that was just downright nasty.</p><p>The next morning he\u2019d realized what he\u2019d done, he hated himself for acting like his dad, and he apologized over and over. But it wasn\u2019t like he could take any of it back. It wasn\u2019t like he could pretend he\u2019d just made it up, because we both knew it was true.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word. He couldn\u2019t speak around the ball of rage clogging his throat.</p><p>Finally, Jessie put her hand on his arm. \u201cBrandt? You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s...I hate that I don\u2019t realize what an assholish thing I\u2019ve done until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Like am I acting just like my dad? Forcing you into doing things my way and following my plan regarding Landon because I know your weak spots and know just how to exploit them?</p><p>Before he could give her a less honest, less painful answer, Landon face-planted and commenced to wailing. Brandt was off the steps in an instant, but he didn\u2019t beat Jessie to Landon\u2019s side.</p><p>She cocked the boy on her hip and murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d and brushed the dried grass from his hair.</p><p>Landon stared at Jessie and then squirmed toward Brandt.</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019s hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Come to think of it, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Uncle Brandt is always hungry so I know you won\u2019t starve when he\u2019s taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>Brandt grinned. \u201cAs long as the kid likes meat, potatoes and veggies, we\u2019ll get along fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No super spicy chicken wings? No cheesy nachos with jalapenos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I gave most of that kinda stuff up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever you\u2019ve been eating, keep it up. If I haven\u2019t mentioned it, you look great.\u201d Jessie headed for her house, leaving Brandt staring after her, dumbfounded.</p><p>A compliment? From Jessie? Out of the freakin\u2019 blue?</p><p>What did she want?</p><p>Not everything is a power play. Maybe she was just being nice.</p><p>While Brandt unloaded the truck and set up the crib in the spare bedroom, Jessie cooked hamburgers and macaroni and cheese. Landon ate a pile of food and almost fell asleep in his high chair. Brandt probably would\u2019ve just put the kid in his jammies and tucked him in bed, but Jessie suggested a bath.</p><p>Turned out Landon was a kid who didn\u2019t enjoy baths. It was like wrestling a wet worm\u2014an angry, screaming wet worm. Once he had Landon cleaned up, dried off, freshly diapered and wearing pajamas, Brandt was ready to nod off. But he prepared Landon\u2019s bedtime bottle and settled in the recliner.</p><p>Landon made short work of the bottle and was out. Brandt placed him on his back in his crib, tucking the covers around the sleeping boy.</p><p>Jessie glanced up from the kitchen table when he returned to the living room. \u201cIs he down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be that easy. Quinn is always complaining about how hard it is to get Adam to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2019s a little older and it is harder when a kid is past the \u2018bottle before bed\u2019 age.\u201d</p><p>He sank into the couch. \u201cThat\u2019s the second time you\u2019ve mentioned the bottle thing. Like Landon\u2019s somehow...too old to have a bottle.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the pen to the table and rubbed the skin between her eyes. \u201cI was just sharing my experience\u2014my limited experience. It\u2019s up to his mother to decide when to wean him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t think getting him off the bottle is something I oughta tackle while I\u2019m takin\u2019 care of him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod no.\u201d Then Jessie didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t relish spending the next four months waiting for Jessie to converse with him. He snagged the remote and turned the TV on, keeping the sound low, happy that Jessie still had satellite.</p><p>After catching up on the latest football games, he hunkered down to watch a western.</p> <p>As soon as Jessie finished whatever she\u2019d been doing at the table, she joined him on the couch. Might make him selfish, but Brandt wouldn\u2019t mind if this was how the nights for the next four months played out.</p><p>Once the movie ended, Jessie stood. \u201cYou need anything before I turn in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He pointed at the baby monitor. \u201cI\u2019ve got it handled if Landon wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow early are you heading to the ranch tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured I\u2019d leave around six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get up at five thirty to feed the animals, so that oughta work out. Since it only takes fifteen minutes to get to Sky Blue, I don\u2019t leave until six forty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019d be easier, havin\u2019 me stay until then\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jessie got a strange look on her face. \u201cDon\u2019t trust me alone with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake, Jess, what the hell is that supposed to mean? Of course I trust you with him or I wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve asked for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d</p><p>Say something.</p> <p>\u201cGoodnight, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out on the couch and flipped through channels. Fighting a wave of sleepiness, he pulled his ball cap down over his forehead. He\u2019d just rest his eyes for a minute.</p><p>Soft cries roused him. Groggy, he pushed up from the couch and fiddled with the volume on the baby monitor and heard the noise again.</p><p>Not Landon. Jessie.</p><p>Brandt tiptoed down the hallway to Jessie\u2019s bedroom. Her door was open and he listened just outside the jamb. Sure enough, another soft sob echoed. Without thinking, Brandt entered her room.</p><p>She\u2019d curled into a ball in the middle of her bed, resting her forehead to her knees. Her shoulders shook with each sob.</p><p>His heart fell straight to his toes. \u201cJessie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me do what? Fall apart even more?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the snarled hair shadowing her face.</p><p>Jessie slowly raised her head, burning him with a look of pure venom. \u201cI hate you for doing this to me.\u201d</p><p>His breath stalled.</p><p>\u201cAnd when Landon is back with his mother? I never want to see your face again. Now get the hell out of my room.\u201d</p><p>Suffocation and dizziness set in. Jessie\u2019s image wavered and everything went black.</p><p>Brandt sat straight up, gasping for air. It took him a second to get his bearings. He was at Jessie\u2019s house. Not slumped in her doorway but sprawled on the couch, TV droning in the background. Squinting at the clock, he realized only a half hour had passed since he\u2019d closed his eyes.</p><p>Except it hadn\u2019t felt like a bad dream; it felt more like a premonition.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Jessie wished she\u2019d taken Brandt up on his offer to come to Sky Blue and help with Landon on his first day because the kid was a holy terror.</p><p>The other kids scared him, so he cried and screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>The other adults scared him, so he cried and screamed, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>At first Landon didn\u2019t want anything to do with Jessie. Then he refused to let go of her leg. He clung to her, crying like his heart was breaking.</p><p>I know how you feel, kid.</p><p>Lunchtime was a disaster. She\u2019d buckled Landon in the high chair while she readied the other kids\u2019</p><p>lunches. He beat his hands on the tray, arched his back, and tried to throw himself out of the chair, all while screaming.</p><p>Spitting mad, his face was bright red and covered in a mix of tears, drool and snot. She wiped him up and let him out of the chair. The poor little boy didn\u2019t know whether to run off or stick by her. When she walked to the refrigerator, he followed. She took a bottle from the top shelf and held it out to him. Landon snatched it out of her hands, like a wild animal afraid his meal would be stolen, and scampered off.</p><p>She glanced at the clock. Only five hours to go. Yay.</p><p>He calmed down for about ten minutes while he cowered in the corner, watching with those big blue McKay eyes. When Jessie approached him and tried to take away his empty bottle, he returned to shrieking. And he added hitting, just to make things interesting.</p><p>For about three seconds Jessie considered setting him in a playpen and leaving him in one of the empty offices upstairs until he screamed himself to sleep.</p><p>Buck up and deal with it.</p><p>She crouched down in front of him. \u201cNo hitting, Landon. Ever. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>He swatted at her and she grabbed his wrist. \u201cNo hitting.\u201d</p><p>He wailed.</p><p>Since none of the other kids could nap through his screaming, Jessie let them take their blankets and pillows and watch a movie in the separate play room.</p><p>The main door to the daycare opened and Skylar walked in, cringing at Landon\u2019s ear piercing shrieks.</p><p>She motioned Jessie aside.</p><p>Jessie blurted, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if he\u2019s disturbing you, but I\u2019ve tried everything and nothing is working.\u201d</p><p>Skylar placed her hand on Jessie\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming you. It\u2019ll probably take a couple of days for him to get used to this place and the other kids, so I\u2019m going to suggest we ease him into it. A few hours at a time this week, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jessie knew that was the smart thing to do, but she still felt like she\u2019d failed with him. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso, I know you\u2019d intended to take Landon over to Joan\u2019s tomorrow, but it\u2019d be better if he got used to coming here all week. Take him to Joan\u2019s or whatever at night, but he needs to get acclimated here first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019ll call Brandt and have him pick Landon up right away, but it\u2019ll probably be at least an hour before he can get here from the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, Jess, but you should take Landon back to your place now. Have Brandt meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Sky shot the still screaming kid a quick glance. \u201cWith a six pack and a bottle of aspirin.\u201d</p><p>Jessie managed a smile. \u201cThanks. Who\u2019s filling in for me for the rest of today?\u201d</p><p>Two raps sounded on the glass part of the door and Kade sauntered in, wearing his usual workday clothes; jeans, boots, hat and flannel shirt.</p><p>Immediately Landon stopped wailing.</p><p>Jessie and Sky exchanged a what the hell? look and then looked at Kade.</p><p>Kade shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the hat.\u201d He crouched down, facing Landon, far enough away not to scare him. \u201cYou sure got a set of lungs on ya. And I thought Miz Eliza was loud.\u201d</p><p>Landon raced to Kade and threw himself at the cowboy with a sob.</p><p>Logically, Jessie knew Landon went to Kade because he reminded him of Brandt. But emotionally, it made her feel like she was lacking a maternal instinct.</p><p>You\u2019re not the boy\u2019s mother. You shouldn\u2019t have that instinct.</p><p>The last thing she needed was more self-doubt. She backed away to get their belongings and to call Brandt.</p><p>Kade was such a good guy he put on Landon\u2019s coat. Then he carried Landon to her truck and buckled him in his car seat. Jessie braced herself for the frustrated cries to start again, but Landon was silent. He\u2019d fallen asleep.</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>So Jessie drove. Past her house and into Moorcroft. She killed almost an hour, reluctant to rouse Landon. While she drove, she compiled a list of reasons why this wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>Her stepfather\u2019s mantra echoed in her mind\u2014 winners never quit and quitters never win.</p><p>But this was different. This was a losing situation all around.</p><p>She saw Brandt climbing out of his truck when she pulled into her driveway. She motioned him over and rolled down the window.</p><p>He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in. Fast. Landon\u2019s asleep and I don\u2019t wanna wake the little beast up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Brandt climbed in the passenger side. \u201cLook, Jess, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cI just want to enjoy the silence for a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and relaxed in the seat.</p><p>But Jessie could feel him looking at her. And for the first time, maybe ever, she didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>After about ten minutes, Brandt asked, \u201cWhat happened today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon melted down. Completely. Skylar has suggested I only take him to daycare in the morning until he gets used to it. She even suggested we skip taking him to your mom this week until he\u2019s more settled.\u201d Her hands tightened on the wheel. \u201cI\u2019m gonna let you handle that with Joan. And I want you to make sure she knows I\u2019m not trying to keep Landon away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Jess, I\u2019d never do that to you.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to say \u201cI\u2019m not like Luke\u201d but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Brandt stretched his arm along the back of the seat. \u201cSo if Landon\u2019s only gonna be there part time this week, where do I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pick him up at noon, because I can\u2019t afford to take every afternoon off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019ll let Tell and Dalton know it\u2019ll be a short work week for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Casper won\u2019t chew your ass for not being around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. But nothin\u2019 I ever do makes him happy anyway, so he\u2019ll just pile on more shit work for when I am there. Threatening to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreatening to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame old tune, him reminding\u2019 me I gotta \u2018prove\u2019 to him that I\u2019m dedicated enough to take over the ranch. He\u2019s been hangin\u2019 that over my head since Luke died.\u201d</p><p>If that irked her, Jessie couldn\u2019t imagine how Brandt felt. \u201cWould Casper really do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Cut me out of ownership of our part of the ranch? If he decided he had a good enough reason, absolutely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence filled the cab\u2014not comfortable silence.</p><p>Brandt gently said, \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this, Brandt.\u201d</p> <p>He paused a second. \u201cOkay. I appreciate your honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if a few hours is enough to make a decision. Especially if all you\u2019ve had with him are a few bad hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you to decide to ask me to help you with Landon\u2019s care?\u201d</p><p>He mumbled something.</p> <p>\u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days. Three very long days when I second and third guessed this from every possible angle and...I still ain\u2019t sure I did the right thing.\u201d</p><p>That admission surprised her.</p><p>\u201cEvery one of my McKay cousins showed up this morning and that\u2019s a rare thing, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Jessie frowned. \u201cWhy? Is there something going on with the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something goin\u2019 on, but I usually hear about it long after it\u2019s happened. Dad ain\u2019t real good about keepin\u2019 me informed, which pisses me off because I\u2019ve been doin\u2019 every damn thing he\u2019s ever asked and he still has all the control and never lets me forget it.\u201d He inhaled. Exhaled. \u201cSorry. That\u2019s twice I\u2019ve gone off about it today. For once my cousins showing up didn\u2019t have nothin\u2019 to do with the ranch.</p> <p>They came because of Landon. But mostly because of you.\u201d</p><p>Her gut clenched. \u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked why I didn\u2019t come to them first and ask for help.\u201d</p><p>No surprise the McKay\u2019s circled the wagons around one of their own. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>Brandt sighed, pushing his hat back to rub his forehead. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say. It pissed me off a little, to be honest. Because of the...family dynamic between my dad and his brothers, it\u2019d make things ten times worse for everyone if I\u2019d asked one of Uncle Carson\u2019s, or Uncle Cal\u2019s, or Uncle Charlie\u2019s sons or daughters-in-law to help.\u201d</p><p>She weighed aspects of this situation she hadn\u2019t considered. \u201cIs it a family pride thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a nosy question. Maybe for the first time I understand why you involved me\u2014because I\u2019m neutral. The lesser of two evils. You knew your dad would prefer to have me, who he\u2019s never liked, helping out with Landon, rather than taking his brothers\u2019 or his nephews\u2019 charity.\u201d Another thing occurred to her.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your McKay relatives knowing you don\u2019t think your father would be a fit guardian for Landon, even temporarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s more about how they view my mom and not my dad.\u201d</p><p>Logical, sweet Brandt. Sparing his mother\u2019s feelings. Figuring out every contingency before he made a single move. It used to drive Luke crazy, since Luke was the impulsive one.</p><p>And look what happened to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re just a good guy who\u2019s been put in a no win situation and you\u2019re trying to make everyone happy.\u201d Jessie had circled back to her house. She braked and turned into her driveway.</p><p>Brandt said nothing until after she\u2019d parked. Then he faced her with such a look of misery her breath caught. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about me, Jessie. I\u2019m not a good guy. I\u2019m selfish. You were always my first choice.</p><p>Always. Even when I knew this would hurt you like nothin\u2019 else, I still went ahead and demanded this of you anyway. And I have to live with knowing when this is done, you\u2019ll probably hate me and I\u2019ll deserve it.\u201d</p><p>He jumped out and hefted a still sleeping Landon into his arms before she could formulate a response.</p><p>Three hours later, Jessie couldn\u2019t believe the change in Landon. He played quietly with his toys on the floor, although he never ventured very far from Brandt. Happy as she was that he wasn\u2019t screaming, she worried his adjustment at the daycare would take longer if was subjected to continual quiet instead of chaos. After she popped the casserole in the oven, she returned to the living room where Brandt was working on his laptop.</p><p>He glanced up and smiled.</p><p>Mercy. That smile of his could knock her for a loop.</p><p>Since when? Her practical side demanded.</p><p>Since always, her feminine side countered.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, that roguish smile died. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. You just look so studious. I\u2019m not used to it.\u201d</p><p>Landon pushed to his feet and ran to Brandt, possessively wrapping his arm around Brandt\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Jessie shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s really afraid I\u2019m gonna take him away from you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get used to you. I\u2019m just the only familiar thing in his world right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times did you see him before his mother went to jail?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and continued looking at Landon. \u201cI stopped by about twice a week. Sometimes Samantha needed a break from bein\u2019 a single parent and I\u2019d take him off her hands for a couple of hours.</p><p>Other times she just needed someone to talk to. Either way, I ended up hangin\u2019 out with him.\u201d</p><p>An unfamiliar, sharp pang arose. For the first time Jessie wondered if Brandt might\u2019ve developed feelings for Landon\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cJessie. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doin\u2019 anything wrong with him. Give him more than a day to get used to you.\u201d</p><p>She was relieved Brandt hadn\u2019t picked up on the real reason for her worry. Especially since she didn\u2019t understand why it\u2019d caused a spark of jealousy. \u201cI\u2019m going out to feed the horses and the llamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m used to doing everything myself.\u201d</p><p>A guilty look flashed in his eyes. \u201cHow are the llamas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy and Ethel are great. But they\u2019d like male attention. They miss their mates. And their babies.\u201d</p><p>Jessie hated selling her male llamas and Lucy and Ethel\u2019s last babies. But they\u2019d been raised specifically to work cattle and were easily bored and got into trouble if they didn\u2019t have a herd to protect. A bored llama was a dangerous llama. Luckily Lucy and Ethel had half a dozen horses to run with, but they had escaped a few times, probably looking for intimate male companionship.</p><p>You\u2019d like some intimate male companionship too.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with her today?</p><p>\u201cThose baby llamas were awful cute,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cSomeday I\u2019ll have babies, but not now. The timing is all wrong.\u201d</p><p>Brandt frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Jessie slipped on her coveralls, her ratty old Carhartt coat, her leather gloves, and her ridiculous looking, but very warm, Elmer Fudd hat. She tugged on the waterproof work boots, whistled for Lexie and was out the door.</p><p>I\u2019m used to doing everything myself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a shot at him, but Brandt still felt guilty. In the six months before Luke died, he\u2019d passed a lot of his ranch responsibilities to Jessie. Jessie already had her hands full taking care of the horses, Luke expected she\u2019d learn every aspect of being a ranch wife and worked her to the bone.</p><p>Which was why Brandt, Tell and Dalton had become so enraged when his father kicked Jessie out of the home she and Luke shared. After Jessie turned down Brandt\u2019s offer to live in his house, which he owned free and clear, he\u2019d scrambled to find Jessie a place where she could bring her horses and llamas. It pained him to think she\u2019d still had to give up some of them up.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t feel Landon clinging to his leg, he glanced at the boy standing by the door. The kid only cared about the dog, and running free outside as he chased the dog, so maybe fresh air would do him good. \u201cWanna go outside and see the llamas?\u201d</p><p>Landon just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if you could talk. Or at least try to talk.\u201d</p><p>But when Brandt grabbed his coat off the peg, Landon seemed to grasp Brandt\u2019s intention. He didn\u2019t fuss at all when Brandt bundled him up. But his winter wear options were sorely lacking and the kid needed snow boots and snow pants.</p><p>No snow covered the ground today, although it was cold and the wind blew like a bitch. He blocked the worst of the wind from Landon\u2019s face as he carried him to the fence.</p><p>Jessie was in the pasture with the llamas. They were intent on whatever she was talking to them about, until they noticed Brandt and Landon.</p><p>Given the way Landon was scared of everything, it surprised him that the boy reached over the fence to touch the animals. \u201cWhoa, buddy, wait a second. Let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s okay.\u201d Brandt looked at Jessie.</p><p>She said, \u201cAs long as you hold him, it should be all right.\u201d She spoke to the llamas in a lilting tone, and Brandt had a moment of jealousy. What would it be like to have Jessie murmuring to him like that?</p><p>Pure heaven.</p><p>Landon shrieked, \u201cGoggie!\u201d and Lexie bounded away, her doggie body language said, Ha ha, you can\u2019t catch me now, sucker.</p><p>Brandt laughed. For some reason Brandt\u2019s laughter made Landon giggle.</p><p>Jessie grinned. \u201cThis is much better than earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her arm around a llama\u2019s neck and urged her closer. \u201cThis is Lucy. She is far too curious for her own good.\u201d She looked at Landon and held out her hand, palm up.</p><p>He blinked at her and frowned. But he watched her.</p><p>She reached in her pocket and pulled out a chunk of carrot. She opened her palm, put the carrot in the center and held it out to Lucy.</p><p>Lucy sniffed and lowered her head over the carrot, bringing it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSee? You wanna feed Ethel? You\u2019ve gotta do the same thing. Just like this.\u201d She explained the whole process again. Landon held his hand out, exactly the way Jessie instructed.</p><p>Brandt was blown away by her patience, showing Landon every step, speaking to him softly, but not in a baby-talk voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Ethel gobbled the carrot chunk from Landon\u2019s hand, he shrieked with happiness.</p><p>Both he and Jessie winced. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta find a better way for him to communicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019m almost finished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith all the animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just the llamas. See? Here come the horses.\u201d</p><p>The six horses trotted in from the pasture, tossing their manes, as if eating the hay Jessie had spread out was of no consequence. That if they truly wanted something better, they could\u2019ve gotten it themselves.</p><p>Temperamental damn things. He preferred cows. They ate. They bred. They calved. They either went through the cycle again or went away. Simple.</p><p>You used to like horses. You used to want to implement a breeding program.</p> <p>But it\u2019d become just another thing Casper McKay had ridiculed and Brandt let that idea go.</p><p>Landon squirmed to be let down. Brandt crouched beside him next to the fence and gave him a play by play of what Jessie was doing. The kid actually seemed to be listening.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s because someone is taking the time to talk to him.</p><p>Samantha hadn\u2019t been forthcoming about her parenting skills, probably because they were lacking.</p><p>As Brandt was about to hoist Landon onto his hip, the gate opened and Lexie tore out. Landon gave chase before Brandt could grab onto his hood and stop him. Damn. The kid was fast.</p><p>\u201cHey, wait a second. Come back here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet him run.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known the instant Jessie came up behind him, even before she spoke. It might\u2019ve been the scent of her cherry Chapstick carried on the wind. Or it might\u2019ve been the sound her coveralls made as she walked closer. A sound he\u2019d heard a lot in the year they spent together doing chores. He faced her. \u201cNeed me to do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Unless you wanna stay out here and watch Landon run his legs off while I shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI can wash my own back, but thanks for offering.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d been thinking at all. But now that she\u2019d brought it up, Brandt couldn\u2019t get the image of her wet, nekkid body out of his mind. Watching the water sluice over her curves through a cloud of steam surrounding her. Steam that hung heavy and damp with the sweet scent of her soap. Or with the musky aroma from her...</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He looked toward Landon to hide his blush. \u201cThe offer stands. Any time. However, I was thinkin\u2019 along the lines of the longer I keep him out here, the earlier he\u2019ll hit the hay tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood plan. Come in whenever you guys are ready.\u201d</p><p>Brandt commended his willpower in not turning around and watching her hips sway as she headed to the house.</p><p>Snap out of it, man. This is the first day. If she catches you eyeballing her ass, she\u2019ll kick yours right out the door.</p><p>True. But that pesky feeling of hope arose, that feeling he\u2019d all but stomped out when she\u2019d shot him down last year. Given months to reflect, he understood how lousy his timing had been.</p><p>Landon started to fall asleep during supper. While Brandt bathed him, Jessie washed the dishes. She\u2019d changed into sweat pants after her shower, and when he returned to the living room after putting Landon down for the night, he had to stop and grip the back of the reclining chair.</p><p>How many nights had they spent just like this? Jessie sitting cross-legged on the couch, engrossed in her knitting. Him watching TV, or pretending to watch TV when it was far more interesting to covertly watch her.</p><p>They\u2019d spent dozens of nights together. Revisiting those nights gave him the same sharp ache of want he\u2019d felt back then.</p><p>Jessie looked up. Her gaze flicked over him and she smiled. \u201cNice jammies.\u201d</p><p>Brandt glanced down at the camo fleece pants and camo tank top. Okay, maybe they didn\u2019t match, but they didn\u2019t look that bad. \u201cHey, at least I\u2019m wearin\u2019 jammies. Normally I sleep commando.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be a family thing. Luke did too.\u201d</p><p>A perfectly natural comment, but for some reason it rubbed him wrong. He plopped right beside her.</p><p>He leaned over and peered at the twisted ball of yarn on her lap. \u201cWhatcha makin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She held up a brown blob. \u201cA mess. It\u2019s supposed to be a hat for my mom\u2019s husband for Christmas. It sort of looks like a cowpie right now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But it don\u2019t smell like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet.\u201d</p><p>Brandt held his breath, expecting her to say something about Luke being sweet, too, but she just sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna watch X-Files reruns? This is pointless tonight.\u201d She set aside her knitting. \u201cI\u2019m too wound up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a rough morning. Think tomorrow will be easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. I don\u2019t know if I can stand being the kid\u2019s last choice for the next four months.\u201d She expelled a soft, bitter laugh. \u201cAlthough I should be used to it. Like father like son, right?\u201d</p><p>That crack about Luke didn\u2019t sit any better with Brandt than the first one did.</p><p>Jessie sighed again. \u201cSorry. I should probably haul my cranky self to bed.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand. \u201cStay. Drink a beer with me. We\u2019ll heckle the bizarre plot line and wonder why in the hell Mulder and Scully don\u2019t just get it on already. Jesus. How long can they drag out the sexual tension when it\u2019s obvious the two of them belong together?\u201d</p><p>She faced him and frowned. \u201cIt takes them a while, but they do end up together. We watched the last season, last year, remember?\u201d</p><p>Not really. As usual, he\u2019d been more interested in gawking at Jessie. \u201cI must\u2019ve forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot that Mulder and Scully drove off toward a happy future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s easier to believe in monsters because happily ever after doesn\u2019t happen in real life.\u201d</p><p>Jessie gave him a curious look before she tossed him the remote. \u201cOne episode. Then I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>Landon\u2019s behavior Tuesday at daycare was marginally better than Monday.</p><p>Landon\u2019s behavior Wednesday at daycare was markedly better than Tuesday.</p><p>Landon\u2019s behavior Thursday at daycare was good enough he stayed the entire day.</p><p>Brandt and Jessie had fallen into an easy evening routine\u2014too easy. The three of them fed the animals together. They ate supper together. Brandt bathed Landon and tucked him in bed. Then he and Jessie watched TV together until one of them or both of them fell asleep. If she conked out first, he\u2019d watch her like a fucking perv, but he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her. Something about seeing her so unguarded in sleep reinforced the idea she was vulnerable and strengthened his resolve to protect her at all costs.</p><p>Even if he was the one most dangerous to her.</p><p>So when they were offered a break in the routine, Brandt grabbed it, telling Jessie his mother wanted to have Landon for an hour or so after supper. But first on their to-do list was outfitting Landon for winter weather.</p><p>As far as shopping went, Brandt didn\u2019t mind the farm supply store. Tisdale\u2019s carried everything essential to ranching and he usually ran into someone he knew. It hadn\u2019t occurred to him that might not be a good thing until it happened.</p><p>He and Jessie were in the boot section of Tisdale\u2019s, trying to figure out if rubber boots worn over shoes were a better choice than simple snow boots. Since neither he nor Jessie had shoe shopped for a toddler, getting Landon to sit still proved a major obstacle.</p><p>\u201cNo. Put those back. We don\u2019t want anything with laces.\u201d</p><p>Brandt held up the camouflage boots. \u201cBut they have drawstrings on the top. They\u2019ll stay tied.\u201d</p><p>Landon reached for them with a possessive grunt.</p><p>\u201cSee? He loves them. They\u2019re hip. And manly.\u201d</p><p>Jessie grumbled and let go of Landon for two seconds. The kid was off like an antelope.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Landon, get back here.\u201d Shit. He wasn\u2019t supposed to swear. He snagged the boy by the waist and hung him upside down on the trip back to the boot department. Landon shrieked, the good kind of shrieks, but still, he was awful damn loud.</p><p>\u201cNow sit on Jessie\u2019s lap and be a good boy so we can get this over with, okay?\u201d</p><p>Landon nodded and Brandt grinned. The kid was already getting better at communicating and it\u2019d only been a few days.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>He whirled around and looked into the beady eyes of Margene Hieb. Margene and her husband Larry lived up the road from his folks. They\u2019d been friendly neighbors for years until their oldest daughter, Pandora, became the walking wounded due to Luke\u2019s heartbreaking ways. Consequently, Margene took every opportunity to run her mouth off about anything less than flattering about the McKay family\u2014and there always seemed to be plenty to talk about.</p><p>\u201cMargene.\u201d Brandt peered over Margene\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhere\u2019s Larry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home.\u201d She sidestepped Brandt and stood in front of Jessie. \u201cOh my. It is true. I wasn\u2019t sure, you know how rumors are, never know how they get started.\u201d</p><p>Usually by people like you.</p><p>\u201cHe really looks like his father, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Jessie said not a word.</p><p>Margene sighed. \u201cSuch a shame that Luke won\u2019t be around to watch him grow up. It\u2019s an even bigger shame...\u201d She shook her head at Jessie. \u201cI don\u2019t know how on earth you\u2019re just sitting there, holding him, like he was your own. Granted, he is a cute little boy, and you were married to his father, but I don\u2019t see</p><p>how you can overlook the fact he was born on the wrong side of the sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can overlook that fact, Mom, because Jessie was used to Luke cheating on her, like he cheated on everyone before her.\u201d Pandora, mean, nasty Pandora, tossed her fat head and Brandt thought he might\u2019ve seen a snake or two trying to slither out of her hair. \u201cHonestly, the only thing that surprises me?</p><p>That more of his secret spawn haven\u2019t shown up. The man couldn\u2019t keep his pants zipped to save his life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandt looked back and forth between mother and daughter, mentally trying to slap a lid on his temper before his mouth opened and he said something he\u2019d regret. But it didn\u2019t work. \u201cDid that crack about Luke\u2019s character make you feel better, Pandora? You\u2019re still bitter that Luke dumped you...what?</p><p>Ten years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no time limit on the effects of infidelity, Brandt, as Jessie well knows,\u201d Pandora sneered.</p> <p>\u201cBut there is a time limit on my patience and you\u2019ve reached it. Now get out of here before I tell Pastor Jones you both need a personal sermon on learning and practicing forgiveness.\u201d Brandt looked over his shoulder. \u201cI saw him around here someplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would happily relay everything you just said and then some.\u201d</p><p>Huffing and whispering, they took off.</p><p>Brandt looked at Jessie. He started to say I\u2019m sorry, but she shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first, Brandt, but it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d She pointed to the boots, the pair of snow pants and the University of Wyoming tasseled hat. \u201cWe\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d paid and loaded Landon in his carseat, Jessie said, \u201cI should\u2019ve driven into town because after that fun time, I\u2019m ready to go home. And no offense, but I can\u2019t stomach the thought of riding out to your folks\u2019 house with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But my mom is expecting him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me to Dewey\u2019s. I\u2019ll grab something to eat while I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>He started to reach for her hand, but stopped himself. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it a short visit. But it\u2019ll be at least an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can entertain myself, Brandt. I\u2019ve gotten used to it in the last two years.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled up in front of the Sandstone Building and she bailed out with a mumbled, \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Landon was fairly good at his parents\u2019 place, considering his mother insisted on holding him all the time. And from what Brandt had seen of Landon, he wasn\u2019t the snuggliest kid. Brandt cut the visit short when his dad started in on him about prepping for calving season, which was still several months away.</p><p>Plus, he was anxious to get back to Jessie.</p><p>He texted her: You ready 2 go?</p><p>Her response was fast: Already gone. Walking home.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Panicked, Brandt called her. \u201cJess? What do you mean you\u2019re walkin\u2019 home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay in there another second. So I left. I figured you\u2019d catch up with me.\u201d</p> <p>Do not yell at her. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the Shell station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay put. I mean it. I\u2019ll be there in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>It took him eight minutes to reach her.</p><p>Jessie climbed in his truck without a word. She didn\u2019t turn around to check on Landon, who was asleep. She stared straight ahead. He was so freaked out about her fucking walking when it was fifteen degrees out, that he didn\u2019t say anything for fear of saying the wrong thing.</p><p>They\u2019d gone about three miles in brutal silence, when she said, \u201cStop. I feel sick.\u201d</p><p>He eased the truck to the shoulder and she practically jumped out. He gave her a minute before he cut the headlights and checked on her.</p><p>With no moon, city lights or sodium glow from the interstate, everything was pure black\u2014the sky, the ground, the hillside on the left, the sweeping valley on the right. The cold bit into him with sharp teeth.</p><p>No, the chill in his bones was from something else entirely. Fear.</p><p>Jessie teetered on the edge of the road, arms wrapped herself, nearly lost in that dark void.</p><p>Brandt moved in behind her. Close enough if she needed him, far enough away to offer the illusion of space.</p><p>\u201cGet back in the truck and leave me alone, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same thing that happened in Tisdale\u2019s. Not once, but ten times. I had ten different people, people I barely know, come up to me and tell me how fucking sorry they were for me. Sorry! For me. Like I\u2019m some pathetic excuse of a woman that can\u2019t keep a man or birth a child. They\u2019re sorry that my husband ran around on me. They\u2019re sorry that Landon exists. It was horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess.\u201d He set his hands on her shoulders.</p><p>She flinched and shook off his show of sympathy. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. I\u2019m so mad right now I just want to scream!\u201d</p><p>Brandt could take it if she lashed out at him\u2014physically or verbally. Instead of heeding her warning, he enfolded her in his arms, hugging her against his chest. Just as he suspected, she didn\u2019t fight him at all.</p><p>A minute or so passed and he whispered, \u201cStill wanna do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Scream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one here but us. No one would hear but me and maybe a few mule deer.\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let it out.\u201d</p><p>And she did. She screamed and screamed and it absolutely ripped his heart from his chest. Brandt closed his eyes and listened while she let that anger go. Let the frustration go. The hurt, she\u2019d hang onto.</p><p>He held her until the screams tapered off into sobs. She ended up facing him, her face buried in his neck.</p><p>\u201cOh God, it hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him. I loved him like crazy, so how can I hate him so much now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate the position he put you in, not him.\u201d</p><p>She hiccupped. \u201cThis is so fucked up. Here I am telling you that I loved your brother, but I hate him, and you\u2019re trying to make me feel better about having those conflicting feelings, even when you can\u2019t possibly understand because you loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t hate some of the things Luke did, Jess.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head back and blinked away her tears. \u201cWill this get easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe situation with Landon? I wish I could say yes, but I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t bullshit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonesty is always the best policy in my book.\u201d Brandt smiled and pecked her on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019m here for you. Anything you need.\u201d</p><p>Jessie shivered. \u201cThank you. We\u2019d better get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And after hearing those excellent screams, I\u2019m suddenly in the mood for a horror flick.\u201d</p><p>She actually laughed and shoved him. \u201cFine. But this time you\u2019re making the popcorn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Friday afternoon Brandt came into Sky Blue daycare to pick Landon up for the weekend. They\u2019d already loaded Landon\u2019s paltry amount of stuff in Brandt\u2019s truck before they started their respective workdays, so the kid handoff was all that remained.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>She snagged the last bottle out of the fridge and jammed it in the diaper bag. \u201cNo. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get outta your hair then.\u201d He hefted Landon onto his hip and slung the diaper bag over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d she asked. How was it that Brandt looked masculine even carrying a quilted diaper bag printed with yellow duckies?</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 big. Dalton suggested we test Landon\u2019s rodeo skills on the back of a bull first thing in the morning. Tell thinks Landon is built more like a saddle bronc rider. While I\u2019m leanin\u2019 toward blowin\u2019 off all them rough stock events and teachin\u2019 him bulldoggin\u2019. Naturally the afternoon will be devoted to getting Landon used to his very own dirt bike.\u201d</p><p>Jessie laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Landon would look cute in teeny tiny chaps and a little hat.\u201d She reached down and snapped the bottom button on Landon\u2019s coat. \u201cTell and Dalton are spending the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Chores don\u2019t stop because it\u2019s the weekend. Thought we\u2019d do the minimum tomorrow and take Landon with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like you guys will have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your weekend plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the weather. Might work the horses. I\u2019ll probably just stay home.\u201d Like usual. She used to go out with Keely at least one Saturday night of the month, but after Keely and Jack got engaged, Cowgirls\u2019 Night Out stopped.</p><p>\u201cIf you get bored or need anything, or just wanna hang out with us guys, call me, or just show up, okay?\u201d</p><p>Brandt was so damn sweet. She couldn\u2019t help reaching out and running her hand up his arm to let him know she appreciated his offer. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>How did Brandt respond to her show of affection? By brushing his lips over her cheek. \u201cSee you Sunday night, Jess.\u201d</p><p>About thirty seconds after Brandt exited the main door, Simone barreled into the empty daycare room.</p><p>\u201cOmigod. How did I miss cowboy hottie again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta be quicker.\u201d</p><p>All five feet eleven inches of Simone perched on a mini plastic chair. Long arms and longer legs akimbo, she resembled a praying mantis about to strike. \u201cSo, is cowboy hottie quick on the trigger too?\u201d</p><p>Jessie rolled her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t like she hadn\u2019t been thinking about it.</p><p>Nonstop. In vivid detail.</p><p>\u201cI hate it when you get all quiet and introspective. We need to go out and get you loud and rowdy. Get you riled up, dishing on the slim pickins on men around here.\u201d Simone held up her hand when Jessie started to decline. \u201cNo arguing, no excuse. Because I saw cowboy hottie sneak out with the young\u2019un.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cowboy hottie has a name,\u201d Jessie retorted. She faced the wall, wiping off the letters from the white board.</p><p>\u201cOh. So you\u2019re not denying he\u2019s hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. I\u2019ve got eyes. Brandt is unbelievably hot. That body...\u201d Jessie whistled and winked over her shoulder. \u201cWorld class, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Simone asked with a lifted brow. \u201cHas he been running around your place buck-assed naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But last summer? I saw him wearing a pair of board shorts and a really great tan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since Simone had started at Sky Blue six months ago, she wasn\u2019t aware of Jessie\u2019s history with the McKays, Brandt in particular. Which hadn\u2019t been all bad, because Simone saw her as Jessie, her work pal, her sometime barhopping buddy. Not as that-poor-young-widow-Jessie-and-isn\u2019t-it-a-shame-her-husband-ran-around-on-her-all-the-time phrase the locals used to describe her. She shuddered to think what other description had been added since Landon\u2019s appearance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? No shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shirt. And if you think he\u2019s drool-worthy in Wranglers? You oughta see that perfect butt and those muscled legs in the flesh. Not to mention how awesomely buff his chest is. Totally lickable. I\u2019ve known him for four years and I had no idea the man had pipes like that.\u201d This was the fun part hanging with Simone; she could say whatever popped into her head and Simone didn\u2019t judge her for it. Simone didn\u2019t consider Jessie too sweet or too innocent looking to have such lewd thoughts or call bullshit on Jessie\u2019s opinion.</p> <p>Not that what she\u2019d just said about Brandt McKay\u2019s slamming body was bullshit. It was all too real and all too close.</p><p>\u201cI oughta slap some sense into you, Jessie girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause to hear you talk about cowboy hottie, you\u2019ve been paying very close attention to him a lot longer than you\u2019ll admit to. Which means you want him.\u201d</p><p>Duh. But she couldn\u2019t have him.</p> <p>Why not?</p><p>Because I fear he\u2019s a package deal and he wants more than I\u2019m willing to give him.</p><p>Two raps sounded on the door. She and Simone whirled around to see...Brandt McKay lounging in the doorway.</p><p>Holy freakin\u2019 crap. Had he heard their raunchy girl talk, with him starring front and center?</p><p>\u201cHey, cowboy hottie. We were just talking about\u2014ow! Jessie, what the hell?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d pelted Simone with a marker to shut her up. \u201cSorry. It must\u2019ve slipped.\u201d She ignored the wash of humiliation and focused on cowboy hottie. Dammit. Now Simone even had her calling him that.</p> <p>\u201cBrandt. I thought you left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>So he had heard them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. I realized I forgot Landon\u2019s snow boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. They\u2019re in his cubby. I\u2019ll grab them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where his cubby is.\u201d He crouched and pulled the boots from the bottom shelf. \u201cI figured he might get a little muddy this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all that rodeoin\u2019 and wild McKay man time.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her quizzically, which made her curious about which part of the conversation he\u2019d overheard.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, a little testily.</p><p>\u201cJust wondering where you ladies were headed to tonight?\u201d</p><p>Simone shrugged. \u201cWherever, whenever and whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is Simone\u2019s way of telling you she doesn\u2019t have a freakin\u2019 clue what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, wherever you end up, if you have a little too much liquid fun and need a ride, just call. I\u2019d be happy to pick you up and take you home.\u201d</p><p>She knew Brandt meant both of them, but he didn\u2019t look at Simone even once. \u201cThanks, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep it in mind,\u201d Simone inserted smoothly. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to have a man on standby.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s intense gaze never strayed from hers. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m very familiar with, isn\u2019t it, Jessie? Bein\u2019 on standby.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth became desert dry and her tongue useless.</p><p>\u201cLater, ladies.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>She sagged against the wall. Another reminder that everything had changed last night. Not only when he\u2019d held her tightly and told her to scream her frustration into the wind and darkness. After returning to her house and tucking Landon in bed, they\u2019d sat on the couch, heckling some stupid horror movie. At some point, she\u2019d curled into him and had fallen asleep. Then she was in Brandt\u2019s arms. He hadn\u2019t done more than tenderly brush her hair from her face after depositing her on the bed fully clothed, but it\u2019d felt intimate. It\u2019d left her unsettled. Mostly because it\u2019d left her wanting more of him.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Jessie.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze zoomed to Simone\u2019s. \u201cSorry. What did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019re hitting the pizza and beer joint. And you\u2019re gonna tell me everything about your past with the cowboy hottie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguing. And if you\u2019re lucky, I won\u2019t rail on you too hard for being a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I an idiot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not snapping that man up. I swear I\u2019ve never seen any man look so ready to lick a woman up one side and down the other as he was when he was eating you up with his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr given his family history, he might chew me up and spit me out,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Pride and fear are best left in the past when it\u2019s obvious he wants to be part of your future.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell. How was she supposed to respond to that? Especially when she suspected Simone would retract that statement after she heard the sordid truth about the situation?</p><p>Jessie\u2019s house was way too quiet. Sad, how quickly she\u2019d gotten used to Brandt and Landon\u2019s presence in the last five days\u2014which would make it ten times harder when they were both gone for good.</p><p>Rather than dwell on what she couldn\u2019t change, or spend a perfectly beautiful Saturday moping, she took action. She whipped up a spice cake with rum frosting. Then she loaded Lexie and the cake in the truck and drove to Sky Blue for a box of stuff she\u2019d intended to donate to the women\u2019s shelter.</p><p>How would Brandt take her unexpected appearance at his place? More importantly, what did it mean that she was making the first move?</p><p>After talking to Simone last night, Jessie was beginning to see Brandt in a different light. But she wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it, or if Brandt would ever agree to her new condition. Or if she had the guts to actually broach the subject with him.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d parked at Brandt\u2019s place, McKay men surrounded her truck.</p><p>Maybe they\u2019d smelled food.</p><p>She started to open the door when Brandt elbowed Dalton aside to get there first. \u201cJess! Hey, I\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>Damn he looked good. Relaxed. And honestly happy she\u2019d showed up.</p><p>Dalton sniffed. \u201cIs that...cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you? Part bloodhound?\u201d Tell shoved him and grinned at her. \u201cBut please tell me it\u2019s cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s cake. Spice cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough for me. I\u2019ll put it inside so these two don\u2019t eat it all.\u201d He grabbed the pan and said, \u201cBe right back,\u201d as Dalton followed him inside.</p><p>She said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Landon?\u201d to Tell.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He pointed to a dirt mound. Landon sat in the midst of a pile of small shovels and Tonka trucks of every size and shape.</p><p>\u201cAre those new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me\u2019n Dalton were at the feed store so we got some boy toys for Landon.\u201d</p><p>That was so cute, and heartening, they were taking an interest in their nephew.</p><p>\u201cBesides, we all loved playin\u2019 in the dirt. He\u2019s a McKay. Figured he would too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the true test of a McKay male is seeing how dirty he can get his damn clothes on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>Funny how she\u2019d forgotten how filthy Luke\u2019s clothes were after he finished up on the ranch. Funny how she\u2019d forgotten how much of her life had been devoted to putting Luke\u2019s needs first. Still, she couldn\u2019t help but smile at the dirt-covered urchin lost in muddy playtime. \u201cLandon looks like he\u2019s having a ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is now. But he was damn cranky when he woke up. I think he was missin\u2019 you, Jess.\u201d</p><p>She gave Tell a droll look. \u201cSuch a suck up. I already said you could have some cake.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time because we were about to play football. And I\u2019m draftin\u2019 you to my team because I don\u2019t think Landon is gonna be much help in the tackling department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re playing tackle football?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlag football is for pussies.\u201d Tell bumped her with his hip. \u201cCome on. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun. Right. It\u2019s all fun and games until someone breaks an arm or gets a concussion.\u201d</p><p>But Tell wasn\u2019t listening to her. He waved to Dalton and Brandt as they ambled closer. \u201cGuess who\u2019s on my team, suckas?\u201d</p><p>Dalton loomed over her. \u201cIf you think we\u2019re goin\u2019 easy on you since you\u2019re a girl, Jessie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be exactly right,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cBecause she is not playin\u2019 football with us.\u201d</p><p>What? Not that Jessie had a burning desire to chase around a pigskin, but who was Brandt to decide what she could and couldn\u2019t do?</p><p>Tell said, \u201cOh shit. Now you did it, bro.\u201d</p><p>Jessie got in Brandt\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t make decisions for me. Don\u2019t made assumptions about me. And you sure as hell better never speak for me, Brandt McKay. Understood?\u201d</p><p>Everyone froze.</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jessie placed her hands on Brandt\u2019s chest and playfully shoved him. \u201cYou are goin\u2019 down, buddy. Me\u2019n Tell are gonna whup your sorry butts.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cBring it. No cryin\u2019 for mercy when I\u2019ve got you pinned down.\u201d</p><p>When Brandt grinned at her like that? Sexy and mischievous? Her heart went into free fall.</p><p>Tell tugged on her arm. \u201cCome on, killer, let\u2019s devise a strategy.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately Tell\u2019s strategy consisted of handing Jessie the ball damn near every time, while he tried to tackle both his brothers at the same time. Which never worked. Which meant Jessie spent a lot of time hitting the ground. She did score one touchdown, but she suspected they\u2019d let her score out of pity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she waited for the next play, she realized it\u2019d been ages since she\u2019d goofed around outside with no real purpose. Likewise, Brandt, Tell and Dalton worked in the great outdoors every day, no matter what the weather did, so they tended to stay indoors when they finished for the day.</p><p>Maybe the sunshine and crisp air had brought out her melancholy. But it bolstered her spirits to see these three banding together outside of the hours they spent working on the ranch. It hadn\u2019t always been that way, due to Casper\u2019s tendency to pit his sons against each other, so at least one good thing had come out of Luke\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cStop chasin\u2019 butterflies, Jess, and pay attention,\u201d Tell shouted right before he threw her the ball.</p> <p>She yelled, \u201cCrap!\u201d but somehow managed to catch the football. Then she took off.</p><p>Behind her came a loud oof as her teammate tackled one of his brothers, but she didn\u2019t stop to see which one, because guaranteed, the other one was chasing her.</p><p>She\u2019d almost reached the goal line\u2014a stick jammed in a dirt pile\u2014when she was brought down.</p><p>Hard. Hitting the ground on her side with a bone-jarring thud knocked the wind right out of her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move. She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>\u201cJess? God, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Brandt rolled her on her back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No air had entered her lungs yet. Her eyelids seemed glued shut.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Gentle hands swept the hair from her face. \u201cCome on, sweetheart. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps stopped by her head.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Brandt. How fucking hard did you hit her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t think it was that hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you knock her unconscious?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She hasn\u2019t moved.\u201d</p><p>Tell said, \u201cMaybe you oughta give her mouth-to-mouth or something.\u201d</p><p>Jessie gasped and her eyes flew open.</p><p>Brandt was in her face, blocking her view of anything but him. Panic darkened his eyes. Distress lined his forehead. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just knocked the wind out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhere else are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t believe her. He unzipped her coat and curled his hands around her ribs beneath her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWhat about here? Does this hurt?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She really wasn\u2019t hurt, but having Brandt so concerned about her and putting those rough hands of his all over her? Well, there was the upside to getting tackled.</p><p>His palms slowly slid down her belly. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>Again, she shook her head.</p><p>His big hands slid further down to circle her hips. \u201cFeel like anything is bruised or out of joint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, why don\u2019t you just cut the shit and volunteer to kiss her all over and make it better,\u201d</p><p>Dalton taunted, adding kissing noises.</p><p>Tell smacked him in the arm. \u201cShut it, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze winged between Dalton and Tell, kneeling beside Brandt. \u201cYou saw me pass the goal line, right? That counted as a touchdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pass the goal line,\u201d Dalton scoffed. \u201cSee? You dropped the football well short of the goal.\u201d</p><p>They all turned and looked at where Dalton was pointing, which was why they didn\u2019t see Landon barreling toward them until he landed on Brandt\u2019s back with a happy shriek.</p><p>Luckily Tell and Dalton pulled the boy free, but not before Brandt fell forward, blocking Jessie\u2019s body with his.</p><p>Tell laughed. \u201cSeems like someone wants to play football. Maybe you are good at tackling after all.</p><p>Come on, squirt.\u201d He stood, tucking Landon under his arm like a football and Dalton gave chase\u2014much to Landon\u2019s delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re smilin\u2019. You scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scared you? You\u2019re the one who hit me like this was the last four seconds in the Superbowl.\u201d</p><p>Brandt pushed to his feet and held out his hands. \u201cCome on. Up you go.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she was upright, she grabbed his biceps to steady herself, which brought them close. Very close.</p><p>When Jessie looked into Brandt\u2019s eyes, he wore the oddest expression. So when he touched her cheek, almost reverently, with a hoarse, \u201cChrist, you\u2019re so pretty,\u201d she wondered if maybe he hadn\u2019t hit his head at some point.</p><p>\u201cYou guys playin\u2019 or what?\u201d Dalton yelled.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cI think I\u2019ll sit this one out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go inside and cut the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd take some aspirin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>But her feet wouldn\u2019t budge. Neither would Brandt\u2019s. They stared at one another and something just...clicked.</p><p>\u201cCome on guys,\u201d Tell shouted.</p><p>Brandt smiled before he turned and jogged to his brothers.</p><p>Grateful for the time to regroup, she sliced the cake and carried in the boxes from the daycare. By then the boys\u2019d had enough football and were starving.</p><p>They demolished the cake in one sitting.</p><p>Brandt bathed a dirt-covered Landon, leaving her with Tell and Dalton, listening to their Saturday night plans.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great band playin\u2019 at Ziggy\u2019s tonight,\u201d Dalton suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it always gets so damn crowded on Saturday nights,\u201d Tell said. \u201cWhat else is goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard Busby is havin\u2019 a party at his place.\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember his last party? Hell, most of those \u2018hot\u2019 girls he promised us were jailbait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Dalton repeatedly tossed a tennis ball into the air. \u201cI wish we could go to that strip club in Wheatland. That\u2019s always a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso true,\u201d Tell said. He looked at Jessie. \u201cBrandt said you were goin\u2019 out on the town last night.</p><p>What did you end up doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimone and I went to the Pizza Barn for pizza and beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>Tell rolled his eyes. \u201cBrandt made it sound like you were goin\u2019 out, getting wild and getting laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt said that? About me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Brandt retorted. \u201cI said you had plans. That\u2019s it.\u201d He sat Landon on the couch next to Jessie.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a liar,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI remember exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d Tell grabbed his coat. \u201cThanks for the cake, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was good,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>Brandt frowned at his brothers. \u201cYou guys comin\u2019 back here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hopefully we\u2019ll be getting wild and getting laid.\u201d They sailed out the door.</p><p>Jessie watched Landon scramble off the couch and head to the boxes she\u2019d brought in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re those?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cSome stuff we don\u2019t use at Sky Blue I thought Landon might like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Do you mind keepin\u2019 an eye on him while I shower?\u201d</p><p>Do you mind if I keep an eye on you while you shower?</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Sure. No problem.\u201d</p><p>Her mom called and they chatted about Thanksgiving plans since Jessie had promised to spend the holiday in Riverton. She watched Landon while she talked. He\u2019d thrown the toys from both boxes all over the floor, but he\u2019d stopped tossing things when he reached the stack of books. He\u2019d stayed in one place and flipped through them slowly, mesmerized, as if he\u2019d never seen a book before.</p><p>The truth hit her and she felt like she\u2019d had the wind knocked out of her again. She studied Landon so closely she was barely aware when Brandt sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She pointed at Landon, who hadn\u2019t noticed Brandt entering the room either, which was a first.</p><p>Brandt whispered, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re surprised he\u2019s bein\u2019 good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Look at him. It\u2019s like he\u2019s never seen a book before. I can\u2019t believe...\u201d She closed her eyes and dropped her chin to her chest.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Brandt brought her face toward his. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, hating that once again Brandt would witness her tears. \u201cWhat kind of mother doesn\u2019t read to her child? Or at least give him books to look at himself? My God. Do you know how much my heart aches for him...\u201d Her voice cracked. She tried to turn away, but Brandt pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing that for him. See? Can you imagine how excited he\u2019s gonna be when you sit down with him and read those books to him?\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s pulse raced when she felt Brandt\u2019s warm lips brush her forehead, above her eyebrow, her temple, her damp cheek.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I asked for your help. Because you\u2019re cryin\u2019 for a little boy who\u2019s never had what another child would take for granted. And I know this heart of yours, Jessie. I suspect by next week Landon will have more books in his possession than any other kid in the state of Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>She laughed against his neck.</p><p>Brandt kissed her temple. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t so sure. It was getting harder to stick to her original plan of thinking as Landon only as another long-term daycare assignment. With each day, he was becoming less an obligation, more a joy.</p><p>That scared her to death. Because guaranteed, even though he was small, he still was just another McKay male who would eventually break her heart.</p><p>She wiggled out of Brandt\u2019s embrace and put some distance between them. \u201cI\u2019d better be getting home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stay. Me\u2019n Landon are gonna have a gourmet meal tonight and you\u2019re welcome to share it with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGourmet meal?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSpaghettios. And canned peaches for dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting, but I wouldn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d She crouched down by Landon and straightened the seam on his footie pajamas. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll leave the books here, but tomorrow night, I\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll start having story time before bed. Does that sound good?\u201d When she smoothed his damp hair from his brow, he looked at her with those enormous blue eyes. Then he crawled closer and held his arms out for her to pick him up.</p><p>Definitely gonna break my heart, kid.</p> <p>She planted a kiss on his sweet-smelling cheek before handing him to Brandt and going home.</p><p>Jessie was surprised to see Brandt\u2019s truck pull in the next day around noon. She hung the bucket on the fence and walked to his rig as he finished carting Landon\u2019s stuff into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s cousin died yesterday. Of course, my dad has refused to take her to the funeral in Nebraska. And since she doesn\u2019t want to go by herself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou volunteered.\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed his gloved hand across his forehead, knocking his hat askew. \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. I know I seem to be sayin\u2019 that to you a lot lately, but short of takin\u2019 Landon with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re trying to set a routine for him, so it\u2019s best if he stays with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Plus it\u2019s not like you have any other choices besides me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe funeral is Tuesday afternoon. We\u2019ll leave right after and be home late Tuesday night, so Mom wants to go to the family memorial tonight. We\u2019re takin\u2019 off in about an hour.\u201d</p><p>How was it that after only spending a week together she already knew she was going to miss him?</p><p>She reached up and fixed his hat, which pleased him, by the way his eyes softened.</p><p>\u201cJessie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt. It\u2019s okay.\u201d She skirted him and released Landon from his carseat, propping him on her hip.</p><p>She forced a smile and said, \u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Day two of Landon screaming was more than Jessie could take. She knew it wasn\u2019t Brandt\u2019s fault that he\u2019d had to leave, but it was little comfort when she\u2019d been up half the damn night with a cranky toddler.</p> <p>All Landon wanted was to be held. But not held while she was sitting down. No, she\u2019d paced the floor with him in her arms because constant movement was the only thing that soothed him. She\u2019d begun to suspect he was cutting molars, the way he constantly gnawed on his blanket.</p><p>She\u2019d had no choice but to bring him to work with her. The other kids in the daycare didn\u2019t seem to mind that Landon clung to Jessie like a monkey and screeched like one if she set him down. Everyone would\u2019ve been better off if she\u2019d been able to stay home. But that wasn\u2019t an option. How did single mothers handle all this by themselves? Juggling work and a sick kid?</p><p>Around noon Skylar came in to have lunch with her girls and she kept stealing glances at Landon.</p><p>What if Landon really was sick? And by bringing him here she\u2019d somehow infected all the other kids? Flu and colds spread like wildfire in daycare. They took every precaution to prevent it, but kids\u2019 immune systems weren\u2019t fully developed. No matter how much bleach, hand sanitizer and Lysol they used, regardless of how many times hands were washed after runny noses were wiped, there was bound to be germs passed around.</p><p>So how was she supposed to know when it was something serious and not just the effects of teething or a cranky toddler?</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Despite the fact she spent her days taking care of kids, this child health stuff was a mystery. Parents told her when their kid was sick. She rarely had to make that determination on her own, which made her feel even more helpless when she looked at Landon and couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with the poor little boy.</p><p>After Skylar finished lunch, she took Jessie aside. \u201cI thought we were through his adjustment phase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. He started getting fussy Sunday night and I thought maybe it was because Brandt wasn\u2019t around. But yesterday it got a little worse. He was fussier than normal. Last night after I took him home?</p><p>He was awful. Upset. Crying all the time. I think he\u2019s teething. He hardly slept. I hardly slept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt didn\u2019t get up and help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t there. He had to take his mom to a funeral in Nebraska. He got back at three in the morning and he\u2019s trying to play catch up at the ranch today. He\u2019ll be around to help me tonight. If I survive that long.\u201d</p><p>Skylar frowned and placed her hand on Landon\u2019s forehead. He didn\u2019t jerk away. \u201cHave you taken his temp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since this morning. It was around ninety-nine point four, which is not that far from normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe feels hot to me. How long has he been tugging on his ear like that?\u201d</p><p>Jessie glanced down. Sure enough, Landon had a chunk of the blanket jammed in his mouth, but he also had his finger hooked just inside his ear. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She looked at Skylar with utter confusion.</p><p>\u201cShould I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I doubt you could see it. I watched him from the lunch room and noticed it.\u201d Skylar smoothed her hand over Landon\u2019s hair. \u201cIt might be teething. It might be an ear infection. But I definitely think it\u2019s worth a trip to the doctor to find out.\u201d</p><p>Jessie must\u2019ve appeared dazed because Skylar said, \u201cCall Brandt. He\u2019s been in contact with Landon\u2019s mother, he\u2019ll have the information on what doctor to take him to.\u201d</p><p>Would they give him a shot? Take blood? How could she watch them poking him when he was already in so much misery?</p><p>\u201cOut here in the wilds of Wyoming it\u2019ll probably take the rest of the day, once you actually get an appointment at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t be gone from here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess. Go. I\u2019ll handle the daycare.\u201d</p><p>She stared at Skylar, feeling mountains of regret as well as gratitude. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Kids get sick. You know that. And while I\u2019m on the subject...if Landon does have an ear infection, it wouldn\u2019t be from something you\u2019ve done or not done regarding his care. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now.\u201d She set her chin on top of Landon\u2019s head. The poor kid was burning up. \u201cThank you. Not only for being so understanding, but for the advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of this parenting stuff comes naturally, no matter what anyone tells you. It\u2019s live and learn.</p><p>And usually, the first baby ends up being the guinea pig. Poor Eliza, huh?\u201d She smiled. \u201cGo call Brandt.</p><p>Let me know what you find out from the doctor.\u201d</p><p>For some reason it made Jessie feel better that Brandt exhibited the same initial panicked reaction she had. He called Dr. Monroe and set up an appointment, then called Jessie back, promising he\u2019d meet her at the doctor\u2019s office in Sundance after he cleaned up.</p><p>By the time she finished a couple things, got Landon loaded, and traveled the less than ideal road conditions, she figured Brandt would beat her to the doctor\u2019s office.</p><p>Sure enough, he jumped out of his truck the second he saw her. He didn\u2019t look in the rear cab, at Landon. He cupped his hand over Jessie\u2019s cheek. His eyes roamed her face. \u201cHoney, no offense, but you look like hell.\u201d</p><p>Jessie gave him equal scrutiny. \u201cYou don\u2019t look one hundred percent rested yourself, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She sensed something else was bothering him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunerals suck. I didn\u2019t know my mom\u2019s cousin, but she was really close to him at one time. It was weird, bein\u2019 around those people, who are just as much my relatives as the McKays, and I know nothin\u2019</p><p>about any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it make you sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It made me aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat it might be like for Landon in the future with us.\u201d</p><p>Jessie bit back the next question\u2014how far Brandt would go to ensure Landon wouldn\u2019t be a stranger in the McKay family.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s thumb arced over her cheekbone, beneath her eye, in such a loving move she had no idea how she resisted the temptation to lean into his gentle touch. It\u2019d been so long since she\u2019d been touched. So very long.</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>Landon cried out and the moment ended.</p><p>The three of them trooped into the doctor\u2019s office. Which was completely full. Completely full of people she knew.</p><p>Great.</p><p>She held Landon on her lap while Brandt filled out the paperwork. Finally Brandt gave up on deciphering the Title IXX forms and agreed to pay cash for the visit, since Landon didn\u2019t have health insurance.</p><p>Brandt tried to take Landon from her, to give her arms a break from constantly holding him, but Landon shrieked and wouldn\u2019t let go of her.</p><p>This brought the attention of the whole room their way. Whatever buzz their appearance generated that\u2019d kept people gossiping amongst themselves for twenty minutes ended.</p><p>A woman Jessie recognized as one of the local bar rats with half a dozen kids from half a dozen husbands sidled in front of them. Her gaze flicked from Landon to Brandt. She smiled. \u201cBrandt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrancie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in Ziggy\u2019s for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen busy. You know how that goes.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze zeroed in on Landon. \u201cI guess you have been busy. I didn\u2019t know you had a kid.\u201d</p><p>The way she cooed it, as if she was considering him as father material for her kids, set Jessie\u2019s teeth on edge.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. This is my nephew. He\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>Most people would\u2019ve gotten the hint and left. Not this woman. She switched her curiosity to Jessie.</p><p>\u201cI know you. You used to come in to Ziggy\u2019s once in a while with\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKeely McKay? We hung around for a while during dart league season last year.\u201d</p><p>When the woman\u2019s eyes took on a mean glint, Jessie realized this bar wench probably knew more about Luke\u2019s nocturnal activities than she did. \u201cNo. You used to come in with your husband. Luke, right?</p><p>Although I\u2019ll admit he came in by himself frequently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, I doubt he\u2019s been in recently since he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Brandt stilled next to her, shocked by her smartass response.</p><p>Jessie was sick of feigning ignorance about Luke\u2019s blatant infidelity. Better to go on the offensive than to cower in the corner because she\u2019d done that for years and she was finished with the timid routine.</p><p>But Francie kept digging for dirt. \u201cSo is this your son?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cNo. But he is Luke\u2019s son. My dead husband\u2019s secret love child, who I had no idea existed until recently. And yes, I am taking care of him while his mother cleans up her act in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Francie was dumbfounded, not only by Jessie\u2019s tart response, but by the biting edge to her tone.</p><p>\u201cAny more ridiculously invasive questions? No? Good. But you\u2019re more than welcome to fling this really juicy piece of gossip around the bar tonight to get your fair share of free drinks.\u201d</p><p>Dismissed, Francie stomped off.</p><p>A solid minute passed before Brandt drawled, \u201cHave I mentioned how much I like your new \u2018screw you\u2019 attitude? I didn\u2019t think you had it in you, Jess.\u201d</p><p>His opinion meant more than she wanted to admit. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had it in me either. I wouldn\u2019t have done that a year ago. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to draw attention to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve definitely got my attention.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then again, you\u2019ve always had it.\u201d</p><p>Jessie faced him. Her pulse spiked when she realized how close their heads were. She could make out every one of his absurdly long black eyelashes. She could see the imperceptible flecks of green in Brandt\u2019s deep blue eyes. She noticed the bump in his nose where it\u2019d been broken in his younger years. She could feel his every quick exhale teasing her lips. She wanted so badly to drop her gaze and leisurely take in the full measure of his mouth, but she didn\u2019t dare. Because for some crazy, mixed-up reason, probably due to lack of sleep, she doubted she\u2019d be satisfied with just a peek at his lips. She\u2019d want a taste. A full taste.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s twisting me in knots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut unless you wanna add more fuel to Francie\u2019s fire, you\u2019d better stop lookin\u2019 at me like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you want...well, mostly like you don\u2019t hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt, I don\u2019t hate you. I\u2019ve never hated you. It\u2019d be easier if I could. But I can\u2019t. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>Whispering to him while staring into his eyes created an odd sort of intimacy.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything, just continued gazing at her with those compelling eyes, she felt that pull between them get stronger.</p><p>\u201cLandon McKay?\u201d the nurse said from the doorway.</p><p>Another untimely interruption, but Jessie didn\u2019t dwell on it, nor did she bother seeing where all the curious looks were coming from in the waiting room. She stood, wincing when she shifted Landon to her left side. She thought she\u2019d built up a strong set muscles from working with horses and hauling hay bales, but holding a toddler for hours on end used a whole different muscle group.</p><p>Brandt noticed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been holding Landon nonstop since Sunday. My arms are sore. My back is sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take him.\u201d Landon was so exhausted he went into Brandt\u2019s arms without fussing.</p><p>The wait for Doctor Monroe to appear was remarkably short. She bustled into the room. Frowned.</p><p>\u201cHas the nurse been in yet for a height and weight check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta do that first. Strip him down and Fiona will be right in.\u201d Then she left.</p><p>Landon hated getting naked. So by the time they\u2019d undressed him down to his diaper, he was screaming mad. He wouldn\u2019t stand so the nurse could measure him. They ended up using the baby scale to weigh him. He was fighting Brandt at every turn, giving Jessie such pitiful eyes, that she had to look away.</p><p>Which made him madder yet.</p><p>Doctor Monroe bustled into the room. Brandt gave up and let Landon run to Jessie, screaming,</p><p>\u201cMama, mama, mama,\u201d throwing himself at her.</p><p>Jessie froze. The tension in the room doubled. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time he\u2019s called me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised it hasn\u2019t happened before. To some extent, given the circumstances, the women in his life are interchangeable,\u201d Doctor Monroe said.</p><p>\u201cLike father like son,\u201d slipped out before Jessie could stop it.</p><p>Doc Monroe ignored her, but she felt Brandt\u2019s probing gaze.</p><p>Once Landon was seated on Jessie\u2019s lap, he was fairly docile. He let the doctor poke and prod him, all the while she kept up a light chattering tone that soothed him. When the doc checked his ears, she sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cKid\u2019s got an ear infection all right. Poor thing.\u201d She rubbed his bare back before she rolled away to jot down notes. She addressed Brandt. \u201cDid Landon\u2019s mother tell you if he\u2019s allergic to penicillin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>Doc Monroe looked at Jessie. \u201cWas Luke allergic to penicillin? The allergy tends to have genetic properties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, far as I know Luke wasn\u2019t allergic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I suggest a shot of penicillin. Sometimes I treat this type of infection with amoxycillin but the shot works faster. Plus, you won\u2019t have to mess with trying to get him to take his medicine, since he seems a little strong willed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo surprise\u2014he is a McKay,\u201d Jessie muttered.</p><p>Doctor Monroe shut the file folder. She smiled at both of them, but it was strained. \u201cKids heal quickly. He\u2019ll have to stick around for twenty minutes or so after the shot to see if he has an allergic reaction. If he\u2019s not better after forty-eight hours, bring him in right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Jessie got the feeling that Doctor Monroe disapproved of this situation with Landon and she gave them both an odd look before she left the room.</p><p>\u201cI see what you\u2019re thinkin\u2019,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cAnd yes, she argued with me about askin\u2019 for your help with Landon.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cHow did she know you intended to ask me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her. I brought Landon in for a checkup after hours the week Samantha went to jail. She grilled me on how I planned to take care of him so I asked her opinion. She said I was self-serving and stormed out of the room after she signed off on the physical documentation for temporary guardianship.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Monroe had performed the D&amp;C after Jessie\u2019s miscarriage. She\u2019d recommended the yearlong wait before they attempted another pregnancy, and by that time, she and Luke were having problems, so she\u2019d stayed on the pill. But the doc knew how devastated Jessie had been about losing that baby. It gave her a rush of gratitude that the doctor knew losing another child, albeit not one from her womb, might cause her sorrow.</p><p>Would it? Or will you be glad to hand this boy back to his mother?</p><p>The nurse came in. \u201cHe gets this one in the butt, so you\u2019ll need to take his diaper off.\u201d</p><p>Brandt plucked Landon from Jessie\u2019s lap, turned the kid over his knee as he pulled back the diaper tape, exposing Landon\u2019s left buttock. He held the squirming boy firmly as the nurse swooped in with\u2014holy crap\u2014a really big needle and jabbed Landon\u2019s tiny butt cheek.</p><p>Landon screamed bloody murder.</p><p>The nurse was fast. She pressed on a Spider-Man bandage on the spot and Brandt had the diaper refastened in a hurry.</p><p>Landon practically jumped into Jessie\u2019s arms. Her stomach clenched, seeing him so scared. She slipped his clothes on, trying to calm him. When she looked up, Brandt had the oddest expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get mad, okay? But you\u2019re good with him. Better than I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t snap off a smart comment, it\u2019d serve no purpose. She hefted him up onto her hip. She winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll wait here with him. Just pay the bill and I\u2019ll meet you back at my house.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom. I understand you wanna see him, but he won\u2019t be much fun with an ear infection. Okay.</p><p>I\u2019ll ask her. Yes, I promise. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Brandt tossed his cell on the seat and rubbed his eyes. Jesus, he was tired. It\u2019d been a long couple of days. Traveling, a funeral, the guilt of leaving Jessie alone with Landon. He wanted to drink a couple of beers, watch TV and crash. But that probably wasn\u2019t in the cards tonight.</p><p>Plus, he had a surprise for Jessie. Things had been going great between them today, up until the point she pushed him out of the doctor\u2019s office. Her text requesting items they needed from the store had been curt, but texts often were, so he wondered what kind of mood she\u2019d be in. He grabbed the grocery bags and headed inside her trailer to find out.</p><p>First thing he noticed was the quiet. And the heavenly smell.</p><p>Jessie tossed a quick glance over her shoulder. \u201cHow were the roads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d He set the bags on the kitchen table. \u201cLandon sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>Brandt moved in behind her and placed his hands on her shoulders, which were hunched up by her ears. She immediately relaxed a little. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here the last couple days. Especially since Landon has been sick.\u201d She hadn\u2019t shrugged him off, so he kept his hands right where they were. \u201cTell me something, Jess. Have you thought about backing out of this deal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe last night when I was up walking the floor with him at four a.m. I considered loading Landon up and driving to your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>While she struggled\u2014Brandt sensed she wanted to say something\u2014just for a second, he closed his eyes and pretended this was a normal night in his life. A sweet, sexy wife to come home to. Supper on the stove. A cold beer nearby. As the phantom life teased him, he inhaled slowly. The scent of her shampoo drifted into his nose, filled his lungs. The scent was hard to place\u2014a mix of fruit and honey. But beneath that aroma was the undeniable heady scent of Jessie. Which was better than any perfume in the world.</p> <p>\u201cBrandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d He let his thumbs sweep across the muscles between her shoulder blades.</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018backing out of this deal\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I getting out of this deal?\u201d</p> <p>That snapped him out of his fantasy lickety-split. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. But I\u2019m thinking about...some things.\u201d</p><p>Brandt angled just a little closer. \u201cAnything you want, Jessie, all you have to do is name it and it\u2019s yours. Anything.\u201d Before Brandt felt cocky or relieved, or hell, even hopeful she\u2019d wrap herself around him and kiss him, she bolted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get these groceries put away, huh?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d didn\u2019t push it, not now anyway.</p><p>Landon woke up about halfway through Brandt\u2019s first beer. The kid started out cranky, but that morphed into sweetness after Brandt dosed him with grape-flavored Tylenol. Landon dragged his blanket with him and curled into Brandt as he sat on the couch, watching the news.</p> <p>Even Lexie sensed something was wrong with her tormentor. She sniffed his feet and put her head on Brandt\u2019s lap so she could lick Landon\u2019s hand.</p><p>Landon wasn\u2019t interested in eating Jessie\u2019s beef and noodle casserole. He didn\u2019t suck down his bottle like a junkie, either. Brandt hated to watch Jessie eating alone, but he couldn\u2019t move now that Landon had finally settled down.</p><p>After about an hour, Jessie said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tuck him in bed? I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll wake up. He\u2019s had a rough couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have you.\u201d Brandt grinned at her. \u201cWant me to tuck you in bed too?\u201d</p><p>Jessie blinked. Blushed. Then a sneaky smile stole across her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>When Brandt returned from putting Landon down, Jessie was washing dishes. He rolled up his sleeves, snagged an embroidered dishtowel and stood beside her. Right beside her.</p><p>She gave him a strange look. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpin\u2019. Doesn\u2019t seem fair that you cooked supper and have to wash the dirty dishes too.\u201d He rinsed a plate and began to dry it, still feeling her eyes on him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt your service.\u201d</p><p>They chatted easily, although Brandt was surprised by how long it took to wash dishes with two people...until he realized, Jessie was dragging out their time together as much as he was.</p><p>Don\u2019t hope, man. You\u2019ve done this before and it nearly destroyed you.</p><p>When she began to rub the back of her arm, Brandt took a chance. \u201cWant me to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. It\u2019ll probably be fine by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because after I left the doctor\u2019s office today I stopped by Healing Touch Massage and talked to AJ. I told her you\u2019d been carting Landon around nonstop for three days, and she gave me some specific pointers on how to loosen up those muscles.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cSeriously? You did that? For me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think you understand how bad I felt leavin\u2019 you here with him, when I promised that wouldn\u2019t happen. So I\u2019d like to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy giving me a massage?\u201d</p><p>Brandt held up his hands in the face of her obvious skepticism. \u201cNo biggie if you don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould my clothes be on? Or off?\u201d</p><p>Think with your head, not your dick. Do not blow this. \u201cI believe AJ said the part of your body bein\u2019</p><p>massaged needed to be uncovered. So since it\u2019d be an arm and back massage, probably I could work around a...short-sleeved T-shirt or something.\u201d</p><p>A thoughtful look crossed her face. \u201cHow about if I wore a sports bra?\u201d</p><p>Hell yes. And maybe some of those ass-hugging boy shorts. \u201cAh sure. I suppose that\u2019d be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere we doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your bedroom,\u201d slipped out right away. Dammit.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Give me about five minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d That\u2019d allow him time to brush his teeth, shave, see if he\u2019d brought four or five condoms...</p><p>No. He had to be a perfect gentleman. Just a massage. Nothing else.</p><p>That sucked.</p><p>He drank the rest of his beer in the kitchen. At the five minute and thirteen second mark, he knocked on her bedroom door. \u201cJess? You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Brandt stepped over the threshold and the first thing he noticed was her butt. She hadn\u2019t worn sweats, but ass-hugging workout shorts.</p><p>Do not do a celebratory fist pump, man. Act casual.</p><p>His gaze leisurely followed the curve of her back, the very sexy, very feminine curve of her back, stopping when his eyes reached the wide band of her black sports bra. It criss-crossed between her shoulder blades and the straps separated and disappeared down her front.</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten what all that creamy, mouthwatering flesh looked like in the flesh.</p><p>Jessie looked at him strangely. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just realized I forgot to ask AJ one thing. Where am I supposed to sit when I\u2019m givin\u2019 you a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. How about if we both sit on the bed. You can sit behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>She sat in the middle and crossed her legs.</p><p>Okay. Brandt had to keep his groin from touching her backside because then she\u2019d know he had a hard-on, which had popped up the instant it\u2019d gotten wind he\u2019d be putting his hands all over her.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d He scooted behind her, trying to spread his legs out, but damn, he wasn\u2019t very flexible.</p><p>Maybe he could reach her from here. When he brushed his fingers across the slope of her shoulder, she jumped.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you wanna do this?\u201d Killed him to say it, but he did anyway.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s just...I\u2019ve never had a massage before and it\u2019s awkward to sit like this when I can\u2019t see you.</p><p>It just startled me.\u201d She stopped babbling and sighed. \u201cThe truth is, no man\u2019s hands have touched me in a really long time, and I think I forgot how to act when it\u2019s anyone\u2019s hands but my own on my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is supposed to be relaxing you, not makin\u2019 you nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Let\u2019s try again.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d This time when Brandt put his hands on her, she didn\u2019t flinch. Her skin was so warm. So soft. So pale, compared to his rough knuckles and sun-soaked flesh. When he dug his thumb into the base of her neck, she moaned.</p><p>\u201cDid that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It feels good. Really good. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>He thoroughly massaged up and down both sides of her neck. Then he moved to arc of her shoulders, concentrating on the section between her shoulder blades. After that he branched out to her arms, earning another series of soft grunts and groans.</p><p>No matter how hard he tried, Brandt couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Jessie would make the same throaty sounds if he used his thumb on the sweet spot between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cGod, Brandt. If this whole ranching gig doesn\u2019t work out for you, I\u2019m thinking you could give massages for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment, although I wouldn\u2019t enjoy givin\u2019 someone like Bart Clarkson a rubdown.\u201d Brandt shivered, imagining the crotchety old timer\u2019s wrinkled skin and flabby ass. \u201cAnd I\u2019d hate to be accused of bein\u2019 sexist, because I\u2019d only wanna put my hands on ladies. Young ladies. Definitely would scar me for life to see some of the senior citizen set spread out on a massage table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut having a hot, young, studly cowboy rubbing them down?\u201d</p><p>Jessie had just called him hot and studly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d make a ton of money, and I bet your tips would be outta this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d Brandt smoothed his hands down her sides, somehow just knowing how ticklish she was.</p><p>She screamed, \u201cBrandt!\u201d and tried to squirm away from him.</p><p>He held fast, keeping hold of her ribs as she rolled, taking him with her. She wiggled to the other side of the bed, and Brandt released her, letting her think she\u2019d won.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Once she let down her guard, he pounced, she shrieked again, and he pressed her back into the mattress, squeezing her thighs together with his knees as he pinned her arms over her head. He leaned forward. \u201cI oughta tickle you until you cry for mercy for puttin\u2019 thoughts of nekkid octogenarians in my head right before I go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, some octogenarians are sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaquel Welch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t eighty. Besides, even if she is, she\u2019s the exception, not the rule.\u201d</p><p>Simultaneously they realized the intimacy of their position. Brandt stretched out over her, holding her down...and why wasn\u2019t Jessie trying to get away?</p><p>They stared at each other, but neither made a move to get closer or to break apart.</p><p>Brandt let go of her arms. \u201cI suppose any relaxation you had is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy muscles are still singing your praises. Thank you. It was an awesome massage.\u201d</p><p>He thought she\u2019d leap up and throw him out of her room, but Jessie studied him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d like me to return the favor?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself from sweeping her hair from her face, then gently running the back of his knuckles from her temple to her chin. This woman who\u2019d given so much, wanted to give more. \u201cNo. This was for you. I did it because I wanted to, Jessie. I enjoyed it, but I don\u2019t expect anything in return.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened. So did her body.</p><p>As much as he wanted to stay...That was his cue to leave.</p> <p>Brandt scooted backward on his hands and his knees until he was off the bed and his feet touched the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll get up with Landon tonight if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep. See you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He made it to the door before she said anything.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know my ticklish spots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. But I sure do know them all now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a little huskily, and said, \u201cOh, you don\u2019t know all of them.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Was that...suggestive?</p><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p> <p>As Brandt tossed and turned on the couch, he replayed every second of their interaction. Twice. At the end of the third dissection, he\u2019d determined Jessie probably wouldn\u2019t rebuff his sexual advances this time.</p><p>While that possibility caused a gnawing feeling of anticipation in his gut and made his dick stir with interest, it also served as a warning. He\u2019d have to wait for Jessie to approach him about making a change in their relationship. Not because he intended to punish her for turning him down previously, nor did he want her to beg, but he had to be one hundred percent certain it was a change she initiated\u2014not a change she was reacting to if he suggested they become lovers.</p><p>It\u2019d be hard as hell to wait. But he would, because he knew taking that next step, a permanent one in his mind, would definitely be worth the wait.</p><p>\u201cI think your best option is just to walk up to him, stark naked and say, Ride me, cowboy hottie.\u201d</p><p>Jessie glanced up from tying a bag of garbage. \u201cYou cannot be serious, Simone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s direct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little too direct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend, ain\u2019t no man gonna turn and run when faced with a sexy, naked, willing woman such as yourself. Trust me on this.\u201d</p> <p>Problem was, Jessie had seen a man turn and run when faced with her naked, willing self. Well, in Mike\u2019s case it was more like he fell down and passed out, but still, it\u2019d happened.</p><p>\u201cTrust Simone on what, Jessie?\u201d Skylar asked.</p><p>Crap. She blushed. \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d</p><p>Simone harrumphed and said, \u201cLater,\u201d leaving her alone with Skylar.</p><p>Thanks, Simone.</p><p>Jessie spent an extra long time securing a knot in the plastic garbage bag, hoping Skylar would leave.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession to make,\u201d Skylar said, moving in closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overheard your conversation with Simone.\u201d</p><p>Jessie looked at her boss. \u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ride me, cowboy hottie part. I\u2019m assuming she meant Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d Liar.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not planning on riding him into your bed?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t blush. \u201cI am. It\u2019s just...\u201d A whole new possibility to me and I\u2019m flustered with you grilling me about my plans. \u201cI imagine you want to talk me out of it.\u201d</p><p>Skylar shook her head. \u201cExactly the opposite.\u201d</p><p>Jessie wasn\u2019t expecting that.</p><p>\u201cLook, although our situations aren\u2019t similar, in some ways they are. I sprang a surprise baby on Kade. He moved in to help me take care of her. I insisted we just be friends and parenting partners, nothing else, meaning absolutely no way, no how, was I having sex with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did that last?\u201d</p><p>Skylar smirked. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen my husband. So, oh, about two weeks before we were getting naked together at every opportunity. I hope this isn\u2019t too much information, but I wanted to let you know, I\u2019ve been exactly where you are. And I almost let the best thing that ever happened to me get away because I was afraid to take a chance.\u201d</p><p>Kade and Skylar had a nauseatingly perfect marriage, so Jessie doubted the truth to that statement.</p><p>\u201cLike you, I had past relationship issues to work through. Like Brandt, Kade had family issues to work through. I wasn\u2019t sure if Kade wanted me, or if he only cared about me because of Eliza.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So that did sound a little familiar.</p><p>\u201cThe point I\u2019m trying to make? Brandt is a great guy. He\u2019s crazy about you. I know you\u2019re crazy about him, too, and well, it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world if you two got to know each other on a whole new level, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But this...situation with Landon isn\u2019t permanent. I don\u2019t want it to be permanent. But Brandt wouldn\u2019t mind if it was. So can I start something with him knowing I\u2019ll have to walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe better question is: how can you be willing to walk away from him now and not be willing to take a chance that you might never have to walk away from him?\u201d</p><p>For the psychoanalytical slant she used to make her statement, Skylar could\u2019ve just said, you\u2019ll never know unless you try. Jessie smiled. \u201cThanks, Skylar. I appreciate your candor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d At the door, she turned. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth? Simone was dead on. Getting naked always works.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cLandon is down for the count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Brandt muttered. \u201cYou have the magic touch. I swear the kid looked like he\u2019d punch me in the face if I so much as touched him.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a little young to start brawling. But he is a McKay, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d</p><p>Brandt took another pull off his beer and gestured to the couch. \u201cSit down and take a load off.\u201d</p><p>Jessie paced to the door, peering out the window, cursing her nervous energy. Hah. Who was she trying to kid? She was just plain nervous. This seemed like such an easy idea in the truck on the way home from work. Get naked. But it was two hours later and she still had her clothes on.</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t un-stick her tongue from the roof of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cJess? You know you can tell me anything,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>Yeah, just spit it out. You turned him down once. What\u2019s to say he won\u2019t do the same to you...just to even the score?</p><p>She closed her eyes, trying to slam the door on the self-sabotaging portion of her brain. \u201cThis...the way we\u2019ve got this set up isn\u2019t working for me any longer.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled a frustrated burst of air. \u201cOkay. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both are. That said, I can probably pick Landon up earlier and take him back here until after you get off work so it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Landon. It\u2019s about...us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, us. Living in the same space. Sharing everything.\u201d</p><p>Another one of his thoughtful pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to keep to myself and not cause you extra stress.\u201d</p><p>Jessie whirled to face him. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s not working, Brandt. I am stressed and it\u2019s because you\u2019re everywhere. In every part of my life. In every part of my house. We eat together. We do chores together.</p><p>We take care of Landon together. We watch TV together. You\u2019re the first person I see when I get up in the morning and you\u2019re the last person I see before I go to bed at night. We\u2019re acting like a married couple.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his jaw rippled and he gritted out, \u201cAnd that bothers you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dammit, because we\u2019re doing all the hard day-to-day couple stuff without the benefit of the good couple stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sleeping together. And if we\u2019re gonna act like a married couple then I want you naked in my bed every night.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s mouth dropped open so fast Jessie swore she heard his jawbone crack. Then his eyes tapered to fine points and his entire posture changed. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want an exact moment? How about last night when you gave me a backrub? I wanted you to stay with me all night and rub more than just my back. I know you\u2019re probably thinking I\u2019m crazy since I freaked out last year when you told me you wanted more than friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? Me.\u201d Jessie briefly closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not as emotionally raw as I was even four months ago. I\u2019ve also realized I don\u2019t want to spend my life unwilling to take a chance because I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment flickered on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scare me physically. There\u2019s an intensity to you that is intimidating as hell. There are no half measures in your world, Brandt. It\u2019s all or nothing. Being with a man like you would be unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d</p><p>That muscle in his jaw continued to jump in an agitated manner. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>Now that she was floundering, she realized getting naked in body was a helluva lot easier than stripping herself emotionally bare in front of him.</p><p>\u201cJessie. Answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured it out last summer when you warned me about Mike, but you didn\u2019t pull that highhanded McKay attitude and drag me out of there. Even though that situation ended in my humiliation, the way you forced me to accept the consequences of my rash decision proved you weren\u2019t the gentleman I thought you were. But you didn\u2019t leave. I know you wanted to finish what Mike couldn\u2019t. But I was too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShitfaced?\u201d he supplied with a soft snarl.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was too mortified you\u2019d witnessed yet another man who found me as sexually lacking as my husband had,\u201d she said without flinching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Brandt flinched. \u201cJessie that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue? Yes, it is. Yet, I know you would\u2019ve tossed me a pity fuck if I\u2019d asked.\u201d</p><p>That shocked him. But he recovered quickly. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not sure of anything. Except I can\u2019t get you out of my head since you\u2019ve moved in. All that mundane household shit that oughta be boring and I hated doing by myself? I look forward to doing it with you. Even when you\u2019re driving me crazy with lust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy with lust?\u201d His dark eyebrows winged up. \u201cThat\u2019s a stretch, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His skepticism might\u2019ve sent old Jessie scurrying to her room to hide. But new Jessie soldiered on.</p><p>\u201cEvery night after you get out of the shower and the scent of your shaving cream drifts out of the bathroom I fantasize about you rubbing your face and that scent over every inch of my skin.\u201d</p><p>Surprise and something else like...desire flashed in his eyes, which spurred her to keep going.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re talking to me? I\u2019m so busy staring at your mouth, imagining your kiss that I don\u2019t hear a single word you say.\u201d</p><p>With that, his surprise changed to recognition. So Brandt had noticed her attention to his lips whenever they were within kissing distance.</p><p>\u201cBut know what really twists me into knots? Seeing the way you look at me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you no longer see me as sweet, innocent Jessie. That if you ever got those big hands of yours on me, the last thing you\u2019d be with me...is sweet. You\u2019d get a thrill pushing past my boundaries, the ones I had before Luke and the ones I\u2019ve erected since Luke. You\u2019d derive great pleasure in showing me facets of sexual intimacy that I\u2019ve been denied\u2014or denied myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFancy talk.\u201d Brandt cocked his head, as if he was trying to study her from a new angle. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, you\u2019ve got me pegged better than I ever thought you would. With one exception.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we set this in motion, I\u2019ll demand more than just physical intimacy from you. It ain\u2019t only gonna be about scratching an itch, Jess, because I can get that any time I want.\u201d</p><p>How had Brandt picked up on her plan to prove to herself that she could experience sex without the pesky emotional ties?</p><p>Because he knows you better than you\u2019ve ever given him credit for.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll expect a different kind of intimacy than what we\u2019ve had in the past. A connection between us that has nothin\u2019 to do with Luke.\u201d</p><p>She looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice thought, but this connection has everything to do with Luke and there\u2019s no way we can ever get around that. Besides, you brought Landon into my life, Brandt, and he\u2019s connected to Luke. We wouldn\u2019t be in this situation if not for him. And maybe Landon\u2019s presence has forced us to deal with this-\u201d</p> <p>she gestured to the space between them, \u201c\u2014so I\u2019m done denying the pull is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this \u2018pull\u2019 something you recently realized? A proximity thing? I\u2019m a man, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m good enough to fuck for a few months?\u201d</p><p>Jessie twisted her fingers together. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that and you know it. After you made that pass at me, I convinced myself you were exactly like Luke\u2014biding your time until your charm earned an invitation into my bed. You\u2019d get your fill of me, work me out of your system and move on. And no, you can\u2019t fault me for that mindset, because of my limited experience with men, and my experience with Luke in particular. Plus, I wasn\u2019t so sure you wouldn\u2019t be using me to settle a score with Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think that lowly of me?\u201d he bit off.</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019m a clich\u00e9d horny widow desperate to screw the first man who smiles at me?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to bank the anger in her eyes when she met his glare head on. \u201cIf that was true, I wouldn\u2019t have waited two goddamn years, would I? I wouldn\u2019t be asking you to touch me, would I? I could\u2019ve found another man to scratch that itch in the four months since we last saw each other. But I didn\u2019t. Something held me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, nice sentiment, but spell it out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want no-strings sex for these four months we\u2019re together. At the end of those four months, we\u2019ll walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>Be strong, be confident. \u201cCan\u2019t we try it and see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we tell people? Because you know my family, they\u2019re gonna ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are living together, even if it\u2019s temporarily. People are already gonna assume we\u2019re sleeping together, especially in the gossipy McKay family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if Skylar comes right out and asks you if you\u2019re with me? Will you tell her that we\u2019re just fuck buddies?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t confess that Skylar encouraged her to get naked with him. \u201cWhat would you rather I told her? That we\u2019re attracted to each other, but we\u2019re keeping our hands off each other because it\u2019d be like Luke was in bed with us?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d struck a nerve with that. She hadn\u2019t meant to but there was no sense in apologizing now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop acting like him,\u201d she snapped. \u201cQuit trying to tell me what I\u2019m feeling is wrong. I\u2019m being completely honest with you. I\u2019m telling you this because I realized if we start this, I\u2019d own my sexuality for the first time in my life. I want that. With you. Starting tonight.\u201d Jessie took a breath, figuring she\u2019d said enough. Too much probably.</p><p>He studied her more intently than she was used to. With an edgy stillness that seemed totally foreign to him.</p><p>The longer she stood before him, the more her paranoia built.</p><p>Finally, Brandt pushed to his feet. His dark eyes remained on hers as he deftly skirted the coffee table and the pile of Landon\u2019s toys. He stopped in front of her, his big hands clenched at his sides. \u201cStarting tonight, but especially this first time, I call the shots. All of them. I own your sexuality. We clear?\u201d</p><p>Talk about being the big, bad wolf. Jessie nodded.</p><p>\u201cSay the word so there\u2019s no misunderstanding between us.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Brandt slanted his mouth over hers. But he didn\u2019t kiss her with lust-fueled passion. He drank her in\u2014</p><p>with his eyes, with the short, choppy breaths he pulled into his lungs.</p><p>Although Jessie was pretty sure he wanted to take a possessive kiss, he didn\u2019t, which indicated his monumental control.</p><p>His tongue darted out and slid along the plump inside curve of her bottom lip. A leisurely, sensuous glide across the sensitive flesh that caused her mouth to tremble even as her lips parted in invitation. But he didn\u2019t dive in for a greedy, openmouthed kiss. He lightly swept his damp lips over hers. Repeatedly. Male hunger and hot breath, tempered with softness that was unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>He gauged her responses and inched closer, but didn\u2019t allow their bodies to touch. Heat shimmered between them.</p><p>Jessie actually felt dizzy from want. What would he do if she fisted her hands in his T-shirt and just took the kiss she craved? His warning, This first time, I call the shots, forced her to truly surrender to him.</p><p>And that\u2019s when Brandt kissed her.</p><p>Holy mother of God did the man lay a kiss on her. His hands framed her face with utmost gentleness as his mouth conquered hers. Dominated. Destroyed. Ignited.</p><p>After several minutes of proving his mastery, Brandt changed the angle of his head, taking the kiss from fiery to flirty. Sucking on her tongue. Nibbling on the very edges of her lips. Kissing the corners of her smile.</p><p>\u201cJessie?\u201d he murmured between kisses. \u201cCan you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>Her head buzzed. She had no idea how her body remained upright when he\u2019d turned her inside out.</p><p>\u201cJess? Darlin\u2019? Are you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d His hands dropped from her face and he took her arm.</p><p>She thought he was taking her to bed, but he detoured to the couch. She blinked at him. \u201cWhat are we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to it.\u201d Brandt curled his hand around her jaw, feathering his thumb across her kiss swollen lower lip. \u201cTake your clothes off.\u201d Her eyes must\u2019ve given away her confusion because he clarified, \u201cI don\u2019t need a striptease. I need you nekkid.\u201d</p><p>With shaking fingers, Jessie gripped the edges of her mock turtleneck and tugged it over her head.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her naked before, but her whole body flushed with color anyway.</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t help with her clothing removal, besides the heat in his eyes urging her to hurry.</p><p>Next she unhooked her bra, tossing it on the floor. She yanked to release the button on her jeans.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s hand shot out and held her shoulder as she shimmied the denim down her legs. She\u2019d hooked a finger in each side of her black lace panties, when Brandt\u2019s rough hand covered hers, forcing her to look at him.</p><p>\u201cThose are mine.\u201d He gently pushed her onto the couch.</p><p>The tweed fabric scratched her skin. Weird to think she\u2019d never sat naked on this couch before now.</p><p>Leather probably would\u2019ve been a better furniture choice.</p><p>This is not the time to contemplate home furnishing mistakes. Look at Brandt, dummy, not the weaving pattern in the fabric.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinkin\u2019 about so hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot thinking about anything but you, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch pretty words from such a pretty mouth.\u201d He used the tip of his finger to trace the contours of her lips. \u201cDo you have any idea how jealous I was that night at the lake? Seein\u2019 you on your knees in front of that little fucking prick, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much from that part of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and I wanna erase that mental image of you with another man\u2019s cock in your throat. All I want to remember is the image of my cock in your throat. Your mouth on my dick.\u201d Brandt unbuckled his belt and unzipped his jeans. Eased both to the floor without losing eye contact with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What a rush, seeing Brandt\u2019s take-charge side. In the last week she\u2019d been thinking a lot about the kind of lover he\u2019d be. And thank God sugarcoating his demands wasn\u2019t his style.</p><p>She barely got a peek at his cock before he commanded, \u201cHands on my thighs.\u201d He grasped the base of his dick in his right hand and rubbed his cockhead across her lips. \u201cOpen.\u201d</p><p>Jessie let her eyes drift shut in anticipation of tasting him, of pleasing him, of pleasing herself by admitting how much she wanted this, wanted him.</p><p>His gentleness during the slow glide across her lips, over her teeth and across her tongue, surprised her. As did the loving way he framed her face in his hands, sweeping his thumbs over her hollowed cheeks up to her temple. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>The musky, salty, utterly masculine flavor filled her mouth and zoomed straight to her core.</p><p>His gentleness vanished without warning. He held her head tightly, angled her neck and rammed in fully so the base of his cock rested on her bottom teeth.</p><p>She opened her throat against her immediate reaction to gag. She relaxed her jaw and sucked air in through her nose. The circumference of his dick was thick enough that her lips were stretched to the limit.</p><p>But man, she loved this. Giving in to him. Giving it all to him.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>The only things she could move were her eyes. The satisfaction in Brandt\u2019s caused her heart to jackhammer. Caused her pulse to pound between her thighs. In that moment, she knew there was no going back. Anything that happened between them would be so much more than sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna want you usin\u2019 that mouth more. Swallow.\u201d</p><p>She did, but it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He withdrew, leaving just the head balanced on the edge of her teeth. \u201cUse your tongue.</p><p>Good. Oh, yeah, I like that.\u201d Then he flexed his hips and buried his length into her throat again, starting the rapid in and out thrusting that told her he was already close to the edge.</p><p>Mired in a sexual haze, Jessie listened to his play by play of what he wanted. Of how hot she looked.</p><p>How sexy she was. How much he\u2019d wanted her. She lost herself in the deep cadence of his voice. In the heat of his cock driving into the wetness of her mouth. In the feeling of connectedness to him. In his tenacity.</p><p>He swore and stopped halfway in her mouth, until the tip rested on the back of her tongue. He said,</p><p>\u201cSuck. Jesus. Suck hard. Fuck.\u201d He grunted and hot semen burst against her soft palette.</p><p>She sucked and swallowed, tightening the seal on his spasming cock. Wanting to blow his mind.</p><p>Wanting to keep this bond as long as he allowed. Those big, wonderful hands went from gripping her head to tenderly caressing her hair to tapping her jaw so he could slide his spent cock free from her mouth.</p><p>Before he could get too far away or say anything, Jessie grabbed his butt. She pressed kisses to his left thigh, moving up to kiss his hipbone and over to rub her mouth across the trail of dark hair that started between his pectorals and ended right there. He twisted her hair between his fingers as she nuzzled this sexy part of him.</p><p>\u201cJess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He smelled so good in this spot. She nuzzled again.</p><p>\u201cEnough. Baby. You\u2019re killin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>She froze mid-kiss, not daring to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it. But it\u2019s my turn now.\u201d He stepped back.</p><p>Jessie glanced up just as Brandt dropped to his knees. Oh man. He wasn\u2019t looking at her face. At all.</p><p>A delicious curl of heat ebbed through her.</p><p>His hands circled her hips. He slid the lower half of her body off the couch cushion, practically ripping off her panties, uttering a terse, \u201cBrace yourself.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled to lock her arms when Brandt\u2019s rough-tipped fingers scraped the top of her thighs as he spread her knees apart.</p><p>A half snarl left his throat. He snagged an extra pillow and tapped her butt in a signal for her to raise her hips. The soft velvety fabric brushed her bare ass. Ooh. That felt nice.</p><p>But not as nice as Brandt\u2019s soft, velvety tongue brushing her sex from bottom to top.</p><p>She gasped when he did it again. And again. And again.</p><p>His fingers opened her pussy completely, baring every wet inch, allowing Brandt to taste every wet inch. Thoroughly. Burrowing his tongue into her channel, retreating to delicately lick her folds. Using his mouth in ways that caused her body to twitch and tingle. In ways that had her making noises she\u2019d never heard before.</p><p>No play by play this time. Brandt\u2019s mouth was too busy driving her higher and higher until she feared she\u2019d combust.</p><p>Almost embarrassing how short her fuse was. The zip down her spine of impending pleasure was a brief warning\u2014a microsecond later, she exploded. Imploded. Went sailing headlong into bliss. She arched back and gasped. Her legs shook. Her arms shook. Her internal organs shook.</p><p>This man had the power to shake her to her very core.</p><p>After the trembling stopped, she peered down at him, expecting he\u2019d be gazing at her with a cocky grin, because oh, yeah, he\u2019d rocked her world. But Brandt\u2019s dark head was pressed into her lower belly as he fought to level his breathing.</p><p>She smoothed her hands over the short hair on his scalp. The stubble on his head felt as funky and cool beneath her palms as it did between her thighs. Just touching him reinforced her feeling of rightness.</p><p>Of the sense of security and trust he gave her. Yet, he made her feel like a hot-bodied porn star. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be askin\u2019 you that,\u201d he muttered against her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excellent. That was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he pushed away from her and rolled to his feet. \u201cAh. I need to get something.\u201d He yanked his duster on over his naked body, shoved his feet into his over boots and booked it out the door.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Panic seized her. Had she done something wrong? Why had he just up and left?</p><p>They always leave you. Haven\u2019t you learned that by now?</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening. Jessie was trying to process Brandt\u2019s retreat when the door slammed. A muffled thump echoed to her as boots hit the carpet.</p><p>Then he stood in front of her. \u201cJess? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she tore her gaze from her feet. \u201cI thought you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! No way. I said I\u2019d be right back, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He crouched down and tilted her chin up. \u201cI\u2019d never do that to you. Never up and leave you. And it has nothin\u2019 to do with you sitting here nekkid.\u201d</p><p>He brought her mouth to his for a prolonged kiss that soothed as well as aroused. If he could read her so perfectly now, what would it be like after they really got to know each other intimately?</p><p>Paradise.</p><p>\u201cSo you tired?\u201d he asked in a husky tone that dripped with bedroom prowess.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He tugged her to her feet, stalking her with another show of masculine grace, backing her down the hallway with such raw possession she could scarcely breathe. No man had ever looked at her like that.</p><p>After he shut the bedroom door, she said, \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p><p>Brandt shucked off his coat. He tossed a box of condoms and an unopened tube of lube on the bed.</p><p>\u201cKept them in my truck. Just in case.\u201d He offered her a shy smile. \u201cI never assumed anything, just wanted you to know that.\u201d</p><p>No, like a true gentleman he wouldn\u2019t assume, but like a true boy scout he was prepared. Another little shiver of desire rippled through her. \u201cOh. Well, we don\u2019t have to use the condoms, if you\u2019d rather skip it. I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? When you haven\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeps my cycle regular. But if you\u2019re used to using them, then that\u2019s okay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo condoms.\u201d He slowly dragged his hungry gaze over her body with a terse, \u201cOn the bed on your hands and knees.\u201d</p><p>When Jessie hesitated, Brandt made the warning growl that meant there was no room for argument.</p><p>Okay, the big, bad wolf was back. She faced the headboard. The mattress dipped as Brandt joined her.</p><p>She flinched when his big hands circled her ankles and widened her stance.</p><p>Brandt stilled behind her. \u201cJess? Am I scaring you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you flinch when I touched you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprised me.\u201d</p><p>He draped his body over hers\u2014his chest to her back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is November and I was just running outside nekkid.\u201d He brushed aside her hair and kissed the back of her neck.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the kind of shiver I like,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI want you. You ready or do I need lube?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Brandt answered by sliding into her slowly to the hilt. He continued to pepper warm, soft kisses across the slope of her shoulder.</p><p>She savored the sensation. Nothing in the world compared to this heat and fullness and connection.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you kiss me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could spend hours kissing every inch of your skin. Next time, I will.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and looked at him when she noticed his body vibrated. \u201cAre you still cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you shaking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m tryin\u2019 not to rut on you. I\u2019m not feelin\u2019 real...gentlemanly, if you wanna know the truth.\u201d His lips tickled her ear. \u201cI know this is our first time but it doesn\u2019t change my body wantin\u2019 to fuck you hard.\u201d</p><p>That admission caused a gush of moisture to flood her sex. She moaned.</p><p>He sucked in a swift breath. \u201cThe thought of me fucking you hard makes you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you\u2019ve done to me so far makes me wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReach your arms above your head.\u201d</p><p>Jessie pressed the side of her face into the mattress as she gripped the rungs on the headboard.</p><p>\u201cLook at you, so goddamn sexy stretched out like that.\u201d His calluses scraped her skin as he swept his hands down the length of her back to circle her hips. He pulled out and slammed back in quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hissed, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>In this position, every time he thrust, the flannel sheet abraded her nipples. The simple eroticism of Brandt\u2019s sure and steady movements as his cock tunneled in and out of her pussy forced a whimpering sigh from her lungs.</p><p>\u201cSo tight. God that\u2019s good. Not gonna last.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, allowing the sensations to wash over her, sensations exclusive to sex; the rhythmic squeak of the bed, harsh male breathing on her back, rough-skinned hands gripping her hips, the heat, wetness, the sounds of their body parts meeting, the friction of the sheets on her knees, elbows and nipples.</p><p>But it was more than that. And she couldn\u2019t find the right words to explain it because the push and pull lulled her to a floaty plane where need and satisfaction were in perfect balance.</p><p>He plunged faster, muttering, jarring Jessie from her fog of pleasure. As soon as she felt his cock jerking against her inner walls, she bore down on his shaft, earning a holy fuck and then another groan.</p><p>Followed by another louder holy fuck and another longer groan.</p><p>Then his stillness.</p><p>Between panting breaths, he said, \u201cJess. I know...you didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Brandt pulled out and flipped her onto her back, imprisoning her arms above her head. He sealed his lips to hers, as he slid his length of his shaft along her cleft, rubbing the rim of his cockhead directly on her clit.</p><p>Oh. Wow. This was something new for her, but Brandt knew exactly what he was doing. He skipped the gradual buildup, going straight for the high point. With his relentless attention, she ripped her mouth free from his, unable to breathe or gasp or even whimper as the orgasm pulsed in short, intense bursts and he rode every wave of it with her.</p><p>After her brain clicked back on, she peeked at Brandt. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get very used to watching you come.\u201d He kissed her. Sweetly, tenderly, but with the hunger that let her know he wasn\u2019t done with her. \u201cRegrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a single one.\u201d She twisted her wrists as a hint for him to release her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pushed up. \u201cAre you sore?\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cNo,\u201d a little too quickly.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDammit, if I was too rough on you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve said something. I\u2019m not fragile, Brandt, remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d say that even if you were bleeding, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes it surprised her how well he knew her.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d he said rolling off the bed. \u201cYou need anything before we go for the round two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRound two?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. Because we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Brandt gulped two glasses of water in the kitchen and took a minute to grasp the situation.</p><p>Holy hell, he\u2019d just had sex with Jessie.</p><p>Jessie.</p><p>It boggled his mind.</p><p>Not only that, she\u2019d initiated sex.</p><p>Not only that, she hadn\u2019t wanted gentle lovemaking\u2014she wanted to be fucked. Hard.</p><p>Not only that, she hadn\u2019t balked when he\u2019d called her on her bravado, pushing her to put her money where her mouth was.</p><p>Holy hell, talk about a mouth that could own him body and soul. How he\u2019d managed to hold out for more than fifteen seconds when those soft, warm lips circled the base of his cock while she sucked his shaft also boggled his mind.</p><p>How he\u2019d managed to keep his cool when he got his first taste of her pussy was another miracle.</p><p>Because damn, she\u2019d been so wet that he could\u2019ve stayed buried between her thighs, licking away that sweet juice, feeling her come against his mouth, all damn night.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s mental play by play fired his blood and he knew he\u2019d have Jessie at least one more time tonight. Maybe in straight missionary position.</p><p>Boring. Don\u2019t you want to blow her circuits with your sexpertise? Show her every position you\u2019ve ever tried and some you\u2019ve only seen in porn?</p><p>Hell yeah. No. Hell no. That cocky attitude made him sound like...Luke, actually. He never wanted the comparison, especially not from Jessie. Not ever.</p><p>He could admit he\u2019d taken her from behind for their first time because he worried she might whisper Luke\u2019s name in his ear during a moment of passion. Maybe he feared he\u2019d see regret or sadness in her eyes.</p><p>But he\u2019d pushed aside those worries when the primitive side of his brain seized control and he flipped her on her back, just to see the look on her face when he made her come.</p><p>A look he couldn\u2019t wait to see again.</p><p>He refilled the water glass and he walked to the bedroom. For some reason his heart sped up and he lingered in the doorway. Had he left her alone too long? What if she\u2019d fallen asleep?</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>He found her resting on against pillows propped against the headboard with the comforter tucked beneath her armpits. \u201cYou want a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She drank half before handing the glass back. \u201cDid you check on Landon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He set the glass on the dresser. \u201cI thought I might wake him up and he\u2019s not included in the plans I have for you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on if you think we need to talk about anything that just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done enough talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Let\u2019s go to plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easier to show you.\u201d Brandt ripped back the covers and crawled over her body, until he was hanging directly above her. He whipped aside the pillows so she laid flat on the mattress. He angled his head over hers, seeing her eyes spark interest and heat as his lips closed the distance between their mouths.</p><p>Jessie released a soft moan, which reverberated in his mouth as he kissed her. Her lips were warm and eager. Her tongue as curious to explore as his was. They kissed, drawing out the pleasure by switching between hungry openmouthed kisses, sweet nibbles, teasing nips and soft smooches.</p><p>Brandt gazed down at her.</p><p>She caressed the side of his face. \u201cMan, I could kiss you for days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can arrange that. But first...\u201d Brandt let his hands skim over her skin. \u201cI want to touch you.</p><p>Everywhere. It might take a while, because I\u2019ve been living for the day I got to put my hands all over you.\u201d</p><p>He stretched out, propping his head on his left hand, figuring it\u2019d take twice as long to acquaint himself with her body if he limited himself to one hand.</p><p>\u201cYou still trying to figure out all my ticklish spots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanna figure out which spots make you squirm and which ones make you moan.\u201d He let the rough tips of his fingers follow the line of her delicate neck down to the base of her throat. Then his thumb swept across her collarbone to her shoulder. Her skin was pale, he\u2019d expected to see more freckles or moles, but it was just a silky smooth expanse of white.</p><p>His palm cupped the ball of her shoulder, traveling down to squeeze her firm biceps. He traced the bend in her elbow, first with his fingers, then with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cOh, I...wow. That feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTastes good too.\u201d Brandt\u2019s fingers drifted down the inside of her forearm to her wrist. He threaded his fingers through hers and brought their joined hands to his mouth, lightly kissing each fingertip. He reversed course back up her arms and did the same thing, bestowing the same diligent treatment to the other side, except he dragged it out a little more.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s body wilted when he skimmed his fingers up and down her side, in a feather-light caress, from her armpit to the curve of her hip. She managed not to squirm too wildly when he wrapped her fingers on the rungs of the headboard and zigzagged openmouthed kisses down that same tender section of skin.</p><p>Twice.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell rapidly with the marked increase in her breathing. His cock was so hard it pained him to bend over as he moved down the wonders of her body, but Brandt would not be rushed. He\u2019d take his time, even if it damn near killed them both.</p><p>He paid no attention to her breasts or her nipples. Instead, his mouth brushed over every rib in her ribcage. Then down the centerline of her belly, past her belly button, to that sensitive span of skin between her narrow hipbones. When he put his mouth on her there, her entire belly rippled. So he did it over and over until she huffed out an impatient breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemorizing you.\u201d He pressed kisses around the triangle of strawberry blonde hair at the juncture of her thighs. Again he allowed his fingers to map the muscles in her legs, tease the skin on the inside and smooth his palm over the curve from hip to ankle.</p><p>He kissed the tops of her thighs. He lifted her leg to nuzzle the back of her thighs and to trace the bend in her knees with his tongue. He peppered kisses down her shinbones, which were covered in bruises from Landon smacking into her all the time. When he reached the top of her foot, he sucked at the delicate skin and Jessie shot up off the bed so fast she almost kicked him in the face. \u201cEasy there,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI heard that toe sucking was erotic, but this...this is way better. I never knew that would make me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTingle. My God. My whole body is tingling.\u201d</p><p>He switched feet just to see her come unglued.</p><p>\u201cOkay, and now in addition to making me tingle, you\u2019re making me wet. Really wet. In fact, I think you should check it out,\u201d she purred.</p><p>Brandt chuckled. \u201cI believe you. But I\u2019m not finished yet.\u201d The same time he lifted her right ankle for a kiss, he noticed the tattoo. He outlined the shape of the butterfly with the pad of his thumb. \u201cWhen did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time a bunch of us went in and India gave us all McKay brands.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard about his cousin\u2019s wives getting inked with the McKay cattle brand, but he\u2019d never seen Jessie\u2019s. He\u2019d been too busy noticing other parts of her body.</p><p>\u201cBut last year, about the time I...quit grieving for Luke so hard and realized our life wasn\u2019t as perfect as I\u2019d made it out to be after he was gone, I wanted the symbol of his ownership gone too. So India designed this one, using the original tat, but you\u2019d have to look really hard to see it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The colorful butterfly emerging from a land cocoon fit Jessie\u2019s personal metamorphosis. Yet, it bothered him that she\u2019d had the McKay brand removed. Why not just get a new tattoo? Keep the old one as a reminder of a past life event? If he thought about it too hard, he might take offense to it. Like Jessie no longer wanted to be associated with the McKays. Like she wanted to erase any part of her life with them.</p><p>If that\u2019s true, why did she keep the McKay name?</p><p>\u201cBrandt? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019.\u201d He met her gaze and managed to smile before he placed a tender kiss on her tattoo. \u201cBut since I\u2019m down by your feet, that means I\u2019m all done exploring. Unless you can think of a spot or two I missed.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to remind him he hadn\u2019t touched her nipples, and she didn\u2019t disappoint him.</p><p>Jessie released the headboard to cup her breasts. \u201cPut your mouth on me here.\u201d</p><p>Brandt centered himself between her thighs and lowered his mouth to her left nipple. The peach colored tip was already hard so he began to draw circles around the quivering flesh on her chest with his fingers and his tongue. If he thought she squirmed before, it was nothing compared to how she reacted when he lavished attention on her breasts. Every part. From the nipples to the upper curve to the lower swell. He could stroke gently or pinch the tips with a little force, or nuzzle or softly suckle and she whimpered, moaned and thrashed.</p><p>Okay. Loved nipple play. Check.</p><p>He scattered kisses up her neck, stopping at her mouth. He kissed the corner of her smile, nipping and licking the seam until she parted her lips. He dove in for a blistering kiss, feeling her hands moving all over him, on his lower back, pressing down as she tried to connect their hips.</p><p>He buried his lips in her hair above her ear. \u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is another warning to be patient...you oughta know I almost came just from you sucking my nipples. When you went down on me? Just thinking about it now still makes my entire groin throb.\u201d</p><p>Brandt smiled against her temple. \u201cThrob, huh? So, does that mean you don\u2019t want to show me this super vibrator of yours that can get you off a dozen times a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m thinking of throwing it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you got me off a dozen times a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to know I\u2019m a step up from a vibrator,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ten stories above a vibrator and you know it.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou have a mouth made for sex.</p><p>When you kiss me it\u2019s like my brain goes on overload.\u201d</p><p>He levered himself over her, watching as her eyes went dark with anticipation. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you oughta know about me, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a sexual man. I\u2019ll push you, but the biggest thing you\u2019ll need to get used to with me is that I like sex. I like a lot of sex. Once we start this, there\u2019s no backing down. No changing your mind. I will want you morning, noon and night, because you\u2019ve proven you\u2019ve got a pretty magical mouth yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on, cowboy. I\u2019ll have no problem keeping up with your demands. But if you expect I\u2019m gonna be a passive lover, think again.\u201d</p><p>Her cocksure reply made his dick jump against his belly. \u201cBring it on, cowgirl.\u201d</p><p>And Brandt continued to focus on her face as he slipped inside her inch by inch.</p><p>Jessie wrapped her feet around the inside of his ankles, holding him in place. Soon as her hands landed on his ass, she arched, driving him deeper.</p><p>The slow, steady, easy strokes didn\u2019t stay that way for long. She urged him on by canting her pelvis, moaning yes, yes. Brandt forced himself to keep the same pace as he greedily watched Jessie unravel. She held him still with a nail digging grip on his ass as her pussy spasmed around his shaft.</p><p>As soon as she went limp, his hips pistoned harder, faster. His entire body seemed to boil\u2014blood, skin, balls and bones\u2014when his seed shot out of his dick in a hot wash of pleasure. An eye crossing, leg cramping, sweat pouring, primal grunting, he\u2019d found heaven kind of ecstasy.</p><p>When he found his way back to reality, he realized this was true heaven. Not the outstanding orgasm, but seeing Jessie\u2019s soft smile. Feeling her soft, sated body beneath his. Having her here, with him. Where she belonged. Because his beautiful, sweet Jessie was his perfect match in every way.</p><p>How long before she realized it?</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Sorry.\u201d He smiled a bit sheepishly. \u201cZoned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d She rubbed circles on his lower back that sent another wave of tingles dancing up his spine. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Got some sexy love talk going on there.</p><p>Spent, emotionally and physically, he rolled onto his back.</p><p>Immediately Jessie snuggled into him so thoroughly she was practically on top of him.</p><p>\u201cComfy?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Very. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>No. I freakin\u2019 love it. \u201cNo. But do you, ah...need to go to the bathroom or shower or anything before we call it a night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I wanna fall asleep like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I like your scent all over me. I like feeling the stickiness between my thighs and remembering how it got there. Does that sound weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He brushed his lips over her crown. \u201cIt\u2019s hot as hell.\u201d The remnants of his seed would ease the way when he fucked her first thing in the morning.</p><p>\u201cI like having you in my bed.\u201d She kissed his pectoral. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the smokin\u2019 hot sex. But also for not being petty and turning me down. I would\u2019ve deserved your rejection for the way things have gone between us in the past.\u201d</p><p>Brandt forced her to look at him. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s where it can stay. In the past. We\u2019re movin\u2019 forward, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He pressed her cheek back down on his chest. \u201cGo to sleep. Mornin\u2019 is gonna come awful early.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cAlready got your wake-up call for me planned out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin the surprise? No way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Jessie and Landon were sitting side by side on the couch watching a Winnie the Pooh DVD when Brandt returned from the ranch. As soon as he\u2019d divested himself of his outerwear, he marched over and cradled Jessie\u2019s face in his hands.</p><p>The man nearly set her lips aflame with his hungry, and yet unhurried kiss. She tried to pull away, but he breathed, \u201cNot yet,\u201d against her mouth and returned to those deceptively lazy kisses. Then he eased back and murmured, \u201cNot nearly enough, but it\u2019ll do for now.\u201d</p><p>Right then, Jessie understood she wasn\u2019t prepared for what it meant to be Brandt McKay\u2019s lover.</p><p>Sure, he\u2019d tried to warn her last night about his sexual appetite. About his intent to satisfy that appetite as well as building the same type of appetite in her. Maybe she\u2019d even suspected his declaration was a little too filled with machismo. A little too over the top.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known better. She should\u2019ve understood after he\u2019d made love to her so thoroughly that last go around. She should\u2019ve understood when he\u2019d proved his desire for her first thing this morning.</p><p>Spooned behind her, lifting her top leg over his, fucking her slowly while one hand played with her nipples and the other controlled her clit, whispering in her ear with that made-for-morning-sex voice. She came so hard she\u2019d ripped the sheet off the bed.</p><p>\u201cJess? What\u2019s up? You\u2019ve got a scared rabbit look goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing this forceful side of you...is a bit of a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d He smooched her mouth again.</p><p>Landon made a noise and she saw him watching them with wide-eyed wonder.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, how\u2019s the ear? Better?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at Brandt and refocused on the TV.</p><p>Brandt laughed. \u201cThrown over by a cartoon bear. I\u2019m gonna hit the shower.\u201d</p><p>Less than a minute later the water kicked on.</p><p>Landon pointed at the TV and bounced on the couch cushions when Tigger appeared on the screen.</p><p>Animation and cartoons were new to him, if his total absorption in them was an indication. Jessie doubted Landon\u2019s mother used the TV as a babysitter.</p><p>Once she heard the bathroom door open, she headed down the hallway, inhaling the steam that held hints of Irish Spring soap and lime shaving cream.</p><p>She stopped in the doorway to her bedroom. Ooh. Naked Brandt. The man had such a hard-toned body. All ropy, bulging muscles and pure masculinity. Virility. Luke had been built more rangy than bulky and she\u2019d never appreciated the differences in the male form as much as she did right then.</p><p>\u201cGetting an eyeful, are you?\u201d</p><p>She let her gaze drop to his groin. \u201cDefinitely got more than a mouthful going on there, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Jessie,\u201d he sputtered, \u201cthat\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great idea?\u201d she supplied. \u201cOr shocking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, actually. And if Landon wasn\u2019t...\u201d He made a growling noise in his throat. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you.\u201d She watched Brandt slip on a pair of navy colored boxer briefs. Then a pair of faded Wranglers. \u201cLast weekend you took Landon back to your place. Are you sticking around this weekend now that things have changed?\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t miss a beat buttoning his flannel shirt. \u201cDo you want us to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can\u2019t imagine spending the weekend by myself.\u201d</p><p>Then he was in her face, kissing her almost before she finished the sentence.</p><p>She heard a thump in the living room. She broke the liplock to go check on Landon, and as she turned around, the little wild man smacked into her knees. \u201cYou afraid we\u2019re having fun without you or something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He tried to hoist himself up on the bed. Soon as she set him on the mattress, he started jumping in his best Tigger imitation.</p><p>\u201cYou little monkey. Where\u2019d you learn\u2014\u201d Jessie\u2019s head whipped to Brandt when he snickered. \u201cYou let him jump on the bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kids jump on the bed. Besides, I was there the whole time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens if you\u2019re not there? What happens if he sneaks into a bedroom and starts jumping while you\u2019re doing something else? What if he flies off the bed and breaks his neck?\u201d</p><p>Brandt snagged Landon around the waist and propped him on his hip, much to Landon\u2019s displeasure.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I get it. Bad uncle. No more jumpin\u2019 on the bed. And I\u2019ll make sure since I\u2019ve introduced this bad behavior that all bedrooms doors will be shut from here on out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d After they trooped back into the living room and Jessie said, \u201cI didn\u2019t plan anything for supper because I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to cook for me every night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like to cook. So do you have any requests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feelin\u2019 like pizza.\u201d</p><p>Jessie frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I don\u2019t have the stuff for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have frozen pizza in the freezer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go to the Pizza Barn in Moorcroft?\u201d Brandt suggested.</p> <p>After the last public appearance at Dewey\u2019s, fielding a dozen questions about Landon and why she was torturing herself caring for a child that wasn\u2019t hers... Nah. Not an experience she was anxious to repeat, especially not in front of Brandt with Landon tow.</p><p>\u201cYou not wantin\u2019 to be seen in public with me?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze caught his. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you, paranoid man. Just remembering the scream therapy I needed last time I ventured out to a restaurant. So I\u2019d rather stay in.\u201d</p><p>Tension left Brandt\u2019s posture and he smiled. \u201cHow about if I call in an order, pick it up and we eat it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan.\u201d</p><p>While Brandt was gone, Jessie fed Landon and bathed him. She dumped out the jumbo Legos on the coffee table and they sorted the pieces by color. Landon was fascinated by how the different sized parts fit and he was pleased as punch when he figured out how to snap them together by himself. Every day at the daycare and at home, she watched Landon learn something new. And rather than getting a sense of pride, it humbled her to see how hungry he was to learn.</p><p>Jessie ate the pizza one handed because Landon demanded she hold him while he drank his bottle.</p><p>Brandt returned from settling Landon in his crib with that get-nekkid look in his eye.</p> <p>Good thing she\u2019d taken the time to brush her teeth.</p><p>Tell and Dalton showed up at Jessie\u2019s around noon on Sunday. Luckily they\u2019d called first and hadn\u2019t walked in on him and Jess going at it in the shower.</p><p>Or on the couch.</p><p>Or on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Man. They could not get enough of each other. Within a few days they\u2019d become intimate on a level he\u2019d never experienced. As freakin\u2019 awesome as the sex was, Brandt knew it wasn\u2019t the only reason they\u2019d become so close. They\u2019d let their guards down and hadn\u2019t put those walls back up.</p><p>So far.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t announced that he and Jessie had become more to each other than Landon\u2019s guardians.</p><p>Would Jessie shy away the first time he showed affection in front of his brothers?</p><p>Nope. She\u2019d gone him one better and kissed him. With tongue.</p><p>She was a natural fit to their Sunday afternoon tradition\u2014flipping back and forth between football games and waiting for Chase to compete in a televised PBR event, knocking back a few beers. Even Landon refused to nap so he could hang out with his uncles.</p><p>But at suppertime Landon staged a crying, screaming tantrum. The thought of wrestling the crabby kid into the bathtub made him shudder, but he wouldn\u2019t pass the duty off to Jessie either. Somehow Tell and Dalton ended up bathing the ornery boy. The bath time screams Brandt expected were largely absent, replaced by giggles.</p><p>Giggles?</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>He poked his head in the bathroom door and saw Tell, on his knees in front of the tub, and Landon\u2014</p><p>with Dalton\u2019s help\u2014was spraying Tell in the face with the hand-held shower sprayer. Tell, being even keeled Tell, just let them do it and laughed right along with them.</p><p>His brothers managed to get Landon diapered and in his pajamas without incident.</p><p>Dalton held Landon while the kid sucked down his bottle. Once he\u2019d tucked the tyke in bed, Dalton and Tell asked if they could have Landon the following Saturday night. For the last of the McKay wild men to give up their weekend plans proved his brothers intended to be part of Landon\u2019s life.</p><p>Maybe it was a little selfish, but his first thought was that he\u2019d have Jessie all to himself for a night.</p><p>Jessie was washing dishes two days later when Keely barged into her house, demanding, \u201cWhat the hell? Luke had a kid? I hate when nobody tells me this kind of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Keely. Please. Why don\u2019t you come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoulda locked the door if you wanted to keep me out. As soon as I heard I had to come over here and see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout adding Luke\u2019s illegitimate love child to your roster of nieces and nephews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And wow, snippy much, Jess? I came to see if you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Keely snorted. \u201cYeah, and you\u2019re acting like it, lashing out at me for checking on your mental well being.\u201d</p><p>Jessie blew out a breath. \u201cSorry. The shock hasn\u2019t been easy, but I\u2019m coming to terms with it.\u201d</p><p>Which it, Jess? Luke\u2019s infidelity? Or Landon\u2019s presence?</p><p>Aren\u2019t they one in the same?</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Keely demanded. \u201cHave you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days, yes. Other days I wonder what the hell I\u2019m doing and who in the universe I pissed off to have to deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot freakin\u2019 believe Brandt expected you to help him. I cannot freakin\u2019 believe you said yes.\u201d</p><p>Keely paced to the kitchen and back. \u201cActually, I can believe you said yes.\u201d</p><p>Did Keely think she was a doormat? Only one way to find out. \u201cWhy can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re sweet, thoughtful, kind and generous.\u201d Keely pinned her with a look. \u201cDamn near annoyingly perfect in that nauseating girl-next-door way, to be honest, but I like you anyway, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut mostly, you said yes because Landon is as innocent in this whole situation as you are.\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s insight always surprised her. \u201cYou want a beer while I\u2019m spilling the gory details of lost innocence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Keely flopped on the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve got a late patient tonight so I have to head back to the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>Keely smirked. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>Jessie launched into recent events. Before she finished, Landon cried from his crib. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Landon had woken in a somber mood\u2014not all cute smiles and sweet snuggles. Not knowing how he\u2019d behave continued to be a struggle, so she hoped for the best and returned to the living room with Landon in her arms.</p><p>He shrank back as he spied Keely.</p><p>Keely\u2019s eyes sparked tears. \u201cOmigod. It\u2019s like he\u2019s a clone of Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose McKay genes are powerful stuff.\u201d Jessie grabbed Landon\u2019s cup from the fridge and a handful of animal crackers. He stayed on her lap with a wary eye on Keely.</p><p>\u201cSo you really do seem fine with all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my days where I\u2019d like to leave town with no forwarding address, believe me. But I agreed to do it so it seems pointless to complain. Plus, I know it\u2019s temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a possibility?\u201d Keely kicked her boots up on the coffee table. \u201cThat it might become permanent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me. Maybe for Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere does Brandt fall in all of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t just passed the responsibility of taking care of Landon off on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess. That\u2019s not what I meant. I meant personally. Brandt is living with you. You\u2019re together all the time, taking care of a child. I hope you\u2019re working out some of your past issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean working them out between the sheets, then yes,\u201d she said in a rush.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...it\u2019s intense. But, again, that\u2019s because this is a temporary situation.\u201d</p><p>Keely gave her a calculated look. Like she was ready to call bullshit.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t this be the start of something that will be intense for years to come?\u201d</p><p>Jessie couldn\u2019t answer that to anyone\u2019s satisfaction, so she sidestepped the question. She brushed crumbs off Landon\u2019s shirt. \u201cYou dated Jack\u2019s brother for awhile, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you and Jack haven\u2019t had any fights or discussions about the time you were with Justin?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had huge fights, which means no rational discussion. We don\u2019t talk about the sexual aspect of it. Jack knows more about what happened between Justin and me only because Justin told him, I never would have. But my relationship with Justin happened a few years before Jack and I stopped hating each other long enough to really look at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you weren\u2019t the source of fights between them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Realization dawned in Keely\u2019s eyes. \u201cDamn. You were, weren\u2019t you? The source of fights between Luke and Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone this, Keely, but I overheard them. I wanted to die of embarrassment. My husband didn\u2019t love me enough to stay faithful and he made sure my brother-in-law knew it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m in a different situation. It\u2019s complicated enough between me and Brandt without adding him\u2014\u201d she pointed at Landon, \u201c\u2014into the mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Landon\u2019s the glue that will allow you and Brandt to be together.\u201d</p> <p>Or maybe he\u2019s the wedge that will drive us apart.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s no secret that you and Brandt spent a lot of time together after Luke died. Everyone thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d just slip from one McKay bed to another without any problem whatsoever? God. Has everyone been listening to Casper talk about me?\u201d</p><p>Keely\u2019s boots hit the carpet. \u201cSee? That\u2019s your problem. You automatically assume everyone thinks the worst of you. Casper is the exception, not the rule. What I started to say was we all hoped you\u2019d both find happiness in what\u2019d been a bad situation.\u201d</p><p>Landon said, \u201cGoggie,\u201d and Lexie rose from her spot by the door and headed toward him, tail wagging.</p> <p>Jessie kissed the top of Landon\u2019s head. \u201cSee? She\u2019ll come to you if you ask nice.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the dog with the hand holding the cup and almost clunked Lexie on the head with it.</p><p>Lexie slunk away.</p><p>\u201cAnd...that lasted thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Brandt stepped in. Landon squirmed off her lap and ran to him. \u201cUp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Whoa. Watch the cup, buddy.\u201d He lifted Landon and his gaze traveled between Jessie and Keely.</p> <p>Jessie knew Brandt wanted to march over and lay a big wet kiss on her like he always did after a day on the ranch. But he refrained. \u201cKeely. You\u2019re lookin\u2019 tan. Glad to be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We could\u2019ve used another two weeks. I told Jack next time we get married, we\u2019re taking an entire month for our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Brandt stayed on the rug in his work clothes. \u201cJess, have you fed the animals yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Landon was sleeping and Keely stopped by so I haven\u2019t had a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019n me got chores to finish, boy. Come on let\u2019s getcha suited up.\u201d</p><p>Keely didn\u2019t say anything until after Brandt and Landon were out the door. \u201cThis feels bigger than you guys just playing house. It sure as hell feels bigger than temporary.\u201d</p><p>It does to me sometimes too. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou afraid Brandt will break my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll break his.\u201d</p><p>Jessie froze. She wasn\u2019t expecting that.</p><p>\u201cI probably better get back.\u201d Keely leapt out of the chair and wrapped her scarf around her neck.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you need to talk, Jess, just call. I mean it. There are things...\u201d She smiled. \u201cNever mind. Ignore me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no. You can\u2019t just drop that into conversation and leave. What kind of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper... People want to believe he\u2019s just a grumpy old man, but we both know he\u2019s not. People want to believe it\u2019s not as bad as it looks in his household, but I\u2019m telling you, it is. He wields a heavy hand with his wife and his sons, full and total control. I know Luke shielded you from a lot of what went on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Brandt will too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m telling you it won\u2019t be pretty if he ever decides to let go of the anger and resentment he\u2019s been carrying around for years. Back to that annoyingly perfect comment, you are just the type of woman he needs. You\u2019re the only woman I know who can handle anything that\u2019s thrown at you and keep standing. But that means if Brandt actually opens up to you, and you leave him, you\u2019ll do more than just break his heart. You might just break him.\u201d</p><p>Jessie stared after Keely, shocked, but not really. Brandt had a hard edge he tried very hard to hide, not only from her but from everyone. Part of her wanted him to open up that side of himself, while part of her feared it if he did.</p><p>She wondered how long before he trusted her enough to even admit it was there.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Mark my words; Jessie is using you as much as you\u2019re using her. You\u2019ll always be a pale imitation of Luke in her eyes and everyone else\u2019s.</p><p>His father was such a jackass Brandt threw his truck in reverse and his tires spit gravel as he sped away from the machine shed.</p><p>The day had started out perfect. It was one of those times when all was right with his world. When Brandt knew he was exactly where he was supposed to be doing exactly what he\u2019d been meant to do: be a steward of this Wyoming land he loved. Some of his cousins weren\u2019t keen on being part of the McKay cattle company, they\u2019d moved on, but Brandt couldn\u2019t understand that mindset. He loved the ranch. He loved the day to day back breaking work. The cycle of seasons. The unpredictability of the cattle market and the weather. Working with his brothers day in and day out. The humility of being a part of something that was so much bigger than him. From the time he was a little boy, all he wanted was to look across this gorgeous hunk of earth and know it belonged to him. As he\u2019d gotten older, he realized that he belonged to the land\u2014it owned him, heart and soul. He couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.</p><p>Naturally his father noticed his good mood and felt entitled to destroy it.</p><p>Goddamn him.</p><p>At times like this, when clouds of rage fogged rational thought, Brandt was half-tempted to keep driving until he ran out of gas. And then keep walking until he ran out of energy. What he hated most of all was the way his father could twist his love of the ranch into something ugly. Into Brandt berating himself for sticking around because he\u2019d always be second banana to Luke. He\u2019s always be a verbal punching bag for his father.</p><p>God knows he\u2019d tried\u2014and failed\u2014to protect Tell and Dalton from suffering the same fate. He\u2019d watched his mother become a shell of a woman. Thinking that all these sacrifices and drama would mean something in the end when his father trusted him enough to turn over all the ranch operations to his oldest son.</p><p>Yeah, the McKays were just one big happy fucking family and it\u2019d just gotten worse in the two years since Luke had died.</p><p>If the urge to physically lash out wouldn\u2019t go away, he\u2019d head to a bar, drink until he was ten foot tall and bulletproof, and start a fight. It never made him feel better. In fact, he\u2019d usually end up bloodied, bruised and broken. His compulsion to fight wasn\u2019t something he was proud of\u2014the primitive need to Lorelei James</p><p>prove himself with his fists was his deepest shame. His cousins Colt and Kane both had the same violent streak. When Colt\u2019s punching bag wasn\u2019t enough to keep his demons at bay, he and Kane mixed it up. At least they had each other to take the edge off. Brandt had no one. And Luke had taken perverse pleasure in denying Brandt a good fight.</p><p>He imagined one of those head shrinking docs would have a field day trying to analyze him, especially since the violence was never directed at anyone he knew.</p><p>Right now he wanted so badly to drive to some hole in the wall bar where no one knew who he was.</p><p>He\u2019d drink, come out swinging and after having his ass handed to him, or ending up victorious, he\u2019d sleep off the booze and the pain in his truck. Then he\u2019d feel calmer.</p><p>Why not go to Jessie? She has a calming influence on you.</p><p>Jessie.</p><p>Now that they were sleeping together, he couldn\u2019t get enough of her and she\u2019d held nothing back from him in bed or out. She\u2019d given everything of herself to him one hundred percent. He wanted her body under his the last thing before he went to sleep at night. He wanted her body beneath his first thing in the morning. He wanted her after he\u2019d just had her. He thought about all the different ways he\u2019d take her while he was taking her. If he thought he\u2019d been obsessed with her before, it was nothing compared to the craving he had for her now.</p><p>Which was why he had to stay away from her right now.</p><p>He texted Jessie, letting her know he\u2019d be late without going into detail. Then he called his mother, who was watching Landon at his house, telling her he had to finish a couple of things. She didn\u2019t complain or ask questions, but then again, she never did.</p><p>Brandt gave his mother\u2019s car a cursory glance and parked his truck behind his barn.</p><p>Too bad he didn\u2019t have backbreaking tasks like splitting wood or digging new postholes that would exhaust him. He shucked off his coat and let his anger lead him into total destruction mode. Grabbing a sledgehammer and a crowbar, he began to rip apart the last stall with the loose and broken boards. He couldn\u2019t afford to upgrade to metal and they were too damn dangerous as is.</p><p>The sledgehammer came down, the loud thwack followed by another thwack thwack thwack until he couldn\u2019t hear anything besides the blood pounding in his ears. Sweat poured down his face. When he had the boards loosened, he used his hands to break them free. The muscles in his back screamed. Slivers penetrated his holey gloves, but he didn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t stop. Not until it was done. Not until this consuming fury was gone.</p><p>He finally took a break when he was down to one long board on the backside. Placing the heels of his hands above his knees, he bent over, sucking in huge gasps of air, half-wondering when he\u2019d started heating the barn because his skin was on fire.</p><p>The hinge on the barn door squeaked and he blinked the sweat from his eyes as he glanced up.</p><p>His mother stood in the doorway.</p><p>No one he cared about should ever see him like this. Embarrassment had him snarling, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie called about thirty minutes ago when she couldn\u2019t reach you on your cell. She\u2019s on her way here.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? \u201cI told her I was gonna be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tipped her off to your mood.\u201d Her gaze darted to the destroyed stall and back to him.</p><p>\u201cWhich is a little destructive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis piece of shit needed to be torn down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the stall, son. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be best if you went back on up to the house and let me finish this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes focused on his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face. Come inside with me and I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d</p> <p>Brandt shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade by a rusty nail. When was your last tetanus shot? Just let me take a quick look\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he practically bellowed. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I cannot be around anyone right now.\u201d</p><p>Her face registered surprise, then hurt. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>His entire being quaked and words poured out a stilted mess. \u201cI hate that he still has that much power over me. I hate that he can get a reaction out of me when no one else can. I hate it\u2019s a test to see if I\u2019m strong enough to fight this...fucking rage I inherited from him. I\u2019ve tried so hard not to end up like him. So fucking hard and when I act this way, I\u2019m exactly like him and I hate it. I hate myself.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes overflowed with pain, not tears, which was harder for him, because he suspected she\u2019d cried herself out over the years.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like him, Brandt. Nothing. Don\u2019t ever give yourself an excuse to act like him by saying it\u2019s inevitable that you will end up like him, because it\u2019s not. You\u2019ve chosen to be different. Even when you\u2019re like this you\u2019re different. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>For the millionth time he wondered how this caring woman had coped with Casper McKay\u2019s bitterness for so many years.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I thought I\u2019d give you a heads up about Jessie, so you can, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it together before I see her?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be right there. Just give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long, because she will come looking for you first thing.\u201d</p><p>Not an accusation; a fact.</p><p>She left.</p><p>Despite the agony in his arm and the muscles screaming in his back, he lifted the sledgehammer. But it was a half-hearted swing at best.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t calm, but he wasn\u2019t in that dark place either. He snagged his coat off the floor and walked outside, breathing in the fresh air to cool him down.</p><p>Jessie waited for him by the steps, wearing an anxious expression.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t muster a smile, but he went on the offensive. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get my text?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I said I was gonna be late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because I knew something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got that from my text message?\u201d</p><p>Jessie placed her hand on his chest. \u201cI had a feeling something wasn\u2019t right, and seeing you, I see my gut instinct was dead on.\u201d</p><p>Far as he knew, no woman ever had a gut feeling about him. Certainly no woman had never cared enough to follow through with it and make sure he was all right. He held her face between his gloved hands and kissed her. \u201cJess. I\u2019m fine. Now let\u2019s go inside. It\u2019s cold out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how come you\u2019re sweating?\u201d</p><p>Woman was too damn intuitive for her own good. Brandt pressed his lips to hers, bestowing several soft smooches. \u201cBecause you\u2019re so hot, baby, just lookin\u2019 at you makes me sweat.\u201d</p><p>She smooched him back. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it, cowboy charmer. I\u2019ll let it slide for now, because I\u2019m sure your mom is anxious to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that,\u201d Brandt said dryly. He took Jessie\u2019s hand and led her inside.</p><p>His mother put her finger to her lips. \u201cLandon just went down a half hour ago. I know it\u2019s late for a nap, but he had so much energy today. I tried to get him to lay down with me on the couch, but he wasn\u2019t having any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how that goes, so no big deal,\u201d Jessie said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for watchin\u2019 him today, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy him. He reminds me so much of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Not Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn looks he\u2019s nearly identical to his father.\u201d Joan slipped on her coat. \u201cBut in temperament, he could be your son.\u201d She leaned over to kiss his cheek. \u201cTake care of yourself, Brandt. If you need anything, call.\u201d</p><p>Brandt ditched his outerwear and headed to the refrigerator. Might as well have a beer if he was sticking around until Landon woke up. But he hadn\u2019t been here much the past few weeks and he was out of beer.</p><p>Whiskey?</p><p>Nah. In his mood that\u2019d lead to trouble.</p><p>He exited the kitchen and said to Jessie, \u201cIf you wanna head home, I\u2019ll hang out until kidzilla awakens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to get rid of me, Brandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m not the best company right now.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered forward. \u201cSo maybe we shouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t move. \u201cNot a good idea, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tense. I have a remedy for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>Jessie lifted a brow. \u201cNever heard that from you before.\u201d</p><p>And likely she wouldn\u2019t again. \u201cLook. I appreciate the offer, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOffer?\u201d she repeated. \u201cLike you\u2019d be doing me a favor by doing me?\u201d Her face shuttered. \u201cScrew that. I\u2019m outta here.\u201d She turned so fast her coattails whapped him on the knee.</p><p>He grabbed her out of reflex. \u201cWhoa. This is exactly what I didn\u2019t want to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongrats. You made it happen anyway.\u201d</p><p>He hauled her against his chest, imprisoning her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You started this, Jess, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his mouth to the shell of her ear. \u201cI want you, okay? Fuck. I always want you. But I\u2019m on edge in a big way today, and it\u2019d be better if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shut me out? Wow. Like I\u2019ve never dealt with that from a McKay man before.\u201d</p><p>Once again, she\u2019d pushed the wrong button. In a flash, he crowded her against the living room wall.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting yourself into by taunting me.\u201d</p><p>Jessie lifted her chin. \u201cShow me. You won\u2019t shock me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bet on that, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Then she shocked him by wreathing her arms around his neck and whispering, \u201cTrust me. Please.</p><p>Don\u2019t shut me out. Let me in. I\u2019m here for you however you need me.\u201d Her cool fingers settled on his nape.</p><p>Damn. Her touch felt good, soothing him and stirring him up. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of control right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you admitting that Brandt McKay, the almighty gentleman cowboy, is showing me that he\u2019s not always as even-keeled as he projects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a start.\u201d Jessie crushed her lips to his, inhaling him with a take-no-prisoners kiss and ground her pelvis against his. When he stupidly tried to pull away, she held him tighter, kissed him harder and he was done fighting her. Done fighting himself.</p><p>Brandt wrested control, frantic to touch her everywhere, her throat, her breasts, her belly, between her thighs. Letting his desire for her burn up any residual anger. Letting her help him take the edge off. Letting her in.</p><p>She writhed against him. When Jessie dropped her hand over his fly to unzip his jeans, he growled and ended all body contact.</p><p>He stepped back. \u201cClothes off.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, she was completely naked.</p><p>He turned her around. \u201cPut your hands flat on the wall.\u201d</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t being obedient for his sake, because he wanted it this way. She wanted it this way. Her breathing had become erratic. Her body rippled with that fuck me now tremor that kicked his lust into the danger zone. He let his mouth tease her ear. \u201cYou sure you want this? Me fucking you, only thinkin\u2019 about how good it\u2019ll feel when I\u2019m buried balls deep in your tight cunt? You really want me to use you hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God yes.\u201d</p><p>Brandt slipped his fingers between her thighs and found her soaked. A primitive yowl in his head had him jerking his shirttails free from his jeans. Belt unfastened, zipper undone, he removed his jeans only to the tops of his boots because he was obsessed with getting inside her and couldn\u2019t wait to get completely undressed.</p><p>\u201cBrandt.\u201d</p><p>Please don\u2019t say stop. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>His cock slapped his belly before he impatiently shoved it between her legs and impaled her with one greedy push.</p><p>Her full body quiver was followed by a low-pitched, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Brandt curled his hands over her hips and pulled her back, completely controlling her movements. His pelvis smacking her ass made a discordant slap slap slap sound that was almost as satisfying as Jessie\u2019s guttural moans bouncing back to him.</p><p>He reached around until his finger breached the soft nest of curls, gliding down to where their bodies were joined at the mouth of her sex. Then he slid his wet finger back up her slit to stroke her slippery nub in a gentle motion that countered the ferocity of his cock surging into her. But in this position he couldn\u2019t get deep enough. He widened his stance, but his strokes became even shallower, so he stopped moving.</p><p>Jessie turned to look at him. \u201cBrandt? Why did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more of you. Lean back.\u201d She emitted a shriek when he lifted her, balancing her ass on his pelvis like she was sitting on a chair. \u201cTuck your feet around the outside of my boots.\u201d Soon as she did, they both groaned, because damn, that one little change immediately brought him deeper. He angled her body forward, flattening her palm on the wall, wrapping her left arm behind his neck before he slapped his left hand on the wall across from hers. With his chest plastered to her back, he gritted out, \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>Fucking her this way was a rush, not only because of the slant and position of their bodies, but because there was no finesse. No sweetness. Just desperation. Just need. His hips bucked as he kept his free hand cupped over her mound to tease her clit. He closed his eyes, losing himself in the sensation of Jessie pressing back against him as he pressed into her tight heat. Knowing there was nowhere on earth he\u2019d rather be. Knowing her acceptance of this side of him would only cement his determination to have her as his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rocked into her, letting that humming greed for release amplify until they were both panting.</p><p>Sweating.</p><p>When she rolled her hips side to side, he knew she teetered on the brink. For all his blustering about using her hard, he wouldn\u2019t ever deny her an orgasm.</p> <p>He whispered fiercely, \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me. God, please...\u201d</p><p>Brandt separated her pussy lips with his fingers and flicked his middle finger over the responsive flesh until he felt her clit expand. \u201cSqueeze me harder. Yeah, like that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before he finished speaking she unraveled. Her ass cheeks clenching against his groin, her cunt a vise-like grip around his cock, her clit pulsating beneath his finger, her nails digging into the back of his neck, her passion-dampened skin rubbing against his wherever they touched. She moaned his name, over and over. His name. No one else\u2019s.</p><p>When the word mine flashed behind his lids, he lost it. Fucking her with fast jabs, slamming home with every stroke. Holding his breath until he was woozy. Heart thundering, blood blazing, skin slicked with sweat, every muscle coiled tighter and tighter until that perfect moment when everything unwound.</p> <p>He shouted as his cock emptied in almost violent pulses, no coherent thoughts registered beyond the words again, again, again. Nothing in the world existed but the connection of their bodies locked together.</p><p>Then he felt Jessie lightly scraping her teeth along the rigid line of his jaw.</p><p>His grip on her increased\u2014mentally and physically\u2014he never wanted to let her go. \u201cI...Wow. I\u2019m a little out of it.\u201d</p><p>She murmured, \u201cNo worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He nuzzled her hair, breathing her in. Filling his lungs, his heart, his soul with everything this woman freely gave him, no matter how much he asked of her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJessie, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips to his. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I want to explain why, after I just fucked you like a madman, I have this overwhelming urge to spin you around and fuck you face to face against the wall?\u201d He nipped the section of skin below her earlobe just to feel her entire body shiver while he was still inside her. Just to hear that sexy little moan she made. \u201cAnd then I want to take you to my bed and keep you there all goddamn night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou afraid I\u2019ll say no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll say yes.\u201d</p><p>Her purring laugh vibrated against his throat.</p><p>Then Brandt heard Landon rattling the bars on his crib.</p><p>They both froze.</p> <p>He sighed. \u201cDuty calls. At least he had good timing and didn\u2019t interrupt us again like he did last night.\u201d</p><p>The way Jessie\u2019s whole body stiffened, he realized Landon hadn\u2019t crossed her mind at all. But rather than laugh it off, chalking their oversight up to head-exploding orgasmic intensity, he knew she felt guilty.</p><p>She wiggled and demanded, \u201cLet me down. I\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>Later, when they were snuggled together on the couch, watching TV, Jessie reached for his hand and he winced.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, nothin\u2019. Just a little sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>From beating the shit out of my barn today. \u201cFrom workin\u2019. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s no big deal then let me see it.\u201d</p><p>Brandt held out his right hand and turned the palm side up. The glove had rubbed his skin raw. Where the glove had holes, he had slivers. Even his fingertips were scraped up.</p><p>\u201cOh, your poor hand. Are those wood slivers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay put. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She returned with tweezers, a needle, a washcloth, and a tube of anti-bacterial ointment.</p><p>\u201cHere I was hopin\u2019 that was a bottle of lube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later. Right now, I\u2019m gonna get those slivers out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother because I hardly even noticed them.\u201d</p><p>But Jessie wasn\u2019t deterred. \u201cI noticed them and I happen to excel at sliver removal, so you\u2019re in luck.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head close to his palm and started poking his skin with the needle.</p><p>As much as he didn\u2019t want to ask if she\u2019d done this for Luke, his mouth had other ideas. \u201cHow\u2019s it that you\u2019re so good with tweezers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen me\u2019n Josie were kids, there was this really cool abandoned tree fort in the woods behind our house. We weren\u2019t supposed to go there, but we couldn\u2019t resist. Problem was, it had an old rope to climb to reach the wooden platform and we both ended up with a lot of splinters. Since the tree fort had been expressly forbidden, we couldn\u2019t tell Mom about the slivers, so me\u2019n my little sister both got really good at picking them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was your mom when you were sneakin\u2019 off to the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your dad?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cBilly? Off rodeoin\u2019, where he always was.\u201d</p><p>Jessie rarely talked about her family. In fact, that was the first time he\u2019d heard she had a sister.</p><p>She worked in silence and with such a deft touch he didn\u2019t feel a damn thing. And his hand was much more tender than he\u2019d wanted to admit.</p><p>She said, \u201cAlmost done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but you didn\u2019t have to do this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t do it for you. I did it for me, for purely selfish reasons. See, I love the feel of your rough, manly hands on me, but not so much if they\u2019re swollen and pus-infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice visual,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a reason you\u2019ll accept a lot easier than me admitting I can\u2019t stand to see you hurting. Not when I can do something to help you or something to stop it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Brandt knew he loved her. Not lusted after her. Not felt obligated to her. He loved her.</p><p>Loved who she was, this woman who tended to him in so many ways. Who touched him in ways he was only beginning to understand.</p><p>Jessie finally looked at him. She brought his hand to her mouth and placed a tender kiss in the center of his palm. \u201cAll better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re done, will you let me put my hands all over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m thinking these need to heal up so it\u2019d be best if I put my hands all over you.\u201d She smiled with wicked intent. \u201cWe still get to the same destination, but I hold the reins.\u201d</p><p>Brandt groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna torture me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I promise you\u2019ll love it.\u201d She gave him a thoughtful look. \u201cNow. What did I do with those ropes?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s okay. I understand.\u201d Jessie forced a laugh. \u201cYeah, cell service is shitty in Wyoming.\u201d She walked into the kitchen and set her empty coffee cup in the sink. \u201cI\u2019ll check the road conditions. Uh-huh.</p><p>I\u2019ll let you know. Bye, Billy.\u201d</p><p>Jessie punched the off button on her cell phone and stared at the snowy landscape out Brandt\u2019s front window. They\u2019d finished chores as quickly as possible this morning because of the bone chilling cold.</p><p>She\u2019d looked forward to spending the whole day snuggled up with Brandt since Tell and Dalton had taken on babysitting duties.</p><p>But now...</p><p>Strong arms circled her waist. The clean scent of a freshly showered and shaved Brandt surrounded her. His warm, soft lips traveled up the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cWho was on the phone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBilly...as in...your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Brandt quit kissing her neck and spun her to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He was just calling to let me know he\u2019s competing at an event in Gillette. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday? He couldn\u2019t\u2019ve told you before now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s how he operates, Brandt. In his own little rodeo world. Nothing else matters but chasing eight and winning that elusive gold buckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, did he call you to tell you he\u2019s just passin\u2019 through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny is he probably drove within ten miles of my place and he couldn\u2019t be bothered...\u201d</p><p>Jessie extricated herself from Brandt\u2019s arms, hating the girlish, whining tone to her voice. So Billy didn\u2019t care enough to pop in and say howdy. Hell. She should be happy he remembered she lived in Wyoming.</p><p>Happy. Right. The man flat out didn\u2019t give a damn about her.</p><p>Like his apathy is news, Jessie.</p><p>True. But it didn\u2019t stop the hollow feeling from expanding, a feeling she only got when she heard from her vagabond father.</p><p>But Brandt wouldn\u2019t let her shut herself off, especially not after she\u2019d pushed him to deal with his mood the other day. \u201cJess. Baby, talk to me. What did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to come to Gillette to watch him ride and he wants us to catch up. Jesus. I haven\u2019t seen him for three years. The last time was at the Niobrara Rodeo with Luke. And to say Billy and Luke didn\u2019t hit it off is putting it mildly. Luke told him a grown man should face up to his responsibilities, not run off and join the damn rodeo.\u201d</p><p>Brandt whistled. \u201cNot that I disagree with anything Luke said, but I imagine that didn\u2019t go over well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, Billy laughed it off. Said he\u2019d take his judgment before God, not men.\u201d She brooded, remembering just how mortifying that conversation had been. It\u2019d gotten worse after Luke had spouted off that being brave on the back of a bronc didn\u2019t mean shit when Billy was too much of a coward to stay with his wife and kids.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did they say? Because I can tell you\u2019re holding something back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBilly reminded Luke that paying lip service to a sacred vow was a sin. Talk about humiliating. Billy knew Luke was cheating on me. Which made me wonder if cheaters recognize cheaters, or if Billy knew I wasn\u2019t enough to hold Luke\u2019s interest for the long haul.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Evidently Brandt had no response for that.</p><p>\u201cSo you goin\u2019 to Gillette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How freakin\u2019 pathetic is that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot pathetic. Just hopeful things might change between you and your father, and darlin\u2019, that\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve been familiar with my whole life.\u201d Brandt kissed the top of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t fault you for that hope, but I\u2019m worried how it\u2019ll affect you if this trip ends up bein\u2019 another dose of the same old, same old.</p><p>So, if you\u2019re goin\u2019, I\u2019m goin\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>Jessie cranked her head around to look at him. \u201cReally? You\u2019d give up your one free weekend day to drive to Gillette and sit in an arena that smells like the barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not givin\u2019 up anything. I\u2019ll be with you. That\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d Brandt kissed her again, soundly.</p><p>Any mention of his feelings for her made her wary, but Brandt did it every chance he had. That\u2019s just the way he was.</p> <p>Hands roamed, breathing became hot and heavy as the kiss heated. But she didn\u2019t break the connection, Brandt did. He muttered, \u201cWe\u2019d better stop playin\u2019 grab ass if we\u2019re hitting the road.\u201d</p><p>She nipped his bottom lip. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time for a quickie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He slapped her butt and stepped back. \u201cI want more than a quickie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could stay here and spend the entire day in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time. You need to see your dad, even if it\u2019s only for a little while. Call him and tell him we\u2019re on our way.\u201d Brandt pointed at her clothes. \u201cYou gonna change?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the dirt and manure stained coveralls. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I oughta meet Billy in my work clothes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what you wear, Jess, you know that. Just curious how soon you\u2019ll be ready. I hafta call Tell and Dalton and update them on our plans before we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me five minutes.\u201d</p><p>In Brandt\u2019s room, she dug in her duffel bag for the extra pair of jeans. She switched out her ratty long sleeved T-shirt for a newer one, wishing she\u2019d packed something nicer. Her gaze strayed to the closet.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d just wear one of Brandt\u2019s shirts.</p><p>Her fingers trailed over the slim selection until she reached a shirt the color of burgundy roses, shoved in the very back of his closet. Not exactly Brandt\u2019s shade. Curious, she pulled it out and realized it was a woman\u2019s shirt.</p><p>Huh. Brandt wasn\u2019t the player his brothers were, but she doubted he\u2019d been a monk. She heard about the on-again, off-again girlfriend. He probably wasn\u2019t aware his last squeeze had left it here.</p><p>Too bad, so sad. Finder\u2019s keepers.</p><p>She buttoned it. Nice fit. Really nice fit. This expensive brand had always been out of her price range.</p> <p>She stopped in the bathroom and brushed her hair before returning to the living room where Brandt waited.</p><p>\u201cReady? You look...\u201d His smile dried as he noticed the rose-colored shirt.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind. I\u2019m out of clean clothes so I borrowed it from your closet, because truthfully, this one really doesn\u2019t match your color palette.\u201d</p><p>His slow aw shucks grin brought out his dimples. \u201cI forgot Lydia left it here or I\u2019da turned it into a grease rag. Keep it if you want. It looks better on you than it ever did on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Lexie barked happily at the word go.</p><p>\u201cSorry, not today.\u201d Jessie ruffled her dog\u2019s ears. \u201cIs it okay if she stays inside the house while we\u2019re gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I already let her out. Amazing how quick she is about her goggie business when it\u2019s ten below outside.\u201d</p><p>Bundling up, she followed Brandt to his truck. She loved how he held the driver\u2019s side door for her.</p><p>She scooted across the bench seat, stopping in the middle. As soon as they were on the road, he set his forearm on her thigh and curled his hand around her knee. She laid her head on his shoulder, perfectly content.</p><p>Silences between them weren\u2019t unusual. So it surprised her when Brandt said, \u201cSeems quiet without Landon babbling in the background.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost makes you wish he wasn\u2019t trying so hard to talk, huh?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWhen I talked to Tell, he said Landon wrassled a bear last night. Granted, it was a teddy bear, but I\u2019ll bet my brothers don\u2019t make that small distinction to Landon as he\u2019s growing up.</p><p>Already tryin\u2019 to make the kid tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it such a point of pride that the McKays are known for their toughness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a point of pride as much as it is proof that if you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. So we\u2019ve all gotta stand our ground because none of us wanna be considered the weakest link.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere your dad and your uncles like that too?\u201d</p><p>His posture stiffened. Was Brandt aware how his body changed whenever his dad was mentioned?</p><p>\u201cThey all had a reputation for brawlin\u2019 with each other and with any unlucky sucker who crossed them. Course, if I hadn\u2019t talked to my cousins, I never would\u2019ve known any of that. If it hadn\u2019t been for Aunt Kimi, none of us\u2014Casper\u2019s sons\u2014would\u2019ve known our grandpop. He lived with Uncle Cal and Aunt Kimi, which pissed my dad off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She knew little of the McKay family history because Luke never wanted to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cGrandpop made it clear he\u2019d rather live with the daughter of the man he hated than with his own son.</p><p>I suspect that was the start of the issues between my dad and his brothers, but no one has ever confirmed that\u2019s what sparked the problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily drama. Ain\u2019t it fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jess. I won\u2019t pick a fight with a random stranger or do anything to embarrass you in front of your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I\u2019m more worried he\u2019ll do something to embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>Brandt lifted her hand and kissed her knuckles.</p><p>Jessie appreciated he didn\u2019t make false promises that everything between her and Billy would be hunky-dory, sparkly rainbows and lollipops.</p><p>The roads to Gillette were icy and Brandt concentrated on driving. She must\u2019ve dozed off because the next thing she knew, Brandt was shaking her awake.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re at the Camplex.\u201d</p><p>She stretched. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve. What time does the rodeo start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing one o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you meeting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the contestant area. Not that I have a clue where that is. I\u2019ve never been to the Camplex.\u201d</p><p>Brandt frowned. \u201cDidn\u2019t you travel around with your dad for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the summer I met you at the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat was the third and final event I attended with him. I cramped his style.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhich was why I ended up in the bar that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember running into us\u2014me\u2019n Luke at the rodeo earlier that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. That\u2019s how I found out about the dance. Luke asked me to come.\u201d</p><p>Brandt parked. Then he turned, cupping her face to give her a tender kiss. \u201cAny time you\u2019re ready to leave, give me a signal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have a code word,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot, kinky sex?\u201d</p><p>Brandt grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t even wanna know how you\u2019d work that into casual conversation with your dad sittin\u2019 right there, so maybe we oughta come up something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about slow dancing, in honor of our first meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. But I feel obligated to mention that you slow danced with my brother, not me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut I know we two-stepped.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSorry. You only had eyes for Luke.\u201d</p><p>No point in arguing that one.</p><p>They paid the entrance fee to the arena and tracked down the contestant\u2019s area. No one was admitted behind the chutes, but the gatekeeper sent someone to locate Billy Reynolds.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s old fears surfaced. What if Billy had changed his mind at the last minute and had bypassed the Gillette rodeo? Wouldn\u2019t be the first time. In truth, Billy had left her hanging more times than he\u2019d followed through with any plans they\u2019d made. She could claim she\u2019d outgrown that fear, but it was embarrassing that Billy Reynolds still had the ability to hurt and disappoint her.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s warm, rough, strong hand slipped into hers.</p><p>Somehow he knew. Ever since the day she hadn\u2019t walked away when he\u2019d been hurting, things had changed between them. No declarations of love. Just a deeper level of acceptance. Even for things they didn\u2019t speak of. Like what\u2019d happened to Brandt that day to turn him inside out. Like now, when she reverted to the young girl hanging on the corrals, hoping for attention from an absent father before he took off again.</p><p>One thing they didn\u2019t speak of? What would happen when Landon\u2019s mother got out of jail. As far as Jessie was concerned, nothing had changed on that front and Brandt knew it.</p><p>\u201cJessie?\u201d came from behind her.</p><p>She turned and came face to face with Billy. Her father. Technically, her stepfather. Whenever she hadn\u2019t seen him for a while, it surprised her how short he was, especially since he\u2019d always seemed larger than life in her younger years. He wore a different hat\u2014black, instead of the stained gray one she remembered. His plaid shirt was pressed. His faded jeans were covered in arena dust. A championship buckle was centered between his hips and above the cinch strap on his dark brown chaps. His boots were scuffed, scarred and faded. When he tipped his hat up, revealing his face, the lines bracketing his lips and stretching across his forehead startled her. Billy had always looked at least a decade younger than his actual age, but it seemed that\u2019d caught up with him\u2014he hadn\u2019t aged well in the last three years. Not nice, but true. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBilly.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an awkward hug. \u201cGlad you could make it.\u201d He glanced over at Brandt. \u201cLuke. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Both she and Brandt froze.</p> <p>Billy wasn\u2019t aware he\u2019d made a misstep.</p><p>\u201cLuke died about two years ago, remember? This is Luke\u2019s brother, Brandt McKay. Brandt, this is Billy Reynolds.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Billy said. \u201cSometimes I think I\u2019ve landed on my head too many times and my memory is goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Or you don\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s going on in my life.</p> <p>Acting like a ten-year-old much, Jessie?</p><p>Brandt placed his palm in the small of her back. \u201cGot time to have a Coke or something before you ride, Billy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d They walked to the concession area in silence.</p><p>Well, besides Billy stopping every fifteen feet to chat with someone he knew. Not once in those dozen or so times did Billy bother to introduce Jessie to his friends. So by the time they actually sat down, Jessie was wound so tight that one more snip to her tightly held control and she\u2019d unravel.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s touch stayed steady. He held her hand, or put his arm around her shoulders, or on her back, or on her thigh beneath the table. His support was absolute.</p><p>Billy had always been a man of few words, at least around her, so Jessie was taken aback when he started a conversation without prompting. \u201cHow\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. She\u2019s living in Riverton with Roger.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHappy to hear it. She\u2019s a great lady. Ain\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t wish...\u201d He offered a sheepish smile. \u201cAnyway, it don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Josie?\u201d Jessie asked.</p><p>\u201cOff and on. For a while it seemed I saw her all over the damn place. And in the weirdest places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she was following you or something?\u201d she said, only half-jokingly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t figure out why. It wasn\u2019t like she was competing or dating a professional rodeo cowboy or nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Professional rodeo cowboy. Sounded like a misnomer, but Jessie kept her mouth shut because it was probably just her bitterness about Billy considering himself a professional when he\u2019d spent his entire adult life broke, on the road, chasing a dream. Didn\u2019t sound very professional to her.</p><p>\u201cI shudder to think she\u2019s become one of them trashy buckle bunnies that follows the rodeo from town to town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Josie just wants to learn more about your life on the road,\u201d Jessie suggested.</p><p>Billy scowled. \u201cWhy? She\u2019s a grown woman. She oughta have a life of her own, not worrying about mine. Or checkin\u2019 up on me.\u201d</p><p>Rather than argue, Jessie sipped her Coke.</p><p>Brandt asked, \u201cSo isn\u2019t the rodeo season about wound down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Already been decided who\u2019s competin\u2019 in Vegas for the NFR. I came awful damn close to makin\u2019 the cut, but fell short.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThere\u2019s always next year.\u201d</p><p>How many times had she heard that?</p><p>But Brandt wasn\u2019t easily sidelined. \u201cWhat do you do in the off season?\u201d</p><p>Billy squinted. \u201cOff season? Ain\u2019t no off-season in rodeo. Even if some of the events ain\u2019t got a qualifying purse, there\u2019s always some place havin\u2019 an expo or a one day event. So while I\u2019m waitin\u2019 for the season to get back into full swing, I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to get on as many broncs as I can to improve my buck off percentage for next year. Tryin\u2019 to put a little jingle in my pocket that ain\u2019t comin\u2019 from my spurs.\u201d</p><p>The rodeo announcer tested the PA system.</p><p>Brandt stirred his soda.</p><p>Jessie fiddled with her straw.</p><p>Billy smiled. \u201cSpeakin\u2019 of jingle...\u201d</p><p>Not a very smooth transition, Jessie thought, but subtle never fit Billy. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny chance you could help your old dad out?\u201d</p><p>Dad. Right. He\u2019d insisted she call him Billy round about the time he\u2019d left her mom. \u201cWhatcha need?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, the portrait of sincerity. \u201cThe transmission went out on my truck. It\u2019s at a repair shop here in Gillette, but I\u2019m a couple hundred short on the repair bill.\u201d</p><p>So. This requested meet up with Billy wasn\u2019t spur of the moment. He\u2019d called her because he wanted something. Money.</p><p>Like that\u2019s news, Jessie.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist poking him. \u201cHow long has it been in the repair shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Wednesday. Damn thing blew up right after I got to town. Luckily, I rode well Friday night and ended up in first. Last night I finished second. I\u2019m guaranteed a top five finish today even if I get throwed on my ass. If I finish first overall, it oughta be enough cash to get my truck back. But I ain\u2019t countin\u2019 on it, because them stock contractors brought seriously rank stock for the finals today. I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry, instead of worrying I\u2019ll have to scrub oil pans or something to get my rig outta hock, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been around for four days and hadn\u2019t bothered to call her. That stung worse than the fact he was hitting her up for cash.</p><p>No. That stung like hell too.</p><p>Brandt stopped caressing Jessie\u2019s leg beneath the table and reached in the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to stop Brandt from opening his wallet. She didn\u2019t give a shit if her protest would\u2019ve hurt Billy\u2019s feelings, but she\u2019d never point out to Brandt that his show of generosity was for a man who didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>He tossed three hundred dollar bills on the table and two fifties. \u201cI have a cousin who\u2019s on the road as a professional bull rider, so I know how tough it is when cash is tight. I\u2019d like to think someone would help him out if he needed it.\u201d</p><p>Billy neatly folded the bills and shoved them into his threadbare wallet. \u201cThanks, man. I appreciate it.</p><p>I really do. And I\u2019m considering this a loan, \u2019cause I will pay you back. Every penny. My word is good as gold. Ask anyone \u2019round here.\u201d</p><p>Liar. She noticed Billy didn\u2019t tell Brandt to ask her if his word was good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that,\u201d Brandt said without much conviction.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your cousin\u2019s name?\u201d Billy asked with feigned interest, because even as self-absorbed as he was, he understood it\u2019d be rude to take Brandt\u2019s money and run. \u201cMaybe I know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase McKay. He\u2019s in the PBR.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of him.\u201d</p><p>Another lie. With as much as Billy Reynolds lived and breathed the world of rodeo, he had to\u2019ve heard of Chase, since Chase McKay ranked as one of the top fifteen bull riders in the world.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s an up and comer,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>They chatted politely about nothing.</p><p>Jessie tuned them out. She was too busy wondering if everyone saw hopeful sucker stamped on her forehead or if it was as invisible as she was.</p><p>Billy\u2019s, \u201cWow, look at the time,\u201d brought Jessie back to their conversation. \u201cI gotta stretch out before my ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Brandt thrust his hand across the table. \u201cGood meetin\u2019 you, Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too Brandt. Take good care of my girl.\u201d</p><p>God. Just stop pretending I ever meant anything to you. Stop pretending you care now. You got what you wanted.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie, it was great seein\u2019 you. I hope we\u2019ll cross paths again soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive \u2019em hell on those broncs today, Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d As he shuffled away, she noticed he didn\u2019t have the same spring in his step as he used to.</p><p>Maybe the years beating the shit out of his body had finally begun to take its toll.</p><p>It was ironic Billy\u2019s favorite saying, you reap what you sow, popped into her head at that moment.</p><p>Jessie and Brandt sat side by side, in silence, for several long minutes. Watching people passing by.</p><p>Inhaling the scents of popcorn, nachos, hot dogs and mini-donuts drifting from the concession stand.</p><p>Feeling the anticipation in the air because rodeo kick off time neared.</p><p>When Brandt rubbed her back in a show of support, she had the overwhelming urge to bawl. Instead, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>His hand stilled. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to stay for the performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just seen Billy Reynolds\u2019 best performance today, so let\u2019s call it good and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t say anything until they were out of the arena, in the truck and back on the road. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m such a fucking idiot. I can\u2019t believe I fell for his bullshit. I should\u2019ve gone with my first instinct and told him I was too busy today to drive to Gillette. Now, we\u2019ve wasted a few hours and you\u2019re out four hundred bucks.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhich I will pay you back for, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s my biggest goddamn concern right now, Jessie,\u201d he snapped. \u201cHow long has this been goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A man only showing up when he needs something from me? My whole goddamn life.\u201d</p><p>His lips flattened.</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t bother to assure Brandt he was the exception because he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She expected he\u2019d push her to talk, but he didn\u2019t. Not for several miles. Then he simply said, \u201cI\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to think if you\u2019ve told me anything about your childhood. About Billy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much to tell. My mom was a single parent until she met Billy. He charmed her, bedded her and wedded her. He adopted me the same year my sister Josie was born. You saw him today, Brandt. He\u2019s always been that way. Around when he wanted something, gone when he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever met your biological father?\u201d</p><p>What a loaded question. She knew where Brandt was going with this line of questioning. \u201cNo. My mom put \u2018father unknown\u2019 on my birth certificate because he\u2019d washed his hands of her when she found out she was pregnant with me.\u201d She pressed her fingers against her burning eyes and managed a laugh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds like I have abandonment issues, huh? My \u2018real\u2019 dad bailed on me. Billy bailed on me. But with Luke...he mentally checked out of our relationship before he physically left. So I\u2019ll argue it was different with him. He abandoned me before he died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every man is like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them in my experience have been. So that\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p> <p>Another line of logic Brandt couldn\u2019t dispute.</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jessie held up her hand. \u201cPlease. No more. I have a splitting headache and the glare off the snow is making it worse. I need to close my eyes for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t look too happy, but he said, \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>And she must\u2019ve been more drained than she\u2019d thought because she slept all the way to Brandt\u2019s house.</p> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Brandt waited in the visitation room of the women\u2019s correctional facility in Lusk, wondering if he looked calmer than he felt. It seemed a bad sign, Samantha requesting this meeting, especially when she\u2019d indicated that she didn\u2019t want him to bring Landon.</p><p>The door opened and Samantha shuffled in. She wasn\u2019t handcuffed or shackled, but the neon orange jumpsuit dwarfed her. No doubt Samantha Johnston was a beautiful girl\u2014Brandt still had a hard time thinking of her as a woman. She had milk pale skin and dark brown, almost black hair. But her eyes were the palest shade of blue he\u2019d ever seen. Her eastern European heritage was evident in her facial bone structure. With her slight frame, she looked like a good, stiff wind would knock her over. Striking as she was, she just looked so damn...young.</p><p>Samantha slid into the chair, clasping her hands in front of her on the table. \u201cBrandt. Thanks for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Is it stupid to ask how you\u2019re doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m doing...all right. Except I hate the food. I hate the mandatory therapy sessions. I hate we\u2019re locked down so early at night because I\u2019m a night owl. But I don\u2019t mind working in the laundry.</p> <p>At least it smells clean in there. And they\u2019ve got a computer in the classroom so I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what to do with my life when I get outta here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular jumping out at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Since I\u2019ve got my GED I\u2019m allowed to check out the courses at the community colleges.</p><p>Being\u2019s they\u2019re real big on rehabilitating us here.\u201d</p><p>A guard poked her head in. She nodded to Brandt and the door shut with an ominous thud and a series of clicking locks.</p><p>They only had so much time, and Brandt wasn\u2019t the type to make idle chitchat, especially with someone he didn\u2019t know very well. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you want me to bring Landon along for this visitation?\u201d</p><p>Samantha bit her lip, focusing on her ragged fingernails. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been more than a month since I\u2019ve seen him. Time is totally different in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014I miss him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want to see him. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s grown bigger and he\u2019s changed already. But I don\u2019t think if he came to visit that I could stand to give him back at the end of the hour.\u201d A tear fell on the table. \u201cAs much as he\u2019s a part of my life and being apart from him is the hardest thing I\u2019ve Cowgirls Don\u2019t Cry</p><p>done...it\u2019s surreal. It might sound strange, but I try not to think about him because without having him here, it\u2019s almost like he doesn\u2019t exist. And that\u2019s way easier.\u201d</p><p>Brandt had no idea how he was supposed to respond. On one hand, it sounded like she\u2019d already started to phase Landon out of her life. On the other hand, it sounded like the only way she could deal with the separation was with the \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d philosophy.</p><p>When he stayed quiet too long, she said, \u201cYou think I\u2019m horrible, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to think, Samantha, beyond the fact you\u2019re in a bad situation that won\u2019t improve for at least another three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bad situation of my own making,\u201d she said with a sneer.</p><p>Not touching that one.</p><p>\u201cSorry. That\u2019s one thing about being locked up in here. I\u2019ve got all this time to think.\u201d Her smile wasn\u2019t convincing. \u201cSo tell me about what Landon\u2019s been doing.\u201d</p><p>Brandt relaxed. \u201cHe had a rough time at first, but we got a pretty good handle on it. He goes to daycare on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and my mom takes him the other two days of the week. My brothers Tell and Dalton have helped out. Landon is crazy about dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie.\u201d</p><p>Samantha looked at him, eyes narrowed. \u201cJessie? As in Luke\u2019s wife, Jessie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that Luke\u2019s wife was gonna be one of the people taking care of my child, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>He racked his brain, trying to remember if he\u2019d mentioned Jessie to Samantha. No, he hadn\u2019t, because the idea hadn\u2019t occurred to him until after Samantha had gone to jail. \u201cLast time we spoke, I didn\u2019t exactly have a firm plan in place, besides keeping Landon out of foster care. And since Landon is bein\u2019 well cared for while you\u2019re in jail, I don\u2019t see how Jessie helping out is a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem? I have a problem with it. A big problem. What if she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s doin\u2019 a damn good job?\u201d Brandt supplied.</p><p>She fell back in her chair, arms folded over her chest. \u201cYeah. Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about.</p><p>That she\u2019ll be a better mother than me. And between her, your parents and your brothers, they\u2019ll try to take Landon away.\u201d</p><p>He counted to ten\u2014any outburst would send the guards in\u2014but he wanted to shake Samantha until her teeth rattled. \u201cYou left Landon\u2019s care in my hands and my control. I promised you I\u2019d do everything to keep that from happening.\u201d</p><p>Samantha didn\u2019t answer; she just went back to gnawing on her nails.</p><p>The need to get out of there was almost suffocating him.</p><p>Can you imagine how Samantha feels? Knowing she can\u2019t just leave whenever she wants?</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Brandt prompted. \u201cBecause we\u2019re about outta time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got a pack of cigarettes on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d be more the Copenhagen type anyhow.\u201d Samantha sighed heavily. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m sure it sounds like I don\u2019t appreciate all you\u2019ve done, and all you\u2019re doing, but I do. I really do. I just can\u2019t wait to get out of this place and get back to my life.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to add that she couldn\u2019t wait to get back to her kid, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAs far as the next visitation?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not being melodramatic when I say skip it. I know it\u2019s a drive for you. And the holidays are coming up. I don\u2019t think I could stand to see him, knowing...\u201d Her eyes flooded with tears and she glanced away. \u201cMaybe after Thanksgiving and Christmas I\u2019ll be ready for him. I\u2019ll let you know. I get phone privileges soon so I can call you.\u201d Samantha stood and knocked on the glass partition. The guard let her out and she didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Brandt wasn\u2019t sure how long he sat there, his gut churning with the thought that maybe this situation with Landon wasn\u2019t as temporary as he\u2019d been telling everyone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t call Jessie until he was close to his house. As much as he appreciated she didn\u2019t ask questions about how it\u2019d gone with Samantha, he needed someone to talk to.</p><p>But who? He couldn\u2019t have a rational discussion with his parents or his brothers. His married cousins with kids weren\u2019t options either. If he talked to Kane\u2019s wife, Ginger, she\u2019d probably urge him to prepare for legal action to ensure Landon wasn\u2019t in limbo\u2014even if his mother was.</p><p>Brandt ended up driving to his cousin Ben\u2019s place. In addition to knowing his stuff about ranching, Ben was a damn fine carpenter. It\u2019d taken him six years, but he\u2019d designed and built his log cabin home from the ground up. This house sparked Brandt\u2019s envy like no other house in the vast McKay family. Not only was it spacious with three bedrooms and two baths, including a master bath with a hot tub and a walkin shower, and a kitchen that boasted every possible amenity, it was rugged, a real guy\u2019s space. Animal trophy heads lined the walls. A gigantic game room dominated the layout, with a huge big-screen TV surrounded by comfy couches, and a regulation gaming table that\u2019d comfortably host ten card players. A fully loaded, fifteen-foot hand-carved wooden bar, a pool table, and an electronic dartboard. Just outside the garage was a detached woodshop and a metal barn. No one blamed Ben for being such a homebody when he had a home like this.</p><p>There was the rumor that his playboy cousin had never brought the same woman back to his house twice. A rumor Ben wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny, which is probably why it lived on in the annals of McKay legend.</p><p>Ben ambled out, his dogs Ace and Deuce at his heels, as always. \u201cBrandt. Surprised to see you.</p><p>What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 much. Just drivin\u2019 by and thought I\u2019d stop to see if you had time for a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You wanna come in? Or you wanna head into town?\u201d</p><p>Brandt grinned. \u201cCuz, your bar puts any bar within a hundred miles to shame.\u201d</p><p>Ben grinned back. \u201cThat is true. I was just about to crack a cold one anyway.\u201d</p><p>The dogs followed them back inside and stretched out in front of the wood stove. Brandt parked himself on a barstool and Ben grabbed two Fat Tire beers from the fridge behind the bar. He slid one to Brandt, leaning his elbows on the counter.</p><p>\u201cSo, you wanna exchange bullshit about our families, you ask me how Quinn\u2019s new baby girl Amelia is doin\u2019, or how Chase\u2019s season is goin\u2019 in the PBR. Then I ask you if Dalton and Tell are still banging the Beaumont twins. Or how fuckin\u2019 bizarre it is that Luke fathered a kid with some teenage chick right before he died. Or do you wanna cut the crap and tell me the real reason you stopped by?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandt laughed. Ben always got straight to the point, which was probably why he\u2019d shown up here.</p><p>He took a long pull off his beer. \u201cTo be honest, I ain\u2019t exactly sure why I\u2019m here. I just got done talkin\u2019 to Samantha, Landon\u2019s mom, and she left me with a feeling I can\u2019t shake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike...maybe she\u2019s gotten used to bein\u2019 away from Landon and would like to continue that when they let her out of jail.\u201d</p><p>Ben whistled. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Samantha didn\u2019t come right out and say it, I don\u2019t even know if she was hinting around or if I somehow misread it. And it ain\u2019t like I can talk to anybody in my family about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jessie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer stipulation was no information on Samantha for the duration of this temporary situation. So if it turns out to be a longer temporary situation than four months, and if Samantha decides she\u2019d rather let us raise Landon...\u201d He sighed. \u201cUs, meaning me raising Landon with some help from Dalton, Tell and my mom.\u201d When Ben lifted a questioning brow, Brandt shook his head. \u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way will I let Landon live with my father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how does Aunt Joan feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the same page, since she\u2019s sneaking outta the house one day a week to watch Landon as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s takin\u2019 care of him at her house on Tuesdays, but on Thursdays she tells dad she\u2019s volunteering for some church thing when she\u2019s really at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my dad...\u201d He took a drink of beer. \u201cMom told me she had to go out for an hour and when she got back, Landon was screaming bloody murder in his crib to the point he threw up all over himself.</p> <p>Seems my dad just sat on his ass in the living room and ignored him. Dad\u2019s excuse? The kid needed to learn early on that he wasn\u2019t gonna get his way by screamin\u2019 his fool head off.\u201d His father\u2019s justification was seriously scary shit. \u201cJesus. Landon is barely more than a baby. And my dad\u2019s attitude is Landon is acting manipulative? At seventeen months?\u201d</p><p>Ben pointed with his beer bottle. \u201cHow would it be bad if you ended up bein\u2019 Landon\u2019s guardian? I mean, it\u2019s obvious you care about the kid.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. Didn\u2019t know how to without coming across as a pansy ass whiner.</p><p>Ben whistled again. \u201cThis has to do with Jessie, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019d have to choose, Ben. And how the fuck do I do that? Choose between the only living part of Luke I\u2019ll ever have or the only woman I\u2019ve ever...\u201d He scowled. Way to be a pansy-ass.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna point out the obvious end to that statement, but maybe you\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019</p><p>on with you and Jessie? And how long has it been goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the moment I saw her.\u201d Brandt drained his beer. Ben uncapped a fresh one and set it in front of him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. Keep talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you wanna hear this? It\u2019s old news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in your family it is, but I\u2019ve never heard it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke and I were at the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo and Jessie was there. I noticed her first, something about her just...hit me. Anyway, like a total dumbass, I pointed her out to Luke. And Luke, bein\u2019 the handsome fuckin\u2019 cowboy charmer he was, got to her first, which meant I didn\u2019t stand a chance. So over the next month I had to listen to every goddamned detail of how Luke seduced her. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Luke liked her, probably because she was so different from the type of women he usually dated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t trashy or wild. I think Luke saw a lot of our mom in Jessie. I also think he would\u2019ve gotten tired of her, but he knocked her up. They got married, she lost the baby, and then my brother started stepping out on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. I\u2019m sorry Brandt, but that\u2019s bullshit. If he didn\u2019t wanna be married to her, he should\u2019ve asked for a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told him. And Tell told him. And Dalton told him. Hell, my dad kept tellin\u2019 Luke to divorce Jessie, too, but Luke took extreme joy in doin\u2019 the exact opposite of what Dad wanted, as often as possible. Jessie was caught in the middle. So was I.</p><p>\u201cCut to me stepping in and tryin\u2019 to fill Luke\u2019s shoes after he died. So about a year later, I spilled my guts to her\u2014yes, I was sober\u2014and goddamn if she didn\u2019t give me the \u2018friend\u2019 speech. I licked my wounds and tried like hell to erase her from my memory by becoming the wild McKay I\u2019d never been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even fuckin\u2019 close. After she agreed to help me take care of Landon, things have changed between us. In a good way. Now I\u2019ve got her in my life and in my bed and I don\u2019t want it to be a temporary fling. But it won\u2019t happen if I become Landon\u2019s permanent guardian. So yeah, I\u2019m fucked.\u201d Brandt swallowed a drink of beer. \u201cAin\u2019t ya glad you asked?\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed. \u201cAs the McKay World Turns, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m just glad all this shit isn\u2019t common knowledge with our McKay relatives, although they can probably put the pieces together now that Luke\u2019s illegitimate love kid has surfaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be freakin\u2019 out over nothin\u2019, Brandt. From what I understand, Samantha changing her mind is the worst case scenario.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But in my experience? It\u2019s always the worst case scenario that plays out.\u201d</p><p>Ben returned with another beer for himself.</p><p>\u201cSo...got any advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He swigged his beer and then grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly true. I\u2019m more of an observation type guy, so I\u2019ll tell you how I see it. You\u2019re asking yourself what you\u2019d have to sacrifice to keep her. But why wouldn\u2019t she have to sacrifice something in order to be with you? Unless she owns up to a few things, seems you\u2019re back to being a in one-sided situation and she still has all the power.\u201d</p><p>Going round and round with this was pointless. Brandt switched gears. \u201cWhat the fuck happened to Chase in Dallas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw him getting tossed into the air and that bull dancin\u2019 the cha-cha on his back?\u201d</p><p>Brandt nodded. \u201cIf he ain\u2019t still pissing blood after that kidney shot, he\u2019s got my vote for Iron Man of the Year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got my vote for dumbass of the year. Here he\u2019s havin\u2019 the best year of his career and he had a chance to finish in the top fifteen at the world finals. After that last wreck, the sports med doc warned him to drop out. He did, but in his free time while he\u2019s supposed to be healin\u2019 up, Chase has gotten into some...compromising positions with a couple of buckle bunnies. Naturally, their phones had cameras and they caught the whole raunchy performance on video. Which they posted on YouTube. Get this: He\u2019s already got a huge fan club, but since this happened, his PR woman can\u2019t keep up with the media requests for interviews. The women are freakin\u2019 out about seein\u2019 the almighty, bull riding great Chase McKay...buck-assed nekkid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019ve heard of it. What\u2019s Chase doin\u2019 about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLapping up the media attention like the whoremonger bad boy he is. Which means the idiot is still goin\u2019 out every night, getting drunk and getting laid. I ain\u2019t upset he pissed away the world finals by getting on a bull he had no business getting on, but if he doesn\u2019t take his rehab seriously, he\u2019s gonna end up with a permanent injury.\u201d</p><p>Brandt believed Chase would get his shit together, but he also understood Ben\u2019s concern for his little brother. \u201cTell said you guys are headed to Vegas for the NFR?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I hadn\u2019t planned on goin\u2019, but since Tell is doin\u2019 the judges course, I can stay with him. Plus, Chase is gonna be there, and he\u2019s so fucking scrambled he wants to talk to the PRCA folks about what they\u2019ll do for him if he switches to the PRCA bull riding program. Quinn can\u2019t go beat some sense into him because Libby has her hands full with Adam and Amelia, so I\u2019ve been drafted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Quinn needs help while you\u2019re gone, have him holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI better head out. Thanks for the beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Anytime you need to bend my ear again just come on by. Quinn\u2019s preoccupied with Libby and the kids these days, and Chase is never around. I spend most of my day talkin\u2019 to the damn cattle or my dogs, so I appreciate you stopping by.\u201d</p><p>Brandt never considered that Ben might be lonely. God knew he\u2019d be lonely if Tell and Dalton suddenly developed other interests. \u201cWill you be around for poker night? It\u2019s at Cord\u2019s, which means we\u2019ll have good eats while he\u2019s kickin\u2019 our ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sly fucker won eighty bucks from me last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s some advice for you, cuz. Stay away from the poker tables while you\u2019re in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your poker face is for shit.\u201d</p><p>Ben smirked. \u201cOr maybe that\u2019s just what I want you guys to think.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Jessie was chopping green peppers for the batch of Spanish rice when Brandt pulled up. He\u2019d been gone longer than she expected. But she wouldn\u2019t grill him about it because she remembered how crazy Luke got if she\u2019d asked him too many questions.</p><p>Brandt is not Luke.</p><p>No kidding. She\u2019d barely scratched the surface on learning what made Brandt tick.</p><p>Sex, definitely. Lots of sex. Lots of juicy, hot, mind-blowing sex.</p><p>Brandt stepped into the tiny entryway to take off his coat, boots and hat. In that order. Then he looked at her with the dimpled smile that made her belly flutter. \u201cHey. That smells good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust Spanish rice, nothing fancy.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the living room. \u201cLandon asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I know it\u2019s probably crazy to put him down this late, but he was really crabby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t here to help. I ended up stopping at Ben\u2019s place on the way home and we had a couple of beers.\u201d</p><p>Jessie smiled, appreciating he\u2019d told her his whereabouts. \u201cNo need to explain, but I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d</p><p>Brandt crossed into the kitchen, lowering his mouth to hers for a blistering kiss. He tasted of beer and need.</p><p>This sweet, hot man could wind her up in no time flat. She returned his kiss with equal fervor, loving his deep groan as she pressed her body to his and twined her arms around his neck. She felt him harden against her belly. Then Brandt clamped his hands on her butt, hoisting her up so her legs circled his hips.</p><p>He walked to the bedroom, breaking the liplock as he set her on the bed. \u201cDamn, woman, kissing you almost makes me forget I have a splitting headache.\u201d</p> <p>His face was pale. And his eyes had that squinty look she associated with pain. Any thoughts of getting nekkid with him vanished. \u201cWould you like me to rub your neck to see if it\u2019ll help your headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d She laid her hand on his cheek. His skin seemed hotter than normal. \u201cWhile you strip down to more comfy clothes, I\u2019ll throw the peppers in the pan and be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Brandt must be in pain if he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>In the kitchen, Jessie scooped the diced peppers into the hamburger and tomato mixture. She added a cup of rice before putting the lid on and turning the burner to low. After washing her hands, she checked on Landon and returned to the bedroom.</p> <p>Oh. Lordy. Would you look at that? A half-naked, muscled cowboy hottie stretched out on her bed.</p><p>Brandt had taken her strip down suggestion literally; he only wore his boxers.</p><p>He turned his head as she climbed on the bed. \u201cI probably oughta be givin\u2019 you a neck rub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given me plenty of backrubs. It\u2019s payback.\u201d She sat on his butt, tucking her knees by his sides. \u201cMind if I sit like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no. If you don\u2019t mind knowin\u2019 that you sittin\u2019 on me like that is gonna give me wood.</p><p>Guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and splayed her hands across his upper shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAh, sweet Jesus, Jess, that feels so damn good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClose your eyes and relax, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>He muttered, \u201cBossy thing,\u201d and rested the side of his face on the bed.</p><p>Jessie worked his shoulders, digging her thumbs into knotted muscles. His headache probably stemmed from the tight points all over his back, not just his neck. She attempted to loosen them, paying particular attention to the area around his spine.</p><p>She let herself enjoy touching him, her hands pulling, pushing and smoothing his skin. The musculature of his back had ridges and dips and hollows, forged from hours of physical labor he did every day. Yet that same flesh was pliant. It gave way beneath her kneading fingertips. And the scent of his skin... God, she wanted to bury her nose between his shoulder blades and fill her lungs with all that masculine goodness. Rub her face against his taut flesh, wearing the scent of his skin on hers. Press her lips to his spine and follow the length with her tongue down to his tailbone, tasting his heat and sweat.</p><p>Brandt exhaled a contented sigh.</p><p>That sigh emboldened her. She gently turned his head to reach the other side of his neck, resting her hands around the base of his throat, working her thumbs from his nape to his hairline. In that position, Jessie had to squeeze her thighs against his side as she leaned over him.</p><p>She had no idea how long she\u2019d been lost in massaging him, when a rumbling sound vibrated the fingers on his throat.</p><p>Maybe that noise was his polite way of telling her she\u2019d been pressing too hard.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It feels so goddamn good. Too good if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Ah. He was hard. Because she\u2019d been touching him. A sense of feminine power arose and she nuzzled his ear. \u201cI could work that muscle too.\u201d</p><p>Brandt chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I could do more.\u201d She teased his earlobe with her teeth, causing him to groan. \u201cLet me touch you. Let me wrap my hand around your cock and get you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Why did he sound so surprised? \u201cReally.\u201d Jessie swung her leg over his left side so she no longer straddled him. \u201cLift up so I can take your boxers off.\u201d</p><p>He pushed up and she slid her hand across his belly, making sure the head of his penis didn\u2019t catch in the elastic waistband.</p><p>Jessie impulsively placed a kiss on each of his butt cheeks. \u201cMy God. All that time in the saddle does amazing things for your butt. I always knew you looked good in Wranglers? But cowboy? You look even better out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been eyeing my ass?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cQuite a bit in the last month, truthfully. Lay on your side. Now reach up and grab the headboard with your left hand. Good. Put your right palm flat on the mattress and brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally brace myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Jessie grabbed the lube off the dresser and liberally coated her right hand. As she stretched out behind him, she wished she\u2019d stripped because she couldn\u2019t get enough of that delicious skin-to-skin sensation. She layered her left arm alongside his, gripping his wrist to anchor herself. Then she reached her right hand over his hip and curled her fingers around the root of his cock, while kissing the slope of his shoulder.</p><p>Brandt sucked in a quick breath.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you like it. Slow and teasing like this?\u201d She slid her slippery hand from the base to the tip, sweeping the pad of her thumb under the sweet spot on the upstroke. \u201cOr fast like this?\u201d Keeping her hand a tight fist, she moved up and down the length rapidly.</p><p>\u201cJesus. That feels amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast it is.\u201d</p><p>He groaned, \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d when she found the right rhythm and speed.</p><p>Jessie kissed his nape while she stroked him, pleased how the skin on his arms broke out in goose flesh beneath her questing lips. She explored the tendons in his neck with her tongue. Her teeth grazed the ball of his shoulder and he twitched, head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWoman you\u2019re killin\u2019 me. I\u2019m not gonna last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to last. I want you to come.\u201d She increased her tempo, and immediately his butt muscles clenched against the cradle of her hips.</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold out on me, Brandt. I wanna feel your cock jerking beneath my fingers. Give it up for me.\u201d</p><p>He came with a low grunt, hips bucking as he spurted into her hand.</p><p>Jessie continued to squeeze his cock, kissing his back, wondering what to do with her sticky hand.</p><p>Brandt rolled over and handed her his boxers. \u201cHere. Use these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She discreetly wiped her hand and tossed his underwear toward the hamper. \u201cIs your headache gone now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them is.\u201d Brandt managed a small smile but a hint of pain lingered in his eyes. \u201cThanks, Jess.</p><p>I should return the favor\u2014\u201d</p><p>Slightly annoyed, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t touch you because I wanted something in return, Brandt. I did it because touching you any way I please makes me happy. Very happy.\u201d Jessie placed a kiss above his heart.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes because I can see that headache is dogging you.\u201d</p><p>Landon woke up in a better mood. He\u2019d gotten less picky with food, and ate some of the hamburger and rice, a slice of bread and half a can of mandarin oranges. The instant he was out of his high chair, he shrieked, \u201cGoggie!\u201d and made a beeline for Lexie, who allowed Landon to pet and hug her...for about two minutes.</p><p>Jessie was hungry but she waited for Brandt. She did mundane things, started a load of clothes, scoured the highchair tray, let Lexie outside. Then let Lexie back inside, trying to keep Landon from opening the door and following the dog.</p><p>Thinking she had a minute to rest, Jessie sat on the couch. Right away Landon scrambled beside her, dragging his new fleece blanket from Grandma Joan and his favorite book about farm animals.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to read to you?\u201d</p><p>Landon blinked at her.</p><p>She held up the book. \u201cIf you want me to read this, Landon, say yes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo way, lil\u2019 buckaroo. You\u2019re not getting away with that nonverbal communication stuff so young. Say yes.\u201d</p><p>His fingers worried the fringe on the blanket and stared at her pitifully, but he didn\u2019t utter a peep.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fine. If you don\u2019t wanna read the book...\u201d Jessie set the book on the coffee table. She hated to play hardball, but Landon needed to work on his verbal skills, rather than grunting, pointing and shrieking to get what he wanted.</p><p>He yelled, \u201cNo!\u201d and scooted off the couch, grabbing the book and shoving it at Jessie.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this for a while, Landon. Do you want me to read the book? Then say yes.\u201d</p><p>She said \u201cYes\u201d as she nodded her head.</p><p>Landon nodded and said, \u201cYef.\u201d</p><p>Jessie clapped. \u201cYes! Yay Landon! See? You can talk. You just need someone to force you to do it.\u201d</p><p>She opened the book. Before she read a single word, Landon crawled into her lap, blanket under one arm as he cuddled against her.</p><p>Her heart turned over. Landon\u2019s unexpected sweetness and neediness had the power to undo her from her just another daycare kid mindset. So it seemed natural to brush her lips across the top of his dark head.</p><p>She read, \u201cFarmer George has one cow.\u201d She stopped. \u201cHeh, he\u2019s not much of a rancher is he, with only one cow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and continued reading. \u201cBut Farmer George has lost his cow. Can you help him find it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pointed on the page to a cow hiding in the bushes. \u201cRemember what a cow says? Mmmoooo.\u201d She drew out the word until it was about ten seconds long.</p><p>Landon giggled.</p><p>\u201cNow Landon\u2014\u201d she poked his chest when she said his name, \u201c\u2014say mmmoooo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmoooo.\u201d</p><p>Jessie clapped again. \u201cGood job! You are gonna know all your barnyard noises in no time flat.\u201d</p><p>Usually Landon lost interest before they reached the end of a book, but tonight he stuck it out, although he was pretty squirmy at the end. When she closed the cover, Landon launched himself off the couch and ran straight to Brandt.</p><p>How long had he been lurking in the shadows? And why was she thinking it was a damn crying shame that he\u2019d gotten dressed?</p><p>\u201cUp!\u201d Landon demanded.</p> <p>But Brandt wasn\u2019t looking at Landon. He was looking at her with the softest expression. He broke eye contact when Landon bumped into his leg with another demanding, \u201cUp!\u201d and lifted the boy. \u201cSo I missed story time? Bummer.\u201d</p><p>Landon said, \u201cMmmoooo.\u201d</p><p>Brandt grinned. \u201cThat\u2019ll come in handy when you\u2019re ridin\u2019 the range with us in a few years, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Jessie ignored Brandt\u2019s confident in a few years remark and asked, \u201cIs your headache better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely gone. Did you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I was waiting for you.\u201d Damn. Did that sound...needy?</p> <p>Why are you so worried about Brandt\u2019s reaction? He\u2019s proven time and time again he\u2019s not like Luke.</p><p>\u201cThank you for waitin\u2019, Jess. I\u2019ve eaten enough meals alone to last a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>There was proof of Brandt\u2019s openness. His willingness to just say what he felt. Jessie met his gaze again. \u201cMe too. I\u2019ll dish up the plates.\u201d</p><p>Brandt strapped Landon in his high chair and poured him a sippy cup of milk. Then he set six animal crackers on the tray.</p><p>They waited to see how he\u2019d react. Sometimes Landon calmly gummed his cookies and sipped milk.</p><p>Other times he\u2019d use the heavy bottom weight of the cup to smash the cookies into dust. If he was feeling ornery, or if he was tired, he\u2019d slide his hand on the tray until he knocked every cookie to the floor. Then he\u2019d usually whip the sippy cup too, and scream \u201cNo!\u201d at the top of his lungs, arching his back, trying to throw himself out of the high chair.</p><p>Tonight Landon used both hands to drink and ignored the cookies.</p><p>Brandt tucked into his food. About five or six bites in, Jessie noticed he\u2019d picked out all the green peppers and piled them off to the side. Feeling her curious gaze, he looked up. \u201cWhat? Am I eatin\u2019 like a pig or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but you should\u2019ve told me you didn\u2019t like green peppers.\u201d She realized she\u2019d put green peppers in a lot of dishes. \u201cI could\u2019ve left them out of everything.\u201d</p><p>His neck flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal to eat around them. Especially when everything you fix is so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmer. Anything else you don\u2019t like, foodwise, as long as we\u2019re on the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurnips, parsnips, radishes, beets, prunes, collard greens, Dijon mustard, strawberry ice cream. I could take or leave coconut. Same for cauliflower.\u201d</p><p>Jessie stared at him. \u201cSo a fall soup with root vegetables isn\u2019t a good idea?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNope. But if you made it I\u2019d probably eat it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to hurt my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because any kind of food just seems to taste better when I\u2019m eatin\u2019 it with you.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes the man was just so damn sweet.</p><p>Before she could formulate a decent response, Landon shrieked, \u201cGoggie!\u201d</p><p>Jessie attributed Lexie warming to Landon because the kid was a messy eater. The dog would park herself beside the high chair and clean up the floor as soon as Landon was done.</p><p>So why was she hearing crunch crunch crunch now?</p><p>Landon peered over the side of the tray at the dog and giggled. Then he grabbed another animal cracker and tossed it at Lexie.</p><p>Crunch crunch crunch and another giggle.</p><p>Brandt lifted his brows. \u201cThat\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Looks like Lexie will be elsewhere during meals because Landon will give goggie all his food in hopes she\u2019ll be his BFF.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least he hasn\u2019t figured out how to get the lid off his cup yet.\u201d</p><p>She jabbed her fork at him. \u201cAnd you, Brandt McKay, have just jinxed us.\u201d</p><p>Landon\u2019s shrieks escalated when he ran out of cookies. Brandt ate the last bite on his plate and stood.</p><p>\u201cOkay, partner. You and me got a date with bubbles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He unclipped the tray and set it on the counter.</p><p>\u201cYef,\u201d Landon repeated.</p><p>Brandt looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s new too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope what I\u2019ve been doing helps him. He\u2019s a little old for grunting and pointing to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>He swung Landon onto his hip and smirked.</p><p>A smirk she recognized. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you reduced me to earlier. A grunting fool and you gave me exactly what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrown men really do have the same mentality as seventeen month old toddlers.\u201d</p><p>Brandt grinned and headed to the bathroom.</p><p>Jessie cleaned up the kitchen and made four bottles. Landon was already down two bottles for the day, compared to the six he\u2019d started with. Bath time had gotten better, but the kid really didn\u2019t like getting wet.</p><p>She heard Brandt\u2019s muffled voice and splashing as she passed by the bathroom. In her bedroom she noticed Brandt had draped his clothes over the top of the dresser, instead of leaving them piled on the floor.</p><p>Another sign of his thoughtful nature\u2014he didn\u2019t expect her to clean up after him.</p><p>She slipped on a camisole and her favorite pair of yoga pants. Granted, she hadn\u2019t attempted yoga, but she figured the pants were the best part anyway. She glanced longingly at the bed Brandt had recently occupied, rumpled sheets and the pillow held the indent of his head.</p><p>God. She\u2019d missed having a warm male body beside her. Luke hadn\u2019t been snuggly, so it thrilled her that Brandt slept entangled with her all night. Every night. Without exception. She\u2019d stopped wearing pajama bottoms to bed because Brandt kept her plenty warm. Plus, it was handy when he woke her up to have his wicked way with her.</p><p>Powerful stuff, how much he always wanted her. Even now, the thought of his ragged breath teasing her nape, or his mouth tasting the line of her shoulder, or his rough hands stroking her arms, her belly, and her breasts made her wet and achy. There was an odd sort of comfort in the way he touched her in the wee small hours. Almost like a compulsion. An addiction. Sometimes he\u2019d just caress her with a feather light touch until she was ready to crawl out of her skin.</p><p>Other times he\u2019d start kissing her neck and keep moving south until his mouth was between her thighs. Definitely erotic, feeling him sucking and licking her sex when she couldn\u2019t see his head beneath the covers and she was still floaty in that morning sleep haze.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed when she looked at him, standing in the doorway with Landon on his hip. \u201cAh.</p><p>What? I was just changing.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. He knew exactly what she\u2019d been thinking about. And to add fuel to the fire, his gaze idly drifted over her, head to toe, with a blast of heat strong enough that she had to hold on to the dresser to keep from jumping him.</p><p>Landon grunted, breaking their connection. \u201cAnyway, what did you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNail clippers. Landon\u2019s fingernails and toenails are like claws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d She couldn\u2019t resist kissing Landon\u2019s damp, rosy cheek as she passed by him. She couldn\u2019t resist pressing her mouth to Brandt\u2019s full lips.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s eyes held pure pleasure. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say, For turning me on in more ways than I ever dreamed possible. Instead, she just gave him the same kind of smirk he\u2019d given her.</p><p>Despite his late nap, Landon was tired and Brandt put him down at his usual time. She was in the kitchen, flipping through a cookbook, when Brandt moved in behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s cookin\u2019? Need any help heatin\u2019 things up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny. I\u2019m looking for a recipe for a pear tart. I\u2019ve got all these ripe pears I need to use up.</p><p>And you seem to like sweet stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I can think of one sweet thing in particular I like to eat. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Jessie blushed.</p><p>\u201cI love it when you blush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it gives me some color and I don\u2019t look so pasty white.\u201d</p><p>Brandt slapped her butt. \u201cDon\u2019t say shit like that or I will spank you and turn your other cheeks red.</p><p>It\u2019s sexy as hell how you\u2019ll let me do anything to your body that I want, but if I talk about it, you blush. But since you\u2019re usually dressed when I\u2019m teasin\u2019 you, I wanna know if that blush covers your whole body.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the section of skin below her ear. \u201cSo let\u2019s find out. Take your pants off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t possibly be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m completely serious. And if you don\u2019t take them off, I will.\u201d He nipped her ear. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. You\u2019ve got about three seconds.\u201d</p><p>Heart pounding, Jessie peeled down the yoga pants and kicked them aside.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cGood to see you\u2019re goin\u2019 commando now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence on me, Brandt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ.\u201d His fingers traced the bottom edge of her lacy camisole, from the left side of her waist to the right side, causing her belly muscles to ripple inside and out. He gripped the edges and said,</p><p>\u201cLift your arms,\u201d removing her camisole.</p><p>It was weird standing buck-ass nekkid in her kitchen, especially since Brandt was fully clothed. She started to turn around, but he boxed her in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay like this.\u201d He slid her hands to the edge of the countertop, slipping his knee between her legs in a signal to widen her stance. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Jess?\u201d</p> <p>It took about ten seconds, but she nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Close your eyes. Relax.\u201d</p><p>She let her eyes drift shut, but she was in no way relaxed. His body shifted as he reached for something on the counter. Then his wonderfully rough hand glided down her bare stomach, stopping to cover her mound. His fingers stroked her cleft, teasing her folds until she felt herself growing wet, heavy with need.</p><p>His fingers vanished. Before she could protest, a cool, round object connected with her clit and she gasped, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fair peeking. Keep your eyes closed.\u201d Brandt steadily dragged it up and down her slit in a smooth glide that followed the contour of her sex from top to bottom. He whispered, \u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His lips feathered hot, moist kisses across her neck. He circled her clit, never too hard, or too soft, exacting the ideal amount of pressure to keep her wanting more. Then he\u2019d slide it down to the juncture of her thighs, using her slick juices to slide back up.</p><p>Jessie noticed the rounded object was no longer cool, but warmed from friction against her body. It didn\u2019t feel as hard. It\u2019d become soft, pliable.</p><p>\u201cImagine this is my cock riding your slit.\u201d He arced it from the opening of her body, up to the top of her pubic bone. Each stroke faster. Shorter. His breath stirred her hair and she had no problem imagining it was Brandt\u2019s cock gently driving her toward orgasm.</p><p>On the next upstroke, he brought that mysterious object up the center of her torso, between her cleavage, over the column of her throat to rest on her lips. She felt the stickiness of her juices, not only on her mouth, but in a trail from her chin to her bikini line.</p><p>Brandt growled in her ear. \u201cLick it.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie\u2019s tongue darted out and she lapped up the taste of her own musky essence from the warm and rounded slope.</p><p>\u201cBite down.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth sank in, and the sweet, earthy taste of pear juice burst in her mouth. A moan escaped as she sucked at the fruit, greedily biting off a chunk of perfect ripeness. The flesh nearly melted against her tongue. The fruit flowed down her throat as she swallowed, but more juice spilled from her lips and dripped over her chin as she stole another juicy bite. And another. And another.</p><p>Brandt plucked the fruit away, spun her around and fused their mouths together. The taste of Brandt exploded on her tongue, mixing with the sweetness of the pear and the hint of her own juices. He sucked at her tongue, licking the soft depths of her mouth, guiding them to a new level of lust just with his potent kiss.</p><p>And then he gently pressed that squishy, sticky fruit to the top of her pubic bone until pear juice trickled down her cleft in a syrupy stream and dampened her thighs.</p><p>Jessie gasped at the sensation, breaking the kiss.</p><p>Brandt growled, leaving sucking kisses on the sticky trail down her body. He fell to his knees and buried his face in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cBrandt! Oh God.\u201d Jessie\u2019s fingers scrabbled for purchase on the counter behind her as she attempted to hold on against his sensual assault.</p> <p>Brandt\u2019s thumbs pulled the skin back to expose her clit. He lapped the juices\u2014hers and the pear\u2019s\u2014</p><p>like a junkie. Thoroughly tasting every inch of her while that rumbling noise in his throat that vibrated against her swollen tissues.</p><p>When he switched to those flickering butterfly licks, she was toast. Her body shook with every orgasmic pulse. She might\u2019ve gasped. Actually, she might\u2019ve screamed. But she mostly couldn\u2019t hear anything over the blood pounding in ears that mimicked the throbbing goodness pounding in her groin.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been embarrassing, how quickly she\u2019d started to come after Brandt put his mouth on her, but the orgasm was so incredibly volatile that any lucid thought beyond Yes! Yes! Yes! didn\u2019t register at all.</p><p>Only when Brandt started kissing her quivering thighs did she float back to earth. She peeled her lids open and peered down at him.</p><p>Maybe she expected he\u2019d be munching on the leftover chunk of pear with a gleam in his eye. But he had an even wilder look to him.</p><p>Keeping his fiery gaze on her, he ditched his sweatpants and smothered her mouth in another controlling kiss as he brought them down to the floor.</p><p>There were no sweet words. No asking permission. As Brandt scrambled her brain with savage kisses, he settled between her thighs, hiked her hips up and plunged inside her.</p><p>His lower body pumped into hers, and he attempted to pin her arms over her head, but Jessie twisted free of his grip, digging her nails into his ass as her legs circled his waist. Keeping him exactly where she wanted him.</p><p>Brandt slammed into her harder. Pushed her higher off the floor. The kiss became impossible to sustain, given the ferocity of his thrusts.</p><p>She canted her pelvis, changing his angle of entry so his every plunge brushed her clit. She hissed,</p><p>\u201cYes. Like that.\u201d</p><p>He grunted, flexing his hips with enough velocity they skidded across the linoleum.</p><p>Jessie knew he was close, knew she needed to send him over in order to reach that pinnacle herself.</p><p>She dragged her nails down his sweat-covered back, loving how the tactile sensation and the hint of pain always surprised him. Always drove him wild. Immediately his whole body shuddered as he started to come, bucking against her forcefully.</p><p>Brandt threw his head back and roared. God he was magnificent. Pure male animal.</p><p>Her interior muscles took over, tightening around his shaft, pushing her to the place where those rhythmic pulses reverberated throughout her entire being. She had the fleeting thought that this could easily become her sole reason for living\u2014to find this sheer pleasure with this man. And she might\u2019ve started speaking in tongues, because god knew she\u2019d definitely been singing this man\u2019s praises, even if it sounded like gibberish.</p><p>His deep thrusts slowed. But didn\u2019t stop. Brandt buried his face in her neck and panted, still pumping into her. It was almost like he couldn\u2019t stop. Couldn\u2019t bear to break their connection.</p><p>Jessie ran her palms down his back of his flawlessly rounded butt cheeks. She pressed down in a silent signal for him to stop.</p><p>He lifted his head. His eyes were still wild.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>But Brandt didn\u2019t return her smile, nor did he bestow those yummy post-orgasm kisses she hungered for. No. A look of shock flitted through his eyes and he abruptly moved off her. So abruptly that his ass hit the floor. Hard. He jammed his hand across his scalp in a move that looked like he was adjusting his hat.</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...give me a second, okay?\u201d</p><p>She pushed up on her elbows and let her toes slide up his shin. \u201cYou out of breath or something?\u201d</p><p>His gaze swept over her body. Almost clinically. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would you ask me that?\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked away.</p><p>Jessie reached up and grabbed his chin, forcing his gaze back to her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Jesus, Jessie. Because I lost it. Completely. I took you down and fucked you on the kitchen floor, for Christsake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She stretched provocatively because she loved the way his focus immediately zoomed to her breasts. \u201cYou always mention my floor is clean enough to eat off of, why wouldn\u2019t it be okay to fuck on?\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her.</p><p>Oh hell no. Was that...regret in his eyes?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t piss me off, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich brings up the question why aren\u2019t you pissed off at me for attacking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I liked it. Actually, I loved it. Not only did I love that I made you lose control, I loved the fact you were so hot to have me right then, that you didn\u2019t stop what you were doing, you didn\u2019t second guess what you were feeling, you didn\u2019t feel guilty. No. You fucked me on the floor. Hard and dirty. It was fucking spectacular and I don\u2019t regret a single second.\u201d</p><p>When he continued to wear that hangdog expression, she\u2019d had enough. She started to get up, but Brandt brought her back down. Two hundred odd pounds of cowboy pinned her to the floor and got right in her face.</p><p>\u201cFor the record, that was the hottest sex ever. Ever. No regrets, Jessie. Just lookin\u2019 at you calms me.</p><p>But just lookin\u2019 at you also revs me up.\u201d</p><p>She touched his face, letting the tips of her fingers follow that strong jawline. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear even when I know it\u2019s hard for you to admit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? I\u2019ve known you for four years. I\u2019ve seen that dark look in your eye and then you come back a day or two later bloody and bruised. I don\u2019t fault you for not wanting me to see that side of you, but I\u2019m fully aware it\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>He rested his forehead to hers. \u201cYou have no idea what it means to me to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do.\u201d She touched her lips to his in a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed with me, Jess,\u201d he murmured in her hair. \u201cLet me show you my other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I think I might be stuck to the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry.\u201d Brandt rolled and brought her to her feet. \u201cShower first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Halfway down the hallway she snickered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it ironic that I have pear-scented soap?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cI really wish you\u2019d reconsider and stay here for Thanksgiving, Jess. The roads in Wyoming ain\u2019t the best this time of year and I don\u2019t want you to get stranded someplace.\u201d</p><p>Jessie set her duffel bag by the door and snagged her winter coat off the coat rack. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019ll be easier for everyone if I\u2019m with my family. Besides, it\u2019s only three days.\u201d Driving to her mom\u2019s was preferable to staying by herself when Brandt took Landon to his parent\u2019s on Thanksgiving Day\u2014since she hadn\u2019t been issued an invite. She\u2019d spent last Thanksgiving alone, eating a microwaved turkey and dressing meal, watching reruns of holiday classics and bawling her eyes out about the pathetic state of her life. An experience she\u2019d rather not repeat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandt sighed. \u201cAin\u2019t no talkin\u2019 you out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She buttoned her coat and slipped on her gloves. \u201cJust double check that everything is shut off before you leave. I\u2019ll call you when I get there, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But first...c\u2019mere and give me some sugar.\u201d He curled his fingers around her lapels and tugged her closer.</p> <p>Then he proceeded to turn her inside out with one of his long, drugging kisses, chock-full of passion, sweetness and heat. Boy howdy did Brandt\u2019s kisses pack a wallop. Her knees and her will went weak.</p><p>Until he chuckled against the corner of her mouth. \u201cYou sure that didn\u2019t change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She backed up and he released her. She reached for the duffel bag strap but Brandt firmly knocked her hand away and picked it up. She still wasn\u2019t used to all his gentlemanly quirks, but she really liked them.</p><p>But you could get used to them, couldn\u2019t you?</p><p>Yes.</p> <p>She opened her truck door and whistled. Lexie\u2019s furry body was a blur as she leapt into the cab. Her tail wagged so hard it left wet prints on the passenger window.</p><p>Brandt hoisted the duffel into the truck bed. \u201cLandon is gonna miss Lexie the next few days. Did you say goodbye to him?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how Landon would take it, given he sometimes screamed when Jessie left him with Brandt or vice versa. The last thing Brandt needed was a cranky, confused toddler. But Jessie suspected Brandt wouldn\u2019t see the logic in her decision not to give Landon an official goodbye, to tell him to be a Lorelei James</p><p>good boy and all that parenting stuff, especially since she wasn\u2019t his parent. Yet, she didn\u2019t want Brandt to think she didn\u2019t care because she was starting to care too much and that scared the holy bejeezus out of her.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze snapped to his. \u201cSorry. Give him a kiss for me, okay? I\u2019ve gotta get on the road.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll drive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll call me as soon as you\u2019re at your mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>It was so sweet he worried about her. Had Luke ever obsessively worried about her like this? Not that she remembered. She smiled at him. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Brandt kissed her again. \u201cHave a Happy Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Brandt.\u201d She slammed the door and backed out of her driveway. The last thing she saw as she turned the corner onto the main road was Brandt still standing on her steps, watching her go.</p><p>Luke definitely had never done that.</p><p>The drive from Moorcroft to Riverton was uneventful, with the exception of sporadic snow flurries drifting across the road. By the time she\u2019d reached her mother\u2019s house, both she and Lexie were ready to get out of the truck. She texted Brandt rather than calling him.</p> <p>When Jessie saw her mom standing in the doorway, she had the urge to run straight into her arms, like she had as a child. So it was no surprise to either of them she did exactly that.</p><p>Her mom hugged her tightly. \u201cJessie! It\u2019s so good to see you. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d No matter where they\u2019d ended up living as she was growing up, her mom carried the scents Jessie associated with home; coffee, Aqua Net hairspray, double mint gum and Jergen\u2019s cherry-almond lotion. She inhaled deeply and sighed, happy that some things never changed.</p><p>\u201cCome in. I\u2019ve got a pot of coffee ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m wired enough as it is.\u201d Jessie kicked off her boots, ditched her coat, hat and gloves.</p><p>Then she wiped Lexie\u2019s paws. Her mom didn\u2019t mind pets in the house just as long as she didn\u2019t have to clean muddy paw prints out of her carpet.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Roger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the college. He\u2019ll be here later. He\u2019s trying to catch up on paperwork so he can have the whole weekend off.\u201d</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t really know her mother\u2019s husband Roger Randolph very well. They\u2019d met through the community college in Wheatland where he taught and she worked as an administrative assistant. By that time Jessie already lived on her own. Then she\u2019d met Luke, married him and moved to the McKay ranch.</p><p>About six months before Luke died, her mom and Roger had relocated to Riverton. Roger was a nice enough guy, and he seemed to make her mother happy, so that\u2019s all that mattered. \u201cIs Josie coming?\u201d</p><p>That gave her mother pause. \u201cNo. You haven\u2019t talked to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t exactly keep me on speed dial.\u201d Jessie\u2019s sister, Josie, had inherited her father\u2019s wanderlust. After years spent waiting for Billy to get off the road, her mother had finally divorced him the year Jessie turned twelve. The sad thing was, it hadn\u2019t affected Jessie\u2019s life because Billy hadn\u2019t been around much anyway.</p><p>But it\u2019d affected Josie. Josie had romanticized her father and his lifestyle, so she took off right after she\u2019d turned eighteen. It\u2019d been a hard blow to their mother, and for that Jessie resented her younger sister.</p><p>Any close relationship they shared vanished when Josie did.</p><p>\u201cI talked to her last month,\u201d her mom said. \u201cShe\u2019s working at a restaurant in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>No big stunner Josie was in cowboy country in Texas. Jessie couldn\u2019t muster interest in Josie\u2019s latest escapade and refused to pretend. She also refused to mention to her mother she\u2019d seen Billy because she doubted she could be civil about him, either.</p><p>She wandered into the kitchen and snatched an oatmeal raisin cookie. Her eyes nearly bugged out at the three different kinds of pie, and cinnamon rolls, and brownies, and two different types of cookies\u2014all homemade\u2014that crowded the countertop.</p><p>\u201cYou want milk with that?\u201d</p><p>Milk. Right. Jessie smiled. \u201cNope. I\u2019d rather have a beer.\u201d She helped herself to one from the fridge.</p><p>\u201cDo you have time to sit down? Or are you still whipping up food for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mostly done. Gotta get up and put the turkey in, glaze the hamballs and peel the potatoes, but I figured you could help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. How many people are you feeding?\u201d She took a long pull off the Corona.</p><p>\u201cEight. Our friends Barb and Tim, our empty nest neighbors Rich and his wife Dawn, and Roger\u2019s new teaching assistant, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Jessie slowly lowered the bottle. \u201cMom. Please tell me you\u2019re not trying to fix me up with this Jake guy.\u201d</p><p>Her mother grabbed a dishrag and wiped cookie crumbs from the counter. \u201cNot a fix up. But Jake is a really great guy. He\u2019s single, so are you. You\u2019re around the same age, I thought it\u2019d be good for you to have someone show you around while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Regardless of what her mom claimed, this was a fix up. Although she and Brandt were exclusive while they were living together, this thing, whatever it was, was temporary.</p><p>You don\u2019t really believe that. There\u2019s more going on between you and Brandt than just hot sex. This thing could be the start of something big.</p><p>But her cynical side reminded her that there already was something very big between her and Brandt, something insurmountable: Landon\u2019s future.</p><p>\u201cJessie?\u201d her mother prompted. \u201cI see the wheels turning. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact I\u2019m currently helping my former brother-in-law take care of my dead husband\u2019s secret love child from a jailbait jailbird? Oh, and just to make it even more interesting, I\u2019m now sleeping with said brother in law.\u201d</p><p>After her mom picked her jaw up off the floor, she pointed to a dining room chair. \u201cSit and start talking. I\u2019ll get more beer.\u201d</p><p>Jessie knew her mother intended to grill her when she ditched her apron, embroidered with a big \u201cL\u201d</p><p>for Lisa. Removal of the apron indicated the shift in parental roles from cookie and comfort giver to interrogator. She sipped her beer and waited for the barrage of questions.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cDid you end up in this situation with Brandt out of guilt?\u201d Her mother raised her hand when Jessie began to object. \u201cI know you\u2019re in the situation with Landon out of some obligation you feel to Luke.\u201d</p><p>Jessie ran her thumb along the edge of the sandstone coaster as she tried to figure out a way to explain it, when half the time she didn\u2019t understand it herself. \u201cBeing in such close quarters with Brandt felt different from the start. That everyday familiarity between us built pretty damn fast and in some ways, it was more intimate than sex. I missed that physical closeness, and since we were already acting like a married couple, I told him I wanted all of the benefits of being married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you approached him?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jessie swallowed a mouthful of beer. \u201cHard to believe, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you did. At least you\u2019re getting something you want out of this lousy situation. How you\u2019re able to handle...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if one of Billy\u2019s floozies would\u2019ve shown up with a kid he\u2019d fathered.\u201d</p><p>Her mom hadn\u2019t spoken of Billy\u2019s infidelities, but Jessie knew it\u2019d been another reason she\u2019d ended the marriage. Before she could answer, her mother laughed.</p><p>\u201cSee, I say that, but I probably would\u2019ve done the exact same thing you did, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Caved in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She leaned back in her chair. \u201cIn some ways hearing about Landon\u2019s mother reminded me...well, kinda like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day when you were about sixteen months, I was at my wit\u2019s end, with you, with my job, and this neighbor lady volunteered to take care of you for a couple of hours while I got control. At first I thought it was weird, but she told me someone helped her out when she was a young mother and she was just returning the favor. Her kindness over the next few months really changed a lot for me. For us.\u201d</p><p>Jessie was floored. \u201cHow come I never knew any of this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHonestly? Because I\u2019d forgotten about it. So many other things happened over the years. It came back to me when you said you were helping out with Luke\u2019s kid. So no, you\u2019re not a doormat, Jessie. No matter what Luke led you to believe.\u201d</p><p>She killed her beer. \u201cLuke and I were headed for a divorce anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved him. I\u2019da done anything, let him get away with anything, been anyone he wanted me to be, just to keep him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that too, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>She held her fingers to her eyes to stem the tears. \u201cGod, Mom. I\u2019ve had time to think, a lot, too much time probably, but one of the hardest parts of losing Luke was figuring out I\u2019d lost myself too. I let him define me. And when he wasn\u2019t around to tell me who to be, I didn\u2019t know who the hell I was.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell and Jessie welcomed it.</p><p>Her mother cleared her throat. \u201cAnd what about Brandt McKay? Are you letting him define you?\u201d</p><p>Jessie shook her head. \u201cWhich might seem at odds with agreeing to help him take care of Landon. I\u2019m not doing it for Brandt. I\u2019m not even doing it for Luke. I\u2019m doing it for that little boy, no matter if Landon ever knows it, no matter how hard it is. He needs me. I\u2019ve already got a lot of regrets where Luke is concerned and I won\u2019t let ignoring this helpless kid be another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be able to let Landon go when the time comes?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>The door in the living room opened and Lexie started barking. Jessie grabbed her collar and issued a terse, \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the kitchen with Jessie, Roger.\u201d</p><p>Roger came through the door in stocking feet. Before he acknowledged Jessie, he gave her mother a kiss on the lips. More than a peck, less than dueling tongues, but a kiss filled with warmth and affection.</p><p>\u201cHey, you.\u201d Her mom smiled up at him, happiness shining in her smile and her eyes. Jessie fought those stupid tears again because if anyone deserved a man who adored her, it was her mother.</p><p>Roger kissed her one more time. \u201cHey yourself.\u201d Then he remembered Jessie was in the room. He adjusted his glasses. \u201cJessie. Nice to see you. I hope the roads were all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were fine.\u201d</p><p>Roger crouched down to pet Lexie, giving Jessie an opportunity to study him. He definitely looked like an accounting teacher with his white button up shirt, plaid cardigan, and khaki pants. Beneath his thick glasses were kind brown eyes, which were another indication of his gentle demeanor.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a glass of wine?\u201d her mother asked him.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll let you get back to girl talk.\u201d</p><p>Jessie stood. \u201cActually, I think I\u2019ll head to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to chase you off, Jessie,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d She swiped her mother\u2019s half-full bottle of beer. \u201cBesides, I think Mom would like that glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put your stuff in your usual room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Jessie wandered into the bedroom. The first time she\u2019d come to her mother\u2019s home after Luke had died, she\u2019d taken one look at the twin bed\u2014a blatant reminder of her single status\u2014and she\u2019d slid to the floor, weeping.</p><p>No urge to weep arose this time, but she had gotten used to sleeping with Brandt in the last few weeks, wrapping herself around his warm body after they\u2019d made love and before they drifted off. She\u2019d really gotten used to his unique way of waking her up.</p><p>She slipped on her pajamas. Lexie preferred tile to carpet, so she curled up on the floor in the adjoining bathroom.</p><p>Jessie slid beneath the sweet-smelling sheets and brought the down comforter under her chin. She turned on her side to get comfortable, squinting at the red numbers on the clock on the bedside table.</p><p>Eleven. Was Brandt tucked in bed? Or had he fallen asleep in front of the TV?</p><p>Ten minutes ticked away. Then twenty. She heard her mom and Roger moving down the hallway, followed by the click of their bedroom door closing.</p><p>Another fifteen minutes passed. Almost midnight. She should be tired. But she was wide-awake.</p><p>Her cell phone vibrated on the nightstand. Jessie snatched it and smiled at the caller ID: \u201cHey. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Brandt cleared his throat. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to scare ya, I just called because I...missed you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did a little flip. How sweet that he didn\u2019t think anything of calling her up just to tell her he missed her.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I woke you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t. I was just laying here staring at the ceiling, to be honest. Did you get my text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, was that what the \u2018I\u2019m here\u2019 meant? That you\u2019d arrived safe and sound in Riverton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. She\u2019s been baking and cooking all day. She\u2019s invited a few people over for dinner tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone you know?\u201d</p><p>Was she supposed to tell him about the single guy her mom had invited? No. Especially when she hadn\u2019t met the man yet. Not that Brandt would be jealous...would he?</p><p>Jessie had the perverse impulse to tell Brandt about her blind dinner date, just to see how he\u2019d react.</p><p>High schoolish, Jessie.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh sorry, no, I won\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m hopin\u2019 all her dinner guests are old couples and that she isn\u2019t tryin\u2019 to fix her single, hot daughter up with some guy.\u201d</p><p>Gulp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a flatterer, Brandt McKay. Hot daughter. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are hot. Smokin\u2019 hot,\u201d he whispered huskily. \u201cAnd if you were here, I\u2019d prove just how hot I think you are.\u201d</p><p>She rolled flat on her back and adjusted the phone. \u201cHow would you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kiss you. And once I had your focus totally on those long, wet kisses that make you whimper, I\u2019d start to unbutton your pajama top.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou are wearin\u2019 them long john ones you\u2019re so crazy about, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why? Would you rather I wore something sexier to bed?\u201d</p><p>Brandt growled. \u201cWhat\u2019s sexy is what\u2019s under whatever you\u2019re wearin\u2019, which is why I can\u2019t wait to peel it off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Keep going, cowboy. Then what would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce I had that shirt hangin\u2019 open, I\u2019d drag my palms down your chest until I had your breasts cupped in my hands. I\u2019d brush my thumbs across your nipples until they were tight points. Then I\u2019d put my mouth on them. Just my lips. I\u2019d nibble. Tease with those butterfly flicks that make you arch your back and moan. I might use my teeth. Test that edge of pain. I might get the tips wet and blow just to see hard I can get \u2019em. While my mouth was workin\u2019 you, my hands would be strokin\u2019 that soft curve where your heart is racing. By that time you\u2019ll be begging, grinding against me so I\u2019d suck your nipple until I had the whole thing in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>This was actually getting her worked up.</p><p>\u201cI heard that catch in your breath, Jessie. Is this turnin\u2019 you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself. Close your eyes and do everything I tell you. Imagine my hands, my breath, my mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>Her answering, \u201cOkay,\u201d came out in a breathy whisper.</p><p>Brandt made that low-pitched growl again. \u201cPinch your nipple.\u201d</p><p>Jessie switched the phone to her left hand and used the fingers on her right hand to twirl her right nipple into a tight peak.</p><p>\u201cIs it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your fingers in your mouth. Get them wet. Now twist the tips just to that edge of pain.\u201d</p><p>She did exactly as he asked, imagining Brandt\u2019s hands, and it shocked her that the fingers touching her nipples...didn\u2019t feel like her fingers.</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s sexy as hell, listening to those noises you make. Now loosen the drawstring on your pants just enough so you can slide your hand down there. Skim your fingers over your belly. Stop and stroke that sweet, soft section of skin between your hipbones. I love how your skin gets goose bumps when I touch you there.\u201d</p><p>Her flesh rippled. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow slip your finger beneath your panties. Follow the slit from the top to the bottom. Slowly.\u201d</p><p>Jessie let her index finger trace the rise of her pubic mound to the entrance to her sex.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Jessie. Are you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet your fingers play in that wetness, swirling it around. Then bring the tip of your finger up those soft pink folds and touch your clit. A little, not a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to touch it a lot.\u201d She let her middle finger draw circles around that hidden bit of flesh.</p><p>Brandt chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m sure you do. But I\u2019m not done playin\u2019 with you. I like to drag this out because I love havin\u2019 my hands on you.\u201d His already raspy voice dropped another octave. \u201cIn you. Take your middle finger down, over your clit, separating those pussy lips and slide it inside your pussy. Slide it deep. All the way to the webbing of your hand.\u201d</p><p>Jessie jammed her fingers into her channel, arching her neck and nearly dropping the phone.</p><p>\u201cMove that finger in and out,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cMore. Add another one. Fuck yourself for me, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your thumb on your clit. Find that slippery knot and start out slow, building as you\u2019re pumping your fingers in and out of that tight heat. Hold the phone down there so I can hear you fucking your hand.</p><p>So I can hear how wet you are. How wet I\u2019m makin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>She removed the phone from her ear and held it above her pelvis as she worked herself with her fingers. \u201cCan you hear that, Brandt? So wet. So hot. Only for you. I\u2019m so close. Send me over. Make me come. Please.\u201d Jessie heard him swear and she put the phone back by her ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I was there I\u2019d be kissin\u2019 your neck, leaving love bruises from that spot below your ear to your collarbone. I\u2019d feel those cunt muscles pulling my fingers in deeper with every stroke as I moved my thumb faster over your clit. Then I\u2019d whisper, \u2018My sweet, sexy Jessie, come for me now\u2019 and you\u2019d explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Brandt,\u201d was all she got out before the spasms hit. She gasped as her clit pulsed beneath her thumb. Her fingers were wedged deep in her pussy, squeezed by the contractions so strong they robbed her of breath. The orgasm didn\u2019t last long, but it was intense enough she dropped the phone.</p><p>When she heard, \u201cJessie?\u201d coming from far away, she turned, expecting to feel Brandt\u2019s warm body, because she always zoned out after she climaxed. She heard, \u201cJessie!\u201d again and opened her eyes. Brandt wasn\u2019t there. She was in a single bed with her hand between her legs and her cell phone on the mattress next to her head.</p> <p>\u201cHello? Jess? Did you hang up?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the phone and pushed herself up, reaching for the tissues on the nightstand. \u201cI\u2019m here.</p><p>But, did we really just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the most fuckin\u2019 amazing phone sex ever? Hell yeah we did, baby.\u201d</p><p>Jessie laughed softly. \u201cYou are so naughty, Brandt McKay. Making me come so hard that when I opened my eyes, it surprised me you weren\u2019t really here. But it sure felt like you were. The whole time. I especially like the way you whispered in my ear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou always like that,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNo matter which way we end up doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have given the Kama Sutra a run for its money, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what that is, but I do know when you started to make those hot, sexy noises, I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Got a hard-on?\u201d</p><p>His rough chuckle tickled her ear. \u201cNo. I had wood from the instant you told me you were wearin\u2019</p><p>them long john pajamas. So as I was tellin\u2019 you what I wanted you to do\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were taking the edge off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdge? Hell, when you started to come, I did too.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t get to have my turn blowing your mind, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already did. But next time I\u2019ll let you take the lead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely tomorrow night.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d She yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired. I\u2019ll let you get some sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for calling me, Brandt. Not just for the amazing phone sex, but for...\u201d Caring about me.</p><p>Jessie couldn\u2019t make herself say it. She could whimper, moan and play raunchy sex games with him, but when it came to disclosing her feelings...she just couldn\u2019t. Sex? She could handle. Getting Brandt\u2019s hopes up that this might become something more than sex seemed unfair.</p><p>\u201cAnytime sweetheart, I\u2019m not goin\u2019 anyplace. Sweet dreams.\u201d Brandt hung up.</p><p>Before Jessie fell asleep she realized she hadn\u2019t asked about Landon at all.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>\u201cOnly one thing puts a smile like that on a man\u2019s face,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cAnd it sure as hell ain\u2019t pumpkin pie,\u201d Dalton added with a snicker.</p><p>Brandt snapped out of his flashback to the second night of steamy phone sex with Jessie\u2014and glanced at his smartass brothers. \u201cMaybe the smile is because I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 about kickin\u2019 your asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. You\u2019da done it yesterday when Dad pissed you off. God knows you love to rail on us when he makes you so mad. Which don\u2019t seem fair, does it, Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I\u2019m used to bein\u2019 picked on.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s softly spoken, \u201cWe\u2019re all used to it,\u201d hung in the air of Brandt\u2019s truck cab like a slab of rotten meat.</p><p>Thanksgiving was supposed to be a day when family came together to eat, laugh, watch a little football, eat some more, play cards, hang out.</p><p>But that\u2019s never how Thanksgiving played out if Casper McKay had any say in it. He didn\u2019t give a shit that his wife had slaved over a hot stove creating a tasty, plentiful meal. He didn\u2019t care it was the first holiday he\u2019d spend with his only grandson. He didn\u2019t care none of his own family ever invited him over for holiday.</p><p>No, the only thing Brandt\u2019s father cared about was if there was enough beer in the fridge. Which there hadn\u2019t been. Which sent Casper McKay rummaging through liquor cabinet during dinner.</p><p>Belligerent didn\u2019t begin to describe his behavior after a couple of belts of whiskey. For the first time since Jessie had taken off for Riverton, Brandt was glad she hadn\u2019t been around to witness the family fiasco. His dad baiting him every five minutes. His dad bellering at Dalton for something he\u2019d done or left undone, probably a decade past. Then sneering at Tell for his pathetic attempts to keep the peace.</p><p>After three hours of pure hell, Brandt made his excuses. He and Landon hightailed it out of there.</p><p>How his sainted mother put up with Casper McKay\u2019s crap for over forty years was truly a miracle. But even docile Joan McKay had snapped at her husband when he acted like an ass. Which had been frequently.</p><p>\u201cDoes that smile mean you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 about Jessie?\u201d</p><p>Brandt gave Dalton, in the passenger seat, an annoyed look.</p><p>Tell leaned between them from the back of the quad cab. \u201cWhat Dalton ain\u2019t so good at askin\u2019\u2014\u201d he shoved Dalton slightly, \u201c\u2014is if you and Jessie are makin\u2019 plans for the future. Because you seem awful damn happy, and we\u2019d be pissed if you were keepin\u2019 it from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, because you guys have been so supportive when it comes to how I\u2019ve felt about Jess in the past,\u201d Brandt said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause now she feels the same way,\u201d Tell said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t before.\u201d</p><p>That jarred him. How did these two know how Jessie felt about him when he wasn\u2019t sure about it himself?</p><p>\u201cBesides. Jessie\u2019s changed. She was pretty firmly under Luke\u2019s thumb, and it\u2019s taken her some time to figure out who she is and find herself again.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shoved Tell this time. \u201cJesus, Tell, what\u2019s with you spouting off all this new age, hippie, mumbo-jumbo \u2018finding herself\u2019 bullshit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ve got a better explanation, Mr. D-minus in psychology?\u201d Tell shot back.</p><p>\u201cI sure do.\u201d</p><p>Brandt tuned them out as they bickered. He tuned them out so completely it took, \u201cWhoa, Brandt, you\u2019re gonna miss the turn,\u201d to get his focus back.</p><p>At least fifteen pickups were parked at Cord and AJ\u2019s house. Staring at Cord\u2019s big house, Brandt had that same wistful feeling he\u2019d felt at Ben\u2019s. Not wanting a fancy place to hang his hat, but a home, his own home. His trailer wasn\u2019t much more than a place to crash every night.</p><p>His brothers were quiet and Brandt wondered if they were thinking the same thing. Landon yelled,</p><p>\u201cUp!\u201d and drummed his feet into his carseat.</p><p>\u201cWe hear ya. I\u2019ll get him since I\u2019m already back here,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>After he got out of his truck, Brandt was surprised to see his mother walking toward him. Did that mean his dad had decided to show up at the annual McKay post-Thanksgiving get together? \u201cI didn\u2019t think you guys were comin\u2019 today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad isn\u2019t. I left him at home.\u201d His mother\u2019s eyes darted to where Dalton and Tell were unloading Landon. But she didn\u2019t go over to offer them help.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d She actually seemed nervous, which was crazy because she\u2019d been coming to McKay family events for four decades.</p><p>Her pale blue eyes shifted to him. Her dark hair, once streaked with silver, was now all silver. Again, it struck him how much she\u2019d aged since Luke\u2019s death. Her smiles were rare these days, too, so when she laughed, Brandt didn\u2019t know how to react.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I\u2019m nervous, even when I know that\u2019s just plain stupid. It\u2019s strange showing up at a McKay family party without your father, but ain\u2019t no one gonna be cryin\u2019 in their beer Casper ain\u2019t here.</p><p>Especially not his brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich puts you in an awkward position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not the first time nor will it be the last. Kimi and Carolyn and Vi have always treated me well, even when they can\u2019t stand Casper.\u201d She turned and looked at the house. \u201cHard to believe how long your father and I have been married. But when his brothers and their wives all started havin\u2019 babies...</p><p>I\u2019d come to these things and cry for days afterward because I wanted what they had.\u201d</p><p>He knew his mother wasn\u2019t only speaking about kids.</p><p>\u201cThen my boys came,\u201d she absentmindedly reached out and stroked Brandt\u2019s coat sleeve, \u201cand I fit in.</p><p>I could join in the discussions about toilet training, frogs in the bathtub, and the ranching responsibilities you\u2019d all have to live up to as you grew into men.</p><p>\u201cThen in recent years it\u2019s been about grandbabies and I\u2019ve had that feeling of envy all over again. Oh, I know you boys are younger than your McKay cousins and weren\u2019t nowhere near ready to settle down, but I\u2019d hoped Luke and Jessie might...but that never happened. And now we\u2019ve got Landon...\u201d</p><p>Feeling helpless, Brandt grabbed her hand because it was so unlike her to babble.</p><p>\u201cAfter Luke died, I didn\u2019t care about anything. Especially not about them and their perfect kids and darling little grandkids and how they didn\u2019t have to deal with the unending pain of losing a child. I became bitter. As bitter as your father. I shut down and your dad got meaner yet. I ain\u2019t gonna make excuses for him, but I will apologize for myself. I haven\u2019t been much of a mother to you boys since we lost Luke, and I should\u2019ve tried harder. I should\u2019ve pulled you boys closer, not pushed away from all of you when we needed each other more than ever\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom.

On Thanksgiving. To let you know how thankful I am for each of you, but...well. You were there. Wasn\u2019t exactly a Norman Rockwell painting, was it?\u201d</p><p>None of them could look at each other, which was just weird.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She used a lace hankie to wipe her nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to blather like a fool and get so weepy.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence passed as they all struggled.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mom. Tell cries all the damn time. It\u2019s sort of embarrassin\u2019 if you wanna know the truth,\u201d</p><p>Dalton mock-whispered.</p><p>Tell probably would\u2019ve shoved him, but Dalton was holding a wide-eyed Landon.</p><p>She smiled wanly, shaking her head with that \u201cboys will be boys\u201d look of resignation Brandt recognized. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been sitting in your car in the cold for an hour? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to go in there by myself.\u201d She sniffed and laughed at the same time. \u201cStupid, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot stupid. You were just waiting for us, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and wiped her cheeks.</p><p>Brandt was afraid she\u2019d start crying again, and he knew how much that\u2019d embarrass her in front of their McKay relatives. He looked at Dalton. \u201cHow about if you let Mom carry Landon inside?\u201d</p><p>If he thought his mother was done with tears, he was mistaken. Because for some reason, that made her cry harder.</p><p>A few hours later, the noise level in Cord and AJ\u2019s house still rivaled the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Kids and dogs running everywhere, inside and out. Men gathered in the den shouting at a football game on TV. Pregnant women in the kitchen. Nursing mothers and babies in the living room. Still more kids racing up and down the stairs. It was pure chaos.</p><p>Brandt loved every second of it. He wished Jessie were here because he knew she\u2019d love it too.</p> <p>\u201cKane?\u201d Ginger shouted from the living room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d Brandt said. He wandered to the den where his uncles were sacked out in the easy chairs, snoring, while his cousins were crouched on the floor, surrounded by kids, trying to watch the game.</p><p>\u201cKane? Ginger\u2019s lookin\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there.\u201d Immediately Kane pushed to his feet and brushed past Brandt as he lingered in the doorway.</p><p>A collective groan arose at a play on the football field.</p><p>Colby shifted his youngest son, Austin, asleep on his lap, and pointed at the TV. \u201cThat\u2019s gotta be a personal foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Colby,\u201d Cam said. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna get their butts handed to them today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no pussy ref call is gonna make a damn bit of difference,\u201d Ben said. \u201cShit, I mean shoot, I\u2019m not supposed to say the \u2018p\u2019 word in front of the kiddos, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cDitto for the \u2018d\u2019 word and the \u2018s\u2019 word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf poor Ben can\u2019t curse he ain\u2019t gonna have no language skills at all,\u201d Chase drawled from the other side of the room.</p><p>Ben whipped a pillow at him. \u201cFu\u2014I mean funny.\u201d</p><p>Chase caught the pillow, almost without looking.</p><p>Colt whistled. \u201cYou oughta be playin\u2019 ball instead of ridin\u2019 bulls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass. No buckle bunnies waitin\u2019 for a hard ride after a baseball game like they are after a bull riding expo.\u201d</p><p>Tell sighed. \u201cDude. You have the perfect life.\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked around. This room used to seem so big, but now it couldn\u2019t hold them all. Colt was backed against the wall with Hudson on his lap. Cam was kicked back in the recliner with his two youngest boys sprawled on him. Quinn\u2019s son Adam rested his head on Quinn\u2019s thigh. Kade leaned against the recliner, his lap empty. Didn\u2019t appear his girls were the slightest bit interested in football.</p><p>A dark haired boy Brandt recognized as Carter\u2019s middle son, Spencer, was curled up in the corner.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t see the kid\u2019s father. \u201cWhere\u2019s Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorkin\u2019 on some art thing. Said he\u2019d be by later.\u201d</p><p>Colt snorted. \u201cSo he says. But since he sent Macie over here with all the kids, what do you think the chances are that\u2019ll happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlim to none,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t seen Keely\u2019s husband, Jack, either. \u201cWhere\u2019s Keely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and Jack went to his mom\u2019s in South Dakota for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she wants to be here on Christmas to see the looks on our faces after she gives each of her nephews a drum set,\u201d Cord said. When his youngest son, Foster, snuggled into his chest, Cord gently patted his back and lowered his voice. \u201cIf she ain\u2019t bluffin\u2019 I swear I will strangle her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, get in line. She informed me the nieces are getting tambourines,\u201d Cam pointed out. \u201cThat ain\u2019t any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely just told you guys this?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cYep, she doesn\u2019t want anyone to \u2018steal\u2019 her present ideas, since she\u2019s dragged Jack along as her pack mule for Black Friday sales shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor bastard,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cThat \u2018b\u2019 word is off limits too,\u201d Quinn reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI just got a text from Jack that said, Kill me now,\u201d Carter said.</p><p>Everyone turned toward Carter, who stood behind Brandt.</p><p>\u201cHey, you are here,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>\u201cI said I would be.\u201d Carter\u2019s gaze moved between Colt and Colby. \u201cThanks for the vote of confidence, guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you gotta admit you lose track of time when you\u2019re workin\u2019 on a new sculpture,\u201d Cam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? Pick on Carter day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, gotta uphold the tradition of pickin\u2019 on the youngest since Keely ain\u2019t here,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cTerrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab a seat.\u201d</p><p>Carter looked around. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>Chase stood. \u201cYou can have my spot. I need air.\u201d As Chase passed by Brandt, he made the \u201cwanna beer?\u201d sign and Brandt nodded, grabbing his coat before he followed Chase out the front door.</p><p>The lid on the cooler slammed and Chase handed him a Bud Light. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo prob.\u201d</p><p>Their breath came out in a misty white steam. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s cold out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s quiet.\u201d Chase took a long swallow. \u201cI\u2019m not used to bein\u2019 around so many kids. I ain\u2019t gonna lie. It drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry. I forgot that you\u2019re takin\u2019 care of Luke\u2019s kid for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. But there\u2019s a huge difference between one kid and twenty-some kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how is it goin\u2019 with Landon?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOkay. Jessie\u2019s been workin\u2019 with him to get him to talk more. He\u2019s adjusted to bein\u2019</p><p>around kids in the daycare, but the first couple of days were sheer hell for both of us.\u201d</p><p>When Chase kept quiet, Brandt said, \u201cYou wondering how come I was such a bastard and brought Jessie into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lyin\u2019 if I didn\u2019t admit it crossed my mind.\u201d Chase looked straight ahead and drank. \u201cSo you\u2019re livin\u2019 with Jessie? At her place?\u201d</p><p>Brandt leaned across the railing. \u201cFor now. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious. Seems everyone is pairing up and producing the next generation of McKays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already paired up with one McKay and that didn\u2019t work out so good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably because she was paired with the wrong McKay to start with.\u201d</p><p>Not touching that one.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? I read all about the \u2018Wyoming Wild Man\u2019 in the rodeo magazines. Sounds like you\u2019ve got a girl in every town and left a string of broken hearts across the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how the media exaggerates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo none of it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><p>Chase grinned. \u201cOh, it\u2019s completely true. The raunchier stuff don\u2019t make the trade mags.\u201d He peeped over his shoulder, then back at Brandt. \u201cI gotta admit, I love havin\u2019 a different girl or two every night if I want. They wanna fuck a top fifteen bull rider and I let \u2019em. Win-win, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Who\u2019s the flavor this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlavors\u2014plural, as in Miss Rodeo Nevada and Miss Rodeo Montana. Damn good thing the states aren\u2019t next to each other, huh?\u201d</p><p>Brandt whistled. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had a thing for them fancy types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not to love about big hair, tight jeans, high heeled boots, lots of cleavage and rhinestones?</p><p>Dude. I\u2019m so there. Not to mention them queens can ride you hard and squeeze you dry. Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 I like better than ridin\u2019 double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch yourself, Chase. You\u2019re gonna run across one of them beauty queens whose daddy don\u2019t like his little girl bein\u2019 toyed with and he\u2019s gonna get out the shotgun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle myself. And lookit you, B, goin\u2019 all big brother on me, worried about me getting my ass full of buckshot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole. I\u2019m worried about you bustin\u2019 your ass and getting crippled up because you\u2019re too stupid to understand you ain\u2019t invincible and you ain\u2019t gonna be able to ride forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrue. But I\u2019ll climb on a back of a bull as long as I can.\u201d He took another drink of beer. \u201cAnd the injury is healin\u2019 fine, if my nosy-assed brothers asked you to grill me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Chase shivered. \u201cI forget how goddamn cold it is here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiled competing in all those warm climes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fact, which is probably why I\u2019ll end up livin\u2019 someplace down south. Speakin\u2019 of... Did your dad talk to you guys about them starting to legally restructure the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Should he\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to my dad, Uncle Carson and Uncle Cal, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this have to do with Keely getting a chunk of McKay land as a wedding gift?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPartially. But a couple of us are opting out of bein\u2019 part of the McKay land trust permanently.\u201d</p><p>Brandt froze. \u201cWhat the hell are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>Chase kicked back and rested his shoulders on the porch support post. \u201cYou really had no clue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. So who\u2019s opting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, for one.\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked at him curiously. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve got my own life outside of the ranch. Even if I quit ridin\u2019 next year, chances are slim I\u2019d move back here and be part of the McKay cattle business. Quinn and Ben always were more involved than me, they wanted this life more than I ever did, so it makes sense that my portion goes to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinn and Ben agreed?\u201d</p><p>Chase shrugged. \u201cOh, they tried to protest, but in truth, it was a relief. I have other income. They don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else is opting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam. Like Keely, he\u2019s trading his stake for a chunk of land, in his case, for the fifty acres around his house, which borders the neighbor\u2019s acreage, so it\u2019ll be an easy deed transfer. Carter is still debating, but I think he\u2019ll opt out too. With his art career takin\u2019 off, not to mention he\u2019s helpin\u2019 Cash Big Crow with his ranching operation in River Bend, he\u2019s spreading himself thin driving back and forth when he doesn\u2019t have to. There are plenty of McKays to keep the cattle business goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Brandt fought the surge of anger. This was the type of ranch business his father should\u2019ve been telling him.</p><p>Would he have told Luke?</p><p>Yes, goddammit.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kick my old man\u2019s sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme know ahead of time. I\u2019ll sell tickets.\u201d</p><p>One thing Brandt admired about Chase; he just said what was on his mind, straight up.</p><p>Chase\u2019s cell phone rang. He dug it out of his front pocket and scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s my publicist. Excuse me.\u201d He snapped, \u201cSugar tits, you\u2019d better have a goddamn good reason for calling me on Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Chase called his publicist... sugar tits? That didn\u2019t sound very professional.</p><p>Brandt finished his beer and returned inside. He tried to sneak past the living room where the mamas and babies were holding court, but he heard, \u201cBrandt! Come here.\u201d</p><p>Two million pairs of eyes bored into him. Okay, it was only India, Skylar, Libby, Ginger and Macie, but it seemed like more. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said to India, who\u2019d tucked her new baby boy Ellison so closely to her breast he only saw a blanket covered lump.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be worried?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cActually, we were talking about Jessie,\u201d Ginger said, shifting the baby in her lap.</p><p>Great. So now he and Jessie were permanently linked in his family\u2019s eyes? He was good with that, but he doubted Jessie would be. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her since she left for Riverton?\u201d</p><p>If \u201ctalked\u201d is a euphemism for having scorching hot phone sex with her two nights running, then yes.</p><p>\u201cHello? Earth to Brandt.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve talked to her. She\u2019s havin\u2019 a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. She deserved a break.\u201d</p><p>Was it his imagination, or did the room turn a little hostile? Were they blaming him for Jessie needing a break?</p><p>Of course they are, dumbass.</p><p>\u201cJessie is great with all the kids at Sky Blue.\u201d Skylar tucked the pink blanket around Ginger and Kane\u2019s baby girl Maddie, nestled in her arms. \u201cWe\u2019d be lost without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument from me.\u201d Dammit. That wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d meant.</p><p>Or was it?</p><p>Again, those two million eyes pinned him in place.</p><p>Quick. Change the subject and get out before they pounce. \u201cLook, have you seen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom and Landon?\u201d Macie supplied. \u201cYes, she\u2019s changing him. Said she\u2019ll be right back so you might as well stick around and chat with us.\u201d</p><p>Chat. Right. They planned to hold his boots to the fire.</p><p>The baby pressed to Macie\u2019s shoulder let out a huge burp. Macie rubbed her back. \u201cGood girl, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s Jessie been doing while she\u2019s staying at her mom\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. We haven\u2019t talked about it.\u201d</p><p>Skylar and India exchanged a look.</p><p>A look Brandt didn\u2019t like at all. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, probably,\u201d Skylar said.</p><p>\u201cSky,\u201d India said gently, \u201cit won\u2019t hurt to ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jessie mentioned anything to you about looking for a job while she was in Riverton?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Brandt said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? I told you, sis. You\u2019re worried for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she look for a job there?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cShe misses her mom, among other things.\u201d</p><p>Sky gave India a sharp look, which indicated there was something else going on, but India clammed up.</p><p>Brandt half listened as the women chatted about daycare, but his brain had gotten stuck on one thing: the possibility of Jessie leaving.</p><p>The logical portion of his brain pointed out that she loved her job. The nasty part of his brain pointed out that if Landon became a fixture in the McKay family, she\u2019d put distance between them in a helluva hurry. And to be honest, how could he blame her?</p><p>His gut twisted. He considered the women in this room, all happily married to his cousins, wondering if they had any advice on how to keep Jessie here, in his life, forever.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t paying attention to him.</p><p>When Amelia fussed, Libby lifted her shirt.</p><p>When Paulson fussed, Ginger lifted her shirt.</p><p>When Ellison fussed, India lifted her shirt.</p><p>Skylar laughed when Maddie started bumping her head into her chest. \u201cHuh-uh, girlie, I\u2019ve got nothing in there for you. Let\u2019s get you back to mama.\u201d</p><p>Ginger sighed and lifted up the other side of her shirt.</p><p>Dear God. Were all these women just whipping out their breasts like it was no big deal?</p><p>Don\u2019t look. Your cousins will beat your ass for gawking at their wives\u2019 bared breasts.</p><p>This was so freakin\u2019 weird. Yeah, he knew that breastfeeding was natural and all that jazz, but he had brothers for Christsake, not sisters, and he\u2019d never actually seen a live pair of breasts until he was sixteen.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen woman nurse a baby. Ever. And it sure as hell didn\u2019t look as clinical and messy as a cow standing around chewing her cud while a calf noisily sucked on her teats.</p><p>\u201cBrandt? You okay?\u201d India asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, I gotta go.\u201d He raced out so fast he nearly tripped over his own feet.</p><p>Feminine laughter chased him out of the room.</p><p>Brandt slipped into the den and heaved a sigh of relief. All men in here, burping, farting, scratching themselves, arguing, being guys. Guys, he understood. Women, not so much.</p><p>And maybe that was his biggest problem.</p><p>Before he left Cord and AJ\u2019s, Skylar took him aside. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Brandt. This is a confusing time for you and Jessie both. But you need to remember one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give her a reason to stay here, she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do I do that, Skylar?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked to Landon, sleeping on his shoulder, and then back to him. \u201cBy not giving her an excuse to leave.\u201d</p><p>Well, that cleared things up a whole helluva lot.</p><p>Not.</p><p>He smiled tightly. \u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d</p><p>Later that night he lay in bed and waited for Jessie to call. But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Nor did she call the next night.</p><p>Would he seem too fucking needy if he called her?</p><p>Or would it seem like he didn\u2019t give a shit if he didn\u2019t call?</p><p>Man, he sucked at this relationship stuff.</p><p>Finally he called and left a message on her voice mail.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t call him back.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Good. He was home.</p><p>Jessie left Lexie outside to run off her extra energy after being cooped up inside the truck for the last five hours. She tried to be quiet as she snuck up the steps, wanting to maintain the surprise.</p><p>It worked. After she opened the door and slipped inside Brandt\u2019s trailer, she glanced at the man who sat on the couch, remote in hand, completely goggle-eyed.</p><p>Then his sly, sexy smile appeared. \u201cDamn girl. It\u2019s great to see you, but you had me worried since I haven\u2019t heard from you the last two days.\u201d</p><p>Jessie kicked off her boots. Unwrapped the scarf. Peeled off her gloves and unbuttoned her long wool coat. \u201cSorry about that. I lost my cell phone Friday afternoon in the Tetons when we were snowshoeing. By the time I realized it and activated a new phone, and charged it up, it was time to head home. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d He set the remote on the coffee table, next to a full bottle of Corona. \u201cDid you have a good time at your mom\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Brandt? Making idle chitchat? Which would be sweet if his hungry eyes weren\u2019t already stripping her bare. Not a sweet thing about those midnight blue eyes right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She skirted the coffee table. \u201cIs Landon sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.

She tried to keep it easy, a deep, slow, wet reunion kiss. But the sensation of his full warm lips beneath hers, the glide of his tongue against hers, his taste and his scent made her wild, and she inhaled him in a blazing kiss of pure need.</p><p>Heady stuff, how he met her kiss for kiss, touch for touch, breath for breath.</p><p>She moved her lips along the line of his jaw to his ear. \u201cGod, Brandt. I\u2019m dying for you. Phone sex was hot, but I want real sex. Lots of it. Right now.\u201d She slid off his lap.</p><p>Keeping her eyes on his, she circled her fingers around his wrists, tugging him to his feet. While gorging herself on his addictive kisses, she herded him down the hallway to his bedroom. After locking the bedroom door, Jessie jerked Brandt\u2019s shirt off. She made short work of his jeans, yanking the denim and his boxers to the floor.</p><p>Then she pushed him on the bed.</p><p>Brandt propped himself on his elbows, not the least bit bothered by his nakedness. Or his full-blown hard-on. And he shouldn\u2019t be. His rockin\u2019 body should always be naked.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you grinning at, Miss Jessie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thought of you being naked twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be much fun if I was nekkid alone. Speaking of nekkid...\u201d His predatory gaze moved over her in a sensual caress. \u201cYou have way too many clothes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? I might be inclined to take them all off, but there is one little condition.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cName it,\u201d without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI get to have my wicked way with you and you just have to lay there and take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>There was that smile of his, the smile that promised he\u2019d keep his word, but also guaranteed delicious payback.</p><p>Jessie disrobed and crawled over him, loving how his body heat warmed her skin. She tucked her knees by his hips and bent down, letting her hair fall in a curtain around their faces. She savored the give and take of mouths, as they both took a turn at leading the kiss.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s arms were casually thrown above his head, but before too long, those rough-skinned hands were sliding up her arms, gliding down her back, stopping to cup her butt cheeks. He whispered, \u201cJess.</p><p>Before we... I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo put my mouth on you. I know you\u2019re wet. I can smell that hot sweetness between your thighs.</p><p>The need to taste you is makin\u2019 me crazy.\u201d He nuzzled her temple. \u201cYou can do anything you want to me after, but first, I wanna feel you come against my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Ah. What was she supposed to say? No way? When her clit was doing the wave in anticipation of Brandt\u2019s mouth? \u201cYou drive a hard bargain, but...okay.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Jessie pushed back to balance on her knees as she straddled Brandt\u2019s thighs.</p><p>\u201cSexy girl. Stay just like that. Don\u2019t move.\u201d He wiggled his body down until his head was between her knees. \u201cGoddammit my mouth is watering and I can\u2019t reach you. Fall forward on your elbows and hands. That\u2019s it.\u201d His palms pushed on the inside of her thighs, sliding her legs out farther and then his fingers gripped her ass.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see what he was doing, but a second after she felt the first wet swipe of his tongue, she nearly went blind with pleasure anyway.</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t tease. He lapped at her slit. Licked and mapped every inch of her folds with absolute gusto. Buried his tongue in her channel and fucked her with it.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t gonna take long,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cThen I can do this again later.\u201d He did a twirly, swirly maneuver from her clit to her anus. Using his lips and his tongue in such raunchy ways.</p><p>\u201cBrandt.\u201d So close. She rolled her hips back, wanting that continual attention to her pleasure point.</p><p>He growled and brought her down, so she straddled his face. She had no idea how he was breathing, but when he fastened his mouth to her top of her sex and did a sexy rhythmic, slurping thing directly on her clit, she didn\u2019t care. \u201cYes. Please. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Her hands grabbed fistfuls of the quilt as Brandt kept pushing her higher. Each lick. Each suck. Each incredible flicker of his tongue and she was sure her body would simply ignite.</p><p>And it did. Jessie pressed her face into the mattress and bit back a scream as her clit pulsed against Brandt\u2019s hot mouth. Despite the blood pounding in her groin, her ears and her throat, she still heard the sexy sounds of him swallowing. Drinking her down.</p><p>That set her off again.</p><p>When she floated back from that head rushing, body buzzing happy place, she pushed herself back up on her knees. She smoothed back her tangled hair and scooted down Brandt\u2019s upper torso so she could see his face.</p><p>His look of cockiness was totally justified. He licked his lips and said, \u201cMmm. Tasty.\u201d</p><p>Jessie fastened her mouth to his, surprising him with an openmouthed kiss, sucking her taste from his tongue, rubbing her face through the sticky glaze on his cheeks, nipping and biting and enjoying his shock.</p><p>She said, \u201cMove up and spread out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguments, buster. You agreed. Me. In charge.\u201d</p><p>Brandt sighed, but it wasn\u2019t a sigh of frustration.</p><p>She pinned his arms above his head and allowed her hands to track the muscles from his wrists down the sinew defining in his forearms, over the bulge of his biceps to the cup of his shoulders. \u201cI never get to touch you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime you want, all you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re usually so busy touching me. It makes me lose my mind and I sort of get lost.\u201d She snared her gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew how long I\u2019d dreamed of getting my hands all over you, Jess, you\u2019d know how untrue that statement really is.\u201d</p><p>Her belly fluttered. She ducked her head from the intensity in his eyes and let her palms drift over his pectorals. God. There was just something so wholly masculine about a guy with chest hair. This part of his body always smelled good. Not musky like his groin, but earthy. Soap and sweat. She rubbed her lips down the delineated line between his pecs, loving how the crisp hair tickled her chin and cheek. She rubbed her face all over his chest, practically purring.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s hand landed on the side of her head and he brushed the hair from her cheek.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cDid I say you could touch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I like watchin\u2019 you touchin\u2019 me. It\u2019s sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. So you wanna watch me do this?\u201d Jessie used the tip of her tongue to trace the outline of his right nipple.</p><p>His arms broke out in goose flesh. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you like that.\u201d Jessie closed her eyes and sucked the flat disk until the center drew up into a rigid point. She let her tongue flick back and forth before she sucked hard again. Then she used her teeth.</p><p>She felt his cock jumping between their bodies and she curled her hand around the shaft, pumping it while she tongued his nipple.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Oh fuck.\u201d</p><p>Reducing Brandt\u2019s vocabulary to curse words was a good sign. Her lips skimmed his skin as she blindly sought the nipple on the other side. Her mouth enclosed the tiny nub and she got those same hot, sexy noises when she worked it relentlessly.</p><p>His hips pumped up, which meant he was ready for the next phase of seduction. She slowly kissed her way down the trail of dark hair running along the center of his belly.</p><p>\u201cJess. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking yet. I want you in my mouth for a little while first.\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>She smiled. She let her breath tease the purple crown of his cock before she swallowed him to where her right gripped the thick base. She didn\u2019t move, concentrating on the heat and the hardness and the taste of this intimate part of him.</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t buck his pelvis, or grab her head, or ask for her to finish him. He allowed her to do what she wanted, despite the rapid beat of his pulse in the vein running up the length of his dick, a vein that pulsed so sweetly against her tongue.</p><p>Jessie took her time, using all the tricks she\u2019d learned about him that made him moan or twitch or curse. She stopped teasing him and lifted her head. \u201cI\u2019m giving you two choices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck you off. Or...\u201d</p><p>Just a tad impatiently he demanded, \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do something new.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your dirty girl fantasy, Brandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted to do to a woman but you\u2019ve never tried?\u201d</p><p>His gaze skittered away and then back. \u201cWhy are you askin\u2019 me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanna fulfill that dirty girl fantasy, Brandt. I wanna do the one thing for you that you\u2019ve never had the guts to ask any other woman.\u201d She suckled the head of his cock while keeping her gaze firmly on his. \u201cTell me. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d When Brandt squirmed, she knew this was stepping far outside his comfort zone.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>He reached down and traced her jawline, from the front of her temple down to the tip of her chin.</p><p>Then he swept the rough pad of his thumb across her bottom lip. \u201cI wanna come on your face. I wanna see my come coating your lips before you lick it off and swallow it all.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap that was a hot request. Really hot. Especially coming from a cowboy gentleman such as Brandt McKay. She smiled and licked another pearl of pre-come from the slit in his dick.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that? You\u2019d say yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. So where do you want me? On my knees between your legs, sitting on the floor? You\u2019d probably have better aim if I was on the floor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandt looked stricken for half a second, then he laughed softly. \u201cGod. You\u2019re killin\u2019 me, woman.</p><p>Yes. On your knees on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Jessie slithered down his body purposely letting her hair drift across his groin, his thighs and the tops of his feet, because she knew how ticklish he was.</p> <p>\u201cPlayin\u2019 with fire, Jessie.\u201d Brandt sat up and pressed the creases of his knees into the edge of the bed.</p><p>Setting her hands on his thighs, she bowed her head over him, taking his cock into her mouth completely. Keeping her lips suctioned tight didn\u2019t keep the saliva in her mouth. She used the wetness to move faster, letting it trickle out of her mouth and coat his shaft.</p><p>\u201cFuck, I love it when your mouth gets me so wet I can feel it dripping down my balls.\u201d</p><p>The husky way he dirty talked made the inside of her thighs sticky. Jessie slid her hand down to fondle his sac. So tight. So ready.</p><p>Then the skin on his shaft seemed to tighten even more.</p> <p>Brandt eased out of her mouth and she looked at him.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He fisted his cock in his hand and was beating off with more force that she\u2019d dare try. He rasped, \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>As if she could tear her gaze away from the eroticism of him masturbating.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on my thighs. Lean closer but arch your back. Yeah, like that. You\u2019re so goddamn hot, Jess, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re...\u201d He groaned. \u201cClose your eyes and part your lips.\u201d</p><p>The slapping sounds increased as did his moans and the first spurt landed on her cheek. The next on her chin. The next on her chest. Followed by warm drops hitting her upper lip. Several droplets slid down the center of her lip and dripped into her mouth. The salty tang made her want to swallow the full taste of him, but she stayed still.</p><p>The flesh slapping noises stopped and Brandt\u2019s strenuous breathing filled the room. She could feel his eyes, drinking her in, as she kneeled before him, her body bearing the marks of his passion.</p> <p>She felt his pleasure even when he didn\u2019t utter a word.</p><p>Softly, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>The droplets had cooled. Brandt swept his thumb over the stickiness on her lips and said, \u201cLick it.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>Brandt swiped a wet spot on her jaw and pressed his thumb into her mouth. \u201cSuck it.\u201d</p><p>How different his come tasted on his hand instead of directly from the source.</p><p>He continued to wipe every drop of come from her chest, her neck, her face. She sucked and licked his fingers. His slow, deliberate means of drawing out the connection set her skin to tingling. Her focus dimmed to just fulfilling Brandt\u2019s needs. There was incredible power in surrendering to this man because she knew he wouldn\u2019t abuse it.</p><p>His lips grazed her ear, sending a shudder from her neck to her toes. \u201cSexy, nasty Jessie. Are you my dirty girl now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. God yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I reach between your thighs will I find you wet?\u201d</p><p>She could come just from him whispering in her ear. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what should I do about that wetness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you want. Just touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Jessie opened her eyes.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s cheeks were rosy. His eyes were brimming with lust and his cock was fully erect again. He took her hands in his with a forceful, \u201cC\u2019mere,\u201d and he moved them into the center of the bed. Then he flipped them so Jessie was on her back. He eased into her bit by bit, watching her eyes with the possessive gleam that caused her stomach to somersault. The instant he began to stroke inside her, she brought her legs up and circled his waist.</p><p>This was what she wanted. Needed. Him. This closeness. This tight fit. This perfect friction. This bond she only got from being with him.</p><p>He joined their hands and slid them above their heads, bringing their bodies in full contact from chest to legs.</p><p>\u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Brandt kissed her.</p><p>When he kissed her, everything fell into place. She brushed her lips over the spot below his ear that made him shudder. \u201cI missed you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cI missed you too, Jess. A lot.\u201d</p><p>And rather than taking an afternoon to prove how much he missed her, Brandt took the entire week.</p><p>Not every instance was sexual. He made her coffee. He shoveled out her truck after it snowed. He got up early and fed the animals so they could have a long shower together before starting their workday. All thoughtful things that showed Brandt really listened to her. He cared that she was happy. That was the sweetest feeling of all because she\u2019d never had that before.</p><p>He made love to her every night before they went to sleep. Sometimes hard and urgent. Sometimes slowly and tenderly. Every night after he\u2019d rocked her body and her world, he\u2019d spooned behind her in her bed and held her all night long.</p><p>With every touch, every laugh, every new inside joke, Jessie knew this was moving out of the realm of a temporary situation, into something permanent.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Jessie had forgotten how much she loved the holidays.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t because Landon brought out her childish glee. The kid was still too young to understand what the hustle and bustle was about. But he loved the sparkly lights, the excitement in the air. The cookies.</p><p>Her little man was as much a cookie monster as her big man.</p><p>Her happiness stemmed from having someone like Brandt to share simple things with. They\u2019d done no Christmas shopping. They hadn\u2019t decorated much. They hadn\u2019t attended a single holiday party.</p><p>The Sunday trip into the woods with Landon to chop down the perfect pine tree hadn\u2019t started on a fun note. Lexie had taken off after a deer and knocked Landon over with enough force he\u2019d rolled down a small hill and landed face first in a snowbank. With snow inside his jacket, snow down his pants and snow in his boots, he\u2019d screamed bloody murder. Then Brandt fell into a shallow stream hidden beneath icy layers of snow, soaking both his boots and his pants up to his knees. When they\u2019d gotten back to the truck, wet and miserable, Jessie realized she\u2019d forgotten Landon\u2019s bottle, but she\u2019d remembered the thermos of coffee. Too bad she hadn\u2019t remembered to screw the lid on tight because the coffee had spilled, creating a puddle on the passenger side floorboard of Brandt\u2019s truck.</p><p>But after they\u2019d returned to Jessie\u2019s place, cleaned up and warmed up, the three of them snuggled on the couch to watch cartoon Christmas classics. They\u2019d gorged themselves on sugar cookies, loaded with colored sprinkles, and warm, chocolatey milk. Then after Brandt tucked a sticky, sugary, exhausted Landon in bed, they\u2019d curled up together on the couch, talking, laughing, making out like teenagers. Indulging in long, candy-flavored kisses, cold hands straying beneath wool sweaters, rubbing noses, creating static electricity from rubbing their fully clothed bodies together, drifting off in front of the soft glow of the Christmas tree lights.</p><p>It\u2019d truly been one of the best days Jessie remembered.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Brandt. \u201cSorry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need peanut butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Jelly too. Here\u2019s the list. I\u2019m going to grab some tater tots.\u201d</p><p>As they passed the junk food aisle, Landon said, \u201cCookie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, lil\u2019 buckaroo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYef!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You\u2019ve eaten your weight in cookies this week. We\u2019re all boarding the veggie train. Carrots.</p><p>Broccoli. Snow peas. Yum.\u201d</p><p>She slowed in the frozen food section after passing two hundred kinds of frozen pizza. She\u2019d just tossed a bag of tater tots and a bag of chicken nuggets into the cart when she heard, \u201cIs that Landon?\u201d</p><p>Jessie looked at the woman blocking her cart. Around forty, she had dyed red hair with two inches of brown root showing. She reeked of cigarettes. Her pale face was pinched as if she\u2019d been sucking on a sour pickle.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>The woman leaned to squint at Landon. \u201cThat is him.\u201d She focused on Jessie. \u201cIs the boy\u2019s name still Landon or did you change it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha did the right thing and finally gave that kid up for adoption. That girl had no business being a mother. When my son told me some of the shit she pulled...well, it\u2019s a wonder she stayed out of jail as long as she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d fell out of Jessie\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Drexel\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>Who was Drexel? And who in their right mind would name their kid Drexel?</p><p>\u201cSamantha moved in with Drex after her aunt kicked her out. She took off about six months later. I wasn\u2019t surprised. Drex had gotten tired of her bullshit and lies anyway.\u201d She jerked her chin toward Landon. \u201cHe\u2019s a cute kid. Lucky to have the chance to overcome his bad start in life.\u201d</p><p>Jessie frowned.</p><p>\u201cI hope you had him tested for mental problems. If not, you should because Drex was pretty sure Samantha drank like a fish and smoked pot when she was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that\u2019s any business of yours.\u201d</p><p>Those bloodshot eyes drew together. \u201cWell excuse the fuck outta me for tryin\u2019 to help you. I doubt you knew what you were getting into when you agreed to adopt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>The woman turned. Then her calculating gaze winged between Brandt and Jessie. \u201cYou\u2019re the adoptive father? I was just telling your wife about some of the issues you might have with the kid.\u201d</p><p>Brandt bit off, \u201cNot that it\u2019s any of your business, but we\u2019re Landon\u2019s guardians, not his adoptive parents.\u201d</p><p>The clicking noise of the woman\u2019s acrylic fingernails against the glass doors sounded like one of those killer insects about to sting. \u201cSo she really did it, huh? Dumped the kid off with his father\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>Landon\u2019s mother had told this freak she intended to contact the McKays?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are, lady, but you don\u2019t know squat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know more than you do. When Samantha lived with Drex, she talked about turning the boy over to his father\u2019s family so she could be free. Most the time she was so wasted she didn\u2019t remember she even had a kid, let alone knowing how to take care of him. Get used to him being around permanently, because she won\u2019t want him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Brandt didn\u2019t look away from the woman when he spoke to Jessie. \u201cJess. Go.\u201d</p><p>A million thoughts spun in her head as she reached the checkout line. Obviously the woman knew Landon. But not as well as she knew Landon\u2019s mother. How much of what she\u2019d said was true? Had Samantha just been biding her time? Brandt hadn\u2019t said anything about his jail visit with Samantha, but Jessie knew the visit had upset him. Had Samantha already told Brandt she didn\u2019t intend to take Landon back?</p> <p>It\u2019d been easy to forget these fears when everything had been going along so smoothly. She cared about Landon, but she had no desire to be the kid\u2019s mother. Because she never really would be his mother.</p><p>No matter what she did for him, he\u2019d always be affected by his mother abandoning him. He\u2019d always have that kernel of hope that someday his biological mother would come to her senses and connect with him.</p><p>Jessie could spend her life loving him and it wouldn\u2019t be enough. And it had nothing to do with him being a McKay.</p><p>\u201cMiss? You have to unload the cart yourself,\u201d the checker said to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Brandt said from behind her. When he set his hands on her shoulders, she shrugged him off.</p> <p>Brandt was smart enough to not push the issue as they drove back to her house. He readied Landon for bed and for once Landon didn\u2019t insist Jessie read him a bedtime story.</p><p>Jessie was grateful for the busy work of putting away groceries. Once she had that done, she decided she\u2019d scour the kitchen and the bathroom. If that didn\u2019t allow her brain to shut off, she\u2019d go into the barn and find some project to keep her energy and thoughts focused elsewhere.</p><p>Brandt came into the kitchen. \u201cWe need to talk about what happened at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d She squirted the cleaning solution on the countertop and scrubbed furiously, her rubber gloves squeaking with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun around and aimed the spray bottle at him. \u201cDon\u2019t push me. Leave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>Brandt snatched the plastic bottle out of her hand. \u201cNo. Now give me the goddamn gloves and sit on the couch so we can talk about this like rational adults because we\u2019re not gonna shove this under the rug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to order me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He exhaled slowly. \u201cJessie, will you sit on the couch with me so we can hash this out?\u201d</p><p>Say no.</p><p>Scream no.</p><p>He said, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Looking at him, she stripped off her gloves. \u201cGive me back my spray bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re done talkin\u2019. Do you want a beer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo shots comin\u2019 up.\u201d</p><p>Jessie chose to sit in the easy chair, which didn\u2019t make Brandt happy. But she needed to keep a clear head, and whenever Brandt touched her, she pretty much went mindless.</p><p>He set the bottle of Maker\u2019s Mark whiskey and two shot glasses on the coffee table. He poured. He knocked one back and refilled it again, holding the shot out to her.</p><p>She gulped it, welcoming the burn.</p><p>\u201cI know you said you didn\u2019t want to hear anything about Samantha, but in light of what happened, there are a few things you need to know. First off, that woman we saw tonight? According to Samantha, she\u2019s psycho. She\u2019s the mother of the guy Samantha lived with for a while. This woman used to show up, all hours of the night and day, looking for drugs, booze or money. She gave Samantha parenting advice, usually along the lines of give the kid up for adoption, your life will be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman said that stuff about adoption in front of her grown son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. She badgered Samantha about Landon\u2019s father, if he was paying child support. Between that and the issues with the boyfriend, it got bad enough Samantha left. And no matter what that psycho bitch claimed, Samantha didn\u2019t drink or do drugs during her pregnancy. I believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Samantha could be feeding you full of shit, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I talked to her aunt and she said Samantha was really sick the entire pregnancy. And Samantha was embarrassed. She barely left the house. As far as what happened after she gave birth to Landon, who knows? She racked up two DUIs. As far as her dumping him off with us for the long haul?</p><p>Nothin\u2019s been decided because she\u2019s still incarcerated.\u201d</p><p>Jessie poured another shot. \u201cThere is no \u2018us\u2019 in that context. You do understand that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, no. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Samantha right now?\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked at her skeptically for dodging the question. \u201cIn the halfway house. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been out of jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in that week has she asked to see her son at all?\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw flexed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo after being locked up and away from him for months, she\u2019s not chomping at the bit to see how he\u2019s doing? Especially since she left him in the care of virtual strangers?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the whiskey in his shot glass.</p><p>\u201cAnd since it\u2019s a halfway house, she could have him overnight at some point. Couldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she asked you if she can have him over Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m sure she has a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cValid excuse?\u201d Jessie supplied. \u201cWhat? She\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t have time to buy him a Santa gift?</p><p>No. The reason she hasn\u2019t asked for him is because she doesn\u2019t want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. The halfway house is just that, a place halfway between jail and normalcy. She\u2019s adjusting. She\u2019s got two more months before we should even be talkin\u2019 about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Jessie lifted her glass in a mock toast but didn\u2019t drink. \u201cI will uphold my end of sticking out the full four months. But it will end at four months, Brandt. I have not changed my mind. I like Landon, but he\u2019s not my child. If this whole thing heads south, like I suspect it will, if you want to file for permanent guardianship, fine. You can do that on your own. You don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this so different from if Luke had a kid from a previous relationship and that kid lived with you?\u201d Brandt demanded. \u201cWould you\u2019ve kicked him to the curb after Luke died?\u201d</p><p>She shook her finger at him. \u201cNot the same thing. If I knew that kid, if I\u2019d been raising him, I\u2019d continue raising him because chances would be good that kid would have no other alternative and he\u2019d probably consider me his mother. But Landon already has a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are impossible to reason with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m right and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re supposing, what if it comes down to Landon needing a permanent home and I become his legal guardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy for Landon because you\u2019d be good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You wouldn\u2019t be a part of either of our lives?\u201d</p><p>A sharp pain stabbed at her, thinking about walking away from Brandt forever. But unless she wanted to live her life waiting for the other boot to drop, she\u2019d have no choice. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The bitterness and pain in Brandt\u2019s eyes was like another hot poker to her heart.</p><p>\u201cLook. I care about him. But he\u2019s not mine, Brandt. He never will be. Even if I pour all my love, my heart and my soul into raising that boy, I\u2019ll never be his real mother. And if Samantha signed off on him as a toddler and had a change of heart or changed her life, ten or so years later? What then? Landon would need to give his mother a chance to be part of his life. I would have to encourage him to forgive her. I would have to let him go. So it\u2019s easier for me to let him go now and save myself years of heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you forgetting the years of joy Landon might bring to your life?\u201d</p><p>Jessie knew she wasn\u2019t getting through to him. Didn\u2019t know if she ever could. \u201cMight doesn\u2019t make right.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. You don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too! You have no freakin\u2019 clue what I went through as a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the remainder of the whiskey. \u201cYou met Billy Reynolds. He adopted me, but I still wondered about the man who\u2019d fathered me. I still wished he\u2019d come to his senses and search me out, especially when things were bad at home. I can\u2019t tell you how many hours I spent imagining my \u2018real\u2019</p><p>father would show up and rescue me. He\u2019d admit he\u2019d been searching for me for years, he\u2019d tell me how much he loved me and then he\u2019d take me away. I had those stupid daydreams even when I resented the hell out of him for abandoning me.\u201d</p><p>Brandt stared into the bottom of his empty shot glass. \u201cDon\u2019t you think there were times when I was growing up that I fantasized there\u2019d been some mix up at the hospital and I went home with the wrong people? All kids feel like that at some point in there lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they feel like that all the time because it\u2019s not a fantasy, but reality. So you can\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t know how Landon will feel a few years down the road, because I have a pretty good idea. Better than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting yourself at all costs?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, maybe for the first time in my life. And even you can\u2019t fault me for that.\u201d</p><p>The pointlessness of the conversation prompted her to retreat. Brandt didn\u2019t attempt to stop her.</p><p>In her bedroom, she stripped, slipped on her long johns and crawled in bed, burrowing under the covers because she couldn\u2019t seem to get warm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A while later, Brandt entered the bedroom. She heard his clothes hitting the floor and felt the mattress dip. Then his warm body connected with hers. He wrapped one arm around her waist, one arm stretched under her pillow, tangling their legs together so they were touching from head to toe.</p><p>As Brandt toyed with her hair, so sweetly, so soothingly, Jessie released some of her tension.</p><p>\u201cWe will figure this out, Jessie,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She had figured it out. He just needed to accept it.</p><p>Later, when he thought she\u2019d fallen asleep, and he whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t make me choose, Jessie, please don\u2019t make me choose,\u201d she feared he already had.</p><p>They both had.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only for a few hours. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Jessie scowled at him. \u201cWhy do I have to go?\u201d</p><p>Brandt couldn\u2019t resist kissing her scowling mouth. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t wanna leave you alone on Christmas Day. In and out quickly, I promise. Landon will open his gifts from my mom, we\u2019ll eat dinner and then we\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill your dad be there?\u201d</p><p>Brandt rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve already broken two of my original stipulations,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>And the morning had been going so well.</p><p>Jessie sighed. \u201cFine. Am I supposed to buy a gift for your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys open presents on Christmas Day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we don\u2019t give each other gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, we never really did.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut the year I was there, you guys exchanged gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cNot with each other. Luke told us we\u2019d better get you something since you intended to give each of us a gift. Luke wanted to pretend, for your sake, that we had the same type of normal Christmas everyone else did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t celebrate Christmas at all? Ever?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe must\u2019ve for a while when we were kids. I think Luke broke the news to Dalton that Santa wasn\u2019t real when Dalton was around five. Dalton asked Dad if it was true and that was the end of presents on Christmas morning.\u201d</p><p>Jessie turned back toward the sink. \u201cThat\u2019s sad. Now I really don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my mom loved it the year you were there. Gave her an excuse to put up a tree and do the holiday stuff she hadn\u2019t done in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd gave your father another reason to resent me. Which is all the more reason to be thankful, I guess.\u201d She sighed and sank her hands all the way into the dishwater.</p><p>\u201cThankful for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThankful I didn\u2019t end up like your mom, because God knows I was headed that direction. Luke McKay\u2019s mouse-like wife who wouldn\u2019t rock the boat even if it was about to go sail a waterfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw you that way, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one.\u201d</p><p>Brandt curled his hands around her hips and bent his head to taste that sweet section of skin below her ear. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m the only one who matters.\u201d</p><p>She murmured, \u201cBrandt,\u201d but she didn\u2019t attempt to pull away.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d His lips moved up to nibble on her earlobe, \u201cLandon is napping. Wanna get nekkid and wild?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe when I finish the dishes.\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d and yanked her hands out of the water, spinning her to face him. \u201cI haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to you if you\u2019d rather do the dishes than do me.\u201d</p><p>Jessie laughed. \u201cI am feeling neglected. We only had sex once yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouch.\u201d He kissed her hard. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>A trail of clothes littered the floor from the kitchen to where they were naked on the couch.</p><p>Brandt was ready to be inside her the instant his bare ass hit the cushion and he had a naked, wiggling Jessie on his lap. But he forced himself to slow down. To take the time to marvel that this gorgeous, sexy, spontaneous woman wanted him. That she was his.</p><p>But for how long?</p><p>Forever, if he had his way, but he knew Jessie wasn\u2019t ready to hear that from him yet. He didn\u2019t believe if it came right down to it she\u2019d walk away from him and Landon, no matter what she said.</p><p>Focus on the nekkid woman in front of you, man.</p><p>He kissed down the delectable arch of her neck. Once his mouth reached the upper swell of her breasts, he urged, \u201cLean back.\u201d</p><p>Jessie placed her hands on his thighs above his knees, and let her head fall back, giving her body the most beautiful curve, from the tip of her chin down to the angle of her hips.</p><p>Sometimes the woman took his breath away.</p><p>Brandt cupped her breasts in his hand, using his thumb and index finger to tug the right nipple into a tight point. He latched onto the left nipple and sucked. As he switched sides, he rubbed his face on her chest. He loved the sensation of her soft, warm skin against his cheeks. Loved leaving tiny red marks from his razor stubble on her tender flesh.</p><p>She moaned, pressing her chest against his mouth.</p><p>He suckled, nipped and caressed every inch of her pretty tits until he felt her short nails biting into his thighs. Until he caught a whiff of her sweet cream.</p><p>Brandt took her hand and put it on his cock, murmuring, \u201cTake me in, Jess.\u201d</p><p>She drew the tip across her wet folds, catching the rim of his cockhead on her clit, stopping to rub it over and over. When he growled, she splayed her knees, lowered her pelvis and sheathed him completely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Goddamn that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>His greedy hands were all over her skin. Down the softly rounded globes of her ass. The outside contour of her thighs. He reached between them, letting his finger trace the pliant skin stretching to accommodate his dick. Then his finger moved back a fraction of an inch, brushing over the pucker of her ass.</p><p>Immediately Jessie stiffened.</p><p>Brandt kept kissing her neck, stroking the sensitive ring, pressing against the resistance. Using the wetness from her body, Brandt pushed his finger inside her anal passage, up to the second knuckle. He let her body get used to the intrusion before he began to move his finger. Fucking that tight hole in the same rhythm she was fucking him. The muscle clamped down on his finger and he groaned, imagining his cock being squeezed so forcefully.</p><p>\u201cBrandt, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayin\u2019. Seein\u2019 how far you\u2019ll let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s far enough.\u201d</p><p>He lightly scraped his teeth down her throat. \u201cOkay. But I\u2019ll point out that you like my finger teasin\u2019</p><p>your ass while I\u2019m licking your pussy. You like my tongue teasin\u2019 it while I\u2019m licking your pussy too.</p><p>Makes me wanna watch this sweet little hole stretching to take my cock. Don\u2019t you want that?\u201d He pumped his finger in and out, stopping to tease that ring, now that his finger had brought blood to those nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m, ah, not fond of anal sex. It hurts.\u201d</p><p>It surprised him she and Luke had experimented with it, since Luke bragged he\u2019d gone elsewhere to satisfy what he called his carnal needs.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t have to hurt. We could go slow. I bet I could make you like it.\u201d</p><p>Jessie groaned as he flexed his hips and drove his cock in deeper. \u201cYou probably could, but right now I\u2019m liking this a whole bunch. I\u2019m close, but I need it harder.\u201d</p><p>He did too. He slapped her butt. \u201cGet up for a second and turn around.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure fog in her eyes cleared and she frowned at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brandt laid a smacking kiss on her lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not gonna plow into your ass right now. If we switch to reverse cowgirl, I\u2019ll be able to move better.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cFaster.\u201d One more soft smooch. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod yes.\u201d She scrambled off his dick so fast he laughed.</p><p>Scooting to the very edge of the couch, he repositioned her on his lap, facing forward, her knees by his hips. \u201cReach for the edge of the coffee table.\u201d He pressed his hand over her mound, keeping her pelvis tilted so he could toy with her clit.</p><p>She pushed back into him as he drove forward. \u201cThis position should be called frogger with my legs like this,\u201d she panted. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like how my ass is in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love your ass in the air. It\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird.</p><p>But Jessie\u2019s tense body supported her statement. He stroked his thumb side to side on her clit in the way that made her forget everything but how good he could make her feel. \u201cCome on, Jess. Let go. Let it take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. This feels too much like...we\u2019re trying to be circus performers.\u201d</p><p>Her words had the intended effect. He stopped moving. She pushed up to look at him. The uncertainty in her eyes was his undoing. As much as he loved to test their boundaries, their flexibility, there came a point when it wasn\u2019t necessary, like now.</p><p>Somehow he got her turned around. Somehow in the mix of arms and legs and strangely angled bodies, and the tightly pulled thread of need tethering them together, they ended up on the floor. Face to face, skin to skin. He put his lips by her ear and breathed, \u201cJessie McKay, you own me,\u201d and slid inside her.</p><p>Brandt rocked into her. Their pelvises moving in tandem. In opposition. In perfect synchronicity.</p><p>A rush of wetness coated his cock and her cunt contracted around his shaft. He held still, letting her body drag him over the edge. He closed his eyes to lose himself in the moment. To lose himself in this woman he loved.</p><p>As soon as Brandt\u2019s cock quit pulsing and her contractions tapered off, Brandt lifted his head from where he\u2019d buried it in the sweet spot of her neck.</p><p>She grinned. Wickedly. \u201cOn the floor beneath the tree on Christmas Eve afternoon, Mr. McKay?</p><p>Mmm. I feel so very naughty. Probably means Santa\u2019s not coming tonight, huh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say that.

I already fed the animals. I made coffee. And a coffee cake.\u201d</p><p>She whipped around so fast they almost bumped noses. \u201cExcuse me? I must\u2019ve had the covers over my ears. I thought I heard you say you made cake.\u201d</p><p>Brandt smooched her chin. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Made...cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been cookin\u2019 for myself for years, Jess, so I\u2019m not totally helpless in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you were. I would\u2019ve expected you to whip up scrambled eggs. Or oatmeal. But coffee cake?\u201d Did he know how much she loved coffee cake? \u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCaramel. It\u2019s warm and gooey, because you know how much I love warm and gooey first thing in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Jessie threw the covers back. \u201cIf you\u2019re lyin\u2019 to me Brandt McKay, so help me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He tossed her a robe. \u201cCome on. The boy is anxious to open his presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich boy?\u201d she asked his retreating back.</p><p>He turned around and grinned. \u201cBoth of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>Landon raced over and slammed into her knees. He had two speeds, full throttle and idle. She swooped him up. \u201cMerry Christmas, lil\u2019 buckaroo. Should we see if Uncle Brandt\u2019s cake is edible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo agreeable.\u201d She couldn\u2019t resist nuzzling him. He smelled like baby shampoo, orange juice and little boy.</p> <p>Breakfast was fast. Jessie inhaled two pieces of coffee cake and settled in the living room with her new mug that Santa had left for her by the coffee pot.</p><p>Brandt demonstrated how to rip into wrapping paper and it was over. Landon shrieked while shredding every last inch of Christmas paper from his gifts. Brandt had gone a little overboard buying presents, but he had almost as much fun watching Landon rip the paper as Landon did shredding it.</p><p>\u201cSee? That fire truck has a working siren.\u201d Brandt pushed the button and a really obnoxious whoop whoop whoop erupted.</p><p>Jessie stared at Brandt until he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou picked that out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s annoying, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll boys love fire trucks. It\u2019s a right of passage. Besides, if you think this one is noisy? You oughta see what Keely bought him.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered.</p><p>Landon hit excitement overload, ignoring his gifts and sitting in the pile of wrapping paper, throwing it in the air, or at Lexie, or tearing it into smaller pieces.</p><p>Two unopened gifts remained under the tree. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to open your present from me, Brandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wanna go first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m comfy drinking my coffee. You go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Brandt snagged the box from beneath the tree. When Landon saw another paper ripping opportunity, he loped to Brandt\u2019s side. Brandt said, \u201cI suppose you can help me,\u201d as Landon tore away a chunk of paper.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s stomach knotted. Maybe Brandt would think her gift was stupid. She hid behind her coffee cup as he lifted the lid on the box.</p><p>When Brandt froze, her heart fell to her toes. She prepared for a polite look of interest on his face when he finally glanced up. But all she saw was astonishment. \u201cJess. I can\u2019t believe you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still use the wallet you made me. It was one of the best gifts I\u2019ve ever gotten.\u201d She dropped her gaze to her coffee cup but she couldn\u2019t keep from babbling. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you still do leatherwork, which you should, because it\u2019d be a damn crying shame to let that talent go to waste. I\u2019m not sure if you have punches like those, but I thought they were cool and if you don\u2019t like them I can take them back\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then Brandt\u2019s hands were on her face, his mouth was on hers and he was kissing her with such gentleness and gratitude she could scarcely breathe. He pulled away to rest his forehead to hers. \u201cNo one has ever...you are...Jess. Thank you. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d He groaned. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m wishing I could take yours back because it\u2019s nowhere near as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d Brandt pushed the box to her with his foot and sat on the opposite end of the couch.</p><p>Landon bulled his way over to help. Jessie lifted the box onto the coffee table and waited as Landon\u2019s next strategic rip revealed...a machine that shampooed carpets. \u201cWow. Is this really what\u2019s in the box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I remembered one night we were watching TV and an infomercial came on and you said you always wanted one. But it\u2019s kind of lame, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jessie had zero expectations when it came to receiving gifts. She must\u2019ve waited too long to respond because Brandt swooped down and picked it up off the table.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, no biggie, I\u2019ll return it.\u201d</p><p>She stood and tried to snatch the box out of his hands. \u201cHey, that\u2019s mine. You gave it to me, so you don\u2019t get to take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend you like it, Jess, just to spare my stupid feelings. It was a dumb gift idea.\u201d</p><p>She jerked the box away from him and set it aside so she could get right in his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not dumb.</p><p>It\u2019s thoughtful and I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t jumping up and down screaming with joy. But I\u2019m not really a scream-and-jump-up-and-down type of woman.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks were red with embarrassment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Because you know what buying that carpet cleaner proved? That you listen to me. That you pay attention to me. So in my mind, the gift is perfect. Thank you.\u201d She brushed her lips across his.</p><p>One, two, three, four times. By kiss five he was fully on board, kissing her back.</p><p>\u201cUp, up!\u201d Landon said, trying to worm between their legs.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry we weren\u2019t payin\u2019 enough attention to you,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cHow about if we look at some of the toys you\u2019re ignoring?\u201d</p><p>After Jessie listened to Landon beat on the drums for ten solid minutes, she vowed to get even with Keely. She ducked into the bedroom to get dressed for the McKay family feud. She reminded herself she was doing this for Brandt.</p><p>With Landon\u2019s things loaded in the diaper bag, she smooched Brandt on the chin. \u201cNo offense, but I\u2019ll take my own truck. That way if you and Landon wanna stay and hang out after the meal, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat way you won\u2019t get stuck there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Casper will be on his best behavior,\u201d Brandt offered.</p><p>Jessie said, \u201cWanna make a bet?\u201d</p><p>Good thing they didn\u2019t bet on it.</p><p>Casper was a nightmare. Brandt figured his father had been drinking for several hours before they arrived.</p><p>It was the Christmas dinner from hell.</p><p>Casper ranted about everything under the sun from the stupidity of the government, to inflated cattle prices, to his brothers\u2019 idiotic decisions with running the ranch. He wasn\u2019t blatant in calling his sons brown-nosing, suck ups, when it came to their uncles and cousins, but it was heavily implied.</p><p>Dalton and Tell stuffed their faces rather than engage him.</p><p>His mother was up and down throughout dinner, getting this and that. If he hadn\u2019t known better, he\u2019d suspect she was hitting the bottle in between refilling the gravy boat and the bread basket.</p><p>However, for some reason, Casper ignored Jessie completely. He didn\u2019t look at her, didn\u2019t talk to her.</p><p>It was as if she was beneath his notice. Brandt comforted himself with the knowledge Jessie was better off being invisible than in Casper\u2019s line of fire.</p><p>But no, Casper was just sneakier and waited to approach Jessie until Brandt wasn\u2019t around. He\u2019d cornered her by the bathroom. Casper leaned back with a smug smile when Brandt appeared and grabbed Jessie\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on. Mom is dishing up pie.\u201d</p><p>Jessie left immediately following dessert.</p><p>Brandt wished he could\u2019ve left, too, but he stayed to watch Landon rip open more presents. He was glad when Landon had a total screaming fit, because it gave him a valid excuse to leave.</p><p>The long day had taken its toll, and Landon was down for the count early. Brandt bided his time, waiting to talk to Jessie until after they cleaned up the wrapping paper mess.</p><p>She tied the garbage bag and headed outside to dump it.</p><p>He followed her. She hadn\u2019t worn a coat and it was freezing out, so she\u2019d be anxious to get the conversation over fast.</p><p>\u201cWhat did my father say to you?\u201d</p><p>She tried to sidestep him, but he blocked her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. What he said upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s news, Brandt. Just drop it.\u201d</p><p>Brandt grabbed her biceps and ran his palms up and down her arms to warm her. \u201cPlease. If you don\u2019t tell me it\u2019ll just drive a wedge between us, which is exactly what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that you\u2019d taken that old bible verse about a man\u2019s responsibility in taking care of his brother\u2019s widow literally and all I am to you is an obligation. That you\u2019d tire of me soon, just like Luke had.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn good thing he was freezing his ass off, it was probably the only thing keeping his blood from boiling. \u201cThat bastard. You know that\u2019s not true. That I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I do. But it still stings. It pisses me off that he can cut me so deeply so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always had that uncanny ability to know just where to put that knife. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jessie looked up at him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t confront him about this. It\u2019ll just make it worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t. In fact, let\u2019s just forget all about it.\u201d He kissed her cold cheeks. \u201cBecause I believe you\u2019n me have a date with the couch, a bowl of popcorn and a whole pile of westerns.\u201d</p><p>The shadows cleared from her eyes. \u201cSounds good. I need to change into something more comfortable first.\u201d She started toward the house.</p><p>\u201cComfortable? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was thinking my pajamas because I\u2019m freezing my ass off, but I might be convinced to wear something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>She sent him a come and get it smile over her shoulder. \u201cLike...just my skin.\u201d</p><p>Immediate erection.</p><p>He chased her inside, down the hallway and tackled her to the bed. \u201cGreat idea. Let\u2019s have intermission first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make sure you and Landon are bundled up really good. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Jessie glanced at the clock. Granted it was only ten on New Year\u2019s Eve, but it was two and a half hours past Landon\u2019s bedtime. He was holding up pretty well, showing no signs of an impending meltdown, which was in itself a miracle given the rough week they\u2019d had.</p><p>Since Sky Blue closed over the holidays, Jessie had been home with Landon every day, much to Landon\u2019s disappointment. Because ranch work needed done regardless of the holiday season, Brandt\u2019s schedule hadn\u2019t changed and he hadn\u2019t been around. Plus, Joan McKay had caught a terrible cold and didn\u2019t want to expose Landon to it, so Jessie didn\u2019t get a break until Brandt came home.</p> <p>One thing the week had taught her? She wasn\u2019t cut out to be a fulltime stay at home mom if she was blessed with children of her own. During her short pregnancy she\u2019d imagined her days filled with holding and admiring her cherubic babe. Oddly enough, she\u2019d never seen past that idyllic image to the sacrifices that parenting demanded.</p><p>Now that she\u2019d worked in daycare, she appreciated not only the structure and activity it provided, but the chance for the kids to interact with other kids of different ages. Her charges had become enthralled when Ginger and Kane\u2019s babies became part of the daycare. The fact Skylar helped out on the days the twins came really proved to Jessie how much she\u2019d come to consider the people she worked with at Sky Blue her family. Yet, she admired the satisfaction Skylar, Ginger, and India received from having a career outside of parenthood. Not that Jessie faulted those women who chose to stay at home with their children, but it\u2019d moved something inside her, interacting with the women she worked with after she\u2019d started taking care of Landon. Most of them had been in less than ideal situations at some point. It amazed her how they\u2019d been able to turn their lives around.</p><p>Which always led her to thinking about Landon\u2019s mother. Had she reached that tipping point in her life yet? Or would she need a few more years to pull herself together? Brandt never mentioned his conversations with Samantha, but Jessie sensed when he\u2019d had contact with her, because his mood was subdued. Or more likely, his mood reflected that he\u2019d attempted to contact Samantha and she hadn\u2019t been available or responded. Jessie overheard a conversation between Brandt and Tell, where Brandt expressed his frustration with Samantha\u2019s lack of communication since landing in the halfway house.</p><p>Even Skylar had asked what would happen if Samantha wanted to waive Landon\u2019s responsibilities after her release. Jessie didn\u2019t answer, mostly because she wasn\u2019t sure how to answer.</p><p>Fortunately, she had six weeks left to figure it out.</p><p>A rumbling noise sounded and Jessie realized she\u2019d been so lost in thought she hadn\u2019t gotten ready for Brandt\u2019s mystery outdoor excursion. New Year\u2019s Eve hadn\u2019t ever ranked in her top five favorite holidays; actually it was at the very bottom of the list. She was glad Brandt declined the party invite from his cousin Colby. Evidently Keely decided to host a massive slumber party for all of her nephews and nieces and her cousin\u2019s kids, so her brothers, cousins and their wives could have an adult night. She wondered how Jack was faring after his wife volunteered him to help with twenty-some kids under the age of ten.</p><p>By the time Brandt came inside and stomped the snow from his boots, both Jessie and Landon were bundled up. He grinned. \u201cGrab some extra blankets and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The side-by-side Yamaha ATV idled by the steps. Lexie jumped in the back. Landon clapped his mitten-clad hands, shouting, \u201cYef! Yef!\u201d The kid loved riding in the four-wheeler, and having Lexie along was like Christmas for him all over again.</p> <p>Jessie asked, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my favorite spot on the ranch. It\u2019s a full moon tonight and it\u2019s so cold the sky is completely clear of clouds. I thought it\u2019d be fun to take a moonlight ride.\u201d</p><p>Damn. He\u2019d gone the extra mile to set aside time just for them after she\u2019d spent all day taking care of Landon. His thoughtfulness\u2014without expecting anything in return\u2014was just one of the many reasons she loved him.</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d finally come to terms with the fact she\u2019d fallen for him. It felt right. She loved him. She\u2019d said it out loud a few times, practicing how it sounded. Natural? Fake? Desperate? It\u2019d been years since she\u2019d used those particular words and never to any man except Luke. She\u2019d loved Luke and it hadn\u2019t been enough. So she couldn\u2019t help fear history was about to repeat itself. She loved Brandt, but once again, she wasn\u2019t sure if love was enough.</p><p>The wind blown snow crust was solid enough the ATV rolled over the top of the snowdrifts without problem. Brandt tried to follow the tire tracks made from feeding cattle, but the four-wheeler bogged down, so he forged a new path. He was mindful of speed and angle of the dips and rises since Landon sat on her lap. Even so, the somewhat bumpy ride had lulled Landon to sleep.</p><p>The night, though cold, was magical. Due to the brilliance of the moon, the sky wasn\u2019t a solid black backdrop, but a dark gray swath punctuated with silvery stars. Moonbeams bounced off the snow, making the icy crystals dangling from sage plants look like rhinestones. The snow itself sparkled as if the wind had swirled glitter across the land. In all the years she\u2019d lived in Wyoming she\u2019d never seen the harsh beauty appear so enchanted. Dreamlike. With no other sounds or noises or lights, it was as if they were the only ones in the world.</p><p>The ATV scaled a steep rise and they were on top of a plateau. Brandt cut the engine. With the cloudless night, visibility in all directions was unobstructed and they could see for miles.</p><p>\u201cBreathtaking, ain\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I...I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been comin\u2019 here my whole life and I\u2019m still not used to how this view just knocks me flat.\u201d</p><p>Brandt put his arm behind her on the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She\u2019d always known the ranch meant a lot to Brandt. But in that moment, she knew that he was as much a part of this Wyoming land as the soil and the sage.</p><p>\u201cThanks for sharing this with me, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else in the world that I\u2019d rather be with or share it with, Jessie, you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI brought something to help us celebrate the New Year in style.\u201d He reached back in the storage compartment and pulled out a bottle of champagne.</p><p>Jessie laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. That\u2019ll be all kinds of shook up after our trek across the frozen tundra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019ll be nice and cold.\u201d He took off his glove and twisted the wire cage holding the cork.</p><p>Then he slowly eased the cork out and not a single drop foamed out the top.</p><p>She said, \u201cI\u2019m impressed with your pop topping technique. In more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in true redneck style, I didn\u2019t bring glasses. We\u2019re drinkin\u2019 it straight outta the bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>Brandt held the bottle to her lips and she drank carefully, enjoying the cold tang of the champagne bubbles bursting on her tongue.</p><p>Then Brandt drank. They watched the moon move across the sky as they finished the bottle. When she shivered, Brandt pressed his warm lips to hers and murmured, \u201cHappy New Year, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled close to him on the drive home, still taking it all in. The moonlit ride. The majesty of the place he called home. That simple kiss that held more emotion than any words he could\u2019ve said. A feeling of peace, of rightness drifted over her.</p><p>But life was never that easy and she should\u2019ve known her sense of peace wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>When Brandt excused himself after answering his cell phone, Jessie knew something was up.</p><p>He\u2019d been outside for almost a half hour and she began to worry something bad had happened. Phone sex with her not withstanding, Brandt hated to talk on the phone. His conversations where short and to the point.</p><p>Landon smacked his mini dump truck on the coffee table, culling her attention. \u201cCareful, lil\u2019</p><p>buckaroo, you might smash your fingers.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the dump truck to her; she pushed it back. It\u2019d become one of his favorite games, seeing how hard he could push a wheeled vehicle before it sailed off the table. And any time it went flying, he giggled.</p><p>She told Brandt that meant Landon was testing his boundaries.</p><p>Brandt told her that meant Landon was being a boy.</p><p>The truck made the trek over the flat surface eight times before Landon sent it careening over the edge on top of a sleeping Lexie.</p><p>The dog slunk away and now that she was awake, Landon decided it was time to play. He patted her head. Her belly. Lexie put up with Landon hugging her neck, but when Landon tried ride her like a bull, she balked and darted away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brandt returned from outside and Lexie shot out the door. Landon attempted to chase her, but Brandt caught him around his midsection with one hand. \u201cWhoa, it\u2019s cold and dark out there. And if Lexie\u2019s runnin\u2019 from you, she\u2019s got good reason, so you need to stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoggie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if we have that bath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Landon became as limp as a worm.</p> <p>But Brandt was wise to his tricks. \u201cNice try, but you\u2019re getting in the tub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No! No!\u201d echoed down the hallway until the bathroom door shut.</p><p>Jessie told herself if it\u2019d been really bad news, Brandt would\u2019ve told her instead of allowing Landon to distract him. She tidied up the toys, folded up the blankets, swept the floor. By the time she\u2019d finished, a scrubbed Landon barreled toward her and didn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d hit her knees.</p><p>\u201cThat was a fast bath tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp!\u201d</p> <p>She perched him on her hip and he curled into her, nestling his head on front of her shoulder. \u201cI swear when you\u2019re such a sweet-smelling, sweet-acting boy I can almost forgive how you torture my poor dog.\u201d</p><p>She smooched his crown.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna read to him?\u201d</p><p>Jessie looked up and saw Brandt leaning in the doorjamb, wearing a pensive expression. \u201cI\u2019d planned to. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d Brandt smiled. \u201cHe just loves it.\u201d</p><p>A snuggly, attentive Landon was a treat after dealing with his rambunctious ways all day. She settled in the easy chair and grabbed the book on the top of the stack\u2014a book about dinosaurs.</p> <p>Brandt draped Landon\u2019s blanket over him and retreated to the kitchen.</p><p>Landon\u2019s eyes were drooping by the time she finished the story. She tucked him in his crib and he didn\u2019t fuss about not having a bottle.</p><p>She debated whether to crawl in the shower or find out what Brandt\u2019s phone call was about. No contest.</p><p>Brandt sat in the middle of the couch and patted his lap. \u201cC\u2019mere and give me some sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a second. I need a drink.\u201d She poured a glass of water and brought it back to the living room with her. \u201cSo you gonna tell me about the phone call? Or just distract me with sex?\u201d</p><p>His humor vanished.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie remained standing. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell me she\u2019d been released from the halfway house in Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>The muscle in Brandt\u2019s jaw flexed.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cFive days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s just calling you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently she had some stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear you make excuses for her, Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Brandt rubbed the line of his forehead where his hat usually rested. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her choice, it was a court thing. Anyway, she wants to meet with us. Specifically...you.\u201d</p><p>Jessie had the sensation of falling. Air rushing in her ears, her body bracing for that bone jarring impact. Everything blurred.</p><p>\u201cJess?\u201d</p><p>She jumped. \u201cWhat does she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him, but picking a fight to get him to come clean wouldn\u2019t be wise. \u201cWhere and when will this meeting take place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Pizza Barn in Moorcroft at noon.\u201d He paused. \u201cThe day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can take five fucking days to get her shit together and she gives us thirty-six hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe knew this day was coming. It came more than month earlier than we expected, but it\u2019s not a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just supposed to pack his stuff and hand him over?\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s inquisitive eyes trapped hers. \u201cYes. Isn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>No.</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>I have no clue what I want anymore.</p><p>Jessie fought a feeling of panic. However her hand remained steady as she drained the glass of water.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna hit the hay. Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Jess. I\u2019ll come to bed in a bit.\u201d</p><p>In her bedroom her fingers were numb as they worked the buttons on her western shirt. Somehow she stripped. Somehow she crawled in bed. Somehow she found the energy to berate herself for her emotional investment with the pesky kid when she\u2019d sworn she wouldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>Yet, for the first time in her life, somehow she found the strength not to cry.</p><p>Jessie, girl, you\u2019re such a liar.</p><p>Brandt had tried to remain neutral, to see if she would be honest and admit her once hard stance toward long term care involving Landon had softened. But she\u2019d thrust out that stubborn chin, denied it and run away.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t deny what he\u2019d seen tonight. What he\u2019d seen the last few months. Jessie\u2019s patience, kindness, firmness and amusement regarding Landon. She loved him.</p><p>Jessie had been exactly right. Landon would break her heart and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. Because it was his fault. He\u2019d brought that heartache right to her.</p><p>Would she ever forgive him?</p><p>He slipped into bed and spooned in behind her. He appreciated she didn\u2019t feign sleep. \u201cYou wanna talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>You want me to tell you I love you, I\u2019ve loved you forever and I\u2019m relieved I don\u2019t have to choose between you and my nephew?</p><p>Her answer would be nope to that too.</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t told Jessie that Samantha insisted all of Landon\u2019s stuff be boxed up and ready to go.</p><p>Maybe Samantha was proving she had the power. Maybe she was ready to become a parent to her son. He knew Jessie well enough that if he told her about Samantha\u2019s request, she\u2019d obsess about what it meant.</p><p>He called his brothers and asked if they could take Landon tomorrow night, as they\u2019d planned. It might be easier for everyone.</p><p>That was a total fucking lie. This wouldn\u2019t be easy on any of them.</p><p>When Brandt informed her Landon would spend the night with Dalton and Tell, rather than them, Jessie fought her urge to lash out at him.</p><p>We knew this day was coming.</p><p>They\u2019d watched TV like any other night. In bed, Brandt reached for her, like he did every night. His way of dealing with her melancholy wasn\u2019t to match it with sweetness, but to counter it with heat. Lots of heat.</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t been content to stick with the tried and true. After whipping her into a frenzy by making her come three times, once with his fingers, once with his mouth and once with her vibrator, he pushed her on her back. While remaining on his knees, he hooked her right leg over his right shoulder. He turned her lower body sideways so he could imprison her left thigh between the back of his left thigh and his calf. Then he fucked her. He controlled everything. The depth of his thrusts. The spread of her pussy, and the contact point where her clit abraded his groin.</p><p>Oh, it was breathtaking, watching his ferocious man master her. Teach her. Pleasure her. Mesmerized by the fire in his eyes, Jessie had just held on, as her body became his playground. He watched her breasts bounce with every deep thrust. He watched her bring herself to orgasm. He watched his cock shuttling in and out of her pussy. When Brandt started to come, he turned, sinking his teeth into the outside of her thigh right by his head, giving her the sexiest love bite she\u2019d ever had. They\u2019d both collapsed.</p><p>He\u2019d tucked her against his naked body, like he did every night, and drifted off.</p><p>She slept for maybe an hour or two and then she\u2019d lain in his arms, restless. She disentangled from his embrace and snuck out to the kitchen.</p><p>A cup of hot herbal tea didn\u2019t induce sleepiness. She didn\u2019t dare clean or she\u2019d wake Brandt. So she sat on the couch and tried to process everything that\u2019d gone on the last three months.</p><p>Jessie wasn\u2019t sure why Samantha had insisted on talking to her face to face. Was Samantha gauging her fitness as Landon\u2019s temporary guardian before she dropped the bomb she wasn\u2019t ready to resume fulltime parenting responsibilities yet?</p><p>For the past day, Jessie wrestled with the situation regarding Landon, the facts, the fears, the promises given and the promises broken. Mostly she weighed the promises she\u2019d made to herself to keep an almost clinical detachment for the boy, to set a time limit for how long she\u2019d allow herself to care for him. It was laughable now, thinking she could ever protect her heart from such a sweet soul, from Luke\u2019s son.</p><p>It was pitiful that she\u2019d ever even tried.</p><p>Since she\u2019d insisted Brandt didn\u2019t discuss anything involving Landon\u2019s mother, she couldn\u2019t bring up the fact she\u2019d changed her mind about everything. Not until tomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Jessie loitered outside the Pizza Barn in Moorcroft. She kept her phone to her ear, pretending to be in the middle of an important conversation.</p><p>Stop stalling.</p><p>She pocketed her cell and entered the restaurant. Normally she took a second to breathe in the tangy scents of oregano, tomato sauce, spicy meat and cheese, and the earthy aroma of baking crust. But today, she didn\u2019t smell a thing.</p><p>Probably because you\u2019re holding your breath.</p><p>Two tables had customers. One booth held an older couple chowing down on pizza. A petite woman sat in the other booth, stirring a glass of soda. Had to be Samantha.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s heart galloped as she slowly crossed the room and stopped in front of the booth. \u201cSamantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jessie.\u201d She slid into the opposite seat without being asked, and scrutinized the woman without apology.</p><p>Samantha Johnston looked young now, so Jessie couldn\u2019t fathom how young she must\u2019ve looked two and a half years ago. Her body type was slight. Not busty. An air of fragility surrounded her. A feature Jessie recognized because she\u2019d had that same trait when she\u2019d met Luke McKay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re done inspecting me...\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou had to expect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Thanks for coming early. I worried Brandt wouldn\u2019t pass along the message that I wanted to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie frowned. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t Brandt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s very protective of you.\u201d Samantha leaned back into the booth seat and crossed her arms over her chest, almost defiantly.</p><p>The waitress took Jessie\u2019s order and neither she nor Samantha said another word, nor did they look at each other until the waitress dropped off the soda and left.</p><p>\u201cSo why the summons, Samantha? I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t sure this was the best idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I really wanted to thank you in person for all you\u2019ve done for Landon. I...it\u2019s so far above and beyond...\u201d</p> <p>Please don\u2019t get weepy.</p><p>\u201cPlus, I feel I owe you an explanation about a couple of things regarding Luke.\u201d</p><p>Jessie held up her hand. \u201cNot necessary. I don\u2019t need the down-and-dirty details about what went on between you two. Landon is proof enough for me. In fact, I\u2019d rather not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of my A.A. program and rehab assignment is owning up to my past behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologizing for it?\u201d Jessie asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cWould you accept an apology from me?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Samantha blurted, \u201cThe truth is I wasn\u2019t in love with Luke and he wasn\u2019t in love with me. We weren\u2019t star-crossed lovers consumed with overpowering lust or any of that romantic movie bullshit.\u201d</p><p>That caught her attention.</p><p>\u201cFor about a month after we met, we hooked up when he came into the bar where I waitressed. Since it was bar, he thought I was older than I was and I didn\u2019t bother to tell him differently.\u201d Samantha looked away. \u201cAnd I honestly didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass he was married. Sounds terrible, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>Not a question. Jessie reached for her soda to try and wash away the sour taste in her mouth. So Luke hadn\u2019t hidden his marital status. Was he hoping she\u2019d get wind of this affair and leave him?</p><p>Would you have? If you\u2019d known about this young woman, would you have left him?</p><p>No. Not then. Now? Yes. It hurt like a bitch to admit that to herself, but she was done lying to herself.</p><p>\u201cBottom line: I was convenient after closing time and so was he.\u201d She blatantly studied Jessie. \u201cYou surprised?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know what I am. Hurt and mad mostly. During that time I suspected Luke was seeing someone.\u201d But I didn\u2019t have the balls to confront him about it.</p><p>\u201cWe were only together a couple months. I was exclusive with him, even knowing he was going home to his wife after we...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI never begged him to leave you, never wanted anything permanent with him. I broke it off with him a week before he died. No fuss, no muss. When I heard he died, I was sad, but not devastated. Probably not like you were.</p><p>\u201cAfter I found out I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t know what to do. Especially when some of Luke\u2019s bar friends gossiped about how his family shut you out and cut you off completely. I figured they wouldn\u2019t believe me about being pregnant, and I thought they\u2019d do the same to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t matter at the time because I wasn\u2019t sure if I was gonna keep the baby. I\u2019d contacted a couple of adoption places, but they didn\u2019t want to talk to me until the baby was born and I had a better grasp on my plans. I couldn\u2019t even work in the bar because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you decide to keep the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe minute I pushed him out of my body. I never knew I could love like that. I\u2019d never felt anything like it.\u201d She paused to take another sip of her soda. \u201cAnyway, my old boyfriend showed up when Landon was two months old and living with my judgmental aunt was making me crazy, so we moved in with him.</p><p>Mistake. Not only was his mother certifiable, within four months I\u2019d gotten a DUI. When I got my second...Talk about a serious wake up call. I was just lucky Landon wasn\u2019t in the car with me. As I sat in county lockup, I realized I was headed down the same stupid path my mom had taken, drinking too much, relying on random men, leaving my kid with strangers so I could...\u201d Samantha paused, keeping her face pointed at the table, not meeting Jessie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>It was difficult to watch her struggle because Jessie\u2019s first impulse was to comfort and reassure her.</p><p>She squeezed her hands into fists beneath the table and kept her mouth firmly closed.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna play the \u2018my childhood sucked\u2019 card. It sucked getting dumped off whenever my mom got tired of me, but I know I\u2019m not the only one who had a shitty go of it growing up. I know I shouldn\u2019t use it as an excuse to be a shitty mother to my own kid. He deserves better.\u201d</p><p>Was this where Samantha confessed she still wasn\u2019t ready to take on that role? Jessie braced herself, but she couldn\u2019t stop her heart from racing.</p><p>\u201cSo I left Drex and crawled back to my aunt to prove to her I was gonna change. But she refused to believe it, refused to agree to take care of Landon when I went to jail. I panicked. I mean, what was I gonna do? My only option was to tell Luke\u2019s family about his son and hope they could take him in for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve told them about Landon if you\u2019d had another option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. The risk of the McKays taking him away was better than Social Services getting a hold of him and making me prove for the next sixteen years that I\u2019m a fit mother. So when I met Brandt...I trusted him. Immediately. I knew Landon would have family, no matter what happened to me.\u201d Samantha glanced up and locked her teary-eyed gaze to Jessie\u2019s. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve told you the ugly truth, can you be honest with me about something?\u201d</p><p>Somehow she worked up enough spit to speak. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here today because you were hoping you\u2019d get to have Landon a little longer?\u201d</p><p>Jessie was too stunned to answer.</p><p>But Samantha wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cOr were you scared you and Brandt might be stuck with Landon permanently?\u201d</p><p>Inwardly Jessie squirmed. But she supposed the questions weren\u2019t any harder to answer than they were for Samantha to ask. \u201cI had no freakin\u2019 clue. I suspected you\u2019d need time to get your life back together after being in jail and I wasn\u2019t sure how long it\u2019d take. But I know Brandt never would use the word \u2018stuck\u2019 when it comes to taking care of his nephew. He loves Landon. Unconditionally. He would\u2019ve done what needed done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s words, Don\u2019t make me choose, Jessie, please, don\u2019t make me choose, stuck with her.</p><p>Haunted her.</p><p>\u201cLandon is a sweet boy and I liked taking care of him and being a part of his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Being totally open with Samantha about her change of heart, when she hadn\u2019t told Brandt about it yet felt like a breach of trust. Jessie looked at her. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you\u2019re stepping up to your responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy. I made some mistakes. And it might sound like I\u2019ve been brainwashed or something, but being in jail was good for me. Being away from Landon was good for me too. Because now, I understand what\u2019s important in my life, when before...\u201d Her voice wavered. \u201cI love him so much and I want him to know it every day. I want to be the mom who tucks him in every night and reads him bedtime stories. I want to teach him how to do stuff like ride a bike. I want to take him to the park. I want to sign him up for little league when he\u2019s bigger. I want him to have friends. And family. I want to make sure he\u2019s got more to eat for supper than a bag of Cheetos. I want be the kind of mother I never had. I can do it. I know I can do it. I want to do it. Learning to take care of myself and my son is all that matters to me now.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Jessie knew. This woman, given another chance, would be a good mother. She\u2019d be a good person. She\u2019d paid for her mistakes and now she had a chance to make her life right, to move on and to put her past behind her. She deserved the chance to prove it to herself and to Landon. She needed Jessie\u2019s support. Not her scorn. Not her skepticism.</p><p>Keep it light or you will lose it completely. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck because in the last couple months Landon discovered he loves having stories read to him.\u201d</p><p>Samantha wiped her eyes. \u201cReally? I never had extra money to buy him books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a box full of them now. And there\u2019s always the library when he gets bored with them.\u201d</p><p>Jessie smiled. \u201cI had extras from the daycare, and Brandt...well, he and Tell and Dalton had such a great time buying Landon boy toys. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have a whole bunch of stuff to pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I don\u2019t mind. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>She noticed that Samantha\u2019s focus kept drifting to the door. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start my education rehab at the community college in Casper in a couple weeks. They\u2019ve got housing and daycare and I can do work-study during the day, so I can be with Landon at night and on weekends. Since that\u2019s where the halfway house was, I\u2019ve gotten involved with a local A.A. program. My sponsor introduced me to a counselor and he\u2019s really encouraging about making positive forward progress, which is a first in my life, to be honest.\u201d</p><p>All of a sudden Samantha\u2019s face lit up. She made a soft gasp and hopped out of the booth and then seemed frozen in place, as she waited. Was she afraid her son wouldn\u2019t recognize her? Was she afraid Landon would come to Jessie first?</p><p>A dark head streaked past and Jessie heard a shrieked, \u201cMama mama mama!\u201d</p><p>Samantha lifted Landon in her arms, hugging him tight, sobbing, \u201cOmigod, baby, I missed you so so much. I swear I\u2019m never gonna...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMama mama mama!\u201d</p><p>She held him and cried buckets. Through her gasping cries, Samantha babbled, making Landon incoherent promises. Kissing his cheeks. Rubbing his back. Touching him as if his presence might be a dream. Just holding him like she\u2019d never let him get away from her again.</p><p>That softened the knife\u2019s edge of pain a little.</p> <p>Samantha\u2019s eyes drank in every nuance of his face. \u201cLookit you. You\u2019re such a big boy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYef.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, even though she was still crying. \u201cAnd you\u2019re talking too. I\u2019m in for it now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYef.\u201d</p><p>Jessie slipped from the booth, desperate to escape because this was goodbye she\u2019d been dreading since the day she\u2019d first set eyes on him. With her feelings in such turmoil, she was as afraid she\u2019d break down as she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t break down.</p> <p>Landon finally looked at her and those big blue eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cHey, lil\u2019 buckaroo,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He said, \u201cDown,\u201d and wiggled until his mother released him. He ran to Jessie hell bent for leather. His contact with her was more of a body check than a hug, which made her laugh. She squeezed him with one arm and placed a kiss on top of his head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>Jessie expected him to squirm away, because even at nineteen months the kid had a time limit on hugs, especially when his uncles were around. God forbid if a McKay\u2014of any age\u2014appeared too girly.</p><p>But Landon didn\u2019t race away. He heaved a contented sigh against her neck. Then he moved back and placed a sticky hand on each of her cheeks. He locked his serious gaze to hers and gave her a kiss, square on the mouth. He emitted a noise deep in his throat, then he raced back to his mother.</p><p>It took about ten seconds to sink in.</p> <p>Landon had acted exactly like Brandt. Holding her face. Kissing her. Making that possessive growl.</p><p>Her heart absolutely turned over. Landon had just told her, in his little boy way, that he loved her.</p><p>Good thing she\u2019d crouched down because she didn\u2019t think her knees would hold her.</p><p>But Brandt was already helping her up, giving her his full support.</p><p>Tell said to Samantha, \u201cWe loaded all the stuff in your car so you\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>So Brandt had known Samantha planned to take Landon with her. He had to\u2019ve known packing up Landon\u2019s things would cause her pain and anxiety, so he simply hadn\u2019t mentioned it to spare her. Would she ever get used to the way he put her needs first?</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Samantha buttoned her coat. Then she picked Landon up and held him very close. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you guys enough for what you\u2019ve done for us. I\u2019ll never be able to repay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakin\u2019 good care of him from here on out will be payment enough,\u201d Brandt said.</p> <p>\u201cThat I can promise. I\u2019ll keep in touch about visitation and stuff.\u201d She fastened the Velcro under Landon\u2019s chin, securing his hood. \u201cWe\u2019d better hit the road, huh, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYef.\u201d</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Samantha and Landon walked away.</p><p>Jessie couldn\u2019t move. She was frozen in mind. In body. In spirit.</p><p>Brandt turned her around, trapping her face in his hands, wiping her tears, kissing her lips, her cheeks, the corners of her eyes.</p><p>How long they stood there, Jessie didn\u2019t know. At least until the server asked if there was a problem.</p><p>Brandt grabbed Jessie\u2019s hand and led her outside to take her home.</p><p>Jessie stared out the window and Brandt didn\u2019t push her to talk. However, he wouldn\u2019t let go of her hand. He needed that constant connection to her.</p><p>She mumbled something about chores as soon as he shut the truck off. Her distraction could be dangerous so he followed her into the barn. When she slipped on a pair of coveralls, he did too. They worked side by side in silence, spreading hay to feed the horses and the llamas. She checked the stock tank to make sure it hadn\u2019t frozen since this morning. She did everything on autopilot. Brandt wondered how long before she\u2019d crash.</p><p>Inside her trailer, neither she nor Brandt remarked how bare the living room was without Landon\u2019s toys strewn all over the rug. Without his bottles clogging the fridge. Without his trucks, cars, trains and books scattered across the coffee table. Even Lexie seemed out of sorts. She\u2019d wander to the door, to Landon\u2019s room, then make a pitiful whine before she curled up in the kitchen in the spot where his high chair stood.</p><p>Brandt finally forced her to look at him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Seeing her...Samantha. She\u2019s not what I expected. I sort of felt sorry for her. Then I realized I shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for her. She might not have much but she\u2019s got what I always wanted from Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But that\u2019s not all I\u2019ve been thinking about...I\u2019m having such a hard time getting the words to make sense. And you need to know, Brandt. You deserve to know.\u201d Tears shimmered in her eyes and she looked so...lost.</p><p>\u201cGod. Jess. You\u2019re breakin\u2019 my heart. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do something. Anything. Go to a movie, or go out dancing, or go play pool, just get me out of this house and out of my head for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Brandt understood Jessie would be okay. For the first time all day the tight feeling in his chest loosened a little. \u201cGreat idea. We\u2019ll hit Applebee\u2019s in Spearfish for supper first and then we\u2019ll slip on our dancin\u2019 shoes at the Rockin\u2019 R outside Beulah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my lucky night, finding Brandt McKay at the bar first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowdy, stranger. I haven\u2019t seen you in ages.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, keeping his eye on the door and not on Lydia\u2019s display of cleavage. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she cooed. \u201cI worried you might\u2019ve found Jesus and were shunning honkytonks and temptations of the flesh or something noble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d He\u2019d given into the temptations of Jessie\u2019s flesh more times than he could count. In more ways than he could count. That thought brought a smile to his face.</p><p>\u201cLord, that sexy grin of yours still makes me weak kneed.\u201d Lydia leaned in, toying with the buttons on his shirt. \u201cI remember putting a smile like that on your face a time or ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld news, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say...everything old can be new again.\u201d</p><p>Brandt laughed. Hard to believe he used to find this type of hardcore desperation attractive. He finished his beer and set the empty on the bar. \u201cNice talkin\u2019 to you. See you around.\u201d He started to leave.</p><p>But Lydia wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cDon\u2019t run off. Lemme buy you another beer for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Then dance with me. Please? None of these guys dance as good as you. You could go for hours without getting tired.\u201d</p><p>Lydia could be very persuasive and sadly, Brandt wasn\u2019t immune to her flattery. Besides, Jessie had just stepped outside to take a call from her mom about what\u2019d happened with Landon today. \u201cOkay, one dance. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>They zigzagged through the crowd on the dance floor. Lydia spun into his arms, like she\u2019d done dozens of times when they\u2019d been dating, but the flirty move annoyed him. He clasped her hand and started two-stepping. At least the fast tune would keep them from talking.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lydia wasn\u2019t deterred by the music\u2019s pace. \u201cSo whatcha been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanch work.\u201d He twirled her, resetting the distance between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna ask me what I\u2019ve been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo good, probably,\u201d he muttered and twirled her again.</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019 bad feels so good, doesn\u2019t it. You used to think so, too, cowboy.\u201d She spun herself and brushed her ass against his groin. \u201cOr do you need a little reminder?\u201d</p><p>This had been a mistake. Lydia had gone from persuasive to conniving. He managed a curt, \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh. \u201cWith the uptight way you\u2019re acting, I believe you might\u2019ve found religion after all.\u201d</p><p>No. He\u2019d found something better. Jessie.</p><p>Brandt tuned out Lydia\u2019s suggestive comments, maintaining a bland expression as his eyes kept darting toward the exit. What could be taking Jessie so long?</p><p>Thank God the song ended. Brandt immediately dropped Lydia\u2019s hands and attempted to retreat as the dance floor cleared.</p><p>But Lydia wasn\u2019t having any of it. She herded him backward even as he tried to dodge her. When the creases of his thighs hit the stage, he caught the edge to keep from falling on his ass. Lydia took advantage, slithering between his legs. She wound her arms around his neck like twin anacondas, unhinged her jaw and swallowed his face.</p><p>Jesus. Brandt felt like he was choking she\u2019d jammed her tongue so far down his throat. He stood abruptly, expecting that\u2019d dislodge her, but she clung to him like a deranged monkey.</p><p>Goddammit. Enough. He put his hands on her hips, intending to shove her away as he tried to dislodge his mouth from her fangs.</p><p>They were roughly pulled apart. \u201cWhat the hell is goin\u2019 on here?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flew to Jessie. Holy fuck was she pissed off. Brandt immediately got to his feet.</p><p>Lydia coyly wiped her mouth. When she sidled closer to Brandt, Jessie inserted herself between them and snapped, \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Brandt just got carried away, didn\u2019t we, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth, Lydia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Lydia pouted, without an ounce of remorse. \u201cI was just trying to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s fury-darkened eyes never looked away from his. \u201cIs it true, Brandt? Did you and Lydia get carried away?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her expression shifted. She whirled to face Lydia. \u201cYou get your kicks out of kissing an unwilling man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sugar, don\u2019t kid yourself for a second he was unwilling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Lydia smiled cagily. \u201cWhat are you gonna believe? What you saw with your own eyes? Or what he tells you? \u2019Cause, you\u2019re awful damn na\u00efve if you don\u2019t think he\u2019ll lie about what just happened to spare your feelings.\u201d</p><p>Direct hit. Brandt needed to get Jessie out of here now. \u201cJessie\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s laughter cut him off. \u201cYou want proof?\u201d She pointed to Brandt\u2019s groin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a hard-on. If anything you did even turned him on a little, he\u2019d be sporting wood. Trust me, I know. So, sugar, take your desperation to some other man because Brandt is not interested in you.\u201d</p><p>But Lydia wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cSo you\u2019re Jessie. The poor little widow whose husband couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants.\u201d She gave Jessie a derisive head-to-toe inspection. \u201cNo wonder he wandered. Looks like you\u2019re trying\u2014and failing\u2014to prove you can keep the interest of another McKay man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut your stupid mouth. You don\u2019t know a goddamned thing about Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit a nerve, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you hitting a nerve.\u201d Jessie leapt at Lydia.</p><p>Lydia screamed as they hit the floor, Jessie\u2019s fists flailed as she tried to connect with every part of Lydia\u2019s body she could reach. Then Lydia bucked and sent Jessie sprawling. But that didn\u2019t stop Jessie from crawling back and pouncing on her.</p><p>Brandt had never seen Jessie enraged. She\u2019d wind up in jail for assault if any of her punches actually landed. He crouched down, wrapped both arms around her middle and lifted her off Lydia.</p><p>\u201cLet me go! I\u2019m gonna beat her ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you made your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not done. She doesn\u2019t understand that she doesn\u2019t get to say shit like that about you. I\u2019m gonna make her understand if it takes all goddamn night!\u201d</p><p>He held her, hugging her back to his chest, attempting to contain her. \u201cJess. Baby. Calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fucking bitch attacked me,\u201d Lydia said as she picked herself up off the floor. \u201cYou all saw it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone who\u2019d gotten closer to watch the catfight walked away. Not a single person stuck around to back up Lydia\u2019s claims.</p><p>Brandt figured they\u2019d best leave too. He loosened his hold on his surprising hellcat.</p><p>Mistake.</p><p>Jessie broke free and loomed over Lydia, who finally had the good sense to cower like a whipped pup.</p> <p>\u201cStay away from him, do you hear me? I will fuck you up if I ever see you looking at him again. And if you ever touch him, I swear to God I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...we\u2019re done.\u201d Brandt picked Jessie up, snagged their coats off the chairs and carried her out of the bar.</p><p>As soon as they were outside, she thrashed and said, \u201cLet me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise me you ain\u2019t gonna make a break for it and go back inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch would deserve it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t release her until they reached his truck. He tossed her the long duster and slipped on his jacket. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m too fucking mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wanna try scream therapy again, we need to get out of town first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanna punch something. Or someone. But since you won\u2019t let me do that...\u201d She kicked a clump of dirt. Tracked down another and kicked it too.</p><p>Brandt watched her, unruffled by this violent side of his sweet Jessie, mostly because he understood it. \u201cWhy did you go after her like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she had her hands on you. Because she was kissing you. God. She had no right. Are all women so desperate? Didn\u2019t she know better than to throw herself at another woman\u2019s man? In public, no less.\u201d</p><p>He froze. His brain backtracked. Wait a second. Jessie hadn\u2019t gotten pissed off because of what Lydia had said about her or Luke, she\u2019d gotten pissed off over Lydia lumping him in with all other cheating men in the world. Hope like he\u2019d never experienced filled his chest. Somehow he managed to keep his tone even when he asked, \u201cSo do you make a habit of this?\u201d</p><p>Jessie snorted. \u201cFighting? Not hardly. I\u2019ve never wanted to kill anyone with my bare hands as much as I did the second I saw her plastered to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve never had a woman fight over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never had a man worth fighting for.\u201d</p><p>Brandt erased the five feet between them, forcing her to look at him. \u201cRun that by me one more time.\u201d</p><p>Jessie, his sweet fiery Jessie, didn\u2019t stay passive. She slapped her hands on the sides of his face and locked her gaze to his. \u201cYou are the one man in the world I will fight for, Brandt McKay, because I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Before you jump to the conclusion that I\u2019m telling you this now when Landon isn\u2019t in the picture, you\u2019d be partially right. What I didn\u2019t say earlier today before Landon left with his mother was that I\u2019d never make you choose. But now that he\u2019s gone I was afraid that you don\u2019t need me anymore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince all I wanted you for was Landon\u2019s childcare?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd all you wanted me for was sex?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his. \u201cNo. But did the high emotions and intensity of the situation and the hottest freakin\u2019 sex on the planet heighten everything between us?\u201d</p><p>The knot of fear in his belly tightened. Oh hell no. He was not losing her now. \u201cLet me make this clear, Jessie. I love you. I\u2019ve loved you for a long goddamn time, even when I shouldn\u2019t have loved you. I know you love me\u2014even when you were too stubborn or scared to admit it. I see it whenever you look at me. I feel it when you\u2019re touchin\u2019 me. So I cannot for the life of me understand why you\u2019re questioning this now. Now when we have no obstacles and a lifetime ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want a clean slate about everything. That includes the big \u2018what if\u2019 scenario that\u2019s been hanging between us for three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Samantha had shown up today and asked you to continue as Landon\u2019s guardian without specifying how long, I would\u2019ve pulled up my big girl panties and stayed by your side where I belong. I would\u2019ve found a way to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>This woman...goddamn, she could knock him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI want you in my life, Brandt. So if part of your life is caring for your brother\u2019s son, then that makes it part of my life too. Whatever black and white view I had of this situation with Landon in the beginning changed over the past few months. I care about him. I care what happens to him.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m happy we had him for as long as we did. But seeing how much Samantha loves him and how happy he was to see her...I know he belongs with his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why I asked you to help me. Because you\u2019ve got a big heart and you\u2019re willing to put it out there, even if there\u2019s a chance you might get it stomped on. Jessie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She placed her thumbs over his lips. \u201cUs being together won\u2019t be an easy road. There will be people like Lydia, like your father, who will want us to fail. So you should know I fell in love with you not because you\u2019re Luke\u2019s brother, but in spite of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve become everything to me in ways Luke never was. I never imagined I\u2019d find a man like you, who\u2019s sweet, sexy, funny, thoughtful, kind. A man who makes me feel like I\u2019m enough for him. A man I can trust without question. A man I will fight anyone for.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears and she whispered,</p><p>\u201cGod. I feel like such an idiot because you\u2019ve been here the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Brandt wiped her cheeks. \u201cYou weren\u2019t ready to see me in any of those roles in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you waited until I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you were so shocked when I told you I wanted more than a family type relationship, I realized too late you still needed more time. Come to find out time was good for me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe years you were married to Luke, it hurt me to see how he treated you. After Luke died, I made myself available, hopin\u2019 you\u2019d see me as the man who could heal you. And you took what I offered, but gave me nothin\u2019 in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Brandt kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cI know you are. I also know it wasn\u2019t intentional. In the last few months, I\u2019ve gotten to know you, the real Jessie, not the idealized version I\u2019d built up as the woman I was determined to save. Not the woman who needed me only as her handyman and grief counselor. Not the woman I lusted after. I realized what I felt before wasn\u2019t love. Because now? Now I understand what real love is. It\u2019s this.\u201d He lowered his mouth and kissed her, loving how she wrapped herself around him as if she\u2019d never let him go. He broke the kiss with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought I\u2019d be confessing my love to you in the damn parking lot of a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought it\u2019d take a hair pulling fight to prompt me to tell you how I felt about you.\u201d Jessie rubbed her lips across his and whispered, \u201cPromise you won\u2019t stomp on my heart, Brandt McKay. I swear it would crush me in a way I\u2019d never recover from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. I love you. So will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened. But something stopped her from answering.</p><p>\u201cYou do understand that I won\u2019t be like Luke? I promise to be faithful to you forever. I don\u2019t see fidelity as an option clause in marriage vows.\u201d</p><p>Jessie bit her lip and stared at him with those wide eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me hangin\u2019 now,\u201d he half-snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family?

Say no?\u201d Brandt kissed her. \u201cNothin\u2019 would be worse than not havin\u2019</p><p>you in my life, Jess. Nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen if you\u2019re sure...Yes. I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>He whooped and spun her around, not noticing the cold, or anything else except the look of happiness in Jessie\u2019s beautiful eyes that he knew mirrored the happiness in his soul.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p> <p>Brandt would rather have a root canal without anesthesia than talk to his father.</p><p>He knocked on the front door of the house he\u2019d grown up in.</p><p>His mother answered, dishtowel in hand, as usual. \u201cBrandt. Sweetie, it\u2019s good to see you. You don\u2019t need to knock. Come in. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something I wanna talk to you guys about.\u201d</p><p>She kept her expression neutral. \u201cGo into the dining room. Your dad\u2019s in there. I\u2019ll be right in with coffee.\u201d</p><p>Brandt rounded the corner and saw his dad sprawled in his padded captain\u2019s chair at the end of the big oak table. He stopped out of habit to gauge his father\u2019s mood.</p> <p>If Casper McKay was happy he\u2019d push back in his chair and tip his hat up to meet your gaze. If Casper was out of sorts, he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge your presence at all.</p><p>Brandt studied him. In the last two years he\u2019d aged ten. His black hair was mostly gray. The deep blue of his eyes had faded into the hue of old denim. His eyebrows were still black, still drawn together in a frown. The firm set to his mouth gave the appearance of a permanent scowl. His lean face and long neck flowed into a hard, tight frame, a body weathered on the wide-open spaces of Wyoming. A mindset that was as cold, hard and unforgiving as the land that\u2019d forged him.</p><p>No smile. No \u201cHow are you?\u201d just a calculating stare and a curt, \u201cBrandt.\u201d</p><p>Definitely in a piss poor mood.</p><p>Brandt left his hat on and he grabbed the back of the dining room chair in front of him. \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou here for a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, spit it out.\u201d</p> <p>His mother brought Brandt cup of coffee and refilled Casper\u2019s cup before attempting to hightail it out of the room. Brandt snagged her elbow. \u201cStay. I want you to hear this too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and slipped into the chair on her husband\u2019s right side.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon\u2019s mother picked him up yesterday and they\u2019re gonna be livin\u2019 in Casper. After they get settled she wants to talk about visitation rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOughta be the other way around. She oughta be here askin\u2019 us for visitation. That boy belongs with his family. If you\u2019d hired a decent lawyer that specializes in these cases\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that ambulance chasin\u2019 bozo from Cheyenne? Wrong. Besides, Landon belongs with his mother.\u201d Brandt glanced at his mom, but she was busy studying the floral pattern on the placemat.</p><p>\u201cSo you here to gloat that you got what you wanted? My only grandson taken away from me?\u201d</p><p>Like Casper had paid any attention to Landon while he was here. He didn\u2019t want him, but he didn\u2019t want anyone else to have him either. \u201cNo. I\u2019m here to tell you that I\u2019m marryin\u2019 Jessie.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>His dad slowly stood. \u201cIs this some kind of goddamn joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you, Brandt? It ain\u2019t enough that she made your brother miserable, and that misery got him killed?\u201d</p><p>He retorted, \u201cShe had nothin\u2019 to do with Luke\u2019s car accident. And I ain\u2019t gonna argue with you about who was more miserable in their marriage because neither you nor I lived with them. But that\u2019s all in the past now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPast? Sounds like you\u2019re not putting her in the past where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she belongs with me. Her future is with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right? So she spread her legs for you. Big fuckin\u2019 deal. Don\u2019t mean you gotta tie yourself\u2014and us\u2014to her again. The only good thing to come outta Luke\u2019s death was her leaving.\u201d</p><p>This was a fucking nightmare, way worse than he\u2019d anticipated. \u201cShe didn\u2019t leave voluntarily. You forced her out. Which was the shittiest thing you\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSo you say. And you ain\u2019t exactly unbiased, are you?\u201d</p><p>Count to ten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m marryin\u2019 her and there\u2019s nothin\u2019 you can do about it.\u201d</p><p>His dad moved closer, a sidewinder about to strike. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be too sure about that, son. Don\u2019t forget who owns this ranch and who pays your wages.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s fingers tightened on the back of the chair. \u201cIs that a threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stating the facts. Everything you\u2019ve got, except that pitiful chunk of land you and your brothers bought, comes from me. And I can take it back any goddamn time I want. Your name ain\u2019t on the papers, boy, mine is.\u201d</p><p>Before Brandt could say a word, his mother stood. \u201cCasper. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>The mean glint intensified. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything I damn well please, and it\u2019s time this boy really understood that. So if you insist on tyin\u2019 yourself to that woman in any way, you won\u2019t inherit a single inch of McKay land. And you know I don\u2019t bluff.\u201d</p><p>At that moment his dislike for his father bloomed into full-blown hatred. The next thing Brandt knew, he\u2019d pushed the smarmy son of a bitch into the wall and pressed his arm across his father\u2019s windpipe, holding him in place.</p><p>He vaguely heard his mother say, \u201cBrandt, stop,\u201d but the rage had overtaken him.</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you something, you mean goddamn bastard, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done puttin\u2019 up with your bullshit excuses for why you haven\u2019t turned the ranch over to your sons. I\u2019m done with you lording it over us. We\u2019ve been runnin\u2019 this ranch since before Luke died, not you.\u201d</p><p>Casper choked on his own spit as he tried to say something.</p><p>But Brandt wasn\u2019t about to let him speak before he said his piece. \u201cSo if you think you\u2019ve got it in you, old man, to do everything yourself, then by God, I\u2019d like to see you try. But we both know that won\u2019t happen, will it?\u201d</p><p>When his father didn\u2019t respond, Brandt eased up on his chokehold. \u201cAnswer me, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so fuckin\u2019 smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it don\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that you\u2019ve got no one in your life to help you if I walk away from the ranch. Tell and Dalton won\u2019t stick around. And you\u2019d rather let this place fall into ruin and let the cattle starve before you\u2019ll ask your brothers for help, wouldn\u2019t you? So yeah, chase me off. You go on out there in the bitter fuckin\u2019 cold and deal with feeding twice a goddamn day. Good luck with calving season and everything else that it takes to run this ranch, since you haven\u2019t done a goddamned thing for close to ten years. Ain\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I owe you something? I don\u2019t. I owe you nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Brandt got right in his dad\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve busted my ass for years even when nothin\u2019 I ever did pleased you. I\u2019ve put up with your bullshit. I\u2019ve watched you prefer the company of a twelve pack to the company of your wife. I\u2019ve watched you destroy any chance of a relationship with me, Tell and Dalton, because you\u2019re pissed off at God and the universe that we\u2019re here and Luke isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did. And it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, least of all Jessie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she woulda made him happy, he wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for it all over the goddamn county. That little bitch made him miserable from the day he married her. And she\u2019ll make you miserable too. Mark my words.\u201d</p><p>Brandt shoved him again, hard. \u201cI\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 sick and tired of you running off at the mouth about her. You don\u2019t know a thing about Jessie. You never have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt. Let him go.\u201d</p><p>He felt rather than saw Tell and Dalton move in behind him. But he couldn\u2019t make his hand release his father\u2019s shirt. He couldn\u2019t move his arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on, bro. This isn\u2019t helping.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed and Brandt finally let go and stepped back.</p><p>A smirk twisted his father\u2019s face. \u201cFelt good, didn\u2019t it? To give in to that anger? I saw it in your eyes.</p><p>No matter what you say, no matter how hard you try, you know the truth. You\u2019re just like me.\u201d</p><p>Infuriated, Brandt lunged for him again, but he got there too late.</p><p>Tell had pinned their father against the wall. \u201cShut it, old man. Brandt may\u2019ve gotten the hair trigger temper from you, but my anger has been smoldering for years and I guarantee you don\u2019t want me to give in to it. Ever.\u201d Tell shoved him once and stepped back.</p><p>Their dad\u2019s eyes slid to Dalton. \u201cWhat? You ain\u2019t gonna tell me how long you\u2019ve been gunning for me? Waitin\u2019 for the day to beat the crap out of your old man?\u201d</p><p>Dalton said nothing.</p><p>He laughed cruelly. \u201cStill actin\u2019 like a boy, letting our brothers do all the talking, taking all the punishments to save your precious hide. How long before they realize you ain\u2019t worth it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. All of you,\u201d his mother said, sobbing. \u201cStop it right now.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Brandt glared at his father, his rage a living thing.</p><p>\u201cYou can have her or a stake in the ranch, Brandt, but not both. You choose.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at his brothers or his mother as he picked up his hat and left.</p><p>Jessie had just gotten back from feeding the animals when she noticed Brandt\u2019s truck was parked in front of her trailer. No sign of him. He\u2019d probably gone inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without saying anything to her? That was strange. Brandt always searched her out when she did chores. Always.</p><p>Maybe he was tired. Yesterday was long and emotionally trying for both of them. Not to mention he\u2019d kept her up half the night, making love to her until they fell asleep still joined\u2014which had been a first for her, and more romantic than she\u2019d imagined. Draped across Brandt\u2019s warm body, her head nestled under his chin, her knees curled by his hips with his cock still embedded inside her, his hands cupping her ass.</p><p>She\u2019d woken up a couple hours later when he hardened inside her. He rolled her over and made love to her again, whispering words of devotion. Declaring his undying, never-ending love for her. Making promises she actually believed.</p> <p>It\u2019d been the greatest night of her life.</p><p>Smiling, she dropped the bucket and the pitchfork next to the gate and raced to the house. She burst inside. \u201cBrandt?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Lexie lifted her head and gave her a crabby look for disturbing her nap.</p><p>Huh. That was weird. Brandt\u2019s boots weren\u2019t on the rug. His clothes weren\u2019t hung up on the coat tree.</p> <p>She kicked off her overshoes and walked down the hallway. \u201cBrandt? You okay?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in the bathroom.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in the bedroom.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d just missed him and he was in the barn.</p><p>As Jessie was slipping her boots back on, she heard her cell phone beep, indicating she had a voice mail. She snatched the phone off the coffee table and checked the missed calls. Tell had called. Four times in the last hour.</p> <p>Her stomach sank to her toes. She dialed her voice mail and listened to the first of two messages.</p><p>\u201cJessie. Brandt is on his way there. Or I assume he\u2019s on his way. He\u2019s not answering any phone calls from me or Dalton and...Jesus. We\u2019re freaked out. It didn\u2019t go well with Dad today and...Just call me, okay?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t go well? What the hell did that mean? The next message started to play.</p><p>\u201cJess, I know I already left you a message, but it\u2019s really important you get back to me right away and let me know you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ve never seen Brandt like this.\u201d</p><p>Never seem him like this. Like what? Why would Tell be worried that Brandt would hurt her? Brandt would never ever hurt her.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s worried that Brandt will hurt himself.</p><p>Oh God. No.</p><p>Fear spiked her pulse. Jessie tore down the steps and sprinted to the barn. But when she reached the side barn door, which had been left ajar, she skidded to a stop. Busting in on him was a bad idea.</p> <p>She slipped inside as quietly as possible. The familiar scents of hay, manure, dirt, grain and grease didn\u2019t offer the usual comfort, especially when she heard harsh grunts and the hard and fast thud thud thud of one object striking another.</p><p>The sound of a chain rattling echoed from the tack room. A sound she recognized. The heavy bag.</p><p>She crept to the back of the barn and froze.</p><p>Any relief that Brandt was taking out his aggressions on the punching bag fled when she saw all the blood. Spattered on his face. On his bare chest and arms. Bloody streaks smeared on the canvas cover of the bag. His knuckles were raw. His forearms were scraped from elbow to wrist. Bloody scrapes spread across both his shoulders.</p><p>He\u2019d taken off his shirt to inflict the most possible damage to his body. His neck and chest and abs were coated with a mixture of sweat and blood. When Jessie found the guts to look at his face, she couldn\u2019t withhold a gasp. His hair was plastered to his head. His face was bright red, the muscles in his jaw flexed with every punch he threw. The veins in his neck bulged to the point she could see his pulse pounding. His forehead and cheeks and chin were wet, but she couldn\u2019t tell if it was from sweat or tears. But it was his eyes that stopped her. She recognized the rage and grief. She didn\u2019t recognize the feral light that made him look like a wild animal, incapable of rational thought.</p><p>He\u2019s hurting himself. Stop him.</p><p>But Jessie was frozen in that place between logic and fear. What if she stepped in and he was so far gone he somehow hurt her? Without knowing what he was doing? Brandt would never forgive himself.</p><p>Can you forgive yourself if he has an aneurysm and you stood by and let it happen?</p><p>No. That snapped her out of her trance, watching Brandt beat the heavy bag and himself to a pulp.</p><p>\u201cBrandt.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>She said it louder. \u201cBrandt.\u201d</p><p>Still no response.</p><p>Jessie moved closer. \u201cBrandt. Stop. You\u2019re hurting yourself.\u201d</p><p>Without missing a punch, he said, \u201cGo away. You don\u2019t want to be around me right now.\u201d</p><p>Left punch, right punch, left jab, right jab. She stood there long enough to memorize the pattern. Her gut tightened into a knot when she noticed the skin peeling back from his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and nailed the heavy bag harder. \u201cGet the fuck out of here, Jessie. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t dealt with a pissed off man before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like me. Never when I\u2019m like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I can handle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Landon, throwing a little boy tantrum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 push me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 shut me out.\u201d</p><p>Brandt made a roaring noise and started whacking his forearms into the bag. Left, right, left, right each blow harder than the last. His need to grit his teeth to deal with the new pain he was imposing upon himself was the last straw.</p><p>Jessie lost it. Angry tears, frustrated tears, scared tears all poured out at once and she screamed at him, pulling the canvas bag away from him. \u201cGoddammit Brandt, stop! Stop it! You\u2019re hurting yourself. You\u2019re hurting yourself and it\u2019s killing me. My God. Please. Just stop.\u201d</p><p>The flying arms slowed, then stopped. Brandt leaned forward, chest heaving with every ragged breath, his body shaking as he rested his forehead to the heavy bag and wrapped his arms around it to keep himself upright.</p><p>She stumbled behind him, pressing her face into his sweaty back, molding her body to his. Holding him as he vibrated with rage, holding him as he bled, trying to hold them both together.</p><p>Brandt\u2019s voice was a whisper of pain. \u201cI hate him. I fucking hate him. I never...\u201d His voice broke and once again they were locked in hellish silence. \u201cI never wanted you to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>Jessie understood him not wanting to show weakness to others, but she thought they\u2019d gone beyond that. \u201cSo why did you come here, Brandt? To my house?\u201d</p><p>Another long silence. Then his soft, \u201cBecause I had no place else to go.\u201d</p><p>Angry tears formed and she released him. \u201cSo I\u2019m a last resort now?\u201d</p><p>He whirled around so fast he bumped into her, knocking her off balance and sideways. In super slow-mo she crashed into the wooden slats, hissing as a splinter sliced her cheek, gasping as she twisted her body to land on her hands and knees, sucking in a harsh breath as gravel and hay dug into her palms and her knees skidded out from underneath her.</p><p>Then Brandt was roughly hauling her upright. His grip on her biceps hurt, but she sucked up the pain.</p><p>The little sting was nothing compared to the damage he\u2019d exacted on himself. She looked at him.</p><p>The agony in his eyes stole her breath. \u201cOh God, look at you. You\u2019re bleeding. I did that. I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Brandt recoiled in horror. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo where? Brandt, you don\u2019t even have a shirt on\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stumbled back, turned and walked out.</p><p>Don\u2019t let him go. Not like this.</p><p>Jessie snatched up his clothes and chased him down, planting herself right in front of him. \u201cAt least put your goddamn clothes on if you\u2019re leaving me.\u201d</p><p>He ducked his head and grabbed the bundle. But he didn\u2019t deny he was leaving her.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me. I deserve that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve much better than a man who lashes out in anger and hurts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it still happened. It can happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it. Tell me what the hell happened with your dad today.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, he yanked his shirt on, then his coat. He finally looked at her. \u201cI need some time.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She went dizzy. Her legs, her world threatened to go out from under her. Gritting her teeth, she locked her knees to keep them from buckling. \u201cTime for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to think.\u201d He gently moved her aside from blocking the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cGo inside before you freeze to death.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t seem to make her feet move. She watched him drive away.</p><p>She stood there until the wind picked up and snow swirled around her. Until Lexie\u2019s barks roused her and she trudged inside, absolutely numb.</p><p>Her entire body shook. She stripped down and stayed under the shower spray until she drained the water heater of every drop of hot water. She dressed in her warmest flannel pajamas before she started a pot of coffee. But she couldn\u2019t get warm. She put a healthy dollop of whiskey in it before she dialed.</p><p>He picked up on the second ring. \u201cJessie? What the hell is goin\u2019 on? I\u2019ve called you like a dozen times. Have you seen Brandt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left.\u201d</p><p>A pause, then, \u201cHe left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. After he beat the shit out of my heavy bag and himself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, did he hurt you?\u201d Tell demanded.</p><p>\u201cIntentionally? No. But he thinks he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I have no idea what\u2019s going on. He said he needed some time and he took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So maybe you oughta tell me what happened today.\u201d</p><p>Seemed a full hour passed before Tell spoke. \u201cSome of this I heard from Mom, some of this I saw firsthand. Brandt told Dad you two were getting married. Dad, bein\u2019 Dad, spewed bullshit. Told Brandt he\u2019d have to choose between you and his portion of the McKay ranch, because he couldn\u2019t have both.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her Irish coffee threatened to come back up.</p><p>\u201cThen Brandt threw Dad against the wall and that\u2019s when me\u2019n Dalton came in.

He always has.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her head back and closed her eyes. \u201cBut he loves that ranch too. That\u2019s all he\u2019s known.</p><p>That\u2019s all he\u2019s ever wanted was to take over running it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think our Dad don\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that once Casper has drawn the line in the sand, he won\u2019t erase it, he won\u2019t move it, and he sure as hell won\u2019t back down from it. Brandt will have to choose.\u201d</p> <p>A muttered curse, followed by, \u201cYeah, it sucks, but he will.\u201d</p><p>Poor Brandt hadn\u2019t wanted to choose between her and Landon. He\u2019d dodged that bullet only to have the gun waved in his face again. As much as she wanted to be the one he\u2019d pick, as much as she wanted to plead her case and offer him assurances that their life together would be worth giving up his heritage, she couldn\u2019t. She wouldn\u2019t. She had to give him the time to decide, even if it damn near killed her, so he wouldn\u2019t have regrets about his choice.</p><p>Even if she did.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Brandt couldn\u2019t go to his trailer, couldn\u2019t go to Tell\u2019s place or Dalton\u2019s place, couldn\u2019t go to Ben\u2019s.</p><p>Definitely couldn\u2019t go back to Jessie\u2019s.</p> <p>His entire body burned with shame. After he\u2019d left his folk\u2019s house, he\u2019d driven to Jessie\u2019s on autopilot. But once there, he realized he didn\u2019t want her to see him in such an extreme state of anger. So he thought he\u2019d take the edge off by using her heavy bag.</p><p>Everything was a blur after that. Until he saw Jessie watching him. Every ounce of shame surfaced.</p><p>It defied logic when she\u2019d wrapped herself around him, offering him comfort when he should\u2019ve been reassuring her that he wasn\u2019t an animal.</p><p>An animal that\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>His beautiful, sweet, kind, loving Jessie had blood on her face. Blood he\u2019d brought forth in anger. It\u2019d made him absolutely sick.</p><p>He\u2019d had to get out of there.</p><p>He needed a place to think things through.</p><p>He\u2019d ended up at the bunkhouse. It sat empty for most of the year, only used during calving and haying season. Or when one of his cousins and their wives needed alone time, hence the nickname the nookie shack.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t easy to get to, especially not in a snowstorm. Equipped with food, water and a bunkbed, Brandt figured he could crash a couple days before anyone thought to look here.</p><p>He fired up the wood stove and set a pan of snow on the top to melt. He\u2019d need to clean himself up since his wounds were starting to sting. But his adrenaline rush was history and he crashed. He hit the bed with his boots on, his clothes on, his gloves on, in too much pain to do anything but groan before he passed out cold.</p><p>Brandt dreamed of Luke.</p><p>The old Luke. The brother he\u2019d laughed with and worked with and worshipped his whole life. The brother he\u2019d mourned more than anyone other than Jessie had ever known.</p><p>They sat around a campfire, drinking icy cold Fat Tire, staring at the black sky overloaded with stars.</p><p>The silence between them wasn\u2019t awkward, as it\u2019d been the last few years.</p><p>Brandt sipped his beer, taking in the wide-open space. It wasn\u2019t anywhere he and Luke had ever been.</p><p>Everything about it seemed...too perfect. He looked at his brother. \u201cSo, is this heaven? Or hell?\u201d</p><p>Luke shrugged. \u201cNeither, really. I guess you\u2019d call it neutral ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. It\u2019s your dream, bro. I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>Brandt winced. He wondered how much this dream brother knew about what\u2019d happened in the past few months.</p><p>\u201cI know about you and Jessie,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThen you know I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really hate me for that, Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I felt guilty. I should\u2019ve let you have her that first night. I shouldn\u2019t have tried so damn hard to prove that I was the better man. When it\u2019s always been obvious that you are the better man. In all respects.</p><p>It kinda pisses me off.\u201d Luke smirked, and flicked the cap of his beer bottle at Brandt, like he always used to.</p><p>\u201cHey! What was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld times\u2019 sake.\u201d Luke\u2019s intense gaze didn\u2019t waver. \u201cNone of that past stuff matters anymore. You are doin\u2019 the right thing by her?\u201d</p><p>Brandt kept his cool since he\u2019d already lost his temper once today. Granted, he doubted this dream embodiment of Luke could swing back. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d pick a chunk of dirt over Jessie? Do you really think I\u2019d walk away from her now when I\u2019ve got everything I\u2019ve ever wanted?\u201d</p><p>Luke shrugged again. \u201cI figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s important. I won\u2019t be like you, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No excuses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any excuse for what I did. I just wanted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your blessing?\u201d Brandt poked in the fire with a long stick, close enough he felt the heat burning his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need that from me. Just havin\u2019 her in your life will be blessing enough.\u201d</p><p>When Brandt looked up from the fiery red embers, Luke was gone.</p><p>He woke up gasping, coughing from the campfire smoke, his knuckles smarting from being too close to the fire.</p><p>But as he pushed himself upright, he remembered where he was. In the bunkhouse, which accounted for the smell of smoke. He glanced down at his hands, hot because they were still encased in gloves.</p><p>That explained it.</p><p>But still...What a weird fucking dream.</p><p>Brandt tossed another log on the fire, downed four aspirin and returned to the bunk. His clothes were stuck to his body with a mixture of blood and sweat, but he couldn\u2019t muster the energy to clean himself up.</p><p>He managed to toe off his boots. As he took off his coat, something pinged on the wooden floor. Despite the shooting pain in his arms, he reached down and caught the circular object on the tip of his finger.</p><p>A metal cap from a bottle of Fat Tire beer.</p><p>No. It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>He spun around the room, half-expecting to still be in that alternate reality, praying everything today had been some kind of twisted dream. His father gleefully cutting him out of his heritage. Losing his mind in a fit of rage in front of Jessie and hurting her. Hoping the walls of the bunkhouse would disappear and he\u2019d see his brother, sitting by the campfire, drinking beer and grinning at him. Just like old times.</p><p>But nothing changed.</p><p>Took Brandt really long time to fall asleep after that.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Day 1</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t stopped by. He hadn\u2019t called. Jessie went about her Sunday routine as usual. Cleaning.</p><p>Washing clothes. Paying bills. Feeding the animals. Cooking a pot roast with all the trimmings\u2014enough food for two.</p><p>Day 2</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t stopped by. He hadn\u2019t called. Jessie took advantage of the Monday holiday to work with her horses. Then she fed the animals. She drove to the store for ice cream. She watched TV. She called her mother. She fell into bed alone.</p><p>Day 3</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t stopped by. He hadn\u2019t called. Jessie couldn\u2019t face going into work at Sky Blue so she called in sick. And she was heartsick. She curled up on the couch with Lexie. She drank tea and ate toast.</p><p>Between the bouts of sniffles, she checked her phone to make sure the damn thing was working. She fed the animals. She heated up a can of soup and shuffled off to bed alone.</p><p>Day 4</p><p>Brandt hadn\u2019t stopped by. He hadn\u2019t called. Just how much time did the man need? But Jessie couldn\u2019t face Skylar or India or Kade or Kane or Ginger or Simone without breaking down completely. She needed another day. Despite the guilt, she called in sick.</p><p>Jessie assumed the person rapping on her door at ten a.m. would be Skylar. Jessie considered ignoring it, but it\u2019d be easier to \u2019fess up here, rather than in an official capacity at Skylar\u2019s office. She shushed Lexie and opened the door.</p><p>Joan McKay stood on her porch. She looked different but Jessie couldn\u2019t put her finger on what it was about her that was off.</p><p>It hit her. Jessie grabbed Joan\u2019s arm. \u201cHas something happened to Brandt?\u201d</p><p>Joan shook her head. \u201cAs far as I know Brandt is fine.\u201d</p><p>She sagged against the doorframe. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Sorrow flickered in Joan\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh sure.\u201d Jessie poured two cups of coffee while Joan took off her coat and settled on the couch. She handed her a cup. Did she sit next to her former mother-in-law? Or keep her distance, like she always had?</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Jessie sat beside Joan on the couch. \u201cYou never were one just to stop by to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sad is that? Anyway, I wanted to clear a couple of things up before I...\u201d She set her cup down on the coffee table with a resounding thud. \u201cActually, I want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not standing up to Casper after Luke died. I\u2019ve convinced myself I was so lost in grief I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. But the truth is, making waves wouldn\u2019t have changed anything, Casper does what he wants and to hell with everybody else. That was how I justified my \u2018head in the sand\u2019 behavior when it came to you and everything else in that situation. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jessie didn\u2019t know what to say. She watched Joan struggle, this woman she\u2019d always seen as torn between her duty as a wife and as a mother.</p><p>\u201cAnd I should\u2019ve tried harder to have some kind of relationship with you, Jessie, after you and Luke got married. Casper didn\u2019t like you, and I figured after you lost the baby early on, he\u2019d do everything to break you and Luke up.\u201d She distractedly rubbed the center of her forehead. \u201cI felt bad for you, but us being friends would\u2019ve just pissed Casper off even more and he would\u2019ve taken it out on both of us. And Luke. Trust me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKnow what I never understood? Why Casper hated me so much in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Joan drained her coffee and walked to the kitchen. Almost on automatic, she poured herself another cup, but it sat cooling untouched on the counter for several excruciating minutes while she stared out the front window.</p><p>Jessie followed her, a feeling of dread settling in her bones. \u201cJoan? Is everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how wrong it is. All of this.\u201d She braced her hands on the counter in front of the sink. \u201cCasper hated you because your bun-in-the-oven marriage to Luke reminded him of me. Of us.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was news. Luke had ever mentioned it. Or maybe Luke hadn\u2019t known. \u201cYours was a shotgun wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you shocked?\u201d</p><p>Jessie had to tread lightly. This was the most Joan had ever opened up to her. \u201cYes. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Casper ended up with someone like me?\u201d Joan asked, not bothering to hide her petulance.</p> <p>\u201cNo. The opposite. I can\u2019t fathom how a woman like you ended up with a man like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are sweet,\u201d Joan murmured. Then she sighed. \u201cThe truth is, at one time, Casper was considered quite a catch. He came from a good family. His future was set as part of the ranching McKays.</p><p>He was good-looking, charming, fun, wild as hell, but that bad boy side is always so appealing, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Why do women have this overwhelming desire to tame a bad boy? Then we\u2019re shocked when that taming doesn\u2019t happen. Or worse, when it does stick we lament the man they used to be.\u201d</p><p>Joan seemed lost in thought so Jessie stayed quiet. But she hadn\u2019t seen Luke as the bad boy to tame.</p><p>Brandt was the polar opposite of a bad boy, so it wasn\u2019t a female mindset she understood, but she\u2019d seen friends drawn to that type of man again and again and it rarely ended well.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, I wasn\u2019t particularly pretty. I wasn\u2019t particularly charming. I wasn\u2019t particularly clever. I was actually pretty plain. I knew plain, shy and boring would never catch the eye of a dynamic man like him. And I wanted him more than anything on earth.\u201d</p><p>As hard as she tried, Jessie couldn\u2019t make the connection between that man Joan was describing and the Casper she knew.</p><p>\u201cCasper had half a dozen girls on the string at any given time. So I became the type of girl he couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d She paused for effect. \u201cEasy. He\u2019d come to me after his pretty, clever, charming little girlfriends wouldn\u2019t put out. He came to me often because I\u2019d do anything in bed he wanted. Any time, any place.</p><p>\u201cThis went on for about six months. At first I believed I could get him to fall for me. That our bedroom romps would make him like me. Would make him willing to have me on his arm in public, instead of just his dirty little bedroom secret. I dreamed he\u2019d take me dancing. Or out for dinner. But like most nineteen-year-old girls, I was na\u00efve. I\u2019d heard a rumor from my friends that Casper was getting serious with a woman from Spearfish. One night I snuck into his favorite bar and watched them. She was one of those beautiful blondes, curvy body, perfect face, life of the party. She was everything I wasn\u2019t. I knew Casper was head over heels in love with her. I knew after the first time he took her to bed I\u2019d never see him again.\u201d</p><p>Jessie held her breath.</p><p>\u201cSo I lied. I told my father I was pregnant. Told him I\u2019d been sneaking around with Casper McKay for months. My father went directly to Jed McKay and demanded his son do the right thing and marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I was happy. Obviously Casper was not. I\u2019d hoped I\u2019d get pregnant for real right away and ours wouldn\u2019t be a relationship based on a lie. When four months passed and I wasn\u2019t showing, I faked a miscarriage. It was a lot easier to do in those days. Ten years passed before I got pregnant and by year five Casper figured out I\u2019d tricked him.\u201d</p> <p>She felt sick. Everything was clicking into place but it didn\u2019t make it easier to accept or understand.</p><p>Joan reached for her coffee and drank before continuing. \u201cHe flew into a rage and said I\u2019d ruined his life, which was probably true. It was the only time he ever hit me. He left and didn\u2019t come back for a week.</p><p>And when he came back, he was a different man entirely.</p><p>\u201cI was so...grateful he hadn\u2019t thrown me out and so relieved he still wanted to bed me, that I lived solely for him to make up for the lie and the trouble I\u2019d caused. Like any man, he got used to using me doing everything for him, never questioning him. By the time we started having the boys, he\u2019d turned into bitter. He took out his frustration with how his life turned out on them\u2014as a punishment to me, not to them, because he knew how much I loved our sons. He ostracized his brothers. And I was still too afraid that he\u2019d leave me, proving every fear I\u2019d ever had about my worth, so I did nothing. I kept my mouth shut.</p><p>For years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke died. And Casper has become more bitter, if that\u2019s possible. When we found out about Landon...\u201d Joan turned around but she wouldn\u2019t look Jessie in the eye. \u201cIt sliced me to the quick to discover that Brandt didn\u2019t trust me with Luke\u2019s child. Not because I\u2019d be cruel to the boy, but because I wouldn\u2019t stop Casper from being the same way to Landon that he\u2019d been to his own sons.\u201d</p><p>God. This was so ugly. So unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cThese are my mistakes, Jessie, and I\u2019ve owned up to them. But the final straw? When Casper told Brandt to choose between the ranch and you. When he told me that our child would never be welcome in our home again. When he told me he never wanted to see Brandt again.\u201d Joan lifted her head and met Jessie\u2019s gaze. \u201cI won\u2019t lose another son. I won\u2019t lose Tell or Dalton either. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>Was Joan looking for a place to stay? Or just moral support? Jessie wasn\u2019t sure and didn\u2019t want to make a misstep with Brandt\u2019s mother after she\u2019d reached out to her. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already done it. I\u2019ve left my husband.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s mouth fell open in shock. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve done it long ago. So when he raced over to talk to his brothers after cutting Brandt off, I packed up and lit out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing between Carolyn\u2019s, Kimi\u2019s and Vi\u2019s. They\u2019ve rallied around me, which has been nice. But...\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s time I moved on. We\u2019ve been miserable together for so long, maybe we have a chance to find happiness if we\u2019re apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where will you go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Casper.\u201d Joan expelled a nervous laugh. \u201cFunny, huh? That I\u2019m leaving Casper to go to Casper? After I found out about Samantha and Landon, I visited Samantha in jail a few times. Poor thing doesn\u2019t have anyone in her life she can rely on. She needs help and she\u2019s accepted my offer to be there for her and Landon. He\u2019s such an unexpected joy. I haven\u2019t had much joy in my life lately. At sixty-two years old I feel I\u2019m due.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be living with them?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cClose by. I\u2019ve got a cousin who\u2019s agreed to let me stay with her temporarily. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be staying there. Luckily I won\u2019t need to get a job, not that I\u2019m qualified for more than cookin\u2019 and cleanin\u2019 anyway, because I\u2019ve got the \u2018mad\u2019 money I\u2019ve been saving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad money?\u201d Was that like...egg money or something?</p><p>\u201cEvery time Casper got mad about something, I put a dollar in the jar. You can imagine I\u2019ve got a tidy pile after forty years.\u201d</p><p>That did cause Jessie to smile. Until she realized she might be the first one Joan had confided in.</p><p>\u201cDoes Brandt know you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I talked to Dalton and Tell last night and I stopped at Brandt\u2019s house right before I came over here.\u201d</p><p>Her heart leapt at the mention of Brandt\u2019s name. \u201cOh. So he\u2019s home then? Not at the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be at the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause...hasn\u2019t Brandt...I mean\u2014\u201d spit it out, Jessie, \u201c\u2014he hasn\u2019t...Fine. I haven\u2019t seen or heard from him so I thought he\u2019d already made his choice.\u201d</p><p>Joan placed her hand on Jessie\u2019s forearm in such an uncharacteristically loving gesture Jessie\u2019s heart stalled. This couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cJessie. Brandt loves you. There never was any question in anyone\u2019s mind who he\u2019d choose. Including his father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Before relief swept through her fully, she demanded, \u201cThen why haven\u2019t I seen him for four days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta be asking him that, instead of me.\u201d</p><p>Jessie realized Joan was exactly right. No more of this giving him time, waiting around for him to come his senses bullshit. The old Jessie would stand around and wring her hands and wait for him to come to her. The new Jessie, the Jessie who\u2019d found the man of her heart and soul, needed to go to him first. As soon as humanly possible. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you for listening to me babble. It actually felt good to get that off my chest.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t tell Brandt or his brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. It\u2019ll be just between us girls.\u201d</p><p>Joan did the oddest thing: she tugged Jessie against her for a fierce hug. She whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I hope you\u2019ll give me another chance to be part of your lives. I like you, Jessie. I\u2019d like to get to know you.</p><p>I\u2019d like to put all that bullshit from the past aside and start fresh.\u201d</p><p>Jessie said, \u201cThat sounds like a great plan, Joan,\u201d and really meant it.</p><p>As Joan McKay drove off, Jessie finally realized what was different about the woman. She actually looked...happy for a change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessie wanted that same happiness for herself. Dammit. She deserved it.</p><p>And the only way to get it was to take it.</p><p>After she changed into work clothes, she hitched the empty horse trailer to her truck and headed out.</p> <p>Butterflies danced in her belly as she drove down the long driveway leading to Brandt\u2019s house. By the time she reached the banks of snow piled by the deck, Brandt stood on the steps, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cJess? What are you doin\u2019 here with a horse trailer?\u201d</p><p>She scaled the stairs in one step and got right in his face. \u201cDid you mean what you said? When you told me you loved me and wanted to marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your dad to take a flyin\u2019 leap as far as the ranch is concerned?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the past four days when you haven\u2019t contacted me at all,\u201d she lightly cuffed him in the arm, \u201chave you had any regrets about anything that\u2019s been going on between us in the last few months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then what are you waiting for? Let\u2019s get your stuff packed up and loaded in the trailer so we can take it back to my place.\u201d</p><p>Brandt circled her biceps, stopping her. \u201cWhoa. Wait a second. Do you know what\u2019s happened? I\u2019ve lost my identity, my job, and I\u2019ve got a limited skill set in the world outside ranching, I\u2019m damn close to destitute and you\u2019re...\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cChipper as a damn squirrel about that.\u201d</p><p>Jessie laughed. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t offer you anything.\u201d</p><p>She knocked free of his hold and grabbed him by the lapels to get nose to nose with him. \u201cNow you listen to me, Brandt McKay. I love you. You. Not your ranch, not your station in life as part of the McKay ranching dynasty. You\u2019ve already offered me everything I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifetime with you.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes softened. \u201cJess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare back out on me now. So we\u2019ve hit yet another rough spot. So? Ain\u2019t the first time and I doubt it\u2019ll be the last. But I have every faith we\u2019ll overcome it. Together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best man I\u2019ve ever known. You are worth fighting for. We are worth fighting for. I love you. I love you so freakin\u2019 much. Don\u2019t give up. Please.\u201d She moved even closer, completely invading his space. \u201cSay something, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if you\u2019d left me get a word in edgewise.\u201d He brushed his lips across hers. \u201cI missed you.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI love you.\u201d He kissed her again. \u201cGod, do I ever love you.\u201d One last smooch to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><p>Her heart damn near stopped. \u201cToo late for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo help me pack. Everything is already loaded in the back of my truck.\u201d</p><p>Then she kissed him. Jessie wanted to kiss him with all he hunger and passion he always gave her, but it was hard to keep their lips attached when all she could do was smile.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d he murmured against her mouth, much later, as they were twined together in his bed. \u201cWhat prompted you to come after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fear that you changed your mind and decided I wasn\u2019t worth all the hassle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat hassle?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a light head butt. \u201cOh, a little thing like your dad making you choose between the ranch and me.\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that the day you showed up and killed my poor heavy bag?\u201d</p><p>That flash of shame appeared, heating his cheeks. \u201cI get in these...rages, Jess. They\u2019re ugly and I\u2019m mean. I come out swinging and don\u2019t stop until everything and everybody in front of me is leveled. Or until someone hands me my ass or I pass out. Fun stuff.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m so goddamn sorry that I hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to. And it hurt me a helluva lot worse when you walked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was some stuff I needed to work out.\u201d Maybe someday he\u2019d tell Jessie about the bizarre dream he\u2019d had about Luke.</p><p>\u201cSo you really picked me? Over the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo contest.\u201d</p><p>Brandt and Jessie had started loading tack into the horse trailer when a pickup pulled up. Jessie tensed. The pickup looked exactly like Casper\u2019s but Brandt knew the pickup belonged to his Uncle Carson.</p><p>He watched as all three of his McKay uncles climbed out of Carson\u2019s truck. Carson and Cal were twins, not identical, but that wasn\u2019t obvious at first glance. Charlie had the same look about him as his brothers did, but he was shorter, stockier. As far as McKay family dynamics, Charlie should\u2019ve been last on the pecking order as the youngest son. But it\u2019d always been Casper, the oldest of Jed McKay\u2019s sons, at the bottom of the heap.</p><p>Strange, seeing his uncles here. They rarely ventured to this part of the ranch, and never to Brandt\u2019s house. So they must\u2019ve gotten wind of Casper\u2019s ultimatum. Brandt\u2019s pride appeared, reminding him he didn\u2019t need his uncles\u2019 charity.</p><p>He told pride to shut the fuck up.</p><p>\u201cBrandt.\u201d Carson removed his glove, thrust out his hand and Brandt shook it, then he shook Calvin and Charlie\u2019s hands in kind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t gotta ask why you guys are here,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cBut I do wanna know who called you.\u201d</p><p>Carson shoved his hands in the front pocket of his Carhartt coat. \u201cActually Casper contacted us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat surprises me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised the hell out of me too,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cJesus. The man showed up at my place out of his mind.\u201d</p><p>Brandt frowned. \u201cYour place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, guess he considers me the weakest link in the McKay chain of command.\u201d Charlie shot his brothers a sideways glance. \u201cBut that\u2019s always been Casper\u2019s problem. We\u2019ve never had the \u2018me\u2019 versus</p><p>\u2018them\u2019 mentality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he has.\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded. \u201cAs soon as he showed up Vi called Carson and Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he...\u201d How could he ask his uncles if his dad had told them he\u2019d attacked his father?</p><p>Cal clapped Brandt on the shoulder. \u201cSon, we know what he\u2019s like. Which is why we all needed to be there. Been brewing for a long goddamn time. It\u2019s time we dealt with it.\u201d He looked at Jessie with that trademark charming McKay smile. \u201cDarlin\u2019, if you wouldn\u2019t mind givin\u2019 us some time with Brandt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Brandt and I are a package deal now. Whatever you intend to discuss with him can be said in front of me. Rest assured, I\u2019ll never repeat what I hear, but Brandt and I have had too many family things between us, keeping us apart for too long.\u201d</p><p>Brandt had such a fierce sense of pride, such an overpowering feeling of love for this woman. He reached for Jessie\u2019s hand. Right then he knew he\u2019d never have to worry where he stood with her, because she\u2019d always stand beside him.</p><p>Jessie said, \u201cIt\u2019s too damn cold out here. Let\u2019s head inside.\u201d</p><p>After outerwear was removed, Brandt passed around beer. He sat in the easy chair with Jessie perched on the arm beside him. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019d like to hear what my dad said to you before I tell you what really happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t pretty, Brandt. Just figured I oughta be up front with you about that,\u201d Cal warned.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper said things\u2019d gone to hell in a hand basket since Luke died. He\u2019d entrusted you with the ranch and you\u2019d make some piss poor decisions and he no longer trusted your judgment.\u201d</p><p>Jessie threaded her fingers through his.</p><p>\u201cWhen we pressed him for solid facts, Casper sputtered something about you convincing your brothers to buy more land, when the three of you couldn\u2019t take care of what you already had.\u201d Charlie grunted. \u201cCourse, that\u2019s when we pointed out for the last two years, since you\u2019ve taken over, your calves had a higher weight ratio than ever. Then I told him you boys buying that grazing land, even when you had to put yourselves in hock for it, was one of the smarter decisions anyone\u2019s made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasper didn\u2019t wanna hear that,\u201d Carson pointed out. \u201cHe also didn\u2019t wanna hear us tellin\u2019 him that he hadn\u2019t been pullin\u2019 his weight for damn near a decade. And that if it hadn\u2019t been for his sons bustin\u2019 ass, we would\u2019ve redistributed his parcel amongst the three of us and our sons.\u201d</p><p>A feeling of pride and dread surfaced simultaneously. Brandt and his brothers had done everything to make their part of the McKay ranch as successful as the others. But with their dad overruling them, they\u2019d lost some of what they\u2019d gained. \u201cWhat was his response?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical Casper blustering. Told us if we thought we could do a better job, then we could go ahead and buy him out.\u201d</p><p>Brandt went motionless. Not only would Casper McKay cut him out, he\u2019d cut out Tell and Dalton from their heritage too. He took a long swallow of beer and met his Uncle Carson\u2019s gaze, managing to keep his voice steady. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took him up on it.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Brandt felt as if he\u2019d been sliced in two.</p><p>\u201cNow before you go getting that look on your face, son, hear us out. You know we\u2019ve been restructuring several aspects of the ranch over the last few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase mentioned it, so did Kade, but I\u2019ll admit Casper kept us in the dark. Whenever we asked, he refused to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded. \u201cChase said as much. Which let us know that anything we were doin\u2019 had to be completely above board. It also forced us to look very closely at the past legal documentation for the ranch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And what Dash Paulson found sort of shocked us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were under the impression that if just one of us wanted to sell our portion of the ranch, the other three owners would be forced to sell theirs too. Which is how Casper tried to control us, or at least got away with a lot more shit than we would\u2019ve let him, had we known the real legalities of the matter.\u201d</p> <p>Carson pointed with his beer bottle. \u201cIt entails lots of legal gibberish that took us slow readin\u2019</p><p>ranchers some time to understand, but the bottom line is we were wrong. Casper never had the power to force us to sell.\u201d</p><p>Brandt held up his hand. \u201cWait a second. My dad threatened to sell his portion of the ranch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral times over the years. To be honest, he even went as far as to have it appraised about six months after Luke died.\u201d</p><p>That son of a bitch. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo he could point out what idiots we were for keepin\u2019 it, when we could have more money in our pockets than we could ever spend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much money we talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>The three brothers exchanged a look. Then Carson met his gaze. \u201cOn paper? Over eighty million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo yeah, Casper thought he had the ace in the hole, thinkin\u2019 if we wanted to buy out his portion of the ranch, it\u2019d cost us over twenty million dollars each. Which none of us have in cash obviously.\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked at Cal. \u201cWhat is the legal discrepancy the lawyer found?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, my daughter in law is one smart cookie. Ginger and her dad pored over the paperwork the last couple days and discovered a clause written into the original trust that\u2019d been forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMajority rules,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cWe\u2019d intended to talk to Casper about it, but he\u2019s been such a prick...\u201d He looked at Jessie. \u201cSorry, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone knows how much of a prick Casper can be, it\u2019s Jessie.\u201d Brandt kissed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m assuming he told you the choice he gave me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He said he wanted you off the payroll and to treat your departure the same as we had when Chase, Carter, Cam and Keely opted out of the land trust.\u201d</p><p>Seemed his father really did want to leave him destitute.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course, we said no.\u201d Carson grinned. \u201cThen we sprang the \u2018majority rules\u2019 clause on him. Which means we all have a say in what happens to his portion of the ranch, but only as it relates to naming his successors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t take over or sell his portion of the ranch, but we can give control to his descendents. So you, Tell and Dalton now call the shots. Your father has officially been retired from ranching. He\u2019ll still receive a portion of the profits, but as far as the day-to-day operations and decision makin\u2019? You and your brothers are in charge.\u201d</p><p>Brandt couldn\u2019t keep his jaw from dropping. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. But we should also point out in doin\u2019 this we couldn\u2019t single out your father. So me\u2019n Cal and Charlie all officially retired too. The fourth generation of McKays are now one hundred percent in charge of the McKay cattle company and the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you knew this all when my dad came to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We listened to him, told him we\u2019d hafta wait until Monday to talk to the attorney. Then Tuesday we met up and told him what we\u2019d decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he take it?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged another look and Cal spoke. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say a lot, Brandt, bein\u2019s that he was dealin\u2019</p><p>with your mother leavin\u2019 him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t tell him where Joan\u2019s been stayin\u2019,\u201d Carson said. \u201cCaro and Kimi and Vi have spent the last few days helpin\u2019 her...hell, I don\u2019t know what the four of \u2019em have been doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>A minute or so of awkward silence hung in the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d Carson asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout a million. But they\u2019ll keep. Wait, there is one, since I went off her grid for a few days.\u201d He sent Jessie an apologetic look. \u201cDid you talk to Tell or Dalton about any of this?\u201d</p><p>Charlie shook his head. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we haven\u2019t told our sons about it yet. Wanted to let you know first, since it changes everything for you and your brothers.\u201d</p><p>That floored him. He\u2019d gone from flipping through the classifieds to find work to finding out he had a bigger stake in the ranch than before.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt our boys will be on board, happy to be kickin\u2019 the old men to the curb,\u201d Carson said dryly.</p><p>\u201cLittle do they know we\u2019re gonna be watchin\u2019 them closer than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, only thing that\u2019ll change is we ain\u2019t haulin\u2019 our asses outta bed to do chores at the crack of nothin\u2019 any more,\u201d Cal said.</p><p>\u201cA benefit of bein\u2019 retired,\u201d Charlie added. \u201cEffective immediately.\u201d</p><p>All three men laughed. Then they stood.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best get on our way so we can have this same conversation again. Luckily, all the boys will be together later this afternoon so we\u2019ll only have to do it once.\u201d</p><p>Boys. Brandt wondered if these guys would still be calling them boys when they were in their sixties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation, if you don\u2019t mind. Me\u2019n Tell and Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinkin\u2019 of makin\u2019 some changes already?\u201d Carson asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see, but it\u2019ll nice to be involved in the decision makin\u2019 process for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>Brandt slipped his arm around Jessie\u2019s waist and pulled her close. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one.\u201d Carson looked between Brandt and Jessie. \u201cWe\u2019re all happy for you two.\u201d</p><p>He waited for Carson to add something, like Luke would be happy for them, too, or advise them to start having McKay babies, but he turned away and spoke to Cal as they put on their winter wear.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear what Liesl did the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Eliza told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she in on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I swear them two girls are gonna be more trouble than all their male cousins combined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably more than their uncles and fathers combined,\u201d Charlie offered.</p><p>All three men groaned on their way out the door.</p><p>Brandt tugged Jessie on his lap and just held her, trying to process everything. And she rested her head into that spot on his body that\u2019d been made for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow it\u2019s sad your uncles\u2019 wives are finally offering Joan support now, when she doesn\u2019t need it. She needed it years ago.\u201d</p><p>Brandt kissed her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to stand up for her, Jess, but my mom should\u2019ve asked for support years ago. Plus, it just goes to show you that it\u2019s never too late to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Do you think Joan just needs time away? That she and Casper will get back together down the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I plan on keeping my nose out of their marriage and I hope they extend us the same courtesy.\u201d</p><p>Jessie wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cSpeaking of marriage...when are we making it official?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithin the week, Jess. I\u2019m not givin\u2019 you time to change your mind. So pick a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more serious in my life. Let\u2019s do it as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about\u2014\u201d</p><p>Brandt smothered her protest with a kiss. A kiss that heated rapidly, as kisses between them were prone to do. He kept kissing her, pouring everything of himself, everything he was feeling into her. He rested his forehead to hers. \u201cI want to spend my life with you, Jessie. Every day. With you as my wife. I don\u2019t want to wait because my feelings ain\u2019t ever gonna change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same.\u201d Jessie laughed. \u201cOkay. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about Friday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Wait. It\u2019s not Friday the thirteenth, is it?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cKnowing our luck, it probably is. But I can\u2019t help but think our luck is about to change.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
