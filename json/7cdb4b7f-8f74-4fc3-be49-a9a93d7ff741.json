It was introduced in Debbie Macomber\u2019s MIDNIGHT SONS series (Brides for Brothers, The Marriage Risk, Daddy\u2019s Little Helper, Because of the Baby, Falling for Him and Ending in Marriage\u2014first published in 1995 and 1996 and reprinted in three volumes in 2000).</p> <p>The town was founded in 1931 by Adam O\u2019Halloran and his wife, Anna. By the time of the Second World War, its population was fifty or sixty people, all told. During the war, the O\u2019Halloran sons, Charles and David, joined the armed services. Charles was killed; only David came home\u2014with a young English war bride, Ellen Sawyer.</p><p>After the war, David qualified as a bush pilot. He then built some small cabins to attract the sport fishermen and hunters who were starting to come to Alaska. Eventually, he built a lodge to replace the cabins\u2014a lodge that later burned.</p><p>David and Ellen had three sons born fairly late in their marriage\u2014Charles (named after David\u2019s brother), Sawyer and Christian.</p><p>Hard Luck had been growing all this time, and by 1970 was home to just over a hundred people. These were the years of the oil boom, when the school and community center were built by the state. After Vietnam, ex-serviceman Ben Hamilton came to live here and opened the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9, which became the social focus for the town.</p><p>In the 1980s, the three O\u2019Halloran brothers formed a partnership, creating MIDNIGHT SONS, a bush pilot service. When the original series started, the O\u2019Hallorans were losing qualified pilots at an alarming rate\u2014because there were no women in town! So, the brothers came up with a plan: Offer jobs and land to women willing to move to Alaska...</p> <p>\u201cMidnight Sons and Daughters\u201d takes place almost twenty years later. Scott O\u2019Halloran, stepson of Sawyer, and Chrissie Harris, daughter of Mitch, are keeping the great tradition of Alaskan romance alive!</p><p>BORN IN A SMALL TOWN</p><p>Midnight Sons and Daughters</p><p>Cast of Major Characters (introduced in the MIDNIGHT SONS series).

And she might have the opportunity today, she thought, reluctant to get out of bed on this clear August morning. The man had broken her heart, not once but twice\u2014and she\u2019d let him!</p><p>The first time she\u2019d been seventeen, and she\u2019d stood at the Midnight Sons airstrip one frigid winter morning and watched him fly out of Hard Luck, Alaska. Unable to get along with his mother and stepfather, Scott had enlisted in the army. Chrissie had thought her whole world would cave in without Scott. She\u2019d been crazy about him from the time she was in grade school, when his mother had moved him to Hard Luck with him and his sister and married Sawyer O\u2019Halloran. In third grade Chrissie had decided that as soon as they were grown-ups, she\u2019d marry Scott; she\u2019d believed he loved her, too\u2014a belief she\u2019d maintained for the next decade.</p> <p>She\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Two years out of high school he\u2019d clashed with his stepfather and promptly volunteered three years of his life to Uncle Sam. Chrissie had moped around for weeks, missing him dreadfully but pretending otherwise. In retrospect she realized she hadn\u2019t fooled anyone. Least of all Susan, her best friend and Scott\u2019s sister.</p><p>Every afternoon Chrissie had beaten a path to the post office, eager for a letter. Every night she\u2019d poured out her heart to him in long missives. In the beginning Scott did write. Boot camp was hell, he\u2019d told her. Following graduation he volunteered for Airborne Ranger School in Fort Benning, Georgia. Eventually his letters became less and less frequent. Finally they stopped altogether.</p><p>What hurt most was that Scott had asked his sister to break the news. As gently as possible, Susan let Chrissie know that Scott had met someone else.</p><p>That was the first time he\u2019d broken her heart.</p><p>The next time happened five years later, the year Chrissie and Susan graduated from college. The two families had thrown a huge celebration party in Hard Luck, which half the town attended. Who should unexpectedly show up but Scott O\u2019Halloran? He\u2019d occasionally come home during the intervening years, but Chrissie had always avoided him. After the heartless way he\u2019d dumped her, it was what he deserved. But at twenty-two she was older, more mature. Smart, too. She hadn\u2019t graduated magna cum laude for nothing.</p><p>Only, Chrissie wasn\u2019t nearly as savvy as she\u2019d assumed. It took Scott less than a week to maneuver himself back into her life. He told her how much he\u2019d missed her, how he regretted the way he\u2019d treated her. He\u2019d gone on to claim that every woman he\u2019d met since paled compared to her. Blah, blah, blah.</p><p>Chrissie had swallowed his lies, every one of them. She was so in love with him her brain had virtually ceased to function. Then Farrah Warner had arrived and declared herself Scott\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Scott had tried to explain, to apologize, but Chrissie had refused to listen. Before another day had passed, Scott and Farrah had flown out of Hard Luck, leaving everyone, including his own family, upset and confused.</p><p>Chrissie vowed that was the second and last time he\u2019d ever break her heart.</p><p>Recently she\u2019d heard that Scott was returning to Hard Luck permanently as a partner in Midnight Sons, the bush plane service owned by his father and his uncle Christian. Chrissie swore she wouldn\u2019t allow Scott O\u2019Halloran to come anywhere near her. She would not give him the opportunity to break her heart a third time.</p><p>That determined, she rolled over and turned off her clock radio before the alarm could buzz. Sitting up, she rubbed the sleep\u2014what little she\u2019d managed to catch\u2014from her eyes. She\u2019d spent most of the night reviewing her history with Scott, going over and over his betrayals, hardening her resolve. At twenty-six, she wasn\u2019t a schoolgirl any longer. The law degree hanging in the office she shared with Tracy Santiago Porter said as much.</p><p>When the phone pealed at five minutes after seven, it jolted Chrissie so badly she nearly fell off the bed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s flight is due in at ten,\u201d Susan cheerfully informed her. Despite everything, her best friend continued to believe that Scott and Chrissie were meant to be together. As far as Chrissie was concerned, it wouldn\u2019t happen in this or any other lifetime.</p><p>\u201cOh, Scott\u2019s coming home?\u201d Chrissie asked, hoping she sounded bored and uninterested. \u201cIs that today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Chrissie said, faking a yawn. \u201cI suppose I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time it\u2019s for good. My brother\u2019s here to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Chrissie feigned a second yawn as if she couldn\u2019t care less. She cared, all right, but only because she wanted to tell him he was lower than a tundra rat\u2014and then follow that with a resounding slap to his face.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad are thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie tensed, struggling to hide her reaction.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be flying for Midnight Sons. Mom and Dad have been wanting this for years. With Anna and Ryan older now, Dad\u2019s hoping to cut back his hours and... Oh, Chrissie, this is what we\u2019ve all wanted!\u201d</p><p>Chrissie knew that, but she wasn\u2019t sure Hard Luck was big enough for the both of them. All right, fine, she could deal with Scott living in Hard Luck. It wasn\u2019t as though her world revolved around him. Not anymore. Whether he stayed or moved on didn\u2019t make one iota of difference to her.</p><p>She could certainly be civil if she ran into him, although that wasn\u2019t likely to happen often. Hard Luck wasn\u2019t as small a town as it had once been. Twenty years ago the population was around fifty\u2014mostly cantankerous men in need of women. The O\u2019Halloran brothers hadn\u2019t been able to hold on to their staff of professional pilots and were losing them at an alarming rate to other commuter-airline companies in Fairbanks and Anchorage. Something had to be done, and quickly. The best way to keep their pilots, the O\u2019Halloran brothers had decided, was to lure women north.</p><p>Their plan worked, too. Surprisingly well. Abbey, Scott and Susan\u2019s mother, was the first woman to arrive, and a number of others had followed soon after. In the years since, Hard Luck had expanded, and its population had reached a robust six hundred. More families moved in every year.</p><p>Susan\u2019s husband, Ron Gold, and his partner, Matt Caldwell, did a booming winter tourist business, which involved dogsledding, camping and more. Midnight Sons flew in the adventure-seeking sight-seers. That was only part of their business; they also functioned as a commuter line and a courier company. Actually the airline had a corner on the market, because the only way to reach Hard Luck was by plane.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be long now before the next group of visitors showed up. The last days of summer lingered on, but in early September the weather would start to turn chilly; snow would come by October\u2014and with it, the winter tourists.</p><p>\u201cChrissie, Chrissie. Have you heard anything I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Chrissie muttered. \u201cI let my thoughts wander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be pleased Scott\u2019s moving home,\u201d Susan insisted. \u201cYou two make such a perfect couple.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie snickered. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She and Scott? Not anymore. She didn\u2019t trust him, couldn\u2019t make her heart vulnerable to him a third time. The first two times had hurt too damn much. No, she was a sensible attorney now, a woman who wouldn\u2019t be swayed by a glib tongue and a pair of bright baby blues, even if they did belong to the one and only man she\u2019d ever truly loved.</p><p>\u201cScott could move next door and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference to me,\u201d Chrissie said in as matter-of-fact a tone as she could muster.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d Leave it to Susan and her romantic inclinations. But then, Chrissie supposed Susan was entitled to feel optimistic on that score; the year she graduated from college, she\u2019d married the boy she\u2019d loved half her life. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve still got to shower,\u201d Chrissie said. Knowing Susan wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until she had her way, she added, \u201cWhen you see Scott, tell him hello for me.\u201d As soon as the words left her lips, she realized her mistake. Scott might consider that an invitation to look her up, and there was nothing she wanted less. Quickly she said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t. In fact, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t mention my name at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know Scott\u2019s going to ask about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if he does, tell him I\u2019m perfectly content without him in my life.\u201d</p><p>Susan laughed outright. \u201cThat sounds like a crock to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t,\u201d Chrissie said, praying she wasn\u2019t giving herself away. Hiding her true feelings from her best friend was something she found difficult. But the truth was, she fully intended to keep her distance from Scott.</p> <p>Resolved to push all thoughts of him from her mind, Chrissie slammed into the office early. She refused to look at her clock, refused to remember that at ten that very morning, Scott O\u2019Halloran was flying back into Hard Luck\u2014and into her well-ordered life.</p><p>At eleven-thirty, just as she was about to break for lunch, Kate, the secretary she shared with Tracy, buzzed her. \u201cScott O\u2019Halloran is here to see you. Shall I send him in?\u201d</p><p>Already? Chrissie\u2019s heart began to race, pounding so hard she had to catch her breath. Scott was here? Now?</p><p>\u201cMs. Harris?\u201d</p><p>Forcing her heart to slow down, Chrissie leaned over and pressed the intercom button. \u201cSend him in,\u201d she said as evenly as her shallow breath would allow.</p> <p>A moment later Scott strolled into her small office. He hadn\u2019t changed. He was still better-looking than any man had a right to be. He\u2019d always had a real presence\u2014a confident quality and a sense of life that invariably attracted people. Especially women. Chrissie made herself stand and meet him eye to eye. For one wild moment all she could do was stare. Furious at her reaction, she let her hands fall onto her desk for support.</p><p>\u201cHello, Scott,\u201d she managed to say, proud of revealing a complete lack of emotion. To all appearances, he might have been a stranger.</p><p>\u201cChrissie.\u201d He beamed her a smile bright enough to rival the sun.</p><p>She inhaled and held her breath. With hardly any effort, he was tearing down her defenses. And, no doubt, he knew exactly the effect he had on her, hide it though she might.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking good,\u201d he murmured with a nod of approval.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said in blithe tones, wanting him to realize she wouldn\u2019t be won over by a bit of flattery and some practiced charm. Not this time. He could fall at her feet and beg her forgiveness, and she\u2019d look down at him and feel nothing but contempt.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a few minutes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cActually I don\u2019t.\u201d Striking a casual pose, she crossed her arms. How dared he assume he could saunter into her office and pretend nothing had happened? He had nerve, she\u2019d say that for him. Well, dammit, so did she. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019d be best if we cleared the air now,\u201d she said aggressively.</p><p>\u201cCleared the air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think you can walk back into my life again, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m older now. Wiser, too. The first time, shame on you, the second time shame on me. There simply isn\u2019t gong to be a third time.\u201d</p><p>Scott\u2019s lips quivered with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou find this amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d give me a chance to explain...\u201d he began.</p><p>She laughed lightly, breezily, as if to suggest she\u2019d be a fool to listen to anything he had to say. \u201cExplain what? You\u2019re the one who claimed to be in love with me\u2014and all the while you were engaged to another woman! Frankly, I\u2019m not interested in hearing any explanations. That\u2019s all water under the bridge.\u201d With great aplomb, she walked around her desk to her chair. Sitting down, her back very straight, she reached for her pen and glanced casually upward. \u201cI think you should leave now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, the truth is, Chrissie, I didn\u2019t stop by to rehash old times. I was planning to hire you to draw up some legal papers, since I\u2019m becoming a full partner in Midnight Sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mortified beyond words, Chrissie fought to keep from crawling beneath her desk.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll make an appointment with Tracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d she blubbered, then nodded, implying she thought this was probably the best idea.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d he said on his way out the door, closing it behind him.</p><p>Chrissie dropped her forehead to her desk. What was it about Scott O\u2019Halloran that turned her into a complete idiot every time she saw him?</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>ABBEY O\u2019HALLORAN\u2019S HEART was full. As she shelved books at the Hard Luck lending library, she reflected on the reason for her happiness. She\u2019d been waiting for this day a very long time. Her son was home. Years ago, divorced and raising two children alone, she\u2019d moved to Hard Luck and, after a few weeks and a whirlwind courtship, had married Sawyer O\u2019Halloran. They had a good marriage and had added Anna and Ryan, now seventeen and nineteen respectively, to their family. As soon as he could, Sawyer had adopted Scott and Susan, and loved and nurtured her children as his own. Scott, however, had gone through a difficult period of teenage rebellion that had left Abbey and Sawyer at a loss as to how to deal with him.</p><p>It\u2019d all started his last year of high school, when he had a couple of minor run-ins with Mitch Harris, the sheriff and Chrissie\u2019s father. Mitch assured Sawyer and Abbey that Scott wasn\u2019t a bad boy and the pranks he\u2019d pulled were typical of many teenagers. Skipping school and painting graffiti on the community-center wall were small infractions, ones Abbey had been willing to overlook. What she couldn\u2019t excuse was Scott\u2019s lack of respect for Sawyer. Her husband had been nothing but warm and loving to both Scott and Susan. Scott, though, had become an increasingly angry young man, and he\u2019d vented that anger against Sawyer. Abbey had never completely understood why her son seemed so resentful, why he\u2019d felt such rage. His unpleasant behavior had escalated during his high-school years and later, too, when Scott had briefly worked for Midnight Sons. Although Sawyer had never complained, Abbey knew he\u2019d been deeply hurt by the things Scott had said and done.</p><p>Then one day, without a word to anyone, Scott had enlisted in the army. Not that Abbey or Sawyer would have objected. By this point it was obvious that Scott had problems he needed to resolve. As his mother, she\u2019d longed to help him deal with his past, yearned to answer his doubts, but she couldn\u2019t help what she didn\u2019t understand. Watching Scott fly out of Hard Luck for boot camp was, without question, one of the most difficult moments she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>She\u2019d known someday he\u2019d return. She just hadn\u2019t known when that day would come. She certainly hadn\u2019t expected it to be nearly ten years later.</p><p>The library door opened and Sawyer walked in. Even after all these years of marriage, she felt a rush of joy at the sight of him. His hair was almost completely gray now. The laugh lines around his eyes were more pronounced but he was as handsome and vital as when they\u2019d first met.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, surprised to see him.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve got a library card.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held a warm teasing light and she smiled in response. She\u2019d loved this man for twenty years and borne him two children. They\u2019d made a good life together in Hard Luck and looked forward to the time they could officially retire and travel, the way they\u2019d planned. As Sawyer often reminded her, there was an entire world for them to explore. But no matter where they went, Alaska would always be home.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were with Scott.\u201d She placed the latest Janet Evanovich mystery back on the shelf, then turned and kissed her husband, catching him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so happy I can barely hold it all inside. Scott\u2019s home! And this time it\u2019s for good.\u201d</p><p>Sawyer grinned with equal delight. \u201cHe\u2019s grown up, Abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe years away have served him well. He\u2019s lost all that anger. He\u2019s made peace with himself and he\u2019s ready to step into the business.\u201d Sawyer moved toward her desk and perched on the corner. \u201cDid you hear he\u2019s found a place to rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d Abbey couldn\u2019t help being disappointed. She\u2019d hoped for a chance to fuss over her son for the first couple of weeks.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to make his own way, and I can\u2019t say I blame him,\u201d Sawyer said in Scott\u2019s defense. \u201cMatt and Karen are renting him one of the cabins they renovated this summer.\u201d Their good friends, the Caldwells, had owned and operated Hard Luck Lodge for the past twenty years and had always been fond of Scott. Their primary business was providing accommodations for the tourists who flew in with Arctic Experiences, the tour company run by Matt and their son-in-law, Ron Gold.</p><p>Now that Abbey thought about it, one of those cabins was ideal. There was also a touch of irony attached to it. She\u2019d come here in response to an advertisement offering jobs to women willing to move to Hard Luck, fifty miles from the Arctic Circle. To attract qualified job applicants, Midnight Sons had included a cabin and twenty acres of land for each. What the brothers hadn\u2019t bothered to disclose was that the cabins were dilapidated one-room shacks, desperately in need of repair. If that wasn\u2019t insult enough, the twenty acres they\u2019d so generously thrown in were nowhere near Hard Luck or the cabins. For the most part they were only accessible by air.</p><p>\u201cMatt\u2019s done a good job with those cabins,\u201d Sawyer remarked.</p><p>Abbey agreed. The original shacks had been torn down years ago and larger, better-equipped cabins built. The Caldwells had recently begun an extensive process of renovation and Scott would be renting one of the newly upgraded cabins.</p><p>\u201cScott\u2019s had a busy afternoon,\u201d Sawyer continued. \u201cHe was in to see Tracy about having the papers drawn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Chrissie?\u201d Abbey asked.</p><p>Sawyer shook his head. \u201cApparently not. My guess is, he knows he\u2019s got some amends to make.\u201d</p><p>Abbey nodded slowly. As Scott\u2019s mother she could think of no better wife for her son than Chrissie Harris. Although Scott had never discussed his feelings for Chrissie, Abbey knew he\u2019d loved her as a teenager, and Abbey strongly suspected he loved her still.</p><p>That morning when he\u2019d arrived, Abbey noticed the way Scott\u2019s gaze had moved over the crowd who\u2019d gathered to greet him. He\u2019d been searching for Chrissie; she was sure of it. And practically the first stop he\u2019d made in town was the attorneys\u2019 office. Yes, there were some legal papers to be drawn up, but that certainly didn\u2019t need to be done the first day he was back.</p><p>\u201cAbbey?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to find her husband watching her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look in your eye.\u201d</p><p>Abbey played dumb. \u201cWhat look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that tells me you\u2019re up to no good.\u201d</p><p>She frowned with indignation. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a clue what I\u2019m thinking, Sawyer O\u2019Halloran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d her husband challenged, leaving her desk to sink into an overstuffed chair. Abbey sat on the chair arm beside him. \u201cI do know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he told her. \u201cYour eyes give you away. You\u2019re thinking about Scott and Chrissie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abbey considered arguing with him, but he was right and he knew it. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember how badly Scott wanted us to get married?\u201d she asked, the years rolling away with the memory. Sawyer had originally proposed for what Abbey believed to be all the wrong reasons. It\u2019d nearly broken her heart to turn him down, but with one failed marriage behind her, she couldn\u2019t afford to make a second mistake. She\u2019d already fallen in love with him, but his proposal had been motivated more by his fear that someone else might ask her first. Or so it had seemed to her. Loving him the way she did, afraid he didn\u2019t really love her, she\u2019d believed that the only sensible option was to protect her family\u2014and her vulnerable emotions. She\u2019d decided to leave Hard Luck. Then Scott and Susan had disappeared. Abbey had never known such panic as she\u2019d felt that night.</p><p>Her husband reached for her hand, gently squeezing her fingers. \u201cIf not for Scott and Susan running away, I might have lost you. I was crazy about you then and I\u2019m even crazier about you now.\u201d</p><p>Abbey pressed her head to his shoulder, savoring the feel of his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cOnly, back then I didn\u2019t know how to tell you,\u201d Sawyer said, the frustration and anguish of that night evident even after all these years. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to persuade you to stay.\u201d</p> <p>Abbey kept her head against her husband\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow Scott needs our help,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWith Chrissie?\u201d</p><p>Abbey nodded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s more like you than you realize. He loves Chrissie, but he\u2019s not sure how to proceed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting I give him advice?\u201d Sawyer asked, looking aghast at the prospect.</p><p>Abbey giggled. \u201cHardly. The situation calls for diplomacy.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband\u2019s frown cut deep grooves in his forehead. \u201cLike what?\u201d he asked warily. \u201cAnd please note that I\u2019m ignoring the slur on my diplomatic abilities.\u201d</p><p>Abbey smiled. \u201cI think we should hold a welcome-home party for him. We have a lot to celebrate, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do indeed.\u201d Sawyer\u2019s face relaxed. \u201cAnd there\u2019s someone you\u2019re going to invite, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Abbey brought her index finger to her lips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be obvious about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Sawyer said, sounding amused. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to be obvious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make it a surprise party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise party?\u201d Sawyer echoed. \u201cBut who do you intend to surprise? Scott or Chrissie?\u201d</p><p>IT WAS ALMOST FOUR-THIRTY when Scott walked into the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9\u2014too early for the dinner crowd. The restaurant hadn\u2019t changed much over the years, and neither had Ben. To Scott\u2019s eyes, Ben Hamilton had aged barely a year in the past ten. He was in his sixties now, his hair a little thinner on top but his welcoming smile as warm and wide as always.</p><p>\u201cScott!\u201d Ben greeted him with unconcealed delight. \u201cHey, boy, you\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged hearty handshakes and then impulsively hugged.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re moving back to Hard Luck?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Scott confirmed, and slid onto a stool at the counter. He picked up a menu, although he wasn\u2019t planning to order a meal. The menu was a lot more professional-looking than it used to be with its smudged type and cracked plastic coating. But fancy menus or not, the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9 had been his favorite restaurant for years, and in his time away he hadn\u2019t found any better.</p><p>\u201cWe got salmon on special. Mary poaches it in a lemon sauce that\u2019s out of this world.\u201d Ben extravagantly kissed his fingertips as he spoke.</p> <p>In the old days, Ben had served everything loaded down with fat and extra calories. No more; his wife, Mary, had seen to that. Healthy food choices had started appearing on the menu when Ben married her, although the changes had been fairly subtle.</p><p>\u201cSalmon sounds good, but Mom\u2019s cooking me a feast. I\u2019d better not disappoint her.\u201d He closed the menu and tucked it behind the sugar canister. Ben automatically poured him a mug of coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear you\u2019re going to be flying with your dad and Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d His hands cupped the mug. Scott had earned his pilot\u2019s license when he was sixteen. Whereas most teens hungered for their driver\u2019s license, Scott had been far more interested in learning to fly. After his stint in the army, he\u2019d worked for a flight service out of Utah, flying tourists over the Canyonlands. He\u2019d been content during those years, enjoying his freedom and earning decent money. He\u2019d had friends, lots of them, and a number of women he saw on a regular basis\u2014but these relationships were all casual, without depth or commitment. He\u2019d also been engaged once, but that had turned into a spectacular mess, and he hadn\u2019t repeated the experience. Then, a month ago, he\u2019d suddenly realized he\u2019d been running away from what he wanted most, and that was his home and his family. He missed Alaska, regretted the anger of his youth and the pain he\u2019d brought his parents. It was time to make amends. In fact, it was long past time.</p><p>And then there was Chrissie.</p><p>He smiled just thinking about their encounter that morning. When he announced that he\u2019d merely come for legal advice, she\u2019d looked like she wanted to crawl into a hole and die. He\u2019d managed not to laugh then but he couldn\u2019t restrain his amusement now. He chuckled, replaying the scene in his mind.</p><p>\u201cDid I miss something funny?\u201d Ben asked, sidling up to the counter and leaning against it just as he had for more years than Scott could remember.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Scott told him, suppressing his mirth. \u201cJust something that happened this morning, soon after I got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Scott had stopped by Chrissie\u2019s office on business, but he was willing to admit there was more to it than that. He\u2019d wanted to see her and, in fact, had been anticipating their meeting for weeks.</p><p>Chrissie was one of the reasons he\u2019d stayed away from Hard Luck and one of the reasons he\u2019d come home.</p><p>\u201cSeems just like the old days seeing you again,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cThe old days,\u201d Scott repeated. Back then, the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9 had been the gathering place for the entire community. Men, in particular, used to meet at Ben\u2019s the way some might socialize in a tavern. Not only that, many people in the community, if not most, had come to Ben at one time or another to talk through their troubles. Scott suspected they continued to do so.</p><p>\u201cDo you still have that Frequent Eater program?\u201d Scott asked.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Ben answered with a grin. \u201cDon\u2019t need it. These days I got more business than I know what to do with.\u201d</p><p>Scott nodded; he wasn\u2019t surprised that Ben\u2019s remained popular. He knew that over the years a couple of other restaurants had opened, but the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9 was\u2014and deserved to be\u2014everyone\u2019s favorite. Ben was officially retired; however, he couldn\u2019t quite keep his hands out of the business.</p><p>\u201cI remember you as a youngster, sitting on one of those stools,\u201d Ben said with genuine fondness.</p><p>\u201cOnly seems right to see you here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt used to be I could talk to you about anything,\u201d Scott recalled.</p><p>\u201cStill can, if you\u2019ve got a hankering,\u201d Ben assured him.</p><p>Scott was tempted. Many a time he\u2019d talked out his problems with Ben Hamilton. Many a time he\u2019d felt as if the world was against him. Few people knew it, but Ben was the one who\u2019d suggested Scott consider enlisting in the military. A former navy man, he\u2019d been disappointed when Scott chose the army. But not as disappointed as Sawyer that he hadn\u2019t decided on the air force.</p><p>Back then, Scott had been downright contrary. Angry, too, only he didn\u2019t know why or at what. Eventually he\u2019d recognized that it wasn\u2019t Sawyer he hated or even his biological father, a man who\u2019d rejected his own wife and children. He knew now that he\u2019d been old enough at the time of his parents\u2019 separation to be aware of his father\u2019s rejection and to be seriously hurt by it, to wonder if he was somehow to blame. The teen years had become increasingly difficult, and then Eagle Catcher, his husky, had died. The grief he\u2019d felt over the loss of his dog\u2014a grief he couldn\u2019t share\u2014had turned to anger. Hardly understanding himself, he\u2019d lashed out at those he loved most. The things he\u2019d said and done deeply embarrassed him now.</p><p>\u201cAnything you want to discuss?\u201d Ben asked, sounding eager. \u201cIt stays right here. Nothing you tell me goes any further.\u201d</p><p>Scott hesitated, then decided to ask about Chrissie. Really, there wasn\u2019t anyone else he could ask. Not Susan, who was guaranteed to run to her friend and repeat every word. Not the other pilots, either, or his uncles or aunts. No one in his extended family, that was for sure.</p><p>\u201cIs Chrissie seeing anyone special?\u201d he blurted out before he could stop to ponder the wisdom of showing his hand like this.</p><p>\u201cChrissie Harris?\u201d Ben asked as if there were two Chrissies in Hard Luck. He averted his gaze. \u201cAs a matter of fact, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d So Chrissie was involved. It made sense that she would be; he knew she hadn\u2019t married. Ridiculous though it was, considering their history, he\u2019d hoped she\u2019d be as interested in renewing their relationship as he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him, mind you,\u201d Ben continued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Fairbanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hear anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d Ben was less forthcoming than usual.</p><p>Scott waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. I\u2019m probably speaking out of turn by telling you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know,\u201d Scott insisted. \u201cI need to know,\u201d he thought to himself.</p><p>\u201cShe visits Joel every second weekend. That\u2019s all I know\u2014Joel, Fairbanks, twice a month. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Joel have a last name?\u201d Not that it mattered, but Scott was curious.</p><p>\u201cMust have, but no one\u2019s ever told me.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019d been a Joel Higgins a year behind him in school\u2014a good athlete, well liked and well adjusted. Needless to say, Scott hadn\u2019t cared for him and dismissed him as a male Goody Two-shoes.</p><p>\u201cEvery other Saturday morning Chrissie flies into Fairbanks and doesn\u2019t return until Sunday afternoon. Generally she comes in here for a bite to eat before heading home. Once in a while she mentions Joel, but she\u2019s pretty closemouthed about him. Let me add one thing, though,\u201d he said, and paused, frowning heavily. \u201cBy the time she steps off that plane, she\u2019s really dragging.\u201d</p><p>Scott didn\u2019t need Ben to say another word; he got the picture. Chrissie spent weekends with Joel and arrived in Hard Luck exhausted. He didn\u2019t need to guess the reason, either. No wonder his sister hadn\u2019t mentioned Chrissie\u2019s involvement with someone else.</p><p>Sure as anything she knew, but she hadn\u2019t so much as dropped a hint\u2014because his finding out would ruin everything. Susan, the hopeless romantic, refused to let go of the idea that Scott and Chrissie belonged together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAsk her,\u201d Ben advised.</p><p>\u201cAsk Chrissie? You have to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Ben demanded. \u201cNothing works better than the direct approach. According to Mary, that\u2019s what women want these days. None of this second-guessing stuff. That went out with the seventies. If nothing else, Chrissie will respect you for being forthright enough to ask.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s idea was worthy of consideration. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Scott finished his coffee, but when he went to pay for it, Ben told him it was on the house. His old friend\u2019s generosity hadn\u2019t changed. In addition to a good cup of coffee, he\u2019d given Scott something to think about.</p><p>The next few days passed quickly. Thursday afternoon Scott had an appointment at the law office. He was in the waiting room when Chrissie walked into the reception area. She halted midstep the instant she saw him.</p><p>\u201cHello, Scott,\u201d she said, her voice remarkably cool and even.</p><p>\u201cChrissie.\u201d He nodded. Then, feeling the need to explain the purpose of his visit, he added, \u201cI have an appointment with Tracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She held a folder pressed flat against her stomach and wore a slightly puzzled expression, as if she\u2019d forgotten why she\u2019d come out of her office. \u201cI, uh, gather everything\u2019s going very well for you at Midnight Sons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s pleased to have you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d he asked, wondering if she included herself.</p><p>\u201cYour family, certainly.\u201d This came after a slight hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI had coffee at Ben\u2019s the other day,\u201d he said casually, hoping to ease into a more comfortable conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. I swear he hasn\u2019t changed at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wonderful. So is Mary.\u201d</p> <p>A short silence followed, which Chrissie broke. \u201cI understand Matt and Karen rented you one of the renovated cabins.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d been checking up on him. That was encouraging. Maybe, just maybe, she still cared. That thought gave him the courage to ask her out. \u201cI was thinking you and I might have a drink one afternoon,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Her eyes widened and her arms tightened around the folder.</p><p>\u201cA drink,\u201d she repeated slowly. \u201cAt Ben\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOr dinner, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders and chewed her lower lip before answering. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, as if her refusal was of little consequence to him. \u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I had a few things I wanted to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s expressive eyes had always told him what she was thinking before she uttered a word. He\u2019d wondered if this would be a detriment to her as an attorney, but apparently that wasn\u2019t the case.</p> <p>\u201cYou had something you wanted to talk to me about?\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She worried her lower lip further. \u201cMaybe...\u201d She hesitated, then seemed to regain her resolve. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Scott. Thanks, anyway.\u201d She turned away to enter her office.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you intend to avoid me?\u201d he called after her.</p><p>At his question, she turned back. \u201cAvoid you? Don\u2019t flatter yourself. What I intend to do is live my life just the way I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously have every intention of avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have every intention of not seeking you out. That\u2019s not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently you don\u2019t,\u201d she returned in her best lawyer voice. \u201cYou\u2019re out of my life, Scott. That was your choice, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change, Chrissie. They\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d she interrupted, waving her finger at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do this to me. Not again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you out for a drink. I wasn\u2019t proposing we move in together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure, a drink\u2014for old times\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected. \u201cA drink to clear the air. I deserve that much, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared with outrage. \u201cWhat you deserve, Scott O\u2019Halloran, is a slap across the face.\u201d She raised her chin so high she threatened to put her neck out of joint. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cFine. As a matter of fairness I\u2019ll have a drink with you.\u201d</p><p>Scott experienced a surge of hope. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriday night at the party.\u201d</p><p>Scott frowned. \u201cWhat party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party your parents are\u2014\u201d She bit off the rest of the sentence.</p><p>\u201cChrissie?\u201d</p><p>Squeezing her eyes shut, she slowly exhaled. \u201cOh, damn, it\u2019s supposed to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>THURSDAY MORNING Karen Caldwell poured her husband a second cup of coffee, then joined him in the massive kitchen at Hard Luck Lodge. Working as a team, they\u2019d built the lodge into one of the most popular tourist destinations in the state. It\u2019d taken almost twenty years of blood, sweat and tears, but they were equal partners, not only in their business, but in life.</p><p>During those years they\u2019d also had three children and managed to create a warm nurturing home for their family.</p><p>Clay, their eldest, had been the best surprise of their lives, conceived while they were divorced and living apart. The pregnancy was what had brought them back to their senses. Clay was at UCLA now, studying chemistry. The girls, Jill and Emily, were sixteen and fourteen respectively and attended the local high school.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking thoughtful,\u201d Matt said when Karen sat down across from him at the table. In a flurry of activity and near-panic, the girls had flown out the door for classes. After the long summer break they were having trouble resuming the discipline of waking up early for school. Only a few moments ago, Jill had been searching for her misplaced gym uniform. While her sister dashed frantically about, Emily had slapped together lunch for both of them. Now, with the girls gone, blessed silence enveloped the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worrying about Clay again, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Matt\u2019s tone held a slight accusation.</p><p>Karen hadn\u2019t found it easy sending their son off to college a few weeks earlier, especially a college so far from home. Still, she knew that Clay was a lot like her\u2014steady and capable. Jill and Emily were more like Matt\u2014creative but a bit unfocused. The focus part would come in time, the way it had with their father, Karen believed.</p><p>\u201cActually I was thinking about Scott O\u2019Halloran,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see him again, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Karen knew Matt was pleased to rent out one of the cabins on a long-term basis, especially to Scott, whom they both liked. \u201cHe\u2019s still hung up on Chrissie, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Karen asked, knowing her husband had talked to Scott a number of times.</p><p>Matt shrugged, and Karen rolled her eyes. In her opinion, most men were hopeless when it came to romance; Matt was no exception. And Scott\u2014well, as a kid he\u2019d had delusions of romantic expertise.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what Scott told us just before Clay was born?\u201d she asked her husband.</p><p>Matt chuckled. \u201cSweetheart, that was a lot of years ago.\u201d</p><p>Karen\u2019s memory was good, and this particular incident had stayed with her. She smiled, recalling the day the young boy had stood resolutely before her. \u201cHe claimed that he was responsible for bringing the two of us back together. In fact, he felt we owed our reconciliation to him.\u201d</p><p>Matt burst out laughing. \u201cScott\u2019s the one who said I should take you camping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to wine and dine me, right?\u201d Karen muttered. Scott\u2019s idea of creating a romantic mood was that Matt should drag her and all the necessary and assorted gear to his favorite fishing place. Apparently Scott believed that sleeping on the ground, battling off mosquito attacks, plus catching, cleaning and cooking all their meals would rekindle their love. All this when Karen was several months pregnant with Clay. What a disaster that had been.</p><p>For one thing, fishing had never been her forte, and Matt had been furious when she\u2019d nearly lost his favorite rod and pole. Then she\u2019d fallen in the river and gotten drenched from head to toe. Matt had managed to catch fish after fish, and all she\u2019d caught was a miserable cold, as if pregnancy hadn\u2019t made her uncomfortable enough. By the time she returned to Hard Luck, it was a miracle they were even speaking to each other.</p><p>\u201cScott used to see himself as quite the matchmaker, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged smiles across the table, smiles that quickly turned into laughter as the memories continued to surface.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d Karen said, reaching for her coffee. She held the mug in front of her lips as she mulled over her idea. \u201cTurnabout is fair play.\u201d</p><p>Matt stared at her. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that.... Anyway, this is none of our business. They\u2014\u201d</p><p>Karen went on as though he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cWe could arrange for Scott to take Chrissie somewhere he once considered wildly romantic...like, I don\u2019t know, the garbage dump? I remember you once suggested we go out there and watch the bears.\u201d</p><p>Matt chuckled. \u201cScott will think that\u2019s fun, but I\u2019m not so sure about Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Karen agreed, still thinking. \u201cHmm. All we need to do is figure how to get the two of them alone. Given a little time, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d work everything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the garbage dump?\u201d</p><p>Karen rolled her eyes again. \u201cSomeplace else. You come up with a spot. You\u2019re the creative one in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, be sensible. First of all, you don\u2019t have any real evidence that Chrissie still feels the same way about Scott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d Karen said. \u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so they went together for a while, but that was ages ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie\u2019s loved Scott from the time she was eight.\u201d</p><p>Matt seemed to require a moment to think that through. \u201cAll right, Chrissie loves Scott. But how will Mitch feel about all this? I didn\u2019t get the impression he\u2019s too thrilled to have Scott back in town.\u201d</p><p>Her husband had a point. Mitch Harris was Chrissie\u2019s father and represented the law in Hard Luck. Scott wasn\u2019t really a bad kid, but Mitch and Scott had clashed a number of times. Not that Scott\u2019s misdemeanors were anything new in Hard Luck; other teens were guilty of similar behavior. The difference was Chrissie\u2019s involvement with him. Father and daughter had argued over Scott more than once. Mitch had refused to make allowances for his daughter\u2019s boyfriend, regardless of her desperate pleas. Karen knew the sheriff had breathed a sigh of relief when Scott left Hard Luck, despite Chrissie\u2019s broken heart.</p><p>\u201cMitch never disliked Scott,\u201d Matt said. \u201cIf anything, he was doing him a favor by making him accountable for his actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>Studying her, Matt set his mug aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you? I\u2019ve never known you to meddle in anyone\u2019s love life before. Why now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Karen sighed and realized her husband was right; this wasn\u2019t her usual style. Still, what happened between Scott and Chrissie bothered her for some reason, bothered her a lot, and she felt a mother\u2019s urge to fix things, to repair the situation. Maybe she was being fanciful, but Karen saw in Chrissie the same kind of pain she herself had once felt.</p><p>\u201cIf Scott and Chrissie are meant to be together,\u201d Matt said, relaxing against the back of his chair, \u201cthen it\u2019ll happen without any interference from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKaren!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help myself,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the look that comes over Chrissie\u2019s face when anyone mentions Scott\u2019s name. And the same is true of Scott. I know what it\u2019s like to love someone so much that the hurt only seems to get worse. When we got divorced, it just about killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Matt said quietly, his gaze sobering.</p><p>\u201cWe were both stubborn and afraid and in such pain.\u201d Those weren\u2019t times Karen ever wanted to relive. Pregnant and alone in California, afraid to tell Matt about the baby, afraid not to.</p><p>\u201cAnd both of us so damn much in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it helped us communicate any better.\u201d They\u2019d been defensive and bitter. In those days it\u2019d been impossible to talk without their discussions erupting into arguments.</p> <p>Matt reached across the table and squeezed her hand. \u201cThe part about me loving you hasn\u2019t changed. All these years together proves it.\u201d</p><p>On rare occasions, her husband could actually be romantic. And it was more meaningful because Karen knew it was genuine, heart-deep, and never a mere gesture.</p><p>\u201cSo you want to help Scott get back together with Chrissie?\u201d he asked in a satisfied tone.</p><p>\u201cIf we can,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Whatever they did would have to be on the sly. Maybe a private conversation between Matt and Scott? Or a little confidential \u201cgirls\u2019 talk\u201d? They\u2019d have to figure out the best approach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be our secret,\u201d Matt agreed.</p><p>They emptied their leftover coffee into the sink and then, with a quick kiss, went about their busy days.</p> <p>CHRISSIE ARRIVED at Scott\u2019s \u201csurprise party\u201d early Friday evening. His mother opened the door, and Chrissie instantly lowered her gaze, feeling dreadful that she\u2019d been the one to spoil the surprise. Almost immediately following her second run-in with Scott, Chrissie had called Abbey and confessed her faux pas. As always, Abbey had been gracious and immediately forgiven her mistake.</p><p>\u201cChrissie, would you stop?\u201d Abbey said now, leading her into the large family home. \u201cA surprise party was a ridiculous idea, anyway. I\u2019m glad Scott knows, because it took away the pressure. Come inside and make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie didn\u2019t think that was possible. If not for Susan, she\u2019d have found a convenient excuse to miss this party. Susan, however, wouldn\u2019t have let her live it down.</p><p>Neither would Scott.</p><p>She\u2019d say one thing about Scott O\u2019Halloran\u2014he was determined. That morning, when she got to work, she\u2019d found a lovely bouquet of roses. Not just any roses, but red ones\u2014a dozen perfectly formed buds. The card had read simply Scott.</p><p>Chrissie suspected he\u2019d purchased them in Fairbanks the day before. Not that she was about to let a few beautiful roses sway her decision\u2014although they must have cost him the earth.</p><p>It would take more than flowers. A lot more! As soon as the thought went through her mind, Chrissie tensed. No. She refused to even consider any kind of reconciliation. She refused to give Scott the power\u2014or the opportunity\u2014to hurt her again. He wasn\u2019t going to find himself back in her good graces. No, sir! She\u2019d be civil, but that was it. He was part of her past, not her future, and she fully intended to keep it that way.</p><p>With a quick detour to exchange hugs with Christian and Mariah O\u2019Halloran, Chrissie headed straight for Susan, who was in the kitchen fussing with a variety of hors d\u2019oeuvres. She slid them, hot from the oven, onto large ceramic platters. \u201cChrissie!\u201d she cried when she saw her. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p> <p>Grumbling, Chrissie reached for a green olive and munched on that, rather than argue. There was no point in explaining that she was here only under protest.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Scott?\u201d Susan asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d As much as possible, Chrissie planned to spend the night avoiding him\u2014which was exactly what he\u2019d accused her of. Too bad, she told herself firmly. She had no choice. Anyway, his opinion of her behavior was irrelevant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guest of honor, you know.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie tossed her friend a dirty look and Susan laughed good-naturedly. Susan was pregnant and although the apron barely fit around her extended belly, she looked beautiful and healthy\u2014and very happy. Ron was in the family room, chatting with friends. Chrissie caught a glimpse of him as he glanced at his wife. A pang of envy shot through her at the love, the adoration, she saw in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet me take those mushrooms out for you,\u201d Chrissie offered, and Susan handed her the oven mitts. Staying busy was the key, she decided. Standing around making idle chatter, wondering where Scott was\u2014and how to stay out of his vicinity\u2014would quickly drive her insane. She had to ignore the fact that he was somewhere in this crowded room...and probably watching her.</p><p>Picking up the large platter required two hands. A moment later, she was walking into the family room, balancing it carefully, when without warning Scott appeared directly in front of her.</p><p>Chrissie couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say. Not a single thing. She stood there, doing an excellent imitation of an ice sculpture\u2014cold and unmoving.</p><p>\u201cDid you like the roses?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were very nice.\u201d She kept her voice expressionless.</p><p>\u201cThoughtful, too, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He turned toward his sister and winked.</p><p>Obviously the flowers had been Susan\u2019s idea. Chrissie should have known her friend had put him up to this.</p><p>She purposely hardened her heart and stared at him, her composure intact. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you wasted your money.\u201d Then she sidestepped him and marched into the other room, her tray of mushrooms aloft.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time Scott had sought her out at a party; the last occasion had been five years earlier, following her college graduation. He\u2019d managed to pull her aside and hand her a batch of lies about missing her and wanting her back in his life. At the time she\u2019d been so much in love with him she\u2019d cherished every word. The memory chilled her blood. She\u2019d been gullible and naive, but she wasn\u2019t now.</p><p>The O\u2019Halloran home was crowded, and Chrissie wove her way in and out, smiling, chatting, offering hors d\u2019oeuvres to the guests while Abbey welcomed late arrivals. These included Chrissie\u2019s dad, Mitch Harris, and her stepmother, Bethany. She paused, still holding her tray, and kissed both of them in greeting. She and Bethany chatted for a few minutes as Mitch moved toward Sawyer, then Chrissie resumed her duties. It might have been her imagination, but she sensed that everyone was watching her. She had the definite suspicion that all the interest she was generating had nothing to do with the crab-stuffed mushroom caps.</p><p>She was about to return to the kitchen when Scott sneaked up behind her. \u201cWe were going to have a talk, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember! I didn\u2019t agree to that,\u201d she informed him stiffly. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, there\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to clear the air,\u201d Scott persisted.</p><p>\u201cThe air\u2019s as clear as it\u2019s going to get.\u201d She edged away.</p><p>Scott followed. \u201cNot from where I\u2019m standing.\u201d</p><p>He was making this awfully hard. Chrissie could feel herself weakening; she couldn\u2019t allow that to happen.</p><p>\u201cCould I have everyone\u2019s attention?\u201d Sawyer called as he stepped into the center of the room. He held a bottle of champagne in one hand and a flute glass in the other. Anna, Ryan and several others appeared with champagne bottles and trays of glasses, pouring drinks for all the guests.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue this conversation later,\u201d Scott said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI told you before\u2014there\u2019s nothing to discuss,\u201d Chrissie insisted, her voice carrying farther than she would have liked. Several people turned to look in their direction.</p><p>\u201cOur son is home to stay,\u201d Abbey said, tears of happiness brightening her eyes.</p><p>Sawyer slipped his arm around Abbey\u2019s waist. \u201cAnd he\u2019s now a full partner in Midnight Sons.\u201d He raised his champagne glass. \u201cI\u2019d like to propose a toast. To Scott. Welcome home, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear!\u201d Matt Caldwell yelled, and his words echoed around the room as glasses were lifted in Scott\u2019s honor.</p><p>\u201cSpeech, speech,\u201d Ryan, Scott\u2019s seventeen-year-old half brother, shouted.</p><p>Scott groaned, but his objections were quickly overruled when his family and friends took up the cry. He moved closer to his parents and grabbed Ryan by the shoulders, squeezing hard. \u201cThanks a lot, little brother,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Everyone laughed. Scott looked a bit uncomfortable and needed a moment to gather his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank everyone for this wonderful surprise party,\u201d he began.</p><p>The entire room erupted into laughter, and several people grinned at Chrissie. If it hadn\u2019t been in poor taste, she would have left right then and there. Scott had knowingly set out to embarrass her. She fumed and said nothing, refusing to acknowledge his statement.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything from this experience, it\u2019s that we all make mistakes, say and do things we later regret. I\u2019ve certainly committed my share of those, and will probably be guilty of more before my life is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs will we all,\u201d Mitch Harris inserted. Bethany stood beside him, smiling; she sought out her stepdaughter, who tried to look away.</p><p>From across the room her father\u2019s eyes connected with Chrissie\u2019s, too, as though to remind her that he was willing to let matters rest between him and Scott\u2014and so should she. Chrissie broke eye contact.</p><p>\u201cAs most of you know,\u201d Scott continued, \u201cI had something of a...rebellious youth.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Harris saluted the comment with a raised champagne glass, and a few guests chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI said and did things that caused grief for those I love. I know I\u2019ve hurt my family, but despite everything, they never lost faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot once,\u201d Sawyer said in agreement.</p><p>\u201cMy family and friends have put up with a great deal,\u201d Scott added, and glanced toward Chrissie. Almost immediately he turned back to his parents. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home, Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of \u201cWelcome Home,\u201d followed from everyone in the room, and again, the family and friends of Scott O\u2019Halloran toasted his return.</p><p>There was a surge of chatter then, and Chrissie went to the kitchen to assemble another platter of hors d\u2019oeuvres. Susan came in shortly afterward and stared at Chrissie, obviously waiting for her to say something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snapped, glaring at her friend.</p><p>\u201cScott was talking to you just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He was talking to you, too. He was talking to everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean anything? What he said about past mistakes and regrets and all?\u201d</p> <p>Chrissie was saved from having to answer when Abbey walked in. Grateful for the escape, Chrissie edged her way out of the kitchen. Her relief was short-lived, however. No sooner had she entered the family room then Scott joined her.</p><p>\u201cWe were having a discussion...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said with an exasperated sigh. \u201cAs I recall, it was about air quality.\u201d</p><p>Scott grinned, which made his classic features even handsomer and more appealing. Chrissie doubted hers was the only heart he\u2019d broken since leaving Hard Luck.</p><p>His eyes grew solemn. \u201cI meant what I just said. I made a lot of mistakes, and I want you to know I\u2019m sorry for the pain I caused you.\u201d</p> <p>Chrissie dropped her own eyes, rather than let him see how deeply his words affected her. She\u2019d never expected Scott to apologize, and it took her a moment to absorb. \u201cApology accepted,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCan you really forgive me?\u201d He clasped her shoulders and compelled her to look at him.</p><p>Chrissie knew what he was asking, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could say what he wanted her to. \u201cI have forgiven you. I put everything behind me years ago, Scott.\u201d</p><p>He expelled an enormous sigh as if he\u2019d been waiting a long time to hear that. For an uncomfortable moment he gazed into her fate. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019d like to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo out with you,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAs in date. I\u2019d like us to start again.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, Lord, she was tempted. Where she found the courage to refuse him, Chrissie would never know. Slowly she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI did say I\u2019d forgiven you, Scott,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are consequences to one\u2019s actions. Nothing you can say now will ever undo the past. I wish you well, Scott, I really do, but I\u2019m not going to risk letting you hurt me again.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a few seconds, then finally let his hands fall. \u201cI can understand that,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>He turned away, and she didn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>BETHANY HARRIS sat cross-legged on the bed, impatiently waiting for her husband to return from his final rounds. Her thoughts had been confused all evening, and she wanted to discuss the O\u2019Halloran party with him. When they\u2019d left, Mitch had dropped her off at the house, then stopped at the station to check with the night dispatcher, a habit he\u2019d developed during his twenty-five years in law enforcement. He wouldn\u2019t be long, she knew, but she was eager to talk about the events of the evening. Especially the exchange she\u2019d witnessed between Chrissie and Scott.</p><p>The sound of the door closing propelled Bethany off the bed. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back,\u201d she said, greeting her husband in the kitchen. She was barefoot, her eyelet cotton gown reaching nearly to the floor.</p><p>\u201cIs Jack in?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cPresent and accounted for,\u201d she assured him. Jack, their youngest, was a high-school student. Their older son, Jeremy, attended classes at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cDid you notice Chrissie tonight?\u201d she asked right away.</p><p>\u201cShe was helping serve, remember?\u201d Mitch reminded his wife absently. He moved into the living room, unbuttoning his shirt as he walked.</p><p>\u201cWhat Chrissie was doing,\u201d Bethany told him, \u201cwas avoiding Scott.\u201d She knew her stepdaughter well enough to recognize that Chrissie was keeping herself occupied all evening in an effort to elude Scott\u2014not that her plan had worked.</p><p>Mitch frowned and sank into his favorite chair in front of the television. \u201cI thought she was over Scott. I assumed she was willing to forgive him and ready to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she has forgiven him, but...\u201d Sitting on the arm of his chair, Bethany shook her head. \u201cAs for being over him, forget it.\u201d Half the night she\u2019d had to resist the urge to throw her arms around her stepdaughter and comfort her. How well she understood the doubts and uncertainties Chrissie felt; it was like seeing history repeat itself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better have a talk with her,\u201d Mitch said, still frowning. \u201cSomeone has to tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her what?\u201d Bethany demanded, wondering if her husband knew something she didn\u2019t. When it came to police matters, Mitch was closemouthed. As he should be. Bethany respected his discretion. But her husband sometimes kept private fears and concerns to himself, too. If he had information regarding Scott and Chrissie, she wanted to hear it.</p><p>Mitch\u2019s gaze clouded with indecision. \u201cI\u2019m not keeping any deep, dark secrets, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d He abruptly changed his mind about whatever he\u2019d planned to say. \u201cActually, Chrissie may want to talk to me about Scott, and I was hoping you\u2019d give me a few suggestions\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019d prefer to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d gladly talk to Chrissie,\u201d Bethany told him quietly, \u201cif I knew what to say.\u201d</p><p>They were both silent for a moment. \u201cI think very highly of Scott for publicly apologizing to his family,\u201d Mitch said. \u201cThat couldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a kind and generous thing to do,\u201d Bethany agreed. Scott\u2019s admission of his faults had taken maturity and inner strength; so had his decision to seek his family\u2019s forgiveness, especially in a roomful of people. Part of his speech, Bethany realized, had been directed at Chrissie.</p><p>Her stepdaughter was a warmhearted woman who\u2019d already forgiven Scott\u2014that much Bethany was certain of. But apparently forgiveness didn\u2019t extend to resuming their relationship.</p><p>Bethany had seen Chrissie leave the party soon after Scott\u2019s speech, unable to hide her misery; Bethany had desperately wanted to follow her out. She sensed that Chrissie loved Scott yet despite her feelings refused to take another risk on the man who\u2019d hurt her twice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I never told you.\u201d Her husband\u2019s eyes sparked with hidden laughter. \u201cJust before our wedding, Scott came to talk to me, man to man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott did? He was what\u2014eight? Nine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine, I think, and sincere as can be.\u201d</p><p>Bethany could only imagine what the boy had had to say.</p><p>Mitch rubbed the side of his jaw. \u201cScott felt I needed to know you were in love with me long before I ever noticed.\u201d</p><p>Bethany, who\u2019d moved to sit across from her husband, knees tucked beneath her chin, lifted her head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Mitch raised his hand. \u201cI swear it\u2019s true. Scott said he recognized the look. According to him, Abbey looked at Sawyer the same way you looked at me. He asked me if love made people act dumb because that was how his mother and Sawyer behaved. He wondered if that would happen to us.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her forehead against her knees, Bethany couldn\u2019t suppress a laugh.</p><p>\u201cApparently he didn\u2019t approve of what his sister and Chrissie had done in order to get us together, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he recommended I marry you in spite of Chrissie and Susan\u2019s matchmaking, and congratulated me for seeing through their ploys.\u201d Her husband\u2019s smile was delighted as he reminisced. \u201cI could talk to Scott,\u201d he finally suggested. \u201cMan to man, the way he spoke to me.\u201d</p><p>Bethany considered that, but instinctively knew Chrissie would resent her family\u2019s intrusion. \u201cYou\u2019ve already had a number of talks with Scott.\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s smile disappeared and he slowly nodded. \u201cHe was an angry teenager, but nothing I said helped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>Mitch leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ve seen other kids like Scott. He was never vicious or even all that bad. First there was the pain of losing his dog and then...well, this is what I started to tell you. He contacted his father when he was fifteen. He never told Abbey and Sawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Sawyer\u2019s his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy adoption, true, but Scott had things to resolve with his birth father\u2014and it didn\u2019t really happen. The bastard out-and-out rejected him. His own kid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me this before.\u201d</p><p>Mitch\u2019s eyes avoided hers. \u201cI know. He asked me to keep it confidential. But I tried to help him as best I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you did help him, although Chrissie didn\u2019t realize it at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she did later,\u201d Mitch murmured. He shook his head. \u201cScott hurt her the same way he hurt himself. Now he\u2019s back and she doesn\u2019t trust him, and really, can you blame her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Still, Bethany wished a reconciliation was possible.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should talk to Chrissie.\u201d Mitch glanced hopefully in her direction. \u201cMaybe that would be the best approach, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd say what?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>Her husband hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something inspiring. Hey\u2014you could always ask Ben for advice. Seems to me he has a knack for knowing the right thing to say.\u201d</p><p>In theory Mitch\u2019s idea sounded good, but this was a delicate situation that required sensitive handling. Chrissie might take offense at her family\u2019s meddling in her affairs. In fact, Bethany could amost guarantee it. Besides, knowing Ben, his solution would likely to be to hog-tie Chrissie and Scott and refuse to release them until they\u2019d sorted everything out.</p><p>On second thought...</p><p>\u201cYou think we should ask Ben for help?\u201d Mitch murmured.</p><p>Bethany gave a thoughtful shrug and laughed softly at the thought of leaving her stepdaughter\u2019s love life in the hands of crusty, outspoken Ben\u2014the man who also happened to be Bethany\u2019s birth father and the reason she\u2019d moved to Hard Luck in the first place. \u201cI think we should let Chrissie make her own decisions. Although, I suppose, if the right opportunity presents itself...\u201d</p><p>Mitch took a moment to mull that over. Then he nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. And you never know\u2014one of them might actually ask for our advice. In which case, we\u2019ll be happy to give it. Come on,\u201d he said, stretching his arm toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s past my bedtime.\u201d</p><p>CHRISSIE AROSE early Saturday morning and dressed warmly for her bimonthly flight into Fairbanks. As she ate some toast, she filled her backpack for the weekend, then walked to the Midnight Sons landing strip. Duke Porter, her law partner\u2019s husband, generally flew her into town. They\u2019d gotten to be good friends over the past few months, since she\u2019d started the mentoring program arranged through a Fairbanks social-service agency. Joelle Harmon was a twelve-year-old foster child at risk. Abandoned by her mother, father unknown, Joelle had been in six foster homes in four months, until she was accepted into the experimental group home. Chrissie had spent months building a strong relationship with the girl.</p><p>Her breath formed small clouds as she hurried toward the Midnight Sons office to check in for the normally scheduled flight. It would turn bitterly cold soon enough. Within the month, snow would fall and winter would set in with such ferocity that just the thought of it sent shivers down her spine. Despite that, Chrissie loved Alaska; she\u2019d lived here almost her entire life and couldn\u2019t imagine settling anywhere else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Opening the door, she stepped into the office. \u201cDuke, I\u2014\u201d She stopped as soon as she realized it wasn\u2019t Duke standing there, but Scott O\u2019Halloran.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he greeted her cheerfully. He was pouring himself a cup of coffee and didn\u2019t bother to look up.</p><p>Her smile quickly faded. \u201cWhere\u2019s Duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping in, I assume.\u201d Scott finally glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m taking the morning flight.\u201d</p> <p>Chrissie hesitated, unsure what to do.</p><p>He reached for a clipboard and headed out the door. He paused when she didn\u2019t follow. \u201cYou coming or not?\u201d he asked, as if it was of little concern to him. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now. I have some deliveries to make in Fairbanks.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie figured she didn\u2019t have any choice. She might as well get used to being around Scott, no matter how uncomfortable she felt.</p><p>Climbing into the plane, she was relieved when Scott immediately placed a pair of headphones over his ears. Making polite conversation with him would have been difficult, and at least he\u2019d circumvented any requirement to do so. He ran through a flight-check list before starting the engine of the Lake LA4 amphibious plane. He could have been flying alone for all the attention he paid her.</p><p>Frankly, that was the way Chrissie wanted it. Yet when they soared into the endless blue skies toward Fairbanks, she found herself wishing circumstances could\u2019ve been different. This wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d flown with Scott; she\u2019d been in the air with him dozens of times. In Hard Luck planes were equivalent to cars anywhere else. More than one summer\u2019s afternoon had been spent flying to nearby lakes for a refreshing swim.</p> <p>The first time he\u2019d ever kissed her had been underwater. They\u2019d done plenty of kissing above water, too. Chrissie closed her eyes, not wanting to remember.</p><p>At the first sign of Fairbanks, she relaxed, grateful to be close to her destination and away from the confines of the plane. Away from Scott. His landing was smooth, a greaser as the pilots called it, and the aircraft came down gently, touching the tarmac with barely a jolt.</p><p>\u201cNice landing,\u201d Chrissie said when Scott removed the headphones.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be flying me back tomorrow afternoon?\u201d Not that it mattered, but she wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s on the schedule.\u201d He unlatched the door and climbed out, his jaw noticeably tight\u2014as though her question had angered him.</p> <p>Refusing to allow his mood to intimidate her, Chrissie opened her own door and climbed down the wing, rejecting Scott\u2019s offer of assistance. Once firmly on the ground, she slipped her backpack over her shoulders and straightened. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly.</p><p>Without another word, Chrissie turned and started toward the terminal.</p><p>\u201cHave fun with your boyfriend,\u201d he called after her, his voice dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>Boyfriend? She couldn\u2019t imagine where he got that idea. Chrissie thought about explaining that she was mentoring a twelve-year-old girl, then changed her mind. Perhaps it was for the best if Scott believed she was involved with another man. Not many people knew about her work with the experimental foster-care program. Her parents, of course, and Tracy. She\u2019d briefly mentioned it to Ben\u2019s wife, too, but none of the details; she\u2019d only referred to visiting Joelle on a particular weekend.</p><p>Joelle\u2019s group home was a foster-care program being tested by the state. School-age children were placed in a situation similar to a boarding-school facility. Each student was assigned a volunteer mentor from the community, who spent time with the child, encouraging and listening.</p><p>Chrissie had been working with Joelle for two years and had grown to love the quiet soft-spoken child. At first it was all Chrissie could do to get the painfully shy girl to speak above a whisper. Gradually, over time, thanks to the support of the group home and the trust Chrissie had built, Joelle grew more confident. Chrissie could hardly recognize the child she\u2019d first met in the smiling chattering girl Joelle had become.</p><p>\u201cI leave at four o\u2019clock sharp,\u201d Scott shouted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on time,\u201d Chrissie responded, tossing the words over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSee that you are,\u201d he snapped, \u201cor I\u2019ll leave without you.\u201d</p><p>His parting shot annoyed her, and she jerked open the heavy glass door leading to the terminal. Her frown quickly changed to a smile as Joelle raced toward her. \u201cChrissie, Chrissie!\u201d the girl shouted. \u201cGuess what? I got an A on my essay for English!\u201d</p><p>Chrissie enveloped the girl in a hug as a surge of joy and triumph rushed through her. Joelle had come so far, and Chrissie couldn\u2019t help feeling a personal pride in the progress she\u2019d made. Every accomplishment was significant, Chrissie knew; every accomplishment took her farther from her disadvantaged past and toward a hopeful future.</p><p>\u201cOh, Joelle, I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d Simple words, spoken with heartfelt sincerity, and it was a wonder to see the smile on the girl\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a busy weekend planned for us,\u201d Chrissie told her.</p><p>Joelle wrapped an arm around Chrissie\u2019s waist. \u201cI brought my paper if you want to read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I do,\u201d she told her, and they walked out of the terminal together.</p><p>FOUR O\u2019CLOCK Sunday afternoon, as promised, Chrissie was back at the airport. Two days with Joelle, and she was exhausted. A friend who worked as a flight attendant for one of the airlines let Chrissie use her apartment. The arrangement worked well for them both. Jackie usually had weekend assignments, and whenever she was on duty, Chrissie watered her plants and brought in her mail.</p><p>Scott was waiting for her. \u201cWe may have trouble with the weather,\u201d he said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cA storm front\u2019s headed toward us. Would you understand the meteorological details if I explained them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, but I\u2019ll just take your word for it,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we stuck in Fairbanks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it. I\u2019ve been on the phone for the last thirty minutes. If we leave now, we can squeak through. Ready to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get this show on the road.\u201d He led her to the plane and Chrissie dutifully followed him and climbed inside, fastening the seat belt. Although she knew they were in a hurry, she was reassured that Scott took the time to go over the preflight checklist thoroughly.</p><p>It was nearly dusk when they soared into the sky, which was clear and cloudless. Those conditions, however, didn\u2019t last. About halfway between Fairbanks and Hard Luck, they hit thick cloud cover and heavy winds, and the plane pitched and heaved. Rain and sleet lashed them from all directions, and ice started to build up on the wings. Chrissie didn\u2019t need to be a pilot to know how dangerous that was.</p><p>Although she\u2019d flown in every type of weather, the rough-and-tumble ride unsettled her. During one particularly bad stretch, she closed her eyes and bit her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Scott asked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Talking into his headset, Scott was busy for several minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re going down,\u201d he suddenly announced, his voice emotionless.</p><p>Adrenaline bolted through her. \u201cWe\u2019re landing? Where?\u201d It was nearly nightfall and raining. She could barely make out the landscape below.</p><p>Scott, however, was concentrating on the radio, reporting the details of where they were, and he didn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>Chrissie clenched her hands tightly as he circled the area and slowly made his descent. By the time the lake came into view, her nerves were shot. Just as flawlessly as he\u2019d landed the day before, Scott guided the plane onto the water\u2019s surface and cut the engine, gliding it toward shore.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked once her heart had stopped pounding.</p><p>Scott heaved a sigh as he took off his headphones. \u201cLake Abbey. We\u2019ll wait out the storm here.\u201d</p><p>Terrific, just terrific; he\u2019d chosen the very lake where he\u2019d first kissed her. The lake Sawyer O\u2019Halloran had named after his wife.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>SCOTT MANEUVERED the plane as close to shore as possible, all the while feeling Chrissie\u2019s glare. The woman was in a rage, which was ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d invented this storm or conjured it up, although to tell the truth, he wasn\u2019t really complaining. It gave him the opportunity to talk to Chrissie without her dashing off the way she usually did whenever he was in the vicinity.</p><p>\u201cYou did this on purpose,\u201d she accused him.</p><p>\u201cIf you want something to blame, I suggest you look at the weather,\u201d Scott replied.</p><p>\u201cThe storm\u2019s only an excuse, and you know it. We never should\u2019ve left Fairbanks.\u201d</p><p>She had him there, but he\u2019d honestly believed they could slide in before the cold front hit. Rather than argue with her, he said calmly, \u201cMy family built a cabin here.\u201d He cringed at how damned convenient that sounded; not only did it seem like a setup, but she already knew about the cabin. So she probably figured he\u2019d planned this all along.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to suggest we wait out the storm there,\u201d she said scathingly.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes...\u201d No wonder she doubted him, but as God was his witness, he hadn\u2019t planned it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of your parents\u2019 cabin,\u201d Chrissie returned defiantly, crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to spend the night in the plane,\u201d he said nonchalantly. She couldn\u2019t\u2014he wouldn\u2019t allow it\u2014but she didn\u2019t know that. He\u2019d make his way to the cabin, build a fire, and if she hadn\u2019t shown up by the time he finished, he\u2019d go back for her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I intend to do.\u201d</p><p>Scott should have suspected as much. He didn\u2019t remember Chrissie being this obstinate, but then, he hadn\u2019t been around her for a number of years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the cabin,\u201d he told her, opening the aircraft\u2019s door. A bone-chilling blast of Arctic wind shook him, and he gasped at the shock of it.</p><p>\u201cI have plenty of blankets here,\u201d she told him, sounding less sure of herself now.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, just holler.\u201d He closed the door, wondering if he should drag her out of the plane right then and there. Damn her pride, she was being ridiculous\u2014again. But he quickly realized that after Chrissie had spent thirty minutes sitting in the frigid cold, her attitude would soften.</p><p>Edging along the pontoon, Scott leaped from the plane onto the shore. Luckily his boots protected his feet from the icy water. A flashlight led him toward the cabin through a night as black as he\u2019d ever seen. Moon and stars were hidden by dark clouds, and there was no snow to provide even a tiny bit of reflection. The rain still pelted down.</p><p>He reached the cabin without incident. Scott\u2019s parents, Sawyer and Abbey, had built the log structure about fifteen years earlier, with plenty of help from family and friends. It\u2019d been quite a feat and required nearly three years of planning. Naturally the cabin had no modern conveniences, but it\u2019d served as a family vacation home ever since. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as he was inside, Scott lit the lantern and set it in the window, making sure the light was visible for Chrissie, should she change her mind. He couldn\u2019t keep from looking out, although it was difficult to see anything more than the faintest silhouette of the plane.</p><p>His next challenge was to get a fire going. Luckily everything he needed\u2014logs, kindling and matches\u2014had been left within easy access for just such an emergency. Once he had the wood burning, Scott checked the cupboards. Again, his family had provided an adequate supply of canned goods. He and Chrissie shouldn\u2019t be trapped here long, four or five hours at most. The worst of the storm would pass by then, and they\u2019d be able to land safely in Hard Luck early tomorrow morning.</p><p>He had the coffeepot brewing on the old stove when he thought he heard a noise outside. It was probably just the wind, but in case it was Chrissie, he wanted to appear as relaxed as possible. If she happened to peek inside, he wanted her to think he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Throwing himself down on the big chair, he leaned back his head and closed his eyes.</p><p>Ten minutes later his patience was gone, vanished along with the pretense. Chrissie was an idiot if she thought he was going to leave her to wait out the storm in the plane while he sat, warm and cozy, inside the cabin. He grabbed his coat, determined to trudge back to the lake.</p> <p>The wind was now mixed with ice and snow, and it stung his face when he opened the door. He shone the beam of light on the narrow footpath leading to the water\u2019s edge. Shoulders hunched against the wind and rain, he kept his gaze down. The flashlight guided his steps, illuminating the walkway a few feet at a time. Scott paused when the light fell on a pair of wet boots. Chrissie.</p><p>\u201cI...I changed my mind,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Scott bit off any chastisement, although he had plenty he wanted to say. Instead, he held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated before slipping her gloved hand in his. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She moved close to his side, and his arm went about her waist as he helped her to the cabin. With the wind at their backs, propelling them forward, they were at the door within minutes.</p> <p>The cabin was warm, comfortable and surprisingly intimate, despite its size. At first Chrissie stayed near the door, as if she feared what might happen if she advanced completely into the large open room.</p><p>\u201cHow about a cup of coffee?\u201d Scott asked, his back to her.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He dared not turn around for fear she\u2019d see the amusement in his eyes. Judging by the way she maintained her distance, she apparently expected him to ravish her at any minute.</p><p>\u201cYou were able to let someone know where we are?\u201d she asked, rubbing her hands together as she stood in front of the fire, which was now burning well. The wood crackled and flames leaped merrily, casting warmth throughout the room.</p><p>\u201cDuke took the message.\u201d Her lack of trust distressed him, and the situation no longer seemed amusing.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said briskly.</p><p>He poured them each a steaming cup of fresh coffee. He found sugar but no cream; there was, however, a bottle of whiskey, and he doctored his coffee with that. Might as well get comfort where he could. She declined.</p><p>Making himself comfortable, Scott sat in the big overstuffed chair Sawyer favored. If Chrissie wanted to act like a piece of cardboard, that was fine by him, but he intended to relax. Despite the impression he\u2019d given, landing the plane during the storm had been a stressful experience. \u201cI haven\u2019t been here in years,\u201d he said, glancing around, seeing the cabin with new eyes.</p><p>\u201cMe...too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly the second he realized exactly when that last time was. Five years ago. He\u2019d been with his sister and Chrissie; it was the summer they graduated from college.</p><p>\u201cThe last time you were here was with me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Chrissie asked. She sat on the sofa across from him, huddled over her cup as though it was something that required her protection. Her boots and socks were off and drying by the fireplace. She sat with her bare feet tucked beneath her.</p><p>\u201cSeems like a lifetime ago,\u201d he said, his voice a little hoarse. He\u2019d watched Chrissie that day and he\u2019d remembered everything he\u2019d spent the past few years trying to forget. Even after he\u2019d hurt her, she\u2019d been trusting and sweet. The teenage girl he\u2019d left behind had matured into a woman. That afternoon had been one of the most wonderful of his life; it\u2019d opened his eyes to what he really wanted. All this time he\u2019d been running away\u2014from his family, his town, the people he\u2019d known\u2014and until that afternoon he hadn\u2019t realized how much he missed Chrissie, how much he needed her.</p><p>His original plan had been to fly into Hard Luck, attend the graduation party, then head out immediately afterward. His relationship with his mother and Sawyer was strained, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to over-stay his welcome. During his years away, he\u2019d made a new life for himself, first in the military and after that, in Utah. He\u2019d hurt his parents, embarrassed them. It seemed better for everyone involved if he kept out of their lives.</p> <p>To his surprise, Sawyer and his mother had been genuinely delighted to see him, and willing to put the past behind them. He\u2019d loved spending time with Susan, Anna and Ryan, and he\u2019d remained in Hard Luck for ten days. His reluctance to leave, however, was due to more than his family. Scott had lingered in town because of Chrissie.</p><p>With Sawyer\u2019s permission, he\u2019d borrowed the Cessna, had Ben pack him a lunch and then taken off with his high-school sweetheart for an afternoon of swimming and fun. As soon as he could manage it, Scott had Chrissie back in his arms again.</p><p>The minute they\u2019d kissed, those five years had dissolved and it was as if he\u2019d never left. Every time they kissed, he had another reason to stay. Every time they touched, he felt a sense of rightness. This was home. This was Chrissie, the first girl he\u2019d ever loved, the only girl he\u2019d ever loved....</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d he asked, wanting to cut off his memories before they took him into territory best left undisturbed.</p><p>\u201cExhausted,\u201d Chrissie admitted, sounding more relaxed now that she\u2019d had a warm drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll scrounge up some blankets from the loft.\u201d He was anxious to do something, preferably something that required movement. Sitting around reminiscing about the one summer afternoon he most wanted to forget wouldn\u2019t help matters. Unfortunately it was the same summer afternoon he most wanted to remember.</p><p>He straightened the ladder that led to the loft. His parents used the upper area for storage in case bears broke into the cabin. Climbing up, he discovered that his mother had packed everything neatly away for the winter, but it didn\u2019t take him long to find extra bedding.</p><p>Grabbing several blankets, he carried them down for Chrissie. She\u2019d finished her coffee and placed her mug in the sink.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, you can sleep down here on the sofa close to the fire,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the loft.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d she muttered, her voice suspiciously low.</p><p>Scott started up the ladder, then stopped. \u201cChrissie?\u201d he asked, uncertain what had changed. Clearly something had. He heard it in her voice, although she kept her head averted and he couldn\u2019t see her expression.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She sounded cheerful again.</p><p>He stepped off the rung and moved toward her.</p><p>\u201cIs everything...all right?\u201d</p><p>Turning to face him, still in the shadows, she said, \u201cListen, I know I was out of line earlier. I\u2019m sorry for what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t control the weather.\u201d They stood no more than a few feet apart, tension electrifying the air between them. Scott didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Part of him wanted to shout that it was time to put aside the hurts of the past and talk honestly. He opened his mouth to say as much but saw her stiffen and knew it was useless. She wouldn\u2019t lower the emotional barricades she\u2019d erected against him. Nor could he forget that there was another man in her life now. A man she visited in Fairbanks at least twice a month.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said again, unnecessarily. After he\u2019d stacked extra wood by the fireplace, he climbed the ladder to the loft.</p><p>He made up his bed, and when he lay down, he could see Chrissie below. She\u2019d piled blankets on the sofa, then turned off the lantern. The only light in the cabin came from the flames dancing in the fireplace, throwing shadows about the room. The wind moaned outside the door. Another time the low whistle might have lulled him to sleep, but not tonight. Not with Chrissie only a few feet below, snuggling on the sofa, warm and sweet.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he was beseiged by the memory of her kisses\u2014the taste of her mouth against his, her eager response to him, the need she created in him with a single touch.</p><p>\u201cScott?\u201d</p><p>Her soft voice startled him and he opened his eyes. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asleep yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>Anything would be better than this stilted politeness. \u201cSure, ask away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that last summer we were here?\u201d</p><p>He almost groaned aloud. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered...\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you wonder, Chrissie?\u201d he encouraged.</p><p>\u201cI need to know if what Farrah said was true. Back then. Were you engaged to marry her?\u201d She paused, then added, \u201cWas it true?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been lying on his stomach, his head resting on his folded arms. He rolled onto his back and stared blankly at the ceiling. He opened his mouth to tell her, to explain it all away\u2014but he couldn\u2019t. Yes, he had excuses and justifications for that day they\u2019d spent on the lake, when he had, in fact, been engaged to another woman. He could tell Chrissie how he\u2019d finally understood that Hard Luck was his home, that she held his heart. He\u2019d wanted to tell her, but his hands had been tied. It would have been grossly unfair to Farrah, and he owed her that one kindness before he broke off the engagement.</p><p>\u201cYour silence is answer enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any excuses, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a but, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Her voice had an edge that he\u2019d never heard before.</p><p>\u201cChrissie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, listen, it\u2019s all right, really. I shouldn\u2019t have asked. I knew, but I needed to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>At that moment he would have given anything for the ability to lie to her. Still, he couldn\u2019t make himself do it. \u201cI didn\u2019t marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cShe dumped you, huh? I don\u2019t blame her. No woman in her right mind would marry a man who\u2014\u201d She choked off the rest, took a moment to compose herself, then continued. \u201cA man doesn\u2019t give a woman an engagement ring and then get involved with a high-school flame. You deserved what you got.\u201d</p><p>Scott could hardly keep himself from saying that not marrying Farrah was his decision\u2014and the smartest move he\u2019d ever made. He thanked God that he\u2019d come to his senses in time to save them both untold heartache. They\u2019d fallen conveniently in love, and getting married had seemed the inevitable next step. Farrah was a looker, and they got along fairly well. Not until he\u2019d seen Chrissie again did he realize his mistake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d wanted to tell her the truth about Farrah that summer day. He\u2019d intended to break off the engagement once he returned to Utah and then, as soon as he was free, come back to Hard Luck and plead with Chrissie to marry him. So much for the best-laid plans. The matter of his engagement had blown up in his face when Farrah unexpectedly flew up to see him; she\u2019d arrived with great fanfare and announced to everyone within earshot that she was his fianc\u00e9e. Scott had seen the look his parents exchanged. His mother had been confused, especially after all the time he\u2019d spent with Chrissie. Sawyer had been angry and they\u2019d argued. Soon afterward, without a word to Chrissie, Scott had left Hard Luck, feeling lower than a snake.</p><p>He owed her an apology, and more. \u201cI know it comes five years too late,\u201d he ventured, \u201cbut I am genuinely sorry.\u201d</p><p>His words appeared to fall on deaf ears. Then, \u201cIs the apology meant for me or Farrah?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve given your ego a real thrill to have two women in love with you at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He let the comment slide. \u201cI\u2019d settle for just one,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>The fire popped, then briefly flamed, spreading a warm glow arouhnd the room. Scott watched as Chrissie threw aside the blankets and leaped to her feet. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d he asked, sitting up. He couldn\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d said that she found so offensive.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get something straight. You think you can bring me back to Lake Abbey, stir up a few old memories and then weasel your way back into my life. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you it isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrissie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She covered both ears and started to hum Christmas carols. \u201cI\u2019m not listening. I\u2019m not listening. Nothing you say will make one bit of difference.\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t look and sound so silly, Scott might have let the moment simply pass. Not now. Climbing down the ladder, he marched over and sat on the sofa next to her.</p><p>Gripping her shoulders, Scott looked her directly in the eyes. \u201cNothing I can say will make any difference?\u201d he questioned. \u201cThen try this one on for size. I love you, Chrissie Harris. I\u2019ve loved you half my life.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>DUKE PORTER waited until he knew Scott and Chrissie had landed safely on Lake Abbey before he left the Midnight Sons office. As he walked through his front door, taking off his wet jacket, he inhaled deeply. The scent of sage and his favorite chicken dish filled the house. He could hear sounds of laughter from his youngest daughter, Sarah Lynn.</p> <p>\u201cAre Scott and Chrissie okay?\u201d Tracy asked, carrying a chicken casserole to the dining-room table.</p><p>\u201cYes and no,\u201d Duke told her, helping himself to a black olive.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Sarah playfully slapped his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to wait for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot,\u201d he said, and winked at his middle daughter who stood a short distance away, a frown of disgust on her face. Shortly after turning fourteen, Leah had, without any warning, completely lost her sense of humor. Almost overnight, his fun-loving outgoing daughter had turned into a morose and sullen teenager. From experience, he knew it was a stage. His oldest daughter, Shannon, had forged a path through the troubled teen years, so he knew what to expect. Or so he liked to believe.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Scott did and didn\u2019t land safely?\u201d Tracy demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe landed,\u201d Duke explained, \u201conly it wasn\u2019t in Hard Luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Leah asked, her brown eyes wide with concern.</p> <p>His fourteen-year-old had a major crush on Scott O\u2019Halloran. \u201cI presume so. He thought he could beat the storm system coming our way, but he couldn\u2019t. So he decided that, rather than risk it, he\u2019d touch down on Lake Abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie\u2019s with him.\u201d</p><p>Leah slouched in the kitchen chair and pouted.</p><p>\u201cSome women have all the luck.\u201d</p><p>Tracy returned to the dining room with a pitcher of water and placed it in the center of the table. When she looked up, her eyes connected with Duke\u2019s. \u201cHow long will they hole up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOvernight, I suspect, perhaps longer. Depends on the weather.\u201d</p><p>Tracy\u2019s bold smile triggered a responding one from Duke.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Leah asked, glancing first at her mother and then her father.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Tracy muttered.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d Duke said.</p><p>\u201cOh, puh-leeze,\u201d Leah groaned, and rolled her eyes. She nudged her younger sister. \u201cCover your eyes. Mom and Dad are going mushy on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShannon! Dinner\u2019s ready.\u201d Tracy called their oldest daughter, a high-school junior, from her room.</p><p>Shannon appeared, looking so much like Tracy that even now it took Duke by surprise. When he\u2019d married Tracy, he\u2019d envisioned a houseful of rough-and-rowdy sons; instead, he had three beautiful daughters. Not once, not for a single second, had he been disappointed. His life was full and he deeply loved his wife. In fact, marriage was the best thing that had ever happened to him.</p><p>They all sat down together and joined hands for grace. Before the completion of the \u201camen,\u201d Duke had reached for the serving spoon and leaned toward the casserole. His wife cast him a disapproving glance, which he ignored.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear someone mention Scott and Chrissie?\u201d Shannon asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stranded with Chrissie up at Lake Abbey,\u201d Leah complained. \u201cCan you imagine getting stuck in a storm with a hunk like that? Why can\u2019t it happen to me?\u201d Still bemoaning her sorry lot in life, she stretched across the table for the plate of biscuits and helped herself to one.</p><p>Duke quickly grabbed a biscuit before he got shortchanged; it\u2019d been known to occur. To his surprise, Tracy had turned out to be a excellent cook. He\u2019d had his doubts when he first married her, and with good reason. Once, during their brief courtship, he\u2019d visited her in Seattle and she\u2019d insisted on making dinner. The meal had damn near killed him. But soon after they were married, she\u2019d taken cooking lessons from Mary Hamilton and proved to be an apt pupil.</p><p>Duke had to give all due credit: His wife was a marvel. She\u2019d gone into this marriage convinced she could do it all and have it all. She\u2019d claimed she could maintain her career as an attorney and keep up with the ever-increasing demands of being a wife and mother. And for the most part, she had. They\u2019d planned the first two additions to their family. It wasn\u2019t until Sarah Lynn was born that Tracy took a leave of absence from the law firm. With infinite wisdom\u2014and with advancing age\u2014she\u2019d declared that yes, she could have it all, just not at the same time. When Sarah Lynn started kindergarten, Tracy put on her attorney\u2019s suit again. Three years ago Chrissie Harris had joined the law office and was working out well.</p><p>Within ten minutes, all three girls had eaten and vanished. Duke and Tracy lingered over the last of their coffee.</p><p>\u201cSo...Scott and Chrissie are stuck up at Lake Abbey,\u201d Tracy said, bracing her elbows on the table and holding her coffee cup in both hands.</p><p>\u201cStir any memories?\u201d Duke teased.</p><p>She smiled. Twenty years earlier Duke and Tracy had been involved in a fairly serious airplane crash. Tracy had been living in Seattle at the time, and she\u2019d flown up to Hard Luck to attend a friend\u2019s wedding. Duke had been scheduled to fly her into Fairbanks for her connecting flight to Seattle. The two of them had clashed from the moment they\u2019d met, a couple of years before. Tracy Santiago was everything Duke disliked in a woman; he found her bossy, independent and headstrong. He\u2019d derived real pleasure from baiting her and soon discovered she could more than hold her own. Tracy had viewed him as an unreasonable male chauvinist pig\u2014one of the few men who truly fit that now-dated expression. Their arguments and dislike of each other had been legendary.</p><p>Then the plane had gone down, and Duke was badly hurt. He\u2019d broken his arm and sustained internal injuries. During the long hours before the rescue team arrived, Tracy had shown herself to be both capable and compassionate. While she confidently dealt with the crisis at hand, caring for him and guiding the rescue party to the downed plane, Duke realized he\u2019d done something very foolish. He\u2019d gone and fallen in love with her.</p><p>Tracy loved him, too, and had the wisdom to recognize that although they were vastly different, they had everything necessary to make a good life together. Duke had just needed some time and distance to appreciate what Tracy already knew.</p><p>He\u2019d claimed, in the days before Tracy, that he wanted a conventional wife. One who\u2019d stay home with the children, bake cookies and do other wifely things. None of that interested Tracy. He\u2019d married her, convinced he\u2019d survive on frozen dinners the rest of his life, but by then he\u2019d loved her too damn much to care. Over the years there\u2019d been some bad meals, but more than enough fabulous ones to maintain the balance. Some of the inedible dinners he\u2019d cooked himself. Tracy wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d changed; he\u2019d done his fair share, too.</p><p>Twenty years and three daughters later, he was more than willing to admit how right she\u2019d been. Not that their years together had been easy. On plenty of occasions he\u2019d been convinced they\u2019d made a big mistake, but he refused to give up on their marriage. And she felt the same way. What mattered most was the love and the commitment they shared. The fact that they were both hardheaded, stubborn fools had turned out to be an advantage.</p><p>\u201cAre you remembering the crash?\u201d Tracy asked.</p><p>Duke nodded. \u201cI think it\u2019s poetic justice that Scott and Chrissie are stuck up there together. He loves her.\u201d</p><p>Tracy didn\u2019t immediately agree.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d Duke asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about Scott,\u201d Tracy said with a thoughtful look, \u201cbut I certainly know how Chrissie feels.\u201d</p><p>So the two women had talked about Chrissie\u2019s relationship with Scott. It shouldn\u2019t surprise him, seeing that they worked together. \u201cWhen did Chrissie mention Scott? What did she have to say?\u201d Duke pried.</p><p>\u201cActually she didn\u2019t say a word,\u201d his wife told him, standing. \u201cWe don\u2019t generally discuss our personal lives at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said...\u201d Duke trailed her into the kitchen. \u201cHow do you know about Chrissie\u2019s feelings if she didn\u2019t mention Scott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way I always know,\u201d Tracy said casually, putting the butter dish back in the refrigerator. \u201cIt\u2019s what people don\u2019t say that\u2019s more informative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls!\u201d Duke shouted to his three daughters. \u201cDishes.\u201d</p><p>His order was followed by a chorus of protesting groans, all coming from different parts of the house. Duke ignored them, as did his wife.</p><p>Tracy retired to the living room and reached for the mystery novel she was currently reading. Normally Duke would turn on the television, but he left it off this evening.</p><p>\u201cI hope Scott and Chrissie can work it out,\u201d he said, relaxing in his comfortable chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tracy glanced up. \u201cSo do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything interesting on television tonight?\u201d</p><p>Tracy continued to read. \u201cThere\u2019s a documentary on Discovery I was hoping to catch. Something about frogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not on too late, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She raised her eyes to meet his.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking of making an early night of it.\u201d</p><p>Tracy returned to her book. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was a test of his determination not to laugh. Tracy knew full well what he had in mind. After being married to him all these years, how could she not know?</p><p>\u201cYou coming to bed early or not?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d she said, the corner of her mouth quivering. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>THE CABIN HAD BEEN quiet for more than a hour, and Chrissie was convinced Scott had gone to sleep. His breathing was regular and even. She wished the sound of it would lull her to sleep, as well, but so far it hadn\u2019t. She envied his ability to drift off like this, especially after their heated discussion.</p><p>Scott had claimed he loved her\u2014and she\u2019d laughed at him. That probably wasn\u2019t the most tactful response, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. He didn\u2019t honestly expect her to believe him, did he?</p><p>No man in his right mind treated a woman the way Scott O\u2019Halloran had treated her. They\u2019d both said some things tonight that would\u2019ve been better left unsaid, and then he\u2019d stalked away, climbed into the loft and promptly fallen asleep.</p><p>His ability to put their discussion behind him so quickly only went to prove that she was right. Otherwise how could he possibly sleep now? It made no sense. Not when she worried and fretted, rehashing their argument, the anger and resentment churning inside her. If he did love her as he\u2019d said, then he should be upset, too; he should care. Clearly he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Their argument, however, was only part of what was keeping Chrissie awake. Hunger contributed its own pangs to her sleepless state. She and Joelle had eaten a late breakfast, but that was almost twelve hours ago. If she read her watch right, it was now 10:00 p.m. She squinted down at her wrist, trying to make out the miniature numbers on her uselessly elegant watch. Maybe it was only nine, she thought; nevertheless, she was famished.</p> <p>The way she figured, she had two options. She could stay up, seethe with resentment toward Scott and listen to her stomach growl, or she could be angry with Scott and quietly investigate the canned goods in the kitchen.</p><p>The second option held more appeal. As silently as possible, she threw aside the quilts and tiptoed toward the kitchen. The latch on the cupboard door was tricky and she couldn\u2019t see to get it open, no matter what she tried. She felt so frustrated she wanted to slam her fist against it.</p><p>\u201cYou have to be smarter than a bear,\u201d Scott said from behind her.</p><p>Chrissie whirled around. \u201cI thought you were asleep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sighed heavily, wanting to avoid another confrontation with him\u2014although she wouldn\u2019t back down if he started one. Gone was the shy teenage girl he\u2019d jilted and the young college graduate whose heart he\u2019d broken. She was a woman now, and perfectly able to deal with the likes of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s nod was stiff, distrustful.</p> <p>\u201cBreakfast in bed, was it?\u201d he asked in a sarcastic tone.</p><p>At first Chrissie was going to disabuse him of that idea, then decided she should let him believe what he wanted. He didn\u2019t know her, and time had proved he never had known her. Not really. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d She said the words flippantly.</p><p>He reached behind her, his hand grazing her ear, and twisted the cupboard knob. The door instantly sprang open. The top of her ear, where his finger had inadvertently touched, burned hotly. She didn\u2019t want his touch to affect her like this.</p><p>\u201cYou can leave now, thank you very much,\u201d she muttered fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry, too,\u201d he said. Leaning forward, he grabbed a can from the shelf. Wanting to avoid any further chance of contact with him, Chrissie stepped to one side, but all she managed to do was position herself more securely in his arms.</p><p>His ability to fluster her only irritated her more. She stiffened, and Scott\u2019s brows arched when he noticed her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way,\u201d she offered, eager to escape the circle of his arms.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, nor did he move.</p><p>She watched as his eyes narrowed. Wondering how much he could see in the firelight, she prayed that not a hint of what she really felt was reflected on her face. Her heartbeat was out of control, and her mouth had gone completely dry. She didn\u2019t dare moisten her lips for fear he\u2019d read that as an invitation to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cScott...let me go.\u201d She waited for him to release her.</p><p>He did so with obvious reluctance, dropping his arms to his sides. He stepped away, and she saw his eyes harden\u2014and then he did something so unexpected, so underhanded, that for one shocking moment, Chrissie couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>Not in the gentle sweet way she remembered. Not the cherished kisses of their youth, the memory of which she\u2019d carried with her all these years. Instead, his mouth was hard on hers, the kiss wild and dangerous, stealing the very breath from her lungs.</p><p>Chrissie gasped and would have protested further if Scott had allowed it. Pinned against the cupboard, Chrissie had no means of escape. She tried to break it off, tried not to enjoy the familiar taste of him. It\u2019d been five years since he\u2019d last kissed her. She shouldn\u2019t remember, shouldn\u2019t savor his touch. She was strong and capable. Yes, she was. But one kiss and already she could feel herself weakening. He\u2019d hurt her deeply, but she found herself thinking there was probably a legitimate reason for the things he\u2019d done. Already she was making excuses for him!</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She wrenched away.</p><p>He hesitated, eyes puzzled. \u201cWhy did you...?\u201d</p><p>Oh, what the hell. But if he was going to kiss her, it would be on her terms, not his. Grabbing him by the shirt collar, she jerked his face toward hers. If he wanted to kiss, then it would be a kiss he wouldn\u2019t soon forget.</p><p>Scott gave a deep growl and half lifted her from the floor. Her feet dangled several inches off the ground, but by this point Chrissie wasn\u2019t about to let a little thing like suspended animation distract her. The kiss was unrestrained, intense, and she let it continue, wanting to make sure he knew she hadn\u2019t been lying home at nights wondering about him.</p><p>When he ended it, his breathing was ragged. Hers, too. Chrissie pressed the back of her hand to her lips and boldly met his look.</p><p>\u201cI hope that answers your questions,\u201d she said as pleasantly as she could.</p><p>\u201cWell...not really.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, but she was quick enough to sidestep him. \u201cNo, that was a mistake, and one that won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me to court?\u201d Scott returned to the main part of the cabin, dropped into the chair, then leaned forward and ran his fingers through his hair. \u201cTell me about him,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoel.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie could hardly believe her ears. \u201cJoel! You want to hear about Joel?\u201d</p><p>His response was to glare at her from across the room.</p><p>Outraged, Chrissie glared right back. \u201cIs that why you kissed me, because you couldn\u2019t bear the thought of me being with another man?\u201d Whatever appetite she\u2019d experienced earlier faded away, and she merely felt hollow, not hungry. Her legs weren\u2019t all that steady, either. Shocked and a little disoriented, she sank onto the far end of the sofa.</p><p>This explained everything. He was jealous. Everything he\u2019d said and done had been prompted by his fear that she was involved with someone else. The minute he learned Joel was really Joelle, his interest would wane. It was all a game to him.</p><p>A game Chrissie refused to play any longer. \u201cFor your information, it isn\u2019t Joel I go to see, it\u2019s Joelle.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he looked up. \u201cJoelle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s twelve, and I\u2019m her mentor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2014\u201d he spoke slowly, deliberately \u201c\u2014it isn\u2019t a man you fly out to spend time with every other weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. Not a man. A twelve-year-old girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said nothing. All right,\u201d she added, wanting to be as fair as possible, \u201cI might have let you believe it was a man, but you were the one who suggested it in the first place. I don\u2019t know who gave you that impression, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen,\u201d he muttered, his frown deepening.</p><p>Chrissie closed her eyes and shook her head. She\u2019d mentioned Joelle once to Mary, who must have told Ben. Clearly he\u2019d either misheard or jumped to the wrong conclusion or both.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Ben about me?\u201d she asked suddenly. She didn\u2019t like the idea of Scott discussing her\u2014with Ben or anyone else. That thought angered her even more. \u201cYou have some nerve, I\u2019ll say that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrissie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Chrissie me. I\u2019m not a naive sixteen-year-old, nor do I have stars in my eyes. I know exactly the kind of man you are.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIf you did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Refusing to give him the last word, she muttered, \u201cFine with me, too.\u201d</p><p>It seemed a sad way to end their conversation, if indeed it could be considered a conversation. Scott returned to the loft with an opened can of beans and a fork; she jerked the blankets over her shoulders. Wordlessly she sat and guarded the fire, trying to forget Scott\u2019s kisses.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cWELL?\u201d MARIAH O\u2019HALLORAN glanced up from the secretary\u2019s desk where she filled in one day a week at the Midnight Sons office. Years earlier she\u2019d been one of the first women to respond to the O\u2019Hallorans\u2019 advertisement; she\u2019d accepted the position of secretary and ended up marrying her boss.</p><p>Christian gently closed the door and slumped into the chair nearest her desk. Her husband wore a strange look, and Mariah didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cScott and Chrissie are back, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d She hated it when Christian made her dig for every little detail. He knew that she and half the residents of Hard Luck were dying to hear what had happened between Scott and Chrissie. Everyone had hoped the two of them would mend their differences while stranded on Lake Abbey.</p><p>In her eyes the situation was ideal. The two of them alone together while the storm raged outside. Christian claimed she was an incurable romantic, but if that was true, then so was almost everyone in Hard Luck. \u201cI want to know about Scott and Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the rest of the town. There must\u2019ve been a hundred people at the airfield this morning when they landed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mariah leaned forward. \u201cDid it look like everything\u2019s okay with them?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Christian said with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cThe minute the engine stopped, Chrissie had the door open and was scrambling out. Seemed to me she was in an awful rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d This wasn\u2019t encouraging news. \u201cWhat about Scott? Did he go after Chrissie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Christian frowned. \u201cHe took off in the opposite direction. Now that I think about it, he seemed to be in a rush himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s comment surprised her, since he rarely showed any interest in other people\u2019s romantic problems.</p><p>\u201cI think the world of Scott,\u201d Christian went on to say.</p> <p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy\u2014turned out well. I know he had a few problems as a teenager, but lots of boys do. I certainly don\u2019t hold it against him. Hey\u2014remember when he read Susan\u2019s diary and wrote comments in the margins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d Mariah said, grinning. She agreed that Scott had turned out well. In more than one sense. He was a fine-looking man. Mariah had watched him, Susan and Chrissie mature into young adults. From the time Scott and Chrissie were in high school, she\u2019d known they shared a special bond. Like almost everyone in Hard Luck, she\u2019d assumed that one day they\u2019d marry. Only, she\u2019d apparently assumed wrong, and that saddened her.</p><p>\u201cYears ago,\u201d Christian said, stretching out his legs, \u201cbefore we got married, Scott and I had a talk...about women.\u201d</p><p>Mariah managed to hold back a smile. She didn\u2019t even want to think what a nine-year-old boy had to say on that subject.</p><p>\u201cScott offered me some advice,\u201d Christian said, grinning broadly, \u201chaving to do with romance and the two of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me after all these years that you married me on the advice of a fifth-grade boy!\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s eyes avoided hers. \u201cI guess it wasn\u2019t exactly advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Scott bragged about the help he\u2019d given others\u2014like Sawyer and Matt Caldwell and even Mitch Harris\u2014when it came to love and marriage.\u201d Christian shook his head, a half-amused grimace on his face. \u201cHe suggested he could help us, too\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, but I would\u2019ve come to the right conclusion\u2014eventually.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou\u2019d decided to leave Hard Luck, and I was pretty down in the mouth about it.\u201d</p><p>In Mariah\u2019s opinion, Christian\u2019s memory was a bit flawed. \u201cYou fired me, if I remember correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s because I was crazy about you. I thought if you were gone, then\u2014 But I don\u2019t want to get sidetracked here. All I can remember is how bad I felt when I realized you were actually going to leave. Nothing was working out the way I thought it would.\u201d His eyes held hers for an extra-long moment. \u201cThe fact is, I\u2019m as crazy about you now as I was then.\u201d</p> <p>Mariah resisted the urge to walk around her desk and kiss her husband\u2014but only because she wanted to hear the rest of his story.</p><p>\u201cYou remember what it was like back then, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t, either. Christian claimed he\u2019d been down in the mouth, but it didn\u2019t compare to how she\u2019d felt. The weeks after she\u2019d left her position at Midnight Sons had been some of the bleakest of her life. To this day, Mariah didn\u2019t know what she would have done without her friends. Matt and Karen had provided housing and encouragement. Abbey, Lanni O\u2019Halloran, Bethany\u2014they\u2019d all rallied around, offering comfort and advice when all she\u2019d wanted, all she\u2019d ever wanted, was for Christian to love her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems odd to remember a conversation I had with a kid almost twenty years ago,\u201d Christian admitted, smiling wryly, \u201cbut in some ways, it\u2019s as if it took place yesterday. That\u2019s how clearly I remember Scott giving me his advice to the lovelorn\u2014and talking about Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me that one day he was going to marry her, freckles and all.\u201d</p><p>Mariah smiled. \u201cThat boy had sense even then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately he appears to have lost it,\u201d Christian murmured. He glanced at his watch, and looked surprised when he noted the time. Leaping to his feet, he said, \u201cGotta go. Are you picking up the boys from soccer practice this afternoon or am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, and smiled at his look of relief. Both their sons were enthusiastic about indoor soccer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be glad when they can drive themselves,\u201d he said on his way out the door.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she agreed. Their two boys, born thirteen months apart, were in their mid-teens. The fun years, as Bethany Harris and Tracy Porter were quick to tell her. They were wonderful kids, and Mariah didn\u2019t expect any trouble with them. Both were crazy about sports. The oldest, Tyler, loved to fly and often accompanied Christian on his scheduled flights. He was a sociable, gregarious boy. The younger, Travis, while as athletic as his brother, was more of an introvert.</p><p>\u201cSee you tonight, then,\u201d Christian called.</p><p>Mariah went over to the door and watched her husband leave. She hadn\u2019t quite made it back to her desk when the door opened a second time, and to her astonishment Scott O\u2019Halloran walked in. He looked none too pleased.</p><p>\u201cChristian here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just left,\u201d Mariah told him. \u201cIf you hurry, you can catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, thanks.\u201d Scott began to head out the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about you,\u201d Mariah said, and regretted it the instant the words were out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Scott hesitated at the door.</p><p>\u201cChristian was remembering some advice you once gave him about romance.\u201d</p><p>Scott seemed puzzled. \u201cI gave Christian advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t any surprise you don\u2019t remember,\u201d she said, making light of it, \u201cespecially since you were only a kid at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment, then decided it wouldn\u2019t do any harm for him to know. \u201cYou were quite the matchmaker in those days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d he said, grinning for the first time. \u201cI left that to Susan and Chrissie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way I remember it,\u201d Mariah said.</p><p>\u201cThose really were the good old days,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNow that I think about it, maybe you\u2019re right. When I was twelve or so, I toyed with the idea of writing an advice column. I even talked to Lanni about putting it in her newspaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty enterprising of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when you consider what a hopeless mess my own love life is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScott, that\u2019s not true.\u201d Mariah felt sorry for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure things aren\u2019t hopeless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true,\u201d Scott countered.</p><p>He seemed utterly defeated, and Mariah suddenly wanted to throw her arms around him, as though he were one of her sons. \u201cChristian seemed to think you got him thinking in the right direction,\u201d she said bracingly.</p><p>Scott\u2019s expression was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you told Christian worked. We have a long-standing marriage to prove it.\u201d She had his interest now. \u201cIf you love Chrissie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariah, let me stop you here. It\u2019s over. Chrissie isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you believe it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re wrong. She as much as told me so this weekend. And I think it\u2019s probably for the best.\u201d</p><p>THE ENTIRE OFFICE fell quiet when Chrissie entered. Everyone stared at her as she walked in. The secretary, Kate, jumped up from her desk immediately, clutching a handful of files, and followed her down the short hallway.</p><p>\u201cWe were all worried when we heard you\u2019d been held up by the storm,\u201d Kate told her.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing to worry about,\u201d Chrissie muttered, wanting to avoid the subject. She reached for the stack of mail on her desk, shuffling through it.</p><p>\u201cI have your appointment calendar for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave it with me,\u201d Chrissie instructed. In other circumstances, she would have headed directly home, soaked in a hot tub and slept through the day. Mondays, however, were often hectic. She had appointments all morning, and it was too late to reschedule them now.</p><p>No sooner had she sat down behind her desk than there was a polite knock at her door.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Tracy stuck her head in. \u201cGlad you got here safe and sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything go all right?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. \u201cReasonably well, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The worst of the storm hadn\u2019t passed until daylight, and by the time she and Scott returned, the entire town of Hard Luck had heard about their predicament. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, their families, friends and neighbors had all rushed to the airstrip, eager to welcome them back. Unfortunately, at that stage, Chrissie and Scott were barely on speaking terms.</p><p>Everyone, her parents included, had stared at them with great anticipation, obviously expecting their engagement to be announced on the spot.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d Tracy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Chrissie promised. \u201cListen...there\u2019s something I want to talk over with you later.\u201d</p><p>Tracy frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d explain it now, but there isn\u2019t time. My first appointment is due in ten minutes and I have to read through his file. Can we talk this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>Tracy nodded. \u201cOf course. Whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Her partner\u2019s words touched her. \u201cThanks,\u201d Chrissie whispered as Tracy quietly closed the door.</p><p>Chrissie buried her face in her hands. It didn\u2019t help that she was exhausted, not having slept the entire night. How could she, with Scott only a few feet away? She doubted he\u2019d gotten any more sleep than she had.</p><p>Scott had left the cabin well before dawn and gone to the plane. At first she\u2019d panicked, fearing he\u2019d fly off without her, but then reason had reasserted itself, and she\u2019d acknowledged that, for all his faults, he wouldn\u2019t abandon her. Apparently he\u2019d made radio contact and received the latest weather information. In thirty minutes or so, he returned and told her they could leave at first light.</p><p>During the trip back she might as well have been sitting next to a robot. He didn\u2019t speak to her. For that matter, she didn\u2019t have anything to say to him, either. The situation was dreadful and destined to grow worse. Until this weekend misadventure, they\u2019d at least been cordial with each other. Now even that was gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was clear to her, if not to him, that they couldn\u2019t both stay in Hard Luck. One of them had to leave. Leaning back in her chair, Chrissie tried to think rationally about it. Since he\u2019d only recently returned and was now a partner in the family business, it didn\u2019t seem right that Scott should leave.</p><p>She was the one who\u2019d have to go. Tears threatened again, but she refused to give in to self-pity. She\u2019d move to Fairbanks, she decided. Get out of Scott\u2019s way.</p><p>That decision made, there was only one thing left to do.</p><p>Tell Tracy, and then Scott.</p> <p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>SCOTT HADN\u2019T SLEPT all night, and he suspected Chrissie hadn\u2019t, either. He was bushed. After a visit to the office to drop off his flight bag and chat briefly with Mariah, he headed home. He genuinely sympathized with Chrissie, having to work all day. But the sad fact was, she didn\u2019t want his sympathy or, unfortunately, anything else to do with him.</p><p>When he made a quick stop at the Hard Luck Lodge, Matt and Karen were openly curious about what had happened between him and Chrissie, but they accepted his vague explanation. Once in his cabin, he stood under a long hot shower and then collapsed on his bed, falling instantly asleep.</p><p>A pounding on his door woke him. Light bore into the bedroom\u2019s one window and he glanced at his clock radio, astonished to see that it was already midafternoon.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d he growled. Grabbing a pair of jeans, he hurriedly pulled them on, along with a sweatshirt. He padded barefoot to the door, yawning as he went.</p> <p>Finding Chrissie on the other side was a shock. He froze, his yawn half-completed.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d she asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and stepped aside. From the tight lines about her eyes and mouth, he could tell she hadn\u2019t had a good day. There were dark shadows beneath her eyes, and she looked in desperate need of sleep. He wondered what was so important that it couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>Chrissie peered inside the small cabin and shook her head. \u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere, then?\u201d he asked, not quite concealing his irritation.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me at the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9 in fifteen minutes?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated, thinking this probably wasn\u2019t the best time for them to discuss anything. Not with her so tired she could barely keep her eyes open and with him feeling so on edge. Despite that, he was curious. \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d he said briskly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us a booth.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door, then rubbed his face. Something was up, and he was about to learn what. It took him the full fifteen minutes to find his shoes, socks and gather his scattered wits.</p><p>The September wind cut into him as he hurried toward the caf\u00e9. As promised, Chrissie was sitting in a corner booth, her hands clutching a mug. The lunch crowd had disappeared, with only one or two stragglers. Ben and Mary stared at him, their curiosity as keen as his own.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been here all of five minutes,\u201d Ben whispered when Scott stopped to collect his own coffee.</p><p>\u201cLooking at her watch every few seconds,\u201d Mary added.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to talk to me,\u201d Scott muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see that you have as much privacy as you need,\u201d Mary assured him.</p> <p>\u201cYou settle this matter once and for all,\u201d Ben said. \u201cYou\u2019re both miserable, and the whole damn town with you.\u201d</p><p>Scott had to grin. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>He carried his coffee to the booth and slid in across from Chrissie. \u201cYou have something to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Her back was ramrod-straight, her arms unbending as she held her coffee away from her, both hands clamped around the mug.</p><p>Scott waited for several minutes, his patience wearing thin when she still didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware,\u201d she finally said, keeping her gaze focused on the tabletop, \u201cthat we have a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He wasn\u2019t being sarcastic, just inquisitive.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice how everyone gathered at the airfield?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed, all right.</p><p>\u201cHow did that make you feel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged, wondering if there was a correct answer. \u201cUncomfortable, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Her look softened perceptibly.</p><p>\u201cEveryone was expecting something from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t interested in your American Express card,\u201d he said in a weak attempt at a joke.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him, with not even a hint of humor. \u201cWhat they were looking for was some sign from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he admitted, refusing to sound defensive, \u201cand we gave it to them, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we sure did,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him as though he should have figured it out long ago. \u201cThe problem is, we\u2019ve disappointed the whole town.\u201d</p><p>His friends and family weren\u2019t nearly as disappointed as Scott himself was, but he didn\u2019t mention that. In his view, he\u2019d laid his heart on the line already. He\u2019d told Chrissie he loved her and she\u2019d laughed in his face. His pride had reached its quota for abuse, and he wasn\u2019t willing to accept more.</p><p>\u201cI feel that we can no longer both remain in Hard Luck,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as I said. One of us has to leave.\u201d</p><p>So this was what her meeting was all about. She wanted him out of Hard Luck. Well, it wasn\u2019t going to happen. This was his home, his life, and he wasn\u2019t going to let Chrissie screw it up. Not when he\u2019d done such a good job of that himself. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere; he\u2019d only recently found his way back.</p><p>His face hardened right along with his heart. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to leave.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Her answer perplexed him. \u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019d never ask that of you, Scott. I\u2019ll be the one to move. I\u2019ve been thinking about it all day, and it makes perfect sense that I should leave town. I have connections in Fairbanks and then there\u2019s Joelle and...\u201d</p><p>She rattled on, but the longer she spoke the more Scott realized how close she was to tears.</p><p>\u201cChrissie,\u201d he said, stopping her, \u201cwhy are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>She stopped abruptly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d</p><p>Tears glistened in her eyes now, and she blinked several times in an effort to hide them. Scott\u2019s frustration and anger melted away, and he resisted the impulse to reach across the table and touch her cheek, comfort her somehow. What prevented him was knowing she would resent any display of affection. He clenched his hands into fists and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking straight. Listen, go home, get some sleep, and we can talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My mind\u2019s made up. One of us has to leave, and it has to be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d After a good night\u2019s sleep she\u2019d see that and regret this entire conversation.</p><p>\u201cThis is an important decision. Let\u2019s sleep on it before you\u2014or I\u2014do something rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she argued again, her voice gaining strength. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I understand is that you\u2019ve gone thirty hours without sleep, and now isn\u2019t the time to make a critical decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I know exactly what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy should you be the one to move?\u201d he demanded, completely losing his patience now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lived here your entire life. This is your home. If anyone goes, it should be me.\u201d</p><p>Chrissie closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI refuse to let you leave.\u201d</p><p>Scott was sure he\u2019d misunderstood her. \u201cYou...love me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared as though she didn\u2019t realize what she\u2019d said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just come back. It\u2019s been a long time, and...and you can\u2019t. You\u2019re a partner in Midnight Sons. The papers have already been drawn up and...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt just makes sense that I be the one to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has any of that got to do with you loving me?\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to let the subject drop, no matter how hard she tried to talk around it.</p><p>She ignored the question and continued. \u201cI\u2019m getting to the point in my career where my practice is growing. I fly into Fairbanks regularly on business. It\u2019s logical that I live there, so I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt...was a slip of the tongue,\u201d she said through gritted teeth. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>Scott relaxed against the vinyl cushion and then slowly smiled. \u201cYou never were much good at lying.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew wide and her face reddened as she sputtered, \u201cBut...but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me, Chrissie. You\u2019ve always loved me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, refusing to respond.</p><p>\u201cI should have known it when I kissed you. I would have, too, if I hadn\u2019t been so caught up in what was happening. It was all I could do to keep from making love to you right then and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d let you,\u201d she sniffed.</p><p>She seemed ready to slide out of the booth, and Scott reached across the table and grabbed her hand.</p><p>Chrissie\u2019s gaze shot to his.</p><p>\u201cI have a better suggestion about how to settle this. A compromise.\u201d He had her attention now. \u201cOne in which neither of us has to move away from Hard Luck.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask what he meant, but he sensed her interest. He hesitated, debating the wisdom of what he was about to do. Experience had taught him to be wary with Chrissie\u2014but then, she had a right to mistrust him.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything right away. \u201cMarry you?\u201d she repeated at last.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t add any embellishments, nor would he offer her unnecessary compliments. If she couldn\u2019t already see that he was speaking from his heart, then anything else he had to say wouldn\u2019t help his cause.</p><p>\u201cScott...like you said, we need to sleep on it. We\u2019re both tired. It was an exhausting night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to sleep on it. I love you, Chrissie. I want to make you my wife. I want us both to live right here in Hard Luck, to raise our children here, to grow old here. Together.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else waiting in the wings, either. Only you.\u201d</p><p>As though she didn\u2019t trust her voice, she shook her head again and slipped out of the booth. Without a word, she started to walk away.</p><p>So that was his answer. The burden of his disappointment seemed too much to bear. He propped his elbows on the table and covered his face with his hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pack up my things and be gone by morning,\u201d he told her, his voice raw.</p><p>She stood with her back to him, but at his words, she whirled around. \u201cI told you I\u2019ll move.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I said I\u2019d go.\u201d He took his first and last sip of coffee, left the mug on the table and slid out of the booth, too.

It nearly killed me the first two times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, sweetheart.\u201d He held open his arms, and not a moment passed before she was in them. His hold was so strong he practically lifted her from the floor, then her lips were on his. She kissed him in a way that left him in no doubt of her feelings. And in no doubt that she was every inch the woman she\u2019d claimed.</p><p>\u201cThis is wonderful news!\u201d Mary cried from behind them.</p> <p>Scott heard the honking sound of Ben blowing his nose and recognized that his friend was shedding a tear of shared happiness.</p><p>Scott broke off the kiss, afraid to believe Chrissie was actually in his arms. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to wake up tomorrow morning and change your mind, are you?\u201d</p><p>Her smile told him there was no chance of that. Her expression sobered and she sighed. \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let this happen, but, Scott, oh, Scott, I\u2019m so happy it did. I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>Still he held her. \u201cDon\u2019t make any more promises to yourself, all right?\u201d</p><p>Chrissie laughed softly. \u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>And then she kissed him again.</p><p>From the Hard Luck Gazette</p><p>By Lani O\u2019Halloran, Editor</p> <p>It\u2019s official! I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that Chrissie Harris is sporting an engagement ring. I spoke with the soon-to-be-mother-of-the-bride, Bethany Harris, early this afternoon and Bethany confirmed that Scott O\u2019Halloran and Chrissie have set the wedding date for New Year\u2019s Eve.</p><p>Bethany and Mitch proudly claim credit for having brought this couple together as a result of some timely advice to the bride to be. However, this conflicts with what Matt and Karen Caldwell recently told me, which suggests that they were the ones who\u2019d played a major role in the wedding plans\u2014although when pressed Matt insisted their part in furthering the romance would remain his and Karen\u2019s secret.</p><p>The new Mrs. O\u2019Halloran will continue practicing law with Tracy Porter, while Scott\u2019s duties with Midnight Sons will expand, particulary since his father, Sawyer O\u2019Halloran, intends to retire. Sawyer and Abbey have already booked a trip to New York and are looking forward to a second honeymoon.</p><p>As a \u201cWelcome Back to Hard Luck\u201d gift, Sawyer has given his son a purebred Alaskan husky, who is a direct descendant of Scott\u2019s beloved Eagle Catcher, whom many of our readers will remember. Scott and Chrissie have both expressed their delight.</p><p>A bridal shower will be hosted by Scott\u2019s sister, Susan Gold, and will be held at the Hard Luck Community Center the sixth of November. On the same night, Ben Hamilton will host a bachelor party at the Hard Luck Caf\u00e9.</p><p>As a wedding gift, my husband, Charles O\u2019Halloran, and I, together with Mariah and Christian O\u2019Halloran, as well as Scott\u2019s parents, have presented the engaged couple with twenty acres of land\u2014and a cabin.

I\u2019ve lived in small towns all over Canada, from a remote coastal village in British Columbia, where I met my husband, to a farming and fishing village in Prince Edward Island, where my oldest child was born.</p><p>Today, I still live in a small town, this one on the banks of the Fraser River in B.C., with my family of five.</p><p>When I started writing romance novels, it made sense to write about the kind of life I knew best. Thus, the fictitious town of Glory was born, set in the beautiful Rocky Mountain ranch land and foothill country of southern Alberta. Glory is small enough for everyone who lives here to know everyone else, and big enough to supply the district\u2019s needs for groceries, doctors, lawyers and so on.</p><p>Over the past seven books, my readers have come to know Glory well. They\u2019ve seen the same characters drift in and out of the novels and have seen children grow and the librarian retire. They\u2019ve sympathized with the landlady who keeps losing her tenants to marriage and they\u2019ve waited in the doctor\u2019s office with creaking oldsters and cranky youngsters.</p><p>I love small towns. Glory\u2019s a hometown like no other\u2014and like all others. I hope you enjoy your stay!</p><p>Judith Bowen</p><p>Other Men of Glory books by Judith Bowen</p><p>HARLEQUIN SUPERROMANCE</p><p>739\u2014THE RANCHER\u2019S RUNAWAY BRIDE</p><p>791\u2014LIKE FATHER, LIKE DAUGHTER</p><p>814\u2014O LITTLE TOWN OF GLORY</p><p>835\u2014THE DOCTOR\u2019S DAUGHTER</p><p>872\u2014HIS BROTHER\u2019S BRIDE</p><p>900\u2014THE RANCHER TAKES A WIFE</p><p>and coming in November, 950\u2014A HOME OF HIS OWN</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cEVERYTHING?\u201d THE BARBER paused in the act of retrieving a bowl of hot towels from the old microwave that sat on the shelf, along with the bay rum, the jar of licorice twists, the tin of humbugs and the black-plastic comb card. He caught Jack\u2019s eye in the spotty mirror. \u201cMustache?\u201d</p><p>Jack raised both hands and felt his jaw and full luxuriant mustache, then relaxed and stretched his six-foot-plus frame under the cape. No regrets. He crossed his feet at the ankles on the chair\u2019s footrest. \u201cTake it all off, Saul. I\u2019m changing my image. Cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>Every time he came back to civilization, he treated himself to an old-fashioned shave and a haircut at Saul\u2019s Barber Emporium next to Calgary\u2019s St. Regis Hotel, a service only practitioners like Saul Crabbe still delivered. Steaming hot towels applied just so, a perfect shave with a straight razor honed on an old-fashioned leather strop, a scissor cut, plenty of bay rum splashed around afterward whether you wanted it or not.</p><p>Jack had had the mustache for years. His pride and joy. He\u2019d always secretly believed it suited him\u2014gave him a devil-may-care look. But he\u2019d ruthlessly scrutinized his appearance and general air this time when he came out of the bush and had decided: The mustache had to go.</p><p>He smiled as Saul applied the towels, one by one. Wasn\u2019t this the life? Back in the city, rested up, pockets full of money, a little pampering at the hands of a master like Saul and then...maybe he\u2019d head out to Glory once he\u2019d seen his uncle again. He had plenty to attend to out there. Or he\u2019d spend another night in town and drive out tomorrow. He wanted to buy some new clothes. And it was Halloween. There\u2019d be a party somewhere. Then he reminded himself that he was finished with that kind of thing. It was time to get serious. Forget the party life.</p><p>\u201cCleaning up? What\u2019s the occasion, Jack, my boy?\u201d The old man stared at his customer\u2019s reflection in the mirror as he critically combed through Jack\u2019s overlong hair. Black as the bottom of a well and past his collar. \u201cNew girlfriend, eh?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cI wish,\u201d he said, and shrugged slightly under the snowy white, carefully mended and patched linen barber\u2019s cape.</p><p>\u201cGirls. Huh.\u201d Saul cleared his throat and spat expertly into the brass spittoon he kept a few feet from the barber\u2019s chair, just out of eyesight of his customers. Those who chewed knew where it was; those who didn\u2019t weren\u2019t interested in having it on display. Jack had never seen the barber without a plug in one cheek.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t sound like you think much of the idea, Saul,\u201d Jack continued, closing his eyes. The warm waves of steam from the towels made him sleepy. That and his reclining position in the old leather chair.</p><p>\u201cYoung ladies today!\u201d Saul shook his head. \u201cBad news,\u201d he muttered, as if he\u2019d had some experience in that department. Saul Crabbe was sixty-six years old, and Jack happened to know he\u2019d been married for forty-two of those years to Sadie, who made the best blueberry pie east of the Rockies, according to her devoted husband.</p><p>The barber lifted the towels to inspect Jack\u2019s beard. \u201cMad Jack Gamble, isn\u2019t that what they call you up north?\u201d Saul asked. \u201cThe ladies call you that, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I know of. Just buddies, here and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know \u2018here and there.\u2019 You and that digging around looking for gold in the rocks. It\u2019s nuts. They\u2019re rocks, Jack, just rocks. You oughtta take up a real occupation. Some kind of business\u2014like barbering. Or keeping store. Take a steam-fitting course, maybe.\u201d</p><p>Jack had heard the argument before. For twelve years he\u2019d been prospecting on and off in Canada\u2019s far north. He\u2019d had his run of luck. And when he was in the money, he spread it around. His friends didn\u2019t know whether he was plain generous or plain crazy. Thus the nickname. Maybe he was crazy. He hadn\u2019t saved much in all that time. Now, with Ira\u2019s farm falling on his shoulders, he wished he had.</p><p>There was silence in the barbershop for a few minutes. The barely audible sound of a baseball game on the radio, permanently tuned to a sports station, buzzed soothingly in the background.</p><p>\u201cWorld Series?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Those damn Braves,\u201d Saul growled as he snipped at the thickest parts of Jack\u2019s beard. Jack hadn\u2019t shaved in six months. \u201cI hope they lose. I can\u2019t stand that hatchet song. Na-na-na-na. So, tell me, what\u2019s this about girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, Saul.\u201d Jack emphasized the singular. \u201cI\u2019m going to find myself a nice quiet Glory girl and settle down. Get married. Have kids. The works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down?\u201d The barber laughed, then coughed. \u201cYou? Ha! Don\u2019t pull my leg, please. I\u2019m an old man. My health\u2019s not so good anymore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. My prospecting days are over, Saul. I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019m taking up farming, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFarming?\u201d The barber wheezed with laughter and pulled on a chunk of Jack\u2019s beard. Jack winced.</p><p>\u201cOops, sorry, fella\u2014but farming? Now I\u2019ve heard everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteady there with the scissors, Saul. You ever hear me mention my uncle? Ira Chesley?\u201d</p><p>The barber shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not really my uncle, but he\u2019s related to me some way or other. Don\u2019t know exactly how. I used to spend the summers at his farm\u2014\u201d Jack frowned, thinking back to those days \u201c\u2014when I was a kid, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d spent the winters at various relatives\u2019 houses, too, ever since his mother had died, when he was eight. There\u2019d never been a father, not that he remembered, anyway, and whenever he asked, he was told to mind his p\u2019s and q\u2019s and not ask questions. Leave well enough alone, they always said. All of them, the variety of \u201caunts\u201d and \u201cuncles\u201d and \u201ccousins\u201d who\u2019d raised him. Ira Chesley had been one among many. He remembered staying with Ira\u2019s sister, too, in Saskatchewan somewhere. The Maple Creek area. But that hadn\u2019t been nearly as much fun. His aunt Minnie had made him wash and brush his hair before meals and go to church with her every Sunday.</p><p>\u201cIra\u2019s had a heart attack. He\u2019s not doing so well. He wants me to take over his farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Saul didn\u2019t sound convinced. Jack decided to shut up and let Saul shave him.</p><p>Ira Chesley had been one of the best. Jack believed that the old bachelor had actually loved him in his gruff offhand way. Ira had been kind to him, and now, when he was laid up and the doctors had said he\u2019d never farm again, who had he asked for?</p> <p>Jack Gamble. Little Jackie, Ira used to call him. And how could he refuse? Ira needed him. Ira, who\u2019d always been there for him.</p><p>And, of course, the doctors were right. Ira Chesley had to be pushing seventy. Even without this bad-heart business, his working days were numbered. Last time Jack had seen him out at the farm, two or three years ago, the old man had been so crippled up with rheumatism he could hardly put his work boots on. Now he was a thin feeble old man lying in a hospital bed, worried sick about his pack of mangy dogs back at the farm. Jack had visited him that morning on the extended-care ward and had assured him his dogs were all right. The ward gave him the creeps. Old men with dull eyes and nicotine-stained fingers grasping at the bedclothes. The pink and yellow cotton blankets, washed too many times. The smell of disinfectant and the squeak of rubber-soled shoes on granite floors. He wanted to get his uncle out of there, but he had nowhere to take him. Not until he got himself fixed up at the farm.</p><p>When he\u2019d first seen his uncle after coming out of the bush, Jack knew he\u2019d made the right decision to trade in his pickax for a pair of overalls. In fact, he was looking forward to it. Farming was a crapshoot, the way finding something worthwhile in the rocks had always been. Prospecting was a fool\u2019s game, and so was farming. Jack knew he was up to the challenge.</p><p>Only, if he was settling down for good, he needed a wife. He wanted to do things properly. He\u2019d thought it over and decided that the women he\u2019d been involved with over the past few years were highly unsuitable. He\u2019d always had a soft spot for the flashy babes, the party gals, the glamour chicks\u2014when he had the money. Not one of them was the type he\u2019d phone up to hold his hand when he had the flu.</p><p>If he was settling down and turning into a farmer, he needed a proper farmer\u2019s wife. Someone who knew how to care for kids and collect eggs, someone who knew how to put a decent meal on the table for a harvest crew, someone who could sew and bake and read stories to their children, when they came along. Help them with their homework when they were a little older. Jack wanted children, and to get children, he needed a wife. Heck, he wanted a wife. It was time.</p><p>\u201cA Glory girl, huh?\u201d Saul said, wiping away the traces of foam on Jack\u2019s face. \u201cYou figure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Saul. Just like Sadie.\u201d</p><p>Saul snorted. \u201cHa! Good luck, pal. They don\u2019t make \u2019em like my Sadie anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jack grinned, eyes still closed. He knew better. Yes, a no-nonsense small-town girl was the girl for him. A Glory girl.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>HMM. HOW MUCH soy flour could you put in oatmeal-raisin cookies without totally destroying the taste? After all, cookies weren\u2019t really meant to be nutritious.</p><p>Hannah put down the pumpkin she was mutilating in the name of Halloween and pulled the last pan of cookies from the oven, then transferred them to a wire rack. She took a sample from an earlier pan and thoughtfully broke it in two to inspect the middle. It looked good. She sniffed. Smelled good.</p><p>She chewed a piece and swallowed. With the double cinnamon and extra dollop of brown sugar she\u2019d added, if she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d substituted soy flour for a third of the regular flour, she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. And Seth Wilbee certainly wasn\u2019t going to notice.</p><p>She took up her paring knife again and adjusted the pumpkin\u2019s eye. Stab! Nutrition was important. Hannah frequently brought baked items to Seth Wilbee, the town tramp\u2014to put it kindly\u2014who lived on the other side of the big culvert, near the bridge over the Horsethief River. Hannah was sure he didn\u2019t eat properly, had probably never heard of Canada\u2019s Food Rules. She had no idea what he ate, really, although she\u2019d seen him fishing in the river and knew he had a small vegetable patch behind his shack.</p> <p>Hannah passed his culvert every day as she walked to work at the library and had taken to stuffing nutritious goodies in his mailbox as she passed. She didn\u2019t know what the big galvanized mailbox was all about\u2014she was pretty sure Seth Wilbee didn\u2019t get any mail\u2014but she put her offerings in it, anyway, raising the red flag to let Seth know he\u2019d received something.</p><p>She was planning to take him this jack-o\u2019-lantern as a gift when she\u2019d finished it. She\u2019d helped Ella Searle with her first-grade class field trip out to Sanchez\u2019s Pumpkin Farm yesterday and had come home with two for herself, one of which already sat in her living-room window grinning at passersby on the street below.</p><p>She\u2019d met Seth Wilbee several times since she\u2019d started giving him baked goods and he was always gracious, if usually rather vague. He\u2019d told her early on that he didn\u2019t care for nuts, so if it was no trouble to her, he\u2019d appreciate it if she\u2019d leave out the nuts. And once, he\u2019d invited her to tea in his shack, which had been quite an experience. That was when she\u2019d seen his garden patch.</p><p>Hannah stacked the cooled cookies in a tin she\u2019d bought earlier that week at Ripley\u2019s Department Store. It had a witch and a black cat painted on the lid, and Seth would no doubt find a use for it after Halloween. Maybe he\u2019d put the dried-out tea bags he collected from the town\u2019s restaurants in it. Or maybe straightened nails. Seth was a recycler of the first order.</p><p>Halloween tomorrow.</p><p>Hannah was torn. On the one hand, she wanted to be home in her warm comfortable two-bedroom apartment in case little trick-or-treaters came by. But there was always a problem with Joan, her parrot, who shrieked at the tiny hobgoblins, employing the dreadful vocabulary she\u2019d picked up from a former owner. Hannah had seen little children burst into tears in her hallway.</p><p>On the other hand, her sister had invited her to the opening of a new nightclub in Calgary. Hannah was tired of Emily\u2019s efforts to marry her off. Her sister\u2019s regular annoying invitations, which she just as regularly turned down, were Emily\u2019s thinly disguised attempts to match her up with poor some unsuspecting man that she\u2014Emily\u2014deemed suitable. Suitable meant little more than single and employed. She supposed Emily\u2019s intentions were good.</p><p>The younger Parrish sister by four years, Emily was convinced Hannah would never meet anyone on her own. She was just too quiet, too staid, too sensible, too...well, Emily had even gone so far as to call her boring.</p><p>Maybe it was true. Maybe she was boring. But Hannah enjoyed her quiet life. She had friends, mainly women. She was a member of three clubs in town\u2014Friends of the Library, the Glory Garden Club and a quilting group that met once a month. She read a lot. She enjoyed going out to the occasional movie or renting a video and watching it with her cat, Mr. Spitz, and Joan. Sometimes she dated Bruce Twist, the insurance salesman from the farm-insurance agency on Main Street, but not often. Or Danny Philpot, a clerk at the county courthouse. She didn\u2019t want to mislead them, but she had no real romantic interest in either man. Oh, they were nice enough. She\u2019d tried her best, but it just hadn\u2019t worked. So she usually turned them down. How could she explain that she was only interested in simple companionship? They\u2019d be sure to think she was, well, odd.</p><p>Generally, very few trick-or-treaters made it up to her second-floor apartment. Still, she didn\u2019t know if she wanted to drive all the way to Calgary for a Halloween party at some new club next to the St. Regis. The club name alone\u2014the Howlin\u2019 Tiger\u2014was enough to make her shudder. Rap, probably. And techno-stuff.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d gone out for Halloween, back in Tamarack, the small town where the Parrish girls had grown up, she\u2019d been Cinderella. Her mother had said she was too old at twelve, nearly thirteen, but Hannah didn\u2019t want to miss out on all the candy. She\u2019d never been so scared in her whole twelve years\u2014or since\u2014when she\u2019d spotted that pig\u2019s head at the old witch Mrs. Birch\u2019s house.</p><p>She\u2019d gone out with her best friend, Lorna Gagliardi and Emily. Her mother had insisted she and Lorna take Emily, who happened to be on the outs with her current friends and wanted to go trick-or-treating. Lorna had dared Hannah to go up to the witch\u2019s house. Everyone called it that. No one ever went there, especially on Halloween. It was too scary.</p><p>The house was ramshackle and unpainted and had been built at the back of the lot, well away from the street and the comfort of streetlights. Emily, she recalled, had jeered at Hannah\u2019s initial hesitation. Sometimes Emily could make her so mad. And so she\u2019d told Lorna that she\u2019d go if Lorna would.</p><p>Emily had screamed dramatically at their bravado and jumped up and down and said she was staying on the sidewalk and they weren\u2019t to be too long. Who was the scaredy-cat now? Hannah had declared with some satisfaction.</p><p>Clutching each other\u2019s hands, she and Lorna had made their way gingerly up the overgrown path to the porch, where a single low-wattage bulb burned over the door.</p><p>Her heart dropped when she pushed back the creaky screen door, the bottom half scuffed and worn. The porch was so full of stuff\u2014junk\u2014that it was no surprise they hadn\u2019t seen the head right away. Lorna knocked and Hannah stood right beside her, heart pounding, ears strained for sounds from within the dark cottage. They\u2019d heard the shuffle of slow feet. Lorna had just turned to her and whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d when her eyes widened at something behind Hannah. Hannah turned.</p><p>At first she couldn\u2019t grasp what she was seeing. Then she saw the sunken eye with pale bristly lashes, the gaping nostrils, the slack lower jaw with visible molars, oddly human. It was covered with a single layer of mosquito net or cheesecloth, maybe to keep the bugs off, although there were no bugs this late in the year. The cloth hid nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Including the blood that pooled in the bottom of the big enamel pan.</p><p>Hannah and Lorna had grabbed at each other\u2019s shoulders and screamed, and then run out of the porch, all the way to the street where Emily waited. Branches scraped at their faces, brambles tore at their bare legs. Hannah lost her glittery Cinderella shawl.</p><p>They didn\u2019t stop at the sidewalk, and Emily ran, too, yelling at them to wait up. That had been Hannah\u2019s last\u2014and final\u2014experience with Halloween.</p><p>Later, many years later, Hannah realized that poor old Mrs. Birch had probably planned to boil up her hog\u2019s head the next day with herbs and cornmeal for scrapple or headcheese, or some such rural delicacy. And, of course, she wasn\u2019t a witch at all. Just a lonely old woman who no doubt would\u2019ve been pleased to have a visitor or two on Halloween.</p> <p>Naturally, if Hannah went to the party in Calgary, there would be no need to dress up. Emily had made that clear. She\u2019d said she and her friends weren\u2019t dressing up; they were just going out for a little dancing and fun.</p><p>Hannah sat on the Queen Anne hall chair that she\u2019d recently recovered with a scrap of toile she\u2019d found on sale and pulled on her boots. Then, on tiptoe, she went back to collect the cookie tin from the kitchen counter. Joan squawked her displeasure at seeing her mistress dressed to go out, and Hannah put her fingers to her lips to shush the bird.</p><p>The phone on the kitchen counter jangled and and Hannah picked it up. Joan shrieked, \u201cBlimey! Fiddlesticks! Take off, eh?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHan? It\u2019s Em. About the party, you make up your mind yet?\u201d</p><p>Hannah stood on one foot, annoyed at the interruption. Her boots were gritty and she\u2019d just polished the hardwood hallway. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you might come? Oh, that\u2019s terrific! There\u2019s a whole bunch of us going and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018No\u2019 just means I haven\u2019t decided, Em. Look, I\u2019m ready to go out. I have some errands to take care of\u2014you\u2019re at work? Okay, I\u2019ll catch you at home tonight. \u2019Bye.\u201d</p><p>Hannah hung up and tiptoed back to the entry, carrying the carved pumpkin and the tin of cookies. Why was she even considering Emily\u2019s plan? They might be all grown-up, but sometimes Emily still felt like the taunting younger sister, now singing the refrain that Hannah didn\u2019t know how to have a good time, that she\u2019d never meet a man and fall in love, that if she didn\u2019t do something exciting once in a while, nothing would ever happen.</p><p>She\u2019d pointed out more than once that Hannah was the hideous age of twenty-eight and she\u2019d never had a boyfriend, not a real one. Which was true. You couldn\u2019t count a few snatched kisses and a feel or two with Lennie Thompson backstage at the Christmas concert in grade eight. Or the occasional holiday romance, now that she was an adult. And worst of all, Emily would wail pitifully, Hannah would die an old maid if she wasn\u2019t careful, living alone with her cats and her birds. Like that creepy old Mrs. Birch! Was that what she wanted?</p><p>Of course not. But suffering through a few parties where she was sure to be bored silly certainly didn\u2019t guarantee that she would not. Hannah was happy to leave love to chance. After all, their mother had been nearly thirty-five before she\u2019d met and married their father. Hannah wasn\u2019t worried. Things happened\u2014good things\u2014when you weren\u2019t looking for them.</p><p>And of course it would never occur to Emily that she might prefer her quiet weekends, Hannah reflected, carefully locking her apartment door behind her and nodding to Mrs. Putty, who lived two doors down and across the hall. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Putty!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLovely day, isn\u2019t it, dear? I\u2019ve just been to the Shop-Easy. Got a cake mix for a treat and a dozen eggs. Ooh, what a nice pumpkin you have there! I suppose you\u2019re getting all ready to go out to some fancy party tomorrow,\u201d Mrs. Putty wheezed, her eyes twinkling. \u201cWith some handsome young man. Oh, my. You youngsters have all the fun\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, Mrs. Putty,\u201d Hannah said with a smile that quickly faded as she headed down the stairs that Mrs. Putty had just lumbered up. We youngsters have all the fun? Still, the poor woman probably did wish she was thirty again.</p><p>Hannah delivered her cookies and put the red flag up. She set the pumpkin on top of the mailbox. Then she decided to continue walking on into town. It was her regular day off from the library\u2014Friday\u2014and she had three weeks\u2019 holidays starting next week. Other years she\u2019d gone somewhere, for at least a week of that time. Mexico once. San Francisco another time. This year she\u2019d decided to stay home.</p><p>No reason. She just couldn\u2019t think of anywhere she\u2019d rather be. And it was always a nuisance finding someone to take Joan and Mr. Spitz for a week or two.</p><p>She waved at several people she passed on Main Street\u2014knowing everyone was part of what she loved about living in Glory\u2014and popped into Foster\u2019s Drugs to pick up some dental floss. She paused at the long shelf of hair products, inspecting the pictures on the packages. Beautiful women, gorgeous hair. Her own was a plain serviceable brown, although Emily tried to convince her it was a glorious chestnut. Chestnut! Once in a while she\u2019d flirted with the idea of trying a rinse. Even trying to straighten out its jumble of curls. She usually kept it tucked up in a neat twist. Maybe now that she had three weeks off...</p><p>Or maybe not. Hannah put the box back on the shelf and left the store.</p><p>She stopped at the delicatessen to pick up half a pound of fresh-ground coffee. Kenyan, her usual. On her way past Maude\u2019s Unique Boutique, she paused to study the window. Maude Bexley had outdone herself with bats and spiders and daring black-and-orange merry widows cinching up sexy lace stockings on the headless, armless mannequins. One had on a very short leather skirt, a nearly see-through tank top and a black boa. Grinning, winking, lighted pumpkins were positioned along the bottom of the window.</p><p>Emily had said you didn\u2019t have to dress up for this party at the Howlin\u2019 Tiger. The idea was to meet other people and have fun. Supposedly you could come in whatever you were wearing.</p> <p>Hmm.</p><p>Suppose, just suppose, Hannah Parrish was the type to wear a short leather skirt and a boa?</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>JACK LISTENED to his buddy\u2019s phone ring for the tenth time and hung up. So much for that. He leaned on the small wooden shelf in front of the telephone in the hotel lobby, drumming his keys and considering who else he could call for companionship this evening when he suddenly realized he was eavesdropping on the conversation next to him.</p><p>\u201cSick? What do you mean\u2014sick? You can\u2019t be sick. You were fine this afternoon when I talked to you, and now I\u2019ve decided to come in for this...this stupid party and my car\u2019s in the garage, I can\u2019t even drive home and...and now you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m the only one here. The what?\u201d</p><p>Jack held his breath. The woman\u2019s voice was deliberately low, but he could hear the passion in it. The fury. The energy. He smiled, wondering idly what she looked like.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she began again irritably, \u201csomething to do with the starter or something, Em. Forget the car. Listen, I want to know if you\u2019re coming down here or not. You\u2019re not? And what about that guy you were meeting here? All the...the friends you said were coming?\u201d</p><p>This was getting interesting.</p><p>There was a pause, broken by an exasperated sigh. \u201cOh, that\u2019s just great. He\u2019s over at your place, holding your hand and feeding you chicken soup. Wonderful. Just make sure he\u2019s gone before I get there, because I have to sleep on the couch.\u201d Pause. \u201cHe\u2019ll be...with you. Oh.\u201d</p><p>Then, in a painfully serious voice, she said, \u201cWhat if he gets sick, Em? Whatever you\u2019ve got? That wouldn\u2019t be fair. You\u2019d better be careful. Okay, take care, Em.\u201d You could tell the woman was fond of this \u201cEm.\u201d Her initial anger had melted away. Jack heard a thump as she hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cDamn! Blimey! Fiddlesticks!\u201d Blimey? A few more unladylike sounds followed from the other phone carrel and then Jack realized that all kinds of small shiny things were rolling around his feet. She\u2019d dropped her purse. He spotted coins, two lipsticks, a small bottle of aspirin, some keys, a half roll of Rum \u2019n\u2019 Butter Life Savers, a film canister, a package of tissues.... He backed out and bent to collect them.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d He rose and held them out to her, hoping to mask the surprise that must be all over his face. She was gorgeous. About five and a half feet\u2014or she would be without those incredible three-inch platform boots. She was wearing a minuscule black leather skirt, some kind of brief glittery top, weird earrings with feathers and gold hoops, and her hair\u2014her hair was out of this world. Red, slinky, down past her shoulders. Bare shoulders.</p><p>Man, this was his lucky day.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. Jack noticed that she was blushing. He didn\u2019t think women who looked like this ever blushed. She seemed totally thrown by the loss of half the contents of her bag. And, no doubt, by the conversation he\u2019d overheard.</p><p>She\u2019d picked up the spillage on her side and now held out her hand to take the things he\u2019d collected. He gave them to her, wishing their fingers had touched. \u201cNot at all. Glad to be of help.\u201d He glanced at her left hand\u2014no ring. Not that it was of any consequence.</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d she muttered, tossing the assortment of items back into her bag and zipping it shut with a ferocious yank. She flipped back her hair with her free hand. Her eyes were stormy, tawny, flecked with green. She was a knockout. \u201cWell...\u201d She hesitated and bit her lip, an anxious childish gesture that, like the blush, didn\u2019t go with the rest of her. She looked scared. \u201cI\u2019d better get moving. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>Then she turned and stalked off toward the door leading to the new club, the Howlin\u2019 Tiger, that had just opened beside the hotel. She disappeared behind the glass-and-brass doors that led, twenty feet farther on, to the club. Jack knew, because he\u2019d checked the place out earlier, just after he\u2019d had his dinner. The setup on the bandstand and the general appearance wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. It was clearly aimed at a young crowd, and he wasn\u2019t in the mood for a lot of loud techno-rock.</p><p>He took the elevator back to his room and switched on the television. News, the World Series, a game show featuring couples who\u2019d met in a supermarket, an English sitcom, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a Disney movie... He settled down to watch something on ancient Egypt and realized twenty minutes later that his attention kept wandering away from the pharoahs.</p><p>To a certain green-eyed redhead. What was she doing in that club? Did \u201cEm\u201d ever show up? Was she with someone? No, she\u2019d said she was alone. Her car was out of commission.</p><p>Jack made up his mind. He flicked off the television and took a quick shower. He found that he was actually humming as he pulled on a clean turtleneck sweater and refastened his old Rolex. He\u2019d bought it at an auction. How many farmers wore a Rolex? A memento of one of his flusher periods. Easy come, easy go. But it was a damn fine timepiece, all the same. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slipped on one of the new jackets he\u2019d bought that day and slid his wallet into the inside pocket. Then he left the room. He pulled the door nearly shut, changed his mind and went back in to switch on a lamp beside the bed.</p><p>That was better\u2014soft glow, nice and romantic. A king-size bed was a lot of room for one person. You never could tell. He might get lucky tonight.</p><p>HANNAH MADE HER WAY to a table and sat down. She was promptly joined by a young man in leathers and dreadlocks and covered with piercings. He had to be all of twenty. \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d She hesitated, then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for some friends,\u201d she lied. Darn her sister, anyway! How sick could she be?</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said, setting down his pint of beer. Some of the foam sloshed over the side and onto the fake marble tabletop. \u201cYou want a drink? I could get you one.\u201d</p><p>She felt rattled. The call to Emily and then dumping her purse like that. What a klutz. And in front of that man! Had he overheard her? A stockbroker or something. A lawyer, maybe. He looked very trim, very city, very...handsome.</p><p>\u201cOh, no thanks. I\u2019m waiting until my friends come,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t want a drink. She needed to figure out what she was going to do next\u2014she needed to get out of here. She\u2019d stay a little while, just to let Emily think she might\u2019ve had a good time, then she\u2019d take a cab to Emily\u2019s house. She didn\u2019t want to show up too soon, not when Steve or Nigel or whoever was there. Sick! Hannah didn\u2019t believe it for a moment. In fact, she wouldn\u2019t put it past Em to have planned the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Phil. What\u2019s your name, babe?\u201d The man in leathers asked. He seemed friendly enough, although definitely not her type. Usually men didn\u2019t waltz up and talk to her. They sure didn\u2019t call her babe. Was it the crazy outfit she\u2019d worn? The hair? It had come out a lot redder than it had looked on the package. Oh well, it was supposed to wash out in eight shampoos. She\u2019d be back to her usual brown by the time she had to return to work.</p><p>\u201cName? Er, Annabel,\u201d she said; she had no idea why, except that she didn\u2019t want him to know her name. Besides, Hannah was kind of...old-fashioned. Annabel was so old it was new\u2014chic, modern, trendy.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Annabel!\u201d he said, thankfully not extending his hand. \u201cCool club, eh?\u201d He glanced around and so did Hannah. She\u2019d like nothing better than to leave right now and drive back to Glory. This had been one of her really stupid ideas. She should have followed her instincts and turned Emily down flat and stayed home tonight for the trick-or-treaters.</p><p>Some trick she\u2019d pulled on her sister! And Emily wasn\u2019t even here to find out that Hannah could dress up and have fun just like everyone else if she wanted to. It was just that she didn\u2019t really want to\u2014she\u2019d rather be home with Joan and Mr. Spitz.</p><p>Hannah narrowed her eyes. She was positive she\u2019d spotted the man she\u2019d seen in the hotel lobby, but when she stared toward the club entrance again, he wasn\u2019t there. Wishful thinking, Hannah Parrish. Besides, no man like that would ever be interested in you.</p><p>Just then a crowd of men in dreadlocks and leathers, and girls with various metal bits thrust through their lips, cheeks, eyebrows, ears, you-name-it, one wearing a lime-green fright wig, came up to the table. Hannah leaped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHere, you take my place,\u201d she offered, grabbing her purse, which she\u2019d thrown over the back of the chair.</p><p>Phil protested.</p> <p>\u201cNo, really! I\u2019ll find somewhere else to sit.\u201d</p><p>As she stumbled through clumps of people toward the door, the band started to play. Some horrifically loud crashing and screaming by the singers, and lights flashing everywhere. This was not her kind of place. If only she could get through the crowd that had materialized in the past fifteen minutes. The club\u2019s opening party was obviously a success.</p><p>\u201cLooking for someone?\u201d The voice was very close to her left ear. She raised her head. That man!</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say. She hadn\u2019t imagined him this time, he was here. \u201cNo, no\u2014I\u2019m just trying to get out so I can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...um,\u201d Hannah paused and looked around again. People seemed to be enjoying themselves. Some were dancing. She saw the young man who\u2019d been at her table moving toward her, yelling.</p><p>\u201cHey, Annabel! You left this\u2014\u201d He handed her the jacket she\u2019d draped over her chair. \u201cWhew! I see you found Annabel!\u201d he shouted, addressing the man from the lobby. \u201cLucky thing, in this crowd.\u201d Then he turned and made his way back.</p><p>\u201cNice fellow. Friend of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really. He was at my table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It had just slipped out. She hadn\u2019t told the young man with dreadlocks that she was by herself. Why had she told this man?</p><p>\u201cHere, let me take that.\u201d He slung her jacket over his shoulder and reached for her hand. Then he shouldered his way through the crowd, with her in his wake.</p><p>At the side of the club, near the mirrored wall, he smiled at her. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not alone now, Annabel. I\u2019m Jack.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cJack Gamble.\u201d He had a wonderful smile. Even white teeth. Dark eyes. A healthy tan.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d she murmured, taken aback. She shook his hand quickly. \u201cI\u2019m, er, not Annabel.\u201d She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d heard her. Oh, well. What did it matter? It was Halloween; she could be whoever she wanted.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d he asked, raising a hand to catch the attention of the waiter.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cThank you, anyway. I\u2019m not going to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He looked concerned. \u201cYou could keep me company. I\u2019m here alone, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d she returned dryly. She couldn\u2019t help smiling at him. What a line!</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019ve got to get back to my sister\u2019s place. She\u2019s sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she the one who\u2019s, er, being fed chicken soup by a gentleman friend?\u201d he asked, still smiling. \u201cShe sounds fairly well taken care of.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d heard! She felt her face go a furious red. \u201cYou heard me talking to her!\u201d</p><p>He nodded, not abashed in the slightest.</p><p>\u201cShe was supposed to meet me here. She talked me into coming. I, uh...well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not interested in the whole stupid story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, actually.\u201d He held up her jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll check this at the lobby desk for you. Just take a sec. Then let\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-sure,\u201d Hannah agreed, slipping her purse strap over her shoulder. The music didn\u2019t seem too bad anymore. Besides, wasn\u2019t that why she was here\u2014 to have fun? To meet people? The best-looking guy in the place had just asked her to dance. Could you believe the luck? And no Emily to witness it!</p><p>NOW WHY HADN\u2019T HE suggested they share a bottle of wine up in his room? Or at least invited her to accompany him to the piano bar on the tenth floor? It would be a lot quieter there. They could talk. Then, if it looked promising, they could go to his room....</p><p>But something didn\u2019t seem right to Jack. This woman wasn\u2019t as smooth or sophisticated as she appeared. Maybe she didn\u2019t get out much. She was ready to leave the club less than an hour after she\u2019d arrived. She was alone. If he hadn\u2019t come across her, she\u2019d probably be on the bus already, heading for her sister\u2019s place. In long leather boots and a tank top.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d He reached for her hand again. She had a gorgeous smile. She\u2019d actually looked relieved to see him when he\u2019d met her in the club a few minutes ago, and that didn\u2019t feel too bad, either.</p><p>They danced all evening. They ducked out to the hotel bar for a quick glass of wine and a breather. That was when he found out her name was Hannah, not Annabel. She didn\u2019t explain the mix-up, nor did she seem inclined to talk much about herself. Then, instead of ending up in his room, as he\u2019d hoped, they went back to the club and danced some more.</p><p>Just after eleven-thirty, Jack saw her checking her watch. \u201cTurning into a pumpkin?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the delightful laugh that made bubbles fizz in his bloodstream. Like fireworks. Or good champagne. \u201cIt was the carriage that turned into a pumpkin, remember? Cinderella\u2019s supposed to lose her pretty ball gown and end up back in rags.\u201d She glanced down at her skimpy skirt, the slinky tank top that just brushed the swell of her breasts\u2014Jack knew; he\u2019d already taken a quick peek\u2014and the long sexy boots. \u201cThis is hardly a ball gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice substitute,\u201d he murmured, bending to brush her knuckles with his lips. \u201cI prefer it, frankly.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been like this all evening. Back and forth. Lighthearted. Having a good time. She seemed comfortable with him, as though she truly had no idea what he\u2019d originally had in store for her. For her and him both, he decided firmly. Mutual pleasure. He was no predator. He was only willing if the lady was willing.</p><p>They\u2019d danced a few close dances, and he liked the feel of her in his arms. Perfect. He\u2019d been tempted to kiss her. Wanted to, badly. Something held him back. Honor? He must be getting foolish in his old age.</p><p>No, it had to do with intentions. He had no honorable intentions with regard to her\u2014she was just a lucky pickup, or so he\u2019d thought at the beginning of the evening. A good-time girl.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t turned out like that, either. Beneath all that sexiness and sass and apparent sophistication was a sensitive vulnerable woman. Jack sensed that, and he realized, too, that he didn\u2019t want to be the one to hurt her. He got the feeling she could definitely be hurt.</p><p>But not by him. He no longer had time for these kinds of games. Life had become serious for him the moment he\u2019d heard his uncle was so sick. \u201cReady to go? I can drive you.\u201d</p><p>She blushed again. She did that delightfully. \u201cI can get a cab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019ll drive you. Where does your sister live?\u201d</p><p>Hannah told him, then allowed him to help her on with her jacket at the desk. He had the hotel valet bring his car around, his old Mustang, the car he kept at a buddy\u2019s place in Calgary whenever he was out in the field. He\u2019d already put an ad in the paper to sell it. A sporty muscle car was not suitable transport for a farmer, and it hadn\u2019t been much use for a prospector, either. He\u2019d barely put ten thousand kilometers on it during the two years he\u2019d owned it.</p><p>He handed her in on the passenger side and shut the door firmly. He gave the attendant a ten-dollar bill in return for his keys.</p><p>\u201cHave a nice evening, sir,\u201d the valet said, with a grin and a wink.</p><p>Jack nodded and got into the driver\u2019s side. He checked the rearview mirror and the side mirrors and shifted into gear. The Mustang moved away from the curb like a tightly leashed panther. It was a beautiful machine. Harvesters were beautiful machines, too, he reminded himself. Harvesters, tractors, grain trucks.</p><p>\u201cSnazzy car,\u201d she said, with a smile and one eyebrow raised. The low bucket seat brought her minuscule skirt even higher on her silk-clad thighs. Her knees were pressed together and turned demurely toward the door. With an effort, Jack wrenched his eyes back to the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah? What did you think I\u2019d be driving?\u201d he asked, rolling down his window for a breath of fresh air. \u201cToo windy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, tossing back her hair. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be driving more of a stockbroker\u2019s type of vehicle. You know, a BMW or a Mercedes or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Jack laughed. \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you are\u2014a stockbroker? Lawyer?\u201d she asked, adding quickly, \u201cI\u2019m just guessing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He considered. Did he really want to tell her he was a small-time farmer? Or about to become one? They hadn\u2019t had much chance to talk in the club or in the bar, which had been almost as noisy. \u201cI\u2019m a geologist by trade. Prospector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally! Ever find anything exciting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like diamonds or gold? No.\u201d He shot her a look in the dark of the car, lit only by the instrument panel and the streetlights as they drove slowly up Edmonton Trail. He was in no hurry to get to the sister\u2019s, where she said she was staying. He had the impression she was just visiting Calgary, that she was from somewhere else. Edmonton?</p><p>\u201cYou ever find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. Boring useful stuff like zinc and copper. Molybdenum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She sounded dreamy, not really paying attention to him.</p><p>\u201cTurn here?\u201d He indicated the quiet residential street that ran parallel to the Bow River valley at the top of the hill. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the house up there, the one with the van parked in the driveway.\u201d</p><p>Jack noticed the van had \u201cEmily\u2019s Kitchen\u201d painted on the side. Her sister. There was another vehicle beside it, a new Bronco.</p><p>He parked and got out of the Mustang, then walked around to her side, feeling real regret that the evening was over. He opened the door for her. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She seemed at loose ends all of a sudden, the intimacy of the warm interior of the car shattered in the crisp night air. She shivered and drew her jacket closer, and Jack put his arm around her shoulders. She leaned into him for a few seconds, head bent. He squeezed her shoulders, then released her and reached for her hand. His heart was beating like crazy.</p> <p>They walked quietly up the frosty sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ring?\u201d Jack asked, ready to push the doorbell with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, putting her hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a key. Well\u2014\u201d she looked up at him \u201c\u2014thank you for everything, Jack. I had a wonderful\u2014\u201d</p><p>What the hell. He reached for her and lowered his mouth over hers, then wrapped his arms around her, pressing her tightly against him. Her mouth was soft and sweet. She\u2019d long ago lost her vampy lipstick, and he liked that. He deepened the kiss, suddenly desperate to have her, all of her. It wasn\u2019t going to happen, not in a million years. She was clearly a city gal, and he was looking for a different kind of woman to share his life. Not that one chance encounter at a noisy club meant he was even thinking along those lines, at least as far as she was concerned.</p><p>But, man, she was luscious. And beautiful. And sexy. And...inexperienced. He could tell by the way she kissed. Awkward, yet intense. The very sense he had of her vulnerability had him pulling away from her.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d He tilted her chin up. \u201cI had a great time tonight. You\u2019re one terrific lady. I won\u2019t forget you.\u201d</p><p>He took the key from her, inserted it in the lock and held the door open as she stumbled inside. She looked as shaken as he felt. \u201cGood night, Cinderella.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her hand in a feeble wave, and he closed the door and tore off down the sidewalk, cursing how quickly good luck could turn to bad.</p><p>Still, in his business, wasn\u2019t he used to that?</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>HANNAH MADE HER WAY quietly into Emily\u2019s small living room. Sheets and blankets were piled on the arm of the sofa bed. A light on the end table was the only illumination in the otherwise dark room. Hannah hoped she hadn\u2019t disturbed Emily and her...visitor, coming in late like this.</p><p>She bent down to unzip her boots and kicked them off. Then she sank onto the soft chenille upholstery of the sofa and stretched and sighed.</p><p>Jack had kissed her. He\u2019d actually kissed her! He\u2019d seemed to mean it. To really, truly want to kiss her. Hannah put her hands to her cheeks, still flushed and hot. What a night!</p><p>And then a thought struck\u2014it wasn\u2019t her he\u2019d kissed. He\u2019d kissed the person she\u2019d pretended to be, all dressed up in sexy clothes and hair dyed red. The makeup, the earrings, the\u2014</p><p>\u201cSteve!\u201d came a frightened yelp from the hallway that led to Emily\u2019s bedroom, as well as the extra bedroom she used as a home office for her catering business, and the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cEm?\u201d</p><p>Hannah was bewildered. Her sister had appeared briefly at the end of the hall, in slippers and bathrobe, then turned and streaked back down the hallway. She could hear a furious low-pitched discussion, a man\u2019s deep voice and then Emily appeared at the corner of the hallway again, just peeking into the living room.</p><p>\u201cEmily, for heaven\u2019s sake, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Hannah smiled. Her sister was incorrigibly dramatic.</p><p>\u201cHannah! Omigod, I didn\u2019t recognize you! I thought it was someone else in my house. A burglar or something. Steve!\u201d she yelled over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou can come out now\u2014it\u2019s my sister!\u201d She came over to Hannah, shaking her head. \u201cThat guy! I swear he grabbed his cell phone and dived under the bed...\u201d</p><p>She came closer and did an exaggerated double take. \u201cLook at you!\u201d She grabbed Hannah\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhat happened? What did you do to your hair? It looks fabulous. You look terrific. Are those your boots? Omigod\u2014Prada?\u201d</p><p>Hannah shot her a wry glance. \u201cA knockoff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, you could be straight out of Vogue. What\u2019s got into you?\u201d Her sister stood up and switched on another table lamp.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Hannah said wryly. She tossed her new jacket onto the arm of the sofa, revealing the glittery tank top in all its sexy splendor. It had cost a ridiculous amount of money. So had the boots, a knockoff or not. She was freezing. \u201cOh, Em. You\u2019re always telling me I\u2019m so dull. I just wanted to prove to you for once that I was capable of dressing up\u2014and then you don\u2019t show.\u201d</p><p>Emily looked guilty, but not as guilty or as sick as Hannah had expected.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t plan it this way, did you?\u201d she asked suspiciously. \u201cThrow the boring big sister out of the nest to see if she can wobble along on her own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely not!\u201d Emily sniffed and sat down again. She did sound a little congested. \u201cWas the club nice? I hear that band\u2019s really hot. You have a good time?\u201d</p><p>Hannah threw her a superior look. She was enjoying this. \u201cOh, excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, meet any guys?\u201d Now her sister was getting to the main point\u2014at least the point that interested her the most.</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d She paused for effect. \u201cOne very nice man, in particular. He drove me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Eyes alight, Emily moved closer to her on the sofa. She plucked at the soft leather of Hannah\u2019s skirt. This foray into chic had cost Hannah a month\u2019s wages. \u201cVery cool. You get that in Glory?\u201d</p><p>Hannah nodded. \u201cMaude\u2019s.\u201d She reached for the overnight bag she\u2019d left at Emily\u2019s earlier, when she\u2019d come into town. Emily had been at work. She pulled out a nightgown, her usual rose-sprigged cotton flannel, and made a silent gesture toward the hall and mouthed, \u201cSteve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind him. Here, I\u2019ll make up your bed while you go change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, Em,\u201d Hannah said firmly, her hand on her sister\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re sick\u2014remember?\u201d</p><p>She shooed her sister away and padded down the hall to the small, old-fashioned bathroom with her nightie and her toiletries bag. Back to being plain old Hannah Parrish. The car would be ready at noon. The adventure was over. It\u2019d been a lot of fun, she had to admit. But she wasn\u2019t going to make a habit of this kind of thing.</p><p>She folded her new clothes carefully and stacked them in a little pile on Emily\u2019s laundry hamper to repack. Back to sweaters and skirts. And comfortable shoes. And cotton underwear. She carefully peeled off the false eyelashes. Ouch! Back to no makeup\u2014moisturizer and maybe lip gloss. The fake fingernails could stay for now. She\u2019d paid forty bucks; she might as well enjoy them. She\u2019d work on removing them when she got home. But what if she had to live with acrylic talons? Maybe they wouldn\u2019t come off.</p><p>I\u2019ll never forget you. Had he really meant it? she wondered sadly, wiping off her eyeshadow. She\u2019d never forget him, either, but that was irrelevant. The ball was over. The prince was still a prince\u2014somewhere\u2014but Cinderella would be back to her old life in the morning.</p><p>HANNAH WENT to church with Mrs. Putty on Sunday, something she often did. The old lady was always so grateful to have company on the short walk to the church. Hannah didn\u2019t care much about the sermon, but she liked the singing.</p><p>The next day she did laundry and thoroughly cleaned her apartment, which barely needed cleaning. One person, especially a careful orderly person like Hannah, didn\u2019t make much mess. She turned up the heat and gave Joan a bath. The parrot adored water and created such havoc in Hannah\u2019s bathroom that she kept the bird\u2019s bathing down to once a week, mostly in the summer because she worried about Joan\u2019s catching cold. It wasn\u2019t summer now, so this was a special treat. \u201cAtta girl! Blimey! Atta girl! Take off, eh?\u201d Joan squawked over and over, letting Hannah know the bath was appreciated.</p><p>After her bath, Joan would spend the rest of the day quietly grooming herself, so it was worth the chaos in order to get the peace and quiet of a contented parrot.</p><p>Mr. Spitz, who was black with a white spot on his head, was no trouble. He was getting on\u2014Hannah had no idea how old he was, since she\u2019d gotten him from the High River pound\u2014and spent most of the day sleeping on top of the refrigerator or in Hannah\u2019s bay-window seat.</p><p>She washed her hair before she went to bed, the fifth shampoo since she\u2019d tinted it. She was getting a little worried. Her hair didn\u2019t show the slightest sign of fading back to its regular brown, and the tint was supposed to come out in eight washings. Good thing she still had her whole vacation ahead of her.</p><p>That was Monday.</p><p>Tuesday, she went shopping and restocked all her cupboards and made Seth Wilbee a pound cake. She put soy flour in it, too, and wondered if he\u2019d notice. She could hardly cover up the flavor with spices, not in a pound cake. At the last minute she threw in a few handfuls of raisins. Now it was a raisin cake. Extra nutrition, she told herself.</p><p>That evening she started a new needlepoint project\u2014a bellpull she wanted to give to the senior librarian, who was retiring this year, as a Christmas gift\u2014and watched something on public television. Beginning a new needlework project, usually a source of great satisfaction to Hannah, just didn\u2019t hold her interest, and after half an hour, she put it away. Even the television bored her, and by half-past nine, she was in bed reading, hair damp from the sixth washing. But she couldn\u2019t keep her mind on the story. All she saw on the page was a redheaded woman dancing with a mysterious stranger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wednesday, Hannah wrapped up the cake and took it over to Seth. This time, she decided to walk under the bridge and along the overgrown path that led to his house and deliver it in person. She realized she hadn\u2019t spoken to a soul except Joan\u2014did talking to a parrot count?\u2014since she\u2019d gone to church on Sunday with Mrs. Putty. Seth Wilbee was working in his garden, an interesting hodgepodge of unrecognizable vegetables and weeds.</p><p>\u201cHello there, miss,\u201d he said, leaning on his spade.</p><p>\u201cMighty fine cookies those were last week. Mi-ighty fine. I\u2019m very partial to raisins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought you a cake today,\u201d Hannah said, handing him the foil-wrapped loaf. Lucky about the raisins, she thought. \u201cWhat are you digging up? I thought your garden would be done by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that,\u201d the tramp said. \u201cTwo or three parsnips for my supper and a bit of celery. Parsnips don\u2019t mind the weather, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. See these leaves?\u201d He bent and lovingly ran his hand along a line of green fronds sticking out of the ground. They looked amazingly healthy for early November.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they freeze, Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I generally kick a little straw over \u2019em this time of year. But a spot of frost improves a parsnip. Sweetens \u2019em right up. I don\u2019t suppose you knew that.\u201d His pale blue eyes twinkled as she shook her head. She wasn\u2019t fond of parsnips, frost or no frost. He seemed delighted to be telling her something she didn\u2019t know.</p> <p>\u201cCome in for tea, miss. I\u2019ve got something to show ya.\u201d Seth planted his spade deeply and left it standing there. \u201cCome in! Come in!\u201d He waved her toward his shack.</p><p>Hannah hesitated, remembering the last time she\u2019d had tea, then thought, Oh, what the heck\u2014we\u2019re both lonely. And she followed him in.</p><p>The shack was no more than six or seven feet wide\u2014a corridor, really\u2014and maybe twelve feet long. A cot at the far end, with a frayed curtain in front of it, which he hastily pulled shut as she entered, was obviously Seth\u2019s bedroom. The front of the shack, near the door, had a wooden table and one chair, no doubt Seth\u2019s own handiwork, and a potbellied stove, which threw out considerable heat. There was no electricity. No lights, beyond candles and an oil lamp. No books, no magazines. No personal items, no photographs. The few pictures on the wall\u2014literally pasted to the boards\u2014had been cut from calendars and magazines.</p><p>\u201cHere, sit, miss!\u201d Seth pushed the chair toward her and rolled an empty wooden barrel on its edge to the other side of the table for himself. When Hannah had been there before, the barrel had contained an injured skunk, which Seth had been nursing back to health. There was no sign of the skunk now.</p><p>Hannah sat down and watched her host as he busied himself making tea. He wasn\u2019t an old man, probably no more than fifty. But he was worn-looking, thin and threadbare. She knew he reused tea bags that he collected in the town restaurants and caf\u00e9s, but she also knew that he kept a small canister of unused tea bags for guests. Seth poured boiling water into the two mugs he\u2019d set out on the table. She was relieved to see he was taking the cracked one for himself.</p><p>Slowly he dipped a new tea bag into first one cup\u2014hers\u2014then the other. When the water in both mugs looked fairly brown, he removed the bag, let it drip for a few seconds, then carefully pegged it to a small line strung across a corner of the shack. He was saving it for another day.</p> <p>\u201cMilk or sugar, miss?\u201d</p><p>Hannah shook her head. \u201cNo, this is just fine. And please don\u2019t cut the cake,\u201d she protested. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long. I just had lunch anyway. I\u2019m not a bit hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you say so,\u201d Seth said. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d He sat down and stared at her while she drank her tea. Pretty insipid stuff. One could only guess at how old the tea bags were. Or where he\u2019d found them.</p><p>\u201cYou said you had something to show me,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>Seth bolted up and went to his cot, where he rummaged under the mattress and produced an envelope. \u201cA letter!\u201d he said, brandishing it.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Hannah took the envelope. It was a little tatty-looking and had obviously been much handled, but Seth hadn\u2019t opened it. The letter was from the Town of Glory, addressed to Mr. Seth Wilbee.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to open it? Maybe it\u2019s important,\u201d Hannah said, laughing. The intense look on Seth\u2019s face stopped her.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead, miss. You open it,\u201d he said with a shrug that didn\u2019t quite manage nonchalance. He leaned forward and took a great slurp of his tea. His eyes never left her face.</p> <p>Hannah opened the envelope carefully. There was one sheet inside. \u201cHere\u2014\u201d She started to hand it over to him, but he gripped her wrist and pushed her hand with the letter in it back to her side of the table.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, you go ahead. You tell me what it says.\u201d His eyes still focused intently on hers. It was as though he was trying to tell her something without putting it into words. She suddenly realized: Seth Wilbee couldn\u2019t read.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, hoping her voice didn\u2019t betray her surprise. The poor man! She quickly scanned the letter, her heart sinking, then read its contents aloud to him. The town was informing him that his shack would have to be removed from municipal property immediately, that the town was planning to landscape the riverbank to integrate it into a walking and bicycle path connecting the town square to the municipal park farther upstream. He had until the middle of December to relocate.</p><p>Hannah watched his pale eyes fill with tears and his big gnarled hands begin to tremble as he attempted to hold his tea mug steady. \u201cOh, my,\u201d he said finally. Sadly. \u201cOh, my.\u201d</p><p>There were worse things, Hannah decided, than having a stubborn red tint that would not wash out of your hair and a parrot with a bad mouth.</p><p>That was Wednesday.</p><p>On Thursday, just as Hannah finished drafting a letter on Seth\u2019s behalf, asking the town to give the harmless homeless man more time to relocate, the telephone rang, and Joan squawked in protest, as she usually did. Hannah got up from her dining table to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHannah Parrish?\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s heart leaped. She knew immediately who it was. But she hadn\u2019t told him her last name....</p><p>\u201cY-yes. Speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jack. From last Friday? Jack Gamble.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>\u201cJACK!\u201d HANNAH CLUTCHED the phone in one hand, trying to shush Joan with wild gestures. The parrot ignored her.</p><p>\u201cHappy to hear from me?\u201d He sounded pleased.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that in the background\u2014a radio?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s a...a parrot. How did you get my number? Oh\u2014of course, I\u2019m pleased to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d There was a brief silence. Joan, mercifully, had shut up. \u201cI went to see your sister this morning, early. Before she went to work. She told me you were staying in Glory, that you were house-sitting for a friend.\u201d</p><p>House-sitting?</p><p>\u201cShe said you\u2019d be there for a while, she didn\u2019t know how long. I thought, hey, that\u2019s good news. Because guess where I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I have no idea, Jack,\u201d she said weakly. House-sitting? She\u2019d kill Emily!</p><p>\u201cGlory. Yeah, no kidding!\u201d he said, although she hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cI guess we never got a chance to learn much about each other on Friday. I didn\u2019t mention it, but I\u2019ve given up prospecting and I\u2019m taking over my uncle\u2019s farm. You know, once from a small town, always from small town?\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cSure. I guess so,\u201d Hannah murmured unconvincingly. She must be coming across like an idiot. He had to be wondering why he\u2019d bothered calling.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle\u2019s place. Ira Chesley, east of town, toward Vulcan. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of him?\u201d</p><p>She had. Ira Chesley lived near the Longquists on the Gallant farm. Phoebe Longquist had been one of the library\u2019s high-school volunteers. But there was no way she was getting into that\u2014why a house sitter would know of a scruffy old bachelor farmer like Ira Chesley. House sitter? \u201cIt\u2019s great to hear from you, Jack,\u201d she went on, gathering all her resources. \u201cReally great. I\u2019m so glad you called.\u201d It was true; she was delighted to hear from him. But...then what?</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe we could see each other again,\u201d he said, rushing a little. Was he nervous? Impossible!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take you out, maybe tomorrow if you don\u2019t have any other plans. Dinner? A buddy told me about a nice place in High River we could try. Japanese. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Hannah realized she was being awfully quiet. She had to say something\u2014anything. Another chance with Jack? This was just too lucky. \u201cI\u2019d love that. Shall I meet you somewhere? My car\u2019s fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll pick you up at your place. Emily gave me the address. She\u2019s a nice girl, Hannah. Very helpful.\u201d</p><p>After Jack had hung up, promising to collect her at six the next evening, Hannah dialed her sister\u2019s cell phone. Very helpful, was she? Very helpful, indeed!</p><p>\u201cBUT, HANNY, HE WAS so drop-dead gorgeous, I couldn\u2019t believe that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he\u2019d be interested in me,\u201d Hannah interjected grimly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no! I just was worried that\u2014you know, that he\u2019d wonder what a cool girl like you was doing in a boring apartment like that out there in Hicksville and, well, maybe put two and two together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want him to put two and two together! Now you\u2019ve got me in deeper, Em. I could have come clean about last Friday. Laughed it off as a Halloween thing. Now it just seems like we\u2019re a couple of liars.\u201d Hannah practically wept. She knew Emily was just trying to help her, but some help! And it wasn\u2019t as though Emily\u2019s life was on the line here.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, Hannah. I really wanted to help, that\u2019s all. Honest.\u201d Emily sniffed. She sounded suitably chastened. Hannah forgave her, as she always did.</p><p>\u201cNow maybe you can tell me how I\u2019m going to get out of this one, since you\u2019re so darn smart,\u201d Hannah returned grumpily, feeling a little better. At least Emily was contrite.</p><p>But was she really?</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve had some super ideas, Hanny,\u201d she rushed on. \u201cI\u2019ll gather up a bunch of stuff from some of my friends, some really funky clothes, and I\u2019ll drive out and you can try them all on. Something\u2019s bound to work. You want to convey, let\u2019s see, cool, class, funky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d Hannah interrupted. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get it. This isn\u2019t a part in some play, you know. All I want to convey is me. Me! Hannah Parrish. No matter how boring and ordinary. If I\u2019m too ordinary for him, then he\u2019s not my kind of guy. Maybe it\u2019s just not meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Hannah! You\u2019ve got this great chance with a super guy. Who would\u2019ve guessed he\u2019d actually come over to my place? He\u2019s persistent, too! You must\u2019ve really made an impression. I nearly died when I opened the door this morning...\u201d Off she went on her own train of thought, and Hannah tuned out. All she could think about was what a mess she was in\u2014again. Only this time it wasn\u2019t entirely her own fault. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was just one thing to do. Hannah felt her heart squeeze in regret. That was to wear the borrowed clothes Emily came up with\u2014she certainly wasn\u2019t buying any more with her own money\u2014pull off this dinner with the drop-dead gorgeous Jack Gamble and then stop answering her phone.</p><p>After that, maybe she could look for another job in a different town.</p><p>THE HOUSE-SITTING GIG was in a nice area of town, Jack thought. It wasn\u2019t where the fancy folk lived, up on Buffalo Hill, and it wasn\u2019t the seedy side of town, down on Painter\u2019s Flats. It was close to the town center, within walking distance of the town amenities\u2014the library, the clinic, the town hall, Main Street. A fairly nondescript, stucco, two-story walk-up apartment building, postwar construction. He was pretty sure it was the only actual apartment building in Glory.</p><p>The unit she was staying in was at the back, overlooking the parking lot and playing fields beyond. There was a girls\u2019 soccer game in progress. Jack took a big breath and knocked. He felt foolish now, stopping to pick up some flowers on the way. The stems felt crumpled in his hand.</p> <p>But he\u2019d thought this over carefully. He\u2019d decided he was being hasty last week in Saul\u2019s barbershop. He had to face the facts\u2014he liked party gals. Glamour babes. This idea of settling down with a quiet little Glory girl might not be such a good idea, after all. Meeting Hannah Parrish last week had helped him change his mind. She didn\u2019t strike him as the usual glamour girl, anyway. There was more to her. A lot more.</p><p>And then to find out she was here in town! Right under his nose! Jack knocked again. This time there was a hell of a racket inside, some kind of squawking. Well, she\u2019d said there was a parrot on the premises, or at least he thought that was what she\u2019d said yesterday.</p><p>\u201cOh! You\u2019re early.\u201d Hannah looked gorgeous. Tight black velvet pants, some kind of long flashy-looking tunic, dangly silver earrings, those wild boots she\u2019d had on last week...</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cOnly five minutes early. Here\u2014these are for you.\u201d He thrust the bouquet at her. She seemed taken aback.</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d She flashed him a beautiful smile and reached for the flowers. Then she moved inside.</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t you come in for a minute? I\u2019ll just put these in some water\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacko! Take off, eh? Atta girl! Take off, eh?\u201d</p><p>She took his arm as he came into the small vestibule of the apartment. \u201cOh, don\u2019t mind her. It\u2019s just Joan, my\u2014er, my friend\u2019s parrot. She can be really cranky sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that. Or, rather, hear that.\u201d Jack took full measure of the apartment as he stepped inside. Hannah disappeared into the kitchen. He made a face at the bird.</p><p>The parrot squawked and began to twirl madly on its wooden perch, croaking out the same line over and over again. \u201cTake off, eh? Take off! Jacko!\u201d A black cat sat on top of a china hutch in the dining room and stared down at him.</p><p>\u201cHow did that bird know my name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, she calls every man Jacko. A previous owner taught her to talk.\u201d Hannah called from the kitchen. Jack moved a little farther into the living room.</p><p>Other than the weird pets, the place was very nice. Cozy. Inviting. Nicely furnished. A calm peaceful place, sort of the way he\u2019d like the farmhouse to be done up once the cleaners were through with it. Ira Chesley had lived in bachelor squalor, which Jack abhorred. He\u2019d hired a crew of cleaners to come in from Vulcan, and they were finishing up on the weekend.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for the flowers!\u201d She glanced at him as he came back to stand at the entrance to the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s very thoughtful of you.\u201d She seemed genuinely pleased, and he was glad now that he\u2019d brought them. He watched as she stood on tiptoe and reached into a high cupboard for a glass vase, noting with appreciation the sleek line of the velvet over her bottom, her long legs\u2014</p><p>\u201cNice place here,\u201d he said, turning around. No need for her to catch him leering. \u201cHow long\u2019s your friend away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend? Oh...oh, a while. I\u2019m not sure. She\u2019s on a...a tour of some kind. In Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it isn\u2019t that easy to get away when you\u2019ve got a cranky parrot.\u201d</p><p>Hannah laughed. It occurred to him again that she had a delightful laugh, very musical and low. Sexy.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right there.\u201d She clipped each stem of the mixed bouquet\u2014lilies, carnations, mums, whatever\u2014and inserted it into the vase, rearranging a couple of blooms before she was satisfied.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you work?\u201d</p><p>She looked startled, even alarmed. The scissors clattered to the counter. He frowned. \u201cOh, yes, I do. But I\u2019m on holiday right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He thrust his hands into the pockets of his new trousers. He\u2019d spent a bundle on clothes last weekend, both for social occasions and for work. His bush garb of jeans and the all-weather jackets he wore for prospecting wouldn\u2019t do now that he was back in civilization.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d She smiled up at him. \u201cLovely. You can set this on the dining-room table and I\u2019ll just grab my coat.\u201d</p><p>He carried the flowers into the living-dining area. Very pleasant, he thought again. Coral walls, comfortable-looking furniture, polished end tables. Everything neat and tidy. There was an oval needlework frame standing by a chair, with a partly completed piece of work on it. Looked like the friend was a real homebody. Jack had a flash of regret. She seemed the kind of woman he\u2019d thought might one day be for him.</p><p>Until he\u2019d met Hannah.</p><p>He placed the vase in the center of the dining table, a square antique-looking piece of furniture with four chairs pulled up, all with seats in a striped plum fabric. Classy. He noticed a manila folder on the table, neatly marked, \u201cTown of Glory\u2014Seth Wilbee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d She appeared with a wrap over her arm, some slinky sexy thing. Purple and blue, all kinds of colors. It looked terrific with that long reddish hair. He\u2019d remembered it as being more vivid last week. It seemed more auburn now. And curlier. \u201cReady whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>She acted a bit nervous and Jack wondered why as he followed her out of the apartment. She locked the door carefully and didn\u2019t say anything when he took her arm. \u201cYou like Japanese food?\u201d he asked, realizing he hadn\u2019t really checked her preference.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Anything,\u201d she answered, with a breathless laugh. Maybe she was just glad to be going out. Glory hadn\u2019t impressed him as a very exciting town. He didn\u2019t think much had changed since the years he\u2019d spent summers here with his uncle Ira. When he was a kid, he hadn\u2019t noticed. Now he still didn\u2019t care, because he wasn\u2019t looking for excitement. Not since he\u2019d made the decision to settle down, to get married, to start farming, to live a whole different life.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your car?\u201d She sounded surprised. His shiny nearly new Dodge pickup was parked at the curb.</p><p>\u201cI sold it. Picked this up in Calgary the other day. Not new, but a little more useful now that I\u2019m a farmer. I hope you don\u2019t mind riding in a truck?\u201d Probably most of her dates drove some kind of flashy up-to-date vehicle. He felt a twinge of nostalgia for the Mustang he\u2019d sold.</p><p>\u201cHeavens no! You should see my old clunker.\u201d She laughed and got into the passenger side and Jack closed the door.</p><p>Heavens no. He hadn\u2019t heard that expression in a long long time. Now, if only the restaurant was decent. Jack wasn\u2019t particularly keen on foreign food, but he figured it was just the kind of trendy thing a woman like Hannah would enjoy.</p><p>He glanced at her. She\u2019d buckled her seat belt and was looking out the window with interest. A lot of houses still had Halloween decorations up.</p><p>Jack took a deep breath. Maybe he was crazy. Maybe he should\u2019ve left well enough alone. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have gone back to her sister\u2019s like that, to track her down. But...he knew he wasn\u2019t crazy. If he hadn\u2019t made the effort, he\u2019d always wonder. It was better this way, to find out if his instincts about Hannah Parrish were right.</p><p>If they were...well, he\u2019d have to decide what to do next.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cWHY FARMING? I like taking chances.\u201d He flashed her a winning smile that had her smiling back. \u201cPlanting a crop in the spring and hoping to make money off it in the fall is risky,\u201d he went on.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your uncle?\u201d Hannah said, leaning forward. \u201cWill he be coming back?\u201d They\u2019d had to wait a little before they could be seated in the small restaurant and were enjoying a drink before dinner. Enjoying? Well, Jack was having a beer, a Japanese brand. He was probably enjoying it. In a panic, Hannah had ordered something called a \u201csidecar\u201d off the cocktail menu, and it was disgusting. She rarely touched anything but sherry or a glass of wine with dinner.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the Crowfoot, extended care. Healed up fairly well, but he\u2019s weak. An old man.\u201d Jack shook his head and frowned. She felt her heart go out to him. He obviously had a great deal of affection for Ira Chesley. \u201cHe\u2019ll need more care than I can provide if I bring him home to Glory. His house is a mess. What my aunt Minnie would have called a typical bachelor\u2019s place.\u201d Jack laughed and took a sip of his beer, the devil-may-care look back on his face. \u201cI\u2019ve hired cleaners, but I need someone to fix it up. I\u2019m no decorator. You know anyone in that line of work?\u201d</p><p>Hannah would\u2019ve loved to take on a job like that. She adored decorating. But how could she offer when he thought she was only a house sitter, someone who\u2019d been accidentally plunked in Glory for a few weeks? She admired the way he felt about his uncle, a rather dour, grumpy old man\u2014at least, that was how he seemed to her. Most guys wouldn\u2019t dream of assuming that kind of responsibility for an elderly uncle.</p><p>\u201cYou want to come out and take a look at the joint? Maybe give me some ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour farmhouse? Sure! I\u2019d love to.\u201d Hannah made an effort to hold back her enthusiasm. She reminded herself that this evening was the only time she\u2019d be spending with Jack. She couldn\u2019t keep this up. Nails, hair, clothes\u2014all lies. Plus, she\u2019d decided that the red rinse was finally showing signs of fading. Soon she\u2019d be back to her usual brown. Eight shampoos! What a laugh. More like eighteen.</p><p>\u201cAnother one?\u201d He held up his drink. The waitress was headed their way.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t like it, huh?\u201d he said with a curious glance at her nearly full glass.</p><p>\u201cNo. Sorry\u2014I\u2019m not much of a drinker.\u201d She shook her head again. Maybe that wasn\u2019t what Emily or one of her friends would have admitted. But she wasn\u2019t her sophisticated younger sister. Not by a long shot. And there was a limit to how much she could pretend.</p><p>She watched as Jack talked to the waitress. He was easygoing, familiar, friendly. Emily was right. Jack was a handsome guy. He had on a dark-blue crew-neck\u2014could it be cashmere?\u2014a snazzy sports jacket and charcoal trousers. Everything looked new. Earlier, Hannah had noticed he was wearing an old Rolex. The really classy kind. Stainless steel. Not that modern Rolexes weren\u2019t classy, but, well, there was something about that forties and fifties style that never got old. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometimes she felt she should have been born then. She definitely did not suit a new millennium with her interests: cooking, needlework, watercolor painting, animals, gardening, old three-hanky black-and-white movies, books. She liked ballroom dancing, too, but she\u2019d never met a man, apart from her father, who was any good at it.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d</p><p>She was startled at the sudden warm feel of his hand on hers. \u201cY-yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go in now.\u201d He held her gaze for a few seconds and Hannah felt her blood swoosh. She caught her breath. His smile painted a picture for her, and it was an X-rated picture. She was in way over her head. Really, how desperate was she to allow herself be swept along in something like this? Well, she\u2019d had the option of coming clean. On the phone. And she hadn\u2019t, had she?</p> <p>He took her hand as they followed the hostess into the small dining room. Hannah felt very conspicuous. The place was sparely but beautifully furnished with smooth wood furniture of birch or beech and lots of subdued lighting. The sound of water trickling came from a small pond installed near the door. She could see the flash of goldfish and wondered if the copper pennies she saw glittering on the bottom harmed the fish.</p><p>Even though they\u2019d had to wait, the place wasn\u2019t that busy, less than a third occupied. Maybe they were short-staffed, Hannah thought as she accepted the large menu handed her by a smiling Japanese woman. There was some tinkly kind of music playing quietly in the background, faintly annoying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been here before,\u201d Jack confided, leaning forward. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s decent grub.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look that hopeful. Hannah smiled. She\u2019d never had Japanese food before, either.</p><p>The menu was a mystery. She\u2019d heard of sushi, but wasn\u2019t entirely sure what it was. Neither of them knew what sunomono was, and the cryptic English translation beneath the Japanese wasn\u2019t really helpful. Gyoza?</p> <p>Jack solved their quandary by suggesting that the server decide for them, bringing dinner for two\u2014including something called tempura.</p><p>\u201cIf we hate it,\u201d he said, reaching forward to take her hands in his again, \u201cwe\u2019ll just go out to McDonald\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Hannah gave a noncommittal nod. She wasn\u2019t comfortable with him holding her hands, although she didn\u2019t pull away. He seemed very physical. In a way, she liked that. She\u2019d gone out with Bruce Twist three times, and he\u2019d never even tried to kiss her. Maybe after the episode on her sister\u2019s doorstep last Friday, Jack had decided they were past the \u201cfirst date\u201d stage. Which meant\u2014what?</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about yourself,\u201d he said, sending Hannah\u2019s pulse into a skitter. \u201cWhat kind of work do you do? Where\u2019d you grow up? Is Emily your only sister?\u201d</p><p>No point panicking. She was twenty-eight; she could handle this. Hannah decided to be truthful but offer no details. \u201cEmily\u2019s my only sibling. We grew up right here in Alberta in a small town called Tamarack. I have a degree in library science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA librarian!\u201d He seemed surprised. \u201cReally? A librarian?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d This conversation could be dangerous.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your farming plans,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cAnd yourself. What are you going to, you know, plant? Grow? Whatever you call it.\u201d Might as well keep the conversation on him. Less risky.</p><p>\u201cIra\u2019s raised crops all these years, hay and grain, but I want to try something different. At least with part of the farm. Maybe you could help me...\u201d He squeezed her hand slightly, and then, to her dismay, she felt him slide his thumb gently along her palm. Omigod. The sensation zinged down to the soles of her feet and back again.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She gently withdrew her hand, pretending she needed to scratch her other wrist. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearch. I want to raise game for the restaurant trade. Deer or elk. It\u2019s a booming market. I\u2019ve already talked to suppliers about acquiring some breeding stock. In fact, on Monday I\u2019m meeting with someone in Calgary and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeer?\u201d An image of Bambi calling for his mother swam into her mind. \u201cOh, Jack, surely not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr elk. Even wild boars\u2014they\u2019re catching on.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a big investment, though. You\u2019ve got to have good high fences for deer and elk. And disease is always a concern, with a local wild population. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were intent on her, as though her opinion really mattered. Thank goodness she was on holiday for the next two weeks! That was all she needed\u2014 Jack Gamble strolling into the town library and asking for reference materials.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be raising deer,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s just not...not right.\u201d She still saw Bambi crying his big brown eyes out in front of her.</p><p>\u201cToo cute?\u201d His eyes crinkled at the corners.</p><p>\u201cYes. Forget deer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Wild pigs?\u201d He made a face at her, leaning toward her and squiggling his hands over his ears, and Hannah burst out laughing. \u201cCome on, they can be cute, too. See?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! Stop it!\u201d</p><p>He growled and snarled and snuffled like a demented pig, and Hannah felt all the tension she\u2019d been holding simply dissolve. She glanced around the room to see if anyone had noticed his antics. He suddenly stopped and slipped his hand around hers so that their fingers were entwined on the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk about something else,\u201d he said suddenly serious. \u201cYour friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend?\u201d Hannah frowned.</p><p>Just then the server arrived with a steaming pot of tea, which gave Hannah a chance to regain her composure. Jack released her hand and she sat back in her chair, feeling a little flustered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the friend you\u2019re house-sitting for? I\u2019m curious about her.\u201d The server poured the tea and left.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>That friend. \u201cWhy?\u201d Hannah really didn\u2019t want to get drawn into making up even more stuff about the friend Emily had invented.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just wondered what her name was. What kind of tea is this, do you think?\u201d He picked up his bowl and examined the amber liquid closely.</p><p>\u201cMmm, jasmine?\u201d she asked, inhaling, closing her eyes for a second or two, madly racking her brain. She\u2019d never dreamed he\u2019d ask this many questions about the so-called house-sitting job.</p><p>\u201cJasmine? That\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Jasmine Kelly.\u201d That came straight out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d He leaned forward. \u201cThe amazing thing is, if I hadn\u2019t met you first, I\u2019d be seriously interested in someone like her\u2014no kidding. She married, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Hannah sputtered her tea. \u201cMarried?\u201d she gasped. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost embarrassed to say,\u201d he answered with a grin. He looked around. \u201cListen, do you want a drink now or something with your dinner later? Wine? Sake? We can tell the waitress as soon as we see her. They serve it warmed, I\u2019m told.\u201d</p><p>Hannah felt reckless. After all, chances were that after this evening, she\u2019d never see Jack Gamble again. Especially considering the way things were going. Her guard was down, since that giggle over the wild pigs. She was bound to make a major mistake; why not live a little first? \u201cOh, sure. Let\u2019s try the sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jack smiled. \u201cYeah, I made my mind up when I decided to take over the farm that it\u2019s time I got married.\u201d He grinned and played with his chopsticks, bouncing them lightly against the side of his plate. \u201cIt\u2019s no hardship. I want to get married. Wife, kids, all that. I\u2019ve spent too many years by myself in the bush, and I\u2019m ready for a big change in my life.\u201d</p><p>Married. Hannah had clenched her hands under the table and was staring at him. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I decided the right woman for me was someone just like your friend seems to be. You know, domestic? She\u2019s got a great apartment. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s a good cook, likes kids, honest as the day is long, good-humored\u2014she has to be, look at those crazy animals she\u2019s got. A real treasure for some lucky guy. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Hannah swallowed. She couldn\u2019t speak. A horrifying prospect had just opened up in her mind. Jack was looking for...someone like her!</p><p>\u201cThis is a tough confession to make, but I\u2019ve always been a sucker for flashy good-looking women with, uh, well, you know. Appeal. Like you.\u201d His eyes were very warm on her. Very admiring. She was sure he\u2019d been going to say something like \u201cbig tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrific-looking woman. Beautiful. Sexy. That hair! I love it. I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for redheads. The way you dress\u2014cool, classy. I mean, any guy in this room...\u201d He glanced around quickly. There were two elderly couples dining on the other side of the room and a truck-driver type reading a newspaper and slurping down noodles nearby. \u201cWell maybe not in this room,\u201d he corrected himself with a grin. \u201cSeriously, any red-blooded guy would notice you right away. And he\u2019d wish he was in my shoes.\u201d</p><p>Hannah felt herself stiffen. She\u2019d never heard such garbage. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s kind of...superficial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he admitted, shaking his head, as though they were talking about someone else, not him. \u201cI admit it.\u201d He put his hand on his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s totally superficial, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m ashamed of myself. Still, I\u2019m a guy.\u201d He raised one eyebrow in boyish appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s the way guys are. But I had myself convinced I could ignore all that and go to a small town like Glory, find some nice quiet Glory girl and ask her to marry me. Just like that!\u201d He snapped his fingers and shook his head again, apparently amused at his own naivet\u00e9, then he sat back, gazing at her.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d she murmured. That was the understatement of the century. Her tea bowl was empty, and she poured herself some more. Green tea, it was, not jasmine. Her mind was whirling, and she felt a bit sick.</p><p>\u201cI realized when I met you that I was fooling myself. Hannah, I know you\u2019re going to think this makes no sense, but the minute I met you, I knew you were different. You were gorgeous, sexy, all that stuff, but you were a lot more than that. I could tell. And then, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you all the time I was in Calgary this week. I had to see you again. That\u2019s why I went back to your sister\u2019s and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she told you all about me,\u201d Hannah said quietly. All the lies. She felt tears rising and she blinked them back, afraid her eyelashes would fall off. She\u2019d only worn false eyelashes twice in her life\u2014tonight and last Friday\u2014and she didn\u2019t have a clue what they\u2019d do under pressure. She rummaged in her purse and found a tissue and dabbed at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAllergies?\u201d he asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, tucking the tissue back in her handbag. \u201cJust something in my eye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d never met a man who talked the way Jack did. He was open and honest and liked to laugh. He told jokes with a skill she could only envy. Much as she loved books, words had never come easy to her. She\u2019d labored over the exact phrasing of the letter she\u2019d sent to the municipality on Seth Wilbee\u2019s behalf, pleading for an extension of his order to move. Next week she intended to go to the open council meeting to speak up for the poor man.</p><p>She felt vaguely depressed. Where was their meal? \u201cNext thing you\u2019re going to say, I suppose, is that you fell for me right then and there. Or something like that.\u201d Some line! She\u2019d hoped he wasn\u2019t like that. How many women did he try that on? I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for redheads/blondes/brunettes. She sniffed. She wanted to blow her nose, badly. A bimbo, that was what he thought she was.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true, Hannah. I did.\u201d His voice was very deep and he looked more serious than he had all night. If he was acting, he was good at it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything, not yet. It\u2019s only our second date, right? But it is true. I saw you in the hotel lobby and something inside me just went Bingo, this is it, Jack. This is the one for you\u2014 What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>Hannah felt blindly for her handbag, which she\u2019d set down somewhere near her feet. \u201cI\u2014I have to go, uh, do something. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d She stood up, jarring the table and making the dishes rattle. If only she could reach the ladies\u2019 room before she burst into tears.</p> <p>Jack Gamble. The man of her dreams. And he\u2019d said he\u2019d be interested in her friend, if he wasn\u2019t so darn interested in her.</p><p>He\u2019d said she was exactly his type. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Sexy. Line or not, no one had ever called her those things before. And after this evening, no one ever would again.</p><p>Except maybe Joan. What kind of life was that\u2014depending on a bird for compliments?</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>JACK STARED after her. There was nothing wrong with her eye. It was him; it had to be him. He\u2019d come on too strong, dammit. He hadn\u2019t meant to say all that about her being the one for him. And doing his dumb pig impression\u2014was that any way to impress a lady? There was just something about Hannah. She made him do things. Say things. Confessions he wouldn\u2019t have told his best friend\u2014or barber. And he\u2019d only seen her twice, known her less than a week! Less than a day, when it came right down to it.</p> <p>\u201cYour wife? She will be back?\u201d The server looked worried as she began to place the serving dishes on the table.</p><p>\u201cIn a few minutes. Hey, this looks good.\u201d Jack made an effort to be enthusiastic. The last thing he wanted at the moment was a meal he didn\u2019t recognize. He wished he hadn\u2019t tried for a big impression and had just taken her to a local steak house, which would have been his preference. But right now he didn\u2019t give a damn about food, Japanese or otherwise. He wanted to follow Hannah, make her tell him what the problem was, comfort her, apologize, promise her anything, if he could just start over and this time not put his size-twelve caulked boot in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe have some sushi and California rolls for you. Also sunomono\u2014cold noodle salad with rice vinegar...\u201d Man, that sounded terrific, Jack thought glumly.</p><p>\u201cAnd fish\u2014yuan zuke.\u201d She beamed at him, but her dark eyes still looked worried.</p><p>\u201cThank you. My, er, my wife will be back soon. Some sake, too, please?\u201d</p><p>The server hurried off again.</p> <p>My wife. He liked the sound of it. My wife.</p><p>Jack shook his head and took a deep breath. He was dreaming\u2014again. He glanced over his shoulder. Hannah was coming back.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked as she took her seat across from him. Her eyes were bright and her cheeks were red. She\u2019d combed her hair and put on fresh lipstick.</p><p>\u201cFine. This looks delicious!\u201d She seemed determined to disregard their earlier conversation. Who was he to argue?</p><p>\u201cGreat. Sushi?\u201d He held the platter out to her and managed to manipulate his chopsticks well enough to unload two interesting-looking bite-size pieces of rice and something else onto her plate.</p><p>They both dipped and ate at the same time. Hannah chewed slowly. Jack wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d just eaten, but it was definitely raw. Fish? Shrimp?</p><p>She smiled slightly and swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s not cooked,\u201d she announced, frowning. Then after a few seconds she shrugged and reached for another piece. \u201cNot bad, though.\u201d</p><p>Jack had to agree. Whatever it was, it was tasty. He had the feeling that any meal he shared with her would be perfect.</p> <p>She drank a lot of the sake in the tiny stoneware cups provided. Jack stopped at one small cup, since he was driving. They didn\u2019t talk much after the rest of the meal arrived. He concentrated on handling his chopsticks and not slopping food all over himself. Hannah was quiet, which worried him. This date didn\u2019t seem to be going very well, and it had started out with such promise.</p><p>Finally Hannah seemed to come to some kind of decision. He had no idea what she\u2019d been mulling over; he was just relieved she wanted to talk to him again.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she began, with a big smile. Her eyes sparkled and Jack wasn\u2019t sure how much had to do with the sake she\u2019d drunk and how much had to do with his scintillating company. \u201cLet\u2019s start over. I am a librarian, I\u2019m not married, I like animals and I\u2019m not what you think I am. I don\u2019t want to talk about myself any more than that. Okay? Now, tell me everything about Jack Gamble.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t what he thought she was? What was that supposed to mean? What did she think he thought she was? Okay, he could play the game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a geologist. I grew up pretty much an orphan, mostly in Saskatchewan. My dad abandoned our family when I was just a baby. No memory of him. My mom died when I was eight. I have no siblings. I was raised mainly by relatives, including Ira Chesley. I studied hard, became a geologist then turned to prospecting. Now I\u2019m going to be a farmer. I\u2019ve dated plenty of women, but I\u2019ve never been serious about one\u2014\u201d he refrained from adding until now \u201c\u2014but I\u2019d like to get married soon. You know that. That\u2019s me. What do you think of this stuff?\u201d He held up a clump of bamboo shoots between his chopsticks.</p><p>She giggled. It suited her. \u201cI like it. I keep losing my veggies.\u201d Her earrings jangled as she leaned forward to peer into the bubbling cauldron of broth. Jack saw a piece of chicken drift by and lunged for it.</p><p>\u201cAha!\u201d He held it high, dangling and dripping over the table, and she laughed. Then he moved it toward her, and she opened her mouth to accept his offering. Jack felt his heart lurch against his breast-bone.</p><p>She giggled again, her cheeks red, swallowed, then dug into the pot and offered him something pale and steaming. He didn\u2019t even look at it. \u201cYou know what? I think that was octopus!\u201d she said, her eyes dancing.</p><p>He chewed slowly and swallowed. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Hannah\u2019s smile faded slightly and her green eyes glowed, and Jack made himself a solemn vow: Things were back on track, he had no idea how or why, but he wasn\u2019t screwing up again.</p><p>He\u2019d been right last Friday. Hannah Parrish was the woman for him.</p><p>HANNAH FELT DIZZY as she stood up to put on her wrap. She hoped it wasn\u2019t the raw fish. The entire meal had been unusual and delicious. Jack took her elbow after he paid the bill, and they went out into the cold dark night. She leaned against him. Jack Gamble. Warm, solid-feeling. Good-natured. Funny. The stars were bright and white overhead. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d He squeezed her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Not really,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cThat sake really warmed me up. Like hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not quite hot chocolate,\u201d he said with a wry smile.</p><p>She smiled too. She was happy exactly where she was\u2014right in this exact spot in the universe, after a wonderful meal, after a terrific time with a man she\u2019d never dreamed she\u2019d see again. Right here in High River, Alberta. It was a forty-minute drive to Glory but she didn\u2019t care if they had to walk back. And then? She\u2019d made up her mind that she was confessing everything when they got back to her apartment. If she wasn\u2019t such a coward, she\u2019d do it now.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d She stopped halfway to his pickup. He turned to her, an inquiring look on his face. \u201cKiss me, Jack!\u201d</p><p>She threw both arms around him, letting her wrap slide to the ground and offered him her face, eyes closed. The streetlight shining behind him made her squeeze her eyes tighter. She heard the low rumble of his laughter.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe! I\u2019d be glad to.\u201d She felt his mouth touch hers. Just as she\u2019d remembered! Her knees went weak, her legs wonky. Just like Friday on the doorstep of her sister\u2019s house. Hannah clung to him, putting heart and soul into this one sweet experience. After Jack took her home and she told him the truth... Well, that would be it. She could never face a man she\u2019d lied to the way she\u2019d lied since last Friday. Once, maybe. After all, it had been Halloween that first time. But there was no excuse for what she\u2019d done today\u2014this evening. No matter what Emily said.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby!\u201d Jack muttered into her hair. She felt his arms hard around her. \u201cYou\u2019re so special. You\u2019re such a warm wonderful sexy woman!\u201d</p><p>With a groan he kissed her again. Hannah\u2019s knees gave way and she clung to him, giggling helplessly. \u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, I slipped! Is it icy?\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed, too, and when she got her footing again, he picked up her wrap, draped it around her shoulders and, after one last kiss, helped her into the passenger side of the truck. He practically had to lift her up, the running board seemed so high. Higher than when she\u2019d gotten into it earlier, Hannah thought. Everything seemed so...so strange.</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nodded. \u201cJoan will be wondering where I am. And Mr. Spitz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Spitz, huh? Is this a man in your life I should know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Spitz is the cat.\u201d</p><p>She heard his chuckle and the hum of the engine as he started it. She felt very tired. It couldn\u2019t be that late\u2014no more than ten o\u2019clock. That was what happened when you lived the boring life she did. Bed by ten, up at seven, half an hour for breakfast, ten minutes to read the paper, a fifteen-minute walk to work, washing on Monday, shopping on Tuesday...</p><p>Hannah wasn\u2019t sure what they discussed on the way to Glory, but she vaguely recalled Jack talking about his prospecting days up north. Then he was gently shaking her awake. They were parked in front of her apartment.</p><p>She\u2019d fallen asleep in the truck! Just like some twelve-year-old being driven home from Grandma\u2019s house.</p><p>FOR A FEW MOMENTS Jack just gazed at the sleeping Hannah in the light from the street lamp. She was a mystery\u2014strong, sexy, but also vulnerable and innocent somehow. Her eyes shut, her lips slightly parted, the strap of her bag tucked into one relaxed hand. The long painted fingernails, the hammered silver earrings, the slinky shawl. It didn\u2019t add up, and yet, in some weird way, it did.</p><p>\u201cHannah?\u201d He hated to wake her. He would\u2019ve preferred to take her to his place\u2014well, not now, but when it was all fixed up\u2014and tuck her into bed beside him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His wife? He could see it. He\u2019d better not let anything like a marrriage proposal slip out of his big mouth. Not yet. Hannah was carrying around something that was bothering her. Maybe it had to do with this house-sitting gig. Maybe it had to do with being stuck in boring old Glory for her holidays. Hannah a farmer\u2019s wife? Could he be so lucky? Not likely. Jack felt cold shudders run through his body.</p><p>He clenched his jaw and touched her arm again. \u201cHannah? We\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome?\u201d She opened her eyes and stared deep into his soul. Then she sat up groggily and blinked.</p><p>\u201cHeavens. I must have fallen asleep. Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, Jack, you must think I\u2019m awful...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot awful, babe. Just tired, that\u2019s all. Come on, I\u2019ll take you in.\u201d</p><p>He walked around the truck to the passenger side. The big date was over. Then he had another twenty-minute drive out to his cold dark dingy farmhouse.</p><p>But not right away. She insisted he come inside for a coffee. That struck him as a pretty old-fashioned offer, but he realized she wasn\u2019t quite herself. He knew she\u2019d had quite a bit of sake to drink. Coffee was probably a good idea.</p><p>\u201cHiya, gorgeous!\u201d The parrot woke up, untucking its head from under its wing.</p><p>\u201cOh, Joan...\u201d Hannah tossed her wrap in the direction of a chair and missed, then walked toward the parrot and pulled a dark cloth down over the cage. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I forgot to cover you up.\u201d The parrot muttered sleepily\u2014Jack was sure he heard a soft \u201cblimey, fiddlesticks!\u201d\u2014and then was silent.</p> <p>Hannah seemed really distressed. Fidgety. Had it bothered her that much that she\u2019d forgotten to cover the bird? Or that she\u2019d fallen asleep in his truck? Sure, it wasn\u2019t the usual ending to a date, but then, so far everything about their relationship had been unusual, to say the least. Right from the start, when she\u2019d dropped the contents of her purse in the lobby of the St. Regis.</p><p>\u201cHow about I make the coffee?\u201d Jack suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou sit down and I\u2019ll be with you in a jiffy.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and began to rub her eyes, then quickly stopped and sat down on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said, looking up. \u201cJiffy. I haven\u2019t heard anyone say that in ages.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMust be a Saskatchewan word,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fridge.\u201d She looked disconsolate again; he hoped the coffee would help, but maybe that was expecting too much of caffeine.</p><p>\u201cListen, you feeling okay, Hannah?\u201d he ventured as the coffee machine began gurgling.</p><p>\u201cMe? Of...of course. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drank quite a lot of wine with dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not! I didn\u2019t even like it that much!\u201d She looked upset. As though he\u2019d accused her of something serious.</p><p>\u201cYou did, Hannah. I drank one cup and you drank the rest. Hey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d He held up both hands in mock surrender. \u201cHappens from time to time to the best of us.\u201d He ducked back into the kitchen to bring out a couple of mugs of coffee. Did she take cream or sugar? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p> <p>\u201cThis all right?\u201d He set the coffee down in front of her.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She hadn\u2019t even looked at it. She twisted the hem of the embroidered tunic she was wearing, one foot tucked up under her as she sat on the sofa. He wanted to sit down beside her, but he wasn\u2019t sure of her in this mood. It reminded him of the episode in the restaurant. He settled into an upholstered chair to one side of the sofa.</p><p>He was about to make some light remark, but thought better of it and raised the steaming coffee to his mouth. Yuck. One percent milk wasn\u2019t his idea of coffee cream.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she began, looking worriedly at him, \u201cI have something to tell you. Something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh?\u201d He gazed at her across the top of his mug. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Hannah? You\u2019re married? You\u2019re a drag queen? You deal drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious. I\u2019m...I\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d She seemed on the verge of bursting into tears. She still hadn\u2019t touched her coffee.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You said something like that in the restaurant. What do you mean? You\u2019re not Hannah Parrish?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cI am. I am Hannah Parrish,\u201d she said emphatically, nodding her head. \u201cI\u2019m just not what I seem to be. It\u2019s all a great big lie. I\u2019m not house-sitting. This is really my apartment, this is my parrot and that cat\u2019s my cat and...and all the stuff in here is mine. It\u2019s so hard to explain.\u201d</p><p>Jack stared at her. \u201cCome on, Hannah. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d She got up, then got down on her knees and peered under the skirt of the sofa. \u201cI can prove it. Watch this. Mr. Spitz?\u201d She looked earnestly up at Jack. Her eyes were overbright, yet distant. She\u2019d definitely had too much rice wine. Maybe she\u2019d been more nervous with him than he\u2019d realized; he should have kept an eye on her. But why was she talking like this? \u201cIt\u2019s my cat. He adores me. I rescued him from the pound. Watch. He-e-ere, Mr. Spitz!\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy thump in the vicinity of the dining room, and Jack turned around. The cat had leaped onto the dining-room table from the china cabinet. As he watched, the cat jumped onto a chair, then onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome, kitty!\u201d Hannah called. \u201cLapsies!\u201d She patted her lap enticingly from her position back on the sofa.</p><p>The cat didn\u2019t even glance at her. With its tail held high, it walked directly away from her into the hallway and turned into an open doorway, probably a bedroom, and disappeared.</p><p>Jack took another gulp of his coffee and scorched his tongue. No way was he checking out Hannah\u2019s reaction to the cat\u2019s defection.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never done that before,\u201d she muttered, sounding bewildered. Jack wanted to laugh. He also wanted to go over and pull her into his arms and tell her that he didn\u2019t care who she thought she was or what was going on, that he liked her just the way she was.</p><p>\u201cHey, it doesn\u2019t matter. Drink your coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my place.\u201d She waved one arm around.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your friend, Jasmine Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no Jasmine Kelly. I made it all up!\u201d She twisted her hands again in the tunic hem. \u201cI did! Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Jack drained his coffee and stood. \u201cI think you\u2019re a little mixed-up. You had a bit too much sake tonight and maybe it didn\u2019t agree with you. And you fell asleep in my truck. You\u2019re disoriented\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jack! Look here, these aren\u2019t my clothes!\u201d To his dismay, she started removing her earrings and plucking at the tunic. \u201cThis is my sister\u2019s top. These are her friend\u2019s earrings. This isn\u2019t even my hair!\u201d She grabbed a handful of her hair. \u201cRed! I don\u2019t have red hair, I have ordinary mousy-brown hair.\u201d</p><p>Her hair looked red to him. Jack reached for her hand and patted it gently. \u201cCome on, honey. I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re changed and ready for bed, then I\u2019ll turn out all the lights and make sure your door is locked. You get a good night\u2019s sleep, you\u2019ll feel a hundred percent better in the morning. Promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine! There\u2019s nothing wrong with me! You\u2019re patronizing me! Why don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t you talking, Hannah. This is preposterous. You do have red hair,\u201d he explained patiently, raising his hand to finger a lock of her glorious hair. \u201cAnd why would you make up all that stuff about house-sitting? Why would your sister? Come on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m telling you the truth! This person you think is me isn\u2019t me at all.\u201d Her eyes were wide. He wanted nothing more than to kiss this crazy, wonderful woman. Put her mind on a different track altogether.</p><p>She suddenly threw the silver earrings across the room. One bounced off the parrot\u2019s cage and brought a squawk of protest from the snoozing bird. \u201cThese aren\u2019t mine!\u201d She looked furious. She started to pull off the tunic and Jack whirled around so that his back was to her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Settle down here, Hannah. Don\u2019t get undressed. Please. We hardly know each other. Down the hall and into your bedroom. That\u2019s a good girl.\u201d He flinched as he heard her stalk down the hallway, tossing a decidedly unladylike epithet over her shoulder.</p><p>A door slammed. Jack waited ten minutes. There was no further sound from her bedroom. Finally he decided he\u2019d better check on her, make sure she was okay. She was asleep in her bed, a handmade old-fashioned quilt tucked up under her chin. He could see the sleeves of a rose-sprigged cotton nightgown, decidedly a Jasmine Kelly touch. Her Hannah Parrish clothes were puddled in the middle of the floor. Jack paused, then quickly bent and placed a chaste kiss on her cheek. Jasmine? Hannah? It was time for him to go.</p><p>\u201cSweet dreams, princess,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwhoever you are.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>HANNAH AWOKE to the sound of her telephone ringing and the bright light of midmorning streaming through her uncurtained windows. She never went to bed without closing the curtains.</p><p>She made her way to the bathroom, the events of the previous evening slowly dropping into place in her horrified mind. She flicked on the bathroom light and screamed. Whatever was on her face fell to the floor, and she hopped back, trying to balance on one foot, any foot, so long as it wasn\u2019t near the thing.</p><p>One-half of a set of false eyelashes lay harmlessly at her feet. Hannah sank onto the side of the bathtub, torn between relief and hysterical laughter. What was happening to her? She\u2019d tried to tell Jack about the stupid trick she and Emily had played on him, and he hadn\u2019t believed a word. She\u2019d gone to bed without cleansing her face and still wearing false eyelashes! One had come off in the night and attacked her\u2014 Hannah began to giggle. Thank heavens Jack hadn\u2019t spent the night. She could just see herself waking up beside him, all love-dazed and with big black eyelashes stuck to her cheek. He\u2019d leap out of bed and start running and never stop.</p><p>Maybe that was what he was doing this morning. Running. She couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>All the laughter drizzled to a stop inside her. She\u2019d blown it. She\u2019d blown it big time. First she\u2019d gone and drunk too much wine\u2014no, first she\u2019d gone along with Emily\u2019s crazy idea. But how could she blame her sister? All she\u2019d had to do was say no. The truth was, she\u2019d wanted desperately to see Jack again. The truth was she\u2019d hoped against hope that something would happen\u2014something\u2014that would make things all right again. It hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d tried to explain the deception to him, and he had flat out not believed her. He thought she was being silly, making it up, for who-knew-what reason. That she\u2019d drunk too much sake. He still thought she was cool, sophisticated, sexy Hannah Parrish. Sophisticated, sure\u2014he should have heard her screaming at the \u201cspider\u201d on the bathroom floor.</p><p>Hannah washed her face and removed the false lashes from her other eye, dropping both into the trash. End of that. She stepped into the shower and vigorously shampooed her hair. Then, when she\u2019d rinsed, she shampooed again. How many times was that? She\u2019d lost count, but at least the red was fading noticeably. She felt sick every time she thought about what she\u2019d done. It was so unlike her; she\u2019d never done anything so deliberately false in her life. Even if he\u2019d believed her last night, would he have forgiven her? Honest as the day is long, he\u2019d said. That was what he wanted in a woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A simple trick designed to amuse her sister Emily had turned into something that was affecting her entire life. That wasn\u2019t an exaggeration; she liked Jack. More than liked him. She really thought they might have had a chance together\u2014</p><p>Then Hannah froze, suds running down her shocked face. It was worse....</p><p>He\u2019d told her he wanted to marry someone like Jasmine Kelly, the friend she was supposedly house-sitting for. She\u2019d told him there was no friend, that she was the one who lived in the apartment! Hannah moaned and turned off the water. He must think she was trying to pretend there was no Jasmine Kelly because she\u2014Hannah\u2014was interested in him. He must think she was so desperate, so shameless, so needy, that she\u2019d make up anything, be anything, do anything, to impress a man. To impress Jack Gamble. He was running, all right. As far and as fast as he could. Wouldn\u2019t she do the same if she was in his position?</p><p>Hannah stumbled back into the hall and into her bedroom. She heard Joan squawk and the phone trill again, but she ignored both. She flopped onto her bed and covered her face with the pillow.</p> <p>And she\u2019d thought things were bad before!</p><p>The phone rang a third time and Hannah still ignored it. If it was Emily, she didn\u2019t want to talk to her; if it was Jack, she didn\u2019t want to talk to him. She didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone but Joan and maybe Mrs. Putty. Even Mr. Spitz had better stay out of her way today.</p><p>HANNAH SPENT the next two days working hard on the presentation she wanted to make at the Wednesday-evening open meeting in the municipal-council chambers. Once a month the town council held casual sessions where the public could speak on issues of interest without having to go on a formal agenda. Hannah intended to ask for a stay of proceedings against the order to move Seth Wilbee. She hoped the town would simply forget the whole issue, but barring that, she wanted them to let Seth stay until spring, when he could possibly find a new location. Or have the time to build another shack.</p><p>On Monday she packed up all the clothing and jewelry Emily had so thoughtfully collected for her and took it back to Calgary to dump on her doorstep. If Emily had been home, Hannah would have relented and pushed the doorbell to say hello. She missed her sister and usually talked to her at least once a week. Their parents were retired and always traveling; the latest letter Hannah had received had been postmarked somewhere in Africa. Namibia? Nigeria? But luckily she knew Emily was at work. Hannah had no desire to be grilled about Jack, and she knew Emily would do more than grill her. She\u2019d roast her if she knew the latest!</p><p>Then Hannah drove to the Southcentre Mall to check out a teaching-supply store that her friend Ella Searle had recommended. She was looking for literacy material. Seth Wilbee was going to learn to read his own mail before the winter was through, or her name wasn\u2019t Hannah Parrish.</p> <p>\u201cELK, YOU SAY?\u201d There was silence of nearly a minute as the old man in the hospital recliner chair considered Jack\u2019s proposal. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to check with the town, son. Maybe they\u2019d put in a plug for you with the Ag Department. Venture like that takes money. Big money. I got some you can use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, Uncle Ira. I\u2019ve got money,\u201d Jack said, patting his uncle\u2019s liver-spotted hand. The old man looked so frail it was hard to imagine him farming all by himself these last years, out in all kinds of weather.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Angus Tump is keeping an eye on them. I told you that. He comes in around suppertime just to make sure everything\u2019s okay.\u201d Ira\u2019s ragtag collection of no-good hounds was his pride and joy. Every time Jack visited, Ira asked about the dogs.</p><p>\u201cAngus, eh? He\u2019s a good man\u2014he\u2019ll take care of them all right,\u201d the old man murmured. He glanced at the wall clock. Was it his suppertime? Was he anxious for Jack to leave already?</p><p>\u201cHow about you? What does the doc say?\u201d Jack was trying to be cheerful. He was shocked at how much feebler Ira seemed, even in the week since he\u2019d seen him.</p> <p>\u201cElk, eh?\u201d The old bachelor repeated, ignoring Jack\u2019s query about his health. Ira definitely seemed taken with the notion of Jack\u2019s raising elk or deer. The wild-boar idea had never been a serious one, despite what Jack had told Hannah. \u201cThey take real good care of me here, boy. I got company. Decent grub couple times a day served up. I was only\u2014\u201d his pale eyes wandered toward Jack\u2019s \u201c\u2014I was only worried about the dogs, y\u2019see?\u201d</p><p>The man in the next bed had the television on, and Jack noticed that his uncle\u2019s attention kept drifting to the screen. An infomercial\u2014someone demonstrating a food dehydrator or something equally useful. Time to leave. He stood.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll check in on you after I hear back from the fellow in Regina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d His uncle\u2019s gaze wandered to Jack again. He seemed suddenly agitated. He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cListen. You get yourself married, y\u2019hear? You get yourself a wife, now you got a farm and some prospects. Don\u2019t...don\u2019t make the mistake I did. Don\u2019t delay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat mistake, Uncle Ira?\u201d This was the first Jack had heard about any woman in Ira Chesley\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to marry Gladys Petrie, my sister\u2019s friend. Gladys was sweet on me, too. I had plans back then. Big plans. I went out to Alberta and got the farm going and one thing and another, and by the time I went back to fetch Gladys, back in Maple Creek, it was too late. She\u2019d married someone else. She got tired of waiting.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t know what to say. He was astounded at his uncle\u2019s story. Poor old duff! Jack reached for his hand. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about me, Uncle Ira. I\u2019ve got my eye on someone right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thinking. Don\u2019t delay, son!\u201d The old man squeezed his fingers. He still had considerable strength in his hands, despite the apparent frailty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t delay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Jack said, mainly to placate him. \u201cI\u2019ll stop in and see you next week, all right?\u201d Jack shrugged on his coat and smiled at a pretty nurse who came by to pick up his uncle\u2019s chart. When he looked at the old man, he was surprised to see him wink.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got nice scenery in here, eh?\u201d He winked again and gave Jack a faint smile. \u201cTV\u2019s good, too. Lots of channels.\u201d His uncle watched him go toward the door. He was already glancing back at the infomercial before Jack had left the room.</p><p>Get married. Check with the town. Buy groceries. Call Ira\u2019s doctor. Hire a painter. Pay Angus Tump. Call Hannah again. Why wasn\u2019t she answering her phone? Call the elk fellow in Regina. Check on the price of fencing. Get a haircut? Nope. Too soon.</p><p>Get married.</p><p>Now why did that particular item keep jumping to the top of his list?</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>THE MUNICIPAL CHAMBERS were packed. Hannah was surprised, but when she spoke to a few people, she realized two pressing issues accounted for the turnout: the selection of a town animal\u2014most favored the gopher, but a small contingent insisted on calling the creature Richardson\u2019s ground squirrel, which infuriated the gopher supporters; and the theme for this year\u2019s Main Street Christmas display. The aging angels and stars used for a decade had finally been retired, and the town planned to acquire new streetlight and banner decorations.</p><p>Seth Wilbee wasn\u2019t there. He\u2019d blanched when Hannah told him what she\u2019d planned on his behalf and asked him to accompany her to the municipal hall. He didn\u2019t care for crowds, he said; they made him sweat. Hannah didn\u2019t press him. She hoped to be able to bring him good news after the meeting, and that would be the end of it.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard from Jack. He\u2019d left a dozen messages the first two days, when she wasn\u2019t answering her phone or her door. But then today and yesterday, when she\u2019d decided that she couldn\u2019t hide anymore, that she had to face up to the consequences of her foolishness, no matter how humiliating, there\u2019d been nothing. Was he out of town? There was always the possibility that he\u2019d decided she was seriously unbalanced, pretending to be Jasmine Kelly. Maybe he was counting his lucky stars.</p><p>The meeting started at a ridiculous time, half-past four. It was getting dark early these days, and the first snowfall in Glory\u2014the first to stay, at least\u2014had made the sidewalks slippery and dusted the landscape with white. It was a lovely time of year, though, Hannah\u2019s favorite: not too cold, yet brisk and dry. Perfect pre-Christmas weather. In the library the students were still enthusiastic about their projects, and she enjoyed helping them find what they were looking for, introducing them to the world of research and books.</p><p>Hannah walked to the municipal hall alone. She\u2019d put a pot roast in a slow oven before she left the apartment and had fed Mr. Spitz and Joan early. She had no idea how long the meeting would go on, or if she\u2019d even have a chance to speak. She wore her new snowboots with the zip-up fronts and her woolly tights, along with a corduroy skirt and a fleecy Icelandic sweater she\u2019d knit several years before in one of her knitting phases. She\u2019d knitted one for Emily, too, in blue and gray tones, and given it to her for Christmas that year. Over it all, she wore her navy wool pea coat and a red tam. The color in her hair had finally departed and she was back to her usual brown. Everything felt good about the change. Her only regret was that while she\u2019d been playing the glamorous Hannah Parrish, she\u2019d met a man she knew she could really care about\u2014already did, impossible as it seemed\u2014and had blown her opportunity by trying to deceive him further. All because she was scared to death he wouldn\u2019t like her as she really was. Which, in a way was true, no matter what he said about the \u201cfriend\u201d she was house-sitting for. After all, he\u2019d been attracted to her\u2014Hannah\u2014precisely because she appeared to be a glitzy glamour girl, hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>Hannah sighed. Life wasn\u2019t fair. But then, she\u2019d never really expected it to be. She stopped at Seth\u2019s mailbox to pop in the beginner\u2019s workbook she\u2019d bought at the teaching-store in Calgary. The first task was learning the alphabet. When Seth had finished with that workbook, Hannah had a stack of others. She was looking forward to the project; it took her mind off her own problems a little. The trouble was, she had too much time on her hands. She supposed that once she got back to work next week, she\u2019d be fine.</p><p>Hannah recognized a lot of Glory townfolk in the crowd. She waved to Myra Schultz, the postmistress, and Honor Gallant, who was there with her sister-in-law, Nan. Ben Longquist, Nan\u2019s son, sat beside them, very handsome and grown-up these days. Hannah thought he must be in his early twenties now; he was attending university somewhere, she\u2019d heard. She spotted a friend of Mrs. Putty\u2019s and waved. Mrs. Vandenbroek was an elderly widow who\u2019d come to the community from Holland after the war and had settled in a big house on Alder Street, where she rented her upstairs flat to tenants.</p><p>The clerk called the buzzing crowd to order. The first item regarded the selection of a town animal. The nearby town of Tamarack had recently chosen the mountain lion, to the chagrin of some Glory folk who felt a gopher would be too unimpressive in comparison. But the sentiment seemed to be generally in favor of the lively prairie rodent that had once populated bustling gopher \u201ctowns\u201d of interlinked burrows in the prairie sod. These days, after decades of poisoning and trapping, the animal was rarely seen outside of such safe areas as the busy gopher settlement on the grounds of the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology at Drumheller. Glory had a long-established gopher population in the riverside park, thus the support for electing it town animal. Still, it was true: the actual name of what had always been called a gopher was Richardson\u2019s ground squirrel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho the heck\u2019s this Richardson, anyway?\u201d complained one member of the public. \u201cEverybody knows a gopher\u2019s a gopher!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I may speak to that, Your Worship,\u201d began a small bespectacled man wearing a vest and striped tie, addressing the mayor. This was Norman Weber, who worked at the liquor store. He nervously pushed back his glasses and referred to a piece of paper in his hand. \u201cThe true and proper name for what is popularly known as a gopher is Richardson\u2019s ground squirrel,\u201d he read. He looked at the mayor. \u201cNow, do we want the town of Glory to be a laughingstock because we don\u2019t call our town animal by its proper name?\u201d</p><p>The poor man was drowned out by a chorus of \u201cAw, sit down\u201d and \u201cWho cares?\u201d Hannah tried not to smile; a lot of people took this very seriously. Clearly, the gopher people were in the majority. No way she was suggesting spermophilii richardsonii, the Latin name, just to be really accurate!</p><p>The debate continued, with the clerk finally calling a halt to discussion and opening the floor to suggestions about the festive season\u2019s street decorations. The next half hour was spent arguing the merits of Santas and reindeers over candy canes and snowmen. By six she wondered if she\u2019d have a chance to speak at all. Usually these meetings were fairly short. A little later, though, the call came from the town clerk, \u201cAny more business?\u201d and she put up her hand.</p> <p>\u201cHannah Parrish!\u201d</p><p>She left her coat and purse at her seat and walked to the end of the aisle so she could speak into the microphone. She pulled her sweater down neatly and cleared her throat. To her great embarrassment, she heard a wolf whistle from the corner of the room, where a group of skateboarders had taken seats. A general chuckle followed. The teens, according to the man next to her, were there to ask the town for a skateboard park in the new riverside development.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to speak on behalf of Seth Wilbee, who, as many of you know, has a small dwelling on the riverbank in the vicinity of the proposed park.\u201d There was a murmur from the crowd. Hannah didn\u2019t know whether to be encouraged by that or not. Seth Wilbee was tolerated in the community, but he wasn\u2019t claimed as a friend by anyone she knew. She was sure town children were just as wary of the loner who lived in the riverbank shack as she had been of Mrs. Birch, the \u201cold witch\u201d of her own childhood.</p><p>Hannah continued, relating how she\u2019d visited him and discovered he\u2019d been ordered to move his shack immediately. She had decided right from the start to keep Seth\u2019s secret but pointed out to the mayor and councillors that since construction wouldn\u2019t start until spring, perhaps Mr. Wilbee could be given an extension on the order, so he\u2019d have more time to find a suitable dwelling place.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like a cave!\u201d shouted someone.</p> <p>\u201cOr a barrel!\u201d shouted another. Some chuckled and others booed the speakers.</p><p>The mayor, the butcher from the IGA, asked the council if there were any serious objections to giving Mr. Wilbee an extension. No one had any objections, although one councillor, a real-estate agent, stood and lectured the crowd on the dangers of \u201cindigents, mendicants and dilettantes\u201d taking over the streets of Glory. No one was quite sure what he meant, but Hannah did not think it augured well for the young and generally unpopular skateboard crowd.</p><p>\u201cRuth Putty!\u201d the town clerk called out. Hannah was surprised. She hadn\u2019t known her neighbor was there.</p><p>The plump elderly woman made her way to the microphone, and took it from Hannah. Mrs. Putty was very red and out of breath.</p><p>\u201cI just want to say that although I wish Seth Wilbee would go into a home where he\u2019d be off our streets and well looked after, I know he won\u2019t because he\u2019s too darn stubborn.\u201d The crowd murmured in agreement. \u201cBut I want to put in a word here for my neighbor, Hannah Parrish. We live in the same apartment building, and I\u2019ve known Hannah for several years. She\u2019s a dear young thing, a real asset at our town library and a wonderful friend to me. I know she keeps an eye on Seth and even takes the old fool homemade cookies and such.\u201d The crowd laughed.</p><p>\u201cNow she\u2019s going to bat for him against the town and even teaching him to read! How about that? I think we should have a round of applause for our librarian, Miss Hannah Parrish. She\u2019s a fine example to all our young people!\u201d Mrs. Putty glared in the direction of the skateboarders, who sent up a good-tempered jeer.</p> <p>The crowd burst into applause, much to Hannah\u2019s dismay. Mrs. Putty grabbed her and kissed her cheek, then went huffing and puffing back to her seat. Hannah followed, blushing. Just before she sat down, she glanced behind her, smiling at her many applauding supporters. Then she froze.</p><p>Staring at her from the back of the room was one person she\u2019d never thought she\u2019d see in this room. It was Jack Gamble, dressed in jeans and a wind-breaker, and he looked as shocked and surprised as she was.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>JACK WAS WAITING for her on the steps of her apartment building when Hannah arrived home. It had started to snow again, and she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d have noticed him right away. But a quick rap on the window above the doorway, the living-room window belonging to Mrs. Putty, left no doubt in her mind. When she looked up, Mrs. Putty made violent gestures pointing down, toward the door. Evidently she\u2019d seen Jack and wanted to make sure Hannah didn\u2019t miss him.</p><p>How could she miss him? He looked as wonderful as ever\u2014no, even more so\u2014dressed in casual working clothes. She glanced down the street and noticed his pickup parked down the block a little, out of the loading zone. He watched her approach, making no move to come toward her.</p><p>She felt self-conscious. But then she lifted her chin and met his gaze straight on. She liked who she was. She\u2019d always liked who she was\u2014plain Hannah Parrish. She decided to ignore him. After all, she had no idea why he was here. Why hadn\u2019t he acknowledged her at the town hall? She\u2019d looked for him in the crowd as the meeting broke up, but he\u2019d left. Then she\u2019d been delayed talking to various people, and after that, had decided to stop at Seth\u2019s place to tell him it seemed very likely the town would give him a reprieve. Seth\u2019s pale eyes had watered dangerously, and he\u2019d held her gloved hands in his large gnarled ones and thanked her again and again. She\u2019d noticed the open workbook on his wooden table, with a coal-oil lantern burning over it. The dotted lines of a\u2019s were already traced in pencil.</p><p>Hannah clutched her purse and the bag Seth had given her more tightly as she saw Jack step out from under the portico and move toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d he asked, his voice warm.</p> <p>They were under the streetlight, well within Mrs. Putty\u2019s view. Hannah looked stubbornly up at him, her lips pressed firmly together. She decided to ignore his question. \u201cI saw you at the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jack moved a little closer and smiled at her. \u201cHannah Parrish, isn\u2019t it? The town librarian? This is where she lives and her neighbor\u2019s name is Ruth Putty and she\u2019s known her for several years?\u201d</p><p>Hannah knew her cheeks were a furious red. Mrs. Putty had set the facts out very clearly at the meeting, and Jack hadn\u2019t missed a thing. She nodded. She didn\u2019t quite trust her voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd Hannah Parrish has a parrot named Joan and a very independent cat called Mr. Spitz?\u201d he went on, one eyebrow raised, a slight smile on his face.</p><p>Hannah nodded and dug in her pocket for her key. She was feeling a little better. At least Jack wasn\u2019t angry. He touched her arm and she turned to him.</p><p>\u201cHannah!\u201d He framed her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cForgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d she asked, her breath painful in her lungs.</p><p>\u201cFor not believing you. When you tried to tell me the truth.\u201d He bent down and brushed her lips with his and Hannah felt her knees jiggle. He always had this effect on her!</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t say I blame you, Jack,\u201d she replied quietly. Even thinking of it now, her foolish deception made her voice quaver and her eyes burn. \u201cIt was all so stupid. I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t begin to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily told me,\u201d he broke in. \u201cShe told me the whole story. When you didn\u2019t answer your phone, I nearly went mad. You didn\u2019t answer your door. I thought something had happened to you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack!\u201d Hannah dropped her purse and the paper bag Seth had given her. \u201cKiss me!\u201d</p><p>Jack did, with enthusiasm. Hannah gave herself up to his embrace. This was where she belonged. Oh, thank you, Emily, thank you.</p><p>\u201cHannah, honey,\u201d Jack murmured, his face against her tam. \u201cIs it too early in our relationship to say that I really, really like you? Exactly the way you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hannah said, smiling into his jacket. She realized her face was wet with tears, tears of joy. Mrs. Putty was certainly getting an eyeful.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d He held her away from him so he could look at her. \u201cI really, really like you, Hannah Parrish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I really, really like you, Jack. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I wanted to hear that.\u201d He held her tighter and dropped a kiss on her nose. He pulled off her tam and buried his face in her hair. She heard his muffled laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d She barely trusted her voice.</p><p>\u201cYour hair. It\u2019s a glorious brown. And it\u2019s so curly.\u201d He smiled down at her, twisting one tendril of her hair around his finger. \u201cDid I ever tell you I\u2019m very partial to brunettes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack!\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed her again. Hannah opened her eyes to see her neighbor give her a thumbs-up before drawing her curtains\u2014rather reluctantly, Hannah thought with a smile.</p><p>\u201cHave you had supper?\u201d she asked when she caught her breath.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a huge grin. \u201cAre you inviting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said. She wondered if she looked as giddy as she felt. Another chance with Jack!</p><p>\u201cLet me guess what you\u2019re serving. Meat loaf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cBaked ham, noodles and string beans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cBut you do have something in the oven, right? For after the meeting. Because you\u2019re an organized, careful, domestic kind of person, right? Not to mention sexy as all get-out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, eyes dancing. \u201cGive up?\u201d</p><p>He took her key and opened the front door of her building. \u201cLast guess\u2014pot roast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah Parrish, you are the woman of my dreams.\u201d He held the door for her. \u201cWould you consider this too early for me to mention the possibility of you becoming a farmer\u2019s wife someday?\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart melt all over again. \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby!\u201d Jack swooped her into his arms and kissed her again. Hannah was glad they were out of sight of her interested neighbor.</p><p>\u201cAlthough, I have to admit,\u201d Hannah managed, her heart beating furiously, \u201cit would depend a lot on who the farmer was.\u201d</p><p>Jack let out a whoop of laughter and released her, and Hannah glanced down at the stuff she\u2019d dropped. He bent and picked up her purse and the paper bag, brushing off the snow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just some vegetables Seth gave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurnips?

You won\u2019t find it on a map, but it\u2019s out there in Central Oregon, a once old-fashioned town surrounded by high desert ranching country. These past ten years, Elk Springs has been transformed by a new ski resort on Juanita Butte outside town.</p><p>New and old met when Scott McNeil, a man who helped build that ski resort, married Meg Patton, who was born and grew up in Elk Springs, then brought her son back to raise him in her hometown. You\u2019re about to meet Scott\u2019s brother, by the way. Kevin McNeil has come to Elk Springs to live and work\u2014although his restless nature has him assuming he won\u2019t stay.</p><p>Oh, while you\u2019re in town, stick your head in the new public safety building that houses the police department. If anything epitomizes change in this community, it\u2019s the Elk Springs P.D., run for a quarter century by hard-nosed Chief Ed Patton, who didn\u2019t know the meaning of mercy. Longtime residents are pretty sure he\u2019s rolling over in his grave now that a woman, his own daughter, Renee Patton, wears the badge! Those same residents will tell you that, along with her two sisters\u2014both also in law enforcement\u2014Renee does a fine job of keeping the peace in Elk Springs.</p><p>So enjoy your visit and come again.</p><p>Janice Kay Johnson</p><p>Other Elk Springs books by Janice Kay Johnson</p> <p>HARLEQUIN SUPERROMANCE</p><p>854\u2014THE WOMAN IN BLUE</p><p>860\u2014THE BABY AND THE BADGE</p><p>866\u2014A MESSAGE FOR ABBY</p><p>913\u2014JACK MURRAY, SHERIFF</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>THE CANNON BOOMED, white smoke puffing from its mouth. Blue-coated Yankee cavalry cantered through the forest, flashes of gleaming chestnut coat or gold braid glinting between branches. Closer, on the grassy hillside, Rebel and Yankee infantrymen maneuvered, making forays and being driven back by the sharp crack of rifle fire. Wounded fell as the watching crowd gasped. Bodies littered the landscape.</p><p>His stern gaze fixed on the hillside skirmish, a Confederate colonel strode past the split-rail fence where Melanie Parker leaned. His gray frock coat had a curved breast with two seven-button rows and elaborate gold braid on the sleeves and trim on collar and cuffs. Blue trim ran up his trouser legs. His graying head was covered by an officer\u2019s kepi, a kind of slouch cap.</p><p>Melanie watched his progress with pardonable pride. She had made his uniform, from inner pockets to decorative braid. In fact, half the uniforms on this field had come from her sewing machine.</p><p>The Civil War reenactors were a passionate bunch, she\u2019d discovered. Every tiny detail had to be right, for these men and women were out here to educate, as well as have fun. She had become something of an expert on Rebel and Yankee uniforms both, from the pullover white muslin shirt with removable collar to the Confederate rank insignia on the coat sleeves. She\u2019d sewed many of the gowns worn by camp followers, too. Melanie had something of an obsession herself for historical accuracy.</p><p>Today\u2019s reenactment of an obscure battle was being staged primarily for children. Scouting troops from all over central Oregon, both boys and girls, had gathered in the state park outside Elk Springs to watch, learn and participate. Melanie was here as leader of her daughter Angie\u2019s troop.</p><p>Except for a few stolen moments of pleasure taken in her handiwork, she was too busy keeping tabs on the girls to follow the strategy on the battlefield. Somebody always had to go to the portable toilets a quarter of a mile away. The booths selling 1860s-era keepsakes, clothing and candy enticed eight-year-old girls with allowance money tucked in their pockets. Melanie had spent the entire day thinking, Now, where is Jennifer? Oh. Good. Well, then, what about Rainy? And Sarah. She\u2019s missing, too, isn\u2019t she? Melanie did not envy the troop leaders with younger children.</p><p>A buzz passed through the crowd, a ripple she scarcely noticed as she counted noses for the four hundred and eighty-eighth time.</p><p>\u201cMelanie.\u201d A regional Scout leader paused, her expression harassed and even a little anxious. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen a wandering four-year-old, have you? A boy in green corduroy overalls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Melanie waved a hand and raised her voice. \u201cAngie and Rachel, where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d She switched her attention back to the leader. \u201cIs this kid really lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody has seen him in the past hour. Or more.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHis dad has a group of older boys.\u201d She nodded vaguely toward the encampment. \u201cHe thought his son was with his wife, she thought he was with the dad. You know how that goes.\u201d</p><p>No, actually, Melanie didn\u2019t. Angie\u2019s dad had never been interested in taking her places. In fact, she hadn\u2019t even seen him in almost two years.</p><p>But Melanie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>No small boy in green overalls darted through the crowd or tried to duck under the split-rail fence to join the battle. Eventually Melanie and other Scout leaders organized their kids to hunt through the crowd and down by the lake.</p><p>The battle on the hillside dwindled in spirit, and the wounded rose to fight another day. Cavalry officers hunted through the fringe of the woods for the child.</p><p>Somebody pointed out the boy\u2019s mother, who raced along the riverbank, calling his name frantically, voice rising to a near scream. \u201cBrandon! Brandon, come to Mommy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to send the kids home,\u201d a senior Boy Scout leader decided, and the others concurred. Melanie corralled her girls by her Bronco, but Sarah\u2019s mother hurried across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you in the volunteer search-and-rescue group? Let me take the girls. You might be needed here. Angie can come home with Sarah.\u201d</p><p>As they piled into the Dodge Caravan, Melanie counted noses one last time and then hugged her daughter and thanked Sarah\u2019s mother. \u201cYou\u2019ll see that they all get home? Bless you. I\u2019ll hope I\u2019m not needed in the end.\u201d</p><p>An ardent hiker, she had joined the search-and-rescue group this past summer and had only been called out once, when a hiker got separated from his party in the Deschutes National Forest. His cell phone saved the day, which had taken some of the romance out of the rescue of a man with a sprained ankle, in Melanie\u2019s private opinion.</p><p>As the group gathered, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re sure this little boy wasn\u2019t...well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaken?\u201d the ranger who headed the group finished for her, his jaw set grimly. \u201cNo. We can\u2019t be. But there was virtually no automobile traffic out of here in the past few hours. Remember, pretty much the whole audience was Scout troops. Unless we have some sicko leader who dragged the kid off...\u201d</p><p>Nobody wanted to think about that.</p><p>\u201cThe kid is a wanderer, apparently. Couple months ago, he got up before his parents one morning and set off down the street. They found him a mile away. So that\u2019s the likeliest possibility.\u201d He looked around. \u201cOther questions? No? Okay. Tom, you take your group and do a sweep along the riverbank.\u201d He continued to give orders, and groups of eight or ten split off to follow them.</p><p>Melanie had become aware of a man she didn\u2019t know standing quietly nearby. He stood out from the crowd by virtue of his height, his lean powerful body and short-cropped but noticeably wavy auburn hair. In the late-afternoon sunlight, that hair was almost as red as the sweat-slick neck of the bay mare hitched to the nearby fence.</p><p>\u201cKevin, you handle the woods beyond the concession area. Go several miles, the kid has been missing for almost three hours now, but keep it slow. His mother says this is nap time, and he may have found a place to curl up.\u201d</p><p>The big auburn-haired man in jeans and dusty hiking boots said in a deep easy voice, \u201cYou got it. Okay.\u201d Clear gray eyes met Melanie\u2019s for an oddly startling moment before moving on. \u201cYou eight\u2014no, nine, are with me.\u201d</p><p>As they hurried across the beaten-down grass that had formed the parking lot, he gave orders: Fan out, but stay within sight and shouting distance of one another. He took the center himself. Melanie had the impression no one else knew him, either, but his air of command was so natural no one argued. Somehow, as they entered the ponderosa pines, Melanie found herself beside him.</p><p>The woods weren\u2019t dense, nothing like the Pacific Northwest coastal forests or the Florida Everglades. Here, reddish dust rose in tiny puffs with each footfall, and the scent of pine was sharp. If the ground had been level, finding one little boy would have been easy. As it was, however, the hill rising steeply from the Deschutes River was cut by narrow ravines with trickles of water that, in spring and early summer, would have been torrents. Every dip of ground had to be investigated, every clump of madrona or even long grass. Thank goodness this was late September and not August, when the heat would have had all of them dripping with sweat.</p><p>Melanie heaved herself up a clump of crumbling aged lava. Why couldn\u2019t Brandon Marsh have been wearing red or even royal blue? Why green?</p><p>A big tanned hand was suddenly right under her nose. She blinked and looked up into those unnerving gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you,\u201d she said breathlessly, and let his hand engulf hers. Kevin, whose last name she didn\u2019t know, hoisted her up the last rise. Discombobulated by sensations she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time\u2014the skitter of nerves in her palm, the warmth that traveled easily up her arm and down to her belly\u2014she stumbled and bumped into him.</p><p>He was every bit as solid as he looked.</p><p>She jumped back and teetered on the brink. Steadying herself, Melanie mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. If I\u2019d known what I was going to be doing today, I\u2019d have worn my boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shoes look sturdy.\u201d He still held her hand, as though he didn\u2019t trust her not to tumble back the way she\u2019d come.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine why.</p><p>\u201cI almost wore canvas slip-ons,\u201d she admitted. As if he would care.</p><p>A smile touched his sexy mouth. \u201cWe haven\u2019t met. I\u2019m Kevin McNeil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelanie Parker. I had a troop of girls here today. My daughter\u2019s troop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He let go of her hand. After a small silence he asked, sounding overly casual, \u201cWas your husband here to take her home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm? Oh, I don\u2019t have...\u201d Could it be? Was he hoping she didn\u2019t have a husband? \u201cI mean, I\u2019m divorced. One of the other mothers took charge of the girls.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made a pleased sound that sent a pleasant frisson tiptoeing up her spine. \u201cWell, Melanie, we\u2019d better keep moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a four-year-old boy climbed up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, either.\u201d A grimace tugged his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis kid sounds like an adventurer, though. Let\u2019s hope...\u201d</p> <p>She knew what he hoped: that four-year-old Brandon had ventured into the woods and not onto a slippery rock in the river. She was glad not to be in the group that had followed the Deschutes downstream.</p><p>He headed toward a giant fallen ponderosa riddled with insect holes, Melanie toward a lava outcrop. No small boy snoozed in a cranny. Looking up, she spotted the man searching on her other side. They exchanged waves and a few shouted words.</p><p>The trees grew larger as the ground leveled, their rough boles sufficient to hide a child. She kept glancing to her left, where Kevin McNeil moved quietly through the woods, never a branch popping under his feet. He walked lightly, with a contained grace, no extraneous swing of the arms or bob of his head. A natural woodsman. It was easy to imagine him in buckskins and moccasins.</p><p>Several times, in the slow progress through the woods, Kevin came near enough for them to talk briefly.</p><p>\u201cNot very many women in the search-and-rescue group,\u201d he commented once.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mountain-climb,\u201d she said somewhat defensively, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always loved hiking, so I thought I could help in this kind of search even if I\u2019m not strong enough to carry an injured man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that as criticism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did feel you needed to help me over a rough bit.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d have sworn his eyes darkened even as his voice deepened. \u201cNeeded? No. It just seemed like a good excuse.\u201d</p><p>He was flirting with her, the mother of an eight-year-old. She didn\u2019t have the experience often.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said inanely.</p> <p>Obviously she didn\u2019t have the experience often enough, Melanie thought ruefully.</p><p>She was immediately annoyed at herself for worrying about something so frivolous when a child was missing.</p><p>A brief smile touched Kevin McNeil\u2019s eyes and mouth, but he turned away when a shout came from his left.</p><p>\u201cWell, will you look at that?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She looked, and felt a burst of elation. John Clooney, who owned Elk Springs\u2019s major furniture store and who had been part of the group, was striding toward them with a sleepy boy cradled in his arms.</p><p>Shaking his auburn head in wonderment, Kevin put his whistle to his mouth and blew three short sharp blasts, the signal to gather. Then he took the walkie-talkie from his belt and spoke briefly into it.</p><p>In the distance Melanie heard other whistles.</p><p>\u201cHello, Brandon,\u201d Kevin said, when John had reached them. \u201cYour mommy has been looking for you.\u201d</p> <p>The boy buried his face shyly in John\u2019s chest. The adults laughed. When the whole party had gathered, they started down, taking turns carrying Brandon, who woke up and began to enjoy himself, bouncing on the men\u2019s shoulders and chattering.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Kevin said to Melanie, \u201cis one kid who needs to be kept on a leash. I\u2019ve never approved of leading a child around like a dog, but there\u2019s an exception to every rule.\u201d</p><p>She had been very aware that he was right beside her in the descent. \u201cThank God my daughter\u2019s timid!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cThe worst she ever did was hide inside a clothing rack at the Emporium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d he asked, matching his steps to hers. \u201cDoes she look like her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d Angie\u2019s hair was a shade darker, her brown eyes a shade lighter, but she had Melanie\u2019s round face and snub nose. \u201cAlthough she\u2019s going to be taller. Like her father. Right now, she\u2019s skinny, shy and sweet. Angie is the kind who stands up for a classmate when other kids are making fun of him. She has a good heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me she gets that from you, too.\u201d</p><p>Flustered, Melanie stopped and let others pass on the narrow trail. \u201cYou\u2019re flirting with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed.\u201d For the first time, his lean tanned face looked wary. \u201cYou\u2019re not flirting back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a mom! I don\u2019t know how.\u201d Now she felt incredibly stupid.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not married.\u201d</p><p>Someone else brushed past them. Melanie shook her head.</p><p>\u201cEngaged?\u201d When she shook her head again, he said, \u201cSeeing someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Now she sounded as shy as her daughter.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He had a way of investing that drawn-out sound with a rumble of satisfaction that brought warmth to her cheeks. \u201cWell, then, Melanie Parker, would you have dinner with me some night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to remedy that.\u201d He took pity on her. \u201cI\u2019ve just started teaching at the community college. My brother is general manager at the Juanita Butte ski area. Scott McNeil?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d read his name in the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m respectable,\u201d he promised, in that velvet-deep voice he used when he was looking straight into her eyes.</p><p>She did sometimes dream of finding a man she could love, of remarrying, of perhaps even having another child. But the odds had never seemed very good, given that she was thirty now and the good men her age in Elk Springs were generally married.</p><p>And she was not leaving Elk Springs, no matter what. She\u2019d decided that some time ago. She\u2019d had a lifetime of wandering. This was home. Angie would grow up in the rambling old house Melanie had inherited when Nana died. She would never have to tearfully leave her friends behind or walk into a new school midterm, facing a roomful of mocking strangers. Angie, Melanie had vowed four years ago when she\u2019d come home to Elk Springs for good, would always know where she belonged.</p><p>But Kevin McNeil was apparently single, incredibly sexy and established right here in Elk Springs. Dreams did come true, a small inner voice whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sounded gruff rather than sultry, but her throat seemed to be constricting her vocal chords.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019d like to have dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His smile was slightly crooked, almost tender and heart-stoppingly sexy. \u201cNow that we have that out of the way, let\u2019s go watch a reunion.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cWELL, WELL, WELL.\u201d Kevin rotated on his heels, gazing in wonder at the racks and heaps of fantastic, colorful costumes that filled the room like Aladdin\u2019s cave.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask what I did for a living.\u201d Melanie watched him from the doorway.</p><p>When he\u2019d seen the sign outside her old house, the one arching above the white picket fence that bounded her yard, he\u2019d asked to see some of the costumes. Somehow, he hadn\u2019t pictured such...profusion. Or the exquisite detail that made these garments light-years from the cheap Halloween costumes sold to kids for trick-or-treating.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t picture what you did for a living.\u201d Something physical, he had guessed, despite her pale silky skin, a delicious contrast to her warm brown hair. But she was slim and fit and moved well. Besides, not that many women joined the search-and-rescue group. She might own a nursery or work for the county parks or make cabinets. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t have guessed something so...\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cOutlandish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnusual,\u201d he corrected, eyeing an elaborate green velvet dress that might have been Elizabethan in style. With her smooth long hair and tall slender figure, Melanie would look gorgeous in it.</p><p>Unusual wasn\u2019t the first word that had come to mind, however. It was domestic, and this bothered him. The women he\u2019d been involved with were biologists, park rangers, oil geologists. They were outdoorswomen, with lives often as nomadic as his.</p><p>But what difference did it make? he asked himself. He and Melanie Parker didn\u2019t have a relationship; they were going on one date. The future wasn\u2019t an issue.</p><p>She looked around now, too, her expression reminiscent, even bemused. \u201cIt started small. The granddaughter of one of Nana\u2019s friends was getting married. She complained about how mundane all the wedding dresses she saw were. She didn\u2019t want to look like every other bride, she said. I asked what she wanted to look like. She ended up with a Renaissance theme. Her dress was white and gold and absolutely glorious, if I do say so myself. The bridesmaids all wore deep-blue silk over gold embroidered underskirts, the bodices really low cut...\u201d Unselfconsciously, she gestured at her own bosom, making all too vivid the picture she drew. \u201cSlashed fines-trella sleeves...\u201d She blinked, apparently realizing she had probably lost him. \u201cAnyway, the dresses were a hit. I\u2019d been job-hunting, but I was asked to make the gowns for another wedding and then another. Eventually I branched out into other types of costumes. Now I rent, as well as sell. Obviously\u2014\u201d she touched an exotic Gypsy-style dress hanging beside her \u201c\u2014this is my busy time of year. Usually more of these costumes are packed away.\u201d</p><p>Kevin hadn\u2019t dressed up for Halloween in twenty years. Yet interestingly, most of these costumes were in adult sizes.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you be for Halloween?\u201d he asked, tilting his head.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Melanie wrinkled her nose. \u201cA seamstress trapped behind my sewing machine making last-minute alterations. Somebody is sure to show up at the last possible second saying his costume doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d Her pursed lips barely hid her sudden merriment. \u201cNow, you...why, I think you have the legs to be a Regency dandy. Or maybe you\u2019d prefer a seventeenth-century French getup with bloomer breeches fastened below the knees with garters. Striped breeches. Say, red and gold. Crimson tights work well below that. They accentuate the calves\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kevin recoiled. \u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to look thoughtful, a smile playing around her generous mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve never made chain mail, but I could try, if that\u2019s more your thing...\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t say my tastes have ever been that kinky, but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into...\u201d</p><p>Melanie gave a startled giggle. She slapped her fingers to her lips. \u201cOh, dear. I sound like Angie.\u201d Her pretty brown eyes reproved him. \u201cMaybe we should go.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over the jaw he\u2019d shaved only half an hour before. \u201cMaybe so. Although I\u2019m beginning to wish we were going to a costume ball. So I could see you in that dress.\u201d He nodded toward the green velvet number.</p><p>She glanced down at herself. What she was actually wearing was a short black skirt, black tights and a V-neck snug-fitting sweater the color of a ripe plum. She looked Bohemian, a young poet ready to go to a coffeehouse for deep and lengthy discussions about politics and art and love.</p><p>Hell, Kevin thought, forget the Elizabethan getup; he kind of liked her the way she was, hair swishing over her shoulder in a ponytail that had started atop her head and was already sliding down from its own weight. The other day, when he should have been focused on nothing but finding a four-year-old in green corduroy, his head had kept turning until he spotted Melanie Parker with that leggy distinctive walk. Bands of late-afternoon sunlight had broken between the pines above, awakening a quiet glow in her hair that had been tumbling from its confines then, too. It had looked like heavy silk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He could hardly wait to slide his fingers into it and feel the thick strands slip like water between them.</p><p>A date, he reminded himself. This was only a date.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going anyplace fancy, are we?\u201d she asked, sounding anxious.</p><p>\u201cNo need for velvet tonight.\u201d He crossed the room to her and touched her chin, lifting it until their eyes met. \u201cI like what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d Especially the way the skirt revealed those legs that went on forever.</p> <p>Definitely a downside to the floor-length gowns of past centuries.</p><p>He took her to Mario\u2019s, a local pizza joint his brother had introduced him to the first week he was in Elk Springs. A thick yeasty crust and distinctive mix of cheeses made their pizza one of a kind. The place was big, barnlike, with private booths and candlelight. Comfortable, but atmospheric enough for an evening out.</p><p>Melanie didn\u2019t introduce him to her daughter and he didn\u2019t ask where the girl was. They chatted about nothing special on the short drive, then argued amiably over which pizza toppings to order before finally sitting down with a pitcher of beer. She barely sipped at hers, Kevin noticed.</p><p>Seeing his glance, Melanie made a face. \u201cI get tipsy easily. Then I don\u2019t know how to shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet secrets slip out, do you?\u201d he asked, amused.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me one now,\u201d he challenged her. \u201cOr at least, something significant about you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t disappoint him. Her chin came up and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to ever leave Elk Springs. I\u2019ve traveled all my life and now I\u2019m staying put.\u201d</p><p>His reaction to her confident announcement was a peculiar mix. He\u2019d never imagined staying in one place forever. The idea made him...edgy. Claustrophobic. He also felt admiration and even envy at her certainty\u2014he didn\u2019t quite know what he was going to do with the rest of his life. And finally, a kind of panic rippled at the edges of his awareness. What was he doing here with her, a woman who lived behind a white picket fence, that universal symbol of domesticity?</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of travel?\u201d he asked. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>While they waited for their pizza, she talked about her childhood as an Air Force brat. Her father had been transferred frequently, dragging his family along. Base housing was almost indistinguishable from place to place, but friends were always left behind.</p> <p>\u201cFlorida, Germany, Japan, California, Washington\u2014we never stayed more than three years anywhere. My daydreams were always of a real home. Marrying a boy I\u2019d known since kindergarten.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cSo guess who I married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fighter pilot?\u201d he hazarded.</p><p>\u201cA baseball player.\u201d</p><p>He almost laughed, her answer was so unexpected.</p><p>\u201cMinor league. Of course, we just knew he was going to make the big time, and then we\u2019d have it all. For the moment, I\u2019d travel with him and we\u2019d live in crummy rental housing, but once he was a Yankee or a Blue Jay or an Angel, we\u2019d buy a house and start a family, and I could join him sometimes on road trips, just for fun. The only thing is, he didn\u2019t make it that far. He got called up and then sent down again and then got traded. One town after another. We lived in lousy apartments and mobile homes, and half the time he was gone. I got pregnant by accident, and once Angie was born, it was harder. Ryan wasn\u2019t ready to be a father, he admitted.\u201d Pain finally showed on her gentle face. \u201cThen I found out he was seeing other women when the team was on the road. There I was, trying hard to make a home, and he didn\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>As if by instinct, Kevin\u2019s hand covered hers on the table. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came home to Elk Springs,\u201d Melanie said simply. \u201cMy grandmother lived here, in that house. My whole life, she was here. We\u2019d visit, sometimes, for two weeks, or later I\u2019d even stay all summer.\u201d She wasn\u2019t seeing him again, her gaze poignantly fixed on the past. \u201cI had my own bedroom, upstairs under the eaves, with flowered wallpaper she let me pick out myself. It\u2019s Angie\u2019s bedroom now. Oh, how I wanted to stay and go to school in Elk Springs, but my parents wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d Her voice ached with longing. \u201cAfter my divorce, though, Nana welcomed Angie and me with open arms. She encouraged me to go into business for myself.\u201d Melanie\u2019s eyes met his again, the sadness in them telling him the end to this story. \u201cShe died last winter and left me the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re never leaving it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She sounded utterly composed. \u201cI want my daughter to grow up in one place, with friendships that span more than a year or two. I love what I do for a living, being able to walk at night without worrying, knowing the people in every business I frequent. I like to plant perennials and bulbs and know I\u2019ll see them come up in the spring. Hawaii in the winter might be nice\u2014for two weeks. Then give me home.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI think that\u2019s our number they\u2019re calling. Then it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn?\u201d He slid out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cYour secret.\u201d</p><p>His secret. Damn. Did he tell her about the bullet he\u2019d taken in his gut? Or the revelation he\u2019d had afterward as he slowly recovered in a hospital bed?</p><p>Kevin grabbed the pizza and two plates, bringing them back to the table. He tried to figure out what to say to her as he dished up thick slices and swore when strands of cheese wrapped around his fingers.</p><p>Be honest about the changes in his life? Admit he was feeling his way like a man in the woods on a pitch-black night? One who knew which way to go, or thought he did, if he hadn\u2019t been turned around completely, or if the moon cloaked in clouds wasn\u2019t really behind him, instead of ahead?</p><p>Or stick to what he did know?</p><p>\u201cTell me something significant about you,\u201d she said, after enjoying her first bite.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was growing up, I never wanted a home.\u201d Scare her off, why don\u2019t you? he thought, seeing her startlement. \u201cMy father loved the wilderness,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe camped, hiked, backpacked, cross-country skied. Every minute when he wasn\u2019t working, we headed into the backcountry. Scott loved the out-of-doors, too, but once he discovered alpine skiing, that was it for him. Me?\u201d Kevin shrugged. \u201cI liked the silence and the loneliness of the forest or the canyons. When you cross-country ski, the only sound is the swish of your own skis on the snow, the plop of a heavy clump falling from a branch. I like being in places where I\u2019m the only human for miles. I dreamed of manning one of those lonely fire lookouts or testing the water in salmon-spawning streams in the Olympic Mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you become a college professor?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the National Park Service the past fifteen years. But it\u2019s changed.\u201d While they ate he talked about the crowds who were ruining the great wilderness areas saved as national parks; about the vandalism and the crime and the increasing role park rangers had as law-enforcement officers. \u201cThe pay is no great shakes,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe housing is similar to what you described on military bases, the transfers got old... I found myself trying to restore meadows trampled by millions of feet, instead of interpreting the pristine wilderness for eager visitors. I woke up one day\u2014\u201d in a hospital bed \u201c\u2014and realized the job wasn\u2019t for me anymore. Scott told me about an opening here in Elk Springs, at the community college, teaching forestry and park management, and I grabbed it. He loves Elk Springs, it looked like a nice town on my visits, and if I hanker for the backcountry, there\u2019s plenty of it within an easy drive.\u201d He gestured, a slice of pizza in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve never taught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was primarily a naturalist with the Park Service, which means I spent the greater part of my career leading groups on nature walks, designing interpretive centers or hikes, writing handouts and so on. All teaching, in a way.\u201d</p><p>Melanie was easy to talk to. He admitted to his cowardice on the day he\u2019d walked into his first classroom. But now he found the teaching stimulating. A few kids were taking one of his classes because it met some requirement and they thought it would be a no-brainer. Those were discovering their mistake. The other kids were excited. Many had grown up in Elk Springs or Bend or Medford, and they\u2019d spent their youths hiking in these mountains or rock-hunting in the high-desert country. They wanted to know how to protect the wilderness, how to log responsibly, how to follow a career in the park or forest services.</p><p>The evening passed with incredible speed. Usually closemouthed, Kevin realized he\u2019d talked away a good deal of it. When he wasn\u2019t talking but listening, he was captivated by Melanie\u2019s face. The delicate line of her cheeks, her small nose, the widow\u2019s peak her brown hair formed on her graceful forehead. All fascinated him and somehow added up to an utterly feminine face, which was also strong. He could see the will beneath the softness.</p><p>He had always had an image of women who were homebodies, whose greatest dreams were to sew and raise children, and they were nothing like Melanie Parker. As the end of the evening neared, Kevin found that his resistance to seriously seeing a woman like her was crumbling with nary a whimper.</p><p>Big deal. Another date. Another few dates. He wasn\u2019t asking her to marry him, was he?</p><p>And dammit, he had decided in that hospital bed to change his life, to settle down. Okay, he hadn\u2019t thought as far ahead as marriage or children or a white picket fence, but would it be so bad? He\u2019d left the Park Service\u2014although technically he was on leave and hadn\u2019t resigned. Maybe Elk Springs would become his permanent home. Maybe he\u2019d met Melanie Parker for a reason.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring,\u201d she said.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even realized she\u2019d quit talking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was thinking\u2014\u201d why not admit it? \u201c\u2014about kissing you good-night. Come on.\u201d He slid from the booth and held out his hand for hers. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Pink rose in her cheeks, but after only the tiniest hesitation she laid her hand in his and scooted out. Neither had brought coats, although the nights were starting to get cold.</p><p>Unfortunately downtown Elk Springs was bustling. People emerged from restaurants, and the gallery across the street had something going on. Music, light and voices poured from it. Kevin had a moment of frustration and even irritation. If he and Melanie were backpacking, they could be lying on their sleeping bags right now staring up at a sky spangled vividly with stars, not washed out by electric lights. Maybe the coals of a small fire would glow beside them. Didn\u2019t these people in town ever long for solitude, silence, a pure experience of the earth as it had been created?</p><p>Melanie saw his face and tugged at his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s walk down by the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d His bad mood passed as quickly as it had come. He wasn\u2019t used to crowds anymore. He would adjust. Melanie might be just the person to help him.</p><p>A block away, they left behind the busy sidewalks and soon found the city park on the banks of the Deschutes in front of them. He\u2019d have liked to throw rocks and break the lights illuminating the parking lot, but at least the grassy bank of the river was dark, the whisper of the river current more powerful than the now-muted voices behind them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is more like it.\u201d The tension eased. \u201cAt last I can kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can only do it in the dark?\u201d Gentle humor infused her words. \u201cDoes my face scare you?\u201d</p><p>He framed it with his hands. His voice became husky. \u201cYour face is exquisite. The tiny dimple that forms next to your mouth when you smile has been driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she murmured, sounding shy. Her hands stole up to flatten on his chest. \u201cI like your face, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, kissing is a good way to seal our mutual admiration. And...express it more fully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Melanie spoke gravely. \u201cI suspect that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>His head bent; his mouth paused a hairbreadth from hers. \u201cI\u2019m glad we agree.\u201d</p><p>She rose onto tiptoe and their lips touched, a soft tentative brush, then met again to linger. Exhilaration and desire crashed through him, but he resisted the powerful urge to yank her up against him. Nipping, sampling, he told himself to take it slow. She didn\u2019t strike him as a woman who would easily indulge in an affair. A husband went with a home. Until he knew he wanted to be any such thing, he had to be careful.</p><p>But moving away was one of the hardest things he\u2019d ever done. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, in a voice only a little gritty, \u201cwas the perfect cap to a wonderful evening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was nice, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we do it again tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. I can\u2019t leave Angie too often.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cBut she has a soccer game tomorrow afternoon. Would you like to come?\u201d</p><p>I have a child, she might as well have said. He recognized the gauntlet: Are you serious, or aren\u2019t you?</p><p>Kevin took a deep breath and said, \u201cWhen and where?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p> <p>THE FOOTBALL SPIRALED through the floodlit sky and dropped neatly between the goalposts. The crowd in the stands, wearing parkas and gloves against the cold night, erupted to their feet to scream their approval. On the sidelines, the elk trumpeted his triumph and dipped his antlers in challenge to the team from Medford on the other side of the field.</p><p>Melanie smiled. The antlers had been a neat trick. She was rather proud of her elaborate construction of wire and plaster-cast material wrapped in brown cotton velvet. The head, too, she thought rivaled Northwest Coast Indian masks; she\u2019d even used some cedar in a bow to the tradition. Now, if only the high-school kids took good care of the costume...</p><p>\u201cNice work,\u201d Kevin said from beside her. His gaze was following hers. \u201cThe kid playing the elk is having a helluva good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Tiffany Schaefer\u2019s boyfriend\u2014she\u2019s the baby-sitter I use most regularly. I understand that having a mascot for the high-school football and basketball teams was his idea. Obviously he\u2019s a bit of a ham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s Tiffany?\u201d Kevin nodded toward the pyramid of cheerleaders, topped by a petite blonde.</p><p>Angie bounced on Melanie\u2019s other side. \u201cShe\u2019s really pretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Melanie didn\u2019t envy Tiffany\u2019s older sister, who was raising her. Tiffany was great with children, but sometimes impulsive. She was also ravishingly beautiful, a combination that would make any guardian nervous.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Kevin murmured as the Elks kicked off. The seconds were ticking down; that last field goal had put the home team ahead by six. Only a touchdown could beat them now.</p> <p>Melanie had never attended an Elk Springs High School football game before, but the draw of seeing Tiffany in action, as well as the debut of the mascot, had been irresistible. When she had mentioned to Kevin that she and Angie were going, he\u2019d promptly said, \u201cDo you want company? Did I tell you I was the quarterback in high school?\u201d</p><p>Angie, predictably, was bored and cold. She was far more interested in the antics of the cheerleaders than the action on the field, which she didn\u2019t understand. \u201cHow come he threw the ball away?\u201d she would ask. \u201cWhy does the other team have it now? Why doesn\u2019t he get up and keep running?\u201d</p><p>Kevin tried to explain, but Angie didn\u2019t really want to know what a \u201cdown\u201d was. She wanted the game to be over so they could go for pizza, which Kevin had promised.</p><p>Medford made the mistake of trying to move the ball on the ground. Fourth down, three yards to go. The crowd stayed breathlessly on their feet, Melanie and Kevin among them. Linemen smashed into each other; bodies piled up. The ball came squirting out and, with a bellow, a stocky Elk Springs linebacker threw himself on it. The game was over.</p><p>Joining the mob filing out of the stadium, Melanie had to stop half a dozen times to talk to people she knew. It gave her great satisfaction every time someone called out her name. She loved that this was the kind of small town where she met friends, acquaintances and customers everywhere she went. Who would want to live constantly among strangers when you could have this sense of community?</p><p>Of course, she had to introduce Kevin over and over. He was relaxed and friendly, seeming not to mind the curiosity in people\u2019s eyes. As they crossed the parking lot, however, and Angie ran ahead to his four-by-four, he murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t you date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot often,\u201d Melanie admitted. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been sized up that way since the first time I asked a girl to go steady. And that was in fifth grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNosiness is a human condition.\u201d</p><p>Being able to introduce him had added a delightful fillip to the evening, she had to admit, if only to herself. She could hardly believe she\u2019d been so lucky as to have Kevin interested in her. Of course, she\u2019d dreamed she might meet the right man and remarry someday. But Elk Springs wasn\u2019t loaded with possibilities. Then he\u2019d appeared that day at the park, a newcomer in town. If they fell in love\u2014Melanie didn\u2019t want to admit that she might already be halfway there\u2014if they got so far, he would surely be willing to stay in Elk Springs. Why not? His brother was here, he seemed to be enjoying teaching at the community college, and as he\u2019d said himself, central Oregon was perfect for a lover of the outdoors.</p><p>Some mornings Melanie had to pinch herself to make sure her happiness was real. This was their fifth date. Better yet, he was willing to do real things. For example, he\u2019d not only attended Angie\u2019s soccer game, he\u2019d volunteered to be the assistant coach for the rest of the year.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free afternoons,\u201d he\u2019d said that day when the coach asked for volunteers. \u201cSure, I\u2019ve played the game.\u201d Deftly stealing the ball from one of the girls, he\u2019d started bumping it on his knee.</p><p>\u201cWill you show us how to do that?\u201d Angie had piped up.</p><p>Angie, predictably, thought the sun rose and set with Kevin. That part worried Melanie a little. She had only dated him five times. What if they didn\u2019t fall in love? Was Angie counting too much on Kevin always being around?</p><p>At the pizza parlor\u2014more generic than Mario\u2019s, and also more to the taste of eight-year-old girls\u2014most of the diners had been at the football game. The mood was jovial, the noise level high.</p><p>They grabbed a booth some teenagers had just left. Angie found friends and begged a pile of quarters off Kevin and her mom, after which she disappeared into the video-game room.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have given her so many,\u201d Melanie said. \u201cShe won\u2019t give up next time she wants something from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I remember how frustrating it was when your parents only doled out two quarters. They were gone in about thirty seconds, and then all you could do was stand around and watch other kids play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes parents have to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they do.\u201d He watched her with a small frown on his face, as if he sensed she was worried about more than the indulgence of a little money.</p><p>\u201cBut was this one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p><p>His big hand gripped hers with the strength she loved. \u201cShe\u2019s a great kid. I like her.\u201d</p><p>But she loves you, Melanie thought. She couldn\u2019t say that, either. Wasn\u2019t even sure she wanted to. What was wrong with her? Ten minutes ago she\u2019d been incredibly, idiotically happy. Now she was brooding about the future.</p><p>For once, why couldn\u2019t she just enjoy herself? Fall in love. Get her heart broken. It happened. She and Angie would survive. She\u2019d be crazy not to take the risk. Especially considering how perfect Kevin was for her.</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she said, giving his hand a squeeze. \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re great, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go hiking this weekend?\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou know all the best places to go, right?\u201d</p><p>Melanie immediately thought of a lake she\u2019d always loved, nestled on the flanks of Juanita Butte. Five miles in, the walk was too long for Angie, so Melanie hadn\u2019t been in a long time. But maybe Angie could spend the day with a friend.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, this late in the season the trail and the shores of the pristine mountain lake would be nearly deserted. She and Kevin could be truly alone.</p><p>Not that alone! she chided herself instantly.</p><p>Of course, he saw her blush, she knew he did, but she only said briskly, \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>His grin was positively wicked. \u201cAlone at last,\u201d he murmured, and she blushed again.</p><p>He\u2019d definitely read her mind.</p><p>\u201cSO...LET\u2019S TALK about logging. How do we balance the need for lumber and jobs with our responsibility for protecting the environment? Should the national forests be logged? Or is the Forest Service doing nothing but selling out the public interest? What about these timber trades? Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Kevin leaned comfortably against the windowsill in his classroom. Twenty-five students in this forestry class. Five or six would be truly vocal, another few might chime in with a remark or two. The others he\u2019d have to poke and prod.</p><p>Which he was discovering he was pretty good at. Sometimes he could even fire them up enough to fuel a good argument. They\u2019d been studying logging practices, the new federal formulas for how much timber could be taken, the dismal financial picture for mills and logging communities. Now he wanted to know what they thought, where their convictions lay.</p><p>Tim Naber, who always had something to say, leaned forward in his chair. The kind with a small attached writing surface, it looked too small for his large frame. \u201cThe Forest Service panders to loggers. Their first obligation should be to save the public lands for future generations. Hell\u2014I mean, heck\u2014they\u2019re selling timber for practically nothing, anyway! They should at least be getting a fair price. No landowner would sell trees for what our government takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Kevin spread his hands and looked around. \u201cWhat do the rest of you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a government by the people for the people.\u201d The kid who spoke up was one who rarely participated. Now his cheeks were flushed with anger. \u201cWe restrict logging too severely and we\u2019re hurting people. Whole communities are living on welfare. Are owls more important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d another kid agreed. \u201cAnd if we sell the timber for as much as private landowners, more loggers will go out of business, and lumber will get so expensive people won\u2019t be able to afford to build houses. Like, is that what we want?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The discussion\u2014okay, argument\u2014ranged freely after that, with Kevin occasionally refereeing. By the time he had to say, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s stop here,\u201d he was pleased both with the fiery exchanges and the informed level of the entire discussion.</p><p>He\u2019d made the decision from the beginning to encourage not only dispassionate analysis but also moral involvement in decision-making. Management of forests was no longer by the numbers. The issues were complex, and what was right or wrong was far from clear. He was getting these kids to think\u2014and to see one another\u2019s viewpoints.</p><p>Teaching was proving more satisfying than he\u2019d expected. Lying in that hospital bed after getting shot at Mount Rainier National Park, Kevin had known it was time for a change. But in truth, he\u2019d grabbed this opportunity more to give himself a chance to reflect than to become a career college professor. Being shut in a classroom day in and day out\u2014the idea had been anathema to him once upon a time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to decide yet what to do with the rest of his life\u2014it was only October, he was committed to the college through May\u2014but he was starting to think there were worse ways to make a living.</p> <p>Whether or not he wanted to do it in Elk Springs...hell, he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t even know if there was a permanent job here for him.</p><p>What he did know was that he should have told Melanie Parker some of this. He hadn\u2019t said, \u201cMy teaching position is temporary.\u201d He hadn\u2019t admitted that he felt like an eighteen-year-old kid again, on the brink of a world full of possibilities but unsure which one to grab. No, not again\u2014when he was eighteen, he\u2019d known what he wanted to do with his life. He\u2019d still be doing the same thing if he could have held on to the ideal: protecting the wilderness he loved, teaching others to do the same. But his disillusionment and frustration had been growing for years, coming to a head the day he\u2019d ordered some drunken idiots to pack up the party they\u2019d been holding in a fragile meadow, only to have one of them pull out a gun and shoot him.</p><p>He could still remember vividly the moment he fell, face smacking into a patch of late snow, the scent of rich earth and avalanche lilies in his nostrils. He\u2019d heard the ensuing excited discussion, the thud of feet as they fled. He\u2019d be dead if a mountain guide hadn\u2019t heard the gunshot and come to investigate.</p><p>Kevin didn\u2019t want to be cop. He didn\u2019t want to share his wilderness with drunks or with lazy folks who didn\u2019t bother to get out of their RVs or even with nice families who came to see nature\u2019s wonders but didn\u2019t respect them.</p><p>It was time to get into another line of business.</p> <p>Okay, fine. But he should have admitted to some of his uncertainty about the future to Melanie. He\u2019d been kissing her, when they had the chance, like a man who meant it. Not like one who was going to walk away as soon as he figured out his route.</p><p>She was adding to his confusion, because he was starting to think he didn\u2019t want to leave her behind. He was making himself go slowly, be sure. It would be easy to get caught up in this new life, think he was ready to make it permanent and then wake up one morning and realize a small town and a wedding ring and a stepdaughter were hemming him in unbearably.</p><p>But dammit, he liked the kid, and he liked her mother even more. Melanie insisted she wasn\u2019t ever leaving Elk Springs, but then, she\u2019d been speaking as a single mother, not as a wife.</p><p>Whoa! he thought, locking the classroom door behind him. Let\u2019s not get hasty here. Wife\u2014that was a strong word.</p><p>Too strong.</p><p>But he did enjoy thinking about her: the tiny dimple beside her mouth, her low throaty chuckle, the tenderness in her eyes when she talked about her daughter. His body tightened when he just pictured her leggy walk, the swing of hips, the graceful line of her neck and the heavy silk of that hair. He wanted her fiercely, and would have had her by now if she\u2019d been anything but what she was: a woman who was made for marriage and motherhood, not hot sex that was...well, not meaningless\u2014he hoped he\u2019d never had such a thing\u2014but not a symbol of commitment, either.</p> <p>Walking across the campus to his office, appreciating the bright fallen leaves and the crisp autumn air, he figured life was good. Unsettled, maybe, but how many men his age could see so many possibilities waiting to be grabbed?</p><p>Maybe the experience was wasted on teenagers.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE BEAUTIFUL,\u201d Kevin said, staring.</p><p>Pleasure spread in a warm tide all the way to Melanie\u2019s fingers and toes as he looked his fill. It was only the dress, she tried to tell herself. But the glow in his eyes made her suspect he was imagining her with the dress off, not admiring the heavy folds of velvet or the fit of the stiff bodice.</p><p>Well, maybe the fit of the bodice.</p><p>More warmth eddied. She couldn\u2019t blame the long-sleeved gown for making her feel overheated.</p><p>\u201cThank you, kind sir.\u201d Melanie dipped in a curtsy. \u201cYou make a handsome pirate.\u201d</p> <p>He did look rather dashing in snug black pants and knee-high boots, a red scarf knotted on his head and a white shirt open at the throat with billowing sleeves cuffed at the wrist. He had refused the ubiquitous black eye patch.</p><p>\u201cI want to be able to see you,\u201d he\u2019d said simply.</p><p>Someone had wanted to rent the green velvet Elizabethan gown. The someone was a good customer, a doctor\u2019s wife whose daughter had just announced her engagement. Melanie should have been trying to please her.</p><p>But she\u2019d heard herself saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m afraid that one...\u201d Is already reserved, she\u2019d been about to say, but what if the doctor\u2019s wife appeared at the same Halloween party Kevin was taking Melanie to? She\u2019d swallowed and admitted, \u201cI\u2019m holding on to that dress for myself. The man I\u2019m dating especially admired it.\u201d She waited for annoyance to spread across Linda Colvin\u2019s face.</p><p>Instead, her client had smiled with delight. \u201cReally? You\u2019re dating? It must be serious.\u201d She\u2019d moved a heap of garments from a chair and plopped down. \u201cTell all.\u201d</p><p>Melanie wasn\u2019t about to tell all to anyone, but she did admit that she was dating Scott McNeil\u2019s brother.</p><p>Tonight she hadn\u2019t invited Kevin over until after she\u2019d accompanied Angie and three friends trick-or-treating in their neighborhood. That was another thing Melanie liked about Elk Springs\u2014the fact that children could still safely accept candy from people they didn\u2019t know. It just seemed as if nobody in town was really a stranger. She could stop a woman on the street and in the course of chatting discover that she had a child in Angie\u2019s class at school or had been a bridesmaid in a wedding for which Melanie had made the gowns. Melanie knew at least by reputation many of the neighbors, even if she hadn\u2019t personally met them. At the wonderful Queen Anne house two blocks down, for example, lived Jack Murray, the county sheriff, who had recently married a woman who also hired Tiffany Schaefer to baby-sit. Circles of overlapping acquaintances\u2014the very thing that made Elk Springs home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met your brother,\u201d she said on the way out to the car.</p><p>\u201cScott is a good guy.\u201d Kevin opened the car door for her and bowed gallantly. \u201cHis wife is a cop. Did I say that? Half the people who\u2019ll be here tonight are probably cops, too.\u201d</p><p>Melanie adjusted her skirts and latched her seat belt, thinking what an anachronism she was, a sixteenth-century woman in a twenty-first-century vehicle.</p><p>When the costumed Kevin had joined her, somehow also looking appropriate behind the wheel of the manly vehicle, she asked, \u201cWhat do a bunch of police officers talk about when they get together socially?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. They get grisly once in a while, but half the time you find the women talking recipes and children and the men sports or politics. Scott\u2019s adopted daughter must be close to Angie\u2019s age, plus, he has a toddler.\u201d</p><p>The driveway leading to Scott McNeil\u2019s modern cedar-sided home up the mountain highway was lined with paper lanterns in ghostly white with bats flitting as the candles flickered. A dozen or more jack-o\u2019-lanterns crowded the front steps, and eerie music spilled out.</p><p>Melanie found her worries about fitting in squelched immediately. Scott looked enough like Kevin to be his twin; both men were broad-shouldered, athletic, tanned and auburn-haired. They slapped each other on the back in the affectionate way of men, and Kevin introduced Melanie to Scott\u2019s wife, Meg, and her sisters, Abby and Renee. All three were blond, elegant, attractive women with ready smiles and vintage gowns. Abby was a flapper, Renee a Gibson girl and Meg a Second World War woman of means.</p><p>\u201cOoh!\u201d Abby exclaimed when she set eyes on Melanie. \u201cI thought I looked good until I saw you. Wow. What a dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Melanie explained what she did for a living and discovered\u2014of course\u2014that the three sisters had heard of her. Renee, in fact, was good friends with Linda Colvin, the doctor\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cWe went to high school together, believe it or not,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, Linda\u2019s here somewhere...\u201d She glanced over her shoulder toward the living room.</p><p>Melanie gave silent thanks that she hadn\u2019t lied about why she couldn\u2019t rent the Elizabethan gown. Honesty was indeed the best policy, she thought.</p><p>Further conversation revealed that Meg and Scott\u2019s adopted daughter, Emily, was in Angie\u2019s class. After that, conversation was a breeze.</p><p>In fact, Melanie ended up having a wonderful time. She liked everyone she met. The finger food was divine, the dancing, which spilled out onto a huge back deck, despite the chilly night, was fun, and Kevin was flatteringly attentive. It was with regret that Melanie realized the party was breaking up.</p><p>She\u2019d been listening to Kevin tell stories about his days in the Park Service: about smoke-jumping, dangerous mountain rescues and nights spent tucked on precipitous ledges. All were entertaining, some funny, some suspenseful.</p><p>At the last minute one of the men who\u2019d been listening said something that bothered Melanie enough she knew she\u2019d have to think about it later.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be happy shut in a classroom nine months of the year!\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cSounds like the life.\u201d</p><p>Kevin laughed and demurred, but with some anxiety Melanie studied his face and would have sworn she saw regret there.</p><p>Surely only a reminiscent kind, she told herself quickly, a momentary sadness for times gone by. He wouldn\u2019t have quit his job as a park ranger and moved to Elk Springs if he wasn\u2019t ready to settle down. Would he?</p><p>As Kevin ushered her out the door, his hand firmly planted on the small of her back, Abby called after Melanie, \u201cCan I come by your place and see it?\u201d She smiled flirtatiously at her husband, a dark handsome man who was also a cop. \u201cIf you have more outfits like the one you\u2019re wearing, I may dress up more often.\u201d</p><p>Lieutenant Ben Shea smiled at his wife with an expression that made Melanie\u2019s heart skip a beat. Had anybody ever looked at her like that?</p><p>\u201cYou do that, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I ask is, not too many buttons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abby elbowed him. Laughing, Kevin and Melanie made it out the door. The air had a real bite, and she saw her breath in the porchlight. A parka would have clashed with her dress, but she wished she had one now.</p><p>\u201cBrr,\u201d she said. \u201cI can feel winter hovering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine months of winter, three months of summer. Isn\u2019t that what they say about Elk Springs?\u201d</p><p>She hurried to the defense of her home. \u201cWe have a spring. Sort of. And an autumn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She poked him and he laughed again, a deep comfortable sound. Then he wrapped his arm around her shoulders and murmured in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m tempted to insult your beloved town just to see you get fired up.\u201d</p><p>Was she that bad? \u201cI get fired up about other things,\u201d she said defensively, then wished she could snatch the words back.</p><p>His voice became a sexy rumble. \u201cOh, I\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you didn\u2019t.\u201d He opened the door of his four-by-four. \u201cHop in, milady.\u201d</p><p>She let him give her a boost and rather enjoyed the way his hand lingered on her hip. His hand often lingered, she\u2019d noticed, as it had on the small of her back earlier. In fact, most of the evening he had kept a hand on her arm or back. Either he was someone who liked to touch, or he was very very attracted to her. She rather hoped it was the latter.</p><p>He went around and got in on the driver\u2019s side, but instead of belting himself in, he reached for her. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to kiss you all night,\u201d he said huskily, and bent his head.</p><p>Melanie met his mouth eagerly. She loved the feel of his hand cupping her head, his fingers working in her hair, his grip on her arm. His knuckles brushed the side of her breast, and she sighed.</p><p>A groan vibrated in his chest and the kiss deepened, his mouth suddenly hard and demanding. His tongue touched hers, and she was the one to moan. His hand flattened on her breast; she pushed against him, frustrated by the hard bodice of the dress.</p><p>His laugh against her mouth was ragged. \u201cHow the hell did people make love in those days?\u201d</p> <p>Breathlessly, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure they wore underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Briefly his hand flexed on her thigh. \u201cInteresting idea.\u201d</p><p>Very. She imagined him throwing her skirts up, dropping to his knees... A spasm deep in her belly almost made her moan again.</p><p>Headlights flashed in the rearview mirror, and Kevin swore, pulling back. \u201cMy sense of timing...\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I... The baby-sitter...\u201d She straightened her skirts, fought to steady her voice, couldn\u2019t help shrinking away. \u201cI really should get home.\u201d</p><p>She was a coward. He would have suggested she go home with him\u2014she knew he would have. She wanted to. But give her thirty seconds to think, and what did she do? Chicken out, of course. Women on the movie screen and in books made love anywhere and everywhere all the time. Heck, probably real women did, too, the ones she saw at the grocery or the stationery store. If they met a man and were attracted, they had sex with him. It wasn\u2019t as if Angie would ever know, Melanie thought miserably, and she was entitled to a life, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>But she just couldn\u2019t do something like that so casually. She needed to be very sure.</p><p>She needed to know she loved him.</p> <p>In silence, Kevin started the engine and put the vehicle into gear. Some of the Halloween lanterns had flickered out, while others burned low, wisps of mysterious light on each side of the wooded lane. Melanie stared fiercely out the window and tried not to cry.</p><p>What if he asked, Will you come home with me? Would she really tell him no?</p><p>Not, she admitted to herself, if he once looked at her the way Ben Shea had at his wife Abby, with such passion and tenderness and intensity. With such...love.</p><p>Oh, no, she thought, her stomach lurching. She couldn\u2019t be in love. Not already! Not when Kevin had said nothing to suggest he was thinking about wedding bells and forever.</p><p>His voice, edged with something indefinable, broke the silence about the time he made the turn onto the mountain highway. \u201cHey. I didn\u2019t mean to get carried away. I\u2019m sorry if I upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Oh, no!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI, um, enjoyed... I mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoyed is good.\u201d His hand reached over and clasped hers, warm and strong. \u201cI did, too.\u201d After a moment he asked, \u201cDid you have fun tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful time!\u201d She hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re quite a storyteller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I dominated the conversation,\u201d he said ruefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, no! Everyone enjoyed your stories. You know they did. You kept talking because people kept asking questions.\u201d Very casually she added, \u201cDo you miss such an adventurous life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss it?\u201d He shot her a look she couldn\u2019t interpret with only the light from the dashboard. \u201cRemind me sometime to tell you about my last day as a park ranger. That part I don\u2019t miss. Sure, I have moments where I feel...restless. But, you know, those were the exciting bits I was talking about tonight. Most of what I did was considerably more mundane. The nature walk for families is not exactly a stroll on the wild side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said cautiously, \u201cI suppose not. No regrets, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets are for old men.\u201d He sounded almost arrogant. \u201cI still have the chance to choose what I want to do with my life.\u201d</p><p>And what he had chosen was to live in Elk Springs. Relief loosened tension she\u2019d hardly known she was feeling. She\u2019d been silly; she could have told funny stories about her days as a minor-league baseball player\u2019s wife, too, but that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to go back.</p><p>\u201cI like your attitude,\u201d she decided. \u201cMost people are so...settled by our age. It must be exciting to change careers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed,\u201d his voice became a notch huskier, \u201cthat my personal life seems to be changing in a big way, too. You have something to do with that, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her heart squeezed. Did he mean...? Was he hinting...? He must be!</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t comment,\u201d she said lightly, \u201csince I don\u2019t know what your life was like before you met me.\u201d</p><p>His hand found hers again. \u201cOne hell of a lot emptier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her heart was drumming. \u201cKevin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome sweet home.\u201d He pulled up to the curb in front of her house and turned off the engine. The baby-sitter pulled back the curtain and peered out. Sounding regretful, Kevin said, \u201cLooks to me like you\u2019re eagerly awaited. And that we\u2019ll have to continue this discussion another day.\u201d</p><p>Another day? Could she bear to wait?</p><p>Did she have a choice?</p><p>\u201cI was lucky to get Tiffany tonight. I had to bribe her, big time. She\u2019s probably hoping to slip out with her boyfriend and egg a few houses before dawn.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and the moment was lost.</p><p>To be recaptured, Melanie reminded herself.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>WEARING AN IMPRESSIVE stovepipe hat and a black wool suit\u2014borrowed from a family of Civil War reenactors\u2014a very short Abraham Lincoln walked onto the stage, cleared his throat and waited for the audience to quit whispering. Voice unexpectedly gruff for an eight-year-old, he declared, \u201cFour square and seven years ago, our fathers bought forth on this continent, a new nation, con...conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the pop station that all men are created equal.\u201d</p><p>Beside Melanie, Kevin covered his mouth and cleared his throat. She knew very well that he was disguising a laugh. She was glad he\u2019d made the effort. Eight-year-olds were so very earnest.</p><p>After a strong start, the young Abraham Lincoln struggled with the remainder of the Gettysburg Address, his voice faltering, his wide desperate gaze occasionally turning to the wings of the stage for a cue. But at last he finished in triumph, \u201c...and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth!\u201d</p><p>Enthusiastic applause evoked a pleased smile and a deep bow from the boy, who was immediately succeeded on the stage by an equally short Elizabeth Cady Stanton, performed by Angie Parker. Her severe Quaker-style gown had been created by her mother, just as Lincoln\u2019s suit was.</p><p>In a huge rush, she whisked through her speech. \u201cResolved, that it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise,\u201d she concluded, curtsied and dashed from the stage.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a star,\u201d Kevin whispered.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that...\u201d Melanie whispered back, pleased despite herself.</p><p>One historical character after another appeared on the stage in a grand cavalcade that Melanie rather enjoyed. She kept sneaking glances at Kevin to see if he was bored, but if he was, he hid it. Not that she would feel guilty if he was\u2014he\u2019d invited himself when Angie had proudly told him of her role in the school performance.</p><p>Afterward the kids came from backstage, still in their costumes, to receive their parents\u2019 congratulations. Kevin swept Angie into an extravagant hug. \u201cKiddo, you were fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talked too fast, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Her anxious gaze sought her mother. \u201cI practiced talking really really slow, and then I could hear myself going fast. Was it awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKevin\u2019s right.\u201d Melanie hugged her, too. \u201cYou were great. Only a little bit fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The big brown eyes, so much like her father\u2019s, searched Melanie\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Melanie said firmly. \u201cIn fact, the whole performance was wonderful. I want to tell Mrs. Jensen so while you\u2019re changing.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter shuffled her feet. \u201cWell, um, a bunch of the girls are spending the night at Chelsea\u2019s. Can I, too?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>An instinctive protest rose to Melanie\u2019s tongue. With Angie away for the night, she wouldn\u2019t have the excuse of having to get home for the baby-sitter or not being able to ask Kevin in. She would have to tell the truth: I\u2019m not ready. Or, I need to know you love me.</p><p>Or, was it possible she\u2019d realize she was ready?</p><p>She stole a glance his way and saw he was waiting for her answer as much as her daughter was. His eyes had darkened, become intent; although he hadn\u2019t moved and was seemingly relaxed, she felt the difference, as if his sudden tension crackled through the air.</p><p>Melanie drew a deep breath. \u201cOf course you can, Angie. If\u2014\u201d she held up one hand \u201c\u2014it\u2019s okay with Chelsea\u2019s mother and this isn\u2019t something you girls have cooked up without asking.\u201d</p><p>But, no. She didn\u2019t get off so easily.</p><p>Chelsea\u2019s mom, a laid-back woman who worked at the U.S. Forest Service office, agreed that she\u2019d let Chelsea invite up to five other girls. \u201cThey won\u2019t be any problem, I promise. On the way home, we\u2019ll rent a video, and I\u2019ll order a pizza later, in case they get hungry. I can run Angie home around lunchtime, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need my toothbrush or anything,\u201d Angie assured her mother. \u201cI can just sleep in my T-shirt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It felt like a conspiracy. Melanie might have been suspicious if she\u2019d thought there was the slightest chance Kevin knew Chelsea\u2019s mom. But, in trying to get the girls organized and out to her van, she hardly seemed to notice him.</p><p>Left with him in the gymnasium as the crowd eddied out, Melanie said, \u201cWell.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been deserted.\u201d</p> <p>His narrowed eyes focused on her mouth. \u201cNot by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cShall we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Of course. They had no reason to wait. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Outside, under the yellow sodium lamps in the school parking lot, Melanie couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say. She waited while Kevin unlocked the four-by-four.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like snow,\u201d she surprised herself by announcing.</p><p>\u201cIt does,\u201d he agreed. \u201cWhere does Chelsea live? Will Angie be able to get home tomorrow if six inches falls?\u201d</p><p>What a nice man, she thought warmly. The last thing he must want was for her to dash across the parking lot and tell Angie, who was even now squeezing into Chelsea\u2019s van, that she couldn\u2019t spend the night, after all. Yet he was suggesting that very thing, if need be.</p><p>\u201cAngie could walk if she had to,\u201d Melanie said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that far, and she loves the snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He waited while she got in, then circled to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked whether you\u2019re a skier,\u201d he said as he settled behind the wheel.</p> <p>Grateful to have a topic\u2014any topic\u2014that wasn\u2019t emotionally loaded, Melanie chattered all the way to her house about the skiing lessons she\u2019d had when her father was stationed in Germany, including her crush on her instructor and the resulting improvement in her grasp of German.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d completely forgotten how to ski when I moved back here, but do you know, it must be like riding a bicycle, because it came back easily. Although I\u2019m no more than intermediate! The Olympic team won\u2019t be recruiting me.\u201d</p><p>He parked in her driveway and turned off the engine. Melanie tried to think of something else to say about her skiing ability and failed.</p><p>After a prolonged silence, Kevin said, \u201cShall I wish you good-night?\u201d</p><p>Crunch time. \u201cI...\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>So often, it seemed, important things were said when she couldn\u2019t see his face well enough to make out his expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me.\u201d He sounded grave.</p><p>\u201cI...want to.\u201d Suddenly she knew she meant it. She was still nervous, but she understood now that her heart didn\u2019t lack certainty. Her problem was that she felt like a teenager on the brink of her first time. It had been so long; would she know what to do? Would Kevin think her breasts were small? Would she please or disappoint him? Would she be disappointed, and discover she\u2019d built up a mere crush into the love of the century? \u201cThat is,\u201d she finished, a different kind of uncertainty overtaking her, \u201cif you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d His voice took on a rough cast. \u201cI want to.\u201d</p> <p>On the way up to the porch, she wondered with belated social anxiety what drinks she had available to offer him. The occasion seemed to call for wine. Hadn\u2019t her parents left a bottle on their last visit? She had a corkscrew; she knew she did.</p><p>Her fingers were shaking as she unlocked the front door and let them in. His felt remarkably steady when he reached up to unzip her parka and slip it off her shoulders.</p><p>Now she could see his face, and the hot glow in his eyes made her tremble.</p><p>She was going to offer him...something. Herself. No. A drink.</p><p>He tossed their parkas onto the back of the couch. Eyes never leaving hers, he took a step nearer, wrapped his hand around the back of her head and bent to kiss her.</p><p>All thought vanished. She only felt. The heat of his mouth, the thrust of his tongue, the strength of his hand, the solid wall of his body. Kissing him back felt like the most natural thing she\u2019d ever done. Groaning, he gripped her hips and pulled her tightly against him. She wound an ankle around his, tugged at his hair when he tried to lift his mouth from hers. They were both panting for breath when he nipped at her neck.</p><p>\u201cMy bedroom...\u201d</p><p>He yanked her turtleneck over her head. Pins fell and her hair tumbled to her shoulders. He growled something prayerful and buried his fingers in it. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>She was struggling to get his shirt off. She had it up to his armpits when she saw the livid scar on his flat belly. Her hands stilled, and he froze at the same moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d She sounded as shocked as she felt. She touched it lightly. \u201cYou never said. This looks new!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that new. It\u2019s been almost six months. I was shot.\u201d</p><p>Melanie let his shirt fall. \u201cBut...what happened?\u201d she repeated, feeling dense. He\u2019d been shot only six months ago and never said?</p><p>He let out a sound. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have told you. I did say something once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you asked if I missed my old life. I said I\u2019d tell you sometime about my last day as a park ranger.\u201d</p><p>She remembered the casual way he\u2019d said it, as if something absurd, not dead serious, had happened that last day.</p><p>Kevin reached for her. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think about it.\u201d</p><p>Melanie backed up a step, feeling the need for distance. \u201cYou must have realized I\u2019d see the scar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing I\u2019m hiding.\u201d He frowned, but more as if irritated at himself than at her. \u201cIt\u2019s why I left the Park Service. No, not why. Just the last straw. I\u2019m a naturalist, not a cop, but the public is destroying the parks. I came across a bunch of drunks partying somewhere they shouldn\u2019t have been, and when I asked them to pack it up, one of them pulled a gun and shot me. He\u2019s in prison now. I spent weeks in the hospital being fed by a tube, and I made the decision to get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were shot.\u201d She felt numb.</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He caught something in her tone. \u201cNo! Not because I was shot. Because my role was changing. Because it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suddenly decided you wanted to be a college professor.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her warily. \u201cThe opportunity came along and I grabbed it. Dammit, Melanie, what\u2019s wrong? Why is the fact that I was shot such a big deal here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you never told me!\u201d she flared. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t want to talk about it. Because life decisions made in the hospital after something like that happens may not be lasting ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means\u2014\u201d she hugged herself, conscious of her near-nakedness \u201c\u2014that you might end up missing what you had.\u201d It means that you might end up leaving Elk Springs. And me. \u201cMostly, it bothers me that while I was telling you everything I consider important about myself, you didn\u2019t mention that a bullet prompted your arrival in town.\u201d</p><p>Kevin swore. \u201cMelanie, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She should have been thrilled, not wondering whether that was one of those things men said at such a moment. \u201cThen\u2014\u201d she nodded at his stomach, covered by his shirt \u201c\u2014why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale pride?\u201d He let out a long breath and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cThat, and\u2014\u201d he grimaced \u201c\u2014I guess I didn\u2019t want you to think just what you\u2019re thinking now. That this was impulsive. That I\u2019ll recover and realize I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, it never would have occurred to me...then.\u201d She imbued the one word with significance. \u201cNow, I have to wonder if you aren\u2019t the one who\u2019s starting to think you were impulsive.\u201d</p><p>Kevin took a quick step toward her. \u201cMelanie, this isn\u2019t what matters. It\u2019s how you feel about me, and how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess\u2014\u201d she hugged herself harder \u201c\u2014that\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p><p>Somehow his arms were around her again, his warmth enveloping her. \u201cIt scares you that I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt scares me that you\u2019re who you are and not...\u201d</p><p>His muscles tightened. \u201cA local yokel who owns his own construction business?\u201d</p><p>She went stiff in his embrace. \u201cThat\u2019s right. A man with roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part matters to you?\u201d He was suddenly angry, and could she blame him? \u201cMy roots? Or who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispered, \u201cof course. But...\u201d</p><p>His jaw flexed. \u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Her hands fluttered. She was trying very hard to cover her cleavage, exposed by her laciest bra. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought I was ready, but I\u2019m not. This is my fault for...for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeading me on?\u201d His laugh was harsh. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. We both wanted to be here. But I suspect you\u2019re right. You\u2019re not the only one who needs to do some thinking.\u201d</p><p>Why did that hurt? She didn\u2019t let herself figure that out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as well that...something stopped us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tossed her turtleneck to her. She clutched it to her bosom like a maidenly spinster. Kevin\u2019s voice softened marginally. \u201cGood night, Melanie.\u201d He stepped forward, kissed her lightly on the mouth and left.</p><p>She wondered if she would hear from him again.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>THE KNOCK on his office door brought Kevin\u2019s head up. He wrote \u201cA\u2014excellent\u201d in red pen, his handwriting slashing across the top of the paper he\u2019d just read. Others were spread across his desk.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he called.</p><p>His visitor was unexpected. The president of the college, a vigorous sandy-haired man, opened the door. \u201cKevin. I\u2019m glad to catch you. I have someone here I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d</p><p>At only forty, John Hunnisett was young to have the position. Formerly the director of admissions at a private university, he\u2019d been brought in just this past year, word had it, to make major changes. Since the ski area had opened at Juanita Butte, Elk Springs had grown at a tumultuous rate, the college alongside the town. Hunnisett had recruited not just Kevin but other new faculty members aggressively, while some tenured professors were being eased out.</p><p>Kevin rose to his feet behind his desk. \u201cJohn, good to see you.\u201d</p><p>A gray-haired, stocky man with shrewd eyes followed John Hunnisett into Kevin\u2019s spare office.</p><p>\u201cRoger Sterling,\u201d he said, shaking Kevin\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m at the University of Oregon. I\u2019ve heard good things about your teaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Kevin said warily. \u201cHave a seat. What brings you here?\u201d</p><p>Sterling sat, crossed his legs and said straight out, \u201cWe\u2019re discussing ways to offer four-year degrees from the university here in Elk Springs. For the moment, just in a few departments. As you know, we\u2019ve already begun in Education. Another area that interests us is yours. Tell me how feasible you think it would be to expand the Forestry and Park Management programs into a four-year major.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two men left half an hour later, their purpose accomplished. They wanted Kevin to design the program, become chairman of the department, consult on hiring colleagues. They wanted him to become tenured, instead of temporary.</p><p>They wanted to tie him down.</p><p>After their departure, he automatically graded another paper. \u201cB\u2014competent but could have been more thoughtful. See comments.\u201d It had taken all his concentration to make it through one five-page paper. He couldn\u2019t face another. Setting down his pen, he shoved back his chair.</p><p>He\u2019d had only morning classes today; it was still barely one o\u2019clock. Kevin felt a sudden desperate need to be out-of-doors. The walls were closing in.</p> <p>Within an hour he left his vehicle at the trailhead to Puma Lake, swung a day pack over his shoulder and strode past the wooden sign that said \u201cPuma Lake 2.3 miles.\u201d A good eight inches of snow had fallen up here this past week, but eager cross-country skiers, snowshoers and hikers had worn the snow from the trail. It climbed sharply between tall stands of ponderosa pines, then dropped over a ridge toward the lake, a chilly blue-gray under snow-heavy skies. His stride was that of a man accustomed to covering miles in a day. His breath came out in clouds, his arms swung freely.</p><p>As always, his thoughts untangled out here in the wilderness and solitude. Okay, he was being pushed to make a decision sooner than he\u2019d expected to have to, but was that a bad thing? He should feel flattered that, after only one quarter of classes, feedback should be so good on his teaching. He had to work; he was finding he was good at this. So why not?</p><p>Now he had a solid future to offer Melanie, too. The other night, as she\u2019d clutched that turtleneck to her breasts and stared at him with huge panicky eyes, he\u2019d almost asked her to marry him. But what could he say? I don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll be next year, but I want you with me? Romantic, but not what she wanted to hear right now.</p><p>It would mean resigning from the National Park Service once and for all. Knowing he was on a leave of absence only had felt like a safety valve. He could recuperate, try a new life but know his old one was still open to him. He imagined himself sitting down to write that letter of resignation. Visiting one of the national parks that had been his old stomping grounds, driving in and paying his fee like all the tourists in their RVs, staying on the marked paths, seeing old friends and having nothing to say.</p><p>Reaching the lakeshore, he paused and listened to the silence. How often would he find himself alone in a place like this again? Puma Lake would be surrounded by families picnicking most of the year. How often would he have the time to seek solitude?</p> <p>Frowning, he set out again with his ground-eating stride to circle the small lake. He actually felt short of breath, which irritated him. He still hadn\u2019t recovered, had been too sedentary. He needed to add some miles to his daily run. Push himself.</p><p>Maybe it was too soon to make a decision. Sure, Melanie wanted to stay in Elk Springs, but if she loved him, she would go if that\u2019s where his heart led, wouldn\u2019t she? He could see how the school year went, how hemmed in and confined he felt.</p><p>He could ask Melanie to marry him and find out whether she had balked the other night because of fear about who he was\u2014or because she didn\u2019t really love him.</p><p>Kevin drew a deep cold breath and blew it out in a frigid stream. His lungs seemed to expand now that he\u2019d let himself off the hook. Not that long ago he\u2019d been lying in a hospital bed. Melanie had accused him of doubting his own motives. Maybe she was right; maybe she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d given himself a year to decide what he wanted for the future. Take it, he told himself. Be sure.</p><p>WHEN HE CALLED Melanie that night, he got only her answering machine. Kevin hung up without leaving a message. He wondered if she was screening her calls because she didn\u2019t want to hear from him, or whether she wasn\u2019t home. The idea that she might have gone out with another man made him grind his teeth.</p> <p>Dammit, this was the trouble with dating a single mother. He couldn\u2019t come by in the evening for a serious talk\u2014Angie would be around. Okay, how about after his last class tomorrow? No, he had several students scheduled for appointments, and by the time he was done with them, Angie would be home from school. Thursday at Angie\u2019s soccer practice. Hell, they\u2019d decided not to hold practice this week, the weather was getting so cold. Sunday was the last game of the season.</p><p>He still hadn\u2019t made up his mind how to approach Melanie when fate intervened the next day. He was crossing the quad when he heard her name mentioned by a pair of coeds going in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201c...speaker today. Melanie Parker. She\u2019s bringing historical costumes. She\u2019s supposed to be really entertaining.\u201d</p><p>Kevin spun around and trailed the girls. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said.</p><p>They turned to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing your conversation. Melanie Parker is speaking on campus today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s open.\u201d The coed flushed.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re not a student, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m an instructor here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s talking to my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which class would that be?\u201d He spoke with eroding patience.</p><p>\u201cOh. World History 102.\u201d</p><p>He extracted the remaining details from her. Time, building, classroom. He\u2019d have to cancel one meeting, but to hell with it. Jason Bernard was trying to plea-bargain for a higher grade than he\u2019d earned last quarter, but Kevin had already turned in his grades, and even if he hadn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t have changed Jason\u2019s.</p><p>At two o\u2019clock, he strolled into the back of one of the auditorium-style classrooms, where the larger survey classes were held. Students were still settling into seats and whispering. Up front, Melanie was laying out garments, presumably so that she could reach them easily later. The moment he saw her, he felt pleasure and relief and frustration. Why did this one woman exert such a pull?</p><p>Her hands were slim, quick-moving, competent, her neck long and graceful. Her every move was sure, contained; she didn\u2019t toss her hair or laugh or fidget when nervous. She had a quality of...stillness, or perhaps, serenity.</p><p>Solved, Kevin thought wryly: the mystery of why she attracted him so greatly. In her very being, Melanie possessed the one quality he had spent his life seeking.</p><p>He made his way down the side of the auditorium until he found a pillar where he could lean inconspicuously but was close enough to see and hear her well.</p><p>She never did spot him as she gave a forty-five-minute presentation that held the students enthralled. Her point, not surprisingly, was that fashion reflected both culture and life on a nitty-gritty level. She stripped to a hideous undergarment, causing a stir in the auditorium, and had two girls from the front row manhandle her into a corset and tie it tightly enough to create the wisp of a waist Victorians sought. Then she showed how the corset and hoops affected her mobility, how, in essence, the garments forced her to behave with the propriety considered the ideal. The fingerless gloves often seen in photos were to keep hands warm in inadequately heated houses, she told them, describing how the lower classes who did have to work dressed.</p><p>Kevin found her talk as fascinating as the students apparently did. Creating Halloween costumes was the least of her skills, he saw. He imagined her taking her show on the road, perhaps filming educational videos, creating similar presentations on ancient Greece or Egypt or the Druids. It wouldn\u2019t matter so much then if she had a home base....</p><p>Kevin was honest enough with himself to recognize when he was being self-serving. Yeah, if she agreed to marry him and he went back to the Park Service or took up another essentially nomadic career, he and she could talk about ways she could refocus what she did. But don\u2019t kid yourself, he thought grimly; Melanie likes her life here. She was not going to jump at the idea of doing presentations around the country and announce that really she wanted to sell her house and hit the road.</p><p>He waited until the professor\u2019s offer to help her pack up had been refused, until the last students were exiting the auditorium. Then he stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cYou were great.\u201d</p><p>Melanie started, a pair of lace fingerless gloves dropping from her hands. \u201cOh! You were here?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell if she was happy to see him or dismayed. \u201cSaw the whole performance.\u201d</p><p>Pink suffusing her cheeks, she bent her head and went back to packing the Victorian garments into suitcases. \u201cDo you think the students got anything out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou brought history alive,\u201d Kevin said, meaning it. \u201cThey learned more today than they will the rest of the quarter.\u201d</p><p>She stole a glance at him. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you. To apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize?\u201d Melanie didn\u2019t look up this time.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not being honest.\u201d He moved restlessly, not liking the feeling of being in the wrong. \u201cWithout thinking it through, I knew you preferred the idea of my being settled here in Elk Springs, being a college instructor, instead of on temporary leave from the Park Service. So...there were things I didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>She carefully folded a black gown. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re on? Temporary leave?\u201d</p><p>Inwardly he cursed; he hadn\u2019t meant to tell her that way. Hadn\u2019t meant to imply that he was still considering going back.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yes, but only in the bureaucratic sense. I didn\u2019t submit my resignation for all the reasons you mentioned the other night. I wanted to be sure I wasn\u2019t making the decision impulsively. I gave myself a year to think about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is that year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t expect to meet someone like you, certainly not right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like me?\u201d She sounded distinctly cool.</p><p>Hell, he was going about this all wrong. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to fall in love.\u201d</p><p>She stopped what she was doing at last and met his eyes. \u201cAre you so sure that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>Anger sparked. \u201cHave I given you that much reason to doubt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Melanie said, \u201cof course not. You\u2019ve been nice to Angie.\u201d</p><p>A door at the top of the auditorium opened. Kevin cast a frustrated glance up, but no one had come in.</p><p>Feeling pressured, he forged on. \u201cI want you to marry me. Will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kevin.\u201d Terrible sadness sounded in her voice. \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t asked. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His tone was aggressive. Talons of fear tore at his chest from the inside.</p><p>\u201cYou know why. I swore I\u2019d raise Angie here in Elk Springs, give her the life I didn\u2019t have. I married someone once who wasn\u2019t...wasn\u2019t settled. How can I make the same mistake again, just because I\u2019m...\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalling in love,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>Relief didn\u2019t join his other emotions. He knew better. Instead, he swore. \u201cYou love me, I love you, but you won\u2019t marry me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d she cried, eyes brimming with tears.</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t the only thing that matters, you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was the most important,\u201d he said bitterly.</p><p>Grief formed lines on her face, killing the serenity he so admired. \u201cI made a vow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll hurt both of us to keep it.\u201d He squeezed his eyes shut. \u201cThink about what you\u2019re doing, Melanie.

His anger and frustration were too great for him to give a damn that she might be left in an awkward position.</p><p>They were even too great for him to admit that he\u2019d blown it, that he shouldn\u2019t have asked. Not like that, not then.</p><p>So why in hell had he done it? Someone else looking in might suggest he\u2019d sabotaged his chances on purpose.</p> <p>He swore softly as he stalked outside.</p><p>Had part of him wanted the answer he\u2019d gotten?</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>SHE\u2019D KNOWN he was too stubborn a man to leave things alone. Melanie preferred to think that way\u2014of him as stubborn\u2014than to believe he loved her too deeply to accept her refusal.</p><p>A lead weight had lain on her chest since he\u2019d proposed. He was everything\u2014almost\u2014that she had dreamed of finding. Kind, tender, patient, sexy, even good with her daughter.</p><p>Everything but honest, a glowing kernel of anger reminded her. Everything but the settled resident of Elk Springs he\u2019d led her to believe he was.</p> <p>She\u2019d told him from the beginning what she was determined to have for herself and for Angie, and instead of being similarly honest, he\u2019d lied by omission. He had made her fall in love with him, knowing the whole while that he had more in common with her ex-husband than he did with her ideal. If he was hurt, he deserved to be, she told herself.</p><p>Her own hurt...well, perhaps she deserved it, too, for being so blind to the many hints Kevin had dropped, for her foolish trust.</p><p>The very next day she was cutting out an Edwardian-style gown from pale peach silk when the doorbell to her business entrance rang. Instantly, in her bones, she knew it was him. She was very tempted not to answer it. Pull in her head like a turtle.</p><p>But he\u2019d be back of course. Why not get it over with? She refused to think that she might be hoping he could change her mind, that he would announce he\u2019d bought a house, resigned from the Park Service, that he would do anything, be anything, if only she would be his. She wouldn\u2019t believe it if he did say all that. People didn\u2019t change so easily.</p><p>When she opened the door, Kevin stood on the small side porch, hands shoved in the pockets of his parka, his russet hair disheveled. Behind him, the sky was gray and cold, promising snow that had yet to fall this winter in Elk Springs.</p><p>She\u2019d known it would be him, and yet still she felt a ripple of purely sexual response to his presence.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d he asked, creases seemingly worn overnight between his brows. \u201cDon\u2019t say no. Please. I just need to understand.\u201d</p><p>Wordlessly Melanie stood aside, letting him pass her, his big body so close she smelled aftershave and the chill of the air.</p> <p>He walked to her sewing table and touched the silk. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured, then turned to face her. \u201cLike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m far from beautiful,\u201d Melanie said uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m...rather ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me.\u201d His voice had the texture of sandpaper. \u201cTell me why you won\u2019t take a chance on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you.\u201d She didn\u2019t move from her stance by the door. Her hands were squeezed together painfully. \u201cFrom the very beginning I told you. I\u2019ve spent my whole life never belonging anywhere. I will not live that way again, and I won\u2019t do that to Angie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour childhood was so unhappy?\u201d Kevin asked in that same voice, the one that would have scraped her palms if she could have grasped it.</p><p>\u201cUnhappy?\u201d Strangely, she felt taken aback.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely. Of course not. But I hated the moves\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cWere your parents happy? Did they love each other? You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...yes,\u201d she whispered, then repeated more strongly. \u201cYes. They were excited about a transfer. A new place. Sacramento? They talked about day trips to gold-rush ghost towns and the Sierra Mountains. Germany? The Alps, the Rhine, beer fests.\u201d The child in her still resented the sparkle in her mother\u2019s voice as she\u2019d tried to coax her eldest daughter to share their anticipation. Yet the adult Melanie couldn\u2019t help reluctantly seeing Kevin\u2019s point: that perhaps she was blanking out the happy times and focusing entirely on her childish fear of the unknown, her certainty that she would never make a new friend. She continued, \u201cI\u2019m glad I saw the Alps and skied at Squaw Valley. But I would have traded all our adventures for the chance to grow up feeling secure, knowing I\u2019d have a best friend to whisper with at school, that if I got lost...\u201d She stopped, knowing how nonsensical that sounded.</p><p>\u201cKnowing I wouldn\u2019t get lost just walking home.\u201d</p><p>Of course, he heard what she hadn\u2019t finished saying. \u201cYou did get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In... I don\u2019t remember where.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to remember, had never even asked her mother about the episode. \u201cAll I know is, nobody spoke English and a strange man was following me, and...\u201d She had been terrified. \u201cI had bad dreams for years.\u201d</p><p>A frown gathered on his brow. \u201cYou won\u2019t marry me because you had nightmares as a child about being lost in a strange place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That isn\u2019t why I won\u2019t marry you!\u201d He was deliberately misunderstanding. \u201cYou lied to me. How can I marry a man I can\u2019t trust?\u201d</p><p>Kevin swore. \u201cMelanie, I will never lie to you again. I wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have,\u201d she said starkly.</p><p>\u201cGive me a chance.\u201d</p><p>How she ached to do just that! To gamble that he would never lie again, would try to make her happy.</p><p>\u201cA chance to do what?\u201d she asked, just above a whisper. \u201cTake me to dinner again? Or put a wedding ring on my finger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we at least keep seeing each other?\u201d He was begging and, typically for a man, was angry to have to be. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make decisions about the future now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is certainly your preference.\u201d Hearing her own waspish voice, Melanie wished she could snatch back the spiteful remark, make it unsaid. That had been her anger speaking.</p><p>Kevin stalked toward her, his face darkening. \u201cDammit, Melanie!\u201d he said between clenched teeth. \u201cIs considering a change of career in your thirties evidence of instability? Unreliability? You seem to have found your vocation rather late in life for you to be sneering at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean...\u201d Melanie faltered.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cI suggest you watch yourself. You\u2019re going to stifle your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Her chin shot up in outrage. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare criticize how I choose to raise my child.\u201d</p><p>Still in that silky voice, he said, \u201cIs that what I would have gotten as her stepfather, too? Butt out?\u201d</p><p>Actually she\u2019d thought how wonderful it would be to have someone like him to consult, to offer another perspective, to lean on those days when parenting was so terribly lonely. But her temper wouldn\u2019t let her admit it.</p><p>\u201cIf I thought you were the man I wanted to marry, I would have trusted you to be Angie\u2019s father. So the point is moot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He visibly flinched, a muscle jerking in his cheek.</p><p>Shame cooled her anger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She made herself say it. \u201cThat was cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been good to Angie.\u201d</p><p>Her throat closed. \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Kevin reached out and gripped her arms. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if she was saying goodbye to any chance of romance or marriage. The man she\u2019d thought she wanted wouldn\u2019t be Kevin. Could she really promise forever to someone kind and steady, who liked to stay home evenings and watch football, who probably had a paunch and no curiosity about the world beyond the Elk Springs city limits? No. After Kevin...no.</p><p>She was weakening and knew it. Deliberately she remembered one apartment where she\u2019d lived with Ryan. The cockroaches and the freezer that incessantly needed defrosting, and the neighbors who had angry visitors at strange hours. The elementary school down the street with graffiti-covered walls and no grass.</p><p>Or the last move, when she\u2019d just painted the kitchen a soft lemon yellow and made curtains. But Ryan had come home, grinned triumphantly and announced, \u201cI\u2019m on my way up, baby!\u201d and they\u2019d had to pack everything they owned that night. The twelve-hour drive with Angie crying in the back seat and Melanie with no idea where they\u2019d sleep that night or what the new apartment would look like.</p><p>Kevin saw both her weakening and her ultimate decision on her face, because he let out a low animal sound and pulled her to him. His kiss was desperate, hungry.</p><p>She melted into the kiss, grasping the front of his parka to hold on as her knees buckled. Anger and regret seemed to have burned away the restraint that had kept their kisses polite. Now his tongue forced its way into her mouth, and she tangled it with hers.</p><p>For one moment Kevin lifted his head. His eyes were nearly black, his skin seeming to be stretched taut across his cheekbones, his whole face blazing with intensity. \u201cI need you,\u201d he said in a raw voice that made her tremble inside. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to us, Melanie.\u201d</p><p>Her every nerve ending was alive. She could not seem to pull back from him, though the hard thrust of his body against her belly made his desire plain.</p><p>Heaven help her, but she needed him, too, if only this once. \u201cI want you,\u201d she managed, though tremulously. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you, but...I do want you.\u201d</p><p>Another guttural sound, and he\u2019d lifted her onto the sewing table and laid her back on the peach silk. A pin pricked her, but it felt unimportant, nothing compared to the hands lifting her shirt and unfastening her bra to free her breasts. Nothing compared to the hard smooth wall of his chest beneath her palms as she slid them under his sweater. Nothing compared to his hot urgent mouth, to the way her thighs parted to urge him closer.</p><p>His mouth on her breast was another sensation of such clarity that she wondered dizzily if she had ever really felt sexual need before. Her back arched and she made muffled sounds that should have embarrassed her. She was the one tugging at his buckle, trying frantically to free him from his jeans, though he still wore his parka.</p><p>Perhaps he had more presence of mind than she did, because he pulled back long enough to shed some clothes and to peel her jeans from her legs. For a moment she was chilled and her knees clenched together; what was she doing, desperately trying to couple with a man on her cutting table? On top of a precious bolt of shot silk? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the moment he ripped his sweater over his head and she saw his bare chest and shoulders, pale red-gold hair shimmering against an expanse of tanned skin, muscles moving smoothly beneath, the rush of sexual heat seared her inhibitions. Once he put his mouth against her calf, kissed and nipped and then trailed it higher, she lost any last ability to resist.</p><p>With a moan, she parted her legs again, silk fisted in her hands at her sides, and begged him to...no, not kiss her there, not this time. This time, she wanted him inside her.</p><p>He must have been carrying condoms, because suddenly he was putting one on with shaking hands. Then he rose over her, blocking out the world. Her fingernails bit into his shoulders as he thrust, a long slide that stretched her in ways she\u2019d forgotten, or never experienced, she didn\u2019t know. She only knew that having him buried inside her was painful and exquisite, and she didn\u2019t want him to leave, even to pull back. He smothered her protests with kisses and pulled away only to surge deep inside her again. And again and again, until her body convulsed in pleasure so intense she understood at last why this moment was called \u201cthe little death.\u201d</p><p>She held Kevin as he moved a final time, as he groaned and she felt the ripples deep inside her. For a timeless moment, Melanie floated in a blissful sea of physical satisfaction, of tenderness, of love.</p> <p>And then another pin pricked her hip, and this time she felt it, so sharp she knew it had drawn blood.</p><p>Just as she knew nothing had changed. She couldn\u2019t let it\u2014not for her sake, and not for Angie\u2019s.</p><p>But for just a few more minutes she could revel in his weight on her, his warmth, the slam of his heartbeat, the way he murmured her name. For just a few more minutes she could pretend that this was the first time.</p><p>Not the only time.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p> <p>HIS CROSS-COUNTRY SKIS whispered on the snow. His rasp of breath was the only sound in a world cloaked in white. No, not entirely. To one side, a whirr made him turn his head in time to glimpse a flash of brilliant blue wings against the white and deep-green backdrop.</p><p>Scott had recommended this trail, a long easy rise to a ridge where, he promised, Kevin would see the valley and the town of Elk Springs spread out below him. Kevin had canceled his morning classes and counted on being alone.</p><p>His muscles ached pleasantly, his lungs expanded to take in deep drafts of cold air. Another sound, and he saw the brown rump of a deer bounding away at the sight of him. This was where he was happiest\u2014alone, in the woods. His mother used to shake her head and swear he would have been one of those unshaven mountain men if he\u2019d been born in another century. He\u2019d thought she might be right. He had never needed other people in the way even Scott had.</p><p>The idea of \u201cother people\u201d skimmed Kevin\u2019s mind, took form and face, a tumble of dark hair, passion-clouded eyes, soft mouth, breasts as white as snow. Kevin gritted his teeth and tried to wall her out. In this solitude he could unclutter his mind, understand what was most important to him.</p><p>Of course he instantly saw Melanie again, this time as she told him with quiet finality that no matter what had just happened, she still couldn\u2019t marry him. She didn\u2019t even know if it was a good idea to keep seeing him.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d she had said, in a small husky voice that cracked. \u201cI\u2019m so tempted to let myself love you and forget what it might mean. Maybe Ryan and I would have stayed happy if I hadn\u2019t hated our life so much. Maybe I soured our marriage with my unhappiness. I won\u2019t go through that again. I won\u2019t, Kevin. Don\u2019t ask me.\u201d</p> <p>Trying to leave the memory behind, he skied faster, planting the poles with vicious stabs, driving himself in a near sprint. He wanted to be angry, contemptuous of a woman who wouldn\u2019t take risks. But how could he? They\u2019d had great sex. Okay. Otherwise, all he was offering her was an open-ended future that must read to her like a rerun of her first marriage. He\u2019d said it himself: Park Service housing was often pretty seedy. It was usually miles from the nearest town, making a long bus ride for schoolchildren. Friendships evaporated the moment you were reassigned.</p><p>It was the perfect life for a man who craved solitude, shunned commitment, cared more about the health of an acre of forest than why his neighbor suddenly looked hungover every morning and why only one car was now parked in their driveway.</p><p>It was the worst possible life for a woman who craved community, longed for ties of friendship and family, wanted neighbors who knew one another\u2019s business.</p><p>They were what they were. Clearly not meant for each other.</p><p>Kevin was racing now, muscles burning, his breath near sobs. He was where he loved to be. This was all he needed. Anguish filled his chest. Slamming pulse, lungs frantically snatching at oxygen. Heart breaking.</p><p>He burst from the trees. A last steep crest covered with new-fallen snow lay before him, a sky as huge and achingly blue as any he\u2019d ever seen arching above it. Making a crosshatch with his skis, leaving behind V prints, he climbed with scarcely broken stride. This was what he needed. All he needed. All he\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>With a harsh cry he topped the ridge and saw the spectacular sweep of country beyond. The high desert land, dusted with snow far below him, stretched as far as his eye could see, broken only by the meandering Deschutes River and the new\u2014in geologic terms\u2014lava cones that made the soil rust red.</p><p>And by the town sprawled below the forested foothills. Elk Springs.</p> <p>His gaze didn\u2019t hunt for the horizon or study the petite lava cones that looked like scoops of ice cream dumped on the flat landscape. He was too busy seeking out familiar landmarks. His gaze didn\u2019t pause at the community-college grounds above town, the high school on the other side, the redbrick public-safety building where his brother\u2019s wife was chief of police. There, that stretch of green, was where he and Melanie had walked along the river at night, where he had kissed her. He couldn\u2019t make out individual houses, but he found her neighborhood, her street.</p><p>Always before, when he drove into town\u2014any town\u2014for groceries, on the way back to the park he would leave behind with relief the last stoplight. He\u2019d shake his head and wonder why anyone would want to live there.</p><p>Today, for the first time in his life, he looked down on a town and saw home. He stared until his eyes burned and he had to blink hard.</p><p>Would living in that old house with Melanie be so bad? She had a big yard with bird feeders and a tire swing\u2014he remembered with fondness a tire swing his father had hung from an old elm that had probably long since been felled by disease. He had always wanted a dog, something that wasn\u2019t possible when you worked in the national parks. He had a feeling Angie would back him on that one.</p><p>He could commit to setting up the four-year program at the college. Kevin admitted to himself that he was getting a kick out of teaching. And he\u2019d always enjoyed the challenge of planning new displays or programs. When this one was up and running like clockwork...well, that was years away. Maybe he\u2019d still be content. Maybe Melanie would be willing to consider a move then, when Angie was grown or nearly so.</p><p>Leaning on his poles, Kevin bowed his head. His solitude and the wilderness weren\u2019t enough anymore. Every time he went hiking or cross-country skiing, he wished Melanie was with him.</p><p>And Angie. He wanted to be a father to the kid, the kind of father she\u2019d never had. He could tell she had liked it when he helped coach her soccer team. She\u2019d never given any sign of resenting him.</p><p>Lifting his head, Kevin looked down at Elk Springs, spread beneath him like a topographic map he could touch. His heart swelling in his chest, he wished he was there and not at a dreamlike distance looking on.</p><p>Right this minute it seemed to him that was what he\u2019d spent a lifetime doing: looking on as other people lived. Maybe that was what his discontentment this past couple of years had been about. Not the abuse of the wilderness by the great American public, but his own loneliness. Maybe he hadn\u2019t wanted to know why his neighbor was hungover, hadn\u2019t wanted to talk about the wife who had gone for good, because if he looked too closely, he\u2019d see himself: someone who came home to an empty soulless house at night, who preferred a canopy of stars because it had a glory his own life lacked.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d come to Elk Springs looking for more than space to think, a clearing to rest his head at night for a while. Maybe he\u2019d been looking for home.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he realized sooner that he had found exactly what he needed and wanted most?</p><p>With sudden decision, Kevin swung his skis back the way he\u2019d come and shoved off, crouching to take advantage of the steep downward slope. He hadn\u2019t quite figured out how to convince Melanie of his change of heart\u2014but he couldn\u2019t wait to start trying.</p><p>MELANIE CLANGED the lid back onto the garbage can. She could have hand-washed the crumpled stained silk\u2014but she didn\u2019t want to. Discarding it felt symbolic, as if she had put into the garbage can her own foolishness, as well as a bolt of fabric.</p><p>Hurrying back into the house she\u2019d thought was still empty, she bumped right into Angie.</p><p>\u201cOomph!\u201d Holding her daughter up, Melanie staggered against a kitchen chair. \u201cOh, my gracious! I\u2019m sorry! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Angie blinked. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home from school.\u201d Brilliant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three-thirty,\u201d the eight-year-old pointed out with irrefutable logic.</p><p>\u201cIs it really?\u201d Her gaze went to the clock on the stove. \u201cThe day\u2019s flown.\u201d Liar, liar, pants on fire. Actually the day had crept on hands and knees. She had started cutting out the Edwardian dress for a customer, using a lemon-yellow silk, instead. Her concentration had been so poor she\u2019d made several mistakes that wasted fabric and twice stabbed herself with pins, bleeding on the silk, besides. It was a relief to call it quits.</p><p>Angie dropped her book bag on a chair and headed for the refrigerator. \u201cIs Kevin coming to dinner?\u201d she asked, taking out the milk. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been here all week.\u201d</p><p>Put on the spot, Melanie was tempted to hedge. She\u2019d been trying in vain to think of some way of broaching the subject. Or perhaps she simply hadn\u2019t wanted to put into words a failure as great as her marriage.</p><p>Instead, she said honestly, \u201cI\u2019m...not sure I\u2019ll be seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>Angie spun around. Milk splattered. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spilling,\u201d Melanie said automatically. \u201cAnd I decided not to keep seeing him because he probably won\u2019t be in Elk Springs next year, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in Angie\u2019s eyes. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he want to take us with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake us...?\u201d Melanie\u2019s breath whooshed out and she went to her daughter, gently taking the milk from her. \u201cOh, honey.\u201d Melanie tried to enfold her in a hug.</p><p>Angie jerked back, glaring through her tears. \u201cI thought you\u2019d marry him! I thought he\u2019d be my dad!\u201d</p><p>Melanie swallowed, a lump in her throat. \u201cKevin\u2019s job means he moves a lot. Every couple of years. You know he was a park ranger, and he\u2019s thinking of going back to that. If he does, he\u2019ll always be living out in the middle of nowhere. You\u2019d have long bus rides to school and maybe no friends your age as neighbors, and I\u2019d have to give up my business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d Pain and rebellion in every line of her thin body, Angie evaded another attempt to hug her. \u201cHe told me all about the places he\u2019s been. They\u2019re so cool! I want to leave Elk Springs. I hate Elk Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do mean it! I do! I want to go with Kevin!\u201d Bursting into tears, Angie ran from the room.</p><p>Melanie stood in the middle of the kitchen, listening to her daughter\u2019s feet thunder up the stairs. She felt more inadequate than she ever had in her life, even when she\u2019d realized that Ryan didn\u2019t want the home she was trying to make.</p> <p>Sinking into a straight-backed kitchen chair, she buried her face in her hands. Why hadn\u2019t she foreseen this? Angie had never really had a father. Of course she\u2019d fallen in love with Kevin! How could she help it, when he had always been willing to include her, always treated her like an equal, had even done something as special as helping coach her soccer team.</p><p>Angie just didn\u2019t understand what they would both be giving up if her mom married Kevin. She didn\u2019t remember much from before the divorce. Always feeling rootless\u2014she had no idea what that was like. How important it was to know where you belonged.</p><p>Melanie knew she should let her daughter cry, wait until a cooler moment. Her own tears crowded her eyelids, as they had all day. But she couldn\u2019t let Angie mourn by herself upstairs, while she sat here at the kitchen table feeling more alone than she had in years. Alone and scared and hollow.</p><p>Using a paper towel to scrub away the dampness on her cheeks, she went slowly upstairs. She let her hand slide along the banister. When, as a child, she visited Nana, she\u2019d often slid down the banister. She suspected Angie did, too. The walnut was polished from a hundred years of hands and bottoms, wearing it to a fine patina.</p><p>Family photographs hung along the staircase. At the bottom, Nana\u2019s parents, posing with a Model T Ford, her mother wrapped in fur, little guessing what the Great Depression would bring. Nana as a girl, eyes big and solemn, and as a young woman with her first teaching job.</p> <p>The years passed as Melanie climbed, the silky wood trailing beneath her fingertips.</p><p>Granddad, fine in his wedding suit. A few steps up hung the photo of him in front of his first store. Then the two together, bowed by the years, but proud in front of this house, bought in the early years of their marriage. Their daughter, baby pictures to wedding pictures. Melanie herself, as well as her much younger sister. And finally, Angie.</p><p>This house was their history, Melanie thought sadly. Her daughter\u2019s and hers. So why tonight did Nana seem to look back at her with reproach? Why was it so obvious that the photographs could be hung anywhere, that she, Melanie, took her memories and her heritage with her wherever she went?</p><p>She knocked on the door to Angie\u2019s bedroom. A small voice said, \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Melanie bit her lip. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>She took the silence for assent and opened the door. Angie had flung herself down on her four-poster, face in her pillow.</p> <p>Melanie sat beside her and gently rubbed her back. \u201cMaybe I made the wrong choice,\u201d she said sadly, \u201cbut I\u2019ve told you before how much I hated moving. I never had a friend longer than three years, until I came home to Elk Springs. I didn\u2019t want that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he could be my dad.\u201d Angie said through her tears. \u201cI\u2019m good at making friends. I wouldn\u2019t mind new friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis house...\u201d</p><p>With sudden passion, Angie rolled over, her body stiff. \u201cYou always said people are what\u2019s important. Not things.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s tears began to fall, hot and slow. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you can\u2019t marry him just so he can be my dad. Not if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but she did want to!</p><p>\u201cMy work...\u201d</p> <p>Her daughter squeezed her hand and said, voice tentative, \u201cCouldn\u2019t you keep making clothes and sell them somewhere? Or...or keep renting them, like you do now, but have someone else do it?\u201d</p><p>Could she afford to pay overhead on a shop that wasn\u2019t connected to her house? And someone\u2019s salary? And who could she trust long-distance?</p><p>Suddenly she was thinking. It might be possible. Or what if she started a catalog, something she\u2019d given passing thought to. Might there be other Park Service wives who\u2019d be interested in working for her?</p><p>\u201cI like walking to the bakery on Saturday mornings.\u201d Knowing how dumb that sounded, she said it, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s forehead crinkled. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to walk somewhere different?\u201d</p><p>No. That was the trouble. She wanted the familiar, not the new. She hadn\u2019t an adventurous bone in her body. But...might she be willing to walk somewhere different, to take the chance that it would become familiar, if the right person was beside her?</p><p>The answer was so obvious she knew her foolishness wasn\u2019t safely stowed with the ruined silk in the garbage can.</p><p>People were what mattered. Love was what bound her to her daughter and her parents and grandparents and their parents before them. This house...had been a refuge. She did love it, but it couldn\u2019t hold her, make her laugh, dry her tears, smile at her in the morning and bed her with passion at night. No house could give Angie what she needed.</p><p>Melanie had hated moving so often, both as a child and as a young wife. But would she have been so unhappy if Ryan had been different? If he had come home eagerly, played with his daughter, helped paint each new apartment? If instead of being impatient and irritated, wanting only to hang out with his new teammates, he had teased her and helped with the moves? If he had truly loved her, and she him?</p><p>If he had been Kevin?</p><p>\u201cWith Kevin,\u201d Melanie said softly to Angie, \u201cI might like walking anywhere at all.\u201d</p><p>The dawning joy in her daughter\u2019s eyes matched her own. \u201cThen...you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>Fear still gripped her heart, but a shaky smile showed itself. \u201cYes. Yes,\u201d she said wonderingly. \u201cI think I have.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>ANGIE HAD A FRIEND over, so Melanie didn\u2019t think much about the whispering and thumps she heard from other parts of the house. Once, when the door to her sewing room creaked, she called out, \u201cAngie? What are you doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing Samantha some of the dresses.\u201d Wide-eyed, Angie had appeared in the doorway to the living room. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she\u2019d said absently. Her mind was on more than whether two eight-year-old girls would be careful with the costumes. She was trying to figure out how you called a man you had brutally rejected and said, Gosh, I\u2019ve changed my mind. Ask me again.</p><p>She\u2019d hurt him; Melanie knew she had. What if he\u2019d changed his mind? She\u2019d basically told him that she didn\u2019t love him enough to make any adjustment whatsoever in her life for his sake. Would it be any wonder if she\u2019d killed his love?</p><p>Finally, heart pounding, Melanie picked up the phone and dialed his number. She owed him at least this much. Besides, for her own sake, as well as Angie\u2019s, she had to do something other than wait and hope.</p><p>As the telephone rang, her throat closed with terror. If he\u2019d answered, her voice probably would have failed altogether. As it was, she listened to his voice message, took a deep breath and said, \u201cThis is Melanie. I, um, I\u2019ve been thinking. I did say I would.\u201d She sounded timid, like somebody calling to ask for a loan. \u201cCould we\u2014\u201d her voice squeaked \u201c\u2014well, could we talk again?\u201d</p><p>She dropped the phone back into the cradle as if it were roasting hot and buried her face in her hands. She\u2019d sounded like an idiot! Would he even bother to call her back? She should have gone over there, instead!</p><p>Which would have done no good since he obviously wasn\u2019t home.</p><p>Obviously? Heck, for all she knew, he\u2019d been sitting there listening to her talk to his answering machine.</p><p>Melanie\u2019s hands muffled her whimper.</p><p>The house was awfully silent now. She could hear her own heartbeat. If the phone rang, it would scare her out of her skin. Melanie lifted her head and stared at it.</p><p>Would he call back? Come over? What if he did show up only to say, Sorry, too little, too late?</p><p>She realized five minutes had passed and she was still staring at the phone, as if willing life into it. Do something! she ordered herself.</p><p>Pay bills. That would do to keep her mind occupied, give new direction to her brooding. A cherry secretary desk, inherited from Nana along with the house, stood by the small-paned front windows. In the cubbies, Melanie kept bills, receipts, envelopes and stamps.</p><p>This month\u2019s check statement had arrived and was still unopened. She took out a calculator and soon discovered her checkbook was $2.49 off. In her favor, but she was determined to find the error, anyway. Doggedly she pursued it, but kept finding herself staring at the string of nonsensical numbers on the calculator. Concentrate! she told herself fiercely.</p><p>She almost managed, which might be why it took a moment for the murmur of voices in the hall to register. One of those voices was more of a...rumble. Distinctly masculine. And it said something like, \u201cThanks. Now go upstairs and don\u2019t come down until I call you. Promise?\u201d</p><p>Melanie surfaced; her calculator read $1,973.73. Why, she didn\u2019t know. Her checking account rarely held that much money, and certainly didn\u2019t right now.</p><p>...don\u2019t come down until I call you?</p><p>Trembling, she swung in her chair to face the doorway. Through it strolled a Victorian gentleman in an elegant brocade smoking jacket, cravat and black trousers, with a pipe nonchalantly held between his teeth. A large handsome gentleman with russet hair and gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cKevin?\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>He took the pipe from his mouth and said agreeably, \u201cIndeed, my dear. But not the Kevin you know. This one is a fellow of means dressed to reflect his domestic contentment.\u201d He did a slow turn, as she had when showing students the garments. \u201cHe\u2019s pleased to be home, man of the house.\u201d</p><p>She gaped.</p><p>His expression changed. The pipe clattered to an end table. Voice hoarse, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll let him be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made that jacket.\u201d As if it mattered.</p><p>\u201cJacket?\u201d Kevin looked down at himself and gripped the lapels. \u201cYou mean, this bathrobe thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a smoking jacket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His face held heart-stopping vulnerability when he looked up. \u201cAngie said it\u2019s what a father would wear at home. When he really belonged.\u201d</p><p>She still sat in the straight-backed Queen Anne chair. Her mind didn\u2019t seem to quite grasp the implications. \u201cI just called you,\u201d she said stupidly. \u201cDid you already get my message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Melanie remembered the door to her sewing room opening and closing, the whispers and shuffles. With near outrage, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve been here all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d He shifted uneasily. \u201cFor twenty minutes or half an hour. It took us a while to find the right outfit. Angie wanted me to be a cowboy and lasso you. I had to convince her that wasn\u2019t the right message.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAngie conspired with you?\u201d Of course she had! Wasn\u2019t that what he\u2019d been telling her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cBut I did ask her.\u201d</p><p>Melanie frowned. \u201cShe didn\u2019t call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I called her. Once I realized.\u201d</p> <p>Finally they\u2019d arrived at the heart of the matter. \u201cRealized what?\u201d she almost whispered.</p><p>\u201cThat Elk Springs is home now.\u201d His voice took on a rough urgency. \u201cThat you\u2019re what I\u2019ve been looking for. You and Angie. I don\u2019t want to go back to the Park Service. I\u2019ve been happier here these past months than I\u2019ve been in years. Ever.\u201d He closed the few feet between them and dropped to one knee in front of her, seizing her hands in his. \u201cMelanie, marry me. I won\u2019t uproot you. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled to grasp his. \u201cBut...you can.\u201d</p><p>There was a momentary silence as he studied her in perplexity. \u201cCan what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUproot me.\u201d In a rush she said, \u201cThat\u2019s why I called you. To say that I did think, like I said I would. And I realized that I don\u2019t want to be left behind. If...if you really love me, I\u2019ll go anywhere with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve told me how much you hated moving!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be my first choice,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIt was hard when I was a kid. I\u2019d be dumped into a new school, and when I walked into class the first day, it always felt as if everyone was sneering. I was never wearing the right clothes or...\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. The thing is, I could have been happy with Ryan if he\u2019d been different. If our marriage had been different. Mostly, I was unhappy with him. I was...like a girlfriend, not a wife. I was desperately trying to create a home everywhere we went, and he didn\u2019t want one. The guys were all single.\u201d She concluded simply, \u201cHe wanted to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cHe must have been crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of ways I could continue working,\u201d Melanie continued on a flood of hope. \u201cNo matter where we go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Angie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe makes friends easily.\u201d It was painful to admit the problem had always been hers, never her child\u2019s. \u201cHaving a real father would mean more to her than anything in the world.\u201d</p><p>Kevin squeezed his eyes shut and bowed his head for a moment. Melanie\u2019s heart cramped. Had she said something wrong? Was he having second thoughts now?</p><p>But when he looked up, exultation blazed from his eyes. \u201cYou have no idea what it means to me to have you willing to give up every damned thing you value to come with me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked back tears. \u201cWe can put the house up for sale. Or...or keep it as a rental. Maybe someday...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot someday.\u201d He let go of her hands to frame her face, to brush his thumbs over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to live here, sweetheart. The college has asked me to stay on, to build a new program in park management that will offer a four-year degree. I\u2019ve accepted. I could buy a house of my own, but\u2014\u201d he glanced around \u201c\u2014this one looks appropriate for a college professor. If you don\u2019t mind sharing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing this for me.\u201d That was all she could think. He was offering to give up everything he valued, for her. Hot tears welled in her eyes.</p> <p>His fingertips caught the tears. Voice low and tender, Kevin said, \u201cA selfish part of me wants to say yes. Let you think I\u2019ve made a sacrifice. But the truth is, falling in love with you has made me understand a little sooner what I really want out of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is?\u201d She held her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d His lips were against her cheek now, warm, seeking. \u201cAngie. Friends. Family. Home.\u201d</p><p>Their mouths met for a soft sweet kiss. Melanie\u2019s mind became hazy, but she had enough sanity to argue before it was too late.</p><p>\u201cBut...when you talked about your job and the places you\u2019ve been...\u201d She groped for the right words and found them. \u201cYou had such passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d He stood and pulled her up with him. \u201cBut I was also lonely. I didn\u2019t quit just because I got shot, Melanie. I wasn\u2019t lying when I told you I\u2019d been unhappy before that. My job had changed, I didn\u2019t like the new direction, and... I guess I\u2019d reached an age where I was looking around and noticing that everyone else had something I didn\u2019t. Home and family.\u201d He gave a short laugh.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was Scott\u2019s letters that did it. The guy dove into the family thing from the high platform. He and Meg adopted a little girl, Meg had a teenage boy already, and then Meg got pregnant. Every letter he wrote was so damned happy, I could hardly stand it. Now I know\u2014he had the right idea.\u201d</p><p>Melanie felt as if she were in free fall. No, a parachute had caught her; she was floating now, not tumbling. \u201cDoes that mean, um, that you might like to have other children?\u201d</p><p>A sexy grin blazed on his face. \u201cOh, I\u2019m counting on it, sweetheart.\u201d His hands were wrapped around her waist, his thumbs grazing the underside of her breasts. \u201cUnless you have some objection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Blast it, she was crying again. \u201cNone,\u201d she blubbered.</p><p>He kissed her fiercely. Against her mouth, he said huskily, \u201cI wish we could start right now. But I\u2019m not that sure my orders will be followed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, to stay upstairs?\u201d Through her tears, a giggle rose in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I just heard a bump in the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He swung around and roared, \u201cAngie Parker, you come out this minute!\u201d</p><p>The doorway stayed empty for a moment. Then Angie edged into sight, head bowed, sneaking a peek up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said remorsefully. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wait! But I did make Samantha stay up there.\u201d A tiny smile puckered the dimple in her cheek. \u201cMommy said yes, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d His grin was as wide as a winter quilt. He flung his arm out. \u201cWhaddaya say, kiddo? Group hug?\u201d</p><p>Angie ran to them. Melanie got tears in her eyes as the three of them closed their arms around one another.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Over her daughter\u2019s head, Melanie met Kevin\u2019s gaze. The expression in his eyes was all she\u2019d ever hoped to see. \u201cNot a group hug,\u201d she finished softly. \u201cA family hug.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
