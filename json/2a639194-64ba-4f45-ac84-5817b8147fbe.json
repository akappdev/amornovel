I need to get perspective. It\u2019s not an earthquake or a crazed gunman or a nuclear meltdown, is it? On the scale of disasters, this is not huge. Not huge. One day I expect I\u2019ll look back at this moment and laugh and think, Ha-ha, how silly I was to worry\u2014</p><p>Stop, Poppy. Don\u2019t even try. I\u2019m not laughing\u2014in fact, I feel sick. I\u2019m walking blindly around the hotel ballroom, my heart thudding, looking fruitlessly on the patterned blue carpet, behind gilt chairs, under discarded paper napkins, in places where it couldn\u2019t possibly be.</p><p>I\u2019ve lost it. The only thing in the world I wasn\u2019t supposed to lose. My engagement ring.</p> <p>To say this is a special ring is an understatement. It\u2019s been in Magnus\u2019s family for three generations. It\u2019s this stunning emerald with two diamonds, and Magnus had to get it out of a special bank vault before he proposed. I\u2019ve worn it safely every day for three whole months, religiously putting it on a special china tray at night, feeling for it on my finger every thirty seconds ... and now, the very day his parents are coming back from the States, I\u2019ve lost it. The very same day.</p><p>Professors Antony Tavish and Wanda Brook-Tavish are, at this precise moment, flying back from six months\u2019 sabbatical in Chicago. I can picture them now, eating honey-roasted peanuts and reading academic papers on their his \u2019n\u2019 hers Kindles. I honestly don\u2019t know which of them is more intimidating.</p><p>Him. He\u2019s so sarcastic.</p><p>No, her. With all that frizzy hair and always asking you questions about your views on feminism.</p><p>OK, they\u2019re both bloody scary. And they\u2019re landing in about an hour, and of course they\u2019ll want to see the ring\u2014</p> <p>No. Do not hyperventilate, Poppy. Stay positive. I just need to look at this from a different angle. Like ... what would Poirot do? Poirot wouldn\u2019t flap around in panic. He\u2019d stay calm and use his little gray cells and recall some tiny, vital detail which would be the clue to everything.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes tight. Little gray cells. Come on. Do your best.</p><p>Thing is, I\u2019m not sure Poirot had three glasses of pink champagne and a mojito before he solved the Murder on the Orient Express.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d A gray-haired cleaning lady is trying to get round me with a Hoover, and I gasp in horror. They\u2019re Hoovering the ballroom already? What if they suck it up?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I grab her blue nylon shoulder. \u201cCould you just give me five more minutes to search before you start Hoovering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill looking for your ring?\u201d She shakes her head doubtfully, then brightens. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll find it safe at home. It\u2019s probably been there all the time!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I force myself to nod politely, although I feel like screaming, \u201cI\u2019m not that stupid!\u201d</p><p>I spot another cleaner, on the other side of the ballroom, clearing cupcake crumbs and crumpled paper napkins into a black plastic bin bag. She isn\u2019t concentrating at all. Wasn\u2019t she listening to me?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d My voice shrills out as I sprint across to her. \u201cYou are looking out for my ring, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sign of it so far, love.\u201d The woman sweeps another load of detritus off the table into the bin bag without giving it a second glance.</p><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d I grab for the napkins and pull them out again, feeling each one carefully for a hard lump, not caring that I\u2019m getting buttercream icing all over my hands.</p><p>\u201cDear, I\u2019m trying to clear up.\u201d The cleaner grabs the napkins out of my hands. \u201cLook at the mess you\u2019re making!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I scrabble for the cupcake cases I dropped on the floor. \u201cBut you don\u2019t understand. If I don\u2019t find this ring, I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>I want to grab the bin bag and do a forensics check of the contents with tweezers. I want to put plastic tape round the whole room and declare it a crime scene. It has to be here, it has to be.</p> <p>Unless someone\u2019s still got it. That\u2019s the only other possibility that I\u2019m clinging to. One of my friends is still wearing it and somehow hasn\u2019t noticed. Perhaps it\u2019s slipped into a handbag ... maybe it\u2019s fallen into a pocket ... it\u2019s stuck on the threads of a jumper ... The possibilities in my head are getting more and more far-fetched, but I can\u2019t give up on them.</p><p>\u201cHave you tried the ladies\u2019 room?\u201d The woman tries to get past me.</p><p>Of course I\u2019ve tried the ladies\u2019 room. I checked every single cubicle, on my hands and knees. And then all the basins. Twice. And then I tried to persuade the concierge to close it and have all the sink pipes investigated, but he refused. He said it would be different if I knew it had been lost there for certain, and he was sure the police would agree with him, and could I please step aside from the desk as there were people waiting? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Police. Bah. I thought they\u2019d come roaring round in their squad cars as soon as I called, not just tell me to come down to the police station and file a report. I don\u2019t have time to file a report! I\u2019ve got to find my ring!</p><p>I hurry back to the circular table we were sitting at this afternoon and crawl underneath, patting the carpet yet again. How could I have let this happen? How could I have been so stupid ?</p><p>It was my old school friend Natasha\u2019s idea to get tickets for the Marie Curie Champagne Tea. She couldn\u2019t come to my official hen spa weekend, so this was a kind of substitute. There were eight of us at the table, all merrily swigging champagne and stuffing down cupcakes, and it was right before the raffle started that someone said, \u201cCome on, Poppy, let\u2019s have a go with your ring.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even remember who that was. Annalise, maybe? Annalise was at university with me, and now we work together at First Fit Physio, with Ruby, who was also in our physio course. Ruby was at the tea too, but I\u2019m not sure she tried on the ring. Or did she?</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe how rubbish I am at this. How can I do a Poirot if I can\u2019t even remember the basics? The truth is, everyone seemed to be trying on the ring: Natasha and Clare and Emily (old school friends up from Taunton), Lucinda (my wedding planner, who\u2019s kind of become a friend) and her assistant, Clemency, and Ruby and Annalise (not only college friends and colleagues but my two best friends. They\u2019re going to be my bridesmaids too).</p><p>I\u2019ll admit it: I was basking in all the admiration. I still can\u2019t believe something so grand and beautiful belongs to me. The fact is, I still can\u2019t believe any of it. I\u2019m engaged! Me, Poppy Wyatt. To a tall, handsome university lecturer who\u2019s written a book and even been on the TV. Only six months ago, my love life was a disaster zone. I\u2019d had no significant action for a year and was reluctantly deciding I should give that match.com guy with the bad breath a second chance\u2014and now my wedding\u2019s only ten days away! I wake up every morning and look at Magnus\u2019s smooth, freckled, sleeping back and think, My fianc\u00e9, Dr. Magnus Tavish, Fellow of King\u2019s College London, 1 and feel a tiny tweak of disbelief. And then I swivel round and look at the ring, gleaming expensively on my nightstand, and feel another tweak of disbelief.</p><p>What will Magnus say?</p><p>My stomach clenches and I swallow hard. No. Don\u2019t think about that. Come on, little gray cells. Get with it.</p><p>I remember that Clare wore the ring for a long time. She really didn\u2019t want to take it off. Then Natasha started tugging at it, saying, \u201cMy turn, my turn!\u201d And I remember calling out, \u201cCareful!\u201d</p> <p>I mean, it\u2019s not like I was irresponsible. I was carefully watching the ring as it was passed round the table.</p><p>But then my attention was split, because they started calling out the raffle numbers and the prizes were fantastic. A week in an Italian villa, and a top salon haircut, and a Harvey Nichols voucher ... The ballroom was buzzing, with people pulling out tickets and numbers being called from the platform and women jumping up and shouting, \u201cMe!\u201d</p><p>And this is the moment where I went wrong. This is the gut-churning, if-only instant. If I could go back in time, that\u2019s the moment I would march up to myself and say severely, \u201cPoppy, priorities. \u201d</p><p>But you don\u2019t realize, do you? The moment happens, and you make your crucial mistake, and then it\u2019s gone and the chance to do anything about it is blown away.</p><p>So what happened was, Clare won Wimbledon tickets in the raffle. I love Clare to bits, but she\u2019s always been a tad feeble. She didn\u2019t stand up and yell, \u201cMe! Woohoo!\u201d at top volume, she just raised her hand a few inches. Even those of us at her table didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d won.</p><p>As it dawned on me that Clare was waving a raffle ticket in the air, the presenter on the platform said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll draw again, if there\u2019s no winner ... \u201d</p> <p>\u201cShout!\u201d I poked Clare and waved my own hand wildly. \u201cHere! The winner\u2019s over here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the new number is ... 4403.\u201d</p><p>To my disbelief, some dark-haired girl on the other side of the room started whooping and brandishing a ticket.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t win!\u201d I exclaimed indignantly. \u201c You won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Clare was shrinking back.</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters!\u201d I cried out before I could stop myself, and everyone at the table started laughing.</p><p>\u201cGo, Poppy!\u201d called out Natasha. \u201cGo, White Knightess! Sort it out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Knightie!\u201d</p> <p>This is an old joke. Just because there was this one incident at school, where I started a petition to save the hamsters, everyone began to call me the White Knightess. Or Knightie, for short. My so-called catchphrase is apparently \u201cOf course it matters!\u201d2 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anyway. Suffice it to say that within two minutes I was up on the stage with the dark-haired girl, arguing with the presenter about how my friend\u2019s ticket was more valid than hers.</p><p>I know now that I never should have left the table. I never should have left the ring, even for a second. I can see how stupid that was. But, in my defense, I didn\u2019t know the fire alarm was going to go off, did I?</p><p>It was so surreal. One minute, everyone was sitting down at a jolly champagne tea. The next minute, a siren was blaring through the air and everyone was on their feet, heading for the exits in pandemonium. I could see Annalise, Ruby, and all the others grabbing their bags and making their way to the back. A man in a suit came onto the stage and started ushering me, the dark-haired girl, and the presenter toward a side door and wouldn\u2019t let us go the other way. \u201cYour safety is our priority,\u201d he kept saying.3</p><p>Even then, it\u2019s not as if I was worried. I didn\u2019t think the ring would have gone. I assumed one of my friends had it safe and I\u2019d meet up with everyone outside and get it back.</p> <p>Outside, of course, it was mayhem. As well as our tea, there was some big business conference happening at the hotel, and all the delegates were spilling out of different doors into the road. Hotel staff were trying to make announcements into loudspeakers, and cars were beeping, and it took me ages just to find Natasha and Clare in the m\u00eal\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cHave you got my ring?\u201d I demanded at once, trying not to sound accusatory. \u201cWho\u2019s got it?\u201d</p><p>Both of them looked blank.</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d Natasha shrugged. \u201cDidn\u2019t Annalise have it?\u201d</p><p>So then I plunged into the throng to find Annalise, but she didn\u2019t have it; she thought Clare had it. And Clare thought Clemency had it. And Clemency thought Ruby might have had it, but hadn\u2019t she gone already?</p> <p>The thing about panic is, it creeps up on you. One minute you\u2019re still quite calm, still telling yourself, Don\u2019t be ridiculous. Of course it can\u2019t be lost. The next, the Marie Curie staff are announcing that the event will be curtailed early due to unforeseen circumstances and are handing out goody bags. And all your friends have disappeared to catch the tube. And your finger is still bare. And a voice inside your head is screeching, Oh my God! I knew this would happen! Nobody should ever have entrusted me with an antique ring! Big mistake! Big mistake!</p><p>And that\u2019s how you find yourself under a table an hour later, groping around a grotty hotel carpet, praying desperately for a miracle. (Even though your fianc\u00e9\u2019s father has written a whole bestselling book on how miracles don\u2019t exist and it\u2019s all superstition and even saying \u201cOMG\u201d is the sign of a weak mind.)4</p><p>Suddenly I realize my phone is flashing and grab it with trembling fingers. Three messages have come in, and I scroll through them in hope.</p><p>Found it yet? Annalise xx</p><p>Sorry, babe, haven\u2019t seen it. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t breathe a word to Magnus. N xxx</p><p>Hi Pops! God, how awful, to lose your ring! Actually I thought I saw it ... (incoming text)</p> <p>I stare at my phone, galvanized. Clare thought she saw it? Where?</p><p>I crawl out from under the table and wave my phone around, but the rest of the text resolutely refuses to come through. The signal in here is rubbish. How can this call itself a five-star hotel? I\u2019ll have to go outside.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I approach the gray-haired cleaner, raising my voice above the Hoover\u2019s roar. \u201cI\u2019m popping out to check a text. But if you do find the ring, call me\u2014I\u2019ve given you my mobile number. I\u2019ll just be on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight you are, dear,\u201d says the cleaner patiently.</p><p>I hurry through the lobby, dodging groups of conference delegates, slowing slightly as I pass the concierge\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cAny sign of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing handed in yet, madam.\u201d</p><p>The air outside is balmy, with a hint of summer, even though it\u2019s only mid April. I hope the weather will still be like this in ten days\u2019 time, because my wedding dress is backless and I\u2019m counting on a fine day.</p> <p>There are wide shallow steps in front of the hotel, and I walk up and down them, swishing my phone back and forth, trying to get some signal, with no success. At last I head down onto the actual pavement, waving my phone around more wildly, holding it over my head, then leaning into the quiet Knightsbridge street, my phone in my outstretched fingertips.</p><p>Come on, phone, I mentally cajole it. You can do it. Do it for Poppy. Fetch the message. There must be a signal somewhere ... . You can do it ... .</p><p>\u201cAaaaaaah!\u201d I hear my own yell of shock before I even clock what\u2019s happened. There\u2019s a twisting pain in my shoulder. My fingers feel scratched. A figure on a bike is pedaling swiftly toward the end of the road. I only have time to register an old gray hoodie and skinny black jeans before the bike turns the corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My hand\u2019s empty.

It\u2019s a vital organ.</p><p>\u201cMadam, are you all right?\u201d The doorman is hurrying down the steps. \u201cDid something happen? Did he hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI ...

Have to be so careful in an area like this ... \u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not listening. I\u2019m starting to shake all over. I\u2019ve never felt so bereft and panicky. What do I do without my phone? How do I function? My hand keeps automatically reaching for my phone in its usual place in my pocket. Every instinct in me wants to text someone OMG, I\u2019ve lost my phone! but how can I do that without a bloody phone?</p><p>My phone is my people. It\u2019s my friends. It\u2019s my family. It\u2019s my work. It\u2019s my world. It\u2019s everything. I feel like someone\u2019s wrenched my life support system away from me.</p><p>\u201cShall I call the police, madam?\u201d The doorman is peering at me anxiously.</p> <p>I\u2019m too distracted to reply. I\u2019m consumed with a sudden, even more terrible realization. The ring. I\u2019ve handed out my mobile number to everyone: the cleaners, the ladies\u2019 room attendants, the Marie Curie people, everyone. What if someone finds it? What if someone\u2019s got it and they\u2019re trying to call me right this minute and there\u2019s no answer because hoody guy has already chucked my SIM card into the river?</p><p>Oh God.5 I need to talk to the concierge. I\u2019ll give my home number instead\u2014</p><p>No. Bad idea. If they leave a message, Magnus might hear it.6</p><p>OK, so ... so ... I\u2019ll give my work number. Yes.</p><p>Except no one will be at the physio clinic this evening. I can\u2019t go and sit there for hours, just in case.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel seriously freaked out now. Everything\u2019s unraveling.</p> <p>To make matters even worse, as I run back in to the lobby, the concierge is busy. His desk is surrounded by a large group of conference delegates talking about restaurant reservations. I try to catch his eye, hoping he\u2019ll beckon me forward as a priority, but he studiously ignores me, and I feel a twinge of hurt. I know I\u201cve taken up quite a lot of his time this afternoon\u2014but doesn\u2019t he realize what a hideous crisis I\u2019m in?</p><p>\u201cMadam.\u201d The doorman has followed me into the lobby, his brow creased with concern. \u201cCan we get you something for the shock? Arnold!\u201d He briskly calls over a waiter. \u201cA brandy for the lady, please, on the house. And if you\u2019ll talk to our concierge, he\u2019ll help you with the police. Would you like to sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d A thought suddenly occurs to me. \u201cMaybe I should phone my own number! Call the mugger! I could ask him to come back, offer him a reward ... What do you think? Could I borrow your phone?\u201d</p><p>The doorman almost recoils as I thrust out a hand.</p><p>\u201cMadam, I think that would be a very foolhardy action,\u201d he says severely. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure the police will agree you should do no such thing. I think you must be in shock. Kindly have a seat and try to relax.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Maybe he\u2019s right. I\u2019m not wild about setting up some assignation with a criminal in a hoody. But I can\u2019t sit down and relax; I\u2019m far too hyper. To calm my nerves, I start walking round and round the same path, my heels clicking on the marble floor. Past the massive potted ficus tree ... past the table with newspapers ... past a big shiny litter bin ... back to the ficus. It\u2019s a comforting little circuit, and I can keep my eyes fixed on the concierge the whole time, waiting for him to be free.</p><p>The lobby is still bustling with business types. Through the glass doors I can see the doorman back on the steps, busy hailing taxis and pocketing tips. A squat Japanese man in a blue suit is standing near me with some European-looking businessmen, exclaiming in what sounds like loud, furious Japanese and gesticulating at everybody with the conference pass strung round his neck on a red cord. He\u2019s so short and the other men look so nervous, I almost want to smile.</p><p>The brandy arrives on a salver and I pause briefly to drain it in one, then keep walking in the same repetitive route.</p> <p>Potted ficus ... newspaper table ... litter bin ... potted ficus ... newspaper table ... litter bin ...</p><p>Now that I\u2019ve calmed down a bit, I\u2019m starting to churn with murderous thoughts. Does that hoody guy realize he\u2019s wrecked my life? Does he realize how crucial a phone is? It\u2019s the worst thing you can steal from a person. The worst. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it wasn\u2019t even that great a phone.

A mobile phone.</p><p>1 His specialism is Cultural Symbolism. I speed-read his book, The Philosophy of Symbolism, after our second date and then tried to pretend I\u2019d read it ages ago, coincidentally, for pleasure. (Which, to be fair, he didn\u2019t believe for a minute.) Anyway, the point is, I read it. And what impressed me most was: There were so many footnotes. I\u2019ve totally got into them. Aren\u2019t they handy? You just bung them in whenever you want and instantly look clever.</p><p>Magnus says footnotes are for things which aren\u2019t your main concern but nevertheless hold some interest for you. So. This is my footnote about footnotes.</p><p>2 Which, actually, I never say. Just like Humphrey Bogart never said, \u201cPlay it again, Sam.\u201d It\u2019s an urban myth.</p><p>3 Of course, the hotel wasn\u2019t on fire. The system had short-circuited. I found that out afterward, not that it was any consolation.</p><p>4 Did Poirot ever say \u201coh my God\u201d? I bet he did. Or \u201c sacrebleu! \u201d which comes to the same thing. And does this not disprove Antony\u2019s theory, since Poirot\u2019s gray cells are clearly stronger than anyone else\u2019s? I might point this out to Antony one day. When I\u2019m feeling brave. (Which, if I\u2019ve lost the ring, will be never, obviously.)</p> <p>5 Weak mind.</p><p>6 I\u2019m allowed to give myself at least a chance of getting it back safely and him never having to know, aren\u2019t I?</p><p>2</p><p>I blink a few times and look again\u2014but it\u2019s still there, half hidden amid a couple of discarded conference programs and a Starbucks cup. What\u2019s a phone doing in a bin ?</p><p>I look around to see if anyone\u2019s watching me\u2014then reach in gingerly and pull it out. It has a couple of drops of coffee on it, but otherwise it seems perfect. It\u2019s a good one too. A Nokia. New.</p><p>Cautiously, I turn and survey the thronging lobby. Nobody\u2019s paying me the slightest bit of attention. No one\u2019s rushing up and exclaiming \u201c There\u2019s my phone!\u201d And I\u2019ve been walking around this area for the last ten minutes. Whoever threw this phone in here did it a while ago.</p><p>There\u2019s a sticker on the back of the phone, with White Globe Consulting Group printed in tiny letters and a number. Did someone just chuck it away? Is it bust? I press the on switch and the screen glows. It seems in perfect working order to me.</p><p>A tiny voice in my head is telling me that I should hand it in. Take it up to the front desk and say, \u201cExcuse me, I think someone\u2019s lost this phone.\u201d That\u2019s what I should do. March up to the desk right now, like any responsible, civic member of society... .</p> <p>My feet don\u2019t move an inch. My hand tightens protectively round the phone. Thing is, I need a phone. I bet White Globe Consulting Group, whoever that is, has millions of phones. And it\u2019s not like I found it on the floor or in the ladies\u2019 room, is it? It was in a bin. Things in bins are rubbish. They\u2019re fair game. They\u2019ve been relinquished to the world. That\u2019s the rule.</p><p>I peer into the bin again and glimpse a red cord, just like the ones round all the delegates\u2019 necks. I check the concierge to make sure he\u2019s not watching, then plunge my hand in again and pull out a conference pass. A mug shot of a stunningly pretty girl stares back at me, under which is printed: Violet Russell, White Globe Consulting Group.</p><p>I\u2019m building up a pretty good theory now. I could be Poirot. This is Violet Russell\u2019s phone and she threw it away. For ... some reason or other.</p><p>Well, that\u2019s her fault. Not mine.</p><p>The phone buzzes and I start. Shit! It\u2019s alive. The ring tone begins at top volume\u2014and it\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d I quickly press ignore, but a moment later it starts up again, loud and unmistakable.</p><p>Isn\u2019t there a bloody volume control on this thing? A couple of nearby businesswomen have turned to stare, and I\u2019m so flustered that I jab at talk instead of ignore. The businesswomen are still watching me, so I press the phone to my ear and turn away.</p><p>\u201cThe person you have called is not available,\u201d I say, trying to sound robotic. \u201cPlease leave a message.\u201d That\u2019ll get rid of whoever it is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere the fuck are you?\u201d A smooth, well-educated male voice starts speaking and I nearly squeak with astonishment. It worked! He thinks I\u2019m a machine! \u201cI\u2019ve just been talking to Scottie. He has a contact who reckons he can do it. It\u2019ll be like keyhole surgery. He\u2019s good. There won\u2019t be any trace.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t dare breathe. Or scratch my nose, which is suddenly incredibly itchy.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d the man is saying. \u201cSo, whatever else you do, be fucking careful.\u201d</p><p>He rings off and I stare at the phone in astonishment. I never thought anyone would actually leave a message.</p> <p>Now I feel a bit guilty. This is a genuine voice mail, and Violet\u2019s missed it. I mean, it\u2019s not my fault she threw her phone away, but even so ... On impulse I scrabble in my bag for a pen and the only thing I\u2019ve got to write on, which is an old theater program.7 I scribble down: Scottie has a contact, keyhole surgery, no trace, be fucking careful.</p><p>God alone knows what that\u2019s all about. Liposuction, maybe? Anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. The point is, if I ever do meet this Violet girl, I\u2019ll be able to pass it on.</p><p>Before the phone can ring again, I hurry to the concierge\u2019s desk, which has miraculously cleared.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cMe again. Has anyone found my ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I please assure you, madam,\u201d he says with a frosty smile, \u201cthat we would have let you know if we had found it. We do have your phone number\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t!\u201d I cut him off, almost triumphantly. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing! The number I gave you is now ... er ... defunct. Out of use. Very much so.\u201d The last thing I want is him calling hoody guy and mentioning a priceless emerald ring. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call it. Can you use this number instead?\u201d I carefully copy the phone number from the back of the White Globe Consulting phone. \u201cIn fact, just to be sure ... can I test it?\u201d I reach for the hotel landline phone and dial the printed number. A moment later Beyonc\u00e9 starts blasting out of the mobile phone. OK. At last I can relax a little. I\u2019ve got a number.</p><p>\u201cMadam, was there anything else?\u201d</p><p>The concierge is starting to look quite pissed off, and there\u2019s a queue of people building behind me. So I thank him again and head to a nearby sofa, full of adrenaline. I have a phone and I have a plan.</p><p>It only takes me five minutes to write out my new mobile number on twenty separate pieces of hotel writing paper, with POPPY WYATT\u2014EMERALD RING, PLEASE CALL!!!! in big capitals. To my annoyance, the doors to the ballroom are now locked (although I\u2019m sure I can hear the cleaners inside), so I\u2019m forced to roam around the hotel corridors, the tea room, the ladies\u2019 rooms, and even the spa, handing my number out to every hotel worker I come across and explaining the story.</p><p>I call the police and dictate my new number to them. I text Ruby\u2014whose mobile number I know by heart\u2014saying:</p><p>Hi! Phone stolen. This is my new mobile number. Cn u pass to everyone? Any sign of ring???</p> <p>Then I flop onto the sofa in exhaustion. I feel like I\u2019ve been living in this bloody hotel all day. I should phone Magnus too and give him this number\u2014but I can\u2019t face it yet. I have this irrational conviction that he\u2019ll be able to tell from my tone of voice that my ring is missing. He\u2019ll sense my bare finger the minute I say, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Please come back, ring. Please, PLEASE come back ... .</p><p>I\u2019ve leaned back, closed my eyes, and am trying to send a telepathic message through the ether. So when Beyonc\u00e9 starts up again, I give a startled jump. Maybe this is it! My ring! Someone found it! I don\u2019t even check the screen before pressing talk and answering excitedly, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet?\u201d A man\u2019s voice hits my ear. It\u2019s not the man who called before; it\u2019s a guy with a deeper voice. He sounds a bit bad-tempered, if you can tell that just from three syllables.8 He\u2019s also breathing quite heavily, which means he\u2019s either a pervert or doing some exercise. \u201cAre you in the lobby? Is the Japanese contingent still there?\u201d</p><p>In reflex, I look around. There are a whole bunch of Japanese people by the doors.</p><p>\u201cYes, they are,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I\u2019m not Violet. This isn\u2019t Violet\u2019s phone anymore. Sorry. Maybe you could spread the word that her number\u2019s changed?\u201d</p><p>I need to get Violet\u2019s mates off my case. I can\u2019t have them ringing me every five seconds.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, who is this?\u201d the man demands. \u201cWhy are you answering this number? Where\u2019s Violet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI possess this phone,\u201d I say, more confidently than I feel. Which is true. Possession is nine-tenths of the law.9 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou possess it?

Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop him. Go up to him and stop him leaving the hotel. Go up to him now.

Are you a friend of Violet? Can you tell me exactly why she decided to quit her job halfway through the biggest conference of the year? Does she think I suddenly don\u2019t need a PA anymore?\u201d</p><p>Aha. So Violet\u2019s his personal assistant. This makes sense. And she walked out on him! Well, I\u2019m not surprised, he\u2019s so bossy.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he interrupts himself. \u201cPoint is, I\u2019m on the stairs, floor nine, the lift jammed, I\u2019ll be downstairs in less than three minutes, and you have to keep Yuichi Yamasaki there till I arrive. Whoever the hell you are.\u201d</p><p>What a nerve.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d I retort.</p> <p>\u201cOr else a year of careful negotiation goes down the tubes because of one ridiculous misunderstanding. The biggest deal of the year falls apart. A team of twenty people lose their jobs.\u201d His voice is relentless. \u201cSenior managers, secretaries, the whole gang. Just because I can\u2019t get down there fast enough and the one person who could help won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Oh, bloody hell.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d I say furiously. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best. What\u2019s his name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYamasaki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I raise my voice, running forward across the lobby. \u201cPlease! Mr. Yamasaki? Could you wait a minute?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Yamasaki turns questioningly, and a couple of flunkies move forward, flanking him protectively. He has a broad face, still creased in anger, and a wide, bullish neck, around which he\u2019s draping a silk scarf. I get the sense he\u2019s not into idle chitchat.</p><p>I have no idea what to say next. I don\u2019t speak Japanese, I don\u2019t know anything about Japanese business or Japanese culture. Apart from sushi. But I can\u2019t exactly go up to him and say \u201cSushi!\u201d out of the blue. It would be like going up to a top American businessman and saying \u201cT-bone steak!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... a huge fan,\u201d I improvise. \u201cOf your work. Could I have your autograph?\u201d</p> <p>He looks puzzled, and one of his colleagues whispers a translation into his ear. Immediately, his brow clears and he bows to me.</p><p>Cautiously, I bow back, and he snaps his fingers, barking an instruction. A moment later, a beautiful leather folder has been opened in front of him, and he\u2019s writing something elaborate in Japanese.</p><p>\u201cIs he still there?\u201d The stranger\u2019s voice suddenly emanates from the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I mutter into it. \u201cJust about. Where are you?\u201d I shoot a bright smile at Mr. Yamasaki.</p><p>\u201cFifth floor. Keep him there. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Yamasaki hands me his piece of paper, caps his pen, bows again, and makes to walk off.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I cry desperately. \u201cCould I ... show you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Yamasaki is very busy.\u201d One of his colleagues, wearing steel glasses and the whitest shirt I\u2019ve ever seen, turns back. \u201cKindly contact our office.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re heading away again. What do I do now? I can\u2019t ask for another autograph. I can\u2019t rugby-tackle him. I need to attract his attention somehow.</p><p>\u201cI have a special announcement to make!\u201d I exclaim, hurrying after them. \u201cI am a singing telegram! I bear a message from all Mr. Yamasaki\u2019s many fans. It would be a great discourtesy to them if you were to refuse me.\u201d</p><p>The word discourtesy seems to have stopped them in their tracks. They\u2019re frowning and exchanging confused glances.</p><p>\u201cA singing telegram?\u201d says the man in steel glasses suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cLike a Gorilla Gram?\u201d I offer. \u201cOnly singing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s made things any clearer.</p><p>The interpreter murmurs furiously in Mr. Yamasaki\u2019s ear and after a moment looks at me.</p><p>\u201cYou may present.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Yamasaki turns and all his colleagues follow suit, folding their arms expectantly and lining up in a row.

Number three, why did I say singing telegram?</p><p>But if I don\u2019t do something soon, twenty people might lose their jobs.</p> <p>I make a deep bow, to spin out some more time, and all the Japanese bow back.</p><p>\u201cBegin,\u201d repeats the man in steel spectacles, his eyes glinting ominously.</p><p>I take a deep breath. Come on. It doesn\u2019t matter what I do. I only have to last half a minute. Then I can run away and they\u2019ll never see me again.</p><p>\u201cMr. Yamasaki ... \u201d I begin cautiously, to the tune of \u201cSingle Ladies.\u201d \u201cMr. Yamasaki. Mr. Yamasaki, Mr. Yamasaki.\u201d I shimmy my hips and shoulders at him, just like Beyonc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cMr. Yamasaki, Mr. Yamasaki.\u201d</p><p>Actually, this is quite easy. I don\u2019t need any lyrics\u2014I can keep singing \u201cMr. Yamasaki\u201d over and over. After a few moments, some of the Japanese even start singing along and clapping Mr. Yamasaki on the back.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Yamasaki, Mr. Yamasaki. Mr. Yamasaki, Mr. Yamasaki.\u201d I lift my finger and waggle it at him with a wink. \u201cOoh-ooh-ooh ... ooh-ooh-ooh ... \u201d</p><p>This song is ridiculously catchy. All the Japanese are singing now, apart from Mr. Yamasaki, who\u2019s standing there, looking delighted. Some nearby delegates have joined in with the singing, and I can hear one of them saying, \u201cIs this a flash mob thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Yamasaki, Mr. Yamasaki, Mr. Yamasaki ... Where are you?\u201d I mutter into the phone, still beaming brightly.</p><p>\u201cWatching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My head jerks up and I sweep the lobby.</p><p>Suddenly my gaze fixes on a man standing alone, about thirty yards away. He\u2019s wearing a dark suit and has thick black rumpled hair and is holding a phone to his ear. Even from this distance I can see that he\u2019s laughing.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been there?\u201d I demand furiously.</p><p>\u201cJust arrived. Didn\u2019t want to interrupt. Great job, by the way,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think you won Yamasaki round to the cause, right there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cGlad I could help. He\u2019s all yours.\u201d I bow to Mr. Yamasaki with a flourish, then turn on my heel and head swiftly toward the exit, ignoring the disappointed cries of the Japanese. I\u2019ve got more important stuff to worry about than arrogant strangers and their stupid business deals.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d The man\u2019s voice follows me through the receiver. \u201cThat phone. It\u2019s my PA\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she shouldn\u2019t have thrown it away, then,\u201d I retort, pushing the glass doors open. \u201cFinders keepers.\u201d</p><p>There are twelve tube stops from Knightsbridge to Magnus\u2019s parents\u2019 house in North London, and as soon as I resurface from the underground I check the phone. It\u2019s flashing with new messages\u2014about ten texts and twenty emails\u2014but there are only five texts for me and none with news about the ring. One\u2019s from the police, and my heart leaps with hope\u2014but it\u2019s only to confirm that I\u2019ve filed a report and asking if I want a visit from a victim support officer.</p><p>The rest are all text messages and emails for Violet. As I scroll down them, I notice that Sam features in the subject heading of quite a few of the emails. Feeling like Poirot again, I check back on the numbers called function and, sure enough, the last number that called this phone was Sam Mobile. So that\u2019s him. Violet\u2019s boss. Dark-rumpled-hair guy. And to prove it, her email address is</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>Just out of the mildest curiosity, I click on one of the emails. It\u2019s from</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>, and the subject is Re: Dinner?</p><p>Thanks, Violet. I\u2019d appreciate you not mentioning any of this to Sam. I feel a little embarrassed now!</p><p>Ooh. What\u2019s she embarrassed about? Before I can stop myself, I\u2019ve scrolled down to read the previous email, which was sent yesterday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Actually, Jenna, you should know something: Sam\u2019s engaged.</p><p>Best, Violet</p><p>He\u2019s engaged.

I don\u2019t even know the guy.</p> <p>OK, now I have to know the whole story. Why is Jenna embarrassed? What happened? I scroll down still farther past a couple more exchanges, and at last find a long introductory email from Jenna, who clearly met this Sam Roxton at a business function, got the hots for him, and invited him to dinner two weeks ago, but he hasn\u2019t returned her calls.</p><p> ... tried again yesterday ... maybe using the wrong number ... someone told me he is notorious and that his PA is always the best route to contact him ... very sorry to bother you ... possibly just let me know either way ...</p><p>Poor woman.

Whatever. I suddenly realize I\u2019m snooping in someone else\u2019s in-box when I have a lot of other, more important things to be thinking about. Priorities, Poppy. I need to buy some wine for Magnus\u2019s parents. And a welcome-home card\u2014And, if I don\u2019t track down the ring in the next twenty minutes\u2014some gloves.</p><p>Disaster. Disaster. It turns out they don\u2019t sell gloves in April. The only ones I could find were from the back room in Accessorize. Old Christmas stock, available only in a small.</p> <p>I cannot believe I\u2019m seriously planning to greet my prospective in-laws in too-tight red woolly reindeer gloves. With tassels.</p><p>But I have no choice. It\u2019s that or walk in bare-handed.</p><p>As I start the long climb up the hill to Magnus\u2019s parents\u2019 house, I\u2019m starting to feel really sick. It\u2019s not just the ring. It\u2019s the whole scary prospective in-laws thing. I turn the corner\u2014and all the windows of the house are alight. They\u2019re home.</p><p>I\u2019ve never known a house which suits a family as much as the Tavishes\u2019 does. It\u2019s older and grander than any of the others in the street and looks down on them from its superior position. There are yew trees and a monkey puzzle in the garden. The bricks are covered in ivy, and the windows still have their original 1835 wooden frames. Inside, there\u2019s William Morris wallpaper dating from the 1960s, and the floorboards are covered with Turkish carpets.</p><p>Except you can\u2019t actually see the carpets, because they\u2019re mostly covered in old documents and manuscripts which no one ever bothers to clear up. No one\u2019s big on tidying in the Tavish family. I once found a fossilized boiled egg in a spare-room bed, still in its egg cup, with a desiccated toast soldier. It must have been about a year old.</p><p>And everywhere, all over the house, are books. Stacked up three deep on shelves, piled on the floor, and on the side of every lime-stained bath. Antony writes books, Wanda writes books, Magnus writes books, and his elder brother, Conrad, writes books. Even Conrad\u2019s wife, Margot, writes books.12</p> <p>Which is great. I mean, it\u2019s a wonderful thing, all these genius intellectuals in one family. But it does make you feel just the teensiest, weensiest bit inadequate.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think I\u2019m pretty intelligent. You know, for a normal person who went to school and college and got a job and everything. But these aren\u2019t normal people; they\u2019re in a different league. They have superbrains. They\u2019re the academic version of The Incredibles. 13 I\u2019ve met his parents only a few times, when they flew back to London for a week for Antony to give some big important lecture, but it was enough to show me. While Antony was lecturing about political theory, Wanda was presenting a paper on feminist Judaism to a think tank, and then they both appeared on The Culture Show, taking opposing views on a documentary about the influence of the Renaissance.14 So that was the backdrop to our meeting. No pressure or anything.</p><p>I\u2019ve been introduced to quite a few different boyfriends\u2019 parents over the years, but hands down this was the worst experience, ever. We\u2019d just shaken hands and made a bit of small talk and I was telling Wanda quite proudly where I\u2019d been to college, when Antony looked up over his half-moon glasses, with those bright, cold eyes of his, and said, \u201cA degree in physiotherapy. How amusing.\u201d I felt instantly crushed. I didn\u2019t know what to say. In fact, I was so flustered I left the room to go to the loo.15</p><p>After that, of course, I froze. Those three days were sheer misery. The more intellectual the conversation became, the more tongue-tied and awkward I was. My second-worst moment: pronouncing Proust wrong and everyone exchanging looks.16 My very worst moment: watching University Challenge all together in the drawing room, when a section on bones came on. My subject! I studied this! I know all the Latin names and everything! But as I was drawing breath to answer the first question, Antony had already given the correct answer. I was quicker next time\u2014but he still beat me. The whole thing was like a race, and he won. Then, at the end, he looked over at me and inquired, \u201cDo they not teach anatomy at physiotherapy school, Poppy?\u201d and I was mortified. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Magnus says he loves me, not my brain, and that I\u2019ve got to ignore his parents. And Natasha said, think of the rock and the Hampstead house and the villa in Tuscany. Which is Natasha for you. Whereas my own approach has been as follows: Just don\u2019t think about them. It\u2019s been fine. They\u2019ve been safely in Chicago, thousands of miles away.</p><p>But now they\u2019re back.</p><p>Oh God. And I\u2019m still a bit shaky on Proust. (Proost? Prost?) And I didn\u2019t revise the Latin names for bones. And I\u2019m wearing red woolly reindeer gloves in April. With tassels.</p><p>My legs are shaking as I ring the bell. Actually shaking. I feel like the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Any minute I\u2019ll collapse on the path and Wanda will torch me for losing the ring.</p> <p>Stop, Poppy. It\u2019s fine. No one will suspect anything, My story is, I burned my hand. That\u2019s my story.</p><p>\u201cHi, Poppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelix! Hi!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m so relieved it\u2019s Felix at the door, my greeting comes out in a shaky gasp.</p><p>Felix is the baby of the family\u2014only seventeen and still at school. In fact, Magnus has been living in the house with him while his parents have been away, as kind of babysitter, and I moved in after we got engaged. Not that Felix needs a babysitter. He\u2019s completely self-contained, reads all the time, and you never even know he\u2019s in the house. I once tried to give him a friendly little \u201cdrugs chat.\u201d He politely corrected me on every single fact, then said he\u2019d noticed I drank above the recommended guidelines of Red Bull and did I think I might have an addiction? That was the last time I tried to act the older sister.</p> <p>Anyway. That\u2019s all come to an end, now that Antony and Wanda are returning from the States. I\u2019ve moved back to my flat and we\u2019ve started looking for places to rent. Magnus was all for staying here. He thought we could continue using the spare bedroom and bathroom on the top floor, and wouldn\u2019t it be convenient, as he could carry on using his father\u2019s library?</p><p>Is he nuts? There is no way I am living under the same roof as the Tavishes.</p><p>I follow Felix into the kitchen, where Magnus is lounging on a kitchen chair, gesturing at a page of typescript, and saying, \u201cI think your argument goes wrong here. Second paragraph.\u201d</p><p>However Magnus sits, whatever he does, he somehow manages to looks elegant. His suede-brogued feet are up on a chair, he\u2019s halfway through a cigarette,17 and his tawny hair is thrown back off his brow like a waterfall.</p><p>The Tavishes all have the same coloring, like a family of foxes. Even Wanda hennas her hair. But Magnus is the best-looking of all, and I\u2019m not just saying that because I\u2019m marrying him. His skin is freckled but tans easily too, and his red-brown hair is like something out of a hair ad. That\u2019s why he keeps it long.18 He\u2019s actually quite vain about it.</p><p>Plus, although he\u2019s an academic, he\u2019s not some fusty guy who sits inside reading books all day. He skis really well, and he\u2019s going to teach me too. That\u2019s how we met, in fact. He\u2019d sprained his wrist skiing and he came in for physio after his doctor recommended us. He was supposed to be seeing Annalise, but she switched him for one of her regulars and he ended up coming to me instead. The next week he asked me out on a date, and after a month he proposed. A month!19</p> <p>Now Magnus looks up and his face brightens. \u201cSweetheart! How\u2019s my beautiful girl? Come here.\u201d He beckons me over for a kiss, then frames my face in his hands, like he always does.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I force a smile. \u201cSo, are your parents here? How was their flight? I can\u2019t wait to see them.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to sound as keen as I can, even though my legs are wanting to run away, out the door and down the hill.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you get my text?\u201d Magnus seems puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat text? Oh. \u201d I suddenly realize. \u201cOf course. I lost my phone. I\u2019ve got a new number. I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost your phone?\u201d Magnus stares at me. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cJust ... lost it and had to get a new one. No biggie. No drama.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve decided on a general policy that the less I say to Magnus right now, the better. I don\u2019t want to get into any discussions as to why I might be clinging desperately to some random phone I found in a bin.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what did your text say?\u201d I quickly add, trying to move the conversation on.</p><p>\u201cMy parents\u2019 plane was diverted. They had to go to Manchester. Won\u2019t be back till tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Diverted?</p><p>Manchester?</p><p>Oh my God. I\u2019m safe! I\u2019m reprieved! My legs can stop wobbling! I want to sing the \u201cHallelujah\u201d chorus. Ma-an-chester! Ma-an-chester! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod, how awful. \u201d I\u2019m trying hard to twist my face into a disappointed expression. \u201cPoor them. Manchester. That\u2019s miles away! I was really looking forward to seeing them too. What a pain.\u201d</p><p>I think I sound pretty convincing. Felix shoots me an odd look, but Magnus has already picked up the typescript again. He hasn\u2019t commented on my gloves. Nor has Felix.</p><p>Maybe I can relax a notch.</p><p>\u201cSo ... er ... guys.\u201d I survey the room. \u201cWhat about the kitchen?\u201d</p> <p>Magnus and Felix said they were going to clear up this afternoon, but the place is a bomb site. There are takeaway boxes on the kitchen table and a stack of books on top of the hob and even one in a saucepan. \u201cYour parents will be back tomorrow. Shouldn\u2019t we do something?\u201d</p><p>Magnus looks unmoved. \u201cThey won\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all very well for him to say that. But I\u2019m the daughter-in-law (nearly) who\u2019s been living here and will get the blame.</p><p>Magnus and Felix have begun talking about some footnote,20 so I head over to the hob and start a quick tidy-up. I don\u2019t dare remove my gloves, but the guys aren\u2019t giving me the slightest glance, thankfully. At least I know the rest of the house is OK. I went over the whole place yesterday, replaced all the old manky bottles of bubble bath and got a new blind for the bathroom. Best of all, I tracked down some anemones for Wanda\u2019s study. Everyone knows she loves anemones. She\u2019s even written an article about \u201canemones in literature\u201d. (Which is typical of this family\u2014you can\u2019t just enjoy something, you have to become a top academic expert on it.)</p><p>Magnus and Felix are still engrossed as I finish. The house is tidy. No one\u2019s asked me about the ring. I\u2019ll quit while I\u2019m ahead.</p> <p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll head home,\u201d I say casually, and drop a kiss on Magnus\u2019s head. \u201cYou stay here, keep Felix company. Say welcome home to your parents from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay the night!\u201d Magnus sweeps an arm round my waist and pulls me back. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to see you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you welcome them. I\u2019ll catch up tomorrow.\u201d I smile brightly, to distract attention from the fact that I\u2019m edging toward the door, my hands behind my back. \u201cPlenty of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you,\u201d says Felix, looking up for the first time since I\u2019ve arrived at the house.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I say, a bit puzzled. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sticking around.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI think you\u2019re being remarkably sanguine, given their reaction. I\u2019ve been meaning to say so for weeks. You must be a very good person, Poppy.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s he talking about?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014what do you mean?\u201d I turn to Magnus for help.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he says, too quickly. But Felix is staring at his older brother, a light dawning in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Didn\u2019t you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelix, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t, did you? That\u2019s not exactly fair, is it, Mag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d I\u2019m turning from face to face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Magnus sounds rattled. \u201cJust ... \u201d He finally meets my eyes. \u201cOK. My parents weren\u2019t exactly wild to hear we\u2019re engaged. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment I don\u2019t know how to react. I stare at him dumbly, trying to process what I heard.</p><p>\u201cBut you said ... \u201d I don\u2019t quite trust my voice. \u201cYou said they were thrilled. You said they were excited!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will be thrilled,\u201d he says crossly. \u201cWhen they see sense.\u201d</p><p>They will be?</p><p>My whole world is wobbling. It was bad enough when I thought Magnus\u2019s parents were intimidating geniuses. But all this time they\u2019ve been against us getting married ?</p><p>\u201cYou told me they said they couldn\u2019t imagine a sweeter, more charming daughter-in-law.\u201d I\u2019m trembling all over by now. \u201cYou said they sent me special love from Chicago! Was all that lies ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to upset you!\u201d Magnus glares at Felix. \u201cLook, it\u2019s no big deal. They\u2019ll come round. They simply think it\u2019s all a bit fast... . They don\u2019t know you properly... . They\u2019re idiots,\u201d he ends with a scowl. \u201cI told them so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a row with your parents?\u201d I stare at him, dismayed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a row,\u201d he says defensively. \u201cIt was more ... a falling-out.\u201d</p><p>A falling-out?

He gets to his feet and takes me firmly by the shoulders. \u201cThis is exactly why I didn\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s family nonsense and it\u2019s got nothing to do with us. I love you. We\u2019re getting married. I\u2019m going to do this and I\u2019m going to see it through whatever anyone else says, whether it\u2019s my parents or my friends or anyone else. This is about us. \u201d His voice is so firm, I start to relax. \u201cAnd, anyway, as soon as my parents spend some time with you, they\u2019ll come round.

I really am.</p><p>The whole ring debacle nearly came out. It would have, if it weren\u2019t for Felix. I was halfway through my ludicrous, stumbling hand-burning excuse, expecting Magnus to become suspicious at any moment, when Felix yawned and said, \u201cShall we go to the pub?\u201d and Magnus suddenly remembered an email he had to send first and everyone forgot about my gloves.</p><p>And I chose that opportunity to leave. Very quickly.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m sitting on the bus, staring out into the dark night, feeling cold inside. I\u2019ve lost the ring. The Tavishes don\u2019t want me to marry Magnus.

It\u2019s him. Sam Roxton.</p><p>\u201cYou ran off,\u201d he says with no preamble. \u201cI need that phone back. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>Charming. Not \u201cThank you so much for helping me with my Japanese business deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I say. \u201cAnytime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d He sounds momentarily discomfited. \u201cRight. Thanks. I owe you one. Now, how are you going to get that phone back to me? You could drop it round at the office or I could send a bike. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent. I\u2019m not going to get it back to him. I need this number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I clutch the phone more tightly and swallow hard. \u201cThe thing is, I need to borrow this phone.

Not that it\u2019s very interesting.</p><p>Violet, please ask Sam to call me. His phone is switched off. Best, Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cShit. Shit. \u201d Sam\u2019s silent for a moment. \u201cOK, if he texts again, you let me know straightaway, OK? Ring me.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth automatically to say, \u201cWhat about your dad? Why don\u2019t you ever ring him ?\u201d Then I close it again. No, Poppy. Bad idea.</p><p>\u201cOoh, there was a phone message earlier,\u201d I say, suddenly remembering. \u201cAbout liposuction or something, I think. That wasn\u2019t for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiposuction?\u201d he echoes incredulously. \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to sound so scoffing. I was only asking. It must have been for Violet. Not that she\u2019s likely to need liposuction, if she\u2019s off modeling.</p><p>\u201cSo ... we\u2019re on? We have a deal?\u201d</p><p>For a while he doesn\u2019t reply, and I have an image of him glowering at his cell phone. I don\u2019t exactly get the feeling he\u2019s relishing this arrangement. But then, what choice does he have?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the PA email address transferred back to my inbox,\u201d he says grouchily, almost to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the tech guys tomorrow. But the texts will keep coming to you.

They\u2019ve found it! They\u2019ve found it!</p><p>My fingers are fumbling as I unlock the phone, my mind galloping ahead. An early-morning cleaner found the ring clogging up a Hoover ... discovered it in the ladies\u2019 room ... saw a glint on the carpet ... now securely locked in the hotel safe ...</p><p>Dear Guest,</p><p>Summer breaks, half price.</p><p>Please visit</p><p>www.berrowhotellondon.co.uk</p><p>. for details.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>The Berrow Team</p><p>I sag back on the bed, leaden with disappointment. Not to mention anger at whoever put me on the mailing list. How could they do that? Are they trying to play with my neuroses?</p><p>At the same time, a nasty realization is turning around and around in my stomach. Another eight hours have passed since I lost the ring. The longer it\u2019s not found\u2014</p><p>What if\u2014</p><p>I can\u2019t even finish my thoughts. Abruptly, I get out of bed and pad through to the kitchen. I\u2019ll make a cup of tea and send on some more messages to Sam Roxton. That\u2019ll take my mind off things.</p><p>The phone has started buzzing again with texts and emails, so I turn on the kettle, perch on the window seat, and start scrolling through, trying desperately not to hope. Sure enough, every message is just some friend asking if I\u2019ve found the ring yet and making suggestions like have you checked your handbag pockets?</p><p>There\u2019s nothing from Magnus, even though I sent him a couple of texts last night, asking what else his parents had said about me and when was he planning to tell me, and how was I going to face them now, and was he ignoring me on purpose?22</p><p>At last I turn to Sam\u2019s messages. He clearly hasn\u2019t had the email function transferred yet, because there are about fifty, just from overnight and this morning. Crikey Moses, he was right. His PA evidently does handle his whole life.</p><p>There\u2019s everything and everyone in here. His doctor, colleagues, charity requests, invitations ... It\u2019s like a mainline into the universe of Sam. I can see where he buys his shirts (Turnbull &amp; Asser). I can see where he went to university (Durham). I can see the name of his plumber (Dean).</p><p>As I scroll down, I start to I feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve never had so much access to someone else\u2019s phone before. Not my friends\u2019; not even Magnus\u2019s. There are some things you just don\u2019t share. I mean, Magnus has seen every inch of my body, including the dodgy bits, but I would never, ever let him near my phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam\u2019s text messages are randomly mixed up with mine, which feels weird too. I scroll down two messages for me, then about six for Sam, then another for me. All side by side; all touching one another. I\u2019ve never shared an in-box with anyone in my life. I didn\u2019t expect it to feel so ... intimate. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re suddenly sharing an underwear drawer or something.</p><p>Anyway. No big deal. It\u2019s not for long.</p><p>I make my tea and fill a bowl with Shreddies. Then, as I munch, I slowly pick through the messages, working out which ones are for Sam and forwarding them on.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to spy on him or anything. Obviously not. But I have to click on each message in order to forward it, and sometimes my fingers automatically press open by mistake and I catch a glimpse of the text. Just sometimes.</p> <p>Clearly it\u2019s not only his father who\u2019s having a hard time getting in touch with him. He must be really, really bad at answering emails and texts, there are so many plaintive requests to Violet: Is this a good way to reach Sam? ... Hi! Apologies for bothering you, but I have left several messages for Sam ... . Hi, Violet, could you nudge Sam about an email I sent last week? I\u2019ll reprise the main points here ... .</p><p>It\u2019s not like I\u2019m reading through every single email fully or anything. Or scrolling down to read all the previous correspondence. Or critiquing all his answers and rewriting them in my head. After all, it\u2019s none of my business what he writes or doesn\u2019t write. He can do what he likes. It\u2019s a free country. My opinion is neither here nor there\u2014</p><p>God, his replies are abrupt! It\u2019s driving me nuts! Does everything have to be so short? Does he have to be so curt and unfriendly? As I clock yet another brief email, I can\u2019t help exclaiming out loud, \u201cAre you allergic to typing or something?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s like he\u2019s determined to use the least possible words.</p><p>Yes, fine. Sam</p> <p>Done. Sam</p><p>OK, Sam</p><p>Would it kill him to add Best wishes? Or a smiley face? Or say thank you?</p><p>And while I\u2019m on the subject, why can\u2019t he just reply to people? Poor Rachel Elwood is trying to organize an office Fun Run and has asked him twice now if he could lead a team. Why wouldn\u2019t he want to do that? It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s healthy, it raises money for charity\u2014what\u2019s not to love?</p><p>Nor has he replied about accommodation for the company conference in Hampshire next week. It\u2019s at the Chiddingford Hotel, which sounds amazing, and he\u2019s booked into a suite, but he has to specify to someone called Lindy whether he\u2019s still planning to come down late. And he hasn\u2019t.</p><p>Worst of all, his dentist\u2019s office has emailed him about scheduling a checkup four times. Four times.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help glancing back at the previous correspondence, and Violet\u2019s obviously given up trying. Each time she\u2019s made an appointment for him, he\u2019s emailed her: Cancel it. S, and once even, You have to be joking.</p><p>Does he want his teeth to rot?</p><p>By the time I\u2019m leaving for work at eight-forty, a whole new series of emails has arrived. Obviously these people all start work at the crack of dawn. The top one, from Jon Mailer, is entitled What\u2019s the story? That sounds quite intriguing, so as I\u2019m walking along the street, I open it.</p><p>Sam,</p><p>Ran into Ed at the Groucho Club last night, looking worse for wear. All I\u2019ll say is, don\u2019t let him in the same room as Sir Nicholas anytime soon, will you?</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Jon</p><p>Ooh, now I want to know the story too. Who\u2019s Ed, and why was he worse for wear at the Groucho Club?23</p> <p>The second email is from someone called Willow, and as I click on it, my eyes are assaulted by capitals everywhere.</p><p>Violet,</p><p>Let\u2019s be grown-ups about this. You\u2019ve HEARD Sam and me fighting. There\u2019s no point hiding anything from you.</p><p>So, since Sam REFUSES to answer the email I sent half an hour ago, maybe you could be so kind to print this attachment out and PUT IT ON HIS DESK SO HE READS IT?</p><p>Thanks so much.</p><p>Willow</p><p>I stare at the phone in shock, almost wanting to laugh. Willow must be his fianc\u00e9e. Yowzer.</p><p>Her email address is</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>. So she obviously works at White Globe Consulting, but she\u2019s still emailing Sam? Isn\u2019t that odd? Unless maybe they work on different floors. Fair enough. I once emailed Magnus from upstairs to ask him to make me a cup of tea.</p><p>I wonder what\u2019s in the attachment.</p><p>My fingers hesitate as I pause at a pedestrian crossing. It would be wrong to read it. Very, very wrong. I mean, this isn\u2019t some open email cc\u2019ed to loads of people. This is a private document between two people in a relationship. I shouldn\u2019t look at it. It was bad enough reading that email from his father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But on the other hand ... she wants it printed out, doesn\u2019t she?

How?</p><p>The thing is, Sam, sometimes I don\u2019t even know if you have a string. It\u2019s that bad. I DON\u2019T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A STRING.</p> <p>I can see you shaking your head, Mr. Denial.

I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my life.</p><p>I read it over again\u2014and suddenly find myself giggling. I know I shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s not funny. She\u2019s obviously really upset. And I know I\u2019ve said some pretty screwy things to Magnus when I\u2019ve been pissed and hormonal. But I would never, ever put them in an email and get his assistant to print it out</p> <p>My head bobs up in realization. Shit! There\u2019s no Violet anymore. No one\u2019s going to print it out and put it on Sam\u2019s desk. He won\u2019t know about it and he won\u2019t reply and Willow will get even more livid. The awful thing is, this thought makes me want to giggle more.</p><p>I wonder if this is a bad day or if she\u2019s always this intense. I can\u2019t resist typing Willow in the search engine, and a whole series of emails pop up. There\u2019s one from yesterday, with the title Are you trying to fuck me or fuck WITH me, Sam? Or CAN\u2019T YOU DECIDE???, and I get another fit of the giggles. Yikes. They must have one of those up and down relationships. Maybe they throw things at each other and shriek and bellow, then have mad passionate sex in the kitchen\u2014</p><p>Beyonc\u00e9 blasts out from the phone, and I nearly drop it as I see Sam Mobile appear on the screen. I have a mad thought that he\u2019s psychic and knows I\u2019ve been spying on his love life.</p><p>No more snooping, I hastily promise myself. No more Willow searches. I count to three\u2014then press answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi there!\u201d I try to sound relaxed and guiltless, like I was just thinking about something else altogether and not at all imagining him screwing his fianc\u00e9e amongs a pile of broken crockery.</p><p>\u201cDid I have an email from Ned Murdoch this morning?\u201d he launches in without so much as a \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve sent all your emails over. Good morning to you too,\u201d I add brightly. \u201cI\u2019m really well, how about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might have missed one.\u201d He completely ignores my little dig. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m extremely thorough,\u201d I retort pointedly. \u201cBelieve me, everything that\u2019s coming in to this phone, you\u2019re getting. And there wasn\u2019t anything from Ned Murdoch. Someone called Willow just emailed, by the way,\u201d I add casually. \u201cI\u2019ll forward it on. There\u2019s an attachment, which sounded quite important. But obviously I didn\u2019t look at it at all. Or read it or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHrrrmm.\u201d He gives a kind of noncommittal growl. \u201cSo, have you found your ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I admit reluctantly. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll turn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should inform your insurers anyway, you know. They sometimes have a time limit for claiming. Colleague of mine got caught out that way.\u201d</p><p>Insurers? Time limits?</p><p>I suddenly feel clammy with guilt. I\u2019ve given this no thought at all. I haven\u2019t checked up on my insurance or the Tavishes\u2019 insurance or anything. Instead, I\u2019ve been standing at a pedestrian crossing, missing my chance to walk, reading other people\u2019s emails and laughing at them.

It\u2019s me, the girl you don\u2019t want to marry your son, and, guess what? I\u2019ve lost your priceless family ring!</p><p>I\u2019ll give myself twelve more hours, I abruptly decide, pressing the pedestrian button again. Just in case. Just in case.</p><p>And then I\u2019ll tell them.</p><p>I always thought I might be a dentist. Several of my family are dentists, and it always seemed like a pretty decent career. But then, when I was fifteen, my school sent me on a weeklong work experience placement at the physio unit at our local hospital. All the therapists were so enthusiastic about what they did that focusing only on teeth suddenly felt a bit narrow for me. And I\u2019ve never regretted my decision for a moment. It just suits me, being a physio.</p> <p>First Fit Physio Studio is exactly eighteen minutes\u2019 walk from my flat in Balham, past Costa, and next to Greggs, the baker. It\u2019s not the grandest practice in the world\u2014I\u2019d probably earn more if I went to some smart sports center or a big hospital. But I\u2019ve been working there ever since I qualified and can\u2019t imagine working anywhere else. Plus, I work with friends. You wouldn\u2019t give that up in a hurry, would you?</p><p>I arrive at nine o\u2019clock, expecting to have the usual staff meeting. We have one every Thursday morning, where we discuss patients and targets, new therapies, the latest research, stuff like that.24 There\u2019s one particular patient I want to talk about, actually: Mrs. Randall, my sweet sixty-five-year-old with the ligament problem. She\u2019s pretty much recovered\u2014but last week she came in twice, and this week she\u2019s booked three appointments. I\u2019ve told her she just needs to exercise at home with her Dyna-Bands, but she insists she needs my help. I think she\u2019s become totally dependent on us\u2014which might be good for the cash register but is not good for her.</p><p>So I\u2019m quite looking forward to the meeting. But, to my surprise, the meeting room is set up differently from usual. The table has been pulled to one end of the room, with two chairs behind it\u2014and there\u2019s a sole chair facing it in the middle of the room. It looks like an interview setup.</p><p>The reception door pings to signal that someone\u2019s entered, and I turn to see Annalise coming in with a Costa coffee tray. She\u2019s got some complicated braided arrangement in her long blond hair, and she looks like a Greek goddess.</p><p>\u201cHi, Annalise! What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better talk to Ruby.\u201d She gives me a sidelong look, without smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should say.\u201d She takes a sip of cappuccino, eyeing me secretively over the top.</p><p>What\u2019s up now? Annalise\u2019s quite prickly\u2014in fact, she\u2019s a bit of a child. She goes all quiet and sulky, and then it comes out that yesterday you asked her for that file too impatiently and hurt her feelings.</p><p>Ruby is the opposite. She\u2019s got smooth latte-colored skin, a huge, motherly bust, and is packed so full of common sense it\u2019s practically wafting out of her ears. The minute you\u2019re in her company, you feel saner, calmer, jollier, and stronger. No wonder this physio practice has been a success. I mean, Annalise and I are OK at what we do, but Ruby is the star turn. Everyone loves her. Men, women, grannies, kids. She also put up the money for the business,25 so she\u2019s officially my boss.</p><p>\u201cMorning, babe.\u201d Ruby comes breezing out from her treatment room, beaming her usual wide smile. Her hair has been back-combed and pinned in a bun, with intricate twisted sections on either side. Both Annalise and Ruby are totally into their hairdos\u2014it\u2019s almost a competition between them. \u201cNow, look, it\u2019s a real pain, but I have to give you a disciplinary hearing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I gape at her.</p><p>\u201cNot my fault!\u201d She lifts her hands. \u201cI want to get accreditation from this new body, the PFFA. I\u2019ve just been reading the material, and it says if your staff chat up the patients you have to discipline them. We should have done it anyway, you know that, but now I need to have the notes ready for the inspector. We\u2019ll get it done really quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t chat him up,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cHe chatted me up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the panel will decide that, don\u2019t you?\u201d chimes in Annalise forbiddingly. She looks so grave, I feel a tickle of worry. \u201cI told you you\u2019d been unethical,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou should be prosecuted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProsecuted?\u201d I appeal to Ruby. I can\u2019t believe this is happening. Back when Magnus proposed, Ruby said it was such a romantic story she wanted to cry, and that, OK, strictly it was against the rules, but in her opinion love conquered all, and please could she be a bridesmaid? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnnalise, you don\u2019t mean \u2018prosecuted.\u2019 \u201d Ruby rolls her eyes. \u201cCome on.

I know we should have an external person, but I didn\u2019t know who to get. I\u2019ll tell the inspector I had someone lined up and they were ill.\u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cOK, we\u2019ve got twenty minutes. Morning, Angela!\u201d she adds cheerily as our receptionist pushes the front door open. \u201cDon\u2019t let any calls through, OK?\u201d</p><p>Angela just nods and sniffs and dumps her rucksack on the floor. She has a boyfriend in a band, so she\u2019s never very communicative in the mornings.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Poppy,\u201d Ruby says over her shoulder as she leads the way into the meeting room. \u201cI was supposed to give you two weeks\u2019 notice to prepare. You don\u2019t need that, do you? Can we say you had it? Because there\u2019s only a week and a bit till the wedding, so it would mean dragging you away from your honeymoon or leaving it till you\u2019re back, and I really want to get the paperwork done... .\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s ushering me to the sole chair, marooned in the middle of the floor, while she and Annalise take their seats behind the table. Any minute I expect a bright light to shine in my eyes. This is horrible. Everything\u2019s suddenly turned. It\u2019s them against me.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to fire me?\u201d I feel ridiculously panicked.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d Ruby is unscrewing her pen. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe might,\u201d says Annalise, shooting me an ominous look.</p> <p>She\u2019s obviously loving her role as chief henchwoman. I know what this is all about. It\u2019s because I got Magnus and she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing. Annalise\u2019s the beautiful one. Even I want to stare at her all day, and I\u2019m a girl. If you\u2019d said to anyone last year, \u201cWhich of these three will land a guy and be engaged by next summer?\u201d they\u2019d have said immediately, \u201cAnnalise.\u201d</p><p>So I can understand her point of view. She must look in the mirror and see herself (Greek goddess) and then see me (lanky legs, dark hair; best feature\u2014long eyelashes) and think: WTF?</p><p>Plus, as I said, Magnus was originally booked with her. And at the last minute we switched appointments. Which is not my fault.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Ruby looks up from her foolscap pad. \u201cLet\u2019s run over the facts, Miss Wyatt. On December fifteenth last year, you treated a Mr. Magnus Tavish here at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>For what form of injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sprained wrist sustained while skiing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd during this appointment, did he show any ... inappropriate interest in you? Or you in him?\u201d</p><p>I cast my mind back to that first instant Magnus walked into my room. He was wearing a long gray tweed coat, and his tawny hair was glistening with rain and his face was flushed from walking. He was ten minutes late, and he immediately rushed over, clasped both my hands, and said, \u201cI\u2019m most terribly sorry,\u201d in this lovely, well-educated voice.</p><p>\u201cI ... er ... no,\u201d I say defensively. \u201cIt was just a standard appointment.\u201d</p><p>Even as I say this, I know it\u2019s not true. In standard appointments, your heart doesn\u2019t start to pound as you take the patient\u2019s arm. The hairs on the back of your neck don\u2019t rise. You don\u2019t hold on to his hand very slightly longer than you need to.</p><p>Not that I can say any of this. I really would be fired.</p><p>\u201cI treated the patient over the course of a number of appointments.\u201d I try to sound calm and professional. \u201cBy the time we realized our affection for each other, his treatment was over. It was therefore totally ethical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe told me it was love at first sight!\u201d shoots back Annalise. \u201cHow do you explain that ? He told me you were instantly attracted to each other and he wanted to ravish you right there on the couch. He said he\u2019d never known anything so sexy as you in your uniform.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to shoot Magnus. What did he have to say that for?</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d I glower at her. \u201cThat evidence was procured while under the influence of alcohol and in a nonprofessional capacity. It therefore cannot be allowed in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it can! And you are under oath !\u201d She jabs a finger at me.</p><p>\u201cObjection sustained,\u201d Ruby interrupts, and looks up from writing, a distant, wistful look in her eyes. \u201cWas it really love at first sight?\u201d She leans forward, her great big uniformed bosom bulging everywhere. \u201cDid you know ?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and try to visualize that day. I\u2019m not sure what I knew, except I wanted to ravish him on the couch too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so romantic.\u201d Ruby sighs.</p><p>\u201cAnd wrong!\u201d Annalise chimes in sharply. \u201cThe minute he showed any interest in you, you should have said, \u2018Sir, this is inappropriate behavior. I would like this session to end and for you to transfer to another therapist.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, another therapist!\u201d I can\u2019t help a short laugh. \u201cLike you, by any chance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe! Why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if he\u2019d shown interest in you?\u201d</p><p>She lifts her chin proudly. \u201cI would have handled it without compromising my ethical principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was ethical!\u201d I say in outrage. \u201cI was totally ethical!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d She narrows her eyes like a prosecuting barrister. \u201cWhat led you to suggest exchanging appointments with me in the first place, Miss Wyatt? Had you in fact already Googled him and decided you wanted him for yourself?\u201d</p> <p>Aren\u2019t we over this?</p><p>\u201cAnnalise, you wanted to swap appointments! I never suggested anything! I had no idea who he was! So if you feel like you missed out, tough luck. Don\u2019t swap next time!\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Annalise says nothing, She\u2019s getting pinker and pinker in the face.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she bursts out at last, and bangs a fist to her forehead. \u201cI know! I was so stupid. Why did I swap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d cuts in Ruby firmly. \u201cAnnalise, get over it. Magnus obviously wasn\u2019t meant for you, he was meant for Poppy. So what does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Annalise is silent. I can tell she isn\u2019t convinced.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d she mutters at last. \u201cDo you know how many bankers I\u2019ve massaged at the London Marathon? Do you know how much effort I\u2019ve made?\u201d</p><p>Annalise cottoned on to the London Marathon a few years ago, when she was watching it on telly and realized it was stuffed full of fit, motivated guys in their forties, who were probably single because all they did was go running, and, OK, forties was a bit old, but think what kind of salary they must be on.</p><p>So she\u2019s been volunteering as an emergency physiotherapist every year since. She makes a beeline for all the attractive men and works their calf muscles or whatever, while fixing them with her huge blue eyes and telling them she\u2019s always supported that charity too.26</p><p>To be fair, she\u2019s got lots of dates out of it\u2014one guy even took her to Paris\u2014but nothing long-term or serious, which is what she wants. What she won\u2019t admit, of course, is that she\u2019s extremely picky. She pretends that she wants a \u201creally nice, straightforward guy with good values,\u201d but she\u2019s had several of those desperately in love with her and she dumped them, even the really good-looking actor (his stage play ended and he had no other work coming up). What she\u2019s really after is a guy who looks like he\u2019s out of a Gillette commercial, with a massive salary and/or a title. Preferably both. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s so mad about losing Magnus, since he\u2019s Dr. She once asked me if he would become Professor one day and I said probably yes, and she went a kind of green.</p><p>Ruby scribbles something else down, then screws her pen lid on. \u201cWell, I think we\u2019ve covered the facts. Well done, everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to give her a warning or something?\u201d Annalise is still pouting.</p><p>\u201cOh, fair point.\u201d Ruby nods, then clears her throat. \u201cPoppy, don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I shrug.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll put that in writing, show it to the inspector; that\u2019ll shut him up. By the way, did I tell you I\u2019ve found the perfect strapless bra to go under my bridesmaid\u2019s dress?\u201d Ruby beams at me, back to her usual cheery self. \u201cAquamarine satin. It\u2019s lush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds amazing!\u201d I get up and reach for the Costa coffee tray. \u201cIs one of these for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you a flat white,\u201d says Annalise grudgingly. \u201cWith nutmeg.\u201d</p><p>As I take it, Ruby gives a small gasp. \u201cPoppy! Haven\u2019t you found your ring?\u201d</p><p>I look up to see both Annalise and Ruby staring at my left hand.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admit reluctantly. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll turn up somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Annalise has a hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI thought you found it.\u201d Ruby is frowning. \u201cI\u2019m sure somebody said you\u2019d found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really not enjoying their reaction.

Neither of you guys has seen it, have you?\u201d I can\u2019t help asking, even though it\u2019s ridiculous, like they\u2019ll suddenly say, \u201cOh yes, it\u2019s in my bag!\u201d</p><p>They both shrug \u201cno.\u201d Even Annalise is looking sorry for me.</p> <p>Oh God. This is really bad.</p><p>By six o\u2019clock it\u2019s even worse. Annalise has Googled emerald rings.</p><p>Did I ask her to do this? No. I did not. Magnus has never told me how much the ring is worth. I asked him, jokingly, when he first put it on my finger, and he joked back that it was priceless, just like me. It was all very romantic and lovely. We were having dinner at Bluebird, and I had no idea he was going to propose. None.28</p><p>Anyway, the point is, I never knew what the ring cost and I never wanted to know. At the back of my mind I keep trying out lines to Magnus, like, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t realize it was so valuable! You should have told me!\u201d</p><p>Not that I\u2019d have the nerve to say that. I mean, how dumb would you have to be not to realize that an emerald out of a bank vault is worth something? Still, it\u2019s been quite comforting not to have a precise figure in my head.</p><p>But now here\u2019s Annalise, brandishing a sheet of paper she\u2019s printed out from the Internet.29</p> <p>\u201cArt deco, fine-quality emerald, with baguette diamonds,\u201d she\u2019s reading out. \u201cEstimate twenty-five thousand pounds.\u201d</p><p>What? My insides turn to jelly. That can\u2019t be right.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have given me anything that expensive.\u201d My voice is a bit shaky. \u201cAcademics are poor. \u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not poor! Look at his house! His dad\u2019s a celebrity! Look, this one\u2019s thirty grand.\u201d She holds up another sheet. \u201cIt looks exactly like yours. Don\u2019t you think, Ruby?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t look.</p><p>\u201c I never would have let it off my finger,\u201d Annalise adds, arching her eyebrows, and I almost want to hit her.</p><p>\u201c You\u2019re the one who wanted to try it on!\u201d I say furiously. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for you, I\u2019d still have it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t!\u201d she retorts indignantly. \u201cI just tried it on when everyone else did! It was already going round the table.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, whose idea was it, then?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been racking my brains about this again\u2014but if my memory was hazy yesterday, it\u2019s even worse today.</p><p>I\u2019m never going to believe a Poirot mystery again. Never. All those witnesses going, \u201cYes, I remember it was 3:06 pm exactly, because I glanced at the clock as I reached for the sugar tongs, and Lady Favisham was quite clearly sitting on the right-hand side of the fireplace.\u201d</p><p>Bollocks. They have no idea where Lady Favisham was, they just don\u2019t want to admit it in front of Poirot. I\u2019m amazed he gets anywhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d I turn away before Annalise can taunt me with any more expensive rings.</p><p>\u201cTo tell Magnus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding meeting with Lucinda first. Then Magnus and his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet us know what happens. Text us!\u201d Annalise frowns. \u201cHey, that reminds me, Poppy: How come you changed your number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. Well, I went out of the hotel to get a better signal and I was holding out my phone\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off. On second thought, I can\u2019t be bothered to get into the whole story of the mugging and the phone in the bin and Sam Roxton. It\u2019s all too way-out, and I haven\u2019t got the energy.</p><p>Instead, I shrug. \u201cYou know. Lost my phone. Got another one.

But I only ever think that thought very quietly to myself, because Lucinda is an old family friend of the Tavishes. Every time I mention her, Magnus says, \u201cAre you two getting along?\u201d in raised, hopeful tones, like we\u2019re two endangered pandas who have to make a baby.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Lucinda. It\u2019s just that she stresses me out. She sends me all these bulletins by text the whole time, of what she\u2019s doing and where, and keeps telling me what an effort she\u2019s making on my behalf, like the sourcing of the napkins, which was the hugest saga and took her forever and three trips to a fabric warehouse in Walthamstow.</p> <p>Also, her priorities seem a little screwy. She hired an \u201cIT wedding specialist\u201d at great expense, who set up whizzy things like a text alert system to give all the guests updates30 and a webpage where guests can register what outfit they\u2019re wearing and avoid \u201cunfortunate clashes.\u201d31 But while she was doing all that, she didn\u2019t get back to the caterers we wanted, and we nearly lost them.</p><p>We\u2019re meeting in the lobby of Claridge\u2019s\u2014Lucinda loves hotel lobbies; don\u2019t ask me why. I sit there patiently for twenty minutes, drinking weak black tea, wishing I\u2019d canceled, and feeling sicker and sicker at the thought of seeing Magnus\u2019s parents. I\u2019m wondering if I might actually have to go to the ladies\u2019 and be ill\u2014when she suddenly appears, all flying raven hair and Calvin Klein perfume and six mood boards under her arm. Her suede spiky kitten heels are tapping on the marble floor and her pink cashmere coat is billowing out behind her like a pair of wings.</p><p>Trailing in her wake is Clemency, her \u201cassistant\u201d. (If an unpaid eighteen-year-old can be called an assistant. I\u2019d call her slave labor.) Clemency is very posh and very sweet and terrified of Lucinda. She answered Lucinda\u2019s ad in The Lady for an intern and keeps telling me how great it is to learn the ropes firsthand from an experienced professional.32</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been talking to the vicar. Those arrangements aren\u2019t going to work. The wretched pulpit has to stay where it is.\u201d Lucinda descends into a chair in a leggy, Joseph-trousered sprawl, and the mood boards slide out of her grasp and all over the floor. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why people can\u2019t be more helpful. I mean, what are we going to do now? And I haven\u2019t heard back from the caterer ... \u201d</p><p>I can barely concentrate on what she\u2019s saying. I\u2019m suddenly wishing I\u2019d arranged to meet Magnus first, on my own, to tell him about the ring. Then we could have faced his parents together. Is it too late? Could I quickly text him on the way?</p> <p>\u201c ... and I still haven\u2019t got a trumpeter.\u201d Lucinda exhales sharply, two lacquered nails to her forehead. \u201cThere\u2019s so much to do. It\u2019s insane. Insane. It would have helped if Clemency had typed out the order of service properly,\u201d she adds, a little savagely.</p><p>Poor Clemency flushes beet-red and I shoot her a sympathetic smile. It\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s severely dyslexic and put hymen instead of hymn and the whole thing had to be redone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there!\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, after this is over I\u2019m going to need a week in a spa. Have you seen my hands ?\u201d Lucinda pushes them toward me. \u201cThat\u2019s stress!\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about\u2014her hands look perfectly normal to me. But I stare at them obediently.</p><p>\u201cYou see? Wrecked. All for your wedding, Poppy! Clemency, order me a G&amp;T.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Absolutely.\u201d Clemency leaps eagerly to her feet.</p><p>I try to ignore a tiny rub of irritation. Lucinda\u2019s always throwing little references like that into the conversation: \u201cAll for your wedding.\u201d \u201cJust to make you happy, Poppy!\u201d \u201cThe bride\u2019s always right!\u201d</p><p>She can sound quite pointed sometimes, which I find disconcerting.

But I don\u2019t want to say anything, because she\u2019s Magnus\u2019s old friend and everything.</p><p>\u201cLucinda, I was wondering, have we sorted out the cars yet?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>There\u2019s an ominous silence. I can tell that a wave of fury is rising inside Lucinda, from the way her nose starts to twitch. At last it erupts, just as poor Clemency arrives back.</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell. Oh fucking ...

However much I run myself into the ground, it goes on and on and on\u2014&gt;\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, shall I do the cars?\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI\u2019m sure I can sort them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d Lucinda seems to wake up. \u201cCould you do that? It\u2019s just, there\u2019s only one of me, you know, and I have spent the entire week working on details, all for your wedding, Poppy.\u201d</p> <p>She looks so stressed out, I feel a pang of guilt.</p><p>\u201cYes! No problem. I\u2019ll go on yellow pages or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your hair coming along, Poppy?\u201d Lucinda suddenly focuses on my head, and I silently will my hair to grow another centimeter, very quickly.</p><p>\u201cNot bad! I\u2019m sure it will go in the chignon. Definitely.\u201d I try to sound more positive than I feel.</p><p>Lucinda has told me about a hundred times how shortsighted and foolish it was to cut my hair to above the shoulder when I was about to become engaged.33 She also told me at the wedding-dress shop that with my pale skin,34 a white dress would never work and I should wear lime green. For my wedding. Luckily the wedding-dress-shop owner chimed in and said Lucinda was speaking nonsense: My dark hair and eyes would set off the white beautifully. So I chose to believe her instead.</p> <p>The G&amp;T arrives and Lucinda takes a deep slug. I take another sip of tepid black tea. Poor old Clemency hasn\u2019t got anything, but she looks like she\u2019s trying to blend into her chair and not attract any attention at all.</p><p>\u201cAnd ... you were going to find out about confetti?\u201d I add cautiously. \u201cBut I can do that too,\u201d I backtrack quickly at Lucinda\u2019s expression. \u201cI\u2019ll phone the vicar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Lucinda breathes out sharply. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate that! Because there is only one of me and I can only be in one place at once\u2014\u201d She breaks off abruptly as her gaze alights on my hand. \u201cWhere\u2019s your ring, Poppy? Oh my God, haven\u2019t you found it yet?\u201d</p><p>As she lifts her eyes, she looks so thunderstruck, I start to feel sick again.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But it\u2019ll turn up soon. I\u2019m sure it will. The hotel staff are all looking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t told Magnus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will!\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t it a really important family piece?\u201d Lucinda\u2019s hazel eyes are wide. \u201cWon\u2019t they be livid?\u201d</p><p>Is she trying to give me a nervous breakdown?</p><p>My phone buzzes and I grab it, grateful for the distraction. Magnus has just sent me a text which dashes my secret hope that his parents would suddenly catch gastric flu and have to cancel:</p><p>Dinner at 8, whole family here, can\u2019t wait to see you!</p><p>\u201cIs that your new phone?\u201d Lucinda frowns critically at it. \u201cDid you get my forwarded texts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d I nod. Only about thirty-five of them, all clogging up my in-box. When she heard I\u2019d lost my phone, Lucinda insisted on forwarding all her recent texts to me, just so I didn\u2019t \u201cdrop the ball.\u201d To be fair, it was quite a good idea. I got Magnus to forward all his most recent messages too, and the girls at work.</p><p>Ned Murdoch, whoever he is, has also finally contacted Sam. I\u2019ve been looking out for that email all day. I glance at it distractedly, but it doesn\u2019t seem particularly earth-shattering to me. Re: Ellerton\u2019s bid. Sam, hi. A few points. You\u2019ll see from the attachment, blah blah blah.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019d better send it on straightaway. I press forward and make sure it\u2019s gone through. Then I type a quick reply to Magnus, my fingers fumbling with nerves.</p><p>Great! Can\u2019t wait to see your parents!!!! So exciting!!!! PS: Could we meet outside first? Something I want to talk about. Just a really tiny thing. Xxxxxxxxx</p><p>22 OK, it wasn\u2019t a couple of texts. It was about seven. But I only pressed send on five of them.</p><p>23 Poirot would probably have worked it out already.</p><p>24 There are only three of us, and we\u2019ve known each other for yonks. So occasionally we lurch off onto other areas like our boyfriends and the Zara sale.</p><p>25 Or, rather, her dad did. He already owns a string of photocopy shops.</p><p>26 She also completely ignores all the poor women with twisted ankles. If you\u2019re a girl, never do the marathon with Annalise on duty.</p><p>27 It was an emergency, in my defense. Natasha had split up with her boyfriend. And it\u2019s not like the patient could see what I was doing.

I\u2019m staring up at the Tavishes\u2019 house and swallowing hard, over and over again, willing myself to move forward.</p><p>Perspective, Poppy. It\u2019s only a ring.</p><p>It\u2019s only your prospective in-laws.</p><p>It was only a \u201cfalling-out.\u201d According to Magnus,35 they never actually said straight out they didn\u2019t want him to marry me. They only implied it. And maybe they\u2019ve changed their minds!</p><p>Plus, I have discovered one tiny positive. My home insurance policy will pay out for losses, apparently. So that\u2019s something. I\u2019m even wondering whether to start the ring conversation via insurance and how handy it is. \u201cYou know, Wanda, I was reading an HSBC leaflet the other day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh God, who am I kidding? There\u2019s no way to salvage this. It\u2019s a nightmare. Let\u2019s just get it over with.</p> <p>My phone bleeps and I take it out of my pocket for old times\u2019 sake. I\u2019ve given up hoping for a miracle.</p><p>\u201cYou have one new message,\u201d comes the familiar, unhurried tone of the voice-mail woman.</p><p>I feel like I know this woman, she\u2019s talked to me so often. How many people have listened to her, desperate for her to hurry up, their hearts pounding with fear or hope? Yet she always sounds equally unfussed, like she doesn\u2019t even care what you\u2019re about to hear. You should be able to choose different options for different kinds of news, so she could start off: \u201cGuess what! Ace news! Listen to your voice mail! Yay!\u201d Or: \u201cSit down, love. Get a drink. You\u2019ve got a message and it\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><p>I press 1, shift the mobile to the other hand, and start trudging again. The message was left while I was on the tube. It\u2019s probably just Magnus, asking where I am.</p><p>\u201cHello, this is the Berrow Hotel, with a message for Poppy Wyatt. Miss Wyatt, it appears your ring was found yesterday. However, due to the chaos of the fire alarm\u2014\u201d</p><p>What? What?</p><p>Joy is whooshing through me like a sparkler. I can\u2019t listen properly. I can\u2019t take the words in. They\u2019ve found it!</p><p>I\u2019ve already abandoned the message. I\u2019m on speed-dial to the concierge. I love him.

You\u2019re a star! Shall I come straight round and get it?\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Wyatt,\u201d he interrupts me. \u201cDid you listen to the message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... Some of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid ... \u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we are not presently sure of the ring\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>I stop dead and peer at the phone. Did he just say what I thought he did?</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d found it.\u201d I\u2019m trying to stay calm. \u201cHow can you not be sure of its whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to one of our staff, a cleaner waitress did find an emerald ring on the carpet of the ballroom during the fire alarm and handed it to our guest manager, Mrs. Fairfax. However, we are uncertain as to what happened after that. We have been unable to find it in the safe or in any of our usual secure locations. We are deeply sorry, and will do our utmost to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, talk to Mrs. Fairfax!\u201d I try to control my impatience. \u201cFind out what she did with it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Unfortunately, she has gone on holiday, and despite our best endeavors, we have been unable to contact her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she pinched it?\u201d I say in horror.</p><p>I\u2019ll find her. Whatever it takes. Detectives, police, Interpol ... I\u2019m already standing in the courtroom, pointing at the ring in a plastic evidence bag, while a middle\u2013aged woman, tanned from her Costa del Sol hideout, glowers at me from the dock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMrs. Fairfax has been a faithful employee for thirty years and has handled many valuable artifacts belonging to guests.\u201d He sounds slightly offended. \u201cI find it very hard to believe that she would have done such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it must be somewhere in the hotel?\u201d I feel a glimmer of hope.</p><p>\u201cThat is what we are endeavoring to find out.

Isn\u2019t it?</p><p>Except that I still don\u2019t have the ring safely on my finger. Everyone will still be worried.

Logically and ethically. If the ring isn\u2019t actually lost ...</p> <p>I passed a Boots on the high street, about four hundred yards back. Almost without knowing what I\u2019m doing, I retrace my steps. I ignore the shop assistant who tries to tell me they\u2019re closing. My head down, I make my way to the first-aid counter. There\u2019s a glove thing you pull on, and some rolls of adhesive bandage. I\u2019ll get it all.</p><p>Ten minutes later I\u2019m striding up the hill again. My hand is swathed in bandages, and you can\u2019t tell whether I\u2019m wearing a ring or not, and I don\u2019t even have to lie. I can say, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to wear a ring with a burned hand.\u201d Which is true.</p><p>I\u2019m nearly at the house when my phone bleeps and a text from Sam Roxton pops into my in-box.</p><p>Where\u2019s the attachment?</p><p>Typical. No \u201chello,\u201d no explanation. He just expects me to know what he\u2019s on about.</p><p>What do you mean?</p> <p>The email from Ned Murdoch. There was no attachment.</p><p>That\u2019s not my fault! I just sent on the email. They must have forgotten to put it on. Why don\u2019t you ask them to send it again, WITH the attachment? Directly to your computer?</p><p>I know I sound a bit exasperated, and of course he instantly picks up on it.</p><p>This phone-sharing was your idea, if you remember. If you\u2019re tired of it, just return my phone to my office.</p><p>Hurriedly I text back:</p><p>No, no! It\u2019s OK. If it comes through, I\u2019ll forward it. Don\u2019t worry. I thought you were getting emails transferred to your office???</p><p>Techies said they\u2019d sort it asap. But they are liars.</p><p>There\u2019s a short pause, then he texts:</p> <p>Got the ring, btw?</p><p>Nearly. Hotel found it, but then lost it again.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>I know.</p><p>By now I\u2019ve stopped walking and am leaning against a wall. I know I\u2019m spinning out time before I have to go into the house, but I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s quite comforting, having this virtual conversation through the ether with someone who doesn\u2019t know Magnus or me, or anybody. After a few moments I text in a confessional rush:</p><p>Am not telling my in-laws have lost ring. Do you think that\u2019s really bad?</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a bit\u2014then he replies:</p><p>Why should you tell them?</p><p>What kind of ridiculous question is that ? I roll my eyes and type:</p><p>It\u2019s their ring!</p><p>Almost at once, his reply comes beeping in.</p><p>Not their ring. Your ring. None of their business. No big deal.</p><p>How can he write No big deal ? As I text back, I\u2019m jabbing the keyboard crossly.</p><p>Is family bloody HEIRLOOM. Am about to have dinner with them right now. They will expect to see ring on my finger. Is huge deal, thank you.</p><p>For a while there\u2019s silence, and I think he\u2019s given up on our conversation. Then, just as I\u2019m about to move on, another text beeps into the phone.</p><p>How will you explain missing ring?</p><p>I have a moment\u2019s internal debate. Why not get a second opinion? Lining up the screen carefully, I take a photo of my bandaged hand and MMS it to him. Five seconds later he replies:</p><p>You cannot be serious.</p><p>I feel a twinge of resentment and find myself typing:</p><p>What would YOU do, then?</p><p>I\u2019m half-hoping he might have some brilliant idea I hadn\u2019t thought of. But his next text just says:</p><p>This is why men don\u2019t wear rings.</p><p>Great. Well, that\u2019s really helpful. I\u2019m about to type something sarcastic back, when a second text arrives:</p><p>It looks phony. Take off one bandage.</p><p>I stare at my hand in dismay.

We\u2019re out.\u201d He stops in front of me and rests two hands on my shoulders, his brown eyes regarding me in tender amusement. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Putting the evil moment off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laugh defensively. \u201cOf course not!

You have to stop worrying about my parents. They\u2019ll love you when they get to know you properly. I\u2019ll make sure they do. We\u2019re going to have a fun evening. OK? Just relax and be yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d I nod at last, and he squeezes me, then glances at my bandage.</p><p>\u201cHand still bad? Poor you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even mention the ring. I feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe this evening will be OK, after all.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you told your parents about the rehearsal? Tomorrow evening at the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re all set.\u201d</p><p>As I walk along, I savor the thought of it. The ancient stone church. The organ playing as I walk in. The vows.</p> <p>I know some brides are all about the music or the flowers or the dress. But I\u2019m all about the vows. For better, for worse ... For richer, for poorer ... And thereto I plight thee my troth ... . All my life, I\u2019ve heard these magical words. At family weddings, in movie scenes, at royal weddings even. The same words, over and over, like poetry handed down through the centuries. And now we\u2019re going to say them to each other. It makes my spine tingle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so looking forward to saying our vows,\u201d I can\u2019t help saying, even though I\u2019ve said this to him before, approximately a hundred times.</p><p>There was a very short time, just after we\u2019d got engaged, when Magnus seemed to think we\u2019d be getting married in a register office. He\u2019s not exactly religious, nor are his parents. But as soon as I\u2019d explained exactly how much I\u2019d been looking forward to saying the church vows all my life, he backtracked and said he couldn\u2019t think of anything more wonderful.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He squeezes my waist. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t mind doing the old words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweets, I think they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I sigh happily. \u201cSo romantic.\u201d</p><p>Every time I imagine Magnus and myself in front of the altar, hands joined, saying those words to each other in clear, resonant voices, it seems like nothing else matters.</p> <p>But as we approach the house twenty minutes later, my glow of security starts to ebb away. The Tavishes are definitely back. The whole house is lit up, and I can hear opera blasting out of the windows. I suddenly remember that time Antony asked me what I thought of Tannhauser and I said I didn\u2019t smoke.</p><p>Oh God. Why didn\u2019t I do a crash course on opera?</p><p>Magnus swings the front door open, then clicks his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Forgot to call Dr. Wheeler. I\u2019ll only be a couple of minutes.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t believe this. He\u2019s bounding up the stairs, toward the study. He can\u2019t leave me.</p><p>\u201cMagnus.\u201d I try not to sound too panicked.</p><p>\u201cJust go through! My parents are in the kitchen. Oh, I got you something for our honeymoon. Open it!\u201d He blows me a kiss and disappears round the corner.</p><p>There\u2019s a huge beribboned box on the hall ottoman. Wow. I know this shop and it\u2019s expensive. I tug it open, ripping the expensive pale-green tissue paper, to find a gray-and-white-printed Japanese kimono. It\u2019s absolutely stunning and even has a matching camisole.</p><p>On impulse, I duck into the little front sitting room, which no one ever uses. I take off my top and cardigan, slip the camisole on, then replace my clothes. It\u2019s slightly too big\u2014but still gorgeous. All silky-smooth and luxurious-feeling.</p><p>It is a lovely present. It really is. But, to be honest, what I would prefer right now is Magnus by my side, his hand firmly in mine, giving me moral support. I fold the dressing gown up and stuff it back amid the torn tissue, taking my time.</p><p>Still no sign of Magnus. I can\u2019t put this off any longer.</p><p>\u201cMagnus?\u201d comes Wanda\u2019s high-pitched, distinctive voice from the kitchen. \u201cIs that you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s me!

Her wild hair has been freshly hennaed, and she\u2019s wearing one of her odd, capacious dresses made out of what looks like parachute silk, together with rubber-soled Mary Janes. Her skin is as pale and unadorned as ever, although she\u2019s put on an inaccurate slash of red lipstick.36 Her cheek brushes against mine and I catch a whiff of stale perfume. \u201cThe fi-an-c\u00e9e !\u201d She enunciates the word with care bordering on ridicule. \u201cThe betrothed. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThe affianced, \u201d chimes in Antony, rising from his seat at the table. He\u2019s wearing the tweed jacket he wears on the back of his book, and he surveys me with the same off-putting gimlet-eyed smile. The oriole weds his mottled mate; The lily\u2019s bride o\u2019 the bee. Another for your collection, darling?\u201d he adds to Wanda.</p><p>\u201cQuite right! I need a pen. Where\u2019s a pen ?\u201d Wanda starts searching among the papers already littering the countertop. \u201cThe damage that has been done to the feminist cause by ridiculous, lazy-minded anthropomorphism. Weds his mottled mate. I ask you, Poppy!\u201d She appeals to me, and I give a rictus smile.</p><p>I have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. None. Why can\u2019t they just say, \u201cHello, how are you?\u201d like normal people?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your view on the cultural response to anthropomorphism? From a young woman\u2019s perspective?\u201d</p><p>My stomach jumps as I realize Antony is looking my way. Oh my holy aunt. Is he talking to me?</p><p>Anthro-what?</p><p>I feel like if only he would write down his questions and give them to me with five minutes to look over (and maybe a dictionary), I\u2019d have half a chance to come up with something intelligent. I mean, I did go to university. I have written essays with long words in them and a thesis.37 My English teacher even once said I had a \u201cquesting mind.\u201d38</p><p>But I don\u2019t have five minutes. He\u2019s waiting for me to speak. And there\u2019s something about his bright gaze that turns my tongue to dust.</p><p>\u201cWell ... um ... I think it\u2019s ... it\u2019s ... an interesting debate,\u201d I say feebly. \u201cVery crucial in this day and age. So, how was your flight?\u201d I add quickly. Maybe we can get on to movies or something.</p> <p>\u201cUnspeakable.\u201d Wanda looks up from where she\u2019s scribbling. \u201c Why do people fly? Why? \u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s expecting an answer or not.</p><p>\u201cUm ... for holidays and stuff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already started making notes for a paper on the subject,\u201d Wanda interrupts me. \u201c \u2018The Migration Impulse.\u2019 Why do humans feel compelled to pitch themselves across the globe? Are we following the ancient migratory paths of our ancestors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you read Burroughs?\u201d Antony says to her, with interest. \u201c Not the book; the PhD thesis.\u201d</p><p>No one\u2019s even offered me a drink yet. Quietly, trying to blend in with the background, I creep into the kitchen area and pour myself a glass of wine. I\u2019ve tuned out the conversation about migration. But suddenly Wanda addresses me directly.</p><p>\u201cI gather Magnus gave you his grandmother\u2019s emerald ring?\u201d</p><p>I jump in panic. We\u2019re onto the ring already. Is there an edge to Wanda\u2019s voice or did I make that up? Does she know ?</p> <p>\u201cYes! It\u2019s ... it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d My hands are trembling so much, I nearly spill my wine.</p><p>Wanda says nothing, just glances at Antony and raises her eyebrows meaningfully.</p><p>What was that for? Why an eyebrow raise? What are they thinking? Shit, shit, they\u2019ll ask to see the ring, it\u2019s all going to implode.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s difficult to wear a ring with a burned hand,\u201d I blurt out desperately.</p><p>There. It wasn\u2019t a lie. Exactly.</p><p>\u201cBurned?\u201d Wanda swings round and takes in my bandaged hand. \u201cMy dear girl! You must see Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul.\u201d Antony nods. \u201cCertainly. Ring him, Wanda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur neighbor,\u201d she explains. \u201cDermatologist. The best.\u201d She\u2019s already on the phone, winding the old-fashioned curly cord around her wrist. \u201cHe\u2019s only across the street.\u201d</p><p>Across the street?</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed with horror. How have things gone so wrong so quickly? I have a vision of some brisk man with a doctor\u2019s bag coming into the kitchen and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s have a look,\u2019 and everyone crowding round to see as I take off my bandages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Should I dash upstairs and find a match?

He\u2019s not in.\u201d She replaces the receiver.</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d I manage, as Magnus appears through the kitchen door, followed by Felix, who says, \u201cHi, Poppy,\u201d and then immerses himself back in the textbook he was reading.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d Magnus looks from me to his parents, as though trying to assess the mood of the room. \u201cHow are you all doing? Isn\u2019t Poppy looking even more beautiful than usual? Isn\u2019t she just lovely?\u201d He bunches up my hair and then lets it fall down again.</p> <p>I wish he wouldn\u2019t. I know he\u2019s trying to be nice, but it makes me cringe.

Wanda turns to me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to see if we can\u2019t get papers published in the same journal. All six of us, including Conrad and Margot. Family effort, you see. Felix on indexing. Everyone involved!\u201d</p> <p>Everyone except me, flashes through my mind.</p><p>Which is ridiculous. Because do I want to write an academic paper in some obscure journal which no one ever reads? No. Could I? No. Do I even know what cultural genesis is? No.39</p><p>\u201cYou know, Poppy has published in her field,\u201d Magnus suddenly announces, as though hearing my thoughts and leaping to my defense. \u201cHaven\u2019t you, darling?\u201d He smiles proudly at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be modest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve published?\u201d Antony wakes up and peers at me with more attention than he ever has before. \u201cAh. Now, that\u2019s interesting. Which journal?\u201d</p><p>I stare helplessly at Magnus. What\u2019s he talking about?</p><p>\u201cYou remember!\u201d he prompts me. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d had something in the physiotherapy periodical?\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. No.</p><p>I will kill Magnus. How could he bring that up?</p><p>Antony and Wanda are both waiting for me to reply. Even Felix has looked up with interest. They\u2019re obviously expecting me to announce a breakthrough in the cultural influence of physiotherapy on nomadic tribes or something.</p><p>\u201cIt was Physiotherapists\u2019 Weekly Roundup, \u201d I mumble at last, staring at my feet. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a periodical. More of a ... a magazine. They published a letter of mine once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it a piece of research?\u201d says Wanda.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cIt was about when patients have BO. I said maybe we should wear gas masks. It was ... you know. Supposed to be funny.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>I\u2019m so mortified I can\u2019t even raise my head.</p> <p>\u201cYou did write a thesis for your degree, though,\u201d ventures Felix. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me once?\u201d I turn in surprise and he\u2019s looking at me with an earnest, encouraging gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes. I mean ... it wasn\u2019t published or anything.\u201d I shrug awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to read it one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I smile\u2014but, honestly, this is pitiful. Of course he doesn\u2019t want to read it; he\u2019s just trying to be nice. Which is sweet of him but makes me feel even more tragic, since I\u2019m twenty-nine and he\u2019s seventeen. Plus, if he\u2019s trying to boost my confidence in front of his parents, it hasn\u2019t worked, because they\u2019re not even listening.</p><p>\u201cOf course, humor is a form of expression which one should factor into one\u2019s cultural narrative,\u201d says Wanda doubtfully. \u201cI think Jacob C. Goodson has done some interesting work on \u2018Why Humans Joke.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it was \u2018 Do Humans Joke,\u2019 \u201d corrects Antony. \u201cSurely his thesis was that ...\u201d</p><p>They\u2019re off again. I breathe out, my cheeks still burning. I cannot cope. I want someone to ask about holidays, or EastEnders, or anything but this.</p><p>I mean, I love Magnus and everything. But I\u2019ve been here five minutes and I\u2019m a nervous wreck. How am I going to survive Christmas every year? What if our children are all superbright and I can\u2019t understand what they\u2019re saying and they look down on me because I haven\u2019t got a PhD?</p><p>There\u2019s an acrid smell in the air, and suddenly I realize the Bolognese is burning. Wanda is standing there by the stove, wittering away about Aristotle, not even noticing. Gently, I take the spoon out of her grasp and start to stir. Thank God you don\u2019t need a Nobel Prize to do this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least saving the supper made me feel useful. But half an hour later we\u2019re all sitting round the table, and I\u2019m back to my speechless panic mode.</p><p>No wonder Antony and Wanda don\u2019t want me to marry Magnus. They obviously think I\u2019m a total dimbo. We\u2019re halfway through the Bolognese, and I haven\u2019t uttered a single word. It\u2019s too hard. The conversation is like a juggernaut. Or maybe a symphony. Yes. And I\u2019m the flute. And I do have a tune, and I\u2019d quite like to play it, but there\u2019s no conductor to bring me in. So I keep drawing breath, then chickening out.</p><p>\u201c ... the commissioning editor unfortunately saw otherwise. So there will be no new edition of my book.\u201d Antony makes a rueful, clicking sound. \u201cTant pis.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m alert. For once I actually understand the conversation and have something to say!</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible!\u201d I chime in supportively. \u201cWhy won\u2019t they publish a new edition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need the readership. They need the demand.\u201d Antony gives a theatrical sigh. \u201cAh, well. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters!\u201d I feel fired up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all write to the editor and pretend to be readers and say how brilliant the book is and demand a new edition?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already planning the letters. Dear Sir, I am shocked that a new edition of this wonderful book has not been published. We could print them in different fonts, post them in different areas of the country\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd would you personally buy a thousand copies?\u201d Antony regards me with that hawklike stare.</p> <p>\u201cI ... er ... \u201d I hesitate, stymied. \u201cMaybe ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, unfortunately, Poppy, if the publisher printed a thousand books which did not sell, then I would be in a worse boat than ever.\u201d He gives me a fierce smile. \u201cDo you see?\u201d</p><p>I feel totally squashed and stupid.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I mumble. \u201cYes. I ... I see. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Trying to keep my composure, I start clearing the plates. Magnus is sketching some argument out for Felix on a piece of paper, and I\u2019m not sure he even heard. He gives me an absent smile and squeezes my bum as I pass. Which doesn\u2019t make me feel that much better, to be honest.</p><p>But as we sit back down for pudding, Magnus tinkles his fork and stands up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to announce a toast to Poppy,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cAnd welcome her to the family. As well as being beautiful, she\u2019s caring, funny, and a wonderful person. I\u2019m a very lucky man.\u201d</p><p>He looks around the table as though daring anyone to disagree with him, and I shoot him a grateful little smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d also like to say a big welcome back to Mum and Dad.\u201d Magnus raises a glass, and they both nod. \u201cWe missed you while you were away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d chimed in Felix, and Wanda gives a bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t, you terrible boy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd finally \u201d\u2014Magnus tinkles his glass again to get attention\u2014\u201cof course, happy birthday to Mum! Many happy returns of the day, from all of us.\u201d He blows her a kiss across the table.</p><p>What? What did he just say?</p><p>My smile has frozen on my lips.</p> <p>\u201cHear, hear!\u201d Antony raises his glass. \u201cHappy birthday, Wanda, my love.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s his mother\u2019s birthday ? But he didn\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t have a card. I don\u2019t have a gift. How could he do this to me?</p><p>Men are crap.</p><p>Felix has produced a parcel from under his chair and is handing it to Wanda.</p><p>\u201cMagnus,\u201d I whisper desperately as he sits down. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me it was your mother\u2019s birthday. You never said a word! You should have told me!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m almost gibbering with panic. My first meeting with his parents since we got engaged, and they don\u2019t like me, and now this.</p><p>Magnus looks astonished. \u201cSweets, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>How can he be so obtuse?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have bought her a present !\u201d I say under cover of Wanda exclaiming, \u201cWonderful, Felix!\u201d over some ancient book which she\u2019s unwrapping.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Magnus waves a hand. \u201cShe won\u2019t mind. Stop stressing. You\u2019re an angel and everyone loves you. Did you like the mug, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d I can\u2019t even follow what he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cThe Only Just Married mug. I left it on the hall stand? For our honeymoon?\u201d he prompts at my nonplussed expression. \u201cI told you about it! Quite fun, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see any mug.\u201d I stare blankly at him. \u201cI thought you\u2019d given me that big box with ribbons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat big box?\u201d he says, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cAnd now, my dear,\u201d Antony is saying self-importantly to Wanda, \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, I\u2019ve rather splashed out on you this year. If you\u2019ll give me a minute ... \u201d</p><p>He\u2019s getting up and heading out to the hall.</p><p>Oh God. My insides feel watery. No. Please. No.</p> <p>\u201cI think ... \u201d I begin, but my voice won\u2019t work properly. \u201cI think I might possibly ... by mistake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c What the\u2014 \u201d Antony\u2019s voice resounds from the hall. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to this?\u201d</p><p>A moment later he\u2019s in the room, holding the box. It\u2019s all messed up. Torn tissue paper is everywhere. The kimono is falling out.</p><p>My head is pulsing with blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d I can barely get the words out. \u201cI thought ... I thought it was for me. So I ... I opened it.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s a deathly silence. Every face is stunned, including Magnus\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSweets ... \u201d he begins feebly, then peters out as though he can\u2019t think what to say.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry!\u201d says Wanda briskly. \u201cGive it to me. I don\u2019t mind about the wrapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there was another thing!\u201d Antony is poking the tissue paper testily. \u201cWhere\u2019s the other bit? Was it in there?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I realize what he\u2019s talking about and give a little inward whimper. Every time I think things can\u2019t get worse, they plummet. They find new, ghastly depths.</p><p>\u201cI think ... Do you mean\u201d\u2014I\u2019m stuttering, my face beet-red\u2014\u201cThis?\u201d I pull a bit of the camisole out from under my top and everyone gazes at it, thunderstruck.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting at the dinner table, wearing my future mother-in-law\u2019s underwear. It\u2019s like some twisted dream that you wake up from and think: Crikey Moses! Thank God that didn\u2019t really happen!</p><p>The faces round the table are all motionless and jaw-dropped, like a row of versions of that painting \u201cThe Scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll dry-clean it,\u201d I whisper huskily at last. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>OK. So this evening has gone about as hideously as it possibly could. There\u2019s only one solution, which is to keep drinking wine until my nerves have been numbed or I pass out. Whichever comes first.</p><p>Supper is over, and everyone\u2019s got over the camisole incident. Kind of.</p><p>In fact, they\u2019ve decided to make a family joke out of it. Which is sweet of them but means that Antony keeps making ponderously funny remarks like, \u201cShall we have some chocolates? Unless Poppy\u2019s already eaten them all ?\u201d And I know I should have a sense of humor, but, every time, I flinch.</p><p>Now we\u2019re sitting on the ancient bumpy sofas in the drawing room, playing Scrabble. The Tavishes are complete Scrabble nuts. They have a special board that spins around, and posh wooden tiles, and even a leather-bound book where they write down the scores, dating back to 1998. Wanda is the current winner, with Magnus a close second.</p><p>Antony went first and put down OUTSTEP (74 points). Wanda made IRIDIUMS (65 points). Felix made CARYATID (80 points). Magnus made CONTUSED (65 points).40 And I made STAR (5 points).</p> <p>In my family, STAR would be a good word. Five points would be a pretty decent score. You wouldn\u2019t get pitying looks and clearing of throats and feel like a loser.</p><p>I don\u2019t often think back about past times or reminisce. It\u2019s not really my thing. But sitting here, rigid with failure, hunching my knees, inhaling the musty Tavish smells of books and kilims and old wood fire, I can\u2019t help it. Just a chink. Just a tiny window of memory. Us in the kitchen. Me and my little brothers, Toby and Tom, eating toast and Marmite round the Scrabble board. I remember it distinctly; I can even taste the Marmite. Toby and Tom had got so frustrated, they made a load of extra tiles out of paper and decided you could have as many as you liked. The whole room was covered in cutout squares of paper with Biro letters scrawled on them. Tom gave himself about six Z s and Toby had ten E s And they still only scored about four points per turn and ended up in a scuffle, yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair! It\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>I feel a rush of tears behind my eyes and blink furiously. I\u2019m being stupid. Ridiculous. Number one, this is my new family and I\u2019m trying to integrate with them. Number two, Toby and Tom are both away at college now. They have deep voices and Tom has a beard. We never play Scrabble. I don\u2019t even know where the set is. Number three\u2014</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Yes! I\u2019m just ... working it out.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re into the second round. Antony has extended OUTSTEP into OUTSTEPPED. Wanda has simultaneously made both OD 41 and OVARY. Felix put down ELICIT, and Magnus went for YUK, which Felix challenged, but it was in the dictionary and scored him lots of points on a double-word score. Now Felix had gone to make some coffee, and I\u2019ve been shuffling my tiles hopelessly for about five minutes, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I almost can\u2019t bring myself to go, I\u2019m so humiliated.

Oh, Pig. \u201d As he looks at the board his mouth twitches, and I see Wanda give him a warning frown.</p><p>I can\u2019t bear this any longer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go and check who called, if that\u2019s OK,\u201d I say. \u201cMight be something important.\u201d</p><p>I escape to the kitchen, haul my phone out of the bag, and lean against the comforting warmth of the Aga. There are three texts from Sam, starting with Good luck, which he sent two hours ago. Then twenty minutes ago he texted, Favor to ask, followed up by, Are you there?</p><p>That call was from him too. I guess I\u2019d better see what\u2019s up. I dial his number, picking morosely at the remains of the birthday cake on the counter.</p> <p>\u201cGreat. Poppy. Can you do me a big favor?\u201d he says as soon as we\u2019re connected. \u201cI\u2019m away from my desk and something\u2019s up with my phone. It won\u2019t connect to the server. Nothing\u2019s going out, and I need to get an email to Viv Amberley. Would you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Vivien Amberley,\u201d I begin knowledgeably\u2014then draw myself up short.</p><p>Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t reveal that I\u2019ve read all the correspondence about Vivien Amberley. She works in strategy and has applied for a job at another consultancy. Sam is desperately trying to keep her, but nothing\u2019s worked and now she\u2019s said she\u2019s resigning tomorrow.</p><p>OK. I know I\u2019ve been nosy. But once you start reading other people\u2019s emails, you can\u2019t stop. You have to know what\u2019s happened. It\u2019s been quite addictive, scrolling down the endless strings of back-and-forth emails and working out the stories. Always backward. Like rewinding little spools of life.</p><p>\u201cIf you could send her a quick email, I\u2019d be hugely grateful,\u201d Sam\u2019s saying. \u201cFrom one of my email addresses. To</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>/* */</p><p>, have you got that? I\u2019d do it myself, but I have to be at this media seminar.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. What am I, his PA?</p><p>\u201cWell ... all right,\u201d I say grudgingly, clicking on her address. \u201cWhat shall I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Viv. I would love to talk this through with you again. Please call to arrange a meeting whenever\u2019s convenient tomorrow. I\u2019m sure we can work something out. Sam.\u201d</p><p>I type it out carefully, using my non-bandaged hand\u2014then hesitate.</p><p>\u201cHave you sent it?\u201d Sam says.</p><p>My thumb is on the key, poised to press send. But I can\u2019t do it.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her Viv,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cShe hates it. She likes being called Vivien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam sounds gobsmacked. \u201cHow the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in an old email that got forwarded. She asked Peter Snell not to call her Viv, but he didn\u2019t notice. Nor did Jeremy Atheling. And now you\u2019re calling her Viv too!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d says Sam at last, and I picture those dark eyebrows of his knitted in a frown. \u201cHave you been reading my emails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI\u2019ve just glanced at a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this Viv thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking up the email now... .\u201d I stuff a chunk of icing in my mouth while I\u2019m waiting\u2014then Sam is back on the line. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Can you change the email to Vivien ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute ... \u201d I amend the email and send it. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Good save. That was sharp of you. Are you always this sharp?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. I\u2019m so sharp, the only Scrabble word I can come up with is PIG.</p><p>\u201cYes, all the time,\u201d I say sarcastically, but I don\u2019t think he notices my tone.</p><p>\u201cWell, I owe you one. And I\u2019m sorry for disturbing your evening, but it\u2019s a fairly urgent situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I get it,\u201d I say understandingly. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure Vivien wants to stay at White Globe Consulting, really.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oops.

I\u2019ve asked everyone else\u2019s opinion, why not throw your tuppenceworth in? Why is our top strategist taking a sideways step into an inferior company when I\u2019ve offered her everything she could want, from promotion, to money, to a higher profile\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the problem,\u201d I cut him off, puzzled. Surely he realizes that? \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want any of those things. She gets really stressed out by the pressure, especially by media things.

I think that\u2019s what she means.\u201d</p><p>The fact is, I feel a total affinity for Vivien. I\u2019d be freaked out by being on Radio 4 too.

Maybe she thinks it\u2019s just easier to move jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Sam exhales. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m going to pursue this. I\u2019m very glad I rang you, and I\u2019m sorry I disturbed your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I hunch my shoulders gloomily and scoop up some more cake crumbs. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m glad to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat good, huh?\u201d He sounds amused. \u201cHow did the bandage go down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, the bandage is the least of my problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I lower my voice, glancing at the door. \u201cWe\u2019re playing Scrabble.

They all put words like iridiums.

Try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I have a W. And a Z. \u201d This conversation is so bizarre that I can\u2019t help giving a little giggle.</p><p>\u201cGo and look at the rest. Text them over. I\u2019ll give you a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were at a seminar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be at a seminar and play Scrabble at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Is he serious?

Someone has put down UG. Is that English? It sounds like Eskimo.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Poppy?\u201d says Wanda, in such bright, artificial tones that I instantly know they\u2019ve been talking about me. They\u2019ve probably told Magnus that if he marries me they\u2019ll cut him off without a penny or something.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I try to sound cheerful. \u201cThat was a patient on the phone,\u201d I add, crossing my fingers behind my back. \u201cSometimes I do online consultation, so I might have to send a text, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one even replies.

I can\u2019t remember the title now, but it goes something like ... \u201d</p><p>I hesitate, trying to think what Burns\u2019s poetry sounds like. I heard some once at a Hogmanay party, not that I could understand a word of it.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas whaizled ... when the wully whaizle ... wailed. And so on!\u201d I break off brightly. \u201cI won\u2019t bore you.\u201d</p><p>Antony raises his head from the N\u2013Z volume of the dictionary, which he instantly picked up when I laid my tiles down and has been flicking through.</p><p>\u201cQuite right.\u201d He seems a bit flummoxed. \u201cWhaizled. Scottish dialect for wheezed. Well, well. Very impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBravo, Poppy.\u201d Wanda is totting up. \u201cSo, that\u2019s a triple word score, plus your fifty-point bonus ... so that\u2019s ... one hundred and thirty-one points!

Although Jeeves probably knew a fair bit about Burns\u2019s poetry too.</p><p>5</p> <p>I won! I won the Scrabble game!</p><p>Everyone was gobsmacked. They pretended not to be\u2014but they were. The raised eyebrows and astonished glances became more frequent and less guarded as the game went on. When I got that triple word score with saxatile, Felix actually broke out into applause and said, \u201cBravo!\u201d And as we were tidying the kitchen afterward, Wanda asked me if I\u2019d ever thought of studying linguistics.</p><p>My name was entered in the family Scrabble book, Antony offered me the \u201cwinner\u2019s glass of port,\u201d and everyone clapped. It was such a sweet moment.</p><p>OK. I know it was cheating. I know it was a bad thing to do. To be honest, I kept expecting someone to catch me out. But I put the ring tone on silent and no one realized I was texting Sam all the way through.43</p><p>And, yes, of course I feel guilty. Halfway through, I felt even worse when I texted Sam in admiration:, How do you know all these words?, and he replied, I don\u2019t. The internet does.</p><p>The internet ?</p> <p>For a moment I felt too shocked to reply. I thought he was thinking of the words, not finding them on Scrabblewords.com or whatever.</p><p>That\u2019s CHEATING!!!! I typed.</p><p>You already crossed that line, he texted back. What\u2019s the difference? And then he added, Flattered you thought I was a genius.</p><p>Then, of course, I felt really stupid.</p><p>And he had a point. Once you\u2019ve started cheating, does it matter what your methods are?</p><p>I know I\u2019m storing up problems for the future. I know Sam Roxton won\u2019t always be on the end of my phone to feed me words. I know I couldn\u2019t possibly repeat the feat. Which is why I\u2019m planning to retire from family Scrabble, as of tomorrow. It was a short, brilliant career. And now it\u2019s over.</p><p>The only person who wasn\u2019t entirely fulsome in his praise was Magnus, which was a bit surprising. I mean, he said, \u201cWell done,\u201d along with everyone else\u2014but he didn\u2019t give me a special hug or even ask me how come I knew all those words. And when Wanda said, \u201cMagnus, you didn\u2019t tell us Poppy was so talented!\u201d he flashed her this quick smile and said, \u201cI told you, Poppy\u2019s brilliant at everything.\u201d Which was nice\u2014but kind of meaningless too.</p><p>The thing is ... he came in second.</p> <p>He can\u2019t be jealous of me, surely?</p><p>It\u2019s about eleven now, and we\u2019re back in my flat. I\u2019m half-tempted to go and talk to Magnus about it, but he\u2019s disappeared off to do some preparation for a lecture on Symbols and Symbolic Thought in Dante44 which he\u2019s giving tomorrow. So instead I curl up on the sofa and forward some emails which came in earlier for Sam.</p><p>After a few I can\u2019t help clicking my tongue with frustration. Half of these emails are reminders and chasers. He still hasn\u2019t replied about the conference accommodation at Chiddingford Hotel, or the Fun Run, or the dentist. Or the new James &amp; James bespoke suit waiting for him to pick up at his convenience. How can you ignore new clothes?</p><p>There are only a few people he ever seems to reply to immediately. One is a girl called Vicks, who runs the PR department. She\u2019s very businesslike and curt, just like him, and has been consulting him about some press launch they\u2019re doing together. She often cc\u2019s Violet\u2019s address, but by the time I forward the email, Sam\u2019s already replied to her. Another is a guy called Malcolm, who asks Sam\u2019s opinion about something nearly every hour. And, of course, Sir Nicholas Murray, who\u2019s clearly very senior and important and is doing some work for the government at the moment.45 He and Sam get on incredibly well, if their emails are anything to go by. They zing back and forth like conversation between old friends. I can\u2019t really understand half of what they\u2019re saying\u2014especially all the in-jokes\u2014but the tone is obvious, and so is the fact that Sam has more emails to and from Sir Nicholas than anybody else.</p><p>Sam\u2019s company is evidently some kind of consultancy. They tell companies how to run their businesses and they do a lot of facilitating, whatever that is. I guess they\u2019re like negotiators or mediators or something. They must be pretty successful at it, because Sam seems very popular. He\u2019s been invited to three drinks parties this week alone and to a shooting event with a private bank next weekend. And a girl called Blue has emailed for the third time, asking if he\u2019d like to attend a special reception to celebrate the merger of Johnson Ellison with Greene Retail. It\u2019s at the Savoy, with a jazz band and canap\u00e9s and goody bags. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he still hasn\u2019t replied.

Poppy</p> <p>A moment later my phone rings. It\u2019s Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi\u2014\u201d I start.</p><p>\u201cOK, you\u2019re a genius,\u201d he interrupts. \u201cI had a hunch Vivien would be working late. I called her for a chat and mentioned the issues we discussed. It all came out. You were right. We\u2019re going to talk again tomorrow, but I think she\u2019s staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, pleased. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cNot only cool. Awesome. Incredible. Do you know how much time and money and trouble you have saved me? I owe you, big-time.\u201d He pauses. \u201cOh, and you\u2019re right, she hates being called Viv. So I owe you twice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem! Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... that\u2019s all I had to say. I won\u2019t keep you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night. Glad it all worked out.\u201d As I ring off, I remember something and quickly type a text.</p><p>Have u booked dentist yet? U will get manky teeth!!!</p><p>A few seconds later the phone bleeps with a reply:</p><p>I\u2019ll take my chances.</p> <p>Take his chances? Is he nuts ? My aunt is a dental nurse, so I know what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>I search the Web for the most gross, revolting photo of decaying teeth I can find. They\u2019re all blackened and some have fallen out. I click on send/share and text it to him.</p><p>The phone almost immediately bleeps with a reply:</p><p>You made me spill my drink.</p><p>I giggle and text back:</p><p>Be afraid!!!!</p><p>I nearly add: Willow won\u2019t be impressed when your teeth fall out!!! But then I stop, feeling awkward. You have to draw a line. Despite all the texting back and forth, I don\u2019t know this guy. And I certainly don\u2019t know his fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Although the truth is, I feel as though I do know her. And not in a good way.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never come across anyone or anything like Willow before. She\u2019s unbelievable. I would say she\u2019s sent twenty emails to Sam since I\u2019ve had this phone. Each screwier than the last. At least she\u2019s given up sending messages addressed directly to Violet. But, still, she keeps cc\u2019ing her emails to the PA address, as though she wants to have as much chance of reaching Sam as possible and doesn\u2019t care who sees what.</p><p>Why does she have to email her most private thoughts, anyway? Why can\u2019t they just have these conversations in bed, like normal people?</p><p>This evening she was going on about this dream she\u2019d had about him last night, and how she felt suffocated but ignored all at the same time, and did he realize how toxic he was? Did he realize how he was CORRODING HER SPIRIT????</p><p>I always type a reply to her now; I can\u2019t help it. This time I put: Do you realize how toxic YOU are, Willow the Witch?</p><p>And then deleted it. Naturally.</p><p>The most frustrating thing is that I never get to see Sam\u2019s replies. There\u2019s no back-and-forth correspondence; she always starts a fresh email. Sometimes they\u2019re friendly\u2014like yesterday she sent one that just said, You\u2019re a really, really special man, you know that, Sam? Which was quite sweet. But nine out of ten are whinging. I can\u2019t help feeling sorry for him.</p><p>Anyway. His life. His fianc\u00e9e. Whatever.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart!\u201d Magnus comes into the room, interrupting my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I quickly turn off. \u201cFinished your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me disturb you.\u201d He nods at the phone. \u201cChatting to the girls?\u201d</p><p>I give a noncommittal smile and slip the phone into my pocket.</p><p>I know, I know, I know. This is bad. Keeping a secret from Magnus. Not telling him about the ring or the phone or any of it. But how can I start now? Where would I begin? And maybe I\u2019d regret it. What if I confess all and cause a huge rift and half an hour later the ring turns up and I needn\u2019t have said anything?</p><p>\u201cYou know me!\u201d I say at last, and give a little laugh. \u201cWhat did you talk to your parents about tonight?\u201d I quickly move on to the subject I really want to find out about\u2014i.e., what do his parents think of me and have they changed their mind?</p><p>\u201cOh, my parents.\u201d He makes an impatient gesture and sinks down on the sofa. He\u2019s tapping his fingers on the arm, and his eyes are distant.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d I say cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d He turns to me and the clouds fall away from his eyes. Suddenly he\u2019s focused. \u201cRemember when we first met?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile back. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>He starts stroking my leg. \u201cI arrived at that place expecting the battle-ax. But there you were.\u201d</p><p>I wish he wouldn\u2019t always call Ruby a battle-ax. She\u2019s not. She\u2019s gorgeous and lovely and sexy; her arms are just a teeny bit meaty. But I hide my squirm of irritation and keep smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou were like an angel in that white uniform. I\u2019ve never seen anything more sexy in my life.\u201d His hand is moving farther up my leg with intent. \u201cI wanted you, right there, right then.\u201d</p> <p>Magnus loves telling this story, and I love hearing it.</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted you.\u201d I lean over and gently bite his earlobe. \u201cThe minute I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did. I could tell.\u201d He pulls my top aside and starts to nuzzle my bare shoulder. \u201cHey, Poppy, let\u2019s get back in to that room one day,\u201d he whispers. \u201cThat\u2019s the best sex I\u2019ve ever had. You, in that white uniform, up on that couch, with that massage oil ... Jesus ... \u201d46 He starts tugging at my skirt and we both tumble off the sofa onto the carpet. And as my phone bleeps with another text, I barely notice.</p><p>It\u2019s not until much later on, when we\u2019re getting ready for bed and I\u2019m rubbing in body lotion,47 that Magnus lands his bombshell.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mum called earlier.\u201d His speech is muffled with toothpaste. \u201cAbout the skin guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He spits out and wipes his mouth. \u201cPaul. Our neighbor. He\u2019s coming to the wedding rehearsal to look at your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201c What ?\u201d My hand clenches automatically and I squirt body lotion across the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cMum says you can\u2019t be too careful with burns, and I think she\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have to do that!\u201d I\u2019m trying not to sound panicky.</p><p>\u201cSweets.\u201d He kisses my head. \u201cIt\u2019s all fixed up.\u201d</p> <p>He heads out of the bathroom and I stare at my reflection. My happy postsex glow has gone. I\u2019m back to the black hole of dread. What do I do? I can\u2019t keep dodging forever.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a burned hand. I don\u2019t have an engagement ring. I don\u2019t have an encyclopedic knowledge of Scrabble words. I\u2019m a total phony.</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d Magnus appears meaningfully at the bathroom door. I know he wants to get to sleep because he\u2019s got to go to Brighton early tomorrow. He\u2019s writing a book with a professor there and they keep having disagreements which require emergency meetings.</p><p>\u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>I follow him to bed and curl up in his arms and give a pretty good impersonation of someone falling peacefully off to sleep. But inside I\u2019m churning. Every time I try to switch off, a million thoughts come crowding back in. If I call off Paul the dermatologist, will Wanda be suspicious? Could I mock up a burn on my hand? What if I just told Magnus everything right now?</p><p>I try to picture this last scenario. I know it\u2019s the most sensible. It\u2019s the one the agony aunts would recommend. Wake him up and tell him.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. And not only because Magnus is always totally ratty if he gets woken up in the night. He\u2019d be so shocked. His parents would always think of me as the girl who lost the heirloom ring. It\u2019d define me forevermore. It\u2019d cast a pall over everything.</p><p>And the point is, they don\u2019t have to know. This doesn\u2019t have to come out. Mrs. Fairfax might call anytime. If I can just hold out till then ...</p> <p>I want to get the ring back and quietly slip it on my finger and noone is any the wiser. That\u2019s what I want.</p><p>I glance at the clock\u20142:45 am\u2014then at Magnus, breathing peacefully, and feel a surge of irrational resentment. It\u2019s OK for him.</p><p>Abruptly, I swing my legs out from under the covers and reach for a dressing gown. I\u2019ll go and have a cup of herbal tea, like they recommend in magazine articles on insomnia, along with writing down all your problems on a piece of paper.48</p><p>My phone is charging in the kitchen, and as I\u2019m waiting for the kettle to boil, I idly click through all the messages, methodically forwarding on Sam\u2019s. There\u2019s a text from a new patient of mine who\u2019s just had surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament and is finding it hard going, and I send a quick, reassuring text back, saying I\u2019ll try to fit him in for a session tomorrow.49 I\u2019m pouring hot water on a chamomile and vanilla tea bag when a text bleeps, making me start.</p><p>What are you doing up so late?</p><p>It\u2019s Sam. Who else? I settle down with my tea and take a sip, then text back:</p><p>Can\u2019t sleep. What are YOU doing up so late?</p><p>Waiting to speak to a guy in LA. Why can\u2019t you sleep? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My life ends tomorrow.</p><p>OK, that might be overstating it a tad, but right now that\u2019s how it feels.</p><p>I can see how that might keep you up. Why does it end?</p><p>If he really wants to know, I\u2019ll tell him. Sipping my tea, I fill five texts with the story of how the ring was found but then lost again. And how Paul the dermatologist wants to look at my hand. And how the Tavishes are being snippy enough about the ring already, and they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s lost. And how it\u2019s all closing in on me. And how I feel like a gambler who needs just one more spin on the roulette wheel and everything might come good, but I\u2019m out of chips.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been typing so furiously, my shoulders are aching. I rotate them a few times, take a few gulps of tea, and am wondering about cracking open the biscuits, when a new text arrives.</p><p>I owe you one.</p><p>I read the words and shrug. OK. He owes me. So what? A moment later a second text arrives.</p><p>I could get you a chip.</p><p>I stare at the screen, baffled. He does know the chip thing is a metaphor, doesn\u2019t he? He\u2019s not talking about a real poker chip?</p> <p>Or a french fry?</p><p>The usual daytime traffic hum is absent, making the room abnormally silent, save for an occasional judder from the fridge. I blink at the screen in the artificial light, then rub my tired eyes, wondering if I should turn off the phone and go to bed.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>His reply comes back almost immediately, as though he realized his last text sounded odd.</p><p>Have jeweler friend. Makes replicas for TV. Very realistic. Would buy you time.</p><p>A fake ring?</p> <p>I think I must be really, really thick. Because that had never even occurred to me.</p><p>43 Haven\u2019t both Antony and Wanda ever invigilated exams as part of their jobs? Just saying.</p><p>44 The first time Magnus told me his specialism was symbols, I thought he meant cymbals. The ones you clash. Not that I\u2019ve ever admitted that to him.</p><p>45 Not that I\u2019ve been prying or anything. But you can\u2019t help glancing at things as you forward them and noticing references to the PM and Number 10.</p><p>46 OK. Busted. I didn\u2019t tell the absolute full truth in my disciplinary hearing.</p><p>Here\u2019s the thing: I know I was totally unprofessional. I know I should be struck off. The physiotherapy ethics booklet practically starts, Don\u2019t have sex with your patient on the couch, whatever you do.</p><p>But what I say is: If you do something wrong yet it doesn\u2019t actually hurt anybody and nobody knows, should you be punished and lose your whole career? Isn\u2019t there a bigger picture?</p><p>Plus, we did it only once. And it was really quick. (Not in a bad way. Just in a quick way.)</p> <p>And Ruby once used the offices for a party and propped all the fire doors back, which is totally against health and safety. So. Nobody\u2019s perfect.</p><p>47 This is part of my prewedding regimem, which consists of daily exfoliation, daily lotion, weekly face mask, hair mask, eye mask, a hundred sit-ups every day, and meditation to keep calm. I\u2019ve got as far as the body lotion. And tonight I\u2019m rather hampered by my bandaged hand.</p><p>48 What, for your boyfriend to find?</p><p>49 I don\u2019t give my number out to all my patients. Just long-term patients, emergencies, and the ones who look like they need support. This guy is one of those types who says he\u2019s absolutely fine and then you see he\u2019s white with pain. I had to insist he should call me whenever he wanted and repeat it to his wife, otherwise he would have nobly struggled on.</p><p>6</p><p>OK. A fake ring is a bad idea. There are a million reasons why. Such as:</p><p>1. It\u2019s dishonest.</p><p>2. It probably won\u2019t look convincing.</p><p>3. It\u2019s unethical.50</p><p>Nevertheless, here I am at Hatton Garden at ten the following morning, sauntering along, trying to hide the fact that my eyes are on stalks. I\u2019ve never been to Hatton Garden before; I didn\u2019t even know it existed. A whole street of jewelers?</p><p>There are more diamonds here than I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. Signs everywhere are boasting best prices, highest carats, superb value, and bespoke design. Obviously this is engagement ring city. Couples are wandering along and girls are pointing through the windows and the men are smiling but all look slightly sick whenever their girlfriends turn away.</p><p>I\u2019ve never even been into a jewelry shop. Not a grown-up, proper one like these. The only jewelry I\u2019ve ever had has come from markets and Topshop, places like that. My parents gave me a pair of pearl studs for my thirteenth birthday, but I didn\u2019t go into the shop with them. Jewelry shops have been places I\u2019ve walked past, thinking they\u2019re for other people. But now, since I\u2019m here, I can\u2019t help having a good old look.</p><p>Who would buy a brooch made out of yellow diamonds in the shape of a spider for \u00a312,500? It\u2019s a mystery to me, like who buys those revolting sofas with swirly arms they advertise on the telly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam\u2019s friend\u2019s shop is called Mark Spencer Designs and thankfully doesn\u2019t have any yellow spiders. Instead, it has lots of diamonds set in platinum bands and a sign saying Free champagne for engaged couples. Make your ring-choosing experience a special one. There\u2019s nothing about replicas or fakes, and I start to feel nervous. What if Sam misunderstood? What if I end up buying a real emerald ring out of embarrassment and have to spend the rest of my life paying it off?</p><p>And where is Sam, anyway? He promised to pop along and introduce me to his friend. Apparently he works just round the corner\u2014though he didn\u2019t reveal exactly where. I turn and survey the street. It\u2019s kind of weird that we\u2019ve never met properly, face-to-face.</p><p>There\u2019s a man with dark hair walking briskly on the other side of the road, and for a brief moment I think perhaps that\u2019s him, but then a deep voice says, \u201cPoppy?\u201d</p><p>I turn\u2014and, of course, that\u2019s him: the guy with the dark rumpled hair striding toward me. He\u2019s taller than I remember from my glimpse of him in the hotel lobby but has the same distinctive thick eyebrows and deep-set eyes. He\u2019s wearing a dark suit and immaculate white shirt and a charcoal tie. He flashes me a brief smile, and I notice that his teeth are very white and even.</p> <p>Well. They won\u2019t be for much longer if he doesn\u2019t go to the dentist.</p><p>\u201cHi. Poppy.\u201d As he approaches he hesitates, then extends a hand. \u201cGood to meet you properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smile awkwardly back and we shake hands. He has a nice handshake. Warm and positive.</p><p>\u201cSo, Vivien\u2019s definitely staying with us.\u201d He tilts his head. \u201cThanks again for your insight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d I shrug. \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>This is odd, talking face-to-face. I\u2019m distracted by seeing the contours of his brow and his hair rippling in the breeze. It was easier by text. I wonder if he feels the same way.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d He gestures at the jewelry shop. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>This shop is seriously cool and expensive. I wonder if he and Willow came and chose their ring here. They must have. I\u2019m almost tempted to ask him\u2014but somehow I can\u2019t quite bring myself to mention her. It\u2019s too embarrassing. I know far too much about them.</p><p>Most couples, you meet at the pub or at their house. You talk about anodyne stuff\u2014Holidays, hobbies, Jamie Oliver recipes. Only gradually do you venture on to personal stuff. But with these two, I feel as if I\u2019ve been pitched straight into some fly-on-the-wall documentary and they don\u2019t even know it. I found an old email last night from Willow which just said, Do you know how much PAIN you have caused me, Sam? Quite apart from all the fucking BRAZILIANS??</p><p>Which is something I really wish I hadn\u2019t read. If I ever meet her, that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m going to be able to think about. Brazilians.</p> <p>Sam has pressed the buzzer and is ushering me into the smart, dimly lit shop. At once a girl in a dove-gray suit comes up.</p><p>\u201cHello, may I help?\u201d She has a soft, honeylike voice, which completely suits the muted d\u00e9cor of the shop.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to see Mark,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIt\u2019s Sam Roxton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Another girl in dove-gray nods. \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you. Take them through, Martha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I get you a glass of champagne?\u201d says Martha, giving me a knowing smile as we walk along. \u201cSir? Champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d says Sam.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I chime in.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d She twinkles at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moment for the two of you. Just a little glass to take off the nerves?\u201d</p> <p>Oh my God! She thinks we\u2019re an engaged couple. I glance at Sam for help\u2014but he\u2019s typing something on his phone. And there\u2019s no way I\u2019m launching into the story of losing my priceless heirloom ring in front of a bunch of strangers and hearing all the gasps of horror.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, honestly.\u201d I smile awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014I mean, we\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful watch, sir!\u201d Martha\u2019s attention has been distracted. \u201cIs that vintage Cartier? I haven\u2019t seen one quite like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Sam nods. \u201cGot it at auction in Paris.\u201d</p><p>Now that I notice it, Sam\u2019s watch is quite amazing. It\u2019s got an old leather strap, and the dull gold dial has the patina of another age. And he got it in Paris. That\u2019s pretty cool.</p><p>\u201cGoodness.\u201d As we walk, Martha takes my arm and leans in, lowering her voice, girl-to-girl. \u201cHe has exquisite taste. Lucky you! You can\u2019t say the same of all the men who come in here. Some of them go for absolute horrors. But a man who buys himself vintage Cartier has got to be on the right track!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is painful.

Did he have to say it out loud like that, for anyone to hear?</p><p>\u201cVery temporarily.\u201d I keep my voice almost to a whisper. \u201cJust while I find the real thing. Which I will, really, really soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d He nods. \u201cUseful to have a replica anyway. We do a lot of replacements for travel and so forth. Normally we only make replicas of jewelry we\u2019ve designed ourselves, but we can make the odd exception for friends.\u201d Mark winks at Sam. \u201cAlthough we do try to be a little discreet about it.

A photo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I haul out a photo which I printed off my computer this morning. It\u2019s of Magnus and me at the restaurant where he proposed. We got the couple at the next table to take a picture of us, and I\u2019m holding up my left hand proudly, with the ring clearly visible. I look absolutely giddy\u2014which, to be fair, is how I was feeling.</p><p>Both men stare at it in silence.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s the guy you\u2019re marrying,\u201d says Sam at last. \u201cThe Scrabble fiend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s something in his tone which makes me feel defensive. I have no idea why.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Magnus,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he the academic?\u201d Sam\u2019s frowning at the photo. \u201cHad the TV series?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I feel a flash of pride. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a four-carat emerald, I\u2019d guess?\u201d Mark Spencer looks up from squinting at the photo.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how many carats your engagement ring is?\u201d</p><p>Both men shoot me an odd look.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I feel myself flush. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d lose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet,\u201d says Mark with a wry little smile. \u201cMost girls have it down to the nearest decimal. Then they round up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well.\u201d I shrug to cover my embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s a family ring. We didn\u2019t really talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a lot of mounts in stock. Let me look... .\u201d Mark pushes his chair away and starts searching through the metal drawers.</p><p>\u201cHe still doesn\u2019t know you\u2019ve lost it?\u201d Sam jerks a thumb at the picture of Magnus.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll turn up and ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never have to know you lost it,\u201d Sam finishes for me. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep the secret safe till your deathbed.\u201d</p><p>I look away, feeling twingey with guilt. I don\u2019t like this. I don\u2019t like having secrets from Magnus. I don\u2019t like being the kind of person who has assignations behind her fianc\u00e9\u2019s back. But there\u2019s no other way.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m still getting Violet\u2019s emails on this.\u201d I gesture at him with the phone, to distract myself. \u201cI thought the tech people were sorting it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got some new ones. You\u2019ve been asked about the Fun Run four times now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He barely nods.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to answer? And what about your hotel room for this conference in Hampshire? Do you need it for one night or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see. Not sure yet.\u201d Sam seems so unmoved, I feel a stab of frustration.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you answer your emails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prioritize.\u201d He calmly taps at his screen.</p><p>\u201cOoh, it\u2019s Lindsay Cooper\u2019s birthday!\u201d Now I\u2019m reading a round-robin email. \u201cLindsay in marketing. Do you want to say happy birthday to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not.\u201d He sounds so adamant, I feel a bit affronted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with saying happy birthday to a colleague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do!

Giving up on Lindsay\u2019s birthday, I scroll down to the next email.</p><p>\u201cPeter has finalized the Air France deal. He wants to give you his full report on Monday straight after the team meeting. Is that OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Sam barely glances up. \u201cJust forward it. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>If I forward it, he\u2019ll let it sit there all day without answering.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I reply?\u201d I offer. \u201cSince you\u2019re here and I\u2019ve got the email open? It\u2019ll only take a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He seems surprised. \u201cThanks. Just say, Yes. \u201d</p><p>Yes. I carefully type. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut Sam. \u201d</p><p>I stare at the screen, dissatisfied. Yes. Sam. It looks so bare. So curt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about adding something like, Well done ?\u201d I suggest. \u201cOr You did it! Yay! Or just Best wishes and thanks for everything &gt;\u201d</p><p>Sam looks unimpressed. \u201c Yes, Sam will be plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical,\u201d I mutter under my breath. Except perhaps it wasn\u2019t quite as submerged under my breath as I\u2019d intended, because Sam looks up.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>I know I should bite my tongue. But I\u2019m so frustrated I can\u2019t stop myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so abrupt! Your emails are so short! They\u2019re awful!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. Sam looks as astonished as if the chair had started to speak.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I add giving an awkward shrug. \u201cBut it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Sam at last. \u201cLet\u2019s just get things straight. In the first place, borrowing this phone does not give you a license to read and critique my emails.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cIn the second place, short is good.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already regretting having spoken. But I can\u2019t back down now.</p><p>\u201cNot that short,\u201d I retort. \u201cAnd you ignore most people completely! It\u2019s rude!\u201d</p><p>There. Said it.</p><p>Sam is glowering at me. \u201cLike I said, I prioritize. Now, since your ring situation is sorted, maybe you\u2019d like to hand the phone back and my emails won\u2019t have to bother you anymore.\u201d He holds out his hand.</p><p>Oh God. Is that why he\u2019s helping me? So I\u2019ll give the phone back?</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I clutch the phone. \u201cI mean ... please. I still need it. The hotel might phone me any minute; Mrs. Fairfax will have this number ... \u201d</p><p>I know it\u2019s irrational, but I feel like the moment I give this phone up, I\u2019m saying goodbye to any chance of finding the ring.</p><p>I put it behind my back for good measure and gaze beseechingly at him.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Sam exhales. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I\u2019m interviewing for a new PA this afternoon. That\u2019s a company phone. You can\u2019t just keep it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t! But can I have it a few more days? I won\u2019t critique your emails anymore,\u201d I add tamely. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, guys!\u201d Mark interrupts us. \u201cGood news. I\u2019ve found a mount. Now I\u2019ll select some stones for you to look at. Excuse me a moment... .\u201d</p><p>As he heads out of the room, my phone bleeps with a new text.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Willow,\u201d I say, glancing down. \u201cLook.\u201d I gesture at my hands. \u201cForwarding. Not passing any comment. None at all.\u201d51</p><p>\u201cHrrmm.\u201d Sam gives the same noncommittal growl he gave before when I mentioned Willow.</p><p>There\u2019s an odd little pause. What should happen now is I ask something polite like, \u201cSo, how did you two meet?\u201d and \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d and we start a conversation about wedding lists and the price of caterers. But for some reason I can\u2019t bring myself to. Their relationship is so peculiar, I don\u2019t want to go there.</p><p>I know he can be growly and curt, but I still can\u2019t see him with a self-obsessed, whingy bitch like Willow. Especially now I\u2019ve met him in the flesh. She must be really, really, really attractive, I decide. Like, supermodel standard. Her dazzling looks have blinded him to everything else about her. It\u2019s the only explanation.</p><p>\u201cLoads of people are replying to the email about Lindsay\u2019s birthday,\u201d I observe, to fill the silence. \u201c They obviously don\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRound-robin emails are the work of the devil.\u201d Sam barely misses a beat. \u201cI\u2019d rather shoot myself than reply to one.\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s a nice attitude.</p><p>This Lindsay is obviously popular. Every twenty seconds some fresh reply all message arrives on the screen, like, Happy birthday, Lindsay! Have a wonderful celebration, whatever you\u2019re doing. The phone keeps buzzing and flashing. It\u2019s like a party in here. And only Sam is refusing to join in.</p><p>Oh, I can\u2019t stand it. How hard is it to type happy birthday ? Why wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s two words.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t I write happy birthday from you?\u201d I beg. \u201cGo on. You don\u2019t have to do anything. I\u2019ll type it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck\u2019s sake !\u201d Sam looks up from his own phone. \u201cOK. Whatever. Say happy birthday. But no smiley faces or kisses,\u201d he adds warningly. \u201cJust happy birthday. Sam. \u201d</p><p>Happy birthday, Lindsay! I type defiantly. Hope you\u2019re having a great time today. Well done again on that website strategy, it was awesome. Best wishes, Sam.</p><p>Hurriedly, I send it, before he can wonder why I\u2019m typing so much.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the dentist?\u201d I decide to push my luck.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the dentist?\u201d he echoes, and I feel an almighty surge of exasperation. Is he pretending he doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about or has he genuinely forgotten?</p><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d The door opens and Mark appears, holding out a dark-blue velvet tray. \u201cThese are our simulated emeralds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe, my attention torn away from the phone.</p><p>In front of me are ten rows of gleaming emeralds. I mean, I know they\u2019re not real, but quite frankly I couldn\u2019t tell the difference.52</p><p>\u201cIs there any stone which strikes you as having a resemblance to the one you\u2019ve lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one.\u201d I point to an oval rock in the middle. \u201cIt\u2019s almost exactly the same. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He picks it up with a pair of tweezers and places it on a small plastic dish. \u201cThe diamonds are obviously smaller and less noticeable, so I\u2019m fairly confident of a match. You want a little distressing?\u201d he adds. \u201cTake the shine off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do that?\u201d I say in amazement.</p><p>\u201cWe can do anything,\u201d he says confidently. \u201cWe once made the Crown Jewels for a Hollywood movie. Looked absolutely genuine, although they never even used them in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Well ... yes, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. We should get this knocked out in\u201d\u2014he glances at his watch\u2014\u201cthree hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>As I stand up, I\u2019m astounded. I can\u2019t believe this was so easy. In fact, I feel quite exhilarated with relief. This will see me through a couple of days and then I\u2019ll get the real thing back and it\u2019ll all be OK.</p><p>When we return to the showroom, I sense a rustle of interest. Martha\u2019s head pops up from the book she was writing in, and a couple of girls in dove gray are whispering and nodding at me from their position by the door. Mark leads us over to Martha again, who beams at me even more widely than before.</p> <p>\u201cLook after these lovely people for me, Martha, will you?\u201d he says, giving her a folded piece of paper. \u201cHere are the details. Bye, again.\u201d</p><p>He and Sam shake hands warmly, then Mark disappears off to the rear of the shop.</p><p>\u201cYou look happy!\u201d Martha says to me with a twinkle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d I can\u2019t contain my delight. \u201cMark\u2019s brilliant. I just can\u2019t believe what he can do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is rather special. Oh, I\u2019m so pleased for you.\u201d She squeezes my arm. \u201cWhat a wonderful day for you both!\u201d</p><p>Oh ... shit. Suddenly I realize what she means. I glance sharply at Sam, but he\u2019s stepped aside to read something on his phone and is oblivious.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re all dying to know.\u201d Martha\u2019s eyes are twinkling. \u201cWhat are you getting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... \u201d</p><p>This conversation has definitely lurched in the wrong direction. But I can\u2019t think how to steer it back.</p><p>\u201cMartha told us about the vintage Cartier watch!\u201d Another girl in dove gray joins the conversation, and I can see two other girls edging forward to listen.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been guessing out here.\u201d Martha nods. \u201cI think Mark will have made you something really special and bespoke. With some wonderful, romantic touch.\u201d She clasps her hands. \u201cMaybe a flawless diamond\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose princess-cut ones are exquisite,\u201d a girl in dove gray gushes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr an antique,\u201d chimes in another girl eagerly. \u201cMark has some amazing old diamonds with stories attached to them. There\u2019s an incredible pale-pink one; did he show you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cUm ... you don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh God. What can I say? I\u2019m not getting into the whole story.</p><p>\u201cWe love a beautiful ring.\u201d Martha sighs happily. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what it is, really, as long as it\u2019s magical for you. Oh, come on.\u201d She gives an impish smile. \u201cI have to know.\u201d She opens the paper with a beaming flourish. \u201cAnd the answer is ... \u201d</p> <p>As she reads the words on the page, Martha\u2019s voice cuts off in a sort of gasp. For a moment she seems unable to speak. \u201cOh! A simulated emerald,\u201d she manages at last, sounding strangled. \u201cLovely. And simulated diamonds too. So pretty.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I can say. I\u2019m aware of four crestfallen faces gazing at me. Martha looks most devastated of all.</p><p>\u201cWe thought it was a lovely ring,\u201d I offer lamely.</p><p>\u201cIt is! It is!\u201d Martha is obviously forcing herself to nod animatedly. \u201cWell ... congratulations! So sensible of you to go for simulations.\u201d She exchanges looks with the other girls in dove gray, who all hastily chime in.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery sensible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely choice!\u201d</p><p>The bright voices so don\u2019t match the faces. One girl almost looks like she wants to cry.</p><p>Martha seems slightly fixated by Sam\u2019s vintage gold Cartier. I can practically read her mind: He can afford vintage Cartier for himself and he bought his girlfriend a FAKE?</p><p>\u201cCan I just see the price?\u201d Sam has finished tapping at his phone and takes the paper from Martha. As he reads it, he frowns. \u201cFour hundred and fifty pounds\u2014that\u2019s a lot. I thought Mark promised a discount.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d53 I nod, a bit mortified.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019s it so expensive?\u201d He turns to Martha, and her eyes flick yet again to his Cartier watch before she addresses him with a professional smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the platinum, sir. It\u2019s a precious, timeless material. Most of our customers value a material that will last a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can we have something cheaper? Silver plate?\u201d Sam turns to me. \u201cYou agree, don\u2019t you, Poppy? As cheap as possible?\u201d</p><p>I hear a couple of stifled gasps across the shop. I catch a glimpse of Martha\u2019s horrified face and can\u2019t help flushing.</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course,\u201d I mutter. \u201cWhatever\u2019s cheapest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just check with Mark,\u201d says Martha after rather a long pause. She moves away and makes a brief phone call. As she returns to the register, she\u2019s blinking fast and can\u2019t look me in the eye. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Mark and the ring can be made in silver-plated nickel, which brings the price down to\u201d\u2014she taps again\u2014\u201cone hundred and twelve pounds. Would you prefer that option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course we would.\u201d Sam glances at me. \u201cNo-brainer, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Of course.\u201d Martha\u2019s bright smile has frozen solid. \u201cThat\u2019s ... fine. Silver-plated nickel it is. \u2019 She seems to gather control of herself. \u201cIn terms of presentation, sir, we offer a deluxe leather ring box at thirty pounds, or a simpler wooden box for ten pounds. Each option will be lined with rose petals and can have a personalization. Perhaps initials or a little message?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA message ?\u201d Sam gives an incredulous laugh. \u201cNo, thanks. And no packaging. We\u2019ll have it as is. D\u2019you want a carrier bag or something, Poppy?\u201d He glances at me.</p><p>Martha is breathing harder and harder. For a moment I think she might lose it.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d she says at last. \u201cAbsolutely fine. No box, no rose petals, no message.... \u201d She taps at her computer. \u201cAnd how will you be paying for the ring, sir?\u201d She\u2019s obviously mustering all her energies to stay pleasant.</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d Sam nods at me expectantly.</p><p>As I pull out my purse, Martha\u2019s expression is so aghast, I nearly expire with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSo ... you\u2019ll be paying for the ring, madam.\u201d She can barely get the words out. \u201cWonderful! That\u2019s ... wonderful. No problem at all.\u201d</p><p>I tap in my PIN and take the receipt. Yet more girls in dove gray have appeared in the showroom, and they\u2019re standing in clusters, whispering and staring at me. My entire body is drenched in mortification. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam, of course, has noticed nothing.</p><p>\u201cWill we see you both later?\u201d Martha clearly makes a supreme effort to recover herself as she ushers us to the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll have champagne waiting and we\u2019ll take a photo for your album, of course.\u201d A tiny glow comes back into her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s such a special moment when you first take the ring and slide it onto her finger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve spent far too long here already,\u201d says Sam, absently glancing at his watch. \u201cCan\u2019t you just bike it round to Poppy?\u201d</p><p>This seems to be the last straw for Martha.

As I glance back toward the shop, I can see Martha talking animatedly to the other girls in dove gray and gesticulating out the window toward Sam, a look of outrage on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sam frowns. \u201cShe didn\u2019t try to sell you the expensive ring, did she? Because I\u2019ll have a word with Mark\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! Nothing like that.\u201d I hesitate, almost too embarrassed to tell him.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Sam peers at me.</p><p>\u201cShe thought you were my fianc\u00e9 and you were making me buy my own engagement ring,\u201d I admit at last. \u201cShe told me not to marry you. She was very worried for me.\u201d</p><p>I won\u2019t go into Martha\u2019s theory about generosity in the jewelry shop and generosity in bed and how they relate.54</p><p>I can see the light slowly dawning on Sam\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s funny.\u201d He bursts into laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s very funny. Hey.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to pay for it, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not!\u201d I say, shocked. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! I just feel terrible that the whole shop thinks you\u2019re a cheapskate, when you were actually doing me a massive favor. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d I wince.</p><p>Sam looks baffled. \u201cWhat does that matter? I don\u2019t care what they think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must care a bit. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one bit.\u201d</p><p>I peer at him closely. His face is calm. I think he means it. He doesn\u2019t care. How can you not care?</p><p>Magnus would care. He always flirts with shop assistants and tries to work out if they recognize him from TV. And one time, when his card was declined in our local supermarket, he made a point of going back in there the next day and telling them about how his bank completely cocked up the day before.</p><p>Oh well. Now I don\u2019t feel quite so bad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to grab a Starbucks.\u201d Sam starts heading off down the street. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them.\u201d I hurry after him. \u201cI owe you one. Big-time.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to be back at the clinic till after lunch, because I got Annalise to swap her morning off with mine. For a hefty bribe.</p><p>\u201cYou remember I mentioned a man called Sir Nicholas Murray,\u201d Sam says as he swings the coffee shop door open. \u201cHe\u2019s sending over a document. I\u2019ve told him to use my own email address, but if by any chance he sends it your way by mistake, please let me know at once. \u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. He\u2019s quite famous, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I can\u2019t resist adding. \u201cWasn\u2019t he number eighteen in the world\u2019s movers and shakers in 1985?\u201d</p><p>I did some Googling last night, and I\u2019m totally on top of the whole subject of Sam\u2019s company. I know everything. I could go on Mastermind. I could do a PowerPoint presentation. In fact, I wish someone would ask me to do one! Facts I know about White Globe Consulting, in no particular order:</p><p>1. It was started in 1982 by Nicholas Murray and now it\u2019s been bought out by some big multinational group.</p><p>2. Sir Nicholas is still the CEO. Apparently he can smooth a meeting\u2019s atmosphere by just arriving and can stop a deal in its tracks with a single shake of the head. He always wears floral shirts. It\u2019s his thing.</p><p>3. The finance director was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Sir Nicholas, but he\u2019s recently left the company. His name is Ed Exton.55</p><p>4. Ed and Sir Nicholas\u2019s friendship has disintegrated over the years, and Ed didn\u2019t even attend the party when Sir Nicholas was knighted.56 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5. They had this scandal recently when a guy called John Gregson made a politically incorrect joke at a lunch and had to resign.57 Some people thought it was unfair, but the new chairman of the board apparently has \u201czero tolerance for inappropriate behaviour.\u201d58</p><p>6. Sir Nicholas is currently advising the prime minister on a new special \u201chappiness and well-being\u2019 committee, which all the newspapers have been rude about. One even described Sir Nicholas as past his prime and had a cartoon of him as a flower with straggly petals. (I won\u2019t mention that to Sam.)</p><p>7. They won an award for their paper recycling program last year.</p><p>\u201cWell done on the recycling, by the way,\u201d I add, eager to display my knowledge. \u201cI saw your statement that environmental responsibility is a fundamental linchpin for any company that aspires to excellence. So true. We recycle too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam seems taken aback, even suspicious. \u201cHow did you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoogle search. It\u2019s not against the law!\u201d I add, at his expression. \u201cI was interested. Since I\u2019m sending on emails all the time, I thought I\u2019d find out a bit about your company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you did, did you?\u201d Sam shoots me a dubious look. \u201cDouble tall cappuccino, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Sir Nicholas is advising the prime minister! That\u2019s really cool!\u201d</p><p>This time, Sam doesn\u2019t even answer. Honestly. He\u2019s not exactly a great ambassador.</p> <p>\u201cHave you been to Number Ten?\u201d I persist. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re waiting for your coffee order.\u201d Sam gestures at the barista.</p><p>Obviously he\u2019s going to give away absolutely nothing. Typical. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be pleased that I\u2019m interested in what he does.</p><p>\u201cSkinny latte for me.\u201d I haul out my purse. \u201cAnd a chocolate chip muffin. You want a muffin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Sam shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best.\u201d I nod wisely. \u201cSince you refuse to go to the dentist.\u201d</p> <p>Sam gives me a blank look, which could mean, \u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u2019 or \u201cI\u2019m not listening,\u2019 or, again, \u201cWhat do you mean, the dentist?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m beginning to learn how he works. It\u2019s like he has an on switch and an off switch. And he only flips the on switch when he can be bothered.</p><p>I click on my browser, search for another revolting picture of manky teeth, and forward it to him silently.</p><p>\u201cThis Savoy reception, by the way,\u201d I say as we go to pick up our drinks. \u201cYou need to send your acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to that,\u201d he says, as though it\u2019s obvious.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cI have no particular reason to.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a heavy week for social events.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t believe this. How can he not want to go to the Savoy? God, it\u2019s all right for top businessmen, isn\u2019t it? Free champagne, yawn, yawn. Goody bags, yet another party, yawn, how tedious and dull.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you should let them know, then.\u201d I barely hide my disapproval. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll do it right now. Dear Blue, Thanks so much for the invitation, \u201d I read aloud as I type. \u201c Unfortunately, Sam will be unable to attend on this occasion. Best wishes, Poppy Wyatt. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Sam is staring at me, bemused. \u201cOne of the PAs at the office is helping me out now. Girl called Jane Ellis. She can do that.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but will she do it? I want to retort. I\u2019m aware of this Jane Ellis, who has started making an occasional appearance in Sam\u2019s in-box. But her real job is working for Sam\u2019s colleague Malcolm. I\u2019m sure the last thing she wants to be doing is wrangling Sam\u2019s schedule on top of her usual workload.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d I shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s been really bugging me.\u201d Our coffees have arrived on the counter and I hand him his. \u201cSo ... thanks again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble.\u201d He holds the door open for me. \u201cHope you find the ring. As soon as you\u2019ve finished with the phone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cI\u2019ll bike it round. The same nanosecond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He allows me a half smile. \u201cWell, I hope everything goes well for you.\u201d He extends a hand and I shake it politely.</p><p>\u201cHope everything goes well for you too.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t even asked him when his wedding is. Perhaps it\u2019s a week from tomorrow, like ours. In the same church, even. I\u2019ll arrive and see him on the steps with Willow the Witch on his arm, telling him he\u2019s toxic.</p><p>He strides away and I hurry off toward the bus stop. There\u2019s a 45 bus disgorging passengers, and I climb on board. It\u2019ll take me to Streatham Hill, and I can walk from there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I take my seat, I look out and see Sam walking swiftly along the pavement, his face impassive, almost stony. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the wind or he\u2019s been knocked by a passerby, but somehow his tie has gone skew-whiff, and he doesn\u2019t even seem to have noticed. Now that\u2019s bugging me. I can\u2019t resist sending him a text.</p><p>Your tie\u2019s crooked.</p><p>I wait about thirty seconds, then watch his face jolt in surprise. As he\u2019s looking around, searching the pedestrians on the pavement, I text again:</p><p>On the bus.</p> <p>The bus has moved off by now, but the traffic\u2019s heavy and I\u2019m pretty much keeping pace with Sam. He looks up, straightening his tie, and flashes me a smile.</p><p>I\u2019ll have to admit, he does have quite a smile. Kind of heart-stopping, especially as it comes out of nowhere.</p><p>I mean ... you know. If your heart was in the kind of place to be stopped.</p><p>Anyway. An email has just come in from Lindsay Cooper, and I briskly open it.</p><p>Dear Sam,</p> <p>Thank you so much! Your words mean a lot to me\u2014it\u2019s so nice to know you are appreciated!! I\u2019ve told the whole team who helped me with the strategy document, and it\u2019s really boosted morale!</p><p>Best,</p><p>Lindsay</p><p>It\u2019s cc\u2019ed to his other address too, so he\u2019ll have got it on his phone. A moment later my phone bleeps with a text from Sam.</p><p>What did you write to Lindsay??</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling as I type back:</p> <p>Happy birthday. Just like you said.</p><p>What else??</p><p>I don\u2019t see why I need to answer. Two can play at selective deafness.</p><p>Have you contacted the dentist yet? I counter.</p><p>I wait a while\u2014but we\u2019re back to radio silence. Another email has arrived in the phone, this time from one of Lindsay\u2019s colleagues, and as I read it I can\u2019t help feeling vindicated.</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>Lindsay passed on your kind words about the website strategy. We were so honored and delighted you took the time to comment. Thanks, and look forward to chatting about more initiatives, maybe at the next monthly meeting.</p><p>Adrian (Foster)</p> <p>Ha. You see? You see?</p><p>It\u2019s all very well sending off two-word emails. It might be efficient. It might get the job done. But no one likes you. Now that whole website team will feel happy and wanted and work brilliantly. And it\u2019s all because of me! Sam should have me doing his emails all the time.</p><p>On a sudden impulse, I scroll down to Rachel\u2019s zillionth email about the Fun Run and press Reply.</p><p>Hi, Rachel.</p><p>Count me in for the Fun Run. It\u2019s a great endeavor and I look forward to supporting it. Well done!</p><p>Sam</p><p>He looks fit. He can do a Fun Run, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>On a roll now, I scroll down to that guy in IT who\u2019s been politely asking about sending Sam his CV and ideas for the company. I mean, surely Sam should be encouraging people who want to get ahead?</p><p>Dear James,</p><p>I would be very glad to see your CV and hear about your ideas. Please make an appointment with Jane Ellis, and well done for being so proactive!</p><p>Sam</p><p>And now that I\u2019ve started, I can\u2019t stop. As the bus chugs along, I email the guy wanting to assess Sam\u2019s workstation for health and safety, set up a time, then email Jane to tell her to put it in the schedule.59 I email Sarah, who has been off with shingles, and ask her if she\u2019s better.</p><p>All those unanswered emails that have been nagging away at me. All those poor ignored people trying to get in touch with Sam. Why shouldn\u2019t I answer them? I\u2019m doing him such a service! I feel like I\u2019m repaying him for his favor with the ring. At least, when I hand this phone back, his in-box will have been dealt with.</p><p>In fact, what about a round-robin email telling everyone they\u2019re fab? Why not? Who can it hurt?</p><p>Dear Staff,</p><p>I just wanted to say that you\u2019ve all done a great job so far this year.</p><p>As I\u2019m typing, an even better thought comes to me.</p><p>As you know, I value all your views and ideas. We are lucky to have such talent at White Globe Consulting and want to make the most of it. If you have any ideas for the company you would like to share, please send them to me. Be honest!</p><p>All best wishes and here\u2019s to a great year ahead.</p><p>Sam</p><p>I press send with satisfaction. There. Talk about motivational. Talk about team spirit! As I sit back, my fingers are aching from so much typing. I take a sip of latte, reach for my muffin, stuff a massive chunk into my mouth\u2014and my phone starts ringing.</p><p>Shit. Of all the times.</p><p>I press talk, lift the receiver to my ear, and try to say \u201cJust a moment,\u201d but it comes out as \u201cGobblllllg.\u201d My whole mouth is full of claggy muffin. What do they put in these things?</p><p>\u201cIs that you?\u201d A youthful, reedy male voice is speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s Scottie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Scottie? Scottie?</p><p>Something sparks in my mind. Scottie. Wasn\u2019t that the name mentioned by Violet\u2019s friend who rang before? The one who was talking about liposuction?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done. Like I said. It was a surgical strike. No trace. Genius stuff, if I say so myself. Adi\u00f3s, Santa Claus.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m chewing my muffin as frantically as I can, but I still can\u2019t utter a sound.</p> <p>\u201cAre you there? Is this the right\u2014Oh, fucking\u2014 \u201d The voice disappears as I manage to swallow.</p><p>\u201cHello? Can I take a message?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s gone. I check the caller ID, but it\u2019s Unknown Number.</p><p>You\u2019d think all Violet\u2019s friends would know her new number by now. Clicking my tongue, I reach inside my bag for the Lion King program, which is still there.</p><p>Scottie rang, I scribble next to the first message. It\u2019s done. Surgical strike. No trace. Genius stuff. Adi\u00f3s, Santa Claus.</p> <p>If I ever meet this Violet, I hope she\u2019s grateful for all my efforts. In fact, I hope I do meet her. I haven\u2019t been taking all these messages for nothing.</p><p>I\u2019m about to put the phone away when a crowd of new emails arrives in a flashing bunch. Replies to my round robin already? I scroll down\u2014and to my disappointment, most of them are standard company messages or ads. But the second-to-last makes me stop in my tracks. It\u2019s from Sam\u2019s dad.</p><p>I\u2019ve been wondering about him.</p><p>I hesitate\u2014then click the email open.</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>Just wondering if you got my last email. You know I\u2019m not much of a technological expert, probably sending it off to the wrong place. But here goes again.</p> <p>Hope all is well and you are flourishing in London as ever. You know how proud we are of your success. I see you in the business pages. Amazing. I always knew you were destined for big things, you know that.</p><p>As I said, there is something I\u2019d love to talk to you about. Are you ever down Hampshire way? It\u2019s been so long and I do miss the old days.</p><p>Yours ever,</p><p>Your old</p><p>Dad</p><p>As I get to the end, I feel rather hot around the eyes. I can\u2019t quite believe it. Did Sam not even reply to that last email? Doesn\u2019t he care about his dad? Have they had a big row or something?</p><p>I have no idea what the story is. I have no idea what could have happened between them. All I know is, there\u2019s a father sitting at a computer, putting out feelers to his son, and they\u2019re being ignored, and I can\u2019t bear it. I just can\u2019t. Whatever\u2019s gone before, life\u2019s too short not to make amends. Life\u2019s too short to bear a grudge.</p><p>On impulse, I press reply. I don\u2019t dare reply in Sam\u2019s voice to his own father; that would be going too far. But I can make contact. I can let a lonely old man know that his voice is being heard.</p> <p>Hello.</p><p>This is Sam\u2019s PA. Just to let you know, Sam will be at his company conference at the Chiddingford Hotel in Hampshire next week, April 24 . I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to see you.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Poppy Wyatt</p><p>I press send before I can chicken out, then sit for a few moments, a bit breathless at what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve masqueraded as Sam\u2019s PA. I\u2019ve contacted his father. I\u2019ve waded right into his personal life. He\u2019d be livid if he knew\u2014in fact, the very thought of it makes me quail.</p><p>But sometimes you have to be brave. Sometimes you have to show people what\u2019s important in life. And I have this very strong gut instinct that what I\u2019ve done is the right thing. Maybe not the easy thing\u2014but the right thing.</p><p>I have a vision of Sam\u2019s dad sitting at his desk, his gray head bowed. The computer beeping with a new email, the light of hope in his face as he opens it ... a sudden smile of joy ... turning to his dog, patting his head, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to see Sam, boy!\u201d60</p><p>Yes. It was the right thing to do.</p><p>Exhaling slowly, I open the last email, which is from Blue:</p><p>Hello.</p><p>We\u2019re so sorry to hear that Sam can\u2019t make the Savoy reception. Would he like to nominate another person to attend in his place? Please email over the name and we will be sure to add them to the guest list.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Blue.</p><p>The bus has come to a halt, chugging at a set of traffic lights. I take a bite of muffin and stare silently at the email.</p><p>Another person. That could be anybody.</p><p>I\u2019m free on Monday night. Magnus has a late seminar in Warwick.</p><p>OK. Here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d ever be invited to anything glitzy like this in the normal way of things. Physiotherapists just aren\u2019t. And Magnus\u2019s events are all academic book launches or stuffy college dinners. They\u2019re never at the Savoy. There are never goody bags or cocktails or jazz bands. This is my one and only chance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe this is karma.

Sam would like to nominate Poppy Wyatt.</p><p>50 Is unethical the same as dishonest? This is the kind of moral debate I could have asked Antony about. In different circumstances.</p> <p>51 Which is a shame, because what I\u2019m dying to ask is: Why does Willow keep sending messages via me when she must know I\u2019m not Violet by now? And what\u2019s all this communication through his PA, anyway?</p><p>52 Which makes me wonder: If man can make an emerald these days, why do we all keep on spending loads of money on real ones? Also: Should I get some earrings?</p><p>53 I did actually think it was quite a lot. But I figured that was the hit I had to take. I would certainly never query the price of a ring in a posh shop, never in a million years.</p><p>54 \u201cI could draw you a graph, Poppy. A graph. \u201d</p><p>55 Aha! Clearly the same Ed who was in the Groucho Club, the worse for wear.

I just feel pretty sure that he does.</p><p>7</p> <p>The fake ring\u2019s perfect!</p><p>OK, not perfect. It\u2019s a tad smaller than the original. And a bit tinnier. But who\u2019s going to know without the other one to compare? I\u2019ve worn it most of the afternoon and it feels really comfortable. In fact, it\u2019s lighter than the real thing, which is an advantage.</p><p>Now I\u2019ve finished my last appointment of the day and am standing with my hands spread out on the reception desk. All the patients have gone, even sweet Mrs. Randall, with whom I\u2019ve just had to be quite firm. I told her not to come back here for two weeks. I told her she was perfectly capable of exercising at home alone, and there was no reason she shouldn\u2019t be back on the tennis court.</p><p>Then, of course, it all came out. It turned out she was nervous of letting down her doubles partner, and that\u2019s why she was coming in so often: to give herself confidence. I told her she was absolutely ready and I wanted her to text me her next score before she came back to see me. I said if it came to it, I\u2019d play tennis with her, at which point she laughed and said I was right, she was being nonsensical.</p><p>Then, when she\u2019d gone, Angela told me that Mrs. Randall is some shit-hot player who once played in Junior Wimbledon. Yowser. Probably a good thing we didn\u2019t play, since I can\u2019t even hit a backhand.</p><p>Angela\u2019s gone home too now. It\u2019s just Annalise, Ruby, and me, we\u2019re surveying the ring in silence except for a spring storm outside. One minute it was a bright breezy day; the next, rain was hammering at the windows.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Ruby is nodding energetically. Her hair is up in a ponytail today, and it bounces as she nods. \u201cVery good. You\u2019d never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201c I\u2019d know,\u201d Annalise retorts at once. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same green.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I peer at it in dismay.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, how observant is Magnus?\u201d Ruby raises her eyebrows. \u201cDoes he ever look at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe keep your hands away from him for a while, to be on the safe side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep my hands away from him? How do I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to restrain yourself!\u201d says Annalise tartly. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about his parents?\u201d says Ruby.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bound to want to see it. We\u2019re meeting in the church, so the lights will be pretty dim, but even so ... \u201d I bite my lip, suddenly nervous. \u201cOh God. Does it look real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Ruby at once.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Annalise, equally firmly. \u201cSorry, but it doesn\u2019t. Not if you look carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t let them!\u201d says Ruby. \u201cIf they start looking too closely, create a diversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaint? Pretend to have a fit? Tell them you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant?\u201d I stare at her, wanting to laugh. \u201cAre you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only trying to help,\u201d she says defensively. \u201cMaybe they\u2019d like you to be pregnant. Maybe Wanda\u2019s gunning to be a granny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNo way. She\u2019d freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect! Then she won\u2019t look at the ring. She\u2019ll be too consumed with rage.\u201d Ruby nods in satisfaction, as though she\u2019s solved all my problems. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a raging mother-in-law, thanks very much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be raging either way,\u201d Annalise points out. \u201cYou just have to decide which is worse: pregnant daughter-in-law or flaky daughter-in-law who lost the priceless heirloom ring? I\u2019d say go with pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m pregnant!\u201d I look at the ring again and rub the fake emerald. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say, as much to convince myself as anything. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that Magnus?\u201d says Ruby suddenly. \u201cAcross the street?\u201d</p> <p>I follow her gaze. There he is, holding an umbrella against the rain, waiting for the traffic lights to change.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I leap to my feet and clasp my right hand casually over my left. No. Too unnatural. I thrust my left hand into my uniform pocket, but and my arm is left sticking out at an awkward angle.</p><p>\u201cBad.\u201d Ruby is watching. \u201cReally bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat shall I dooo?\u201d I wail.</p><p>\u201cHand cream.\u201d She reaches for a tube. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m giving you a manicure. Then you can leave a bit of the cream on. Accidentally on purpose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGenius.\u201d I glance over at Annalise and blink in surprise. \u201cEr ... Annalise? What are you doing ?\u201d</p><p>In the thirty seconds since Ruby spotted Magnus, Annalise seems to have applied a fresh layer of lip gloss and sprayed scent on, and is now pulling a few sexy strands of hair out of her ballerina\u2019s bun.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d she says defiantly, as Ruby starts rubbing cream into my hands.</p><p>I only have time to dart her a suspicious look before the door opens and Magnus appears, shaking water from his umbrella.</p><p>\u201cHello, girls!\u201d He beams around as though we\u2019re an appreciative audience waiting for his entrance. Which I suppose we are.</p><p>\u201cMagnus! Let me take your coat.\u201d Annalise has rushed forward. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, Poppy. You\u2019re having your manicure. I\u2019ll do it. And maybe a cup of tea?\u201d</p> <p>Ooh. Typical. I watch as she slides Magnus\u2019s linen jacket from his shoulders. Isn\u2019t she doing that a bit slowly and lingeringly? Why does he need to take his jacket off, anyway? We\u2019re about to go.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re nearly finished.\u201d I glance at Ruby. \u201cAren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hurry,\u201d says Magnus. \u201cPlenty of time.\u201d He looks around the reception and breathes in, as though appreciating some beautiful vista. \u201cMmmm. I remember coming here the first time as though it were yesterday. You remember, Pops? God, that was amazing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He meets my eye with a suggestive glint and I hastily telegraph back, Shut up, you idiot. He is going to get me in so much trouble.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your wrist, Magnus?\u201d Annalise is approaching him with a cup of tea from the machine. \u201cDid Poppy ever give you a three-month follow-up appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looks taken aback. \u201cShould she have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wrist\u2019s fine,\u201d I say firmly.</p><p>\u201cShall I take a look?\u201d Annalise is ignoring me completely. \u201cPoppy shouldn\u2019t be giving you therapy now, you know. Conflict of interests.\u201d She takes his wrist. \u201cWhere was the pain exactly? Here?\u201d She unbuttons his cuff, moving up his arm. \u201cHere?\u201d Her voice deepens slightly and she bats her eyelashes at him. \u201cWhat about ... here?\u201d</p><p>OK. This is the limit.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Annalise!\u201d I beam brightly at her. \u201cBut we\u2019d better be going to the church. For the meeting about our wedding, \u201d I add pointedly.</p><p>\u201cAbout that.\u201d Magnus frowns briefly. \u201cPoppy, can we have a quick chat? Maybe go into your room a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel a flicker of foreboding. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>Even Annalise looks taken aback, and Ruby raises her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cCuppa, Annalise?\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll just be out here. No rush.\u201d</p><p>As I usher Magnus in, my mind is skittering in panic. He knows about the ring. The Scrabble. Everything. He\u2019s having cold feet. He wants a wife he can talk to about Proust.</p><p>\u201cCan you lock the door?\u201d He fiddles with the catch and after a moment has secured it. \u201cThere. Excellent!\u201d As he turns, there\u2019s an unmistakable light in his eyes. \u201cGod, Poppy, you look hot.\u201d</p><p>It takes about five seconds for the penny to drop.</p><p>\u201c What? No. Magnus, you have to be joking.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s heading toward me with an intent, familiar expression. No way. I mean, no way.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I bat him away as he reaches for the top button of my uniform. \u201cI\u2019m at work!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He closes his eyes briefly as though in some paroxysm of bliss. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about this place. Your uniform, maybe. All that white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you want to.\u201d He nibbles one of my earlobes. \u201cCome on ... \u201d</p><p>Damn him for knowing about my earlobes. For a moment\u2014only a moment\u2014I slightly lose my focus. But then, as he makes another salvo on my uniform buttons, I snap back into reality. Ruby and Annalise are three feet away on the other side of the door.61 This cannot happen.</p> <p>\u201cNo! Magnus, I thought you wanted to talk about something serious! The wedding or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d He\u2019s pressing the button which reclines the couch all the way down. \u201cMmm. I remember this bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bed, it\u2019s a professional couch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that massage oil?\u201d He\u2019s reached for a nearby bottle.</p><p>\u201cShhh!\u201d I hiss. \u201cRuby\u2019s right outside! I\u2019ve already had one disciplinary hearing\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this thing? Ultrasound?\u201d He\u2019s grabbed the ultrasound wand. \u201cI bet we could have some fun with this. Does it heat up?\u201d His eyes suddenly glint. \u201cDoes it vibrate ?\u201d</p><p>This is like having a toddler to control.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I step away, putting the couch between him and me. \u201cWe can\u2019t. We just can\u2019t. \u201d I smooth down my uniform.</p><p>For a moment Magnus looks so sulky I think he might shout at me.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say again. \u201cBut it\u2019s like asking you to have sex with a student. You\u2019d get fired. Your career would be over!\u201d</p><p>Magnus seems about to contradict me\u2014then thinks better of whatever he was about to say.</p> <p>\u201cWell, great.\u201d He gives a grumpy shrug. \u201cReally great. What are we supposed to do instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could do loads of things!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cHave a chat? Go through wedding stuff? Only eight more days to go!\u201d</p><p>Magnus doesn\u2019t reply. He doesn\u2019t need to. His lack of enthusiasm is emanating from him like some kind of psychic force.</p><p>\u201cOr have a drink?\u201d I suggest at last. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time to go to the pub before the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he says heavily at last. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the pub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come back here,\u201d I say coaxingly. \u201cAnother day. Maybe at a weekend.\u201d</p><p>What the hell am I promising? Oh God. I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.</p><p>As we head out of the room, Ruby and Annalise look up artificially from magazines they obviously haven\u2019t been reading.</p> <p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d says Ruby.</p><p>\u201cYes, great!\u201d I smooth my skirt. \u201cJust ... wedding chitchat. Veils, almonds, that kind of thing... . Anyway, we\u2019d better be off.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve glimpsed my reflection in the mirror. My cheeks are bright scarlet and I\u2019m talking nonsense. Total giveaway.</p><p>\u201cHope it goes well.\u201d Ruby glances meaningfully at the ring, then at me.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText us!\u201d chips in Annalise. \u201cWhatever happens. We\u2019ll be dying to know!\u201d</p><p>The thing to remember is, the ring fooled Magnus. And if it fooled him, surely it\u2019ll fool his parents? As we arrive at St. Edmund\u2019s Parish Church, I feel more optimistic than I have for ages. St. Edmund\u2019s is a big, grand church in Marylebone. In fact we chose it because it\u2019s so beautiful. As we head inside, someone\u2019s practicing a flashy piece on the organ. There are pink and white flowers for another wedding decorating all the pews and a general air of expectancy.</p><p>I suddenly feel a tingle of excitement. In eight days, that\u2019ll be us! A week from tomorrow, the place will be festooned with white silk and posies. All my friends and family will be waiting excitedly. The trumpeter will be in the organ loft and I\u2019ll be in my dress and Magnus will be standing at the altar in his designer waistcoat.62 It\u2019s really, really happening!</p><p>I can already see Wanda inside the church, peering at some old statue. As she turns, I force myself to wave confidently, as though everything\u2019s great and we\u2019re the best of friends and they don\u2019t intimidate me at all.</p><p>Magnus is right, I tell myself. I\u2019ve been overreacting. I\u2019ve let them get to me. They probably can\u2019t wait to welcome me into the family.</p><p>After all, I beat them all at Scrabble, didn\u2019t I?</p><p>\u201cJust think.\u201d I clutch Magnus\u2019s arm. \u201cNot long now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Magnus answers his phone, which must be on vibrate. \u201cOh, hi, Neil.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great. Neil is Magnus\u2019s keenest undergraduate and is writing a thesis on symbols in the work of Coldplay.63 They\u2019ll be on the phone for hours. Mouthing apologetically, he disappears out of the church.</p><p>You\u2019d think he could have turned his phone off. I\u2019ve turned mine off.</p><p>Anyway, never mind.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d I exclaim as Wanda comes down the aisle. \u201cGood to see you! Isn\u2019t this exciting?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not exactly proffering my ring hand. But neither am I hiding it. It\u2019s neutral. It\u2019s the Switzerland of hands.</p><p>\u201cPoppy.\u201d Wanda does a dramatic swoop toward my cheek. \u201cDear girl. Now, let me introduce Paul. Where\u2019s he got to? How is your burn, by the way?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I can\u2019t move.</p><p>Paul. The dermatologist. Shit. I forgot about the dermatologist. How could I forget about the dermatologist? How could I be so stupid ? I was so relieved to get a ring substitute, I forgot I was supposed to be mortally injured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken your bandage off,\u201d observes Wanda.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYes. I did. Because ... my hand\u2019s much better, actually. Much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be too careful, though, even with these small injuries.\u201d Wanda is ushering me down the aisle, and there\u2019s nothing I can do except walk obediently. \u201cColleague of ours in Chicago stubbed his toe and just soldiered on; next thing we know, he\u2019s in hospital with gangrene! I said to Antony\u2014&gt;\u201d Wanda interrupts herself. \u201c Here she is. The fianc\u00e9e. The betrothed. The patient.\u201d</p><p>Antony and an elderly man in a purple V-neck both turn from peering at a painting hanging on a stone pillar and peer at me instead.</p><p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d says Antony. \u201cLet me introduce our neighbor, Paul McAndrew, one of the most eminent professors of dermatology in the country. Specialist in burns; isn\u2019t that fortunate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d My voice is a nervous squeak and my hands have crept behind my back. \u201cLike I say, it\u2019s a lot better\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look,\u201d says Paul, in a pleasant, matter-of-fact way.</p> <p>There\u2019s no way out. Mortified, I slowly extend my left hand. Everybody looks at my smooth, unblemished skin in silence.</p><p>\u201c Where was the burn, exactly?\u201d asks Paul at last.</p><p>\u201cUm ... here.\u201d I gesture vaguely at my thumb.</p><p>\u201cWas it a scald? A cigarette burn?\u201d He\u2019s taken hold of my hand and is feeling it with an expert touch.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was ... um ... on a radiator.\u201d I swallow. \u201cIt was really sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer whole hand was bandaged.\u201d Wanda sounds bemused. \u201cShe looked like a war victim! That was only yesterday!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The doctor relinquishes my hand. \u201cWell, it seems OK now, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he says kindly to me. \u2019Any pain? Any tenderness?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head mutely.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll prescribe some aqueous cream,\u201d he says kindly. \u201cIn case the symptoms return. How about that?\u201d</p><p>I can see Wanda and Antony exchanging looks. Great. They obviously think I\u2019m a total hypochondriac.</p><p>OK. Fine. I\u2019ll go with that. I\u2019ll be the family hypochondriac. It can be one of my little quirks. Could be worse. At least they haven\u2019t exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell have you done with our priceless ring and what\u2019s that piece of junk you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>As though reading my mind, Wanda glances again at my hand.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s emerald ring, do you see, Antony?\u201d She points at my hand. \u201cMagnus gave it to Poppy when he proposed.\u201d</p><p>OK. I\u2019m definitely not making this up: There\u2019s a pointed edge to her voice. And now she\u2019s shooting Antony a significant look. What\u2019s going on? Did she want the ring herself? Was Magnus not supposed to give it away? I feel like I\u2019ve blundered into some tricksy family situation which is invisible to me but they\u2019re all too polite to mention it and I\u2019m never going to know what anybody really thinks.</p><p>But then, if it\u2019s so special, how come she hasn\u2019t noticed it\u2019s a fake? Perversely, I feel a teeny bit disappointed in the Tavishes for not realizing. They think they\u2019re so clever\u2014and then they can\u2019t even spot a false emerald.</p><p>\u201cSuper engagement ring,\u201d says Paul politely. \u201cThat\u2019s a real one-off, I can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I nod. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage. Totally unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Poppy!\u201d chimes in Antony, who has been examining a nearby statue. \u201cNow, that reminds me. There\u2019s something I was going to ask you.\u201d</p><p>Me?</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say in surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would ask Magnus, but I gather it\u2019s more your area than his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire away.\u201d I smile up at him politely, expecting some weddingy question along the lines of \u2018How many bridesmaids will there be?\u2019 or \u2018What flowers are you having?\u2019 or even, \u2018Were you surprised when Magnus proposed?\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of McDowell\u2019s new book on the Stoics?\u201d His eyes are fixed beadily on mine. \u201cHow does it compare to Whittaker? \u201c</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too poleaxed to react. What? What do I think of what ?</p> <p>\u201cAh yes!\u201d Wanda is nodding vigorously. \u201cPoppy is somewhat of an expert on Greek philosophy, Paul. She foxed us all at Scrabble with the word aporia, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Somehow I manage to keep smiling.</p><p>Aporia.</p><p>That was one of the words Sam texted me. I\u2019d had a few glasses of wine and was feeling pretty confident by then. I have a hazy memory of myself laying down the tiles and saying that Greek philosophy was one of my great interests.</p><p>Why? Why, why, why? If I could go back in time, that\u2019s the moment I\u2019d go up to myself and say, \u201cPoppy! Enough!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d I attempt an easy smile. \u201cAporia!

Why the hell did I pretend I knew about Greek philosophy? What was I thinking ?</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t quite got to the McDowell book yet.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cAlthough obviously it\u2019s on my reading list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe Stoicism has often been misunderstood as a philosophy, isn\u2019t that right, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I nod, trying to look as knowledgeable as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s completely misunderstood. Very much so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Stoics weren\u2019t emotionless, as I understand it.\u201d He gestures with his hands as though lecturing to three hundred people. \u201cThey simply valued the virtue of fortitude. Apparently they displayed such impassiveness to hostility that their aggressors wondered if they were made of stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary!\u201d says Paul with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it, Poppy?\u201d Antony turns to me. \u201cWhen the Gauls attacked Rome, the old senators sat in the forum, calmly waiting. The attackers were so taken aback by their dispassionate attitude, they thought they must be statues. One Gaul even tugged the beard of a senator, to check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right.\u201d I nod confidently. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it.\u201d</p><p>As long as Antony just keeps talking and I keep nodding, then I\u2019ll be OK.</p><p>\u201cFascinating! And what happened next?\u201d Paul turns expectantly to me.</p><p>I glance at Antony for the answer\u2014but he\u2019s waiting for me too. And so is Wanda.</p><p>Three eminent professors. All waiting for me to tell them about Greek philosophy.</p> <p>\u201cWell!\u201d I pause thoughtfully, as though wondering where to begin. \u201cWell, now. It was ... interesting. In many, many ways. For philosophy. And for Greece. And for history. And humanity. One could, in fact, say that this was the most significant moment in Greek ... ness.\u201d I come to a finish, hoping no one will realize I haven\u2019t actually answered the question.</p><p>There\u2019s a puzzled pause.</p><p>\u201cBut what happened ?\u201d says Wanda, a little impatiently.</p><p>\u201cOh, the senators were massacred, of course,\u201d says Antony with a shrug. \u201cBut what I wanted to ask you, Poppy, was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u2019That\u2019s a lovely painting!\u201d I cry desperately, pointing to a picture hanging on a pillar. \u201cLook over there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, now, that is an interesting piece.\u201d He wanders over to have a look.</p><p>The great thing about Antony is, he\u2019s so curious about everything, he\u2019s quite easily distracted.</p><p>\u201cI need to check something on my calendar,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cI\u2019ll just ... \u201d</p><p>My legs are shaking slightly as I escape to a nearby pew. This is a disaster. Now I\u2019ll now have to pretend to be a Greek philosophy expert for the rest of my life. Every Christmas and family gathering, I\u2019ll have to have a view on Greek philosophy. Not to mention be able to recite Robert Burns\u2019s poetry.</p><p>I should never, ever have cheated. This is karma. This is my punishment.</p><p>Anyway, too late. I did.</p><p>I\u2019m going to have to start taking notes. I take out my phone, open a new email, and start typing notes to myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THINGS TO DO BEFORE WEDDING</p><p>1.

(Hypnosis?)64</p><p>I look at the list for a few moments. It\u2019s fine. I can be that person. It\u2019s not that different from me.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, you know my views on art in churches.\u201d Antony\u2019s voice is ringing out. \u201cAbsolutely scandalous ... \u201d</p><p>I shrink down out of view, before anyone can drag me into the conversation. Everyone knows Antony\u2019s views on art in churches, mostly because he\u2019s the founder of a national campaign to turn churches into art galleries and get rid of all the vicars. A few years ago he was on TV and said, \u201cTreasures such as these should not be left in the hands of Philistines.\u201d It got repeated everywhere, and there was a big fuss and headlines like PROFESSOR DUBS CLERICS PHILISTINES65 and PROF DISSES REVS (that one was in The Sun ).</p> <p>I wish he\u2019d keep his voice down. What if the vicar hears him? It\u2019s not exactly tactful.</p><p>Now I can hear him laying into the order of service.</p><p>\u201c Dearly beloved. \u201d He gives that sarcastic little laugh. \u201cBeloved by whom? Beloved by the stars and the cosmos? Does anyone expect us to believe that some beneficent being is up there, loving us? In the sight of God. I ask you, Wanda! Absolute weak-minded nonsense.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly see the vicar of the church walking up the aisle toward us. He\u2019s obviously heard Antony, from his glowering expression. Yikes.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Poppy.\u201d</p><p>I hastily leap up from my pew. \u201cGood evening, Reverend Fox! How are you? We were just saying ... how lovely the church looks.\u201d I smile lamely.</p> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he says frostily.</p><p>\u201cHave you ... \u201d I swallow. \u201cHave you met my future father-in-law? Professor Antony Tavish.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, Antony shakes hands quite pleasantly with Reverend Fox, but there\u2019s still a prickly atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re doing a reading, Professor Tavish,\u201d says Reverend Fox after he\u2019s checked a few other details. \u201cFrom the Bible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d Antony\u2019s eyes glitter at the vicar.</p><p>\u201cI thought not.\u201d The Reverend Fox smiles back aggressively. \u201cNot really your \u2018bag,\u2019 shall we say.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. You can feel the animosity crackling through the air between them. Should I make a joke, lighten the atmosphere?</p><p>Maybe not.</p> <p>Reverend Fox checks his notes. \u201cAnd, Poppy, you\u2019ll be given away by your brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d I nod. \u201cToby and Tom. They\u2019re going to lead me down the aisle, either side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brothers!\u201d chimes in Paul with interest. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice idea. But why not your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my father is ... \u201d I hesitate. \u201cWell, actually, both my parents are dead.\u201d</p><p>And, like night follows day, here it is. The awkward pause. I stare at the stone floor, counting down the seconds, waiting patiently for it to pass.</p><p>How many awkward pauses have I caused in the last ten years? It\u2019s always the same. No one knows where to look. No one knows what to say. At least this time no one\u2019s trying to give me a hug.</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl,\u201d says Paul, in consternation. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d I cut him off brightly. \u201cReally. It was an accident. Ten years ago. I don\u2019t talk about it. I don\u2019t think about it. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him as off-puttingly as I can. I\u2019m not getting into this. I never do get into it. It\u2019s all folded up in my mind. Packaged away.</p><p>No one wants to hear stories about bad things. That\u2019s the truth. I remember that my tutor at college once asked me if I was all right and if I wanted to talk. The moment I started, he said, \u201cYou mustn\u2019t lose your confidence, Poppy!\u201d in this brisk way that meant \u201cActually I don\u2019t want to hear about this, please stop now.\u201d</p><p>There was a counseling group. But I didn\u2019t go. It clashed with hockey practice. Anyway, what\u2019s there to talk about? My parents died. My aunt and uncle took us in. My cousins had left home anyway, so they had the bedrooms and everything.</p><p>It happened. There\u2019s nothing else to say.</p><p>\u201c Beautiful engagement ring, Poppy,\u201d says Reverend Fox at last, and everyone seizes on the distraction.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it lovely? It\u2019s an antique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family piece,\u201d puts in Wanda.</p><p>\u201cVery special.\u201d Paul pats my hand kindly. \u201cAn absolute one-off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The back door opens with a clang of iron bolts. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d comes a familiar piercing voice. \u201cIt\u2019s been a bugger of a day.\u201d</p><p>Striding up the aisle, holding several bags full of silk, is Lucinda. She\u2019s wearing a beige shift dress and massive sunglasses on her head and looks hassled. \u201cReverend Fox! Did you get my email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lucinda,\u201d says Reverend Fox wearily. \u201cI did. I\u2019m afraid the church pillars cannot be sprayed silver under any circumstances.\u201d</p><p>Lucinda stops dead, and a bolt of gray silk starts unraveling, all the way down the aisle.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t ? Well, what am I supposed to do? I promised the florist silver columns!\u201d She sinks down on a nearby pew. \u201cThis bloody wedding! If it\u2019s not one thing it\u2019s another\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lucinda, dear,\u201d says Wanda, swooping down on her fondly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing a marvelous job. How\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s fine.\u201d Lucinda waves a hand. \u201cNot that I ever see her. I\u2019m up to my eyes with it\u2014where is that dratted Clemency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve booked the cars, by the way,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cAll done. And the confetti. I was also wondering, shall I book some rosebuds for the ushers\u2019 buttonholes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could,\u201d she says a little tetchily. \u201cI would appreciate it.\u201d She looks up and seems to take me in properly for the first time. \u201cOh, Poppy. One piece of good news: I\u2019ve got your ring! It was caught on the lining of my bag.\u201d</p> <p>She pulls out the emerald ring and holds it out. I\u2019m so blindsided, all I can do is blink.</p><p>The real ring. My real, vintage, priceless emerald engagement ring. Right there, in front of my eyes.</p><p>How did she\u2014</p><p>What the hell\u2014</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to look at anybody else. Even so, I\u2019m aware of glances of astonishment all around me, crisscrossing like laser beams, moving from my fake ring to the real one and back again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand\u2014\u201d begins Paul at last.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, everyone?\u201d Magnus is striding up the aisle, taking in the tableau. \u201cSomeone seen a ghost? The Holy Ghost?\u201d He laughs at his own joke, but no one joins in.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the ring\u201d\u2014Wanda seems to have found her voice\u2014\u201cthen what\u2019s that?\u201d She points at the fake on my finger, which of course now looks like something out of a fairground machine.</p><p>My throat is so tight I can hardly breathe. Somehow I have to save this situation. Somehow. They must never know I lost the ring.</p><p>\u201cYes! I ... thought you\u2019d be surprised!\u201d Somehow I find some words; somehow I muster a smile. I feel as though I\u2019m walking over a bridge which I\u2019m having to construct myself as I go, out of playing cards. \u201cI actually ... had a replica made!\u201d I try to sound casual. \u201cBecause I lent the original to Lucinda.\u201d</p><p>I look at her desperately, willing her to go along with this. Thankfully she seems to have realized what a faux pas she\u2019s committed.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she joins in quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I borrowed the ring for ... for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014for design reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! We thought the ring could be inspiration for\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2014the napkin rings,\u201d I grasp from nowhere. \u201cEmerald napkin rings! Which we didn\u2019t go with in the end,\u201d I add carefully.</p><p>There\u2019s silence. I pluck up the courage to look around.</p><p>Wanda\u2019s face is creased deeply with a frown. Magnus looks perplexed. Paul has taken a step backward from the group, as though to say, \u201cNothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo thanks very much.\u201d I take the ring from Lucinda with trembling hands. \u201cI\u2019ll just ... put that back on.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve crashed onto the far bank and am clinging to the grass. Made it. Thank God.</p><p>But as I rip the fake ring off, drop it into my bag, and slide the real thing on, my mind is in overdrive. How come Lucinda had the ring? What about Mrs. Fairfax? What the fuck is going on ?</p><p>\u201c Why exactly did you have a replica made, sweets?\u201d Magnus looks totally baffled.</p><p>I stare at him, desperately trying to think. Why would I have gone to all the trouble and expense of making a fake ring?</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought it would be nice to have two,\u201d I venture feebly after a pause.</p><p>Oh God. No. Bad. I should have said, \u201cFor travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted two rings?\u201d Wanda seems almost speechless.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope that desire won\u2019t apply to your husband as well as your engagement ring!\u201d Antony says, with heavy humor. \u201cEh, Magnus?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHa-ha-ha!\u201d I give a loud, sycophantic laugh. \u201cHa-ha-ha!

I\u2019ve never experienced such a near-miss in my life. I\u2019m not sure Wanda believes me. She keeps shooting me suspicious looks, plus she\u2019s asked me how much the replica ring cost and where I had it made, and all sorts of questions I really didn\u2019t want to answer.</p><p>What does she think? That I was going to sell the original or something?</p><p>We\u2019ve practiced me coming up the aisle, and going back down the aisle together, and worked out where we\u2019ll kneel and sign the register. And now the vicar has suggested a run-through of the vows.</p> <p>But I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t say those magical words with Antony there, making clever-clever comments and mocking every phrase. It\u2019ll be different in the wedding. He\u2019ll have to shut up.</p><p>\u201c\u201cMagnus.\u201d I pull him aside with a whisper. \u201cLet\u2019s not do our vows today after all. Not with your father here. They\u2019re too special to ruin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He looks surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t mind either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say them once. On the day.\u201d I squeeze his hand. \u201cFor real.\u201d</p><p>Even without Antony, I don\u2019t want to preempt the big moment, I realize. I don\u2019t want to rehearse. It\u2019ll take the specialness out of it all.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I agree.\u201d Magnus nods. \u201cSo ... are we done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not done!\u201d says Lucinda, sounding outraged. \u201cFar from it! I want Poppy to walk up the aisle again. You went far too fast for the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I shrug, heading to the back of the church.</p><p>\u201cOrgan, please!\u201d shrieks Lucinda. \u201cOr-gan! From the top! Glide smoothly, Poppy,\u201d she says as I pass. \u201cYou\u2019re wobbling! Clemency, where are those cups of tea?\u201d</p><p>Clemency is just back from a Costa run, and I can see her out of the corner of my eye, hastily tearing open sachets of sugar and milk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help!\u201d I say, and break off from gliding. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d whispers Clemency as I come over. \u201cAntony wants three sugars, Magnus is the cappuccino, Wanda has the biscotti ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my double-chocolate extra-cream muffin?\u201d I say with a puzzled frown, and Clemency jumps sky-high in the air.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I can go back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoke!\u201d I say. \u201cJust joking!\u201d</p><p>The longer Clemency works for Lucinda, the more like a terrified rabbit she looks. It really can\u2019t be good for her health.</p><p>Lucinda takes her tea (milk, no sugar) with the briefest of nods. She seems totally hassled again and has laid a massive spreadsheet printout across the pews. It\u2019s such a mess of highlighter and scribbled notes and Post-it notes, I\u2019m amazed she\u2019s organized anything.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh God,\u201d she\u2019s saying under her breath. \u201cWhere\u2019s the fucking florist\u2019s number?\u201d She riffles through a bundle of papers, then clasps her hair despairingly. \u201cClemency!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I Google it for you?\u201d I suggest.</p> <p>\u201cClemency will Google it. Clemency !\u201d Poor Clemency starts so badly, tea slops out of one of the cups.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d I say hastily, and relieve her of the Costa tray.</p><p>\u201cIf you could, that would be helpful.\u201d Lucinda exhales sharply. \u201cBecause you know, we are all here for your benefit, Poppy. And the wedding is only a week away. And there is still an awful lot to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cUm ... sorry.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea where Magnus and his parents have got to, so I head toward the back of the church, holding the Costa tray full of cups, trying to glide, imagining myself in my veil.</p><p>\u201cRidiculous!\u201d I hear Wanda\u2019s muffled voice first. \u201c Far too fast.\u201d</p><p>I look around uncertainly\u2014then realize it\u2019s coming from behind a heavy closed wooden door to the side of the church. They must be in the antechapel.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows ...

They\u2019re not looking at the art. They\u2019re telling each other what a terrible choice their son has made for a wife. They\u2019re making bets that we\u2019ll be divorced within a year.</p><p>As Magnus emerges from the antechapel again, I take a deep breath, feeling sick with nerves.</p><p>\u201cSo ... what do your parents make of all this?\u201d I say as lightly as I can manage. \u201cI mean, your father\u2019s not really into church, is he?

I don\u2019t want to hear the truth\u2014that his parents think I\u2019m crap.</p><p>\u201cJust got to check an email.\u201d Is it my imagination or is Magnus avoiding my gaze?</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I peel away from him miserably and go to sit by myself on a side pew. For a few moments I hunch my shoulders, trying to resist the urge to cry. At last I reach for my phone and switch it on. I might as well catch up with some stuff. I haven\u2019t looked at it for hours. As I switch it on, I almost recoil at the number of buzzes and flashes and bleeps which greet me. How many messages have I missed? I quickly text the concierge at the Berrow Hotel, telling him he can call off the search for the ring, and thanking him for his time. Then I turn my attention to the messages.</p><p>Top of the pile is a text from Sam, which arrived about twenty minutes ago:</p><p>On way to Germany over weekend. Heading to mountainous region. Will be off radar for a bit.</p> <p>Seeing his name fills me with a longing to talk to someone, and I text back:</p><p>Hi there. Sounds cool. Why Germany?</p><p>There\u2019s no reply, but I don\u2019t care; it\u2019s cathartic just to type.</p><p>So much for fake ring. Did not work. Was found out and now M\u2019s parents think I\u2019m a weirdo.</p><p>For a moment I wonder whether to tell him that Lucinda had the ring and ask him what he thinks. But ... no. It\u2019s too complicated. He won\u2019t want to get into it. I send the text\u2014then realize he might think I\u2019m having a go at him. Quickly I type a follow-up:</p><p>Thx for help, anyway. Appreciate it.</p><p>Maybe I should have a look at his in-box. I\u2019ve been neglecting it. There are so many emails with the same subject heading, I find myself squinting at the screen in puzzlement\u2014till it dawns on me. Of course. Everyone\u2019s responded to my invitation to send in ideas! These are all the replies!</p><p>For the first time this afternoon, I feel a small glow of pride in myself. If one of these people has come up with a groundbreaking idea and revolutionizes Sam\u2019s company, then it will all be down to me.</p><p>I click on the first one, full of anticipation.</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>I think we should have yoga at lunchtimes, funded by the company, and several others agree with me.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Sally Brewer.</p><p>I frown uncertainly. It\u2019s not exactly what I was expecting, but I suppose yoga is a good idea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK, next one.</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>Thanks for your email.

Presentations! This is fantastic!</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>Sorry to bother you again.</p><p>If we don\u2019t want to work in a team after all, will we be penalized? I have fallen out with my team, but now they know all my ideas, which is totally unfair.</p><p>Just so you know, I had the idea about restructuring the marketing department first. Not Carol.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Mandy</p><p>OK. Well, obviously you have to expect a few glitches. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s still a positive result ...</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>I\u2019m sorry to do this, but I wish to make a formal complaint about the behavior of Carol Hanratty.</p><p>She has behaved totally unprofessionally in the new-ideas exercise, and I am forced to take the rest of the day off, due to my great distress. Judy is also too distressed to work for the rest of the day, and we are thinking of contacting our union.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Mandy</p><p>What? What?</p><p>Dear Sam,</p><p>Forgive the long email. You ask for ideas.</p><p>Where to start?</p><p>I have worked at this company for fifteen years, during which time a long process of disillusionment has silted up my very veins, until my mental processes ...</p><p>This guy\u2019s email is about fifteen pages long. I drop my phone into my lap, my jaw slack.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe all these replies. I never ever meant to cause all this kerfuffle. Why are people so stupid ? Why do they have to fight? What on earth have I stirred up?</p><p>I\u2019ve read only the first few emails. There are about thirty more to go. If I forward all these to Sam, and he steps off the plane in Germany and gets them in one fell swoop ... I suddenly hear his voice again: round-robin emails are the work of the devil.</p><p>And I sent one out in his name. To the whole company. Without consulting him.</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019m really wishing I could go back in time. It seemed like such a great idea. What was I thinking ? All I know is, I can\u2019t land this on him out of the blue. I need to explain it all to him first. Tell him what I was trying to achieve.</p><p>My mind is ticking over now. I mean, he\u2019s in a plane. He\u2019s off-radar. And it\u2019s Friday night, after all. There\u2019s no point forwarding anything to him. Maybe everyone will have calmed down by Monday. Yes.</p><p>The phone suddenly bleeps with a text and I jump, startled.</p><p>Taking off. Anything I need to know about? Sam</p><p>I stare at the phone, my heart beating with slight paranoia. Does he need to know about this right at this very moment? Does he need to?</p><p>No. He does not.</p><p>Not right now. Have a good trip! Poppy</p><p>61 In fact, probably pressing a glass up to it.</p><p>62 His waistcoat cost nearly the same amount as my dress.</p><p>63 I think cymbals in the work of Coldplay would make more sense, but what do I know?</p><p>64 Wanda made beef stroganoff for us the first time I met her. How could I tell her the truth, which is that it makes me gag?</p><p>65 He was on Newsnight and everything. According to Magnus, Antony loved all the attention, although he pretended he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s been saying even more-controversial things ever since, but none has ever taken off like the Philistines thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>8</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do about Antony and Wanda and Antechapelgate, as I\u2019ve named it in my head. So I\u2019ve done nothing. I\u2019ve said nothing.</p><p>I know I\u2019m avoiding it. I know it\u2019s weak. I know I should face the situation. But I can barely even take it in, let alone talk about it. Especially to Magnus.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how good at acting I was. All weekend, I\u2019ve given nothing away. I\u2019ve had dinner with the Tavish family. I\u2019ve been out for a drink with Ruby and Annalise. I\u2019ve laughed and talked and exclaimed and joked and had sex. And all the time there\u2019s been this little gnawing pain in my chest. I\u2019m almost getting used to it.</p> <p>If they\u2019d say something to me, I\u2019d almost feel better. We could have a stand-up row, and I could convince them that I love Magnus and I\u2019m going to support his career and I do have a brain really. But they\u2019ve said nothing. They\u2019ve been outwardly charming and pleasant, politely inquiring about our house-hunting plans and offering me glasses of wine.</p><p>Which only makes it worse. It confirms that I\u2019m an outsider. I\u2019m not even allowed into the family powwow about how unsuitable this new girlfriend of Magnus\u2019s is.</p><p>It would even be OK if Magnus hated his parents and didn\u2019t respect their views and we could just write them off as loonies. But he does respect them. He likes them. They get on really well. They agree on most things, and when they don\u2019t agree it\u2019s with good nature and banter. On every subject.</p><p>Every subject except me.</p><p>I can\u2019t think about it for too long, because I get all upset and panicky, so I allow myself only a tiny snippet of worry at a time. I\u2019ve had my quota for this evening. I sat in a Starbucks after work, nursing a hot chocolate, and got quite morose.</p> <p>But right now, looking at me, you\u2019d have no idea. I\u2019m in my best LBD and high heels. My makeup is immaculate. My eyes are sparkling (two cocktails.) I caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror just now, and I look like a carefree girl, wearing an engagement ring, drinking cosmos at the Savoy, with nothing to worry about.</p><p>And, to be truthful, my mood is a lot better than it was. Partly because of the cocktails and partly because I\u2019m so thrilled to be here. I\u2019ve never been to the Savoy in my life before. It\u2019s amazing!</p><p>The party is in a stunning room with paneling and spectacular chandeliers everywhere and waiters handing out cocktails on trays. A jazz band is playing and, all around, smartly dressed people are chatting in clusters. There are lots of back slaps and handshakes and high fives going on, and everyone seems in a great mood. I don\u2019t know a single person, obviously, but I\u2019m happy just to watch. Every time someone notices me standing on my own and starts to approach, I get out my phone to check my messages, and they turn away again.</p><p>This is the great thing about a phone. It\u2019s like an escort.</p><p>Lucinda keeps texting, telling me how she\u2019s in North London, looking at another variety of gray silk, and do I have any thoughts on texture? Magnus has texted from Warwick about some research trip he\u2019s cooking up with a professor there. Meanwhile, I\u2019m having quite a long conversation with Ruby about the blind date she\u2019s on. The only thing is, it\u2019s quite hard to text and hold a cocktail at the same time, so at last I put my cosmo down on a nearby table and fire off some replies:</p><p>Sure, the gray slub silk will be fine. Thanks so much!! Love, Poppy xxxxx</p> <p>I don\u2019t think ordering two steaks is necessarily creepy ... maybe he is on Atkins diet??? Keep me posted! P xxxxx</p><p>Sounds fab, can I come too?! P xxxxx</p><p>There are scads of messages for Sam too. Loads more people have replied to the new-ideas request. Many have enclosed long attachments and CVs. There are even a couple of videos. People must have been busy over the weekend. I wince as I catch sight of one entitled 1,001 ideas for WGC\u2014part 1 and avert my eyes.</p><p>What I was hoping was that everything would calm down over the weekend and people would forget all about it. But at about eight this morning, the avalanche of emails began, and they keep flying back and forth. There are still rumors that this is all some big audition for a job. There\u2019s a bitter dispute about which department had the idea of expanding to the States first. Malcolm keeps sending tetchy emails asking who approved this initiative, and the whole thing is basically mayhem. Don\u2019t these people have lives ?</p><p>It makes me hyperventilate slightly whenever I think about it. So I have a new coping technique: I\u2019m not. It can wait till tomorrow.</p><p>And so can Willow\u2019s most recent email to Sam. I\u2019ve now decided she must not only have supermodel good looks but be amazing in bed and a gazillionairess, to make up for her foul temper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Today she\u2019s sent him yet another long, tedious rant, saying that she wants Sam to find her a special brand of German exfoliator while he\u2019s over there, but he probably won\u2019t bother and that\u2019s just like him, after all that p\u00e2t\u00e9 she dragged back from France for him, it made her gag but she still did it, but that\u2019s the kind of person she is and he could really learn from that, but has he EVER wanted to learn from her?

What if he gets pissed off that he has to take time out of his schedule to go and present flowers? How could I make this easier for him?</p> <p>I hesitate for a moment, then quickly type an email to Lindsay.</p><p>Hi, Lindsay,</p><p>I want to give you something in my office. Something you\u2019ll like. Stop by tomorrow. Anytime.</p><p>Sam xxxxx</p><p>I press send without rereading it and take a swig of cosmo. For about twenty seconds I\u2019m relaxed, savoring my drink, wondering when the canap\u00e9s will start to arrive. Then, as though an alarm clock has gone off, I start.</p><p>Wait. I put kisses after Sam\u2019s name. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. People don\u2019t put kisses on professional emails.</p> <p>Shit. I retrieve the email and reread it, wincing. I\u2019m so used to kisses, they popped out automatically. But Sam never puts kisses. Ever.</p><p>Should I somehow try to un send the kisses?</p><p>Dear Lindsay, just to clarify, I did not mean to add kisses</p><p>No. Awful. I\u2019ll have to leave it. I\u2019m probably overreacting, anyway. She probably won\u2019t even notice\u2014</p><p>Oh God. An email reply has already arrived from Lindsay. That was quick. I click it open and stare at the message.</p><p>See you then, Sam.</p><p>Lindsay xx ;)</p><p>Two kisses and a winky face. Is that normal?</p> <p>I stare at it for a few moments, trying to convince myself that it is.</p><p>Yes. Yes, I think that\u2019s normal. It could definitely be normal. Simply friendly office correspondence.</p><p>I put my phone away, drain my drink, and look around for another. There\u2019s a waitress standing a few yards away, and I start to thread my way through the crowds.</p><p>\u201c ... policy Sam Roxton\u2019s idea?\u201d A man\u2019s voice attracts my attention. \u201cFucking ludicrous. \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Sam ... \u201d</p><p>I stop dead, pretending to fiddle with my phone. A group of men in suits has paused nearby. They\u2019re all younger than Sam and very well dressed. They must be his colleagues.</p><p>I wonder if I can match the faces to the emails. I bet that one with the olive skin is Justin Cole, who sent the round robin telling everyone that casual dressing on Fridays was compulsory and could everyone please do it with style ? He looks like the fashion police, in his black suit and skinny tie.</p><p>\u201cIs he here?\u201d says a blond guy.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him,\u201d replies the olive-skinned man, draining a shot glass.66 \u201cStubborn fuck.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks in surprise. Well, that\u2019s not very nice.</p><p>My phone bleeps with a text and I click on it, grateful to have something to occupy my fingers. Ruby has sent me a photo of some brown hair, with the message:</p><p>Is this a toupee???</p><p>I can\u2019t suppress a snort of laughter. Somehow she\u2019s managed to snap a photo of her date\u2019s head from behind. How did she manage that? Didn\u2019t he notice?</p><p>I squint at the picture. It looks like normal hair to me. I\u2019ve no idea why Ruby\u2019s so obsessed by toupees, anyway. Just because of that one disastrous blind date she had last year, where the guy turned out to be fifty-nine, not thirty-nine.67</p><p>Don\u2019t think so. Looks fine! xxxxxx</p><p>As I look up, the men who were talking have moved away into the crowd. Damn. I was quite intrigued by that conversation.</p><p>I take another cosmo and a few delicious pieces of sushi (already this evening would have cost me about fifty quid if I was paying for it) and am about to head over toward the jazz band when I hear the screechy sound of a microphone being turned on. I swivel round\u2014and it\u2019s only about five feet away on a small podium, which I hadn\u2019t noticed. A blond girl in a black trouser suit taps the microphone and says, \u2018Ladies and gentlemen. May I have your attention please?\u2019 After a moment, she says more loudly, \u2018People! It\u2019s time for the speeches!

I\u2019m being pushed straight toward the podium, which is really not where I want to be\u2014but I don\u2019t have much choice.</p><p>\u201cSo, here we are!\u201d The blond woman spreads her arms. \u201cWelcome to this celebration of the merger of ourselves, Johnson Ellison, and the wonderful Greene Retail. This is a marriage of hearts and minds as much as companies, and we have many, many people to thank. Our managing director, Patrick Gowan, showed the initial vision which led to us standing here now. Patrick, get up here!\u201d</p><p>A bearded guy in a pale suit walks onto the podium, smiling modestly and shaking his head, and everyone starts clapping, including me.</p><p>\u201cKeith Burnley\u2014what can I say? He\u2019s been an inspiration to us all, the blonde continues.\u201d</p> <p>The trouble with standing right at the front of the crowd is that you feel really conspicuous. I\u2019m trying to listen attentively and look interested, but none of these names mean anything to me. Maybe I should have done some homework. I surreptitiously get my phone out and wonder if I can discreetly find the email about the merger.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know he\u2019s here somewhere ... \u201d She\u2019s looking around, shading her eyes. \u201cHe tried to wriggle out of coming tonight, but we had to have the man himself, Mr. White Globe Consulting, Mr. Sam Roxton!\u201d</p><p>My head jerks up in shock. No. That can\u2019t be right, he can\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Fresh applause breaks out as Sam strides onto the podium, wearing a dark suit and a slight frown. I\u2019m so stunned I can\u2019t even move. He was in Germany. He wasn\u2019t coming tonight. What\u2019s he doing here?</p> <p>From the way his face jolts in surprise as he sees me, I guess he\u2019s wondering the same thing.</p><p>I am so busted. Why did I think I could get away with gate-crashing a big posh party like this?</p><p>My face is flaming with embarrassment. I quickly try to back away, but the mass of people pressing behind me is too heavy, so I\u2019m stuck, staring mutely up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhen Sam\u2019s in the room, you know things will reach resolution,\u201d the blond woman is saying. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the resolution you want ... eh, Charles?\u201d There\u2019s a roar of laughter around the room, and I hastily join in with fake gusto. Clearly this is a massive in-joke, which I would know about if I weren\u2019t a gate-crasher.</p><p>The guy next to me turns and exclaims, \u201cShe\u2019s a bit near the knuckle there!\u201d and I find myself replying, \u201cI know, I know!\u201d and giving another huge phony laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings me to another key player ... \u201d</p> <p>As I lift my eyes, Sam is looking nowhere near me, thank God. This is excruciating enough as it is.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for Jessica Garnett!\u201d</p><p>As a girl in red steps onto the podium, Sam takes his phone out of his pocket and unobtrusively taps at it. A moment later a text bleeps in my phone.</p><p>Why were you laughing?</p><p>I feel a stab of mortification. He must know I was just trying to blend in. He\u2019s deliberately winding me up. Well, I\u2019m not going to rise.</p><p>It was a good joke.</p><p>I watch as Sam checks his phone again. His face twitches only the tiniest bit, but I know he got it. He types again briefly\u2014then a moment later my phone bleeps again.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know your name was on my invitation.</p> <p>I glance up in trepidation, trying to gauge his expression, but again he\u2019s looking in the other direction, his face impassive. I think for a moment, then type:</p><p>Just stopped by to collect your goody bag for you. All part of the service. No need to thank me.</p><p>And my cocktails, I see.</p><p>Now he\u2019s looking right at my cosmo. He raises his eyebrows and I suppress an urge to giggle.</p><p>I was going to put them in a hip flask for you. Obviously.</p><p>Obviously. Although mine\u2019s a Manhattan.</p><p>Ah, well, now I know. I\u2019ll chuck all those tequila shots I had saved up.</p><p>As he clocks this last message, Sam looks up from his phone and flashes me that sudden smile. Without meaning to, I find myself beaming back and even catch my breath a little. It really does something to me, that smile of his. It\u2019s disconcerting. It\u2019s ...</p><p>Anyway. Concentrate on the speech.</p><p>\u201c ... and, finally, have a great night tonight! Thanks, everyone!\u201d</p><p>As a final round of applause breaks out, I try to find an escape route, but there isn\u2019t one. Within approximately ten seconds, Sam has stepped straight down off the podium and is standing in front of me.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I try to hide my discomfiture. \u201cEr ... hi.

You should have told me you wanted to come. I would have put you on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The wind is taken out of my sails. \u201cWell ... thanks. I\u2019m having a really nice time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiles and takes a glass of red wine from a passing waiter\u2019s tray. \u201cYou know what?\u201d He pauses thoughtfully, cradling his glass in his hands. \u201cI have something to say, Poppy Wyatt. I should have said it before. And that\u2019s thank you. You\u2019ve been a great help to me, these past few days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, really. No problem.\u201d I hurriedly make a brushing-off motion, but he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, listen, I want to say this. I know originally I was doing you the favor\u2014but in the end you\u2019ve done me one. I haven\u2019t had any proper PA support at work. You\u2019ve done a great job, keeping me up-to-date with everything. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d I say, feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cTake the credit!\u201d He laughs, then shrugs off his jacket and loosens his tie. \u201cJesus, it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d He slings his jacket over his shoulder and takes a gulp of wine. \u201cSo, nothing up today? The airwaves have gone very quiet.\u201d He gives another of those devastating little smiles. \u201cOr are all my emails coming through to Jane now?\u201d</p><p>My phone contains two hundred and forty-three emails for him. And they\u2019re still coming in.</p> <p>\u201cWell ... \u201d I take a gulp of cosmo, desperately playing for time. \u201cFunnily enough, you did get a few messages. I thought I wouldn\u2019t disturb you while you were in Germany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d He looks interested. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... this and that. Or would you rather wait till tomorrow?\u201d I clutch at a last hope.</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me now.\u201d</p><p>I rub my nose. Where do I start?</p><p>\u201cSam! There you are!\u201d A thin guy in glasses is approaching. He\u2019s blinking quite fast and holding a large black portfolio under his arms. \u201cthey said you weren\u2019t coming tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Sam says wryly.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Great!\u201d The thin guy is twitching with nervous energy. \u201cWell, I brought these along on the off chance.\u201d He thrusts the portfolio at Sam, who takes it, looking bemused. \u201cIf you have a moment tonight, I\u2019ll be staying up till two or three, always happy to Skype from home... . A bit radical, some of it, but ... Anyway! I think it\u2019s a great thing you\u2019re doing. And if there is a job opportunity behind all this ... count me in. Right. Well ... I won\u2019t keep you any longer. Thanks, Sam!\u201d He darts away again into the crowd.</p><p>For a moment neither of us speaks, Sam because he looks too baffled and me because I\u2019m trying to work out what to say.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d says Sam at last. \u201cDo you have any idea? Is there something I\u2019ve missed?\u201d</p><p>I lick my dry lips nervously. \u201cThere was something I meant to tell you about.\u201d I give a high-pitched laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s quite funny, actually, if you see it that way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d A large woman with a booming voice interrupts me. \u201c So delighted we\u2019ve got you signed up for the Fun Run!\u201d Oh my God. This must be Rachel.</p><p>\u201cFun Run?\u201d Sam echoes the words as though they\u2019re complete anathema to him. \u201cNo. Sorry, Rachel. I don\u2019t do Fun Runs. I\u2019m happy to donate, let other people do the running, good for them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your email!\u201d She stares at him. \u201cWe were so thrilled you wanted to take part! No one could believe it! This year we\u2019re all running in superhero costumes,\u201d she adds enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ve earmarked a Superman one for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEmail?\u201d Sam looks bewildered. \u201cWhat email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lovely email you sent! Friday, was it? Oh, and bless you for the e-card you sent young Chloe.\u201d Rachel lowers her voice and pats Sam on the hand. \u201cShe was so touched. Most directors wouldn\u2019t even care if an assistant\u2019s dog had died, so for you to send such a lovely e-card of condolence, with a poem and everything ... \u201d She opens her eyes wide. \u201cWell. We were all amazed, to be honest!\u201d</p><p>My face is getting hotter. I\u2019d forgotten about the e-card.</p><p>\u201cAn e-card of condolence for a dog,\u201d says Sam at last, in a strange voice. \u201cYes, I\u2019m pretty amazed at myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s staring straight at me.

Under my name ?\u201d</p><p>He looks so livid I actually back away, feeling a bit petrified.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cI thought it was a good idea.

I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I end lamely.</p><p>\u201cSam, I got your email!\u201d A girl with a ponytail interrupts us eagerly. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll see you at dance classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d Sam\u2019s eyes swivel in his head.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much for the support. Actually, you\u2019re my only pupil so far! Bring comfortable clothes and soft shoes, OK?\u201d</p><p>I glance at Sam and gulp at his expression. He seems literally unable to speak.

Thank God for a friendly face!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d Sam\u2019s demeanor instantly changes. His eyes light up and his icy expression seems to melt. \u201cGood to see you. I didn\u2019t know you were coming.\u201d</p><p>A man in his sixties, wearing a pin-striped suit over a groovy floral shirt, is raising a glass to us. I raise mine back, feeling awestruck. Sir Nicholas Murray! When I was Googling the company, I saw pictures of him with the prime minister, and Prince Charles, and everybody.</p><p>\u201cNever turn down a bash if I can help it,\u201d Sir Nicholas says cheerfully. \u201cMissed the speeches, have I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpot-on timing.\u201d Sam grins. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you sent your driver in to see if they were over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly comment.\u201d Sir Nicholas winks at him. \u201cDid you get my email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get mine ?\u201d counters Sam, and lowers his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve nominated Richard Doherty for this year\u2019s Dealmaker Award?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bright young talent, Sam,\u201d says Sir Nicholas, looking a little caught out. \u201cRemember his work with Hardwicks last year? He deserves recognition.\u201d</p><p>\u201c You put the Ryan Energy deal together. Not him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe helped,\u201d Sir Nicholas retorts. \u201cHe helped in many ways. Some of them ... intangible.\u201d</p><p>For a moment they stare at each other. They both look as though they\u2019re suppressing laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible,\u201d says Sam at last. \u201cI hope he\u2019s grateful. Now, you know I\u2019m just back from Germany? Few things we should discuss.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s totally frozen me out of the conversation, but I really don\u2019t mind. Really. In fact, maybe I\u2019ll just creep away while I have the chance.</p><p>\u201cSam, do introduce me to your friend,\u201d Sir Nicholas cuts into my thoughts, and I smile back nervously.</p><p>Sam obviously has no desire at all to introduce me to Sir Nicholas. But he\u2019s obviously also a polite man, because after about thirty seconds of what is clearly an internal struggle,69 he says, \u201cSir Nicholas, Poppy Wyatt. Poppy, Sir Nicholas Murray.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you do.\u201d I shake his hand, trying not to give away my excitement. Wow. Sir Nicholas Murray and me. Chatting at the Savoy. I\u2019m already thinking of ways I could casually drop this into conversation with Antony.</p><p>\u201cAre you at Johnson Ellison or Greene Retail?\u201d inquires Sir Nicholas politely.</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cActually, I\u2019m a physiotherapist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA physiotherapist!\u201d His face lights up. \u201cHow wonderful! The most underrated of all the medical arts, I always think. I\u2019ve been going to a super man in Harley Street for my back, although he hasn\u2019t quite cracked it... . \u201d He winces slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou want Ruby,\u201d I say, nodding wisely. \u201cMy boss. She\u2019s amazing. Her deep-tissue massage makes grown men weep. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sir Nicholas looks interested. \u201cDo you have a card?\u201d</p><p>Yessss! Ruby made us all cards when we first started out, and I have never been asked for mine before. Not once.</p><p>\u201cHere you are.\u201d I reach in my bag and produce a card nonchalantly, as though I do it all the time. \u201cWe\u2019re in Balham. It\u2019s south of the river; you may not know it... .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know Balham well.\u201d He twinkles at me. \u201cMy first flat in London was on Bedford Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d My canap\u00e9 nearly falls out of my mouth. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll definitely have to come and see us now.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. Sir Nicholas Murray, living on Bedford Hill. God, it shows. You start off in Balham and you end up knighted. It\u2019s quite inspiring, really.</p><p>\u201cSir Nicholas.\u201d The guy with olive skin has materialized from nowhere to join the group. \u201cDelighted to see you here. Always a pleasure. How are things going at Number Ten? Found the secret to happiness yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wheels turn.\u201d Sir Nicholas gives him an easy smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s an honor. Absolute honor. And Sam.\u201d The olive-skinned guy claps him on the back. \u201cMy main man. Couldn\u2019t do what we do without you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him indignantly. He was calling Sam a \u201cstubborn fuck\u2019 a moment ago.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Justin.\u201d Sam smiles tightly.</p><p>It is Justin Cole. I was right. He looks as sneery in real life as he does in his emails.</p><p>I\u2019m about to ask Sir Nicholas what the prime minister\u2019s really like, when a young guy approaches us nervously.</p><p>\u201cSam! Sorry to interrupt. I\u2019m Matt Mitchell. Thanks so much for volunteering.

The exchange program!\u201d Matt Mitchell is glowing. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited that you want to sign up!\u201d</p><p>My stomach flips over. Guatemala. I\u2019d totally forgotten about Guatemala.</p> <p>\u201cGuatemala?\u201d echoes Sam, with a kind of rictus smile on his face.</p><p>Now I remember. I sent that email quite late at night. I think I\u2019d had a glass of wine or two. Or ... three.</p><p>I risk a tiny peek at Sam, and his expression is so thunderous, I want to slink away. But the thing is, it sounded like an amazing opportunity. And from what I\u2019ve seen of his schedule, he never takes a holiday. He should go to Guatemala.</p><p>\u201cWe were all really touched by your email, Sam.\u201d Matt grasps Sam\u2019s hand earnestly with both of his. \u201cI never knew you felt that way about the developing world. How many orphans do you sponsor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam! Oh my God!\u201d A dark-haired girl, quite drunk, lurches up to the group and elbows Matt out of the way, making him drop Sam\u2019s hand. She\u2019s looking highly flushed and her mascara is smudged, and she grabs Sam\u2019s hand herself. \u201cThank you so much for your e-card about Scamper. You made my day, you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right, Chloe,\u201d Sam says tightly. He darts an incandescent glance of fury at me, and I flinch.</p><p>\u201cThose beautiful things you wrote,\u201d she gulps. \u201cI knew when I read them you must have lost a dog yourself. Because you understand, don\u2019t you? You understand. \u201d A tear rolls down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cChloe, do you want to sit down?\u201d says Sam, extricating his hand, but Justin cuts in, a malicious grin at his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about this famous e-card. Could I see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a printout.\u201d Wiping her nose, Chloe drags a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket, and Justin immediately grabs it.</p><p>\u201cOh, now, this is beautiful, Sam,\u201d he says, scanning it with mock admiration. \u201cVery moving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve shown everybody in the department.\u201d Chloe nods tearfully. \u201cThey all think you\u2019re amazing, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s hand is clenching his glass so hard, it\u2019s turning white. He looks like he wants to press an ejector button and escape. I\u2019m feeling really, really bad now. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d sent quite so many emails. I\u2019d forgotten about Guatemala. And I shouldn\u2019t have sent the e-card. If I could go back in time, that\u2019s the moment I\u2019d go up to myself and say, \u201cPoppy! Stop! No e-card!\u201d</p><p>\u201c Young Scamper\u2019s joined his friends in heaven, but we are left to weep, \u201d Justin reads aloud in a stagy voice. \u201c His furry fur, his eyes so bright, his bone upon the seat. \u201d Justin pauses. \u201cNot sure seat exactly rhymes with weep, Sam. And why is his bone on the seat, anyway? Hardly hygienic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive that here.\u201d Sam makes a swipe for it, but Justin dodges, looking delighted.</p><p>\u201c His blanket empty in his bed, the silence in the air. If Scamper now is looking down, he\u2019ll know how much we cared. \u201d Justin winces. \u201c Air? Cared? Do you know what a rhyme is, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very touching,\u201d says Sir Nicholas cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cI think it\u2019s brilliant.70\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so true.\u201d Tears are streaming down Chloe\u2019s face. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful because it\u2019s true. \u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s absolutely plastered. She\u2019s completely fallen out of one of her stilettos and doesn\u2019t even seem to have noticed.</p><p>\u201cJustin,\u201d says Sir Nicholas kindly. \u201cMaybe you could get Chloe a glass of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Justin deftly pockets the sheet. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I keep this poem of yours, do you, Sam? It\u2019s just so special. Have you ever thought of working for Hallmark?\u201d He escorts Chloe away and practically dumps her on a chair. A moment later I see him gleefully beckoning to the group he was with earlier and pulling the paper out of his pocket.</p><p>I almost don\u2019t dare look at Sam, I feel so guilty.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d says Sir Nicholas, looking amused. \u201cSam, I had no idea you were such an animal lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Sam seems barely able to operate his voice. \u201cI ... \u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying frantically to think of something I can say to redeem the situation. But what can I do?</p><p>\u201cNow, Poppy, please do excuse me.\u201d Sir Nicholas cuts into my thoughts. \u201cMuch as I would prefer to stay here, I must go over and talk to that interminably boring man from Greene Retail.\u201d He makes such a comical face at me, I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cSam, we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d He presses my hand in his and heads off into the crowd, and I quell an urge to run away with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo!\u201d I turn back to Sam and swallow several times. \u201cUm ... sorry about all that.\u201d</p><p>Sam says nothing, just holds out his hand, palm up.

I\u2019ve got all my contacts on it now, all my messages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t even been to the phone shop yet!

Not without causing a scene, which I\u2019m sensing is the last thing he wants to do.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re angry.\u201d I try to sound as grovelly as possible. \u201cI can understand that. But wouldn\u2019t you like me to forward all your emails on first? And give it back tomorrow when I\u2019ve tied up all the loose ends? Please?\u201d</p> <p>At least that\u2019ll give me a chance to make a note of some of my messages.</p><p>Sam is breathing hard through his nose. I can tell he\u2019s realizing he doesn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t send a single further email,\u201d he snaps at last, dropping his hand.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say humbly.</p><p>\u201cYou detail for me a list of the emails you did send.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hand the phone back tomorrow and that is the last I ever hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I come to the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He almost recoils at the idea. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet at lunchtime. I\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I heave a sigh, feeling quite downcast by now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to mess up your life.\u201d</p><p>I was half-hoping Sam might say something nice, like, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you didn\u2019t,\u201d or \u201cNever mind, you meant well.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t. He looks as merciless as ever.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I should know about?\u201d he asks curtly. \u201cBe honest, please. Any more foreign trips you\u2019ve signed me up to? Company initiatives you\u2019ve started in my name? Inappropriate poetry you\u2019ve written on my behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say nervously. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realize how much havoc you\u2019ve caused?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d I gulp.</p><p>\u201cYou realize how many embarrassing situations you\u2019ve put me in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to embarrass you. I didn\u2019t mean to create trouble. I thought I was doing you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA favor?\u201d He stares at me incredulously. \u201cA favor ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam.\u201d A breathy voice interrupts us, and I get a waft of perfume. I turn to see a girl in her late twenties, wearing skyscraper heels and lots of makeup. Her red hair is tonged into curls and her dress is really low-cut. I mean, I can practically see her navel. \u201cExcuse me, could I have a quick moment with Sam?\u201d She shoots me an antagonistic glance.</p><p>\u201cOh! Er ... sure.\u201d I move away a few steps, but not so far that I can\u2019t just about hear them.</p><p>\u201cSo. Can\u2019t wait to see you tomorrow.\u201d She\u2019s gazing up at Sam and batting her false eyelashes.71 \u201cIn your office. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Sam looks perplexed. \u201cDo we have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way you want to play it?\u201d She gives a soft, sexy laugh and swooshes her hair, like actresses do on those American TV drama series set in beautiful kitchens. \u201cI can play it any way you like.\u201d She lowers her voice to a throaty whisper. \u201cIf you know what I mean, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lindsay ... \u201d Sam frowns, obviously at a loss.</p><p>Lindsay? I nearly spill my drink down my dress. This girl is Lindsay?</p><p>Oh no. Oh no, oh no. This isn\u2019t good. I knew I should have canceled out Sam\u2019s kisses. I knew that winky face meant something. I\u2019m almost hopping with alarm. Can I warn Sam? Should I somehow semaphore to him?</p><p>\u201cI knew,\u201d she\u2019s murmuring now. \u201cThe first time I saw you, Sam, I knew there was a special vibe between us. You\u2019re hot. \u201d</p><p>Sam looks disconcerted. \u201cWell ... thanks, I guess. But, Lindsay, this really isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I can be very discreet.\u201d She runs a lacquered nail gently down his shirt. \u201cI\u2019d almost given up on you, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Sam takes a step backward, looking alarmed. \u201cLindsay \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this time, no signs\u2014then out of the blue you start contacting me.\u201d She opens her eyes wide. \u201cWishing me happy birthday, complimenting my work\u2014I knew what that was really about. And then tonight ... \u201d Lindsay moves close to Sam, speaking even more breathily. \u201cYou have no idea what it did to me, seeing your email. Mmmm. Bad boy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEmail?\u201d echoes Sam.

Why has nobody offered me a shot?</p><p>67 He claimed it was a typo. Yeah, I\u2019m sure his finger just happened to slip two spaces to the left.</p> <p>68 Doesn\u2019t everyone want to go to Iceland? Why would you say no to Iceland?</p><p>69 So not that polite.</p><p>70 OK, I know it\u2019s not brilliant. In my defense, I chose it in a hurry from some e-card site, and the picture was really good. It was a line drawing of an empty dog basket, and it nearly made me cry.</p><p>71 What is the etiquette when someone\u2019s false eyelash is coming off a bit at the edge? Tell them or politely ignore?</p><p>9</p> <p>I am the sorriest sorry person there ever was.</p><p>I really screwed up. I can see that now. I\u2019ve caused Sam a whole load of work and aggro and I\u2019ve abused his trust and been a complete pain in the neck.</p><p>Today was supposed to be a fun day. A weddingy day. I\u2019ve got a whole load of days booked off work for last-minute wedding preparation\u2014and what am I doing instead? Trying to think of all the different words for sorry that I can.</p><p>As I arrive for lunch, I\u2019m wearing a suitably penitent gray T-shirt and denim-skirt combo. We\u2019re meeting at a restaurant round the corner from his office, and the first thing I see when I walk in is a group of girls I remember from the Savoy last night, clustered at a circular table. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t recognize me, but I duck hurriedly past anyway.</p><p>Sam described this as \u201ca second office cafeteria\u2019 on the phone. Some cafeteria. There are steel tables and taupe linen-covered chairs and one of those cool menus where everything\u2019s in lowercase and each dish is described in the minimal amount of words.72 There aren\u2019t even any pound signs.73 No wonder Sam likes it.</p><p>I\u2019ve ordered some water and am trying to decide between soup and salad, when Sam appears at the door. Immediately, all the girls start waving him over, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he joins them. I can\u2019t hear all the conversation, but I catch the odd word: amazing idea ... excited ... so supportive. Everyone\u2019s smiling and looking positive, even Sam.</p> <p>Eventually he makes his excuses and heads over towards me.</p><p>\u201cHi. You made it.\u201d No smile for me, I notice.</p><p>\u201cYes. Nice restaurant. Thanks for meeting me. I really appreciate it.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be as mollifying as possible.</p><p>\u201cI practically live here.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cEveryone at WGC does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... here\u2019s a list of all the emails I sent in your name.\u201d I want to get this over straightaway. As I hand the sheet over, I can\u2019t help wincing. It looks such a lot, written down. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve forwarded everything.\u201d</p><p>A waiter interrupts me with a jug of water and a \u201cWelcome back, sir,\u201d to Sam, and then beckons over a waitress with the bread basket. As they leave, Sam folds my sheet and pockets it without comment. Thank God. I thought he was going to go through it item by item, like a headmaster.</p><p>\u201cThose girls are from your company, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I nod at the circular table. \u201cWhat were they talking about?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause as Sam pours himself some water\u2014then he looks up. \u201cThey were talking about your project, as it happens.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him. \u201c My project? You mean my email about ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s gone down well in admin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I let myself bask in this thought for a moment. \u201cSo ... not everyone reacted badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone come up with any good ideas for the company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happens ... yes,\u201d he says grudgingly. \u201cSome interesting thoughts have emerged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! Great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough I still have several people convinced there\u2019s a conspiracy theory to sack everyone and one threatening legal action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I feel chastened. \u201cRight. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d A cheerful girl in a green apron approaches. \u201cMay I explain the menu?74 We have a butternut squash soup today, made with an organic chicken stock ... \u201d</p><p>She goes through each item and, needless to say, I stop concentrating immediately. So by the end I have no idea what\u2019s available except butternut squash soup.</p><p>\u201cButternut squash soup, please.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cSteak baguette, rare, and a green salad. Thanks.\u201d I don\u2019t think Sam was listening either. He checks something on his phone and frowns, and I feel a pang of guilt. I must have increased his workload a ton with all this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just want to say, I\u2019m really, really sorry,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the e-card.

Sam is delighted to have received your email. He\u2019ll get back to you as soon as he possibly can. Meanwhile, thanks for your interest. Translation: Don\u2019t expect to hear from me anytime soon. \u201d He raises his eyebrows. \u201cYou must have a brush-off email. They come in pretty useful for fending off unwanted advances too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I say, a little offended. \u201cI never want to brush people off. I answer them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, that explains a lot. \u201d He tears off a chunk of bread and chews it. \u201cIf I\u2019d known that, I never would have agreed to share a phone.</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>I rummage in my bag, take the phone out, and put it on the table between us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that ?\u201d Sam exclaims, looking horrified.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I follow his gaze, puzzled, then realize. There were some diamant\u00e9 phone stickers in the Marie Curie goody bag, and I stuck them on the phone the other day.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I roll my eyes at his expression. \u201cThey come off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d better.\u201d He still seems stunned by the sight of it. Honestly. Doesn\u2019t anyone at his company bother to decorate their phone?</p> <p>Our food arrives, and for a while we\u2019re distracted with pepper mills and mustard and some side dish of parsnip chips which they seem to think we ordered.</p><p>\u201cYou in a hurry?\u201d inquires Sam as he\u2019s about to bite into his steak baguette.</p><p>\u201cNo. I took a few days off to do wedding stuff, but actually it turns out there\u2019s not a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>The truth is, I was a bit taken aback when I spoke to Lucinda this morning. I\u2019d told her ages ago that I was taking a few days off to help with the wedding. I\u2019d thought we could go and sort out some of the fun stuff together. But she basically said no, thanks. She had some long story about having to go see the florist in Northwood and needing to drop in at another client first and implied I\u2019d be in the way.75 So I\u2019ve had the morning off. I mean, I wasn\u2019t about to go to work for the sake of it.</p><p>As I sip my soup, I wait for Sam to volunteer some wedding talk of his own\u2014but he doesn\u2019t. Men just aren\u2019t into it, are they?</p><p>\u201cIs your soup cold?\u201d Sam suddenly focuses on my bowl. \u201cIf it\u2019s cold, send it back.\u201d</p><p>It is a bit less than piping hot\u2014but I really don\u2019t feel like making a fuss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, thanks.\u201d I flash him a smile and take another sip.</p> <p>The phone suddenly buzzes, and on reflex I pull it to me. It\u2019s Lucinda, telling me she\u2019s at the warehouse and could I please confirm that I want only four strands of gypsophila per bouquet?</p><p>I have no idea. Why would I specify something like that? What does four strands look like, anyway?</p><p>Yes, fine. Thanks so much, Lucinda, I really appreciate it! Not long now!!! Love, Poppy xxxxx</p><p>There\u2019s a new email from Willow too, but I can\u2019t bring myself to read it in front of Sam. I forward it quickly and put the phone down.</p><p>\u201cThere was a message from Willow just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d He nods with an off-putting frown.</p><p>I\u2019m dying to find out more about her. But how do I start without sounding unnatural?</p><p>I can\u2019t even ask, \u201cHow did you meet?\u201d because I already know, from one of her email rants. They met at her job interview for White Globe Consulting. Sam was on the panel, and he asked her some tricky question about her CV and she should have known THEN that he was going to fuck her life up. She should have stood up and WALKED AWAY. Because does he think a six-figure salary is what her life is about? Does he think everyone\u2019s like him? Doesn\u2019t he realize that to build a life together you have to KNOW WHAT THE BUILDING BLOCKS ARE, Sam????</p><p>Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I have honestly given up reading to the end.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you got yourself a new phone yet?\u201d says Sam, raising his eyebrows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the shop this afternoon.\u201d It\u2019ll be a real hassle, starting afresh with a new phone, but there\u2019s not much I can do about it. Except ...</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I was wondering,\u201d I add casually. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sell it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA company phone, full of business emails?\u201d He gives an incredulous laugh. \u201cAre you nuts? I was mad letting you have access to it in the first place. Not that I had a choice, Ms. Light-fingers. I should have set the police on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a thief!\u201d I retort, stung. \u201cI didn\u2019t steal it. I found it in a bin. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should have handed it in.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cYou know it and I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was common property! It was fair game!\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Fair game\u2019? You want to tell that to the judge? If I drop my wallet and it falls momentarily into a bin, does that give Joe Bloggs the right to steal it?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s winding me up or not, so I take a drink of water, avoiding the issue. I\u2019m turning the phone around and around in my hand, not wanting to relinquish it. I\u2019ve got used to this phone now. I like the feel of it. I\u2019ve even got used to sharing my in-box.</p><p>\u201cSo, what will happen to it?\u201d At last I look up. \u201cThe phone, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJane will forward everything of any relevance to her account. Then it\u2019ll get wiped. Inside and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d</p><p>The idea of all my messages being wiped makes me want to whimper. But there\u2019s nothing I can do. This was the deal. It was only a loan. Like he said, it\u2019s not my phone.</p><p>I put it down again, about two inches from my bowl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know my new number as soon as I get it,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I get any texts or messages\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll forward them.\u201d He nods. \u201cOr, rather, my new PA will do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen does she start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I smile a little wanly and take a sip of my soup, which really is the wrong side of tepid.</p><p>\u201cShe is great,\u201d he says with enthusiasm. \u201cHer name is Lizzy; she\u2019s very bright.\u201d He starts to attack his green salad. \u201cNow. While we\u2019re here, you have to tell me. What was the deal with Lindsay? What the hell did you write to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That.\u201d I feel warm with embarrassment. \u201cI think she misunderstood the situation because ... Well. It was nothing, really. I just complimented her and then I put some kisses from you. At the end of an email.\u201d</p><p>Sam puts his fork down. \u201cYou added kisses to an email of mine ? A business email?\u201d He looks almost more scandalized by this than by anything else.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cThey just slipped out. I always put kisses on emails. It\u2019s friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d He raises his eyes to heaven. \u201cYou\u2019re one of those ridiculous people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not ridiculous,\u201d I retort. \u201cIt\u2019s being nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d He reaches for the phone.</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cWhat are you doing ?\u201d</p><p>I make a swipe, but it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s got the phone and he\u2019s scrolling through all the messages and emails. As he reads, he lifts an eyebrow, then frowns, then gives a sudden laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d I try to sound frosty. \u201cYou should respect my confidentiality.\u201d</p><p>He totally ignores me. Does he have no idea of privacy? What\u2019s he reading, anyway? It could be anything.</p><p>I take another sip of soup, but it\u2019s so cold I can\u2019t face any more. As I look up, Sam\u2019s still reading my messages avidly. This is hideous. I feel like he\u2019s rifling through my underwear drawer.</p><p>\u201cNow you know what it\u2019s like, having someone else critiquing your emails,\u201d he says, glancing up.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to critique,\u201d I say, a little haughtily. \u201cUnlike you, I\u2019m charming and polite and don\u2019t brush people off with two words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call it charming. I call it something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I roll my eyes. Of course he doesn\u2019t want to admit I have superior communication skills.</p><p>Sam reads another email, shaking his head, then looks up and surveys me silently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, nettled. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so scared people will hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him, not knowing how to react. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He gestures at the phone. \u201cYour emails are like one big cry.

Love, Poppy xxxxxxxxxx Who\u2019s Sue? Your oldest, dearest friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the receptionist at my hairdresser.\u201d I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cSo she gets thanks and appreciation and a zillion kisses, just for doing her job?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m being nice !\u201d I snap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not being nice,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cit\u2019s being ridiculous. It\u2019s a business transaction. Be businesslike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my hairdresser!\u201d I say furiously. I take a spoonful of soup, forgetting how revolting it is, and quell a shudder.</p><p>Sam\u2019s still scrolling through my messages, as if he has every right to. I never should have let him get his hands on that phone. I should have wiped it myself.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Lucinda?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy wedding planner,\u201d I answer reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Isn\u2019t she supposed to be working for you ? What is all this shit she\u2019s laying on you?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too flustered to reply. I butter myself a piece of baguette, then put it down without eating it.</p><p>\u201cShe is working for me,\u201d I say at last, avoiding his eye. \u201cI mean, obviously I help out a little when she needs it... . \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done the cars for her.\u201d He\u2019s counting off on his fingers incredulously. \u201cYou\u2019ve organized the confetti, the buttonholes, the organist ... \u201d</p><p>I can feel a flush creeping over my face. I know I\u2019ve ended up doing more for Lucinda than I intended. But I\u2019m not going to admit that to him.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to! It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her tone\u2019s pretty bossy, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only her manner. I don\u2019t mind... . \u201d I\u2019m trying to throw him off this path, but he\u2019s relentless.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell her straight, \u2018You\u2019re working for me, cut out the attitude\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that, OK?\u201d I feel on the back foot. \u201cShe\u2019s not simply a wedding planner. She\u2019s an old friend of the Tavishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Tavishes?\u201d He shakes his head as though the name means nothing to him.</p><p>\u201cMy future in-laws! The Tavishes. Professor Antony Tavish? Professor Wanda Brook-Tavish? Their parents are great friends and Lucinda\u2019s part of that whole world, and she\u2019s one of them and I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I break off and rub my nose. I\u2019m not sure where I was going with that.</p><p>Sam picks up a spoon, leans over, takes a sip of my soup, and winces.</p> <p>\u201cFreezing. Thought so. Send it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really.\u201d I flash him an automatic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Send it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Look\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not hungry anyway.\u201d</p><p>Sam is gazing at me, shaking his head. \u201cYou are a big surprise, you know that? This is a big surprise.\u201d He taps the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2019</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty insecure for someone who\u2019s so feisty on the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d I retort, rattled.</p><p>\u201cNot insecure? Or not feisty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I\u2019m too confused to answer. \u201cI dunno. Stop it. Leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk about the Tavishes as if they\u2019re God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I do! They\u2019re in a different league \u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m cut off midstream by a man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cSam! My main man!\u201d It\u2019s Justin, clapping Sam on the back. He\u2019s wearing a black suit, black tie, and dark glasses. He looks like one of the Men in Black. \u201cSteak baguette again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me too well.\u201d Sam gets to his feet and taps a passing waiter. \u201cExcuse me, could we have a fresh soup for my guest? This one\u2019s cold. Did you meet Poppy the other night? Poppy, Justin Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnchant\u00e9.\u201d Justin nods at me, and I catch a waft of Fahrenheit aftershave.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I manage to smile politely, but I still feel stirred up inside. I need to tell Sam how wrong he is. About everything.</p><p>\u201cHow was the meeting with P&amp;G?\u201d Sam\u2019s saying to Justin.</p><p>\u201cGood! Very good! Although of course they miss you on the team, Sam.\u201d He makes a reproving gesture with his finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know this man is the star of our company?\u201d Justin says to me, gesturing at Sam. \u201cSir Nicholas\u2019s heir apparent. \u2018One day, dear boy, all this will be yours.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s just bullshit,\u201d Sam says pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a beat of silence. They\u2019re smiling at each other\u2014but it\u2019s a bit more like animals baring teeth.</p> <p>\u201cSo, I\u2019ll see you around,\u201d says Justin at length. \u201cGoing to the conference tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, in fact,\u201d Sam replies. \u201cLot of stuff to catch up on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Well, we\u2019ll toast you tonight.\u201d Justin raises his hand at me, then walks away.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d says Sam to me. \u201cThis restaurant is just impossible at lunchtime. But it\u2019s the closest that\u2019s any good.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been distracted from my churning thoughts by Justin Cole. He really is a prick.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I heard Justin talking about you last night,\u201d I say in a low voice, and lean across the table. \u201cHe called you a stubborn fuck.\u201d</p><p>Sam throws back his head and roars with laughter. \u201cI expect he did.\u201d</p><p>A fresh bowl of butternut squash soup arrives in front of me, steaming hot, and suddenly I feel ravenous.</p><p>\u201cThanks for doing that,\u201d I say awkwardly to Sam.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He tilts his head. \u201cBon app\u00e9tit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why did he call you a stubborn fuck?\u201d I take a spoonful of soup.</p> <p>\u201cOh, we disagree pretty fundamentally about how to run the company,\u201d he says carelessly. \u201cMy camp had a recent victory, so his camp is feeling sore.\u201d</p><p>Camps? Victories? Are they all permanently at war?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>God, this soup is good. I\u2019m ladling it down as though I haven\u2019t eaten for weeks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really interested?\u201d He appears to be amused.</p><p>\u201cYes! Of course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA member of personnel left the company. For the better, in my opinion. But not in Justin\u2019s.\u201d He takes a bite of baguette and reaches for his water.</p><p>That\u2019s it ? That\u2019s all he\u2019s going to tell me? A member of personnel left the company?</p> <p>\u201cYou mean John Gregson?\u201d I suddenly remember my Google search.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks taken aback. \u201cHow do you know about John Gregson?\u201d</p><p>\u201c Daily Mail online, of course.\u201d I roll my eyes. What does he think, that he works in a secret, private bubble?</p><p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d Sam seems to digest this. \u201cWell ... no. That was something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was this one, then? C\u2019mon,\u201d I wheedle as he hesitates. \u201cYou can tell me. I\u2019m best friends with Sir Nicholas Murray, you know. We have drinks at the Savoy together. We\u2019re like this.\u201d I cross my fingers, and Sam gives a reluctant snort of laughter.</p><p>\u201cOK. I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s any great secret.\u201d He hesitates and lowers his voice. \u201cIt was a guy called Ed Exton. Finance director. The truth is, he was fired. Turned out he\u2019d been defrauding the company for a while. Nick wouldn\u2019t press charges, but that was a big mistake. Now Ed\u2019s suing for wrongful dismissal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I nearly squeak. \u201cI knew it! And that\u2019s why he was worse for wear in the Groucho.\u201d</p><p>Sam gives a short, incredulous laugh. \u201cYou know about that. Of course you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ... Justin was angry when Ed was fired?\u201d I\u2019m trying to get this clear.</p><p>\u201cJustin was gunning for Ed to take over as CEO, with himself as right-hand man,\u201d says Sam wryly. \u201cSo, yes, you could say he was fairly angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCEO?\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cBut ... what about Sir Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they would have ousted Nick if they\u2019d got enough support,\u201d says Sam matter-of-factly. \u201cThere\u2019s a faction in this company that\u2019s more interested in creaming off short term profits and dressing in Paul Smith than anything else. Nick\u2019s all about playing the long game. Not always the most popular position.\u201d</p><p>I finish my soup, digesting all this. Honestly, these office politics are all so complicated. How does anyone get any work done? It\u2019s bad enough when Annalise has one of her hissy fits about whose turn it is to buy the coffee and we all get distracted and forget to write up our reports.</p><p>If I worked at White Globe Consulting, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job.

He was an orphan. Brought up in a children\u2019s home. Everything he\u2019s got, he\u2019s worked his socks off for. Not a snobbish bone in his body. Not like some of these pretentious tossers trying to get rid of him.\u201d He scowls and stuffs a bundle of rocket into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFabian Taylor must be in Justin\u2019s camp,\u201d I observe thoughtfully. \u201cHe\u2019s so sarcastic with you. I always wondered why.\u201d I look up to see Sam regarding me with a lowered, furrowed brow.</p> <p>\u201cPoppy, be honest. How many of my emails have you read?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s asking that.</p><p>\u201cAll of them, of course. What did you think?\u201d His expression is so funny, I get the giggles. \u201cThe minute I got my hands on that phone, I started snooping on you. Emails from colleagues, emails from Willow ... \u201d I can\u2019t resist throwing out the name casually to see if he bites.</p><p>Sure enough, he blanks the reference completely. It\u2019s as though the name Willow means nothing to him.</p><p>But this is our farewell lunch. It\u2019s my last chance. I\u2019m going to perservere.</p> <p>\u201cSo, does Willow work on a different floor from you?\u201d I say conversationally.</p><p>\u201cSame floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. And ... you two met through work?\u201d</p><p>He just nods. This is like getting blood out of a stone.</p><p>A waiter comes to clear my bowl and we order coffees. As the waiter moves away, I see Sam studying me thoughtfully. I\u2019m about to ask another question about Willow, but he gets in first.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, slight change of subject. Can I say something to you? As a friend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre we friends?\u201d I reply dubiously.</p><p>\u201cA disinterested spectator, then.\u201d</p><p>Great. First of all, he\u2019s dodging the Willow conversation. Secondly, what now? A speech on why you shouldn\u2019t steal phones? Another lecture on being businesslike in emails?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I can\u2019t help rolling my eyes. \u201cFire away.\u201d</p><p>He picks up a teaspoon, as though marshaling his thoughts, then puts it down.</p><p>\u201cI know this is none of my business. I haven\u2019t been married. I haven\u2019t met your fianc\u00e9. I don\u2019t know the situation.\u201d</p><p>As he speaks, blood creeps into my face. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t. So\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He presses on without listening to me.</p><p>\u201cBut it seems to me you can\u2019t\u2014you shouldn\u2019t \u2014go into a marriage feeling inferior in any way.\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m too stunned to respond. I\u2019m groping for reactions. Shout? Slap him? Stalk out?</p><p>\u201cOK, listen,\u201d I manage at last. My throat is tight, but I\u2019m trying to sound poised. \u201cFirst of all, you don\u2019t know me, like you said. Second of all, I don\u2019t feel inferior\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do. It\u2019s obvious from everything you say. And it\u2019s baffling to me. Look at you. You\u2019re a professional. You\u2019re successful. You\u2019re ... \u201d He hesitates. \u201cYou\u2019re attractive. Why should you feel the Tavishes are in a \u2018different league\u2019 from you?\u201d</p><p>Is he being deliberately obtuse?</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re, like, major famous people! They\u2019re all geniuses and they\u2019ll all end up being knighted, and my uncle\u2019s just a normal dentist from Taunton\u2014\u201d I break off, breathing hard.</p><p>Great. Now I\u2019ve walked straight into it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d</p><p>Here goes. He asked for it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d I say bluntly. \u201cBoth my parents are dead. Car crash ten years ago.\u201d I lean back in my chair, waiting for the awkward pause.</p><p>It can go so many different ways. Silence. Hand over mouth. Gasp.76 Exclamation. Awkward change of subject. Morbid curiosity. Story about bigger, more gruesome crash that friend of friend\u2019s aunt was in.</p><p>One girl I told actually burst into tears right then and there. I had to watch her sobbing and find her a tissue.</p><p>But ... it\u2019s weird. This time doesn\u2019t seem to be awkward. Sam hasn\u2019t looked away. He hasn\u2019t cleared his throat or gasped or changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cBoth at once?\u201d he says at last, in a more gentle voice.</p><p>\u201cMy mother straightaway. My father the day after.\u201d I flash him a brittle smile. \u201cNever got to say goodbye to him, though.

I stir my cappuccino, a little too fast, and take a gulp.</p><p>\u201cThat explains a lot,\u201d says Sam at last.</p><p>I can\u2019t bear his sympathy. I can\u2019t bear anyone\u2019s sympathy.</p><p>\u201cIt does not,\u201d I say tightly. \u201cIt does not. It happened years ago and it\u2019s over and I\u2019m a grown-up and I\u2019ve dealt with it, OK? So you\u2019re wrong.

Shall we get the bill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He summons a waiter, and I take out my lip gloss, and after about two minutes I feel back to normal.</p><p>I try to pay for lunch, but Sam point-blank refuses, so we compromise on going Dutch. After the waiter\u2019s taken our money and wiped away the crumbs, I look at him across the empty table.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Slowly, I slide the phone across the table to him. \u201cHere you are. Thanks. Nice knowing you and everything.\u201d</p><p>Sam doesn\u2019t even look at it. He\u2019s gazing at me with the sort of kind, concerned expression that makes me prickle all over and want to throw things. If he says anything more about my parents, I\u2019ll just walk. I\u2019ll go.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering,\u201d he says at last. \u201cOut of interest, have you ever learned any methods of confrontation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh out loud with surprise. \u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t want to confront anybody.\u201d</p><p>Sam spreads his hands. \u201cThere you go. There\u2019s your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem! You\u2019re the one with a problem. At least I\u2019m nice, \u201d I can\u2019t help saying pointedly. \u201cYou\u2019re ... miserable.\u201d</p><p>Sam roars with laughter, and I flush. OK, maybe miserable was the wrong word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I reach for my bag. \u201cI don\u2019t need any help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. Don\u2019t be a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a coward!\u201d I retort in outrage.</p><p>\u201cIf you can give it out, you can take it,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cWhen you read my texts, you saw a curt, miserable git. And you told me so. Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut you know what I saw when I read yours?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I scowl at him. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a girl who races to help others but doesn\u2019t help herself.

Remember: am HYPOCHONDRIAC.</p><p>5. Beef stroganoff. Get to like. (Hypnosis?)</p><p>I feel drenched in embarrassment. This is why people shouldn\u2019t share phones.</p><p>\u201c\u2019It\u2019s nothing to do with you,\u201d I mutter, staring at the table.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he says gently. \u201cI also know that standing up for yourself can be hard. But you have to do it. You have to get it out there. Before the wedding.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent a minute or two. I can\u2019t bear him to be right. But deep down inside me, everything he\u2019s saying is feeling true. Like Tetris blocks falling one by one into place.</p> <p>I let my bag drop down onto the table and rub my nose. Sam patiently waits while I get my thoughts in order.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all very well you telling me that,\u201d I say finally. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well saying \u2018get it out there.\u2019 What am I supposed to say to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Them\u2019 being ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno. His parents, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly feel disloyal, talking about Magnus\u2019s family behind his back. But it\u2019s a bit late for that.</p><p>Sam doesn\u2019t hesitate for a minute.</p><p>\u201cYou say, \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Tavish, you\u2019re making me feel inferior. Do you really think I\u2019m inferior or is this just in my mind?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat planet do you live on?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cI can\u2019t say that! People don\u2019t say things like that!\u201d</p> <p>Sam laughs. \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m about to do this afternoon? I\u2019m about to tell an industry CEO that he doesn\u2019t work hard enough, that he\u2019s alienating his fellow board members, and that his personal hygiene is becoming a management issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I\u2019m cringing at the thought. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d says Sam calmly. \u201cI\u2019ll take him through, point by point, and by the end he\u2019ll be agreeing with me. It\u2019s just technique and confidence. Awkward conversations are kind of my specialism. I learned a lot from Nick,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe can tell people that their company is a pile of shit, and they lap out of his hand. Or even that their country is a pile of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I\u2019m a bit awestruck.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit in on the meeting. If you\u2019re not busy. There\u2019ll be a couple of other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s how you learn.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea you could be a specialist at awkward conversations. I\u2019m trying to picture myself telling someone that their personal hygiene is an issue. I can\u2019t imagine finding the words to do that in a million years.</p><p>Oh, come on. I have to see this.</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I find myself smiling. \u201cI will. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He hasn\u2019t picked up the phone, I suddenly notice. It\u2019s still lying on the table.</p><p>\u201cSo ... shall I bring this along to your office?\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He\u2019s shrugging on his jacket. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Excellent. I get to check my texts again. Result!</p><p>72 soup, duck, etc. Which I know looks all cool and streamlined, but what sort of soup? What sort of duck?</p><p>73 Isn\u2019t that illegal? What if I wanted to pay in dollars? Would they have to let me?</p><p>74 OK, this is ridiculous. You write a menu which no one understands and then you pay someone to explain it.</p><p>75 Why are all her suppliers in such odd places? Whenever I ask her, she talks vaguely about sourcing. Ruby reckons it\u2019s so she can charge more for driving hours.</p><p>76 Magnus was a gasper. Then he gripped me tight between both hands and said he\u2019d known I was vulnerable and that just added to my beauty.</p><p>10</p><p>It must be so amazing to work in a place like this. Everything about Sam\u2019s building is a novelty to me\u2014from the massive escalator to the whizzy lifts to the laminated card with my photo on it, which got made by a machine in about three seconds. When visitors come to First Fit Physio, we just sign them in with a book from Staples.</p><p>We go up to the sixteenth floor and along a corridor with a bright green carpet, black-and-white photos of London on the wall, and funky seating in random shapes. On the right are individual glass-fronted offices, and on the left is a big open-plan area with multicolored desks. Everything here is so cool. There\u2019s a water machine, like we have, but there\u2019s also a coffee station with a real Nespresso machine and a Smeg fridge and a massive bowl of fruit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I am so talking to Ruby about staff conditions at First Fit Physio.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d A man in a navy linen jacket greets Sam, and as they talk, I peer all around at the open-plan office area, wondering if I might spot Willow. That girl with wavy blond hair, talking into a headset, sitting with her feet up on a chair. Could that be her?</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Sam seems to be wrapping up the conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting, Nihal. I\u2019ll have a think.\u201d</p><p>Nihal. My ears prick up. I know that name from somewhere. I\u2019m sure I do. What was it, now? Nihal ... Nihal ...</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Sam,\u201d Nihal is saying. \u201cI\u2019ll just forward that document to you right now.... \u201d As he\u2019s tapping at his phone, I suddenly remember.</p><p>\u201cCongratulate him on his baby!\u201d I whisper to Sam. \u201cNihal\u2019s wife just had a baby last week. Yasmin. Seven pounds. She\u2019s gorgeous! Didn\u2019t you see the email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sam looks taken aback but recovers smoothly. \u201cHey, Nihal, congrats on the baby, by the way. Fantastic news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYasmin\u2019s a lovely name.\u201d I beam at Nihal. \u201cAnd seven pounds! What a good size! How is she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Anita?\u201d joins in Sam.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both very well, thanks! I\u2019m sorry ... I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve met?\u201d Nihal glances at Sam for help.</p><p>\u201cThis is Poppy,\u201d says Sam. \u201cShe\u2019s here to do some ... consultation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Nihal shakes my hand, still looking puzzled. \u201cSo, how did you know about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Sam mentioned it to me,\u201d I lie smoothly. \u201cHe was so thrilled for you, he couldn\u2019t help telling me. Isn\u2019t that right, Sam?\u201d</p><p>Ha! Sam\u2019s face!</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he says finally. \u201cDelighted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d Nihal\u2019s face suffuses with pleasure. \u201cThanks, Sam. I didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d be so\u2014\u201d He breaks off awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Sam lifts a hand. \u201cCongratulations again. Poppy, we should really be getting on.\u201d</p><p>As Sam and I walk away down the office, I want to giggle at his expression.</p><p>\u201cCan you cut it out, please?\u201d Sam murmurs without moving his head. \u201cFirst animals, now babies. What kind of reputation are you going to give me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good one!\u201d I retort. \u201cEveryone will love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam.\u201d A voice hails us from behind, and we turn to see Matt Mitchell, glowing with delight. \u201cI just heard the news! Sir Nicholas is joining the Guatemala trip! That\u2019s awesome!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sam nods brusquely. \u201cWe spoke about it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wanted to thank you,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cI know this was your influence. You two guys will add so much heft to the cause. Oh, and thanks for the donation. We really appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>I stare in astonishment. Sam gave a donation to the Guatemala trip? He gave a donation ?</p><p>Now Matt is beaming at me. \u201cHello again. Are you interested in the Guatemala trip?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God, I would love to go to Guatemala.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Well\u2014\u201d I begin enthusiastically, before Sam cuts me off firmly:</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Honestly. What a spoilsport.</p><p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d I say politely. \u201cI hope it goes well!\u201d</p><p>As Matt Mitchell heads back down the corridor and we walk on, I\u2019m mulling hard on what I just heard.</p><p>\u201cYou never told me Sir Nicholas was going to Guatemala,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sam doesn\u2019t sound remotely interested. \u201cWell, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you gave them a donation,\u201d I add. \u201cSo you do think it\u2019s a good cause. You think it\u2019s worth supporting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave them a small donation.\u201d He corrects me with me a forbidding look, but I\u2019m undeterred.</p><p>\u201cSo actually ... that situation turned out really well. Not a disaster at all.\u201d I count off thoughtfully on my fingers. \u201cAnd the girls in admin think you\u2019re wonderful and the whole ideas initiative is brilliant. And you\u2019ve got some interesting new thoughts for the company. And Nihal thinks you\u2019re the bee\u2019s knees, and so does Chloe and all her department, and Rachel loves you for doing the Fun Run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere exactly are you going with this?\u201d Sam\u2019s expression is so ominous, I quail slightly.</p><p>\u201cEr ... nowhere!\u201d I backtrack. \u201cJust saying.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll keep quiet now, for a while.</p><p>After the lobby I was expecting to be impressed by Sam\u2019s office\u2014but I\u2019m more than impressed. I\u2019m awestruck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s a huge corner space, with windows overlooking Blackfriars Bridge, a designer light sculpture hanging from the ceiling, and a massive desk. There\u2019s another, smaller desk outside, which I guess is where Violet used to sit. By the window is a sofa, which is where Sam ushers me.</p><p>\u201cThe meeting\u2019s not for twenty minutes. I\u2019ve got to catch up with some stuff. Make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>I sit on the sofa quietly for a few minutes, but it\u2019s quite boring just sitting on a sofa. At last I get up and wander to the window, gazing down at all the little cars whizzing over the bridge. There\u2019s a bookshelf nearby with lots of business hardbacks and a few awards. No photo of Willow, though. Nor is there one on his desk. He must have a photo of her somewhere, surely?</p><p>As I\u2019m looking around for it, I notice another doorway and can\u2019t help peering at it curiously. Why does he have a door? Where does it lead to?</p> <p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d says Sam, spotting me. \u201cDo you want to use it? Go ahead.\u201d</p><p>Wow. He has an executive bathroom!</p><p>I head inside, hoping to find some amazing palace of marble\u2014but it\u2019s quite normal really, with a small shower and glass tiles. Still. Your own bathroom inside your office. That\u2019s pretty cool.</p><p>I take the opportunity to redo my makeup, brush my hair, and tug my denim skirt back into place. I open the door and am about to step outside when I realize there\u2019s a soup splash on my shirt. Shit.</p><p>Maybe I can get that off.</p> <p>I dampen a towel and give it a quick rub. No. Not wet enough. I\u2019ll have to lean down and get it right under the tap.</p><p>As I\u2019m bending down, I see a woman in a smart black trouser suit in the mirror, and I jump. It takes me a moment to realize I\u2019ve got a reflected view of the whole office, and she\u2019s actually approaching Sam\u2019s glass door. She\u2019s tall and imposing-looking, in her forties, maybe, and is holding a piece of paper.</p><p>Her expression is fairly grim. Ooh, maybe she\u2019s the CEO with bad personal hygiene.</p><p>No. Surely not. Look at that perfectly crisp white shirt.</p><p>Oh my God, is this Willow ?</p><p>I suddenly feel even more embarrassed about my soup stain. It hasn\u2019t come off at all; I\u2019ve just got a big wet patch on my T-shirt. In fact, I look hideous. Should I tell Sam I can\u2019t come to the meeting after all? Or maybe he has a spare shirt I could borrow. Don\u2019t businessmen always keep spare shirts at the office?</p> <p>No, Poppy. Don\u2019t be ridiculous. And, anyway, there\u2019s no time. The woman in the black suit is already rapping at his door and pushing it open. I watch in the mirror, on tenterhooks.</p><p>\u201cSam. I need a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What is it?\u201d He looks up and frowns at her expression. \u201cVicks, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Vicks! Of course this is Vicks, head of PR. I should have realized at once.</p><p>I feel I already know her from all her emails, and she\u2019s just as I imagined. Sharply cut sharp brunette hair, businesslike manner, sensible shoes, expensive watch. And right now a look of massive stress on her face.</p><p>\u201cOnly a handful of people know about this,\u201d she says as she closes the door. \u201cAn hour ago I had a call from a mate of mine at ITN. They\u2019ve got hold of an internal memo from Nick, which they\u2019re planning to splash across the ten o\u2019clock bulletin.\u201d She winces. \u201cIt\u2019s ... it\u2019s bad, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemo?\u201d He looks perplexed. \u201cWhat memo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA memo he apparently sent to you and Malcolm? Several months ago now? When you were doing that advisory work with BP? Here. Have a read.\u201d</p> <p>After about ten seconds, I peep round the side of the ajar bathroom door. I can see Sam reading a printed sheet, an expression of shock on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Vicks lifts her hands. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ... \u201d He seems speechless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Vicks says calmly. \u201cHe\u2019s basically talking about accepting bribes. Put that together with the fact he\u2019s on a government committee right now ... \u201d She hesitates. \u201cYou and Malcolm could be compromised too. We\u2019ll need to look at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... but I\u2019ve never seen this memo in my life!\u201d Sam finally has found his voice. \u201cNick didn\u2019t send this to me! He didn\u2019t write these things. He would never have written these things. I mean, he sent us a memo which began the same way, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I gather from Malcolm too. The memo he received wasn\u2019t word for word the same as this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot \u2018word for word\u2019?\u201d echoes Sam impatiently. \u201cIt was totally fucking different! Yes, it may have been about BP, yes, it may have raised the same issues, but it did not say these things.\u201d He hits the page. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the hell this has come from.

Nick must have saved it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re searching. Here and at his Berkshire office. So far, this is the only version they\u2019ve managed to find on the system.\u201d She taps the paper.</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d Sam gives an incredulous laugh. \u201cWait\u2014I have it myself!\u201d</p><p>He sits down and opens up a file. \u201cI would have put it ...\u201d He clicks a few more times. \u201cHere we are!

I had it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot there?\u201d Vicks\u2019s voice is tight with disappointment.</p><p>Sam is clicking frantically at his computer again.</p><p>\u201cThis makes no bloody sense,\u201d he\u2019s saying, almost to himself. \u201cThe memo was emailed over.

Do you still have that original version?\u201d I can see the hope in Vicks\u2019s eyes.</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sam exhales. \u201cI read it online. Malcolm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t print it out either. And he can only find this version on his system. OK.\u201d Vicks sags a little. \u201cWell ... we\u2019ll keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be there.\u201d Sam sounds adamant. \u201cIf the techies say they can\u2019t find it, they\u2019re wrong. Put more of them on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all searching. We haven\u2019t told them why, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if we can\u2019t find it, you\u2019ll just have to tell ITN it\u2019s a mystery to us,\u201d says Sam energetically. \u201cWe refute it. We make it crystal clear that this memo was never read by me, never written by Nick, has never been seen before by anyone in the company\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, it\u2019s on the company system.\u201d Vicks sounds weary. \u201cWe can hardly claim that no one in the company has ever seen it. Unless we can find the other memo\u2014\u201d Her phone bleeps with a text, and she glances at it. \u201cThat\u2019s Julian from legal. They\u2019re going to go for an injunction, but ... \u201d She gives a hopeless shrug. \u201cNow that Nick\u2019s a government adviser, there\u2019s not much chance.\u201d</p><p>Sam is peering at the sheet of paper again, a frown of distaste on his face.</p><p>\u201cWho wrote this crap?\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even sound like Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod knows.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m so rapt that when my phone buzzes I nearly expire in fright. I glance at the screen and feel another jolt of fright. I can\u2019t stay hiding here. I quickly press talk, and hurry out of the bathroom, my legs wobbly.</p><p>\u201cUm, sorry to disturb,\u201d I say awkwardly, and hold out the phone. \u201cSam, it\u2019s Sir Nicholas for you.\u201d</p><p>Vicks\u2019s expression of horror almost makes me want to laugh\u2014except she looks as though she wants to strangle someone. And that someone could be me.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she ?\u201d she snaps, eyeing the stain on my T-shirt. \u201cIs this your new PA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s ... \u201d Sam waves it off. \u201cLong story. Nick!\u201d he exclaims into the receiver. \u201cI\u2019ve just heard. Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear any of that?\u201d says Vicks to me in a savage undertone.</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, yes. A bit.\u201d I\u2019m gabbling in fright. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t listening. I didn\u2019t hear anything. I was brushing my hair. Really hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I\u2019ll be in touch. Keep us posted.\u201d Sam switches off the phone and shakes his head. \u201cWhen the hell will he learn to use the right number? Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Distractedly, he puts the phone down on the desk. \u201cThis is ridiculous. I\u2019m going to speak to the techies myself. If they can\u2019t find a lost email, for fuck\u2019s sake, they should all be fired. They should be fired anyway. They\u2019re useless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould it be on your phone?\u201d I suggest timidly.</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes light up for a moment\u2014then he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNo. This was months ago.

Does she have a pass ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I hurriedly produce my laminated card.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ... OK. She\u2019s a visitor. I\u2019ll deal with her. Come on.

I can hear a stream of low-pitched invective coming from her as they walk off.</p><p>\u201cSam, when exactly were you planning to tell me you had a fucking visitor in your bathroom, listening to our fucking confidential crisis ? You do realize my job is to control the flow of information? Control it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicks, relax.\u201d</p> <p>As they disappear from view, I sink down onto a chair, feeling a bit unreal. Yowzer. I have no idea what to do now. Should I stay? Should I go? Is the meeting with the CEO still going to happen?</p><p>I\u2019m not exactly in a hurry to go anywhere\u2014but after about twenty minutes of sitting there alone, I start to feel distinctly uncomfortable. I\u2019ve leafed through a magazine full of words I don\u2019t understand, and I\u2019ve thought about getting myself a coffee (and decided against it). The CEO meeting must surely be off. Sam must be tied up. I\u2019m gearing myself up to write him a note and leave, when a blond guy taps at the glass door. He looks about twenty-three and is holding a massive rolled-up piece of blue paper.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he says shyly. \u201cAre you Sam\u2019s new PA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just ... er ... helping him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, OK.\u201d He nods. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about the competition. The ideas competition?\u201d</p><p>Oh God. This again.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cDo you want to leave Sam a message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this to get to him. It\u2019s a visualization of the company? A restructuring exercise? It\u2019s self-explanatory, but I\u2019ve attached some notes.\u201d</p><p>He hands over the rolled-up paper, together with an exercise book full of writing.</p><p>I already know there is no way Sam is going to look at any of this. I feel quite sorry for this guy.</p><p>\u201cOK! Well ... I\u2019ll make sure he sees it. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>As the blond guy heads off, I unroll a corner of the paper out of curiosity\u2014and I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s a collage! Like I used to do when I was about five!</p><p>I spread the whole thing out flat on the floor, anchoring the corners with chair legs. It\u2019s in the design of a tree, with photos of staff stuck onto the branches. God only knows what it\u2019s supposed to say about the structure of the company\u2014I don\u2019t care. What\u2019s interesting for me is that under each photo is the person\u2019s name. Which means I can finally put faces to all the people who have sent an email through Sam\u2019s phone. This is riveting.</p><p>Jane Ellis is a lot younger than I expected, and Malcolm is fatter, and Chris Davies turns out to be a woman. There\u2019s Justin Cole ... and there\u2019s Lindsay Cooper ... and there\u2019s\u2014</p> <p>My finger stops dead.</p><p>Willow Harte.</p><p>She\u2019s nestling on a lower branch, smiling out cheerfully. Thin and dark-haired, with very arched black eyebrows. She\u2019s quite pretty, I grudgingly admit, although not supermodel standard.</p><p>And she works on the same floor as Sam. Which means ...</p><p>Oh, I\u2019ve got to. Come on. I\u2019ve got to have a quick peek at the psycho fianc\u00e9e before I go.</p><p>I head to Sam\u2019s glass door and peer cautiously out at the floor. I have no idea if she\u2019ll be in the open-plan area or have her own office. I\u2019ll just have to wander round. If anyone stops me, I\u2019ll be Sam\u2019s new PA.</p><p>I grab a couple of files as camouflage and cautiously venture out. A couple of people typing at their computers lift their heads and give me an uninterested glance. Skirting the edge of the floor, I glance through windows and peer at names on doors, trying to catch a glimpse of a girl with dark hair, listening out for a whiny, nasal voice. She has to have a whiny, nasal voice, surely. And lots of stupid, made-up allergies, and about ten therapists\u2014</p><p>I stop dead. That\u2019s her! It\u2019s Willow!</p><p>She\u2019s ten yards away. Sitting in one of the glass-doored offices. To be honest, I can\u2019t see much of her except her profile and a hank of long hair hanging down the back of her chair and some long legs ending in black ballet pumps\u2014but it\u2019s definitely her. I feel as though I\u2019ve stumbled on some mythological creature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I approach, I start to tingle all over. I have a dreadful feeling I might suddenly giggle. This is so ridiculous. Spying on someone I\u2019ve never met. I clutch my folders more tightly and edge forward a little more.</p><p>There are two other women in the office with her, and they\u2019re all drinking tea, and Willow is talking.</p><p>Damn. She doesn\u2019t have a whiny, nasal voice. In fact, it\u2019s quite melodious and sane-sounding\u2014except when you start listening to what she\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cOf course this is all to get back at me,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cThis whole exercise is one big Fuck You, Willow. You know it was actually my idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d says one of the girls. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d She turns her head briefly and I catch sight of a sorrowful, pitying smile. \u201cNew-idea generation is my thing. Sam ripped me off. I was planning to send out exactly the same email. Same words, everything. He probably saw it on my laptop one night.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m listening, completely stunned. Is she talking about my email? I want to burst in and say, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t have ripped you off; he didn\u2019t even send it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of move he pulls all the time,\u201d she adds, and takes a sip of tea. \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s made his career. No integrity.\u201d</p><p>OK, I\u2019m completely fogged now. Either I\u2019m all wrong about Sam or she\u2019s all wrong about him, because in my opinion he\u2019s the last person in the world you could imagine ripping somebody else off.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know why he has to compete with me,\u201d Willow\u2019s saying. \u201cWhat is that with men? What\u2019s wrong with facing the world together? Side by side? What\u2019s wrong with being a partnership? Or is that too ... generous for him to get his stupid male head round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants control,\u201d says of one the other girls, cracking a chocolate biscuit in half. \u201cThey all do. He\u2019s never going to give you the credit you deserve in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can\u2019t he see how perfect it would be if we could get it fucking right ? If we could get beyond this crappy bad patch?\u201d Willow sounds impassioned. \u201cWorking together, being together ... the whole package ... it could be sublime.\u201d She breaks off and takes a gulp of tea. \u201cThe question is, how long do I give him? Because I can\u2019t go on like this much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked it through?\u201d says the third girl.</p><p>\u201cPlease! You know Sam and \u2018talking.\u2019 \u201d She makes quote marks with her fingers.</p><p>Well. I\u2019m with her there.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me sad.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cNot for me, for him. He can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of his face and he doesn\u2019t know how to value what he has, and, you know what? He\u2019s going to lose it. And then he\u2019s going to want it, but it\u2019ll be too late. Too late.\u201d She bangs her teacup down. \u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m suddenly gripped. I\u2019m seeing this conversation in a new light. I\u2019m realizing that Willow has more insight than I gave her credit for. Because, if truth be told, this is just what I feel about Sam and his father. Sam can\u2019t see what he\u2019s losing, and when he does it may be too late. OK, I know I don\u2019t know the whole story between them. But I\u2019ve seen the emails, I\u2019ve got the idea\u2014</p><p>My thoughts stop abruptly in their tracks. Alarm bells have started to ring in my head. First distant, but now getting loud and clangy. Oh no, oh no, oh God.</p><p>Sam\u2019s father. April 24. That\u2019s today. I\u2019d completely forgotten. How could I be so stupid ?</p><p>Horror is rising up in me like chill water. Sam\u2019s dad\u2019s going to pitch up at the Chiddingford Hotel, expecting some lovely reunion. Today. He\u2019s probably on his way already. He\u2019ll be all excited. And Sam won\u2019t even be there. He\u2019s not going to the conference until tomorrow.</p><p>Shiiiiit. I\u2019ve really messed up. I\u2019d forgotten all about it, what with all the other emergencies going on.</p><p>What do I do? How do I solve this? I can\u2019t tell Sam. He\u2019ll go absolutely mad. And he\u2019s so stressed anyway. Do I cancel the dad? Send a quick rain-check apology email? Or will that make everything even worse between them?</p><p>There\u2019s only one tiny ray of hope. Sam\u2019s dad never sent any reply, which is why I forgot about it. So maybe he never even got the email. Maybe it\u2019s all OK\u2014</p> <p>I suddenly realize I\u2019m nodding emphatically, as though to persuade myself. One of the girls with Willow looks up and eyes me curiously. Oops.</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say out loud. \u201cSo ... I\u2019ll just ... Good. Yes.\u201d I hastily turn on my heel. If there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t want, it\u2019s being busted by Willow. I scurry to the safety of Sam\u2019s office and am about to grab the phone to email Sam\u2019s dad, when I see Sam and Vicks marching back toward the office, apparently in the middle of a blazing argument. They look a bit terrifying, and I find myself backing hastily into the bathroom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they stride in, neither of them even notices me.</p><p>\u201cWe cannot release this statement,\u201d Sam is saying furiously.

He can say what he likes in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d says Sam sarcastically. \u201cBut meanwhile his own board won\u2019t stand by him. What kind of vote of confidence is that?

But he\u2019s not everything to this company. Not anymore.\u201d She winces at Sam\u2019s glare but carries on. \u201cHe\u2019s one man. One brilliant, flawed, high-profile man.

A very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Sam exhales sharply and walks a few paces off, as though trying to calm himself. I\u2019m watching, agog, not daring even to breathe.</p> <p>\u201cSo you side with them,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of siding. You know my affection for Nick.\u201d She\u2019s looking more and more uncomfortable. \u201cBut this is a modern business. Not some quirky family firm. We owe it to our backers, our clients, our staff\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Vicks. Listen to yourself.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sharp silence. Neither of them is looking at the other. Vicks\u2019s face is creased and troubled-looking. Sam\u2019s hair is more rumpled than ever, and he looks absolutely furious.</p><p>I feel a bit stunned by the intensity in the room. I always thought being in PR sounded like a fun job. I had no idea it was like this.</p><p>\u201cVicks.\u201d The unmistakable drawl of Justin Cole hits the air, and a moment later he\u2019s in the room, wafting Fahrenheit and satisfaction. \u201cGot this under control, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lawyers are on it. We\u2019re just drafting a press statement.\u201d She gives him a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cBecause, for the sake of the company, we need to be careful that none of the other directors are tainted with these unfortunate ... views. You know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in hand, Justin.\u201d</p><p>From Vicks\u2019s sharp tone, I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t like Justin any more than Sam does.77</p><p>\u201cGreat.

Great shame.\u201d Justin looks delighted. \u201cStill, he is getting on now\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe is not getting on.\u201d Sam scowls at Justin. \u201cYou really are an arrogant little shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper!\u201d Justin says pleasantly. \u201cOh, tell you what, Sam. Let\u2019s send him an e-card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys!\u201d Vicks sounds close to the edge.</p><p>I can totally understand now why Sam was talking about victories and camps.

His shoulders have slumped and he sounds so low I almost want to go and give him a hug.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one bright ray.\u201d Vicks\u2019s voice is softer now, as though she wants to treat him gently in his defeat. \u201cThey\u2019re keeping it for the ten o\u2019clock, so we have a good six hours or so to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot can happen in six hours,\u201d I volunteer timidly, and both of them jump as though scalded.</p><p>\u201c She\u2019s still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy.\u201d Even Sam looks taken aback. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea you\u2019d still be here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe heard all that?\u201d Vicks looks like she wants to hit someone. \u201cSam, are you out of your mind ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say anything!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d Sam breathes out. \u201cMy mistake. Poppy, this isn\u2019t your fault; I was the one who invited you. I\u2019ll find someone to escort you out.\u201d He leans his head out of his office door. \u201cStephanie? Borrow you a sec?\u201d</p><p>A few moments later a pleasant-looking girl with long blond hair arrives at the office.</p><p>\u201cCan you take our visitor down, sign her out, sort out the pass, all that?\u201d says Sam. \u201cSorry, Poppy, I\u2019d do it myself, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d I say at once. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re tied up, I understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe meeting!\u201d says Sam, as though suddenly remembering. \u201cOf course. Poppy, I\u2019m sorry. It was canceled. But it\u2019ll be rearranged. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I muster a smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He won\u2019t. But I don\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cI hope it all works out well for you,\u201d I add. \u201cAnd Sir Nicholas.\u201d</p> <p>Vicks\u2019s eyes are swiveling madly in her head. She\u2019s obviously paranoid that I\u2019m about to spill the beans.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to do about Sam\u2019s dad. I can\u2019t possibly tell Sam now\u2014he\u2019ll explode from stress. I\u2019ll just have to get a message to the hotel or something. And then bow out.</p><p>Like maybe I should have done in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWell ... thanks again.\u201d I meet Sam\u2019s eyes and feel a strange pang. This really is the last goodbye. \u201cHere you are.\u201d I proffer the phone.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He takes it from me and puts it down on his desk. \u201cSorry about all this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I hope it all ... \u201d I nod several times, not daring to say any more in front of Stephanie.</p><p>It\u2019s going to be odd, not being in Sam\u2019s life anymore. I\u2019ll never know how any of it turns out. Maybe I\u2019ll read about this memo in the papers. Maybe I\u2019ll read an announcement about Sam and Willow in a wedding column.</p><p>\u201cBye, then.\u201d I turn and follow Stephanie down the corridor. A couple of people are walking along with overnight bags, and as we get into the lift they\u2019re in mid-conversation about the hotel and how crap the minibar is.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s your conference today,\u201d I say politely as we arrive at the ground floor. \u201cHow come you\u2019re not down there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, we stagger it.\u201d She ushers me out into the lobby. \u201cA whole bunch of people are already there, and the second coach is leaving in a few minutes. I\u2019ll be on that. Although actually tomorrow\u2019s the main event. That\u2019s when we have the gala dinner and Santa Claus\u2019s speech. It\u2019s usually quite fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanta Claus?\u201d I can\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we call Sir Nicholas. You know, a silly in-house nickname. Sir Nick, St. Nick, Santa Claus\u2014it\u2019s a bit lame, I know.\u201d She smiles. \u201cIf you can give me your security pass?\u201d</p><p>I hand over the laminated card and she gives it to one of the security personnel. He says something about \u201cnice photo,\u201d but I\u2019m not listening. An odd feeling is creeping over me.</p> <p>Santa Claus. Wasn\u2019t that bloke who called Violet\u2019s phone going on about Santa Claus? Is that a coincidence?</p><p>As Stephanie leads me across the marble floor to the main doors, I\u2019m trying to remember what he said. It was all about surgery. Incisions. Something about no trace \u2014</p><p>I stop dead, my heart thumping. That\u2019s the same phrase Sam used just now. No trace.</p><p>\u201cOK?\u201d Stephanie notices I\u2019ve stopped.</p><p>\u201cFine! Sorry.\u201d I shoot her a smile and resume walking along, but my mind is wheeling. What else did that guy say? What exactly was it about Santa Claus? Come on, Poppy, think.</p> <p>\u201cWell, bye! Thanks for visiting!\u201d Stephanie smiles once more.</p><p>\u201cThank you! \u2019 And as I step outside onto the pavement, I feel a jolt inside. I have it: Adi\u00f3s, Santa Claus.</p><p>More people are coming out of the building, and I step aside to where a window cleaner is swooshing suds all over the glass. I reach into my bag and start scrabbling around for the Lion King program. Please don\u2019t say I\u2019ve lost it, please \u2014</p><p>I haul it out, and stare at my scribbled words.</p><p>April 18: Scottie has a contact, keyhole surgery, no trace, be fucking careful.</p><p>April 20: Scottie rang. It\u2019s done. Surgical strike. No trace. Genius stuff. Adi\u00f3s, Santa Claus.</p> <p>It\u2019s as though the voices are playing back in my mind. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m listening to them again. I\u2019m hearing the older drawl and the young, reedy voice.</p><p>And suddenly I know without a shadow of a doubt who left the first message. It was Justin Cole.</p><p>Oh. My God.</p><p>I\u2019m quivering all over. I have to get back in and show these messages to Sam. They mean something, I don\u2019t know what, but something. I push the big glass doors open, and the concierge girl immediately appears in front of me. When I was with Sam she waved us through, but now she smiles remotely at me, as though she hasn\u2019t just seen me walking along with Stephanie.</p><p>\u201cHello. Do you have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cI need to see Sam Roxton at White Globe Consulting. Poppy Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>I wait while she turns away and makes a call on her cell phone. I\u2019m trying to stand there patiently, but I\u2019m barely able to contain myself. Those messages are something to do with this whole memo thing. I know they are.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The girl faces me with professional pleasantness. \u201cSam is unavailable right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould you tell him it\u2019s urgent?\u201d I shoot back. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Clearly restraining a desire to tell me to go away, the girl turns and makes another call, which lasts all of thirty seconds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Another frozen smile. \u201cMr. Roxton is busy for the remainder of the day, and most of the other staff are away at the company conference. Perhaps you should phone his assistant and make an appointment. Now, if you could please make way for our other guests?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s ushering me out of the main doors. Make way clearly means piss off.</p><p>\u201cLook, I need to see him.\u201d I duck round her and start heading for the escalators. \u201cPlease let me go up there. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d she says, grabbing me by the sleeve. \u201cYou can\u2019t just march in there! Thomas?\u201d</p><p>Oh, you have to be kidding. She\u2019s calling over the security guard. What a wimp.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a real emergency.\u201d I appeal to both of them. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to see me. \u2019</p><p>\u201cThen call and make an appointment!\u201d she snaps, as the security guard leads me to the main doors.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I snap back. \u201cI will! I\u2019ll call right now! See you in two minutes!\u201d I stomp onto the pavement and reach into my pocket.</p><p>And then the full horror hits me. I don\u2019t have a phone.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a phone.</p><p>I\u2019m powerless. I can\u2019t get into the building and I can\u2019t ring Sam. I can\u2019t tell him about this. I can\u2019t do anything. Why didn\u2019t I buy a new phone earlier? Why don\u2019t I always walk around with a spare phone? It should be the law, like having a spare tire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I hurry over to the window cleaner. \u201cDo you have a phone I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, love.\u201d He clicks his teeth. \u201cI do, but it\u2019s out of battery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I smile, breathless with anxiety. \u201cThanks anyway\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>I stop midstream, peering through the glass into the building.

He threw me out! I\u2019ve never been physically thrown out of anywhere in my life. I didn\u2019t think they were allowed to do that.</p><p>A crowd of people has arrived at the entrance and I stand aside to let them go in, my thoughts skittering wildly. Should I hurry down the street and try to find a pay phone? Should I try to get in again? Should I make a run for it into the lobby and see how far I get before I\u2019m tackled to the ground? Sam\u2019s standing in front of the lifts now, still talking to the guy with the leather briefcase. He\u2019ll be gone in a few moments. It\u2019s torture. If I could only attract his attention ...</p><p>\u201cNo luck?\u201d says the window cleaner sympathetically from the top of his ladder. He\u2019s covered an entire massive pane of glass with suds and is about to wipe them off with his scraper thing.</p><p>And then it comes to me.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I call urgently up to him. \u201cDon\u2019t wipe! Please!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve never written in soap suds in my life before, but luckily I\u2019m not aiming for anything very ambitious. Just MAS. In six-foot-high letters. A bit wobbly\u2014but who\u2019s fussing?</p><p>\u201cNice job,\u201d says the window cleaner approvingly from where he\u2019s sitting. \u201cYou could come into business with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say modestly, and wipe my brow, my arm aching.</p><p>If Sam doesn\u2019t see that, if someone doesn\u2019t notice it and poke him on the shoulder and say, \u201cHey, look at that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d</p><p>I turn and look down from my perch on the window cleaner\u2019s ladder. Sam\u2019s standing there on the pavement, looking up at me incredulously.</p><p>\u201cIs that addressed to me?\u201d</p><p>We travel upstairs in silence. Vicks is waiting in Sam\u2019s office, and as she sees me she bangs her forehead with the heel of her hand.</p> <p>\u201cThis had better be good,\u201d says Sam tersely, closing the glass door behind us. \u201cI have five minutes. There\u2019s a bit of an emergency going on\u2014\u201d</p><p>I feel a flash of anger. Does he think I don\u2019t realize that? Does he think I wrote SAM in six-foot sudsy letters on a whim?</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d I say, matching his curt tone. \u201cI just thought you might be interested in these messages, which came in to Violet\u2019s phone last week. This phone.\u201d I reach for the phone, still lying on his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhose phone is that?\u201d says Vicks, eyeing me with suspicion.</p><p>\u201cViolet\u2019s,\u201d replies Sam. \u201cMy PA? Clive\u2019s daughter? Shot off to be a model?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, her.\u201d Vicks frowns again and jerks a thumb at me. \u201cWell, what was she doing with Violet\u2019s phone?\u201d</p><p>Sam and I exchange glances.</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d says Sam at last. \u201cViolet threw it away. Poppy was ... babysitting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a couple of messages, which I wrote down.\u201d I put the Lion King program down between them and read the messages out for good measure, as I know my writing isn\u2019t that clear. \u201cScottie has a contact, keyhole surgery, no trace, be fucking careful.\u201d I point at the program. \u201cThis second message was a few days later, from Scottie himself. It\u2019s done. Surgical strike. No trace. Genius stuff. Adi\u00f3s, Santa Claus. \u201d I let the words sink in a moment before I add, \u201cThe first message was from Justin Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustin?\u201d Sam looks alert.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize his voice at the time, but I do now.

Can we still listen to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They were just ... you know. Phone messages. They left them and I wrote them down.\u201d</p> <p>Vicks looks perplexed. \u201cOK, this makes no sense. Did you introduce yourself? Why would Justin have left a message with you ?\u201d She exhales angrily. \u201cSam, I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t realize I was a person,\u201d I explain, flushing. \u201cI pretended to be an answering machine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She stares at me, uncomprehending.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d I put on my voice-mail-lady voice. \u201c I\u2019m afraid the person you\u2019ve called is not available. Please leave a message. And then he left the message and I wrote them down.\u201d</p><p>Sam gives a muffled snort of laughter, but Vicks looks speechless. She picks up the Lion King program, frowning at the words, then flicking through to the inside pages, although the only information she\u2019ll find there is the actors\u2019 biographies. At last she puts it back down on the table. \u201cSam, this means nothing. It changes nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does not mean nothing.\u201d He shakes his head adamantly. \u201cThis is it! Right here.\u201d He jabs a thumb at the program. \u201c This is what\u2019s been going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s been going on?\u201d Her voice rises in exasperation. \u201cWho\u2019s Scottie, for fuck\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called Sir Nicholas \u2018Santa Claus.\u2019 \u201d Sam\u2019s face is screwed up with thought. \u201cWhich means it\u2019s likely to be someone in the company. But where? In IT?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Violet anything to do with it?\u201d I venture. \u201cIt was her phone, after all.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a moment\u2014then Sam shakes his head, almost regretfully.</p><p>\u201cShe was only here for about five minutes, and her father\u2019s a good friend of Sir Nicholas... . I just can\u2019t believe she\u2019s involved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why did they leave messages for her? Did they have the wrong number or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely.\u201d Sam wrinkles his nose. \u201cI mean, why this number?\u201d</p><p>Automatically I look at the phone, flashing away on the desk. I wonder in a detached way if I\u2019ve got any voice mails. But somehow, right at this minute, the rest of my life seems a million miles away. The world has shrunk to this room. Both Sam and Vicks have sunk into chairs and I follow suit.</p><p>\u201cWho had Violet\u2019s phone before her?\u201d says Vicks suddenly. \u201cIt\u2019s a company phone. She was only here for, what, three weeks? Could it have been someone else\u2019s number previously and those messages were left by mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I look up, galvanized. \u201cPeople are always calling the wrong number by mistake. And emailing the wrong address. I even do it myself. You forget to delete it and press the contact\u2019s name and the old number pops up and you don\u2019t realize. Especially if you go to some generic voice mail.\u201d</p><p>I can see Sam\u2019s mind working overtime.</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d he says, reaching for a landline phone on the desk. He jabs in a three-digit speed-dial and waits.</p><p>\u201cHi, Cynthia. Sam here,\u201d he says easily. \u201cJust a quick question about the cell phone that was allocated to Violet, my PA. I was wondering: Did anyone else have it before her? Did anyone else ever have that number?\u201d</p> <p>As he listens, his face changes. He makes a fierce, silent gesture at Vicks, who shrugs back helplessly.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he says. \u201cThanks, Cynthia\u2014\u201d</p><p>From the stream of tinny sound coming from the phone, it\u2019s clear this Cynthia likes to talk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go... .\u201d Sam is rolling his eyes desperately. \u201cYes, I know the phone should have been delivered back... . No, we haven\u2019t misplaced it, don\u2019t worry... . Yes, very unprofessional. No warning... . I know, company property ... I\u2019ll pop it along ... yes ... yes ... \u201d</p><p>At last he manages to extricate himself. He puts the receiver down and is silent for an agonizing three seconds before turning to Vicks.</p><p>\u201cEd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Vicks breathes.</p><p>Sam has picked up the phone and is staring incredulously at it. \u201cThis was Ed\u2019s company phone till four weeks ago. Then it was reassigned to Violet. I had no idea.\u201d Sam turns to me. \u201cEd Exton was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d I nod. \u201cFinance director. Fired.

Nick is smeared. Bruce axes him because he\u2019s a pusillanimous asshole. The board needs another CEO, quick.

Someone Scottish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t actually sound Scottish,\u201d I volunteer. \u201cMaybe his nickname\u2019s a joke?\u201d</p><p>Sam suddenly focuses on me, the light dawning on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Of course. Poppy, would you know his voice again if you heard it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam!\u201d Vicks interrupts sharply before I can answer. \u201cNo way. You can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVicks, would you step out of denial for one second ?\u201d Sam rises to his feet, erupting in fury. \u201cThe faked memo wasn\u2019t an accident. The leak to ITN wasn\u2019t an accident. This is happening. Someone did this to Nick. This isn\u2019t just a matter of hushing up a little bit of embarrassing\u201d\u2014He gropes for a moment\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know, Facebook activity. It\u2019s a smear. It\u2019s fraud. \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a theory. \u201d She squares up to him. \u201cNothing more, Sam. A few words on a fucking Lion King program.\u201d</p><p>I feel a bit hurt. It\u2019s not my fault all I had with me was a Lion King program.</p><p>\u201cWe need to identify this guy Scottie.\u201d Sam turns to me. \u201cWould you know his voice if you heard it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, a little nervous at his intensity.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s go and find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam, stop right now!\u201d Vicks sounds furious. \u201cYou\u2019re insane! What are you going to do, get her to listen to every staff member talk till she hears that voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Sam mutinously.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the most ridiculous fucking idea I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d Vicks explodes. \u201cThat\u2019s why not!\u201d</p><p>Sam regards her steadily, then turns to me. \u201cCome on, Poppy. We\u2019ll trawl the building.\u201d</p><p>Vicks is shaking her head. \u201cAnd if she does recognize his voice? Then what? Citizen\u2019s arrest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll be a start,\u201d says Sam. \u201cReady, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy.\u201d Vicks comes over and faces me head-on. Her cheeks are pink and she\u2019s breathing hard. \u201cI have no idea who you are. But you don\u2019t have to listen to Sam. You don\u2019t have to do this. You owe him nothing. This is all nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d says Sam. \u201cDo you, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>Vicks ignores him. \u201cPoppy, I strongly advise you to leave. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of girl Poppy is,\u201d says Sam with a scowl. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t bail out on people. Do you?\u201d He meets my eyes, and his gaze is so unexpectedly warm, I feel an inward glow.</p><p>I turn to Vicks. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I do owe Sam one. And Sir Nicholas is a potential patient at my physio practice, actually. So he is something to do with me too.\u201d</p><p>I quite liked dropping that in, although I bet Sir Nicholas never does make it down to Balham.</p><p>\u201cAnd anyway,\u201d I continue, lifting my chin nobly, \u201c whoever it was, whether I knew them or not, if I could help in some way, I would. I mean, if you can help, you have to help. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Vicks stares at me for a moment, as though trying to work me out\u2014then gives a strange, wry smile.</p><p>\u201cOK. Well, you got me. I can\u2019t argue against that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Sam makes for the door.</p><p>I grab my bag and wish yet again that my T-shirt didn\u2019t have a huge great splotch on it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Wallander,\u201d Vicks chimes in sarcastically. \u201cSmall point. In case you\u2019d forgotten, everyone\u2019s either at the conference or on their way to the conference.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another silence, apart from Sam tapping his pen furiously again. I don\u2019t dare speak. I certainly don\u2019t dare look at Vicks.</p> <p>\u201cPoppy,\u201d says Sam at last. \u201cDo you have a few hours? Could you come down to Hampshire?\u201d</p><p>77 Or than I do, for that matter. Not that anyone\u2019s asked me.</p><p>11</p><p>This is totally surreal. And thrilling. And a bit of a pain. All at the same time.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019m regretting my noble gesture, exactly. I still mean what I said in the office. How could I possibly walk away? How could I not at least try to help Sam out? But, on the other hand, I thought it would take about half an hour. Not a train journey down to Hampshire, just for starters.</p> <p>I\u2019m supposed to be at the hairdresser\u2019s right now. I\u2019m supposed to be talking about updos and trying on my tiara. Instead, I\u2019m on Waterloo station concourse, buying a cup of tea and clutching the phone, which, needless to say, I grabbed from the desk as we left. Sam could hardly complain. I\u2019ve texted Sue to tell her that I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019ll have to miss the appointment with Louis, but of course I\u2019ll pay the whole fee and please give Louis my love.</p><p>I looked at it after I\u2019d finished typing it, and I deleted half the kisses. Then I put them back in again. Then I took them out again. Maybe five is enough.</p><p>Now I\u2019m waiting for Magnus to pick up. He\u2019s leaving for his stag trip to Bruges this afternoon, so it\u2019s not like I was going to see him, but still. I feel like if I don\u2019t at least ring him, it\u2019ll be wrong.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Magnus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPops!\u201d The line is terrible, and I can hear the public-address system in the background. \u201cWe\u2019re about to board. You OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I just wanted to ... \u201d I trail off, not sure where I\u2019m going with this.</p> <p>Just wanted to tell you that I\u2019m off to Hampshire with a man you know nothing about, embroiled in a situation you know nothing about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ... be out tonight,\u201d I say lamely. \u201cIn case you call.\u201d</p><p>There. That\u2019s honest. Kind of.</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d He laughs. \u201cWell, you have fun. Sweets, I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK! Bye! Have a good time!\u201d The phone goes dead and I look up to see Sam watching me. I tug my shirt self-consciously, wishing again that I\u2019d popped to the shops. It turns out that Sam does keep a spare shirt in his office, and my T-shirt was so frightful that I borrowed it. But it makes the situation even stranger, wearing his stripy Turnbull &amp; Asser.</p><p>\u201cSaying goodbye to Magnus,\u201d I explain needlessly, as he\u2019s been standing there the whole time and must have heard every word.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be two pounds.\u201d The woman at the sandwich shop hands me my cup.</p><p>\u201cThanks! Right ... shall we go?\u201d</p> <p>As Sam and I walk down the concourse and get into the carriage, I feel unreal. I\u2019m stiff with awkwardness. We must look like a couple to anyone watching. What if Willow sees us?</p><p>No. Don\u2019t be paranoid. Willow was on the second coach to the conference. She sent an email to Sam, telling him. And, anyway, it\u2019s not like Sam and I are doing anything illicit. We\u2019re just ... friends.</p><p>No, friends doesn\u2019t feel right. Not colleagues either. Not really acquaintances ...</p><p>OK. Let\u2019s face it. It\u2019s weird.</p><p>I glance over at Sam to see if he\u2019s thinking the same, but he\u2019s staring blankly out the train window. The train jolts and moves off down the tracks, and he comes to. As he catches me gazing at him, I quickly look away.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to appear relaxed, but secretly I\u2019m feeling more and more freaked out. What have I agreed to? Everything rests on my memory. It\u2019s up to me, Poppy Wyatt, to identify some voice I heard down a phone days ago, for about twenty seconds. What if I fail?</p><p>I take a sip of tea to calm myself, and I wince. First the soup was too cold. Now this is too hot. The train starts rushing along the tracks and a spot of tea jumps out of the lid, scalding my hand.</p><p>\u201cOK?\u201d Sam\u2019s noticed me.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I be honest?\u201d he says bluntly. \u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good!\u201d I protest. \u201cI\u2019m just ... you know. There\u2019s a lot going on at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Sam nods. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we never got to go through those confrontation techniques I promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!

That.\u2019 \u201d Sam shakes his head, looking exasperated. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. You automatically put yourself second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t! I mean ... you know.\u201d I shrug awkwardly. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p> <p>The train pulls up at Clapham Junction, and a group of people files into the carriage. For a while Sam is engrossed in texting. His phone has been constantly flashing, and I can only imagine how many messages are flying around. Eventually though, he puts the phone back in his pocket and leans forward, resting his elbow on the little table between us.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d I ask timidly, immediately realizing what an inane question this is. To his credit, Sam ignores it.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cWhat is it about these Tavishes that makes you feel as though they\u2019re superior? Is it the titles? The doctorates? The brains?\u201d</p><p>Not this again.</p><p>\u201cEverything! It\u2019s obvious! They\u2019re just ... I mean, you respect Sir Nicholas, don\u2019t you?\u201d I throw back at him defensively. \u201cLook at all this effort you\u2019re making for him. It\u2019s because you respect him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I respect him. Of course I do. But I don\u2019t feel as though I\u2019m inherently inferior to him. He doesn\u2019t make me feel like a second-class citizen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like a second-class citizen! You don\u2019t know anything about it. So ... stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Sam lifts his hands up high. \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, I apologize. It\u2019s only an impression I\u2019ve got. I only wanted to help, as a ... \u201d I can sense him reaching for the word friend, then rejecting it, like I did. \u201cI just wanted to help,\u201d he ends finally. \u201cBut it\u2019s your life. I\u2019ll butt out.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while. He\u2019s stopped. He\u2019s given up. I\u2019ve won.</p><p>Why don\u2019t I feel like I\u2019ve won?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Sam puts his phone to his ear. \u201cVicks. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p> <p>He heads out of the carriage and, without meaning to, I exhale in a massive sigh. The gnawing pain is back, nestling beneath my ribs. But right now I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because the Tavishes don\u2019t want me to marry Magnus, or because I\u2019m trying to deny it, or because I\u2019m nervous about this whole escapade, or because my tea\u2019s too strong.</p><p>For a while I sit there, gazing down at my steaming tea, wishing that I\u2019d never heard the Tavishes arguing in the church. That I knew nothing. That I could blot that gray cloud out of my life and go back to lucky, lucky me, isn\u2019t everything perfect?</p><p>Sam takes his seat again, and there\u2019s silence for a few moments. The train has come to a halt in the middle of nowhere, and it\u2019s oddly quiet without the sound of the engine.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I stare down at the little Formica table. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, you\u2019re not wrong.\u201d</p><p>Sam says nothing, just waits. The train jolts and lurches, like a horse deciding whether to behave, then slowly begins moving off again down the tracks.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not making this up in my head or whatever you think.\u201d I hunch my shoulders miserably. \u201cI overheard the Tavishes, OK? They don\u2019t want Magnus to marry me. I\u2019ve done everything I can. I\u2019ve played Scrabble and I\u2019ve tried making conversation and I\u2019ve even read Antony\u2019s book.78 But I\u2019ll never be like them. Never.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should you?\u201d Sam looks perplexed. \u201cWhy would you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d I roll my eyes. \u201cWhy would anyone want to be a really brainy celebrity who goes on TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAntony Tavish has a big brain,\u201d says Sam steadily. \u201cHaving a big brain is like having a big liver or a big nose. Why do you feel insecure? What if he had a huge lower intestine? Would you feel insecure then?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giggling.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a freak, strictly speaking.\u201d Sam presses on. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying into a family of freaks. To be in the outermost centile of anything is freakish. Next time you\u2019re intimidated by them, imagine a big neon sign over their heads, reading, FREAKS!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what you really think.\u201d I\u2019m smiling but shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cIt is absolutely what I think.\u201d He looks deadly serious now. \u201cThese academic guys have to feel important. They give papers and present TV shows to show they\u2019re useful and valuable. But you do useful, valuable work every day. You don\u2019t need to prove anything. How many people have you treated? Hundreds. You\u2019ve reduced their pain. You\u2019ve made hundreds of people happier.

Have you?\u201d I can\u2019t help saying, and Sam shoots me a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>The train slows as it passes though Woking, and we both instinctively look out the window. Then Sam turns back. \u201cThe point is, it\u2019s not about them. It\u2019s about you. You and him. Magnus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI know it is.\u201d</p><p>It sounds strange, hearing Magnus\u2019s name on his lips. It feels all wrong.</p><p>Magnus and Sam are so very different. It\u2019s like they\u2019re made out of different stuff. Magnus is so shiny, so mercurial, so impressive, so sexy. But a teeny-weeny bit self-obsessed.79 Whereas Sam is so ... straight and strong. And generous. And kind. You just know he\u2019d always be there for you, whatever.</p><p>Sam looks at me now and smiles, as though he can read my thoughts, and my heart experiences that tiny fillip it always does when he smiles.</p><p>Lucky Willow.</p> <p>I give an inward gasp at my own thought and take a gulp of tea to cover my embarrassment.</p><p>That popped into my head with no warning. And I didn\u2019t mean it. Or, rather, yes, I did mean it but simply in the sense that I wish them both well, as a disinterested friend\u2014no, not friend ...</p><p>I\u2019m blushing.</p><p>I\u2019m blushing at my own stupid, nonsensical, meaningless thought process, which, by the way, nobody knows about except me. So I can relax. I can stop this now and drop the ridiculous idea that Sam can read my mind and knows I fancy him\u2014</p><p>No. Stop. Stop. That\u2019s ridiculous.</p><p>This is just\u2014</p> <p>Erase the word fancy. I do not. I do not.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Sam gives me a curious look. \u201cPoppy, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t! I appreciate it. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because\u2014\u201d He breaks off to answer his phone. \u201cVicks. Any news?\u201d</p><p>As Sam heads outside for another call, I gulp my tea, staring fixedly out the window, willing my blood to cool and my brain to go blank. I need to backtrack. I need to reboot. Do not save changes.</p><p>To establish a more businesslike atmosphere, I reach in my pocket for the phone, check it for messages, then put it on the table. There\u2019s nothing on general email about the memo crisis\u2014clearly it\u2019s all going on between a select number of high-level colleagues.</p><p>\u201cYou do know you have to buy another phone at some point,\u201d says Sam, raising an eyebrow as he returns. \u201cOr are you planning to purloin all your phones from bins from now on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only place.\u201d I shrug. \u201cBins and skips.\u201d</p> <p>The phone buzzes with an email and I automatically reach for it, but Sam gets there first. His hand brushes against mine, and our eyes lock.</p><p>\u201cMight be for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I nod. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>He checks it, then shakes his head. \u201cWedding-trumpeter bill. All yours.\u201d</p><p>With a little grin of triumph, I take the phone from him. I send a quick reply to Lucinda, then put it back on the table. As it buzzes again a few moments later, we both make a grab and I just beat him.</p><p>\u201cShirt sale.\u201d I pass it to him. \u201cNot really my thing.\u201d Sam deletes the email, then replaces the phone on the table.</p><p>\u201cIn the middle!\u201d I shift it an inch. \u201cCheat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on your lap,\u201d he retorts. \u201cCheat.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. We\u2019re both sitting poised, waiting for the phone to buzz. Sam looks so deadly intent I feel a laugh rising. Someone else\u2019s phone rings across the carriage, and Sam makes a half grab for ours before realizing.</p><p>\u201cTragic,\u201d I murmur. \u201cDoesn\u2019t even know the ring tone.\u201d</p><p>Ours bleeps with a text, and Sam\u2019s momentary hesitation is just enough for me to scoop the phone up out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cHa-ha!

It\u2019s from an unknown number and only half the message has come in, but I can work out the gist\u2014</p><p>I read it again. And again. I look up at Sam and lick my suddenly dry lips.

Those two would totally suit each other.</p><p>I\u2019m scanning Sam\u2019s face for distress, but after that initial flash of shock, he seems extraordinarily calm. He frowns, flicks to the end of the text, then puts the phone back down on the table.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I can\u2019t help venturing.</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cMakes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I\u2019m so stirred up on his behalf, I can\u2019t help throwing in my views. \u201cWhy would she do that? And she gives you such a hard time! She\u2019s such a hypocrite! She\u2019s horrible!\u201d I break off, wondering if I\u2019ve gone too far. Sam is looking at me oddly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. It makes no sense because I\u2019m not engaged. I don\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re engaged to Willow,\u201d I say stupidly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201d I stare at him blankly. How can he not be engaged? Of course he\u2019s engaged.</p> <p>\u201cNever have been.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cWhat gave you that idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me! I know you told me!\u201d My face is screwed up, trying to remember. \u201cAt least ... yes! It was in an email. Violet sent it. It said, Sam\u2019s engaged. I know it did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d His brow clears. \u201cOccasionally I\u2019ve used that as an excuse to get rid of persistent people.\u201d He adds, as though to make it clear, \u201cWomen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excuse ?\u201d I echo incredulously. \u201cSo, who\u2019s Willow, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillow is my ex-girlfriend,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cWe split up two months ago.\u201d</p><p>Ex -girlfriend?</p><p>For a moment, I can\u2019t speak. My brain feels like a fruit machine, whirling round, trying to find the right combination. I can\u2019t cope with this. He\u2019s engaged. He\u2019s supposed to be engaged.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014you should have said!\u201d My agitation bursts out at last. \u201cAll this time, you let me think you were engaged!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I never mentioned it.\u201d He looks perplexed. \u201cWhy are you angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know! It\u2019s all wrong.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m breathing hard, trying to order my thoughts. How can he not be with Willow? Everything\u2019s different now. And it\u2019s all his fault.80</p><p>\u201cWe talked so much about everything.\u201d I try to speak more calmly. \u201cI mentioned Willow several times and you never specified who she was. How could you be so secretive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not secretive!\u201d He gives a short laugh. \u201cI would have explained who she was if the subject had come up. It\u2019s over. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it matters!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I want to scream with frustration. How can he ask why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?</p><p>\u201cBecause ... because ... she behaves as though you\u2019re together.\u201d And suddenly I realize this is what\u2019s upsetting me the most. \u201cShe behaves as though she has every right to rant at you. That\u2019s why I never doubted you were engaged. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d</p><p>Sam flinches as though with irritation but says nothing.</p><p>\u201cShe cc\u2019s your PA! She blurts everything out in public emails! It\u2019s bizarre!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillow\u2019s always been ... an exhibitionist. She likes an audience.\u201d He sounds reluctant to get into this. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the same boundaries as other people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo right she doesn\u2019t! Do you know how possessive she is? I overheard her talking at the office.\u201d A loudspeaker starts broadcasting announcements about upcoming stations, but I raise my voice over the noise. \u201cYou know she bitches about you to all the girls at the office? She told them you\u2019re just going through a bad patch and you need to wake up or you\u2019re going to realize what you\u2019re about to lose\u2014i.e., her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going through a bad patch.\u201d I hear a flash of real anger in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?

Did you sit down and have a proper talk with her?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Sam\u2019s not meeting my eye. He so did not sit down and have a proper talk with her. I know it. He probably sent her a brief text, saying, Over. Sam.</p><p>\u201cWell, you need to tell her to stop all this ridiculous emailing. Don\u2019t you?\u201d I try to get his attention. \u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s checking his phone again. Typical.

Oh my God, of course.</p><p>\u201cSam, do you ever actually reply to Willow\u2019s emails?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t, does he? Suddenly it\u2019s all clear. That\u2019s why she starts a fresh one each time. It\u2019s like she\u2019s pinning messages to a blank wall.</p><p>\u201cSo if you never reply, how does she know what you really think?\u201d I raise my voice still further over the speaker. \u201cOh, wait, she doesn\u2019t!

Obviously I wouldn\u2019t have spoken so loudly if I\u2019d realized that was about to happen. Obviously I wouldn\u2019t have used the f-word. So that mother with her children sitting three rows away can stop shooting me evil looks as though I\u2019m personally corrupting them.</p><p>\u201cYou really are!\u201d I continue in a furious undertone. \u201cYou can\u2019t just blank Willow out and think she\u2019ll go away. You can\u2019t press ignore forever. She won\u2019t go away, Sam. Take it from me. You need to talk to her and explain exactly what the situation is, and what is wrong with all this, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, leave it.\u201d Sam sounds irate. \u201cIf she wants to send pointless emails, she can send pointless emails. It doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s toxic! It\u2019s bad! It shouldn\u2019t happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d he snaps. I think I\u2019ve pressed a nerve.</p><p>And by the way, that\u2019s a joke. I don\u2019t know anything about it?</p><p>\u201cI know all about it!\u201d I contradict him. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with your in-box, remember? Mr. Blank, No Reply, Ignore Everything and Everyone.\u201d</p><p>Sam glares at me. \u201cJust because I don\u2019t reply to every email with sixty-five bloody smiley faces... .\u201d</p> <p>He is not turning this against me. What\u2019s better, smiley faces or denial?</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t reply to anyone, \u201d I retort scathingly. \u201cNot even your own dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sounds scandalised. \u201cWhat the hell are you going on about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read his email,\u201d I say defiantly. \u201cAbout how he wants to talk to you and he wishes you\u2019d come and visit him in Hampshire and he\u2019s got something to tell you. He said you and he hadn\u2019t talked for ages and he missed the old days. And you didn\u2019t even answer him. You\u2019re heartless.\u201d</p><p>Sam throws his head back in a roar of laughter. \u201cOh, Poppy. You really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll find I have a little more insight into your own life than you do.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him mutinously. Now I hope Sam\u2019s dad did get my email. Wait till Sam arrives at the Chiddingford Hotel and finds his father there, all dressed up and hopeful with a rose in his buttonhole. Then maybe he won\u2019t be so flippant.</p><p>Sam has picked up our phone and is reading the text again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not engaged,\u201d he says, his brows knitted. \u201cI don\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I got that, thanks,\u201d I say sarcastically. \u201cYou just have a psychotic ex who thinks she still owns you even though you broke up two months ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not following. The two of us are effectively sharing this phone right now, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Where\u2019s he going with this?</p><p>\u201cSo this message could have been meant for either of us.

It\u2019s crystal clear. Fianc\u00e9e, feminine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He nods. \u201cBut there is no fianc\u00e9e, feminine. She doesn\u2019t exist.

It can\u2019t.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if this is the right number. But I had to let you know. Your fianc\u00e9e has been unfaithful. It\u2019s someone you know.

Your friend.</p> <p>I\u2019m dimly aware of Sam picking up the phone and reading the text.</p><p>\u201cSome friend,\u201d he says at last, sounding grave. \u201cWhoever it is, they\u2019re probably just stirring. Probably no truth in it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d I nod several times. \u201cExactly. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s made up. Someone trying to freak me out for no good reason.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to seem confident, but my trembling voice gives me away.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday.\u201d</p> <p>Saturday.

I don\u2019t want to think about it. Annalise is my friend. I know she thought Magnus should have been hers, but surely ...</p><p>Annalise in her uniform, batting her eyelashes at Magnus. Her hands lingering on his shoulders.</p><p>No. Stop it. Stop it, Poppy.</p> <p>I bring my hands up to my face, screwing my fists into my eye sockets, wanting to rip my own thoughts out. Why did whoever-it-is have to send that text? Why did I have to read it?</p><p>It can\u2019t be true. It can\u2019t. It\u2019s just scurrilous, hurtful, damaging, horrible ...</p><p>A tear has escaped from beneath my fists and snaked down my cheek to my chin. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how to tackle this. Do I call Magnus in Bruges? Do I interrupt his stag do? But what if he\u2019s innocent and he gets angry and the trust between us is ruined?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be there in a few minutes.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice is low and wary. \u201cPoppy, if you\u2019re not up for this I\u2019ll totally understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am up for it.\u201d I lower my fists, reach for a paper napkin, and blow my nose. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.

At least I\u2019m doing something. At last I\u2019m not sitting here, wondering in pointless agony. I finish the text, press send with a tiny surge of adrenaline, and slurp the last of my tea. Come on, Unknown Number. Bring it on. Tell me what you\u2019ve got.</p><p>\u201cSent?\u201d Sam has been watching me.</p><p>\u201cYup. Now I\u2019ll just have to wait and see what they say.\u201d</p><p>The train is pulling into Basingstoke, and passengers are heading for the doors. I dump my cup in the litter bin, grab my bag, and stand up too.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough about my stupid problems.\u201d I force myself to smile at Sam. \u201cCome on.

But I seem to be the only one appreciating it as we arrive. Sam isn\u2019t in the best of moods. There was a problem getting a cab, then we got stuck behind some sheep, and then the taxi driver got lost. Sam has been texting furiously ever since we got into our taxi, and as we arrive, two men in suits, whom I don\u2019t recognize are waiting for us on the front steps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sam thrusts some notes at the driver and opens the taxi door almost before it brakes. \u201cPoppy, excuse me a moment.

There are croquet lawns and topiary and even a little chapel, which I bet is lovely for weddings. The place seems empty, and there\u2019s a freshness to the air which makes me shiver. Maybe I\u2019m nervous.

Staying calm. We don\u2019t want him rushing to London, looking like there\u2019s a crisis. He\u2019s speaking at a dinner tonight; we\u2019ll regroup tomorrow, see how things have played out. As for the conference, we keep going for now. Obviously Sir Nicholas was due to arrive here in the morning, but we\u2019ll have to see\u201d\u2014he hesitates, wincing slightly\u2014\u201cWhat happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the injunction?\u201d says Sam. \u201cI was talking to Julian; he\u2019s pulling out all the stops.\u201d</p><p>Robbie sighs. \u201cSam, we already know that won\u2019t work. I mean, we\u2019re not not going to apply for one, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stops midstream as we arrive in a big lobby. Wow. This conference is a lot more high-tech than our annual physiotherapists\u2019 one. There are massive WHITE GLOBE CONSULTING logos everywhere and big screens mounted all round the lobby. Someone is clearly using some kind of TV camera inside the hall, because images of an audience sitting in rows are being beamed out. There are two sets of closed double doors straight ahead of us, and the sound of an audience laughing suddenly emanates from them, followed, ten seconds later, by laughter from the screens.</p><p>The whole lobby is empty except for a table bearing a few lonely name badges, behind which a bored-looking girl is lolling. She stands up straighter as she sees us and smiles uncertainly at me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re having a good time,\u201d says Sam, glancing at the TV screen.</p><p>\u201cMalcolm\u2019s speaking,\u201d says Mark. \u201cHe\u2019s doing a great job.

I just got these messages, and I wondered if they could be relevant, and Sam worked it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she has something.\u201d Sam faces up to Mark and Robbie as though daring them to disagree. \u201cThe memo was planted. We all agree on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe memo is ... uncharacteristic,\u201d amends Robbie.</p><p>\u201cUncharacteristic?\u201d Sam looks like he wants to explode. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bloody write it! Someone else wrote it and inserted it into the system. We\u2019re going to find out who. Poppy heard the voice. Poppy will recognize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Robbie exchanges wary glances with Mark. \u201cAll I will say, Sam, is that we have to be very, very careful.

Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you planning to do?\u201d Mark looks genuinely interested.</p><p>\u201cWalk around. Listen. Find the needle in the haystack.\u201d Sam turns to me. \u201cYou up for that, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d I nod, trying to hide how panicked I feel. I\u2019m half-wishing I never took those messages down now.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then ... \u201d Robbie still looks dissatisfied.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s cross that bridge.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the room.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Robbie at last. \u201cDo it. Go on. I guess it can\u2019t do any harm. And how will you explain away Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew PA?\u201d suggests Mark.</p> <p>Sam shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019ve appointed a new PA, and half the floor has met her already. Let\u2019s keep it simple. Poppy\u2019s thinking of joining the company. I\u2019m showing her round. OK with that, Poppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that personnel list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Robbie hands it to him. \u201cBut be discreet, Sam.\u201d</p><p>Mark has opened the door a crack and is looking into the lobby.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming out,\u201d he says. \u201cAll yours.\u201d</p> <p>We head out of the room, into the lobby. Both sets of double doors are open and people are streaming out of them, all wearing badges and chatting, some laughing. They all look pretty fresh, given it\u2019s 6:30 p.m. and they\u2019ve been listening to speeches all afternoon.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many. \u201d I stare at the groups of people, feeling totally daunted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d says Sam firmly. \u201cYou know it\u2019s a male voice. That already cuts it down. We\u2019ll just go round the room and rule them out, one by one. I have my suspicions, but ... I won\u2019t bias you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I follow him into the m\u00eal\u00e9e. People are grabbing drinks from waiters and greeting each other and shouting jokes across other people\u2019s heads. It\u2019s cacophony. My ears feel as though they\u2019re radar sensors, straining this way and that to catch the sound of voices.</p><p>\u201cHeard our guy yet?\u201d Sam says, as he hands me a glass of orange juice. I can tell he\u2019s half joking, half hopeful.</p><p>I shake my head. I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. The sound in the room is like a melded roar in my head. I can barely distinguish any individual strands, let alone pick out the exact tones of a voice I heard for twenty seconds, days ago, down a mobile-phone line.</p><p>\u201cOK, let\u2019s be methodical.\u201d Sam is talking almost to himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll go round the room in concentric circles. Does that sound like a plan?\u201d</p><p>I flash him a smile, but I\u2019ve never felt so pressured in my life. No one else can do this. No one else heard that voice. It\u2019s down to me. Now I know how sniffer dogs must feel at airports.</p> <p>We head to a group of women, who are standing together with two middle-aged men.</p><p>\u201cHi there!\u201d Sam greets them all pleasantly. \u201cHaving a good time? Let me introduce Poppy, who\u2019s having a look round. Poppy, this is Jeremy ... and Peter... . Jeremy, how many years have you been with us now? And Peter? Is it three years?\u201d</p><p>OK. Now that I\u2019m listening properly, close up, this is easier. One man has a low growly voice and the other is Scandinavian. After about ten seconds I shake my head at Sam, and he moves us swiftly off to another group, discreetly ticking his list as we go.</p><p>\u201cHi there! Having a good time? Let me introduce Poppy, who\u2019s having a look round. Poppy, you\u2019ve already met Nihal. Now, Colin, what are you up to these days?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s amazing how different voices are, once you start to pay attention. Not only the pitch but the accents, the timbres, the little speech impediments and slurs and quirks.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I join in, smiling at a bearded guy who hasn\u2019t uttered a syllable.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been a tricky year ... \u201d he begins ponderously.</p><p>No. Uh-uh. Nothing like. I glance at Sam, shaking my head, and he abruptly takes hold of my arm.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dudley, we must dash.\u201d He heads to the next group along and charges straight in, interrupting an anecdote. \u201cPoppy, this is Simon... . Stephanie you\u2019ve met, I think ... Simon, Poppy was just admiring your jacket. Where\u2019s it from?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe how blatant Sam\u2019s being. He\u2019s practically ignoring all the women and being totally unsubtle about getting the men to talk. But I guess it\u2019s the only way.</p><p>The more voices I listen to, the more confident I feel. This is easier than I thought it would be, because they\u2019re all so different from the one on the phone. Except that we\u2019ve already been to four groups and eliminated them. I scan the room anxiously. What if I get all the way round the room and I still haven\u2019t heard the guy from the phone? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi there, gang! Having a good time?\u201d Sam is still in full flow as we approach the next group. \u201cLet me introduce Poppy, who\u2019s having a look round. Poppy, this is Tony. Tony, why don\u2019t you tell Poppy about your department? And here\u2019s Daniel, and this is ... ah. Willow.\u201d</p><p>She was turned away as we approached, so her face was averted, but now she faces us full on.</p><p>Yowzer.</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d she says, after such a long pause I start to feel embarrassed for everybody. \u201cWho\u2019s ... this?\u201d</p> <p>OK. If my text to Magnus was laden with meaning, that little two-word sentence of Willow\u2019s was collapsing under its weight. You don\u2019t have to be an expert in the Language of Willow to know that what she actually meant was, \u201cWho the FUCK is this girl and WHAT is she doing here with YOU? Jesus, Sam, are you DELIBERATELY SCREWING AROUND WITH ME? Because, believe me, you are going to regret that BADLY.\u201d</p><p>You know. Paraphrasing.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt such overt hostility from anyone in my life. It\u2019s like an electric current between us. Willow\u2019s nostrils are flared and whitening. Her eyes are all stary. Her hand has gripped her glass so tightly, her tendons are showing through her pale skin. But her smile is still soft and pleasant, and her voice is still mellifluous. Which is almost most creepy of all.</p><p>\u201cPoppy\u2019s thinking of joining the company,\u201d says Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Willow carries on smiling. \u201cLovely. Welcome, Poppy.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s unnerving me. She\u2019s like some alien. Behind the soft smile and the dulcet voice is a lizard.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, we must press on... . See you later, Willow.\u201d Sam takes my arm to guide me away.</p><p>Uh-oh. Bad idea. I can feel her laser eyes in my back. Does Sam not feel them too?</p><p>We head to a new group and Sam launches into his spiel, and I dutifully crane my neck to listen, but nobody sounds a bit like the phone guy. As we work our way farther round, I can tell Sam\u2019s getting dispirited, though he\u2019s trying to hide it. After we leave a group of youngish IT guys drinking beers, he says, \u201cReally? None of those guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shrug apologetically. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry!\u201d He gives a short, strained laugh. \u201cYou heard what you heard. You can\u2019t ... If it\u2019s not any of them\u2014\u201d He breaks off a moment. \u201cDefinitely not the blond guy? The one talking about his car? He didn\u2019t sound at all familiar?\u201d</p><p>And now the disappointment in his voice is evident.</p><p>\u201cIs that who you thought it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019I ... don\u2019t know.\u201d He spreads his hands, exhaling. \u201cMaybe. Yes. He\u2019d have the IT contacts, he\u2019s new to the company, Justin and Ed could easily have talked him round ... \u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to reply. Like he says, I heard what I heard.</p><p>\u201cI think some people have gone out to the terrace,\u201d I say, trying to be helpful.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll try there.\u201d He nods. \u201cLet\u2019s finish up here first.\u201d</p><p>Even I can tell that none of the four gray-haired men standing by the bar will be the guy from the phone\u2014and I\u2019m right. As Sam is inveigled into a conversation about Malcolm\u2019s speech, I take the opportunity to edge away and see if Magnus has replied. Of course he hasn\u2019t. But flashing at the top of my in-box is an email sent to</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>, cc\u2019ed to</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>, which makes me splutter.</p><p>Sam,</p><p>Nice try. I know EXACTLY what you\u2019re up to and you\u2019re PATHETIC. Where did you get her from, an agency? I would have thought you could do better than that.</p><p>Willow</p><p>As I\u2019m staring at the screen in disbelief, a second email pops in.</p><p>I mean, Jesus, Sam. She isn\u2019t even DRESSED for the occasion. Or are cutesy denim skirts suddenly appropriate conference wear??</p><p>My skirt is not cutesy! And I wasn\u2019t exactly planning to come to a conference when I got dressed this morning, was I?</p><p>In outrage, I press reply and type an email.</p><p>Actually, I think she\u2019s stunningly beautiful. And her denim skirt isn\u2019t cutesy. So there, Willow the Witch.</p><p>Sam.</p><p>Then I delete it. Naturally. I\u2019m about to put my phone away when a third email pops in from Willow. Honestly. Can\u2019t she give it a rest?</p><p>You want me to be jealous, Sam. Fine. I respect that. I even like it. We need sparks in our relationship. But TRY GIVING ME SOMETHING TO BE JEALOUS OF!!!</p><p>Because believe me, no one here is impressed by your little stunt. I mean, parading around some nondescript girl who clearly has NO IDEA HOW TO BLOW-DRY HER FUCKING HAIR ... Well. It\u2019s tragic, Sam. TRAGIC. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Talk to you when you\u2019re a grown-up.</p><p>Willow</p><p>I touch my hair defensively. I did blow-dry it this morning. It\u2019s just hard to get to the back bits. I mean, not that I care what she thinks, but I can\u2019t help feeling a little stung\u2014</p><p>My thoughts are interrupted mid-flow and I stare at the screen. I don\u2019t believe it. An email has arrived in the phone from Sam. He\u2019s responded to Willow. He\u2019s actually replied to her! Except he\u2019s pressed reply all, so it\u2019s come to me too.</p> <p>I glance up in astonishment and see that he\u2019s still talking to the gray-haired men, apparently engrossed. He must have rattled it off very quickly. I open up the email and see a single line.</p><p>Cut it out, Willow. You\u2019re not impressing anyone.</p><p>I blink at the screen. She won\u2019t like that.</p><p>I wait for her to launch some further scathing attack on Sam\u2014but no more emails arrive. Maybe she\u2019s as taken aback as I am.</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice rises above the hubbub. \u201cPoppy, few more people I\u2019d like you to meet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d I snap to attention, thrusting my phone away. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>We circulate around the rest of the room. Sam\u2019s list is covered with ticks. I must have listened to nearly every male voice in the company, and I haven\u2019t heard anybody who sounds anything like the guy on the phone. I\u2019m even starting to wonder whether I\u2019m remembering him right. Or whether I hallucinated the whole thing.</p><p>As we head along a carpeted corridor toward the open terrace doors, I can tell Sam is low. I feel pretty low myself.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d He looks up and seems to clock my mood. \u201cPoppy, seriously. I know you\u2019re doing your best.\u201d His face crinkles for a moment. \u201cHey, and I\u2019m sorry about Willow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I brush it off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p> <p>We walk in silence for a few moments. I want to say something like, \u201cThanks for sticking up for me,\u2019 but I\u2019m too awkward. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t really have been inside that email exchange.</p><p>The terrace is covered in lanterns, and there are a few clusters of people but not nearly as many as there were inside. I suppose it\u2019s too cold. But it\u2019s shame, because there\u2019s actually quite a nice partylike atmosphere out here. There\u2019s a bar, and a couple of people are even dancing. On the corner of the terrace, a guy holding a TV camera seems to be interviewing a pair of giggling girls.</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe we\u2019ll strike lucky.\u201d I try to sound upbeat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Sam nods, but I can tell he\u2019s given up.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if we don\u2019t find him out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ... we tried.\u201d Sam\u2019s face is taut, but for the briefest of moments his smile pops out. \u201cWe tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Well, let\u2019s do it.\u201d I put on my best motivational you- can -get-mobility-back-into-that-hip-joint voice. \u201cLet\u2019s try.\u201d</p><p>We head out and Sam launches into the same old routine.</p> <p>\u201cHi there, gang! Having a good time? Let me introduce Poppy, who\u2019s having a look round. Poppy, this is James. James, why don\u2019t you tell Poppy what your line is? And here\u2019s Brian, and this is Rhys.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not James or Brian or Rhys. Or Martin or Nigel.</p><p>Every name on Sam\u2019s list is ticked off. I almost want to cry when I look at his face. At last we step away from a group of interns who weren\u2019t even on the list and can\u2019t possibly be Scottie.</p><p>We\u2019re done.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone Vicks,\u201d Sam says, his voice a little heavy. \u201cPoppy, thanks for giving up your time. It was a stupid plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d I put a hand on his arm. \u201cIt ... could have worked.\u201d</p><p>Sam looks up and for a moment we just stand there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very kind,\u201d he says at last.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sam! Hi, guys!\u201d A girl\u2019s raised voice makes me flinch. Maybe I\u2019m sensitive because I\u2019ve been listening more carefully to the way people speak\u2014but this voice is setting my teeth on edge. I turn to see a bubbly-looking girl with a pink scarf tied in her hair approaching us with the TV camera guy, who has a dark crew cut and jeans.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cHi, Amanda.\u201d Sam nods. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re filming all the conference guests,\u201d she says cheerfully. \u201cJust a little shout-out, say hi, we\u2019ll show it at the gala dinner.\u201d</p><p>The TV camera is pointing in my face, and I flinch. I\u2019m not supposed to be here. I can\u2019t do a \u201clittle shout-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you like,\u201d Amanda prompts me. \u201cA personal message, a joke ... \u201d She consults her list, looking puzzled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know what department you\u2019re in... .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoppy\u2019s a guest,\u201d says Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d The girl\u2019s brow clears. \u201cLovely! Tell you what, since you\u2019re a special guest, why don\u2019t you do our Q and A interview? What do you think, Ryan? Do you know Ryan?\u201d she adds to Sam. \u201cHe\u2019s on an internship from the LSE for six months. He\u2019s been doing all our promotional filming. Hey, Ryan, get a close-up. Poppy\u2019s a special guest!\u201d</p><p>What?

Poppy.\u201d This is so stupid. What am I going to say to a conference of strangers?</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll do a shout-out to Willow.</p><p>Hey, Willow the Witch. You know how you think I\u2019m \u2018parading around\u2019 with your boyfriend? Well, here\u2019s the news flash. He\u2019s not your boyfriend anymore.</p><p>The thought makes me snort, and Amanda gives me an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Enjoy yourself. Ryan, do you want to start the Q and A?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. So, Poppy, what do you think of the conference so far?\u201d</p><p>The high-pitched, reedy voice which comes from behind the camera hits my ears like a twenty-volt shock.</p><p>It\u2019s him.</p><p>That\u2019s the voice I heard down the phone. This person talking to me now. This guy, with a crew cut and a camera on his shoulder. This is him.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d he prompts me, and my brain explodes with recognition again. The memory of his voice on the phone is running through my head like a TV sports replay.</p><p>It\u2019s Scottie. It\u2019s done. Like I said. It was a surgical strike.</p> <p>\u201cWhich was your favorite speech of the conference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t go to any of the speeches,\u201d interjects Sam.</p><p>\u201cOh. OK.\u201d</p><p>No trace. Genius stuff, if I say so myself. Adi\u00f3s, Santa Claus.</p><p>\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, how would you rate the drinks party?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Scottie.</p><p>This is Scottie. No question.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d He leans round the camera, looking impatient. \u201cYou can talk. We\u2019re rolling.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at his thin, intelligent face, my heart thumping, willing myself not to give anything away. I feel like a rabbit being mesmerized by a snake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Poppy.\u201d Sam steps forward, looking sympathetic. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. A lot of people get stage fright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I manage. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stare up at him helplessly. My voice won\u2019t work. I feel like I\u2019m in one of those dreams where you can\u2019t shout out that you\u2019re being murdered.</p><p>\u201cGuys, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s up for it,\u201d Sam\u2019s saying. \u201cCould you ... \u201d He gestures with his hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d Amanda puts a hand over her mouth. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to freak you out! Have a good evening!\u201d They head off to accost another group of people, and I stare after them, transfixed.</p><p>\u201cPoor old Poppy.\u201d Sam smiles ruefully. \u201cJust what you needed. Sorry about that, it\u2019s a new thing they\u2019re doing at the conferences, although I can\u2019t see what it adds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Somehow I cut him off, although I can still barely speak. \u201cShut up, shut up.\u201d</p><p>Sam looks astonished. I move closer to him and reach up on tiptoe until my mouth is touching his ear, his hair brushing against my skin. I inhale, breathing in his warmth and smell, then murmur, as quietly as a breath, \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>We stay outside for another twenty minutes. Sam has a long telephone conversation with Sir Nicholas\u2014none of which I can hear\u2014then a brief, brusque call with Mark, of which I catch bits and pieces as he strides around, his hand to his head: Well, company policy can fuck itself ... . the minute Vicks gets here ...</p><p>It\u2019s clear that tension levels are rising. I thought Sam would be happy that I\u2019d helped, but he looks even more grim than before. He ends the call by snapping, \u201cWhose side are you on, anyway? Jesus, Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... what are you going to do?\u201d I say timidly as he rings off.</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s company email is being searched. But he\u2019s sharp. He won\u2019t have used the company system.

You can imagine. He keeps his chin up. But he feels it far more than he\u2019s letting on.\u201d Sam\u2019s face twists briefly and he hunches his arms round his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou do too,\u201d I say gently, and Sam looks up in a startled movement, as though I\u2019ve caught him out.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I do,\u201d he says after a long pause. \u201cNick and I go back a long time. He\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s done some remarkable things over his lifetime. But if this smear gets out unchallenged, it\u2019ll be the only thing the wider world ever remembers about him. It\u2019ll be the same headline over and over, till he dies. Sir Nicholas Murray, suspected of corruption. He doesn\u2019t deserve that. He especially doesn\u2019t deserve to be stitched up by his own board.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a somber moment, then Sam visibly pulls himself together. \u201cAnyway. Come on. They\u2019re waiting for us. Vicks is nearly here.\u201d</p><p>We head back, past a group of girls clustered round a table, past an ornamental garden, toward the huge double doors leading into the hotel. My phone has been buzzing and I quietly take it out to check my in-box, just to see if Magnus has replied\u2014</p><p>I blink at the screen. I don\u2019t believe it. I give a tiny involuntary whimper, and Sam shoots me an odd look.</p> <p>There\u2019s a brand-new email right at the top of my in-box and I click on it, desperately hoping it won\u2019t say what I\u2019m dreading\u2014</p><p>Shit. Shit.</p><p>I stare at it in dismay. What am I going to do? We\u2019re nearly at the hotel. I have to speak. I have to tell him.</p><p>\u201cUm, Sam.\u201d My voice is a bit strangled. \u201cUm, stop a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He halts with a preoccupied frown, and my stomach lurches with nerves.</p><p>OK. Here\u2019s the thing. In my defense, if I\u2019d known Sam was going to be mired in a massive, urgent crisis involving leaked memos and senior government advisers and ITN News, I wouldn\u2019t have sent that email to his father. Of course I wouldn\u2019t.</p> <p>But I didn\u2019t know. And I did send the email. And now ...</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Sam looks impatient.</p><p>Where on earth do I start? How do I soften him up?</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t get angry,\u201d I throw out as a preemptive sally, even though it feels a bit like chucking an ice cube into the path of a forest fire.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d There\u2019s an ominous tone to Sam\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is ... \u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI thought I was doing the right thing. But I can see that you may not view it exactly that way... .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you\u2014\u201d He breaks off, his face suddenly clearing with appalled understanding. \u201cOh, Jesus. No. Please don\u2019t say you\u2019ve been telling your friends about this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cOf course not!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>I feel slightly emboldened by his wrong suspicions. At least I haven\u2019t been blabbing everything to my friends. At least I haven\u2019t been selling my story to The Sun.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family thing. It\u2019s about your dad.\u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s eyes widen sharply, but he says nothing.</p><p>\u201cI just felt bad that you and he weren\u2019t in contact. So I emailed him back. He\u2019s desperate to see you, Sam. He wants to reach out! You never go down to Hampshire, you never see him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he mutters, almost to himself. \u201cI really don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time for your own father?\u201d His words sting me. \u201cYou know what, Mr. Big Shot, maybe your priorities are a little screwed. I know you\u2019re busy, I know this crisis is important, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy, stop right there. You\u2019re making a big mistake.\u201d</p><p>He looks so impassive, I feel a surge of outrage. How dare he be so sure of himself all the time?</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re the one who\u2019s making a big mistake!\u201d The words burst out before I can stop them. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re the one who\u2019s letting your life pass by without engaging in it! Maybe Willow\u2019s right!\u201d</p><p>\u201c Excuse me?\u201d Sam looks thunderous at the mention of Willow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to miss out!

You\u2019re turning into stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStone?\u201d He gives a burst of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYes, stone. You\u2019ll wake up one day and you\u2019ll be a statue, but you won\u2019t know it. You\u2019ll be trapped inside yourself.\u201d My voice is wobbling; I\u2019m not sure why.

OK, on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re dealing with a crisis.\u201d I grab his arm fiercely. \u201cBut there\u2019s an old man waiting to hear from you, Sam. Longing to hear from you. For only five minutes. And you know what? I envy you.\u201d</p><p>Sam exhales sharply. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Poppy, you\u2019ve got this all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I?\u201d I stare up at him, feeling all my buried emotions starting to bubble. \u201cI just wish I had your chance. To see my dad. You don\u2019t know how lucky you are. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>A tear trickles down my cheek, and I brush it away brusquely.</p><p>Sam is silent. He puts his phone away and faces me square-on. When he speaks, his voice is gentle.</p><p>\u201cListen, Poppy. I can understand how you feel. I don\u2019t mean to trivialize family relationships. I have a very good relationship with my father, and I see him whenever I can. But it\u2019s not that easy, bearing in mind that he lives in Hong Kong.\u201d</p><p>I gasp with horror. Are they so out of touch? Did he not even know his father had moved back to this country?</p><p>\u201cSam!\u201d My words tumble out. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! He\u2019s moved back. He lives in Hampshire! He sent you an email. He wanted to see you. Don\u2019t you read anything ?\u201d</p><p>Sam throws back his head and roars with laughter, and I stare at him, affronted.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says at last, wiping his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s start from the beginning. Let\u2019s get this straight. You\u2019re talking about the email from David Robinson, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not! I\u2019m talking about the one from\u2014\u201d</p><p>I break off midstream, suddenly uncertain. Robinson? Robinson? I grab my phone and check the email address:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>I just assumed he was David Roxton. It seemed obvious he was David Roxton.</p><p>\u201cContrary to your assumptions, I did read that email,\u201d Sam is saying. \u201cAnd I chose to ignore it. Believe me, David Robinson is not my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he called himself Dad. \u201d I\u2019m totally bewildered. \u201cThat\u2019s what he wrote. Dad. Is he ... your stepdad? Your halfdad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my dad in any shape or form,\u201d says Sam patiently. \u201cIf you must know, when I was at college I hung out with a group of guys. He was one of them. David Andrew Daniel Robinson. D.A.D. Robinson. We called him Dad. OK? Got it, finally?\u201d</p><p>He starts walking toward the hotel as though the subject is closed, but I\u2019m rooted to the spot, my mind flitting around in shock. I can\u2019t get over this. Dad isn\u2019t Sam\u2019s dad? Dad is a friend ? How was I supposed to know that? People shouldn\u2019t be allowed to sign themselves as Dad unless they are your dad. It should be the law.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so stupid in all my life.</p><p>Except ... Except. As I\u2019m standing there, I can\u2019t help replaying all David Robinson\u2019s emails in my head.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time. I think of you often ... . Did you ever get any of my phone messages? Don\u2019t worry, I know you\u2019re a busy fellow ... . As I said, there is something I\u2019d love to talk to you about. Are you ever down Hampshire way?</p><p>OK. So maybe I got it wrong about Sam\u2019s father and the cottage and the faithful dog. But these words still touch a nerve in me. They sound so humble. So self-effacing. This David is clearly an old, old friend who wants to reach out. Maybe this is another relationship which Sam is leaving to wither. Maybe they\u2019ll see each other and the years will fall away and afterward Sam will thank me and tell me how he needs to value friendship more, he simply didn\u2019t realize it, and I\u2019ve transformed his life... .</p><p>Abruptly, I hurry after Sam and catch up with him.</p><p>\u201cSo, is he a good friend?\u201d I begin. \u201cDavid Robinson?

Does he realize how empty his life will be if he doesn\u2019t keep up with the people who were once important to him?</p> <p>\u201cSo, surely he\u2019s someone you still have a bond with! If you saw him, maybe you\u2019d rekindle that!

I thought you might like to get in touch with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in touch with him.\u201d Sam sounds exasperated. \u201cEvery year or so we meet for a drink, and it\u2019s always the same story. He has some new entrepreneurial project he needs investors for, usually involving some ridiculous product or pyramid scheme. If it\u2019s not fitness equipment, it\u2019s double-glazing or time-shares in Turkey. Against my better judgment I give him some money. Then the business folds and I don\u2019t hear from him again for another year. It\u2019s a ridiculous cycle I need to break. Which is why I blanked his email. I\u2019ll call him in a month or two, maybe, but right now, frankly, the last thing I need in my life is David bloody Robinson\u2014\u201d He breaks off and peers at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I gulp. There\u2019s no way round this. None.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you in the bar.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Sam hasn\u2019t turned into a statue quite yet. Because as we head into the hotel, he says nothing, but I can easily read his feelings on his face, the entire range of them: from anger, to fury, to frustration, to ...</p><p>Well. Back to anger again.82</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say yet again. \u201cI thought ... \u201d</p><p>I peter out. I\u2019ve already explained what I thought. It hasn\u2019t really helped, to be honest.</p><p>We push our way through the heavy double doors to see Vicks hurrying down the corridor toward us, holding a phone to her ear, struggling with a pile of stuff and looking harassed.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d she\u2019s saying as she nears us. \u201cMark, wait a minute. Just met Sam. I\u2019ll ring you back.\u201d She looks up and launches in with no niceties. \u201cSam, I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re going with the original statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sam\u2019s voice is so thunderous, I jump. \u201cYou have to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing on Ryan. No proof of anything untoward. There\u2019s no more time. I\u2019m sorry, Sam. I know you tried, but ... \u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a tense silence. Sam and Vicks aren\u2019t even looking at each other, but the body language is obvious. Vicks\u2019s arms are now wrapped defensively around her laptop and a mass of papers. Sam is kneading both fists into his forehead.</p><p>Personally, I\u2019m trying to blend into the wallpaper.</p><p>\u201cVicks, you know this is bollocks.\u201d Sam sounds as though he\u2019s trying hard to control his impatience. \u201cWe know what happened. What, we ignore all this new information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not information, it\u2019s guesswork! We don\u2019t know what happened!\u201d Vicks looks up and down the empty corridor and lowers her voice. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get a statement out to ITN, pronto, we are sitting fucking ducks, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have time,\u201d he says mutinously. \u201cWe can talk to this guy Ryan. Interview him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long will that take? What will that achieve?\u201d Vicks puts a hand to her head. \u201cSam, these are grave accusations. They have no substance. Unless we find some solid proof ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we stand back. We wash our hands. They win.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice is calm, but I can tell he\u2019s simmering with rage.</p><p>\u201cThe techies are still investigating in London.\u201d Vicks sounds weary. \u201cBut unless they find proof ... \u201d She glances at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s coming up to nine. Jesus. We have no time, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me speak to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d She sighs. \u201cNot here. We\u2019ve moved to a bigger room with a Skype screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They both start walking briskly along, and I follow, not sure if I should or not.

That\u2019s David Robinson. That guy with curly, receding dark hair and a pale-gray metallic suit, which he\u2019s accessorized with a black shirt and white leather tie.

What am I supposed to do, drink here on my own?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m feeling worse and worse. I\u2019ve totally landed Sam in this. I have to do something about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a drink with you!\u201d I chime in hurriedly. \u201cSam, you go. I\u2019ll entertain David. I\u2019m Poppy Wyatt, hi!\u201d I thrust my hand out and try not to wince at his clammy touch. \u201cGo.\u201d I meet eyes with Sam. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Sam hesitates a moment, then nods. \u201cThanks. Use the company tab.\u201d Already he and Vicks are hurrying away.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d David seems a bit unsure how to react. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine thing! Some people get a bit too big for their boots, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very busy at the moment,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cI mean really busy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo where do you fit in? Sam\u2019s PA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I\u2019ve kind of been helping Sam out. Unofficially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnofficially.\u201d David gives a great big wink. \u201cSay no more. All on expenses. Got to look kosher.\u201d</p><p>OK, now I get it: This man is a nightmare. No wonder Sam spends his life avoiding him.</p><p>\u201cWould you like another drink?\u201d I say as charmingly as I can. \u201cAnd then maybe you could tell me what you do. Sam said you were an investor? In ... fitness equipment?\u201d</p><p>David scowls and drains his glass. \u201cI was in that line for a while. Too much health and safety, that\u2019s the problem with that game. Too many inspectors. Too many namby-pamby rules. Another double whiskey, if you\u2019re buying.\u201d</p><p>I order the whiskey and a large glass of wine for myself, rigid with mortification. I still can\u2019t believe how wrong I called this. I am never interfering in anyone\u2019s emails ever, ever again.</p><p>\u201cAnd after fitness equipment?\u201d I prompt him. \u201cWhat did you do then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d David Robinson leans back and cracks his knuckles. \u201cThen I went down the self-tanning route ... \u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, my mind is numbed. Is there any business this man hasn\u2019t been in? Each story seems to follow the same pattern. The same phrases have been rolled out every time. Unique opportunity, I mean, unique, Poppy ... serious investment ... on the brink ... megabucks, I mean, megabucks, Poppy ... events outside my control ... damn stupid banks ... shortsighted investors ... bloody regulation ...</p><p>There\u2019s been no sign of Sam. No sign of Vicks. Nothing in my phone. I\u2019m almost beside myself with tension, wondering what\u2019s going on. Meanwhile, David has sunk two whiskeys, torn into three packets of crisps, and is now scooping up a dish of hummus with taco chips.</p><p>\u201cInterested in children\u2019s entertainment, are you, Poppy?\u201d he suddenly says.</p><p>Why would I be interested in children\u2019s entertainment?</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say politely, but he ignores me. He\u2019s produced a brown furry animal glove puppet from his briefcase and is dancing it round the table.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wombat. Goes down a storm with the kids. Want to have a go?\u201d</p><p>No, I do not want to have a go. But, in the interests of keeping the conversation going, I shrug. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what to do with a glove puppet, but David seems galvanized as soon as I have it on my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural! You take these along to a kids\u2019 party, playground, whatever, they fly. And the beauty is the profit margin. Poppy, you would not believe it.\u201d He smacks the table. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s flexible. You can sell them around your daytime job. I\u2019ll show you the whole kit... .\u201d He reaches into his briefcase again and produces a plastic folder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stare at him in bewilderment. What does he mean, sell them? He surely doesn\u2019t mean ...</p><p>\u201cHave I spelled your name right?\u201d He looks up from writing on the folder, and I gape at it. Why is he writing my name on the front of a folder entitled Mr. Wombat Official Franchise Agreement ?</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019d do is take a small consignment at first. Say ... a hundred units.\u201d He waves a hand airily. \u201cYou\u2019ll sell that in a day, easy. Especially with our new free gift, Mr. Magical.\u201d He places a plastic wizard on the table and twinkles at me. \u201cThe next step is the exciting one.

I\u2019m not doing this!\u201d</p> <p>David doesn\u2019t even seem to hear me. \u201cLike I say, it\u2019s totally flexible. It\u2019s all profit, direct to you, into your pocket\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any profit in my pocket!\u201d I lean across the bar table. \u201cI don\u2019t want to join! Thanks anyway!\u201d For good measure I take his pen and cross through Poppy Wyatt on the folder, and David flinches as though I\u2019ve wounded him.</p><p>\u201cWell! No need for that! Just trying to do you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it.\u201d I try to sound polite. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have time to sell wombats. Or ... \u201d I pick up the wizard. \u201cWho\u2019s this? Dumbledore?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all so random. What\u2019s a magician got to do with a wombat, anyway?</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d David seems mortally offended. \u201cIt\u2019s not Dumbledore. This is Mr. Magical. New TV series. Next big thing. It was all lined up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been temporarily canceled,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a very exciting product. Versatile, unbreakable, popular with both girls and boys. I could let you have five hundred units for ... two hundred pounds?\u201d</p><p>Is he nuts?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any plastic wizards,\u201d I say as politely as I can. \u201cThanks anyway.\u201d A thought suddenly crosses my mind. \u201cHow many of these Mr. Magicals have you got, then?\u201d</p><p>David looks as though he doesn\u2019t want to answer the question. At last he says, \u201cI believe my current stock is ten thousand,\u201d and takes a glug of whiskey.</p> <p>Ten thousand? Oh my God. Poor David Robinson. I feel quite sorry for him now. What\u2019s he going to do with ten thousand plastic wizards? I dread to ask how many wombats he\u2019s got.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Sam will know someone who wants to sell them,\u201d I say encouragingly. \u201cSomeone with children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d David raises his eyes lugubriously from his drink. \u201cTell me something. Does Sam still blame me for flooding his house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t mentioned it,\u201d I say honestly.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe the damage wasn\u2019t as bad as it looked. Bloody Albanian fish tanks.\u201d David looks downcast. \u201cAbsolute tat. And the fish weren\u2019t much better. Word of advice, Poppy: Steer clear of fish.\u201d</p><p>I have an urge to giggle and bite my lip hard.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I nod as seriously as I can. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>He polishes off the last taco chip, exhales noisily, and looks around the lobby. Uh-oh. He seems to be getting restless. I can\u2019t let him go wandering around.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what was Sam like at college?\u201d I ask, to spin out the conversation a little more.</p><p>\u201cHighflier.\u201d David looks a little grouchy. \u201cYou know the type. Rowed for the college. Always knew he\u2019d end up doing well. Went off the rails a bit in his second year. Got in a bit of trouble. But that was understandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d I frown, not following,</p><p>\u201cWell, you know.\u201d David shrugs. \u201cAfter his mum died.\u201d</p><p>I freeze, my glass halfway to my lips. What did he just say?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I\u2019m trying\u2014not very well\u2014to conceal my shock. \u201cDid you say Sam\u2019s mother died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d David seems surprised. \u201cBeginning of the second year. Heart disease, I think it was. She\u2019d not been well, but no one was expecting her to peg it so soon. Sam took it badly, poor bloke. Though I always say to him, you\u2019re welcome to my old lady, any time you want ... \u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not listening. My head is buzzing with confusion. He said it was a friend of his. I know he did. I can hear him now: My friend lost his mother when we were at college. I spent a lot of nights talking with him. Lot of nights ... . And it never goes away ... .</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d David is waving his hand in front of my face. \u201cYou all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d I try to smile. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just ... I thought it was a friend of his who lost his mother. Not Sam himself. I must have got confused. Silly me. Um, do you want another whiskey?\u201d</p><p>David doesn\u2019t reply to my offer. He\u2019s silent awhile, then shoots me an appraising look, cradling his empty drink in his hands. His fleshy thumbs are tracing a pattern on the glass, and I watch them, mesmerized.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t confused,\u201d he says at last. \u201cSam didn\u2019t tell you, did he? He said it was a friend.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, taken aback. I\u2019d written this guy off as a boorish moron. But he\u2019s totally nailed it.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admit at last. \u201cHe did. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s private like that, Sam.\u201d David nods. \u201cWhen it happened\u2014the death\u2014he didn\u2019t tell anyone at college for days. Only his two closest friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I hesitate doubtfully. \u201cIs that ... you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe!\u201d David gives a short, rueful laugh. \u201cNo, not me. I\u2019m not in the inner sanctum. It\u2019s Tim and Andrew. They\u2019re his right-hand men. All rowed in the same boat together. Know them?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p> <p>\u201cJoined at the hip, even now, those three guys are. Tim\u2019s over at Merrill Lynch; Andrew\u2019s a barrister in some chambers or other. And of course Sam\u2019s pretty close to his brother, Josh,\u201d David adds. \u201cHe\u2019s two years older. Used to come and visit. Sorted Sam out when things went wrong for him. Spoke to his tutors. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know Sam had a brother either. As I sit there, digesting all this, I feel a bit chastened. I\u2019ve never even heard of Tim or Andrew or Josh. But then, why would I have heard of them? They probably text Sam directly. They\u2019re probably in touch like normal people. In private. Not like Willow the Witch and old friends trying to hustle some money.</p><p>All this time I\u2019ve thought I could see Sam\u2019s entire life. But it wasn\u2019t his entire life, was it? It was one in-box. And I judged him on it.</p><p>He has friends. He has a life. He has a relationship with his family. He has a whole load of stuff I have no idea about. I was an idiot if I thought I\u2019d got to know the whole story. I know a single chapter. That\u2019s all.</p><p>I take a swig of wine, numbing the strange wistfulness that suddenly washes over me. I\u2019ll never know all of Sam\u2019s other chapters. He\u2019ll never tell me and I\u2019ll never ask. We\u2019ll part ways and I\u2019ll just have the impression I\u2019ve already got. The version of him that lives in his PA\u2019s in-box.</p><p>I wonder what impression he\u2019ll have of me. Oh God. Better not go there.</p> <p>The thought makes me snort with laughter, and David eyes me curiously.</p><p>\u201cFunny girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d My phone buzzes and I pull it to me, not caring if I\u2019m rude. It\u2019s telling me I have a voice mail from Magnus.</p><p>Magnus?</p><p>I missed a call from Magnus?</p><p>Abruptly my thoughts swoop away from Sam, away from David and this place, to the rest of my life. Magnus. Wedding. Anonymous text. Your fianc\u00e9e has been unfaithful ... . Jumbled thoughts pile into my brain all at once, as though they\u2019ve been clamoring at the door. I leap to my feet, pressing voice mail, jabbing at the keys, impatient and nervous all at once. Although what am I expecting? A confession? A rebuttal? Why would Magnus have any idea that I received an anonymous message?</p><p>\u201cHey, Pops!\u201d Magnus\u2019s distinctive voice is muffled by a background thump of music. \u201cCould you call Professor Wilson and remind her I\u2019m away? Thanks, sweets. Number\u2019s on my desk. Ciao! Having a great time!\u201d</p><p>I listen to it twice over for clues, even though I have no idea what kind of clues I\u2019m hoping to glean.83 As I ring off, my stomach is churning. I can\u2019t bear it. I don\u2019t want this. If I\u2019d never got that text message, I\u2019d be happy now. I\u2019d be looking forward to my wedding and thinking about the honeymoon and practicing my new signature. I\u2019d be happy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve run out of conversational gambits, so I kick off my shoes, draw my feet up onto the bench, and hug my knees morosely. I\u2019m aware that around us, in the bar, the White Globe Consulting employees have started to cluster. I can hear snatches of low, anxious conversation, and I\u2019ve caught the word memo a few times. The news must be seeping out. I glance at my watch and feel a clench of alarm. It\u2019s 9:40 p.m. Only twenty minutes till the ITN bulletin.</p><p>For the millionth time I wonder what Vicks and Sam are up to. I wish I could help. I wish I could do something. I feel powerless sitting out here\u2014\u201cOK!\u201d A sharp female voice interrupts my thoughts, and I look up to see Willow standing in front of me, glaring down. She\u2019s changed into a halter-neck evening dress, and even her shoulders are twitchy. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you this straight, and I hope you\u2019ll answer it straight. No games. No playing around. No little tricks.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s practically spitting the words at me.

It\u2019s as though they\u2019re emblazoned on her face.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she bristles at me. \u201cJust tell me that. Who are you? And if you won\u2019t tell me, then believe me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Poppy,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Poppy.\u2019 \u201d She sounds deeply suspicious, as though Poppy must be my invented escort-agency name.</p><p>\u201cHave you met David?\u201d I add politely. \u201cHe\u2019s an old university friend of Sam\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d At these words I can see interest flash across her features. \u201cHello, David, I\u2019m Willow.\u201d Her gaze swivels to focus on him, and I swear I feel a cooling on my face.</p><p>\u201cCharmed, Willow. Friend of Sam\u2019s, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Willow.\u201d She says it with slightly more emphasis.</p><p>\u201cNice name.\u201d He nods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Willow. Willow. \u201d There\u2019s an edge to her voice now. \u201cSam must have mentioned me. Wi-llow. \u2019</p><p>David wrinkles his brow thoughtfully. \u201cDon\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201d She looks as though she\u2019s going to expire with outrage. \u201cI\u2019m with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now you\u2019re not, are you?\u201d says David jovially\u2014then shoots me a tiny wink.</p> <p>I\u2019m actually warming to this David. Once you get past the bad shirt and the dodgy investments, he\u2019s OK.</p><p>Willow looks incandescent. \u201cThis is just ... The world is going insane,\u201d she says, almost to herself. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, but you know her ?\u201d She jerks a thumb at me.</p><p>\u201cI assumed she was Sam\u2019s special lady,\u201d says David innocently.</p><p>\u201cHer? You? \u201d</p><p>Willow\u2019s eyeing me up and down in a disbelieving, supercilious sort of way that nettles me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not me?\u201d I say robustly. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t he be with me?\u201d</p><p>Willow says nothing for a moment, just blinks very fast. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. He\u2019s two-timing me,\u201d she murmurs at last, her voice throbbing with intensity. \u201cThe truth finally comes out. I should have known it. It explains ... a lot.\u201d She exhales sharply, her fingers raking through her hair. \u201cSo where do we go now?\u201d She addresses some unknown audience. \u201cWhere the fuck do we go now?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s a total fruit loop. I want to burst out laughing. Where does she think she is, acting in her own private stage play? Who does she think is impressed by her performance?</p> <p>And she\u2019s missed a crucial fact. How can Sam be two-timing her if she\u2019s not his girlfriend ?</p><p>On the other hand, as much as I\u2019m enjoying winding her up, I don\u2019t want to spread false rumors.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was with him,\u201d I clarify. \u201cI said, \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t he be with me?\u2019 Are you Sam\u2019s girlfriend, then?\u201d</p><p>Willow flinches but doesn\u2019t answer, I notice.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d She rounds on me again. \u201cYou appear in my life, I have no idea who you are or where you came from ... \u201d</p><p>She\u2019s playing to the gallery again. I wonder if she went to drama school and got chucked out for being too melodramatic.84</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ... complicated.\u201d</p><p>The word complicated seems to inflame Willow even more.</p><p>\u201cOh, \u2018complicated.\u2019 \u201d She makes little jabby quote gestures. \u201c \u2018Complicated.\u2019 Wait a minute.\u201d Her eyes suddenly narrow to disbelieving slits as she surveys my outfit. \u201cIs that Sam\u2019s shirt?\u201d</p><p>Ah. A-ha-ha. She\u2019s really not going to like that. Maybe I won\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cIs that Sam\u2019s shirt? Tell me right now!\u201d Her voice is so hectoring and abrasive, I flinch. \u201cAre you wearing Sam\u2019s shirt? Tell me! Is that his shirt? Answer me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own Brazilian!\u201d The words fly out of my mouth before I can stop them. Oops.</p><p>OK. The trick when you\u2019ve said something embarrassing by mistake is not to overreact. Instead, keep your chin up and pretend nothing happened. Maybe Willow didn\u2019t even notice what I said. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t notice. Of course she didn\u2019t.</p><p>I dart a surreptitious look at her, and her eyes have widened so much, I think her eyeballs might pop out. All right, so she did notice. And from David\u2019s gleeful expression, it\u2019s clear he did too.</p><p>\u201cI mean ... business,\u201d I amend, clearing my throat. \u201cBusiness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over David\u2019s shoulder I suddenly see Vicks.

Quarter to ten.</p><p>\u201cVicks!\u201d Willow has noticed her too. She blocks Vicks\u2019s way, her arms folded imperiously. \u201cWhere\u2019s Sam?

I\u2019ll be discreet. I swear.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a beat of silence, then Vicks nods. \u201cOK. We ran out of time. I guess you could say Sam lost.\u201d</p><p>I feel a plunge of disappointment. After all that.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Sam say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a lot. He stormed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen to Sir Nicholas?\u201d I speak as quietly as I can.</p><p>Vicks doesn\u2019t reply, but her head turns away as though she wants to escape that particular thought.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she says abruptly. \u201cLet me know if you hear from Sam. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>I wait as Vicks walks away, then casually raise my head. Sure enough, Willow is fixated on me, like a cobra.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I smile back pleasantly, just as Willow\u2019s eyes land on my left hand. Her mouth opens. For an instant she seems incapable of speech.</p> <p>\u201cWho gave you that ring?\u201d she utters at last.</p><p>What bloody business is it of hers?</p><p>\u201cA girl called Lucinda,\u201d I say, to wind her up. \u201cI\u2019d lost it, you see. She gave it back.\u201d</p><p>Willow draws breath and I swear she\u2019s about to launch her fangs into me, when Vicks\u2019s voice comes blasting through the PA system at top volume.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt the party, but I have an important announcement to make. All employees of White Globe Consulting, please make your way back into the main conference hall immediately. That\u2019s back into the main conference hall, immediately.

I\u2019ve got a great opportunity for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d I nod seriously. \u201cThanks.\u201d I watch him disappear toward the exit, then carefully put his card away for Sam.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Willow looms in front of me again, arms folded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start from the beginning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious ?\u201d I can\u2019t hide my exasperation. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something else you need to be doing right now?\u201d I gesture at the crowds surging into the conference room.</p><p>\u201cOh, nice try.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even flicker. \u201cI\u2019m hardly going to make some tedious corporate announcement my priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, this tedious corporate announcement is one you\u2019re going to want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know all about it, I suppose,\u201d Willow shoots back sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod, suddenly feeling despondent. \u201cI know all about it. And ... I think I\u2019m going to get a drink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stalk away to the bar. I can see Willow in the mirror, and after a few seconds she turns and heads toward the conference room, her expression mutinous. I feel drained just from talking to her.</p><p>No, I feel drained by the whole day. I order myself a large glass of wine, then slowly walk toward the conference room. Vicks is standing on the stage, talking to a rapt, shocked audience. Behind her, the massive screen is on silent TV.</p><p>\u201c ... as I say, we don\u2019t know exactly what shape the report will take, but we have made our response, and that\u2019s the only thing we can do at the present time. Are there any questions? Nihal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sir Nicholas now?\u201d comes Nihal\u2019s voice from the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Berkshire. We\u2019ll have to see what happens about the rest of the conference. As soon as any decisions have been made, obviously you will all be informed.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m looking around at the faces. Justin is a few feet away from me, gazing up at Vicks in a pantomime of shock and concern. Now he raises his hand.</p><p>\u201cJustin?\u201d says Vicks reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cVicks, bravo.\u201d His smooth voice travels through the room. \u201cI can only imagine how difficult these last few hours have been for you. As a member of the senior management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your sterling efforts. Whatever Sir Nicholas may or may not have said, whatever the truth of the matter\u2014and of course none of us can really know that\u2014your loyalty to the company is what we value. Well done, Vicks!\u201d He leads a round of applause.</p><p>Ooh. Snake. Clearly I\u2019m not the only one to think this, because another hand shoots straight up.</p> <p>\u201cMalcolm!\u201d says Vicks in plain relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to make it clear to all employees that Sir Nicholas did not make these remarks.\u201d Unfortunately, Malcolm\u2019s voice is a bit rumbly and I\u2019m not sure everyone can hear. \u201cI received the original memo he sent, and it was completely different\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to interrupt you now,\u201d Vicks chimes in. \u201cThe bulletin\u2019s starting. Volume up, please.\u201d</p><p>Where\u2019s Sam? He should be here. He should be replying to Justin and crushing him. He should be watching the bulletin. I just don\u2019t get it.</p><p>The familiar ITN News at Ten music begins, and the swirling graphics fill the massive screen onstage. I\u2019m feeling ridiculously nervous, even though it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me. Maybe they won\u2019t run the story, I keep thinking. You hear about items being bumped all the time... .</p><p>Big Ben\u2019s chimes have begun. Any second they\u2019ll start announcing the headlines. My stomach clenches with nerves, and I take a swig of wine. Watching the news is a completely different experience when it\u2019s something to do with you. This is what prime ministers must feel like all the time. God, I wouldn\u2019t be them for anything. They must spend every evening hiding behind the sofa, peering through their fingers.</p> <p>Bong! \u201cFresh attacks in the Middle East lead to fears of instability.\u201d Bong! \u201cHouse prices make a surprise recovery\u2014but will it last?\u201d Bong! \u201cA leaked memo casts doubts on the integrity of a top government adviser.\u201d</p><p>There it is. They\u2019re running it.</p><p>There\u2019s an almost eerie silence in the room. No one has gasped or even reacted. I think everyone\u2019s holding their breath, waiting for the full item. The Middle Eastern report has started and there are pictures of gunfire in a dusty street, but I\u2019m barely taking it in. I\u2019ve pulled out my phone and am texting Sam.</p><p>Are you watching? Everyone is in conference room. P</p><p>My phone remains silent. What\u2019s he doing? Why isn\u2019t he in here with everyone else?</p><p>I stare fixedly at the screen as the footage changes to house-price graphs and an interview with a family trying to move to Thaxted, wherever that is. I\u2019m willing the presenters to speak more quickly, to get through it. Never have I been less interested in house prices in my life.85</p><p>And then both the first two items are done and we\u2019re back in the studio and the newsreader is saying, with her grave face on:</p><p>\u201cTonight, doubts were cast on the integrity of Sir Nicholas Murray, the founder of White Globe Consulting and government adviser. In a confidential memo obtained exclusively by ITN, he refers to corrupt practices and the soliciting of bribes, apparently condoning them.\u201d</p> <p>There are a few gasps and whispers around the room. I glance at Vicks. Her face is amazingly composed as she watches the screen. I suppose she knew what to expect.</p><p>\u201cBut in a new twist, within the last few minutes ITN has discovered that another staff member at White Globe Consulting may in fact have written the words credited to Sir Nicholas, something which official company sources deny all knowledge of. Our reporter Damian Standforth asks: Is Sir Nicholas a villain\u2014or the victim of a smear attempt?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c What? \u2019 Vicks\u2019s voice rips across the room. \u201cWhat the fuck \u2014\u201d</p><p>A babble has broken out, interspersed with \u201cShh!\u201d and \u201cListen!\u201d and \u201cShut up!\u201d Someone has ramped the sound to top volume.

But even I\u2019d say that you don\u2019t phone up ITN with a story of a smear without something to back it up.</p> <p>How</p><p>As I start typing, I realize I don\u2019t even know how to frame the question, so I send it as it is. There\u2019s silence for a little while\u2014then a two page text arrives in my phone.</p><p>I blink at it in amazement. This is the longest text Sam has ever sent me, by approximately 2,000 percent.</p><p>I went on the record. I stand by what I said. Tomorrow I give them an exclusive interview about original memo, directors washing hands of Nick, everything. It\u2019s a stitch-up. Corporate spin has gone too far. The true story needs to be out there. Wanted Malcolm to join me but he won\u2019t. He has three kids. Can\u2019t risk it. So it\u2019s just me.</p><p>My head is buzzing. Sam\u2019s put himself on the line. He\u2019s turned into a whistle-blower. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s done something so extreme. But at the same time ... I can.</p><p>That\u2019s a pretty big deal.</p><p>I have no idea what else to type. I\u2019m in a state of shock.</p><p>Someone had to have the guts to stand by Nick.</p> <p>I stare at his words, my brow crinkled, thinking this through.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t prove anything though, surely? It\u2019s only your word.</p><p>A moment later he replies:</p><p>Raises question mark over story. That\u2019s enough. Where are you now?</p><p>In conference hall.</p><p>Anyone know you\u2019re texting me?</p><p>Vicks is talking volubly to some guy while holding a phone to her ear. She happens to look my way, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s my expression, but her eyes narrow a smidgen. She glances at my phone, then at my face again. I feel a dart of apprehension.</p><p>Don\u2019t think so. Yet.</p><p>Can you get away without anyone noticing?</p><p>I count to three, then casually scan the room as though I\u2019m interested in the light fittings. Vicks is in my peripheral vision. Now she\u2019s gazing straight at me. I lower my phone out of sight and text:</p><p>Where are you exactly?</p><p>Outside.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t help much.</p><p>All I\u2019ve got. No idea where I am.</p><p>A moment later another one arrives:</p><p>It\u2019s dark, if that\u2019s a clue. Grass underfoot.</p><p>Are you in big trouble?</p><p>There\u2019s no reply. I guess that\u2019s a yes.</p><p>OK. I won\u2019t look at Vicks. I will simply yawn, scratch my nose\u2014yes, good, unconcerned\u2014turn on my heel, and move behind this group of people. Then I\u2019ll duck down behind this big fat pillar.</p><p>Now I\u2019ll peek out.</p><p>Vicks is looking around with a frustrated expression. People are trying to get her attention, but she\u2019s batting them away. I can almost see the calculation in her eyes\u2014how much brain space does she allocate the strange girl who might know something but might also be a red herring?</p><p>Within five seconds I\u2019m in the corridor. Ten seconds, through the deserted lobby, avoiding the eye of the disconsolate-looking barman. He\u2019ll be getting enough business in a minute. Fifteen seconds, I\u2019m outside, ignoring the doorman, running over the gravel drive, round the corner, until grass is underfoot and I feel as though I\u2019ve got away.</p><p>I walk slowly, waiting for my breath to return. I\u2019m still in shock over what\u2019s just happened.</p><p>Are you going to lose your job over this?</p><p>Another silence. I walk a little more, adjusting to the night sky, the cool air with a little breeze, the soft grass. The hotel is a good four hundred yards away by now, and I start to unwind.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>He sounds quite relaxed about the fact. If a one-word text can sound relaxed.86</p><p>I\u2019m outside now. Where should I head?</p><p>God knows.

Sam Roxton typed a smiley face! A moment later he sends a follow-up.</p><p>I know. I don\u2019t believe it either.</p> <p>I laugh out loud, then shiver as a breeze hits my shoulders. This is all very well. But I\u2019m standing in a field in Hampshire with no coat and no idea where I\u2019m going or what I\u2019m doing. Come on, Poppy. Focus. There\u2019s no moon, and all the stars must be hidden behind clouds. I can hardly see to type.</p><p>Where ARE you? In the wood? Can\u2019t see a thing.</p><p>Through the wood. Other side. I\u2019ll meet you.</p><p>Cautiously, I start picking my way through the trees, cursing as a bramble catches my leg. There are probably stinging nettles and snake pits. There are probably man traps. I reach for my phone, trying to text and avoid brambles at the same time.</p><p>My new rule for life. Don\u2019t go into spooky dark woods on your own.</p><p>There\u2019s silence a moment\u2014then my phone bleeps.</p><p>You\u2019re not on your own.</p><p>I clutch the phone more tightly. It\u2019s true; with him on the other end, I do feel secure. I walk on a bit more, nearly tripping over a tree root, wondering where the moon\u2019s got to. Waxing, I suppose. Or waning. Whichever.</p><p>Look for me. I\u2019m coming.</p><p>I peer at his text in disbelief. Look for him? How can I look for him?</p><p>It\u2019s pitch-black. Hadn\u2019t you noticed?</p><p>My phone. Look for the light. Don\u2019t call out. Someone might hear.</p><p>I peer into the gloom. I can\u2019t see anything at all except the dark shadows of trees and looming mounds of bramble bushes. Still, I guess the worst that can happen is I fall off a cliff and break all my limbs. I take another few steps forward, listening to my own padding footsteps, breathing in the musky, damp air.</p><p>OK?</p><p>Still here.</p><p>I\u2019ve reached a tiny clearing and I hesitate, biting my lip. Before I go on, I want to say the things I won\u2019t be able to when I see him. I\u2019ll be too embarrassed. It\u2019s different by text.</p><p>Just wanted to say I think you\u2019ve done an amazing thing. Putting yourself on the line like that.</p><p>It had to be done.</p><p>That\u2019s typical of him to brush it off.</p><p>No. It didn\u2019t. But you did it.</p><p>I wait a little while, feeling the breeze on my face and listening to an owl hooting above me somewhere\u2014but he doesn\u2019t reply. I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m going to press on. I have to say these things, because I have a feeling no one else will.</p><p>You could have taken an easier path.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>But you didn\u2019t.</p><p>That\u2019s my rule for life.</p><p>And with no warning I feel a hotness behind my eyes. I have no idea why. I don\u2019t know why I suddenly feel affected. I want to type I admire you, but I can\u2019t bring myself to. Not even by text. Instead, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, I type:</p><p>I understand you.</p><p>Of course you do. You\u2019d do the same.</p><p>I stare at the screen, discomfited. Me ?

With a snuffle of laughter, I type an even longer row of kisses.</p><p>Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><p>Xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo</p><p>Xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox</p><p> xxx xxx xxx</p> <p>I see you.</p><p>I peer through the gloom again, but he must have better eyesight than I do, because I can\u2019t see anything.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Coming.</p><p>I lean forward, craning my neck, squinting for a glimpse of light, but there\u2019s nothing.

This is the moment that it would be natural to swivel round and greet him. Call out a hello; wave my phone in the air.</p><p>But my feet are rooted to the spot. I can\u2019t bring myself to move. Because as soon as I do, it will be time to be polite and matter-of-fact and back to normal. And I can\u2019t bear that. I want to stay here. In the place where we can say anything to each other. In the magic spell.</p><p>Sam pauses, right behind me. There\u2019s an unbearable fragile beat as I wait for him to shatter the quiet. But it\u2019s as though he feels the same way. He says nothing. All I can hear is the gentle sound of his breathing. Slowly, his arms wrap round me from behind. I close my eyes and lean back against his chest, feeling unreal.</p><p>I\u2019m standing in a wood with Sam and his arms are around me and they really shouldn\u2019t be. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this.</p><p>Except ... I do. Of course I do. Because as his hands gently cup my waist, I don\u2019t make a sound. As he swivels me around to face him, I don\u2019t make a sound. And as his stubble rasps my face, I don\u2019t make a sound. I don\u2019t need to. We\u2019re still talking. Every touch he makes, every imprint of his skin is like another word, another thought, a continuation of our conversation. And we\u2019re not done yet. Not yet.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re there. Five minutes, maybe. Ten minutes.</p><p>But the moment can\u2019t last forever, and it doesn\u2019t. The bubble doesn\u2019t so much burst as evaporate, leaving us back in the real world. Realizing our arms are round each other; awkwardly stepping apart; feeling the chill night air rush between us. I look away, clearing my throat, rubbing his touch off my skin.</p><p>\u201cSo, shall we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>As we pad through the woods, neither of us speaks. I can\u2019t believe what just happened. Already it seems like a dream. Something impossible.</p><p>It was in the forest. No one saw it or heard it. So did it actually happen?.87</p><p>Sam\u2019s phone is buzzing and this time he takes it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cHi, Vicks.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, it\u2019s over. At the edge of the wood I can see a posse of people striding over the grass toward us. And the aftermath begins. I must be a little dazed from our encounter, because I can\u2019t engage with any of this. I\u2019m aware of Vicks and Robbie and Mark all raising their voices, and Sam staying calm, and Vicks getting near to tears, which seems a bit unlikely for her, and talk of trains and cars and emergency press briefings and then Mark saying, \u201cIt\u2019s Sir Nicholas for you, Sam,\u201d and everyone moving back a step, almost respectfully, as Sam takes the call.</p><p>And then suddenly the cars are here to take everyone back to London, and we\u2019re heading out to the drive and Vicks is bossing everyone around and everyone\u2019s going to regroup at 7:00 a.m. at the office.</p><p>I\u2019ve been allotted to a car with Sam. As I get in, Vicks leans in and says, \u201cThanks, Poppy.\u201d I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s being sarcastic or not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d I say, just in case she\u2019s not. \u201cAnd ... I\u2019m sorry. About\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d she says tightly.</p><p>And then the car moves off. Sam is texting intently, a deep frown on his face. I don\u2019t dare make a sound. I check my phone for a message from Magnus, but there\u2019s nothing. So I drop it down on the seat and stare out the window, letting the streetlamps blur into a stream of light, wondering where the hell I\u2019m going.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d fallen asleep.</p> <p>But somehow my head is on Sam\u2019s chest and he\u2019s saying, \u201cPoppy? Poppy?\u201d Suddenly I wake up properly, and my neck is cricked and I\u2019m looking out of a car window at a funny angle.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I scramble to a sitting position, wincing as my head spins. \u201cSorry. God. You should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Is this your address?\u201d</p><p>I peer blearily out the window. We\u2019re in Balham. We\u2019re outside my block of flats. I glance at my watch. It\u2019s gone midnight.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say in disbelief. \u201cThis is me. How did you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Sam nods at my phone, still on the car seat. \u201cYour address was in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I can hardly complain about him invading my privacy.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course. That\u2019s fine.\u201d I nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Sam picks up the phone and seems about to hand it to me\u2014then he hesitates.</p><p>\u201cI read your messages, Poppy. All of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d I clear my throat, unsure how to react. \u201cWow. Well. That\u2019s ... that\u2019s a bit much, don\u2019t you think? I mean, I know I read your emails, but you didn\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lucinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him dumbly.</p><p>\u201cFor my money. Lucinda\u2019s your girl.\u201d</p><p>Lucinda?</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2014Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been lying to you. Consistently. She couldn\u2019t have been in all the places she says she has at the times she\u2019s said. It\u2019s not physically possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually ... I noticed that too,\u201d I admit. \u201cI thought she was trying to bill me for more hours or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes she bill by the hour?\u201d</p><p>I rub my nose, feeling stupid. In fact, she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s an all\u2013inclusive fee.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever noticed that Magnus and Lucinda inevitably texts you within ten minute of each other?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, I shake my head. Why would I notice that? I get zillions of texts every day, from all kinds of people. And, anyway, how did he notice?</p><p>\u201cI started off life as an analyst.\u201d He looks a bit abashed. \u201cThis is my kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your kind of thing?\u201d I say, puzzled.</p><p>Sam produces a piece of paper and I clap a hand over my mouth. I don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s drawn a chart. Times and dates. Calls. Texts. Emails. Has he been doing this while I\u2019ve been asleep?</p><p>\u201cI analyzed your messages. You\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>He analyzed my messages. How do you analyze messages?</p><p>He hands me the paper and I blink at it.</p><p>\u201cWhat ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see the correlation?\u201d</p><p>Correlation. I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about. It sounds like something from math exams.</p><p>\u201cUm ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cTake this date.\u201d He points at the paper. \u201cThey both email at around six p.m. asking how you\u2019re doing, being chatty. Then at eight p.m. Magnus tells you he\u2019s working late at the London Library, and a few minutes later Lucinda tells you she\u2019s working on garters for the bridesmaids at a fashion warehouse in Shoreditch. At eight at night? Please.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m silent for a few moments. I remember that email about the garters now. It seemed a bit odd, even at the time. But you can\u2019t jump to conclusions from one weird email, surely?</p><p>\u201cWho asked you to analyze my messages, anyway?\u201d I know I sound all prickly, but I can\u2019t help it. \u201cWho said it was any of your business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. You were asleep.\u201d He spreads his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just started looking idly and then a pattern built up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo emails aren\u2019t a pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only two.\u201d He gestures at the paper. \u201cNext day, Magnus has a special evening seminar which he \u201cforgot\u201d to mention. Five minutes later, Lucinda tells you about a lace workshop in Nottinghamshire. But she was in Fulham two hours earlier. Fulham to Nottinghamshire? In the rush hour? That\u2019s not real. My guess is it\u2019s an alibi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The word alibi makes me feel a bit cold.</p><p>\u201cTwo days later, Magnus texts you, canceling your lunch date. A moment later, Lucinda emails you, telling you she\u2019s frantically busy till two p.m. She doesn\u2019t give you any other reason for emailing. Why would she need to let you know that she\u2019s frantically busy over some random lunchtime?\u201d</p><p>He looks up, waiting for a reply. Like I\u2019ll have one.</p><p>\u201cI ... I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>As Sam continues, I knead my eyes briefly with my fists. I get why Vicks does this now. It\u2019s to block the world out, for just a second. Why didn\u2019t I see this? Why didn\u2019t I see any of this?</p><p>Magnus and Lucinda. It\u2019s like a bad joke. One of them\u2019s supposed be organizing my wedding. The other\u2019s supposed to be in my wedding. To me.</p><p>But wait. My head jerks with a thought. Who sent me the anonymous text? Sam\u2019s theory can\u2019t be right, because someone must have sent that. It wouldn\u2019t have been any of Magnus\u2019s friends, and I don\u2019t know any of Lucinda\u2019s friends, so who on earth ...</p><p>\u201cRemember when Magnus told you he had to counsel some PhD student? And Lucinda pulled out of your drinks meeting? She sent Clemency along instead? If you look at the timings ... \u201d</p><p>Sam\u2019s still talking, but I can barely hear him. My heart has constricted. Of course. Clemency.</p> <p>Clemency.</p><p>Clemency is dyslexic. She would have spelled fianc\u00e9 wrong. She would have been too terrified of Lucinda to give her name. But she would have wanted me to know. If there was something to know.</p><p>My fingers are shaking as I grab my phone and find the text again. Now that I read it over, I can hear the words in Clemency\u2019s sweet, anxious voice. It feels like her. It sounds like her.</p><p>Clemency wouldn\u2019t invent something like that. She must believe it\u2019s true. She must have seen something ... heard something ...</p><p>I sag back against the car seat. My limbs are aching. I feel parched and worn out and a little like I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d Sam seems to realize I\u2019ve stopped listening. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a theory, that\u2019s all.\u201d He folds the paper up and I take it.</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Thanks for doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... \u201d He shrugs, a bit awkward. \u201cLike I said. It\u2019s my thing.\u201d</p><p>For a while we\u2019re both silent, although it feels like we\u2019re still communicating. I feel as though our thoughts are circling above our heads, interweaving, looping, meeting for a moment, then diverging again. Him on his path, me on mine.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I exhale at last. \u201cI should let you go. It\u2019s late. Thanks for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he interrupts. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Thank you. \u201d</p><p>I nod simply. I think both of us are probably too drained to get into long speeches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I look up and make the mistake of catching his eye, silvered in the light from the streetlamp. And just for a moment I\u2019m transported\u2014</p><p>No. Don\u2019t, Poppy. It never happened. Don\u2019t think about it. Blank it.</p><p>\u201cSo. Um.\u201d I reach for the door handle, trying to force myself into reality, into rationality. \u201cI still need to give you this phone back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? Have it, Poppy. It\u2019s yours.\u201d He clasps my fingers over it and holds them tight for a moment. \u201cYou earned it. And please don\u2019t bother to forward anything else. As from tomorrow all my emails will go to my new PA. Your work here is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks!\u201d I open the door\u2014then on impulse turn around. \u201cSam ... I hope you\u2019re OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He flashes his wonder smile, and I suddenly feel like hugging him tight. He\u2019s about to lose his job and he can still smile like that. \u201cI hope you\u2019re OK,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about ... it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be OK!\u201d I give a brittle laugh, even though I have no idea what I mean by this. My husband-to-be is possibly shagging my wedding planner. In what sense will I be OK?</p><p>The driver clears his throat, and I start. It\u2019s the middle of the night. I\u2019m sitting in a car on the street. Come on, Poppy. Get with it. Move. The conversation has to end.</p><p>So, even though it\u2019s the last thing I feel like doing, I force myself to get out, bang the door shut, and call, \u201cGood night!\u201d I head to my front door and open it, because I know instinctively that Sam won\u2019t drive away till he\u2019s seen I\u2019m safely in. Then I stand on the doorstep, watching his car drive away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As it rounds the corner, I check my phone, half-hoping, half-expecting ...</p><p>But it\u2019s dark and silent.

I know.</p><p>82 Not such a huge range, then.</p> <p>83 Magnus is doing it with Professor Wilson? No. Surely not. She has a beard.</p><p>84 And, by the way, in what sense have I appeared in her life?</p><p>85 And we\u2019re not exactly starting from a high bar.</p><p>86 I think it can. It\u2019s all in the timing.</p><p>87 Another one for Antony. Not.</p> <p>13</p><p>It\u2019s in every single paper the next morning. Front-page news. I headed out to the newsagents as soon as I was up and bought every newspaper they had.</p><p>There are pictures of Sir Nicholas, pictures of the prime minister, pictures of Sam, pictures of Ed Exton, even a picture of Vicks in the Mail. The headlines are full of corruption and smear attempt and integrity. The memo is printed in full, everywhere, and there\u2019s an official quote from Number 10 about Sir Nicholas considering his position on the government committee. There are even two different cartoons of Sir Nicholas holding bags labeled Happiness and stuffed full of money.</p><p>But Sam was right: There\u2019s an air of confusion about it. Some journalists obviously think Sir Nicholas did write the memo. Others obviously think he didn\u2019t. One paper has run an editorial about how Sir Nicholas is an arrogant bighead and of course he\u2019s been taking bribes all along; another has written that Sir Nicholas is known for his quiet integrity and it couldn\u2019t possibly be him. If Sam wanted to throw up a question mark over everything, he\u2019s definitely succeeded.</p><p>I texted him this morning:</p><p>You OK?</p> <p>But I got no reply. I guess he\u2019s busy. To say the least.</p><p>Meanwhile, I feel like a wreck. It took me hours to get to sleep last night, I was so wired\u2014but then I woke at six and sat bolt upright, already grabbing for my phone, my heart racing. Magnus had texted four words:</p><p>Having great time. M xxx</p><p>Having a great time. What does that tell me? Nothing.</p><p>He could be having a great time congratulating himself on how I have no idea about his secret mistress. There again, he could be having a great time innocently looking forward to a life of faithful monogamy, with no idea that Clemency somehow got the wrong end of the stick about him and Lucinda.88 Or possibly he could be having a great time deciding that he\u2019s never going to be unfaithful again and regrets it hugely and will confess everything to me as soon as he gets back.89</p><p>I can\u2019t cope. I need Magnus to be here, in this country, in this room. I need to ask him, \u201cHave you been unfaithful with Lucinda?\u201d and see what he says, and then maybe we can move forward and I can work out what I\u2019m going to do. Until then, I feel like I\u2019m in limbo.</p><p>As I go to make another cup of tea, I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror, and I wince. My hair is a mess. My hands are covered with newsprint from reading all the papers. My stomach is full of acid, and my skin looks drawn. So much for my bridal beauty regimem. According to my plan, last night I was supposed to apply a hydration mask. I didn\u2019t even take my makeup off.</p><p>I\u2019d originally set today aside to do wedding preparation\u2014but every time I even think about it, my insides clench and I feel like crying or shouting at someone. (Well, Magnus.) There\u2019s no point just sitting here all day though. I have to go out. I have to do something. After a few sips of tea, I decide to go in to work. I don\u2019t have any appointments, but I\u2019ve got some admin I can catch up with. And at least it\u2019ll force me to have a shower and get myself together.</p> <p>I\u2019m the first to arrive, and I sit in the quiet calm, sorting through patient files, letting the monotony of the job soothe me. Which lasts about five minutes before Angela slouches through the door and clatters around, starting her computer and making coffee and turning on the wall-mounted telly.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to?\u201d I feel as if I\u2019ve got a hangover, even though I hardly drank anything last night, and I could do without this blaring in my ears. But Angela stares at me as though I\u2019ve violated some basic human right.</p><p>\u201cI always watch Daybreak. \u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not worth arguing. I could always heft all the files into my appointment room, but I don\u2019t have the energy for that either, so I just hunch my shoulders and try to block the world out.</p><p>\u201cParcel!\u201d Angela dumps a Jiffy bag in front of me. \u201cStarBlu. Is that your swimwear for the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>I stare at it blankly. I was a different person when I ordered that. I can remember myself now, going online one lunchtime, picking out bikinis and wraps. Never in a million years did I think that three days before the wedding I\u2019d be sitting here, wondering if the whole thing should go ahead at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c ... and in today\u2019s front-page story, we\u2019re talking possible corruption at government level.\u201d The presenter\u2019s voice attracts my attention. \u201cHere in the studio, a man who has known Sir Nicholas Murray for thirty years: Alan Smith-Reeves. Alan, this is a confusing business. What\u2019s your take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that guy,\u201d Angela says self-importantly, as Alan Smith-Reeves starts talking. \u201cHe used to work in the same building as my last job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I nod politely, as a picture of Sam appears on the screen.</p><p>I can\u2019t look. Just the sight of him sends shooting pains through my chest, but I don\u2019t even know why. Is it because he\u2019s in trouble? Is it because he\u2019s the only other person who knows about Magnus? Is it because last night I was standing in a wood with his arms around me and now I\u2019ll probably never see him again?</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite good-looking,\u201d says Angela, squinting at Sam critically. \u201cIs he Sir Nicholas Whatsit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, more vehemently than I meant to. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d She scowls at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t answer. I have to escape from all this. I get to my feet. \u201cWant a coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making one. Duh.\u201d Angela shoots me an odd look. \u201cAre you OK? What are you doing here, anyway? Thought you had the day off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to get ahead with stuff.\u201d I grab my denim jacket. \u201cBut maybe it was a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere she is!\u201d The door bursts open and Ruby and Annalise bustle in. \u201cWe were just talking about you!\u201d says Ruby, looking surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d do some admin. But I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go! Wait a sec.\u201d Ruby grabs my shoulder, then turns to Annalise. \u201cNow, Annalise. Why don\u2019t you say to Poppy what we were talking about? Then you won\u2019t have to write a letter.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. She\u2019s wearing her headmistressy look. And Annalise\u2019s looking shamefaced. What\u2019s going on?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it.\u201d Annalise bites her lip like a six-year-old. \u201cI\u2019ll write a letter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay it. Then it\u2019s done.\u201d Ruby is eyeing Annalise with the kind of stern gaze that\u2019s impossible to ignore.</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d Annalise takes a breath, looking a little pink around the cheeks. \u201cPoppy, I\u2019m sorry I behaved badly with Magnus the other day. It was wrong of me and I was just doing it to get back at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d prompts Ruby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve given you a hard time. Magnus is yours, not mine. He belongs with you, not me. And I\u2019m never going to mention the fact we switched appointments again,\u201d she finishes in a rush. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>She looks so discomfited, I feel quite touched. I can\u2019t believe Ruby did that. They should put her in charge at White Globe Consulting. She\u2019d sort out Justin Cole in no time.</p><p>\u201cWell ... thanks,\u201d I say. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly am sorry, you know, Poppy.\u201d Annalise twists her fingers, looking abject. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spoil your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnalise, take it from me. You won\u2019t spoil my wedding.\u201d I smile, but to my horror I can feel tears welling up in my eyes.</p> <p>If anything spoils my wedding it\u2019ll be the fact that it was called off. It\u2019ll be the fact that Magnus didn\u2019t really love me after all. It\u2019ll be the fact that I was a completely stupid, deluded fool ...</p><p>Oh God. I am going to cry.</p><p>\u201cMissus?\u201d Ruby gives me a close look. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I exclaim, blinking furiously.</p><p>\u201cWedding stress,\u201d says Annalise. \u201cOh my God, Poppy, are you turning into a bridezilla at last? Go on! I\u2019ll help. I\u2019ll be a bridesmaidzilla. Let\u2019s go and throw a hissy fit somewhere. That\u2019ll cheer you up.\u201d</p><p>I raise a half smile and wipe my eyes. I don\u2019t know how to respond. Do I tell them about Magnus? They\u2019re my friends, after all, and I\u2019m longing for someone to talk to.</p><p>But then, what if it is all a mix-up? I haven\u2019t heard anything further from Unknown Number.90 The whole thing\u2019s guesswork. I can\u2019t start telling the world that Magnus has been unfaithful, based on one anonymous text. And then have Annalise putting it on Facebook and calling him a love rat and booing as we walk down the aisle.91</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cSlap-up breakfast!\u201d exclaims Ruby. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cI won\u2019t fit into my dress!\u201d</p><p>Assuming I\u2019m still going to get married. I feel the rush of tears again. Preparing for a wedding is stressful enough. Preparing for a wedding or possible last-minute breakup/cancelation is going to turn my hair gray.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Ruby contradicts me. \u201cEveryone knows brides lose two dress sizes before their wedding. You\u2019ve got a massive margin to play with there, girl. Use it! Pig out! You\u2019ll never be in this position again!\u201d</p><p>\u201c Have you dropped two dress sizes?\u201d asks Annalise, eyeing me a little resentfully. \u201cYou can\u2019t have.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say gloomily. \u201cMaybe half of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that qualifies you for a latte and a doughnut, at any rate,\u201d says Ruby, heading for the door. \u201cCome on. Comfort food\u2019s what you need. We\u2019ve got half an hour. Let\u2019s cram it in.\u201d</p><p>When Ruby gets an idea, she goes for it. She\u2019s already striding along the pavement and into the Costa two doors away. As Annalise and I push our way in, she\u2019s heading up to the till.</p><p>\u201cHello there!\u201d she begins cheerfully. \u201cI\u201cd like three lattes, three doughnuts, three plain croissants, three almond croissants\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuby, stop!\u201d I start giggling.</p> <p>\u201cThree pains au chocolat\u2014we\u2019ll give them to the patients if we can\u2019t finish them\u2014three apple muffins\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree tins of breath mints,\u201d chimes in Annalise.</p><p>\u201cBreath mints?\u201d Ruby turns to regard her scornfully. \u201cBreath mints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some cinnamon swirls,\u201d Annalise adds hurriedly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Three cinnamon swirls ... \u201d</p><p>My phone rings in my pocket, and my stomach lurches. Oh God, who\u2019s this? What if it\u2019s Magnus?</p> <p>What if it\u2019s Sam?</p><p>I haul it out, taking a step away from Ruby and Annalise, who are arguing about what kind of cookies they should buy. As I see the screen, I feel a dreadful squeezing sensation inside. It\u2019s Unknown Number. Whoever-it-is has finally phoned me back.</p><p>This is it. This is where I find out the truth. For good or for bad. I\u2019m so petrified, my hand is actually shaking as I press accept, and at first I can\u2019t catch my breath to speak.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d a girl\u2019s voice is saying down the line. \u201cHello? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Is that Clemency? I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I manage to utter at last. \u201cHello. This is Poppy speaking. Is this Clemency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The girl sounds surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I swallow. \u201cRight.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not Clemency? Who is it, then? My mind is scampering around frantically. Who else could have sent me that text? Does this mean Lucinda\u2019s not involved after all? I can see Annalise and Ruby eyeing me curiously from the register and I swing away.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I try desperately to sound dignified and not at all like someone who\u2019s about to be totally humiliated and have to call their entire wedding off. \u201cWas there something you wanted to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m urgently trying to get in touch with Sam Roxton.\u201d</p><p>Sam?</p><p>The tension that\u2019s been growing inside me breaks with a crash. It\u2019s not Unknown Number after all. At least, it\u2019s Different Unknown Number. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m disappointed or relieved.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this number?\u201d the girl is demanding. \u201cDo you know Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr ... yes. Yes, I do.\u201d I try to gather myself. \u201cSorry. I misunderstood for a moment. I thought you were someone else. Can I take a message for Sam?\u201d</p><p>I say it automatically before I realize that I\u2019m not forwarding things to Sam anymore. Still, I can get a message to him, can\u2019t I? Just for old times\u2019 sake. Just to be helpful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried that.\u201d She sounds quite high-handed. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I need to speak to him. Today. Now. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I can give you his email address\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a joke.\u201d She cuts me off impatiently. \u201cSam never reads emails. But, believe me, this is important. I have to speak to him, as soon as possible. It\u2019s about the phone, in fact. The phone you\u2019re holding right now.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I gape at the receiver, wondering if I\u2019ve gone crazy. How does some strange girl know what phone I\u2019m holding?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I say in astonishment, and she heaves a sigh.</p><p>\u201cNo one remembers who I am, do they? I worked for Sam. I\u2019m Violet.\u201d</p><p>Thank God I didn\u2019t eat the cinnamon swirls, is all I can say. Violet turns out to be about ten feet tall, with skinny legs clad in frayed denim shorts and massive dark eyes with traces of makeup around them.92 She looks like a cross between a giraffe and a bush baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It turned out that she lives in Clapham and it would take her only about five minutes to get here to see me. So here she is, in Costa, chomping on a chicken wrap and swigging a smoothie. Ruby and Annalise have gone back to work, which is a good thing, because I couldn\u2019t cope with having to explain the whole saga to them. It\u2019s all too surreal.</p><p>As Violet has told me several times, if she hadn\u2019t happened to be in London, between jobs, and happened to see the headlines as she went to get a pint of milk, she would never have known about the scandal. And if she hadn\u2019t happened to have a brain in her head, she wouldn\u2019t have realized that she totally knew what had been going on the whole time. But are people grateful? Do they want to hear? No. They\u2019re all idiots.</p><p>\u201cMy parents are on this stupid cruise, \u201d she\u2019s saying with disdain. \u201cI tried to look in their telephone book, but I don\u2019t know who\u2019s who, do I? So I tried ringing Sam\u2019s line, then Nick\u2019s line ... but I only got snotty PAs. No one would listen to me. But I need to tell someone.\u201d She bangs her hand on the table. \u201cBecause I know something was going on. I even sort of knew it at the time? But Sam never listened to me? Do you find he never listens to you?\u201d She focuses on me with interest for the first time. \u201cWho exactly are you, anyway? You said you\u2019d been helping him. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of complicated,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cHe was left in the lurch a bit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d She takes another bite of chicken wrap and regards me with interest. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>Has she forgotten?</p><p>\u201cWell ... er ... you left with no notice. Remember? You were supposed to be his PA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiiiight.\u201d She opens her eyes wide. \u201cYeah. That job didn\u2019t really work out for me. And the agency called and wanted me to get on a plane, so ... \u201c Her brow wrinkles in thought as though she\u2019s considering this for the first time. \u201cI guess he was a bit pissed off. But they\u2019ve got loads of staff. He\u2019ll be all right.\u201d She waves her hand airily. \u201cSo, do you work there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d How am I going to explain it? \u201cI found this phone and borrowed it, and I got to know Sam that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI remember that phone. Yeah.\u201d She peers at it, screwing up her nose. \u201cI never answered it.\u201d</p><p>I suppress a smile. She must have been the crappest PA in the world.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s why I know something was going on.\u201d She finishes off her chicken wrap with a flourish. \u201cBecause of all the messages. On that.\u201d She jabs a finger at it.</p><p>OK. At last we\u2019re getting to it.</p><p>\u201cMessages? What messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had all these voice mails on it. Not for Sam; for some guy called Ed. I didn\u2019t know what to do about them. So I listened to them and I wrote them down. And I didn\u2019t like the sound of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d My heart starts to thud.</p><p>\u201cThey were all from the same guy, about altering a document. How they were going to do it. How long it would take. How much it would cost. That kind of thing. It didn\u2019t sound right, you know what I mean? But it didn\u2019t exactly sound wrong either.\u201d She crinkles her nose. \u201cIt just sounded ... weird.\u201d</p><p>My head is wheeling. I can\u2019t take this in. Voice mails for Ed about the memo. On this phone. This phone.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent him an email and he said ignore them. But I didn\u2019t want to ignore them. You know what I mean? I had this instinct.\u201d She swigs her smoothie. \u201cThen I open the paper this morning, and I see Sam talking about some memo and saying it must have been sexed up, and I think, yes!\u201d She bangs her hand on the table again. \u201c That\u2019s what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many voice mails were there in all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour? Five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there aren\u2019t any voice mails on here now. At least, I haven\u2019t found any.\u201d I can hardly bear to ask the question. \u201cDid you ... delete them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d She beams in triumph. \u201cThat\u2019s the point! I saved them. At least, my boyfriend, Aran, did. I was writing one out one night, and he was, like, \u2018Babe, just save it to the server.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018How do I save a voice mail ?\u2019 So he came into the office and put them all on a file. He can do amazing stuff, Aran,\u201d she adds proudly. \u201cHe\u2019s a model too, but he writes games on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA file?\u201d I\u2019m not following. \u201cSo where\u2019s the file now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must still be there.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cOn the PA\u2019s computer.

There was just a big old pile of crap I was supposed to wade through.\u201d</p><p>I almost want to laugh hysterically. All that panic. All that effort. We could have simply gone to the computer outside Sam\u2019s office.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m going to the States tomorrow, and I had to tell someone, but it\u2019s impossible to get in touch with Sam at the moment.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019ve tried emailing, texting, phoning\u2014I\u2019m, like, if you only knew what I had to tell you ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me have a go,\u201d I say after a pause, and type a text to Sam.</p><p>Sam, you have to call me. Now. It\u2019s about Sir Nicholas. Could be a help. Not a time-waster. Believe me. Call at once. Please. Poppy.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck with that.\u201d Violet rolls her eyes. \u201cLike I told you, he\u2019s gone off radar. His PA said he\u2019s not responding to anybody. Not emailing, not answering calls\u2014\u201d She breaks off as the tinny sound of Beyonc\u00e9 comes through the air. Sam Mobile has already popped up on the display.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Her eyes widen. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p> <p>I press accept and lift the receiver to my ear. \u201cHi, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy.\u201d</p><p>His voice feels like a blast of sunshine in my ear. There\u2019s so much I want to say. But I can\u2019t. Not now.</p><p>Maybe not ever.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d I say. \u201cAre you in your office? Go to your PA\u2019s computer. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s the briefest pause, then he says, \u201cOK.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook on the desktop,\u201d I instruct him. \u201cIs there a file called Voice Mails ?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a little while\u2014then Sam\u2019s voice comes down the phone.</p><p>\u201cAffirmative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d My breath comes out in a whoosh. I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding it. \u201cYou need to look after that file carefully. And now you need to speak to Violet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet?\u201d He sounds taken aback. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean Violet my flaky ex-PA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with her now. Listen to her, Sam. Please.\u201d I pass the phone over.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam,\u201d says Violet easily. \u201cSorry about leaving you in the lurch and all that. But you\u2019ve had Poppy to help you out, yeah?\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019s talking, I head up to the counter and buy myself another coffee, even though I\u2019m so wired I probably shouldn\u2019t. Hearing Sam\u2019s voice has thrown me. I immediately wanted to talk to him about everything. I wanted to nestle up and hear what he had to say.</p> <p>But that\u2019s impossible. Number one, because he\u2019s mired in massive problems of his own. Number two, because who is he? Not a friend. Not a colleague. Just some random guy who has no place in my life. It\u2019s over. The only place for us to go from here is goodbye.</p><p>Maybe we\u2019ll exchange the odd text. Maybe we\u2019ll meet up awkwardly in a year\u2019s time. Both of us will look different and we\u2019ll say hello stiltedly, already regretting the decision to come. We\u2019ll laugh about how bizarre that whole phone business was. We\u2019ll never mention what happened in the woods. Because it didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cYou OK, Poppy?\u201d Violet is standing in front of me, waving the phone in front of my face. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I come to and take it. \u201cThanks. Did you speak to Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe opened the file as I was talking to him. He\u2019s pretty stoked. He said to say he\u2019d call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well ... he doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d I pick up my coffee. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, nice rock.\u201d Violet grabs my hand.93 \u201cIs that an emerald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool! So, who\u2019s the lucky guy?\u201d She gets out an iPhone. \u201cCan I take a picture of it? I\u2019m just getting ideas for when Aran becomes a gazillionaire. Did you choose it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he had it already when he proposed. It\u2019s a family ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRomantic.\u201d Violet nods. \u201cWow. So you didn\u2019t expect it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you like, \u2018Fuck!\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of.\u201d I nod.</p><p>It seems a million years ago now, that evening when Magnus proposed. I was so giddy. I felt as if I\u2019d entered a magic bubble where everything was shiny and perfect and nothing could ever go wrong again.

Moments I haven\u2019t wanted to see, that I\u2019ve tried to blank out. Magnus flirting with girls at parties. Magnus surrounded by all his female students, his arms casually draped around their shoulders. Magnus being practically molested by Annalise.</p><p>The thing is, girls like Magnus. And he likes them.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, staring into my coffee. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you have any idea who he\u2019s doing it with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d Violet seems galvanized. \u201cConfront the situation. Have you spoken to him? Have you spoken to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in Bruges, on his stag do. I can\u2019t talk to him. And she\u2019s\u2014\u201d I break off. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t.

She\u2019s probably totally innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s on his stag do?\u201d says Violet, raising her eyebrows, then grins. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just winding you up.\u201d She pushes my arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is. Hey, babe, I have to go and pack. Hope it all works out for you. Give my love to Sam.\u201d</p> <p>As she strides out of the coffee shop, about six male heads turn. I\u2019m pretty sure that if Magnus were here, his would be one of them.</p><p>I stare morosely into my coffee for a little while. Why do people have to keep telling me to confront the situation? I do confront things. Loads of times. But it\u2019s not like I can march up to Magnus on his stag do, or accost Lucinda and accuse her out of the blue. I mean, you need evidence. You need facts. One anonymous text doesn\u2019t cut it.</p><p>My phone starts emitting Beyonc\u00e9 and I stiffen, in spite of myself. Is that\u2014</p><p>No. It\u2019s Unknown Number.

I had a bit of a fright, but it\u2019s all fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd such a valuable ring too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say soothingly. \u201cNo harm done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I still can\u2019t understand it! One of the waitresses had handed it to me and I was going to put it in the safe, you see. That\u2019s what I was about to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, you don\u2019t have to explain.\u201d I feel quite sorry for her. \u201cThese things happen. It was a fire alarm, you got distracted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mrs. Fairfax sounds a mite offended. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened at all. I was about to put it in the safe, as I say. But before I could do so, another lady rushed up to me and told me it was hers. Another guest at the tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother guest?\u201d I say, after a puzzled pause.</p><p>\u201cYes! She said it was her engagement ring and that she\u2019d been frantically searching high and low. She was very credible. The waitress vouched for the fact that she\u2019d been sitting at the table. And then she put it on. Well, who was I to disbelieve her?\u201d</p><p>I rub my eyes, wondering if I\u2019m hearing this correctly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying someone else took my ring? And said it was hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! She was adamant that the ring belonged to her. She put it on straightaway and it fitted. It looked very nice, as it happens. I know that strictly speaking I should have asked her for proof that she was the owner, and we will be reviewing our official procedures in the light of this unfortunate occurrence\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fairfax.\u201d I cut her off, not remotely interested in official procedures. \u201cCan I just ask you\u2014did she have long dark hair, by any chance? And a little diamant\u00e9 hair band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Long dark hair, with a diamant\u00e9 hair band, as you say, and a wonderful orange dress.\u201d</p> <p>I close my eyes in disbelief. Lucinda. It was Lucinda.</p><p>The ring didn\u2019t get caught on her bag lining. She deliberately took it. She knew how panicked I\u2019d be. She knew how important it was. But she took it and pretended it was hers. God only knows why.</p><p>A pulse is beating in my head as I say goodbye to Mrs. Fairfax. I\u2019m breathing hard and my hands are balling into fists. Enough is enough. Maybe I don\u2019t have any evidence that she\u2019s sleeping with Magnus\u2014but I can sure as hell confront her about this. And I\u2019m going to do it right now.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what Lucinda\u2019s doing today. I haven\u2019t had any emails or messages from her for a couple of days, which is unusual. As I text, my hands are actually shaking.</p><p>Hi Lucinda! How\u2019s it going? What are you up to? Can I help? Poppy.</p> <p>Almost immediately she replies:</p><p>Just polishing off some loose ends at home. Don\u2019t worry, nothing for you to help with. Lucinda</p><p>Lucinda lives in Battersea. Twenty minutes away by taxi. I\u2019m not going to give her time to get her story straight. I\u2019m going to take her by surprise.</p><p>I hail a cab and give her address, then sit back, trying to stay calm and steely, even though the more I think about this, the more flabbergasted I feel. Lucinda took my ring. Does that mean she\u2019s a thief ? Did she make a copy and keep the real one and sell it? I glance at my left hand, suddenly doubtful. Am I so sure this is the real thing?</p><p>Or was she somehow meaning to be helpful? Did she forget she had it? Should I give her the benefit of the doubt\u2014</p><p>No, Poppy. No chance.</p> <p>As I arrive at her red-brick-mansion block, a guy in jeans is opening the main front door. I quickly dodge in behind him and head up the three flights of stairs to Lucinda\u2019s flat. This way she\u2019ll get absolutely no warning that I\u2019m here.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019ll open the door wearing the real ring, plus all the other jewelry she\u2019s stolen from unsuspecting friends. Maybe no one will answer, because she\u2019s actually in Bruges. Maybe Magnus will open the door dressed in a bedsheet\u2014</p><p>Oh God. Stop it, Poppy.</p><p>I rap on the door, trying to sound like a delivery guy. It must have worked, because she swings the door open, her face creased in annoyance, her phone to her ear, before stopping dead, her mouth in an O.</p><p>I stare back, equally wordless. My eyes flick past Lucinda, to the huge suitcase in the hall, then to the passport in her hand, and then back to the suitcase.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cTerminal Four. Thanks.\u201d She rings off and glares at me, as though daring me to ask what she\u2019s doing.</p><p>I\u2019m racking my brains for something inspired and caustic to say, but my inner five-year-old is quicker off the mark.</p><p>\u201cYou took my ring!\u201d As the words burst out, I can feel my cheeks turning pink, to add to the effect. Maybe I should stamp my foot too.</p> <p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake.\u201d Lucinda wrinkles her nose disparagingly, as though to accuse one\u2019s wedding planner of theft is a total etiquette no-no. \u201cYou got it back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you took it!\u201d I step inside her flat, even though she hasn\u2019t invited me to, and can\u2019t help glancing around. I\u2019ve never been to Lucinda\u2019s flat before. It\u2019s quite grand and has clearly been interior-decorated, but it\u2019s an absolute mess of cluttered surfaces and chairs, with wineglasses everywhere. No wonder she always wants to meet at hotels.</p><p>\u201cLook, Poppy.\u201d She sighs bad-temperedly. \u201cI\u2019ve got things to do, OK? If you\u2019re going to come around and make offensive remarks, then I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Huh?</p><p>She\u2019s the one who did something wrong. She\u2019s the one who took a priceless engagement ring and pretended it was hers. How has she managed to leapfrog over that fact and make it look like I\u2019m in the wrong for even mentioning it?</p><p>\u201cNow, if that\u2019s all, I am rather busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there.\u201d The force of my own voice takes me by surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s not all. I want to know exactly why you took my ring. Were you planning to sell it? Did you need the money?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t need the money.\u201d She glares at me. \u201cYou want to know why I took it, Miss Poppy?

Wh\u2014\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even finish the word, let alone the sentence.</p><p>\u201cYou know Magnus and I are old flames.\u201d She throws the information out casually, like a swatch of material on a table.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? No! No one ever told me that! Were you engaged?\u201d</p><p>My mind is juddering with shock. Magnus was with Lucinda? Magnus was engaged ? He never mentioned a previous fianc\u00e9e, let alone that it was Lucinda. Why don\u2019t I know any of this? What is going on ?</p><p>\u201cNo, we were never engaged,\u201d she says reluctantly, then shoots me a murderous look. \u201cBut we should have been. He proposed to me. With that ring.\u201d</p><p>I feel a clench of disbelieving pain. Magnus proposed to another girl with my ring ? With our ring ? I want to turn on my heel and leave, escape, block my ears ... but I can\u2019t. I have to get to the bottom of all this. Nothing seems to make sense.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t get it. You said you should have been engaged. What happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe bottled it, is what happened,\u201d she says furiously. \u201cThe bloody coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. At what stage? Had you planned the wedding? He didn\u2019t jilt you, did he?\u201d I say in sudden horror. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave you standing at the altar?\u201d</p><p>Lucinda has closed her eyes as though reliving it. Now she opens them and gives me a vicious glare.</p><p>\u201c Far worse. He chickened out halfway through the bloody proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I peer at her, not quite understanding. \u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were on a skiing holiday, two years ago.\u201d Her brow tightens in memory. \u201cI wasn\u2019t stupid, I knew he\u2019d brought the family ring. I knew he was going to propose. So we\u2019d had dinner one night, and it was just us in the chalet. The fire was going, and he knelt down on the rug and brought out this little box. He opened it up, and there was this amazing vintage emerald ring.\u201d</p> <p>Lucinda pauses, breathing hard. I don\u2019t move a muscle.</p><p>\u201cHe took hold of my hand, and he said, \u2018Lucinda, my darling, will you ... \u2019 \u201d She inhales sharply, as though she can hardly bear to carry on. \u201cAnd I was going to say yes! I was all poised! I was only waiting for him to get to the end. But then he stopped. He started sweating. And then he stood up and said, \u2018Bugger. Sorry. I can\u2019t do this. Sorry, Lucinda.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. I stare at her in disbelief, almost wanting to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI yelled, \u2018Do what, you prick? You haven\u2019t even bloody proposed yet!\u2019 \u201d But he didn\u2019t have anything to say. He closed up the box and put the ring away. And that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say lamely. \u201cThat\u2019s really awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a commitment-phobe, he couldn\u2019t even commit to a fucking proposal ! He couldn\u2019t even see that through!\u201d She looks absolutely livid, and I don\u2019t blame her.</p><p>\u201cSo, why on earth did you agree to organize his wedding?\u201d I say incredulously. \u201cIsn\u2019t that rubbing it in your face, every day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was the least he could do to make amends.\u201d She glowers at me. \u201cI needed a job. Although, actually, I\u2019m thinking of changing career. Arranging weddings is a bloody nightmare. \u201d</p><p>No wonder Lucinda\u2019s been in such a bad mood this whole time. No wonder she\u2019s been so aggressive toward me. If I had known for one second that she was an old flame of Magnus\u2019s ...</p><p>\u201cI was never going to keep the ring,\u201d she adds sulkily. \u201cI just wanted to give you a scare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you managed it, all right.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve let this woman into my life, confided in her, discussed all my hopes for my wedding day\u2014and she\u2019s an ex of Magnus. How could he have let this happen? How could he have thought it would ever work?</p><p>I feel like some kind of filter has been lifted from my eyes. I feel like I\u2019m finally waking up to reality. And I haven\u2019t even tackled my main fear yet.</p><p>\u201cI got the idea you were still sleeping with Magnus,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cI mean, not when you were going out together. Now. Recently. Last week.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence and I look up, hoping she\u2019ll launch into some stinging denial. But as I meet her eye, she turns away.</p><p>\u201cLucinda?\u201d</p><p>She grabs her suitcase and starts wheeling it toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m going away. I\u2019ve had enough of this whole thing. I deserve a holiday.

If you can\u2019t keep tabs on him, you shouldn\u2019t marry him.\u201d Her phone rings and she answers. \u201cHi. Yes. Coming down. Excuse me.\u201d She ushers me out of the flat, bangs the door, and double-locks it.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just leave !\u201d I\u2019m shaking all over. \u201cYou have to tell me what happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d She throws her hands up. \u201cThese things happen. You weren\u2019t meant to find out, but there you go.\u201d She manhandles her suitcase into the lift. \u201cOh, and by the way, if you think you and I are the only girls he\u2019s hauled that emerald ring out of the safe for, think again. We\u2019re on the end of a list, sweetie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m starting to hyperventilate. \u201cWhat list? Lucinda, wait! What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork it out, Poppy. It\u2019s your problem. I\u2019ve sorted the flowers and the order of service and the almonds and the fucking ... dessert spoons.\u201d She jabs a button and the lift doors start to close. \u201cThis one\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>88 OK, unlikely.</p><p>89 OK, even less likely.</p><p>90 Aka Clemency. Possibly.</p> <p>91 And if you think she wouldn\u2019t, you don\u2019t know Annalise.</p><p>92 Either this is a very arty look, like you see in fashion magazines, or she didn\u2019t take her makeup off yesterday. (Still. Like I can talk.)</p><p>93 No one\u2019s ever grabbed my hand to look at the ring before. That is definitely an invasion of personal space.</p><p>14</p><p>After Lucinda\u2019s gone, I stand motionless for about three minutes solid, in a state of shock. Then, abruptly, I come to. I head for the stairwell and down the stairs. As I step out of the building I switch off my phone. I can\u2019t afford any distractions. I need to think. I need to be alone. Like Lucinda said, I need to work this out for myself.</p><p>I start walking along the pavement, not caring which direction I\u2019m going. My mind is circling around all the facts, the guesses, the speculation, and back to the facts. But gradually, as I walk, thoughts seem to settle into place. My resolve hardens. I have a plan.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know where my sudden determination has come from: whether Lucinda has spurred me on or whether I\u2019ve just had enough of avoiding confrontation while my stomach ties itself up in knots. But I\u2019m going to face this one down. I\u2019m going to do it. The weirdest thing is, I keep hearing Sam\u2019s voice in my ear, reassuring me and bolstering me and telling me I can do it. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s giving me a pep talk, even though he\u2019s not here. And it\u2019s making me stand taller. It\u2019s making me feel like I can do this. I\u2019m going to be a Whole New Poppy.</p><p>As I reach the corner of Battersea Rise, I feel ready. I haul out my phone, turn it on, and, without reading a single new message, speed-dial Magnus. Of course he doesn\u2019t answer, but I expected that.</p><p>\u201cHi, Magnus,\u201d I say in the most crisp, businesslike tones I can muster. \u201cCan you call me as soon as possible? We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>OK. Good. That was dignified. A brief, cutting message that he will understand. Now ring off.</p><p>Ring off, Poppy.</p><p>But I can\u2019t. My hand feels welded to the phone. While I\u2019m connected to him, or even just to his voice mail, I can feel my defenses coming down. I want to talk. I want to hear from him. I want him to know how shocked and hurt I am.</p><p>\u201cBecause ... I\u2019ve heard some news, OK?\u201d I hear myself continuing. \u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to your great friend Lucinda. \u201d I give Lucinda an angry little emphasis. \u201cAnd what she told me was a bit of a shock, to say the least, so I think we need to talk as soon as possible. Because unless you\u2019ve got some great, marvelous explanation, which I can\u2019t think how you would, because was Lucinda lying ? Because someone must be lying, Magnus. Someone must be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Beep.</p> <p>Damn, I got cut off.</p><p>As I turn off my phone again, I\u2019m cursing myself. So much for the brief, cutting message. So much for a Whole New Poppy. That wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to go at all.</p><p>Still, never mind. At least I made the call. At least I didn\u2019t sit with my hands over my ears, avoiding the whole thing. And now to the next thing on my mental list. I step into the road, lift my hand, and flag down a cab.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say as I get in. \u201cI\u2019d like to go to Hampstead, please.\u201d</p><p>I know Wanda\u2019s in today, because she said she was preparing for some radio show she\u2019s doing tonight. And, sure enough, as I draw up to the house, music is blasting out of the windows. I have no idea if Antony is there too, but I don\u2019t care. They can both hear this. As I approach the house, I\u2019m trembling, like I was the other night\u2014but in a different way. In a positive way. In a bring-it-on way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d As Wanda swings the door open, she beams widely. \u201cWhat a lovely surprise!\u201d She swoops in for a kiss, then studies my face again. \u201cHave you just dropped round to be sociable, or was there anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a brief moment of silence between us. I can tell she understands that I don\u2019t mean a jolly chitchat.</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, come in!\u201d She smiles again, but I can see anxiety in the downward slant of her eyes and the faint crinkling of her mouth. She has a very expressive face, Wanda: Her English-rose skin is pale and fragile, like tissue paper, and the lines round her eyes crease in a myriad of different ways according to her mood. I guess that\u2019s what happens when you have no Botox, makeup, or fake tan. You have expressions instead. \u201cShall I put on some coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I follow her into the kitchen, which is about ten times as messy as it was when I was living here with Magnus. I can\u2019t help wrinkling my nose at a bad smell in the air\u2014which I guess is the bunch of flowers still in paper, gently rotting on the counter. A man\u2019s shoe is in the sink, along with a hairbrush, and there are huge piles of old cardboard folders on every chair.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Wanda gestures vaguely around as though hoping one of the chairs might magically clear itself. \u2019We were having a sort-out. To what extent does one archive? That\u2019s the question.\u201d</p><p>Once upon a time I would have hastily cast around for something intelligent to say about archives. But now I face her square-on and say bluntly, \u201cActually, there\u2019s something else I want to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d says Wanda after a pause. \u201cI rather thought there might be. Let\u2019s sit down.\u201d</p><p>She grabs a pile of folders off a chair, to reveal a large fish wrapped in fishmonger\u2019s paper. OK. So that was the smell.</p> <p>\u201c That\u2019s where that went. Extraordinary.\u201d She frowns, hesitates a moment, then puts the folders back on top of it. \u201cLet\u2019s try the drawing room.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on one of the bumpy sofas, and Wanda draws up an ancient needlepoint-embroidered chair opposite. The smell of old wood smoke, musty kilim, and potpourri is overwhelming. Golden light is streaming through the original stained-glass panels in the windows. This room is so Tavish. And so is Wanda. She\u2019s sitting in her usual uncompromising position, knees firmly apart, dirndl skirt draping around her legs, head tilted forward to listen, with her frizzy hennaed hair falling all around her face.</p><p>\u201cMagnus\u2014\u201d I begin, then immediately come to a halt.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagnus\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop again. There\u2019s silence for a moment.</p> <p>This woman is so significant in my life, but I barely know her. We\u2019ve had a completely civilized, distant relationship where we haven\u2019t talked about anything except things that don\u2019t matter. Now it feels like I\u2019m about to rip down the screen between us. But I don\u2019t know where to start. Words are buzzing around my head like flies. I need to catch one.</p><p>\u201cHow many girls has Magnus proposed to?\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to start there, but then, why not?</p><p>Wanda looks caught out. \u201cPoppy!\u201d She swallows. \u201cGoodness. I really think Magnus ... This is a matter ... \u201d She rubs her face, and I notice that her fingernails are filthy.</p><p>\u201cMagnus is in Bruges. I can\u2019t talk to him. So I\u2019ve come to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Wanda\u2019s expression becomes grave.</p><p>\u201cLucinda told me there\u2019s a list and she and I are at the end of it. Magnus never mentioned anyone else. He never even told me he and Lucinda used to be an item. Nobody told me.\u201d I can\u2019t keep the resentment out of my voice.</p><p>\u201cPoppy. You mustn\u2019t ... \u201d I can tell Wanda\u2019s floundering. \u201cMagnus is very, very fond of you, and you shouldn\u2019t worry about ... about that. You\u2019re a lovely girl.\u201d</p><p>She might be trying to be kind\u2014but the way she says it makes me flinch. What does she mean by \u201clovely girl\u201d? Is that some patronizing way of saying, \u201cYou may not have a brain but you look OK?\u201d</p> <p>I have to say something. I have to. It\u2019s now or never. Go, Poppy.</p><p>\u201cWanda, you\u2019re making me feel inferior.\u201d The words rush out. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m inferior, or is this just in my mind?\u201d</p><p>Argh. I did it. I can\u2019t believe I said that out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Wanda\u2019s eyes widen so far, I notice for the first time what a stunning periwinkle blue they are. I\u2019m taken aback by how shocked she seems, but I can\u2019t back down now.</p><p>\u201cI feel inferior when I\u2019m here.\u201d I swallow. \u201cAlways. And I just wondered if you really thought I was or ...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wanda has thrust both hands into her frizzy hair. She comes across a pencil, pulls it out, and absentmindedly puts it down on the table.</p><p>\u201cI think we both need a drink,\u201d she says at last. She heaves herself up out of the sagging chair and pours two glasses of scotch from a bottle in the cabinet. She hands one to me, raises her own, and takes a deep gulp. \u201cI feel a bit knocked for six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Immediately I feel bad.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She raises a hand. \u201cAbsolutely not! Dear girl! You do not have to apologize for a bona fide expression of your perception of the situation, be it construct or not.\u201d</p> <p>I have no idea what she\u2019s going on about. But I think she\u2019s trying to be nice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to me to apologize,\u201d she continues, \u201cif you have ever felt uncomfortable, let alone \u2018inferior.\u2019 Although this is such a ridiculous idea that I can barely ... \u201d She trails off, looking baffled. \u201cPoppy, I simply don\u2019t understand. May I just ask what has given you this impression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all so intelligent.\u201d I shrug uncomfortably. \u201cYou publish things in journals and I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Wanda looks perplexed. \u201cBut why should you publish things in journals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ... \u201d I rub my nose. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s ... like, I don\u2019t know how to pronounce Proust.\u201d</p> <p>Wanda looks even more baffled. \u201cYou clearly do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I do now! But I didn\u2019t. The first time I met you, I kept getting things wrong, and Antony said my physiotherapy degree was \u2018amusing,\u2019 and I felt so mortified\u2014\u201d I break off, my throat suddenly blocked.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d A light dawns in Wanda\u2019s eye. \u201cNow, you must never take Antony seriously. Didn\u2019t Magnus warn you? His sense of humor can be, shall we say, a little off? He\u2019s offended so many of our friends with misplaced jokes, I can\u2019t count.\u201d She raises her eyes briefly to heaven. \u201cHe is a dear man underneath it all, though, as you\u2019ll get to know.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t bring myself to reply so I take a gulp of my scotch. I never usually drink scotch, but this is hitting the spot. As I look up, Wanda\u2019s sharp eyes are on me.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, we\u2019re not the type to gush. But, believe me, Antony thinks as highly of you as I do. He would be devastated to hear of your anxieties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what was the row in the church all about?\u201d I fling the words at her furiously before I can stop myself. Wanda looks as though I\u2019ve slapped her.</p> <p>\u201cAh. You heard that. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d She takes another gulp of her scotch, looking stressed out.</p><p>Suddenly I\u2019m sick of being polite and talking around things. I want to cut to the chase.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I put my glass down. \u201cThe reason I\u2019ve come here is, it turns out Magnus has been sleeping with Lucinda. I\u2019m calling off the wedding. So you might as well be honest and say how much you hated me from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucinda?\u201d Wanda claps a hand over her mouth, looking aghast. \u201cOh, Magnus. That wretched, wretched boy. When will he learn?\u201d She seems absolutely deflated by this piece of news. \u201cPoppy, I\u2019m so sorry. Magnus is ... What can I say? A flawed individual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guessed he might do this?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cHas he done it before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid he might do something stupid,\u201d Wanda says after a pause. \u201cI\u2019m afraid whatever gifts Magnus inherited from us, the gift of commitment was not among them. That\u2019s why we were concerned about the wedding. Magnus has a history of leaping into romantic ventures, backtracking, changing his mind, making things messy for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he has done it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way.\u201d She winces. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve never got as far as the church before. There have been three previous fianc\u00e9es, and I gather Lucinda was an almost-fianc\u00e9e. When he announced yet again that he was marrying a girl we hardly knew, I\u2019m afraid we didn\u2019t rush to celebrate.\u201d She eyes me frankly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We did try to put him off the idea in the church, quite forcibly. We thought the two of you should spend a year getting to know each other better. The last thing we wanted was for you to be hurt by our son\u2019s idiocy.\u201d</p> <p>I feel dazed. I had no idea Magnus had proposed to anyone else, let alone four girls (including Lucinda\u2014half). How can this be? Is this my fault? Did I ever actually ask him about his past?</p><p>Yes. Yes! Of course I did. The memory comes back to me in a fully composed picture. We were lying in bed, after that dinner at the Chinese place. We told each other about all our old flames. And, OK, so I edited very slightly.94 but I didn\u2019t leave out four previous proposals. Magnus never said a word. Not a word. But everyone else knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, of course, all the odd looks and edgy voices between Antony and Wanda make sense. I was so paranoid. I assumed they were all about how crap I was.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me,\u201d I say, almost to myself. \u201cAnd I thought you were angry he\u2019d used the family ring, because ... I dunno. I wasn\u2019t worthy of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot worthy ?\u201d Wanda seems absolutely appalled. \u201cWho has put these ideas into your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the problem, then?\u201d I feel the old hurt rising again. \u201cI know you weren\u2019t happy about it, so don\u2019t pretend.\u201d</p> <p>Wanda appears to debate internally for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re being frank with each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Wanda sighs. \u201cMagnus has taken that family ring out of the bank\u2019s safe so many times now, Antony and I have developed our own private theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what?</p><p>\u201cThe family ring is so easy. \u201d She spreads her hands. \u201cIt requires no thought. He can do it on impulse. Our theory is that when he really wants to commit to someone, he\u2019ll find a ring for himself. He\u2019ll choose something carefully. Give it some thought. Perhaps even let his bride choose her own.\u201d She gives me a rueful smile. \u201cSo when we learned that he\u2019d used the family ring yet again, I\u2019m afraid alarm bells rang.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d</p><p>I twist the ring round my finger. It suddenly feels heavy and lumpish. I thought having a family ring was special. I thought it meant Magnus was more committed to me. But now I\u2019m seeing it as Wanda sees it. A thoughtless, easy, no-brainer choice. I cannot believe how everything I thought has been turned on its head. I cannot believe how I misinterpreted everything.</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d adds Wanda, a little despondently, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry things have ended like this. You\u2019re a lovely girl, Poppy. Great fun. I was looking forward to having you as a daughter-in-law.\u201d</p><p>I wait for my hackles to rise at the phrase great fun, for my internal prickliness to put in an appearance\u2014but somehow it doesn\u2019t. For the first time since I\u2019ve met Wanda, I\u2019m able to take her words at face value. By great fun she doesn\u2019t mean low IQ and inferior degree. She means great fun.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d I say\u2014and I\u2019m speaking the truth. I do feel sad. Just as I work Wanda out, it\u2019s all over.</p><p>I thought Magnus was perfect and his parents were my only problem. Now I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s the other way round. Wanda\u2019s great; shame about her son.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d I wrench the ring off and hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cPoppy!\u201d She looks startled. \u201cSurely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over. I don\u2019t want to wear it anymore. It belongs to you. To be honest, it never really felt like mine.\u201d I grab my bag and stand up. \u201cI think I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... \u201d Wanda seems bewildered. \u201cPlease don\u2019t rush into anything. Have you spoken to Magnus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I breathe out. \u201cBut it\u2019s kind of irrelevant. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s pretty much the end of the conversation. Wanda sees me to the door and presses my hand as I leave, and I feel a sudden rush of affection for her. Maybe we\u2019ll stay in touch. Maybe I\u2019ll lose Magnus but gain Wanda.</p><p>The massive front door closes, and I push my way through the overgrown rhododendrons, down the path to the gate. I\u2019m expecting to crumble into tears any moment. My perfect fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t perfect after all. He\u2019s a lying, unfaithful, commitment-phobic flake. I\u2019m going to have to call off a whole wedding. My brothers won\u2019t get to walk me up the aisle after all. I should be in bits. But as I walk down the hill, all I can feel is numb.</p><p>I can\u2019t face the tube. Nor can I afford any more taxis. So I head toward an out-of-the-way bench in a patch of sunshine, sit down, and stare blankly into space for a while. Random thoughts are floating around my brain, bouncing off one another as though in zero gravity.</p> <p>So much for all that ... . I wonder if I\u2019ll be able to sell my wedding dress .... I should have known it was too good to be true ... . I must tell the vicar ... . I don\u2019t think Toby and Tom ever liked Magnus, not that they admitted it .... Did Magnus ever love me at all?</p><p>At last I heave a sigh and switch on my phone. I have to get back to real life. The phone is flashing with messages, about ten of them from Sam, and for a ridiculous instant I think, Oh my God, he\u2019s psychic, he knows.</p><p>But as I click on them, I immediately realize how stupid I\u2019m being. Of course he\u2019s not texting about my personal life. This all is strictly business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Poppy are you there?

Heads rolling. Press conference this afternoon. Vicks wants to talk to you too.</p><p>Hi Poppy, we need the phone. Can you call me asap?</p> <p>I don\u2019t bother scrolling through the rest of the texts; I press call. A moment later the line is ringing and I feel a spasm of nerves. I have no idea why.</p><p>\u201cHi, Poppy! At last! It\u2019s Poppy.\u201d Sam\u2019s ebullient voice greets me, and I can hear a background hubbub of people. \u201cWe\u2019re all whooping here. You have no idea what your little discovery means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my discovery,\u201d I say honestly. \u201cViolet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if it hadn\u2019t been for you taking Violet\u2019s call and meeting her ... Vicks says, high five! She wants to buy you a drink. We all do.\u201d Sam sounds totally high. \u201cSo, did you get my message? The tech guys here want to look at the phone, in case there\u2019s anything on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Sure. I\u2019ll bring it to your office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that OK?\u201d Sam sounds concerned. \u201cAm I disrupting your day? What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... nothing.\u201d</p><p>Just canceling my wedding. Just feeling like a total fool about everything.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can send a bike\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really.\u201d I force a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll come in straightaway.\u201d</p><p>94 No one needs to know about that blond guy at the freshers\u2019 party.</p> <p>15</p><p>This time I don\u2019t have any trouble getting in to the building\u2014there\u2019s practically a reception committee waiting for me. Sam, Vicks, Robbie, Mark, and a couple more people I don\u2019t recognize are standing by the glass doors, ready with a badge and handshakes and lots of explanations, which last all the way up in the lift and which I only half-follow as they keep interrupting one another. But the gist is as follows: The voice mails are 100 percent incriminating. Several members of the staff were pulled in for questioning. Justin lost his cool and practically admitted everything. Another senior staff member, Phil Stanbridge, is also involved, which everyone\u2019s gobsmacked by. Ed Exton has disappeared off the radar. Lawyers are having meetings. No one\u2019s sure yet whether criminal proceedings will occur, but the point is, Sir Nicholas\u2019s name is cleared. He\u2019s over the moon. Sam\u2019s over the moon.</p><p>ITN is slightly less over the moon, as the story has turned from Government adviser is corrupt into Internal company problem is sorted, but they\u2019re still running a follow-up piece and claiming they were the ones who discovered everything.</p><p>\u201cThe whole company\u2019s going to be shaken up by this,\u201d Sam is saying enthusiastically as we stride along the corridor. \u201cThe lines are going to be redrawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve won,\u201d I venture, and he comes to a halt, smiling as widely as I\u2019ve ever seen him smile.</p><p>\u201cYup. We\u2019ve won.\u201d He resumes walking and ushers me in to his office. \u201cHere she is! The girl herself. Poppy Wyatt.\u201d</p><p>Two guys in jeans get up from the sofa, shake my hand, and introduce themselves as Ted and Marco.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve got the famous phone,\u201d says Marco. \u201cMight I take a look?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I reach into my pocket, produce the phone, and hand it over. For a few moments the guys examine it, pressing buttons, squinting at it, passing it from one to the other.</p><p>There aren\u2019t any more incriminating voice mails on there, I feel like saying. Believe me, I would have mentioned them.</p><p>\u201cYou mind if we keep this?\u201d Marco says at last, looking up.</p><p>\u201c Keep it?\u201d The dismay in my voice is so obvious, he double-takes.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s a company phone, so I assumed ... \u201c</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anymore,\u201d says Sam, frowning. \u201cI gave it to Poppy. It\u2019s hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Marco sucks air through his teeth. He seems a bit flummoxed. \u201cThing is, we\u2019d like to do a thorough examination of it. Could take a while. I could say we\u2019ll let you have it back afterward, but who knows how long that\u2019ll be.... \u201d He glances at Sam for guidance. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m sure we can get you a replacement, top of the range, whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Sam nods. \u201cAny budget.\u201d He grins at me. \u201cYou can get the highest-tech phone available.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want the highest-tech phone available. I want that phone. Our phone. I want to keep it safe, not give it up to be hacked about by technicians.

Come on, Ted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be?\u201d asks Sam, and Ted wrinkles his face.</p><p>\u201cCould be a while. An hour?\u201d</p><p>They disappear out of Sam\u2019s office, and he closes the door. For a minute we just look at each other, and I notice a tiny nick on his cheek. He didn\u2019t have that last night.</p><p>Last night. In an instant I\u2019m transported back to the forest. I\u2019m standing in the dark, with the smell of the peaty ground in my nostrils, with woodland sounds in my ears, with his arms wrapped around me, with his mouth\u2014</p><p>No. Stop it, Poppy. Don\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t remember, or wonder, or ...</p><p>\u201cWhat a day,\u201d I say at last, groping for some nice bland words.</p> <p>\u201cYou said it.\u201d Sam ushers me to the sofa and I sit down awkwardly, feeling like someone who\u2019s doing a job interview. \u201cSo. Now that we\u2019re alone\u2014how are you doing? What about the other stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much to report.\u201d I give a deliberately careless shrug. \u201cOh, except I\u2019m calling my wedding off.\u201d</p><p>As I say the words aloud, I feel slightly sick. How many times am I going to have to utter those words? How many times am I going to have to explain myself? How am I going to cope over the next few days?</p><p>Sam nods, wincing. \u201cOK. That\u2019s pretty grim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanda. I went to see her at her house.

And what was the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all in my head,\u201d I admit. \u201cShe\u2019s actually quite a sweetie. Shame about her son.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while. I feel so surreal. The wedding\u2019s off. I\u2019ve said it aloud, so it must be true. But it feels about as real as Aliens have invaded.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans now?\u201d Sam meets my gaze, and I think I can see another question in his eyes. A question about him and me.</p><p>\u201cDunno,\u201d I say after a pause.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to answer his question silently\u2014but I don\u2019t know if my eyes are doing their job. I don\u2019t know if Sam can understand. After a moment I can\u2019t bear looking at him any longer and quickly lower my head. \u201cTake things slowly, I guess. There\u2019ll be a lot of crap to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve had so much coffee today I\u2019m like a jumping bean, but, on the other hand, I can\u2019t stand this heightened atmosphere. I can\u2019t gauge anything. I can\u2019t read Sam. I don\u2019t know what I expect or want. We\u2019re two people who were briefly thrown together by chance and are now conducting a business transaction. That\u2019s all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So why does my stomach lurch every time he opens his mouth to speak? What on earth am I expecting him to say ?</p><p>\u201cCoffee would be great, thanks. Do you have decaf?\u201d I watch as Sam fiddles with the Nespresso machine on a counter at the side of his office, trying to get the milk frother to work. I think it\u2019s a welcome distraction for both of us.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I say at last, as he jiggles the frother, looking frustrated. \u201cI can have it black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hate black coffee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I laugh in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou told Lucinda once in an email.\u201d He turns, his mouth twisting. \u201cYou think you were the only one who did a little spying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a good memory.\u201d I shrug. \u201cWhat else do you remember?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. As his gaze meets mine, my heart starts a little drumbeat. His eyes are so rich and dark and serious. The more I stare at them, the more I want to stare at them. If he\u2019s thinking what I\u2019m thinking, then\u2014</p><p>No. Stop it, Poppy. Of course he\u2019s not. And I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m thinking, not exactly ...</p> <p>\u201cActually, don\u2019t worry about the coffee.\u201d I get to my feet abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ll head out for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Sam sounds taken aback.</p><p>\u201cYes, I don\u2019t want to get in your way.\u201d I avoid his eyes as I pass him. \u201cI\u2019ve got errands to run. See you in an hour.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t run any errands. I don\u2019t have the impetus. My future\u2019s been derailed, and I know I\u2019m going to have to take some action\u2014but at the moment I can\u2019t face dealing with it. From Sam\u2019s office I wander as far as St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. I sit on the steps in a shaft of sunshine, watching the tourists, pretending I\u2019m on holiday from my own life. Then, at last, I make my way back.</p><p>Sam is on a call as I\u2019m shown in to his office, and he nods at me, gesturing apologetically at the phone.</p><p>\u201cKnock knock!\u201d Ted\u2019s head appears around the door, and I start. \u201cAll done. We had three operatives on it.\u201d He comes into the room, holding a massive sheaf of A4 paper. \u201cOnly trouble is, we\u2019ve had to print each text on a separate piece of paper. It\u2019s like ruddy War and Peace. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow.\u201d I can\u2019t believe how many pieces of paper he\u2019s holding. I surely can\u2019t have sent that many texts and emails? I mean, I\u2019ve only had the phone for a matter of days.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Ted puts the sheets down on the table with a businesslike air and separates them into three bundles. \u201cOne of the lads has been sorting them as we\u2019ve gone along. These are all Sam\u2019s. Business emails, so forth. In-box, out-box, drafts, everything. Sam, here you go.\u201d He holds them out as Sam gets up from his desk.</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks,\u201d says Sam, flipping through them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve printed out the attachments as well. They should all be on your computer too, Sam, but just in case... . And these are yours, Poppy.\u201d He pats a second bundle. \u201cEverything should be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Thanks.\u201d I leaf through the papers.</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s this third pile.\u201d Ted wrinkles his brow as though in puzzlement. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure what to do about this. It\u2019s ... it\u2019s both of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sam looks up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your correspondence to each other. All the texts and emails and whatnot that you sent backward and forward. In chronological order.\u201d Ted shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know which of you wants it or whether we should chuck them\u2014are they important at all?\u201d</p> <p>He puts the pile of papers down, and I stare at the top sheet in disbelief. It\u2019s a grainy photograph of me in a mirror, holding the phone and making the Brownie sign. I\u2019d forgotten I ever did that. I turn to the next page to find a single printed text from Sam:</p><p>I could send this to the police and have you arrested.</p><p>Then, on the following page, is my answer:</p><p>I really, really appreciate it. Thx </p><p>That feels like a million years ago now. When Sam was just a stranger at the other end of a phone line. When I\u2019d never met him, had no idea what he was like.... I sense a movement at my shoulder. Sam has come over to look too.</p><p>\u201cStrange, seeing it all printed out,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nod.</p><p>I come to a picture of manky teeth and we simultaneously snort with laughter.</p><p>\u201cQuite a few pictures of teeth, aren\u2019t there?\u201d says Ted, eyeing us curiously. \u201cWe wondered what that was all about. In dental care, are you, Poppy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d I leaf through the pages, mesmerized.

I\u2019ve worked it out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I begin, but the frother starts emitting hot milk with such a loud hissing, there\u2019s no point even trying to speak.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d He hands me a cup.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ... you want these?\u201d He gestures at the pile of papers.</p><p>I feel a kind of heat rising from my feet, and I take a sip of coffee, playing for time.

He scans the screen, then scowls. \u201cOh Jesus. Oh bloody hell. This is all I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I say in alarm. \u201cIs it about the voice mails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d He regards me from under lowered brows. \u201cWhat the hell did you send to Willow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him, bewildered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the warpath about some email from you. Why the hell were you emailing Willow, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t!\u201d I stare at him, perplexed. \u201cI would never email her! I don\u2019t even know her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not what she says\u2014\u201d He breaks off as his phone bleeps again. \u201cOK. Here we are ... Recognize that?\u201d He passes it to me and I start reading.</p><p>FFS, Willow the Witch, can\u2019t you LEAVE SAM ALONE AND STOP WRITING IN OBNOXIOUS CAPITALS? And just FYI: You are not Sam\u2019s girlfriend. So who cares what he was doing with some \u201ccutesy\u201d girl last night? Why don\u2019t you get a life?????</p><p>A cold feeling is creeping over me.</p><p>OK. Maybe I did type something like that this morning, while I was on the tube to Sam\u2019s office. Just out of irritation at yet another rant from Willow. Just to vent a little. But I didn\u2019t send it. I mean, of course I didn\u2019t send it. I would never, ever have sent it.</p><p>Oh God ...</p><p>\u201cI ... um ... \u201d My mouth is dry as I finally raise my head. \u201cI might possibly have written that as a joke. And accidentally pressed send. Totally by mistake. I mean, I didn\u2019t intend to,\u201d I add, to make it crystal clear. \u201cI never would have done it on purpose. \u201d</p><p>I scan the words again and imagine Willow reading them. She must have hit the roof. I almost wish I\u2019d been there to see it.

This isn\u2019t anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>He isn\u2019t even looking at me. He\u2019s typing on his phone.

Reasons I can\u2019t even admit to myself. My stomach is churning with humiliation. Who was I kidding ?</p><p>\u201cBecause ... you weren\u2019t honest!\u201d The words burst from me at last. \u201cYou gave me all this rubbish about \u2018It\u2019s over and Willow should understand that.\u2019 How can she understand anything if you react like this? You\u2019re acting as if she\u2019s still a major part of your life and you\u2019re still responsible for her. And that tells me you\u2019re not over her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is all absolute bullshit.\u201d He looks livid.</p><p>\u201cSo why not tell her to stop pestering you? Why not finish it once and for all and get closure? Is it because you don\u2019t want closure, Sam?\u201d My voice rises in agitation. \u201cDo you enjoy your weirdo, standoff relationship?\u201d</p><p>Now Sam is breathing hard too. \u201cYou have no right to comment on something you understand nothing about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d I give a sarcastic little laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re right.

I feel erratic and out of control. All sorts of deep dark feelings are coming to the surface. I hadn\u2019t fully admitted my hopes to myself. I hadn\u2019t realized quite how much I\u2019d assumed ...</p> <p>Anyway. I\u2019ve been a deluded fool and I need to get out of here as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I take a deep breath and somehow muster a smile. \u201cSorry.

I\u2019ve got a wedding to cancel, people to give minor heart attacks to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Poppy.\u201d Sam\u2019s voice stops me, and I turn around. \u201cI just want to say ... thanks.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes meet mine, and for a moment my prickly, defensive shell is pierced. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSame.\u201d I nod, a lump in my throat. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I lift a hand in final farewell and walk away down the corridor.

Don\u2019t look back.</p><p>By the time I reach the street, my face is lightly spattered with tears and I\u2019m fizzing with furious, agitated thoughts\u2014although who I\u2019m most furious at I\u2019m not sure. Maybe myself.</p><p>But there\u2019s one way I can make myself feel better. Within half an hour I\u2019ve visited an Orange shop, signed up for the most expensive, full-on contract going, and am in possession of a slick, state-of-the-art iPhone. Ted said \u201cany budget\u201d\u2014well, I\u2019ve taken him at his word.</p> <p>And now I\u2019ve got to christen it. I head out of the shop to an open, paved area away from the traffic. I dial Magnus\u2019s number and give a satisfied nod when it goes straight to voice mail. That\u2019s what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cOK, you little shit. \u201d I imbue the word with as much venom as I can manage. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Lucinda. I know it all. I know you slept with her, I know you proposed to her, I know this ring has been round the houses, I know you\u2019re a lying scumbag, and, just so you know\u2014the wedding\u2019s off. Did you hear that? Off. So I hope you can find another good use for your waistcoat. And your life. See you, Magnus. Not.\u201d</p><p>There are moments in life that the white-chocolate Magnum ice cream was invented for, and this is one of them.96</p><p>I can\u2019t face the phone calls yet. I can\u2019t face telling the vicar, or my brothers, or any of my friends. I\u2019m too battered. I need to restore my energies first. And so, by the time I\u2019ve reached home, I have a plan.</p><p>Tonight: watch comfort DVDs, eat Magnums, cry a lot. Hair mask.97</p> <p>Tomorrow: break news to world that wedding is canceled, deal with fallout, watch Annalise try not to whoop with joy, etcetera, etcetera.</p><p>I\u2019ve been texting my new mobile number to everyone I know, and a few friendly texts have already come back\u2014but I haven\u2019t mentioned the wedding to anyone. It can all wait till tomorrow.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to watch anything with weddings in it, obviously,98 so in the end I plump for cartoons, which turn out to be the biggest tearjerkers of the lot. I watch Toy Story 3, 99 Up, 100 and by midnight I\u2019m on Finding Nemo. I\u2019m curled up on the sofa in my ancient pajamas and furry throw, with the white wine within easy reach, my hair all oily with conditioning mask and the puffiest eyes in the universe. Finding Nemo always makes me cry anyway, but this time I\u2019m a sniveling wreck before Nemo\u2019s even lost. 101 I\u2019m wondering if I should find something else to watch which is less savage and brutal, when the buzzer sounds.</p><p>Which is weird. I\u2019m not expecting anyone. Unless ... are Toby and Tom a day early? It would be just like them to arrive at midnight, straight off some cheapie coach. The Entryphone is conveniently within reach from the sofa, so I pull the receiver down, pause Finding Nemo, and tentatively say, \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Magnus.\u201d</p><p>Magnus?</p> <p>I sit up straight on the sofa as though I\u2019ve had an electric shock. Magnus. Here. On my doorstep. Has he heard the message?</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I swallow, trying to pull myself together. \u201cI thought you were in Bruges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So why didn\u2019t you use your key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might have changed the locks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I brush a lock of hair out of my tearstained eyes. So he has heard the message. \u201cWell ... I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come up, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p> <p>I put the receiver down and look around. Shit. It\u2019s a pigsty in here. For one panicked instant I feel an urge to jump up, dispose of the Magnum wrappers, wash off my hair mask, plump up the cushions, shove on some eyeliner, and find some attractive matching loungewear. That\u2019s what Annalise would do.</p><p>And maybe that\u2019s what stops me. Who cares if I\u2019ve got puffy eyes and a hair mask? I\u2019m not marrying this man, so it\u2019s irrelevant what I look like.102</p><p>I hear his key in the lock and defiantly put Finding Nemo back on. I\u2019m not pausing my life for him. I\u2019ve done enough of that already. I turn the volume up slightly and fill my wineglass higher. I\u2019m not offering him any, so he needn\u2019t expect it. Or a Magnum.103</p><p>The door makes a familiar squeaking sound and I know he\u2019s in the room, but I keep my gaze resolutely fixed on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I shrug, as though to say \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>In my peripheral vision I can see Magnus exhale. He looks a teeny bit nervous.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d I can play this game too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoppy.

OK. I made a mistake. Hands up. I\u2019ll admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA \u2018mistake\u2019?\u201d I echo sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cYes, a mistake! I\u2019m not perfect, OK?\u201d He thrusts his fingers through his hair in a frustrated gesture. \u201cIs that what you expect out of a man? Perfection? You want a flawless man? Because, believe me, that man doesn\u2019t exist. And if that\u2019s why you\u2019re calling off this wedding, because I made one simple error ... \u201d He holds his hands out, his eyes reflecting the colored light of the TV. \u201cI\u2019m human, Poppy. I\u2019m a flawed, imperfect human being.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a flawless man,\u201d I snap. \u201cI want a man who doesn\u2019t sleep with my wedding planner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t choose our flaws, unfortunately. And I\u2019ve regretted my weakness over and over again.\u201d</p><p>How is he managing to sound all noble, like he\u2019s the victim here?</p><p>\u201cWell, poor old you.\u201d I turn up the volume of Finding Nemo, but, to my surprise, Magnus grabs the remote and switches it off. I blink at him in the sudden silence.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, you can\u2019t be serious. You can\u2019t want to call everything off for one tiny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not only that.\u201d I feel an old, burning hurt in my chest. \u201cYou never told me about all your other fianc\u00e9es. You never told me you\u2019d proposed to Lucinda. I thought that ring was special. Your mum\u2019s got it, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have proposed to other girls,\u201d he says slowly. \u201cBut now I can\u2019t think why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you loved them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says with a sudden fierceness. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I was nuts. Poppy, you and I\u2014we\u2019re different. We could make it. I know we could. We just have to get through the wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet through it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d He breathes out impatiently. \u201cLook, come on, Poppy. The wedding\u2019s all set up. It\u2019s all arranged. It\u2019s not about what happened with Lucinda, it\u2019s about you and me. We can do it. I want to do it. I really want to do this.\u201d He\u2019s speaking with such fervor, I stare at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cMagnus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill this change your mind?\u201d To my astonishment, he sinks down on one knee beside the sofa and reaches in his pocket. I stare speechlessly as he opens a little jewelry box. Inside is a ring made of twisted golden strands, with a tiny diamond perched at the side.</p><p>\u201cWhere ... where did that come from?\u201d I can hardly find my voice.</p> <p>\u201cI bought it for you in Bruges.\u201d He clears his throat, as though embarrassed to admit it. \u201cI was walking along the street one day. Saw it in a window, thought of you.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. Magnus bought a ring for me. Specially for me. I can hear Wanda\u2019s voice in my head: When he really wants to commit to someone, he\u2019ll find a ring for himself. He\u2019ll choose something carefully. Give it some thought.</p><p>But I can\u2019t relax.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you choose this ring?\u201d I probe. \u201cWhy did it make you think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe strands of gold.\u201d He gives an abashed smile. \u201cThey reminded me of your hair. Not the color, obviously,\u201d he amends quickly. \u201cThe shine.\u201d</p><p>That was a good answer. Quite romantic. I raise my eyes and he gives me a hopeful, lopsided smile.</p><p>Oh God. When Magnus is sweet and puppy-dog like, he\u2019s almost irrestistible.</p><p>Thoughts are still spinning round my head. So he made a mistake. A big, big mistake. Am I going to throw away everything for that? Am I so perfect myself? Let\u2019s face it, twenty-four hours ago my arms were wrapped around another man in a wood.</p><p>I feel a tiny pang in my chest at the thought of Sam and give myself a mental shakedown. Stop. Don\u2019t go there. I got carried away by the situation, that\u2019s all. Maybe Magnus did too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Magnus is watching me eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nods. \u201cIt\u2019s exquisite.

There\u2019s a brand-new email from</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p> <p>My heart skips a beat. I sent Sam my new number this afternoon, just so that he had it. And at the last minute I added, Sorry about this afternoon, with a couple of kisses. Simply to clear the air. Now he\u2019s answering me. At midnight. What does he want to say? With trembling fingers, my thoughts veering onto wild possibilities, I click on the message.</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d Magnus sounds a little affronted. \u201cSweets? Could we focus?\u201d</p><p>Sam is delighted to have received your email. He\u2019ll get back to you as soon as he possibly can. Meanwhile, thanks for your interest.</p><p>I feel a sting of humiliation as I read the words. The brush-off email. He got his PA to send me the brush-off email.</p><p>I suddenly remember him, that time in the restaurant: You must have a brush-off email. They come in pretty useful for fending off unwanted advances too. Well, he couldn\u2019t be any clearer than that, could he?</p> <p>And now there\u2019s more than a tiny pang in my chest\u2014there\u2019s a real wrenching pain. I was so stupid. What did I think ? At least Magnus didn\u2019t delude himself that he and Lucinda were anything more than a casual fling. In some ways he stayed more faithful than I did. I mean, if Magnus even knew the half of what\u2019s been going on these last few days ...</p><p>\u201cPoppy?\u201d Magnus is peering at me. \u201cBad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I toss the phone onto the sofa and somehow find a dazzling smile. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We all make stupid mistakes. We all get carried away. We all get distracted by things which aren\u2019t ... which aren\u2019t real. But the point is ... \u201d I\u2019m running out of steam here.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d prompts Magnus gently.</p><p>\u201cThe point is ... you bought me a ring. Yourself.\u201d</p><p>As I say the words, my thoughts seem to come together and consolidate into something firm. All my deluded dreams fall away. This is reality, right here in front of me. I know what I want now. I take the ring out of the box and examine it for a moment, the blood beating hard in my head. \u201cYou chose it for me yourself. And I love it. And, Magnus ... yes.\u201d</p> <p>I meet Magnus\u2019s gaze head-on, suddenly not caring about Sam, wanting to take my life forward, away from here, to somewhere new.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He peers at me as though not sure what he\u2019s hearing.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I nod.</p><p>In silence, Magnus takes the ring from me. He lifts up my left hand and slides it onto my ring finger.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe it. I\u2019m getting married.</p><p>95 Artistic license.</p><p>96 Even the fact that its name reminds of the very person I want to forget doesn\u2019t put me off.</p><p>97 I might as well stick to the regimen.</p> <p>98 Which rules out most of my DVDs, it turns out.</p><p>99 Weepfest.</p><p>100 Total weepfest.</p><p>101 What kind of movie starts with a mother fish and all her little glowy eggs being eaten by a shark, FFS? It\u2019s supposed to be for children.</p><p>102 NB: Shouldn\u2019t it be irrelevant anyway what I look like?</p><p>103 Because I\u2019ve eaten them all.</p><p>16</p><p>Magnus doesn\u2019t believe in superstitions. He\u2019s just like his father. So even though it\u2019s our wedding day today\u2014even though everyone knows it\u2019s bad luck\u2014he stayed at my place last night. When I told him he should go to his parents\u2019 house, he got all sulky and said I couldn\u2019t be so ridiculous and why would he pack up all his stuff for one night? Then he added, \u201cSurely the only people who believe in that kind of stuff are people with\u2014\u201d</p><p>At which point he stopped himself. But I know he was going to say \u201cweak minds.\u201d It\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t continue, or there would have been a major bust-up. As it is, I\u2019m still feeling quite stroppy with him. Which isn\u2019t exactly ideal on your wedding day. I should be feeling all starry-eyed. I shouldn\u2019t be leaning out of the kitchen every five minutes, saying, \u201cAnd another thing you always do ... \u201d</p><p>I now know exactly why they started the tradition of being apart the night before your wedding. It\u2019s nothing about romance, or sex, or being chaste, or whatever. It\u2019s so you don\u2019t have a row and stomp up the aisle seething at your bridegroom, planning all the home truths you\u2019re going to tell him as soon as you get this wedding bit out of the way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was going to make him sleep in the sitting room, but Toby and Tom were in there in sleeping bags.104 At least I\u2019ve made him promise to leave the house before I get into my wedding dress. I mean, that would be the limit.</p><p>As I pour myself a cup of coffee, I can hear him declaiming in the bathroom, and I feel another flinch of irritation. He\u2019s practicing his speech. Here. In the flat. Isn\u2019t his speech supposed to be a surprise ? Does he know anything about weddings? I approach the bathroom door, ready to give him an earful\u2014then pause. I might as well listen to a snippet.</p><p>The door is slightly ajar, and I peer through the gap to see him in his dressing gown, addressing himself in the mirror.

Here I am.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a swig of something, which looks like a gin and tonic, and gazes belligerently at himself.</p><p>\u201cHere I am. Married, OK? Married. \u201d</p><p>I peer at him uncertainly. I don\u2019t know quite what\u2019s wrong about this speech, but something is. There\u2019s some small detail that feels wrong ... something amiss ... something that jars ...</p><p>I\u2019ve got it. He doesn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>Why doesn\u2019t he look happy? It\u2019s his wedding day.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it.\u201d He lifts his glass at the mirror, glowering. \u201cSo all you people who said I couldn\u2019t can fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagnus!\u201d I can\u2019t help exclaiming in shock. \u201cYou can\u2019t say \u2018fuck off\u2019 in your wedding speech!\u201d Magnus\u2019s face jolts, and his belligerent air instantly vanishes as he whips round. \u201cPoppy! Sweets! I didn\u2019t know you could hear me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your speech?\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cNo! Not exactly.\u201d He takes a deep swig of his drink. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, haven\u2019t you written it yet?\u201d I eye his glass. \u201cIs that a gin and tonic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m allowed a gin and tonic on my wedding day, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>The belligerent air is creeping back. What is wrong with him?</p><p>If I was in one of those glossy luxury-kitchen American TV dramas, I\u2019d go up to him now and take his arm and say gently, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great day, honey.\u201d And his face would soften and he\u2019d say, \u201cI know,\u201d and we\u2019d kiss, and I would have diffused the tension with my loving tact and charm.</p><p>But I\u2019m not in the mood. If he can be belligerent, so can I.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I scowl. \u201cGet pissed. Great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to get pissed. Jesus. But I\u2019ve got have something to take the edge off the\u2014\u201d He stops abruptly, and I stare at him in shock. Where exactly was he heading with that sentence?</p><p>Off the ordeal ? Off the pain ?</p><p>I think his mind is working the same way, because he quickly finishes the sentence. \u201c\u2014the thrill. I need to take the edge off the thrill, or I\u2019ll be far too hyper to concentrate. Sweets, you look beautiful. Gorgeous hair. You\u2019ll look spectacular.\u201d</p><p>His old engaging manner has returned in full force, like the sun coming out from behind a cloud.</p> <p>\u201cMy hair hasn\u2019t even been done yet,\u201d I say, with a grudging smile. \u201cThe hairdresser\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t let him ruin it.\u201d He gathers the ends together and kisses them. \u201cI\u2019ll get out of your way. See you at the church!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I stare after him, feeling a bit unsettled.</p><p>And I\u2019m unsettled for the rest of the morning. It\u2019s not exactly that I\u2019m worried. It\u2019s more that I don\u2019t know if I should be worried. I mean, let\u2019s look at the facts. One moment Magnus is all over me, begging me to marry him\u2014then he gets stroppy, as though I\u2019m forcing him into it with a shotgun. Is it just jitters? Is this what men are always like on their wedding day? Should I tolerate it as normal male behavior, like when he gets a cold and starts Googling nose cancer symptoms discharge nostrils ?105</p><p>If Dad were alive, I could ask him.</p><p>But that\u2019s a thought path I really can\u2019t let myself go down, not today, or I\u2019ll be a mess. I blink hard and scrub at my nose with a tissue. Come on, Poppy. Brighten up. Stop inventing problems that don\u2019t exist. I\u2019m getting married!</p><p>Toby and Tom emerge from their cocoons just as the hairdresser arrives. They make monster cups of tea in mugs which they brought themselves,106 then instantly start bantering with the hairdresser and putting rollers in their hair and making me fall about with laughter. I wish for the zillionth time that I saw more of them. Then they disappear off to have breakfast at a caf\u00e9, and Ruby and Annalise arrive two hours early because they couldn\u2019t wait, and the hairdresser announces he\u2019s ready, and my aunt Trudy rings from her mobile, saying they\u2019re nearly here and her tights have laddered, is there anywhere she can buy a new pair?107 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then we\u2019re into a blur of hair dryers blasting, nails being painted, makeup being done, hair being put up, flowers arriving, dresses being put on, dresses being taken off to go to the loo, sandwiches being delivered, and a near spray-tan disaster (it was actually just a blotch of coffee on Annalise\u2019s knee). Somehow, it\u2019s two o\u2019clock before I realize it, and the cars are here and I\u2019m standing in front of the mirror in my dress and veil. Tom and Toby are standing on either side of me, so handsome in their morning coats that I have to blink away the tears again. Annalise and Ruby have already left for the church. This is it. My last few moments as a single girl.</p><p>\u201cMum and Dad would have been so proud of you,\u201d says Toby gruffly. \u201cAmazing dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I try to shrug nonchalantly.</p><p>I suppose I look OK, as brides go. My dress is really long and slim, with a low back and tiny bits of lace on the sleeves. My hair\u2019s in a chignon.108 My veil is gossamer light, and I\u2019ve got a beaded headdress and a gorgeous posy of lilies. But somehow, just like Magnus this morning, something seems amiss ...</p> <p>It\u2019s my expression, I suddenly realize with dismay. It isn\u2019t right. My eyes are tense and my mouth keeps twitching downward and I\u2019m not radiant. I try baring my teeth at myself in a broad smile\u2014but now I look freaky, like some kind of scary clown-bride.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d Tom is watching me curiously.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I pull at my veil, trying to bunch it round my face more. The point is, it doesn\u2019t matter what my expression is like. Everyone will be looking at my train.</p><p>\u201cHey, sis.\u201d Toby glances at Tom as though for approval. \u201cSo you know, if you did change your mind, we\u2019d be totally cool. We\u2019d help you do a getaway. We\u2019ve discussed it, haven\u2019t we, Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour-thirty from St. Pancras.\u201d Tom nods. \u201cGets you to Paris in time for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo a getaway?\u201d I stare at him in dismay. \u201cWhat do you mean? Why would you plan a getaway? Don\u2019t you like Magnus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Waoh! Never said that.\u201d Toby lifts his hands defensively. \u201cJust ... putting it out there. Giving you the option. We see it as our job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t see it as your job.\u201d I speak more sharply than I meant to. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the papers when I was out, by the way,\u201d adds Tom, proffering a stack of newspapers. \u201cYou want to have a read in the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I recoil in horror. \u201cOf course not! I\u2019ll get newsprint on my dress!\u201d</p><p>Only my little brother could suggest reading the newspaper on the way to my own wedding. As if, it\u2019ll be so boring we\u2019d better have some entertainment.</p> <p>Having said that, I can\u2019t help flicking through the Guardian quickly as Toby goes for a quick final bathroom break. There\u2019s a picture of Sam on page 5, under the headline SCANDAL ROCKS BUSINESS WORLD, and as soon as I see it, my stomach clenches tightly.</p><p>But less tightly than before. I\u2019m sure of it.</p><p>The car is a black Rolls Royce limousine, which looks pretty amazing in my nondescript Balham street, and a small crowd of neighbors has gathered to watch as I come out. I do a little twirl and everyone claps as I get into the car. We set off, and I feel like a proper, glowing, radiant bride.</p><p>Except I can\u2019t look that radiant and glowing, because as we\u2019re driving along Buckingham Palace Road, Tom leans forward and says, \u201cPoppy? Are you carsick or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d I scowl at him.</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d says Toby, peering at me dubiously. \u201cKind of ... green.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, green.\u201d Tom\u2019s face lights up. \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant. Like you\u2019re about to hurl. Are you about to hurl?\u201d</p><p>That is so typical of brothers. Why couldn\u2019t I have had sisters, who would tell me I looked beautiful and lend me their blusher?</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not about to hurl! And it doesn\u2019t matter what I look like.\u201d I turn my face away. \u201cNo one will be able to see through my veil.\u201d My iPhone beeps, and I haul it out of my little bridal bag. It\u2019s a text from Annalise:</p><p>Don\u2019t go up Park Lane! Accident! We\u2019re stuck!</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I lean forward to the driver. \u201cThere\u2019s an accident on Park Lane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight you are.\u201d he nods. \u201cWe\u2019ll avoid that route, then.\u201d</p><p>As we swing around into a little side road, I\u2019m aware of Tom and Toby exchanging glances.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Toby says soothingly. \u201cJust sit back and relax. Shall I tell you some jokes, take your mind off it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c No. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window, watching the streets go by. And suddenly, before I feel quite ready, we\u2019ve arrived. The church bells are pealing with a single, rhythmic tone as we get out of the car. A couple of late guests I don\u2019t recognize are running up the steps, the woman clutching her hat. They smile at me, and I give a self-conscious nod.</p><p>It\u2019s for real. I\u2019m actually doing this. This is the happiest day of my life. I should remember every moment. Especially how happy I am.</p><p>Tom surveys me and grimaces. \u201cPops, you look awful. I\u2019ll tell the vicar you\u2019re ill.\u201d He barges straight past me into the church.</p> <p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t! I\u2019m not ill!\u201d I exclaim furiously, but it\u2019s too late. He\u2019s on a mission. Sure enough, a few moments later Reverend Fox is hurrying out of the church, an anxious look on his face.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness, your brother\u2019s right,\u201d he says as soon as he sees me. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a few minutes to compose yourself alone before we begin the service?\u201d He\u2019s ushering me into a small side room. \u201cSit down a moment, have a glass of water, perhaps eat a biscuit? There are some in the church hall. We need to wait for the bridesmaids anyway. I gather they\u2019ve been held up in traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look out for them on the street,\u201d says Tom. \u201cThey won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the biscuits,\u201d chimes in Toby. \u201cWill you be all right, sis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>They all head out and I\u2019m left alone in the silent room. A tiny mirror is perched on a shelf, and as I look into it I wince. I do look sick. What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>My iPhone dings and I peer at it in surprise. I\u2019ve got a text from Mrs. Randall.</p><p>6\u20134, 6\u20132. Thank you, Poppy!</p><p>She did it! She got back on the tennis court! This is the best thing I\u2019ve heard all day. And all of a sudden I wish I were at work, away from here, absorbed in the process of treating someone, doing something useful\u2014</p> <p>No. Stop. Don\u2019t be stupid, Poppy. How can you wish you were at work on your wedding day? I must be some sort of freak. No other brides wish they were at the office. None of the bridal magazines carry articles on \u201cHow to Look Radiant Rather than Like You Want to Vomit\u201d.</p><p>Another text has dinged into my phone, but this one is from Annalise.</p><p>Finally!!!! We\u2019re on the move! Are you there already?</p><p>OK. Let\u2019s focus on the here and now. The simple act of texting a reply makes me feel more relaxed.</p><p>Just arrived.</p><p>An instant later she replies:</p><p>Argh! Going as quick as we can. Anyway, you\u2019re supposed to be late. It\u2019s good luck. Have you still got your blue garter on?</p><p>Annalise was so obsessed by me wearing a blue garter that she brought along three different choices this morning. I\u2019m sorry, what are garters all about? To be frank, I could really do without a length of tight elastic cutting off my leg circulation right now\u2014but I promised her faithfully I\u2019d keep it on.</p> <p>Of course! Even though my leg will probably fall off. Nice surprise for Magnus on the wedding night.</p><p>I smile as I send the text. It\u2019s cheering me up, having this stupid conversation. I put my iPhone down, have a drink of water, and take a deep breath. OK. I\u2019m feeling better. The iPhone dings with a new text, and I pick it up to see what Annalise has replied\u2014</p><p>But it\u2019s from Sam Mobile.</p><p>For a few instants I can\u2019t move. My stomach is moiling around as though I\u2019m a teenager. Oh God. This is pathetic. It\u2019s mortifying. I see the word Sam and I go to pieces.</p><p>Half of me wants to ignore it. What do I care what he\u2019s got to say? Why should I give one iota of head space or time to him, when it\u2019s my wedding day and I have other things to focus on?</p><p>But I know I\u2019ll never get through the wedding with an unopened text burning a hole in my iPhone. I open it as calmly as I can, bearing in mind that my fingers can hardly function\u2014and it\u2019s a one-word Sam special.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Hi ? What\u2019s that supposed to mean, for God\u2019s sake?</p><p>Well, I\u2019m not going to be rude. I\u2019ll text back a similarly effusive response.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>A moment later there\u2019s another ding:</p><p>This a good time?</p><p>What?</p><p>Is he for real? Or is he being sarcastic? Or\u2014</p><p>Then I realize. Of course. He thinks I canceled the wedding. He doesn\u2019t know. He has no idea.</p><p>And suddenly I see his text in a new light. He\u2019s not making a point. He\u2019s just saying hi.</p><p>I swallow hard, trying to work out what to put. Somehow I can\u2019t bear to tell him what I\u2019m doing. Not straight out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not really.</p><p>I\u2019ll be brief, then. You were right and I was wrong.</p><p>I stare at his words, perplexed. Right about what? Slowly, I type:</p><p>What do you mean?</p> <p>Almost immediately, his reply dings into the iPhone.</p><p>About Willow. You were right and I was wrong. I\u2019m sorry I reacted badly. I didn\u2019t want you to be right, but you were. I spoke to her.</p><p>What did you say?</p><p>Told her it was over, finito. Stop the emails or I\u2019ll take out a stalking injunction.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe it.</p> <p>How did she react?</p><p>She was pretty shocked.</p><p>I bet.</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while. A fresh text from Annalise has arrived on my iPhone, but I don\u2019t open it. I can\u2019t bear to break the thread between Sam and me. I\u2019m gripping my iPhone tightly, peering at the screen, waiting to see if he\u2019ll text again. He has to text again ...</p><p>And then there\u2019s a beep.</p><p>Can\u2019t be an easy day for you. Today was supposed to be the wedding day, right?</p> <p>My insides seem to plunge. What do I answer? What?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well, here\u2019s something to cheer you up.</p><p>Cheer me up? I\u2019m peering at the screen, puzzled, when a photo text suddenly arrives, which makes me laugh in surprise. It\u2019s a picture of Sam sitting in a dentist\u2019s chair. He\u2019s smiling widely and wearing a cartoon sticker on his lapel that says, I was a good dental patient!!</p><p>He did that for me, flashes through my head before I can stop it. He went to the dentist for me.</p><p>No. Don\u2019t be stupid. He went for his teeth. I hesitate, then type:</p><p>You\u2019re right, that did cheer me up. Well done. About time!</p><p>An instant later he replies:</p> <p>Are you free for a cup of coffee?</p><p>And to my horror, with no warning, tears start pressing at my eyes. How can he call now and ask me for a cup of coffee? How can he not realize that things have moved on? What did he think I would do? As I type, my thumbs are jerky and agitated.</p><p>You brushed me off.</p><p>What?</p><p>You sent me the brush off email.</p><p>I never send emails, you know that. Must have been my PA. She\u2019s too efficient.</p><p>He didn\u2019t send it?</p><p>OK, now I can\u2019t cope. I\u2019m going to cry, or laugh hysterically, or something. I had it all sorted in my mind. I knew where everything was and where everything stood. Now my head\u2019s a maelstrom again.</p><p>The iPhone beeps with a follow-up text from Sam:</p><p>You\u2019re not offended, are you?</p><p>I close my eyes. I have to explain. But what do I\u2014How do I\u2014</p><p>At last, without even opening my eyes, I text:</p><p>You don\u2019t understand.</p><p>What don\u2019t I understand?</p><p>I can\u2019t bear to type the words. Somehow I just can\u2019t do it. Instead, I stretch out my arm as far as it will go, take a photo of myself, then examine the result.</p><p>Yes. It\u2019s all there in the shot: my veil, my headdress, a glimpse of my wedding dress, the corner of my lily bouquet. There\u2019s absolutely no doubt as to what\u2019s going on.</p><p>I press Sam Mobile and then send. There. It\u2019s gone through the ether. Now he knows. I\u2019ll probably never hear from him again after this. That\u2019s it. It was a strange little encounter between two people, and this is the end. With a sigh, I sink down into the chair. The bells above have stopped pealing, and there\u2019s a strange, still quietness in the room.</p><p>Until suddenly the beeps start. Frantic and continuous, like an emergency siren. I pick up my iPhone in shock, and they\u2019re stacking up in my in-box: text after text after text, all from Sam.</p><p>No.</p><p>No no no no no.</p><p>Stop.</p><p>You can\u2019t.</p><p>Are you serious?</p><p>Poppy, why?</p><p>My breaths are short and ragged as I read his words. I wasn\u2019t intending to get into a conversation, but at last I can\u2019t stand it anymore, I have to reply.</p><p>What do you expect, I just walk away? 200 people are sitting here waiting.</p><p>Immediately, Sam\u2019s reply comes firing back:</p><p>You think he loves you?</p><p>I twist the ring of gold strands round and round my right-hand finger, trying desperately to find a path through all the contradictory thoughts thrusting their way into my head. Does Magnus love me? I mean ... what is love? No one knows what love is, exactly. No one can define it. No one can prove it. But if someone chooses a ring especially for you in Bruges, that\u2019s got to be a good start, hasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I think Sam must have been poised for my answer, his replies comes shooting back so quickly, three in a row.</p><p>No.</p><p>You\u2019re wrong.</p><p>Stop. Stop. Stop. No. No.</p><p>I want to scream at him. It\u2019s not fair. He can\u2019t say all this now. He can\u2019t shake me up now.</p><p>Well, what I am supposed to do???</p><p>I send it just as the door opens. It\u2019s the Reverend Fox, followed by Toby, Tom, Annalise, and Ruby, all talking at once in an excited babble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God!

They once took my luggage off the plane I was on, just because I was trying these jeans on and I didn\u2019t hear the announcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a mirror? I\u2019ve got to do my lip gloss again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoppy, we got you some biscuits\u2014\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t want biscuits! She\u2019s got to be slim for her big moment!\u201d Annalise swoops down on me. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to your veil? It\u2019s all bunched up. And your dress is crooked!

Hey, Felix wanted to say a quick hello. Is that OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d</p><p>I feel powerless, standing here with everyone milling around me. I can\u2019t even physically move, because Annalise is still adjusting my train.

There\u2019s a new text from Sam in my in-box. His reply. Part of me is so desperate to read it, I almost can\u2019t contain my hands.</p><p>But another part is telling me to stop. Don\u2019t go there. How can I read it now, as I\u2019m about to walk up the aisle? It\u2019ll mess me up. I\u2019m here at my wedding day, surrounded by friends and family. This is my real life. Not some guy I\u2019m connected to through the ether. It\u2019s time to say goodbye. It\u2019s time to cut this thread.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Annalise.\u201d I turn the iPhone off and gaze at it for a moment as the light dies away. There\u2019s no one in there anymore. It\u2019s just a dead, blank metal box.</p><p>I hand it to Annalise and she thrusts it into her bra.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re holding your flowers too high.\u201d She frowns at me. \u201cYou look really tense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I avoid her gaze.</p><p>\u201cHey, guess what?\u201d Ruby comes rustling up in her dress. \u201cI forgot to tell you: We\u2019re getting a celebrity patient! That businessman who\u2019s been all over the news. Sir Nicholas something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Sir Nicholas Murray?\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d She beams. \u201cHis assistant phoned up and booked a session with me! Said I\u2019d been recommended by someone whose opinion he regards very highly. Who on earth d\u2019you think that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve ... I\u2019ve no idea,\u201d I manage.</p> <p>I\u2019m so touched. And a bit freaked. Never in a million years did I think that Sir Nicholas would take me up on my recommendation. How can I face him again? What if he mentions Sam? What if\u2014</p><p>No. Stop it, Poppy. By the time I see Sir Nicholas again, I\u2019ll be a married woman. The whole bizarre little episode will be long forgotten. It\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll alert the organist that we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d says Reverend Fox. \u201cTake your places for the procession, everyone.\u201d</p><p>Annalise and Ruby make their way to their places behind me. Tom and Toby are flanking me, each with an arm loosely crooked in mine. There\u2019s a knock at the door, and Felix\u2019s owlish face peers round.</p><p>\u201cPoppy, you look amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks! Come in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thought I\u2019d wish you luck.\u201d He heads toward me, skirting my dress hem carefully with his feet. \u201cAnd say I\u2019m so chuffed you\u2019re joining the family. We all are. My parents think you\u2019re brilliant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say, trying to hide my dubious tone. \u201cBoth your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d He nods fervently. \u201cThey love you. They were so gutted when they heard it was all off.\u201d</p><p>\u201c Off? \u2019 echo four astonished voices, all at once.</p><p>\u201cWas the wedding off?\u201d says Tom.</p><p>\u201cWhen was it off?\u201d demands Annalise. \u201cYou never told us, Poppy! Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><p>Great. This is all I need, the third degree from my entire wedding party.</p><p>\u201cIt was only temporary.\u201d I try to downplay it. \u201cYou know.

Everyone has them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum gave Magnus such a hard time.\u201d Felix\u2019s eyes gleam behind his glasses. \u201cShe said he was a fool and he\u2019d never find anyone better than you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I can\u2019t help feeling a glow.</p><p>\u201cOh, she was livid.\u201d Felix looks highly entertained. \u201cShe practically threw the ring at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threw the emerald ring?\u201d I say in astonishment. That ring is worth thousands. Surely even Wanda wouldn\u2019t start chucking it around the room.</p><p>\u201cNo, the gold twisty ring. That ring.\u201d He nods at my hand. \u201cWhen she was getting it out of her dressing table for Magnus. She threw it at him and cut his forehead.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cNot badly, of course.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at him, frozen. What did he just say? Wanda got the gold twisty ring out of her dressing table?</p><p>\u201cI thought ... \u201d I try to sound relaxed. \u201cI thought Magnus bought it in Bruges.\u201d</p><p>Felix looks blank. \u201cOh no. It\u2019s Mum\u2019s. Was Mum\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I lick my dry lips. \u201cSo, Felix, what happened exactly? Why did she give it to him? I wish I\u2019d been there!\u201d I try to sound lighthearted. \u201cTell me the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Felix screws up his eyes, as though trying to recall. \u201cMum told Magnus not to bother trying to give you that emerald ring again. And she got out the gold ring and said she couldn\u2019t wait to have you as a daughter-in-law. Then Dad said, \u2018Why are you bothering? It\u2019s obvious Magnus doesn\u2019t have the sticking power for a marriage,\u2019 and Magnus got in a fury with him and said, yes, he does, and Dad said, \u2018Look at the Birmingham job,\u2019 and they had this massive argument like they always do and then ... we got a takeaway supper.\u201d He blinks. \u201cThat was pretty much it.\u201d</p> <p>Behind me, Annalise is leaning forward to listen. \u201cSo that\u2019s why you switched rings. I knew you weren\u2019t allergic to emeralds.\u201d</p><p>This is Wanda\u2019s ring. Magnus didn\u2019t buy it especially for me at all. As I stare at my hand, I feel a bit sick. Then something else occurs to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat Birmingham job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. The one he quit. Dad always gives Magnus a hard time for being a quitter. Sorry, I thought you knew.\u201d Felix is eyeing me curiously as loud organ chords from above make us all jump. \u201cOh, we\u2019re starting. I\u2019d better beetle off. See you in there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, OK.\u201d Somehow I manage to nod. But I feel as though I\u2019m on another planet. I need to digest all this.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Reverend Fox is at the door, beckoning us out. As we arrive at the back of the church, I can\u2019t help gasping. It\u2019s filled with spectacular flower arrangements, and rows of people in hats, and a crackling air of expectation. I can just glimpse the back of Magnus\u2019s head, right at the front.</p> <p>Magnus. The thought makes my stomach turn over. I can\u2019t\u2014I need time to think\u2014</p><p>But I don\u2019t have any time. The organ piece is gathering momentum. The choir suddenly crashes in with a triumphant chord. The Reverend Fox has already disappeared up the aisle. The fairground ride has begun, and I\u2019m on it.</p><p>\u201cAll right?\u201d Toby grins across at Tom. \u201cDon\u2019t trip her up, Bigfoot.\u201d</p><p>And we\u2019re off. We\u2019re moving up the aisle, and people are smiling at me, and I\u2019m aiming for a serene, happy gaze, but, inside, my thoughts are about as serene as the particles whizzing about in CERN.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter ... . it\u2019s only a ring ... . I\u2019m overreacting ... . But he lied to me ... .</p><p>Oh, wow, look at Wanda\u2019s hat ... .</p><p>God this music is amazing, Lucinda was right to get the choir ...</p><p>What job in Birmingham? Why did he never tell me about that?</p> <p>Am I gliding? Shit. OK, that\u2019s better ... .</p><p>Come on, Poppy. Let\u2019s get some perspective. You have a great relationship with Magnus. Whether he bought you the ring himself or not is irrelevant. Some ancient job in Birmingham is irrelevant. And as for Sam\u2014</p><p>No. Forget Sam. This is reality. This is my wedding. It\u2019s my wedding, and I can\u2019t even focus on it properly. What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>I\u2019m going to do it. I can do it. Yes. Yes. Bring it on ... .</p><p>Why the hell does Magnus look so sweaty?</p><p>As I arrive at the altar, all other thoughts are temporarily overcome by this last one. I can\u2019t help gaping at him in dismay. He looks terrible. If I look like I\u2019m sick, then he looks like he\u2019s got malaria.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He gives me a weedy smile. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I whisper as I hand my bouquet to Ruby.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be OK?\u201d he retorts defensively.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t seem quite the right answer, but I can\u2019t exactly challenge him on it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The music has stopped, and Reverend Fox is addressing the congregation with an ebullient beam. He looks as though he absolutely loves taking weddings.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved. We are gathered here in the sight of God ... \u201d</p><p>As I hear the familiar words echoing around the church, I start to relax. OK. Here we go. This is what it\u2019s all about. This is what I\u2019ve been looking forward to. The pledges. The vows. The ancient, magical words which have been repeated under this roof so many times, for generations and generations.</p><p>So maybe we\u2019ve had some blips and jitters in the run-up to our wedding. What couple doesn\u2019t? But if we can just focus on our vows, if we can just make them special ...</p> <p>\u201cMagnus.\u201d Reverend Fox turns to Magnus, and there\u2019s a rustle of anticipation in the congregation. \u201cWilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after God\u2019s ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?\u201d</p><p>Magnus has a slightly glazed look in his eye, and he\u2019s breathing heavily. He looks as though he\u2019s psyching himself up for the hundred-meter Olympic final.</p><p>\u201cMagnus?\u201d prompts Reverend Fox.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says, almost to himself. \u201cOK. Here goes. I can do this.\u201d He takes an almighty deep breath and, in a loud, dramatic voice which rises to the ceiling, announces proudly: \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I do?</p> <p>I do?</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he listening ?</p><p>\u201cMagnus,\u201d I whisper with a meaningful edge. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018I do.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Magnus peers at me, clearly baffled. \u201cOf course it\u2019s \u2018I do.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I feel a surge of irritation. He wasn\u2019t listening to a single word. He just said \u201cI do\u2019 because it\u2019s what they say in American films. I knew we should have rehearsed our vows. I should have ignored Antony\u2019s snarky comments and made Magnus run through them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018I do,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018I will\u2019!\u201d I\u2019m trying not to sound as upset as I feel. \u201cDidn\u2019t you listen to the question? \u2018Wilt thou.\u2019 \u2018 Wilt thou. \u2019 \u201d</p> <p>\u201c Oh. \u201d Magnus\u2019s brow clears in understanding. \u201cI get it. Sorry. I will, then. Although it hardly matters, surely,\u201d he adds with a shrug.</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cShall we resume?\u201d Reverend Fox is saying hurriedly. \u201cPoppy.\u201d He beams at me. \u201cWilt thou take this man to thy wedded husband ... \u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t let that go.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Reverend Fox.\u201d I lift a hand. \u201cOne more thing. Sorry.\u201d For good measure, I swivel round to the congregation. \u201cI just need to clear up a tiny point. I won\u2019t be a moment.\u201d I turn back to Magnus and say in a furious undertone, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018it hardly matters\u2019? Of course it matters! It\u2019s a question. You\u2019re supposed to answer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweets, I think that\u2019s taking it a little literally.\u201d Magnus is looking distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cCan we crack on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we cannot crack on! It\u2019s a literal question! Wilt thou take me? A question. What do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Magnus shrugs again. \u201cYou know. A symbol.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s as though he\u2019s lit my fuse paper. How can he say that? He knows how important the vows are to me.</p><p>\u201cNot everything in life is a bloody symbol !\u201d I explode. \u201cIt\u2019s a real, proper question, and you didn\u2019t answer it properly! Don\u2019t you mean anything you\u2019re saying here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Poppy.\u201d Magnus lowers his voice. \u201cIs this really the time?\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s he suggesting, that we say the vows and then discuss whether we meant them or not afterward ?</p><p>OK, so perhaps we should have discussed our vows before we were standing at the altar. I can see that now. If I could go back in time, I\u2019d do it differently. But I can\u2019t. It\u2019s now or never. And, in my defense, Magnus knew what the wedding vows were, didn\u2019t he? I mean, I haven\u2019t exactly sprung them on him, have I? They\u2019re not exactly a secret, are they?</p><p>\u201cYes, it is!\u201d My voice rises with agitation. \u201cThis would be the time! Right now would be the time!\u201d I swing round to face the congregation, who all gaze at me, agog. \u201cHands up: Who thinks that, at a wedding, the groom should mean his vows?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s absolute silence. Then, to my astonishment, Antony slowly raises his hand into the air, followed by Wanda, looking sheepish. Seeing them, Annalise and Ruby shoot their hands up. Within about thirty seconds, all the pews are full of waving hands. Tom and Toby each have both hands up, and so have my aunt and uncle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reverend Fox looks utterly flummoxed by events.</p><p>\u201cI do mean them,\u201d says Magnus, but he sounds so lame and unconvincing, even Reverend Fox winces.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I turn to him. \u201cForsaking all others? In sickness and in health? Till death us do part? You\u2019re absolutely sure about that, are you? Or did you just want to prove to everyone that you can go through with a wedding?\u201d</p><p>And although I wasn\u2019t planning to say that, as soon as the words are out of my mouth, they feel true.</p> <p>That\u2019s what this is. Everything falls into place. His belligerent speech this morning. His sweaty forehead. Even his proposal. No wonder he waited only a month. This was never about him and me, it was about proving a point. Maybe this is all about his father calling him a quitter. Or his zillion previous proposals. God knows. But the whole thing has been wrong from the start. It\u2019s been back to front. And I believed in it because I wanted to.</p><p>I can suddenly feel the pressing of tears behind my eyes. But I refuse to crumble.</p><p>\u201cMagnus,\u201d I say more gently. \u201cListen. There\u2019s no point doing this. Don\u2019t marry me just to prove you\u2019re not a quitter. Because you will quit, sooner or later. Whatever your intentions are. It\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubbish,\u201d he says fiercely.</p><p>\u201cYou will. You don\u2019t love me enough for the long haul.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t, Magnus,\u201d I say, almost wearily. \u201cI don\u2019t light up your life like I should. And you don\u2019t light up mine.\u201d I pause. \u201cNot enough. Not enough for forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Magnus looks shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d I can see that I\u2019ve pricked his vanity.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry, Poppy,\u201d he says, clearly in a huff. \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the way you feel too!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cBe honest! Magnus, you and I, we\u2019re not destined to be together forever. We\u2019re not the main event. I think we\u2019re ... \u201d I screw up my face, trying to think of a way to put it. \u201cI think we\u2019re each other\u2019s footnotes.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s silence. Magnus looks as though he wants to find a riposte but can\u2019t. I touch his hand, then turn to the vicar. \u201cReverend Fox, I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ve wasted your time. I think we should probably call it a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Reverend Fox. \u201cGoodness. I see.\u201d He mops his head with his handkerchief, looking flustered. \u201cAre you sure ... Perhaps a five-minute chat in the vestry ... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll fix it,\u201d I say gently. \u201cI think we\u2019re done. Don\u2019t you, Magnus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Magnus looks genuinely gutted, and for a moment I wonder\u2014</p><p>No. There\u2019s no doubt. I\u2019m doing the right thing.</p><p>\u201cWell ... what shall we do now?\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cShall we still have the reception?\u201d</p><p>Magnus looks uncertain\u2014then nods. \u201cMight as well. We\u2019ve paid for it.\u201d</p><p>I step down from the altar, then pause. OK, this is awkward. We didn\u2019t rehearse this. The congregation is all watching, agog, to see what happens next.</p> <p>\u201cSo ... um ... should I ...\u201d I turn to Magnus. \u201cI mean, we can\u2019t exactly walk down the aisle together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go first.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>Reverend Fox is signaling at the organist, who suddenly starts playing the bridal march.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I squeak in horror. \u201cNo music! Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo sorry!\u201d Reverend Fox makes hasty cut-it gestures. \u201cI was trying to signal Don\u2019t play. Mrs. Fortescue is a little deaf, I\u2019m afraid. She may not have followed exactly what\u2019s been going on.\u201d</p><p>This is such a shambles. I don\u2019t even know whether to hold my flowers or not. In the end, I grab them from Ruby, who gives me a sympathetic squeeze on the arm, while Annalise whispers, \u201cAre you insane ?\u201d</p><p>The music has finally petered out, so I start making my way back down the aisle in silence, avoiding everyone\u2019s eyes and prickling all over with self-consciousness. Oh God, this is hideous. There should be an exit strategy for this eventuality. There should be an option in the Book of Common Prayer: Procession for Ye Bride Who Chang-ed Her Minde.</p><p>No one\u2019s talking as I make my way along the stone aisle. Everyone\u2019s watching me, riveted. But I\u2019m aware of phones being turned on, from the cacophony of bleepy noises up and down the pews. Great. I expect there\u2019ll be a race to see who can post it on Facebook. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly a woman at the end of a pew thrusts a hand out in front of me.

I\u2019m Magnus\u2019s godmother, Margaret. I don\u2019t know many people here. But a text arrived in my phone during the service, from someone called Sam Roxton. At least ... it\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s about you. It says: If you happen to be at the wedding of Poppy Wyatt\u2014 \u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a loud gasp behind her. \u201cI\u2019ve got that message too!\u201d a girl exclaims. \u201cExactly the same! If you happen to be at the wedding of Poppy Wyatt\u2014 \u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too! Same here!\u201d Voices start chiming in around the church. \u201cI\u2019ve just got it! If you happen to be at the wedding of Poppy Wyatt ...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m too bewildered to speak. What\u2019s going on? Has Sam been texting the wedding guests? More and more hands are flying up; more and more phones are bleeping; more and more people are exclaiming.</p> <p>Has he texted everyone at the wedding ?</p><p>\u201cHave we all got the same text?\u201d Margaret looks around the congregation in disbelief. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s see. If you\u2019ve got the message in your phone, read it out. I\u2019ll count us in. One, two, three: If you happen ...\u201d</p><p>As the rumble of voices starts, I feel faint. This can\u2019t be real. There\u2019s a crowd of two hundred people at this wedding, and most are joining in, reading aloud from their phones in unison. As the words echo round the church, it sounds like a mass prayer or a football chant or something.</p><p>\u201c ... to be at the wedding of Poppy Wyatt, I\u2019d like to ask a favor. Stop it. Stop her. Hold it off. Delay it. She\u2019s doing the wrong thing. At least get her to think about it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m transfixed in the aisle, clutching my bouquet, my heart thudding. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s done this. I can\u2019t believe it. Where did he get all the phone numbers from? Lucinda?</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you why. As a clever man once said: A treasure such as this should not be left in the hands of Philistines. And Poppy is a treasure, though she doesn\u2019t realize it.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help glancing over at Antony, who is holding his phone and has raised his eyebrows very high.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t time to talk or discuss or be reasonable. Which is why I\u2019m taking this extreme measure. And I hope you will too. Anything you can do. Anything you can say. The wedding is wrong. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>As the reading comes to an end, everyone seems slightly shell-shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2014\u201d Magnus is striding down from the altar. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t answer. Sam\u2019s words are going round and round my head. I want to grab someone\u2019s phone and read them through again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to reply!\u201d exclaims Margaret. \u201c Who\u2019s this? \u201d she says aloud as she taps at her phone. \u201cAre you her lover?\u201d She presses send with a dramatic flourish, and there\u2019s a rapt silence in the church, till her phone suddenly bleeps. \u201cHe\u2019s answered!\u201d She pauses for effect, then reads out: \u201cLover? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if she loves me. I don\u2019t know if I love her.\u201d</p><p>Deep down inside, I feel a crushing disappointment. Of course he doesn\u2019t love me. He just thinks I shouldn\u2019t marry Magnus. He\u2019s just putting right what he sees as a wrong. That\u2019s a totally different thing. It doesn\u2019t mean he has any feelings for me whatsoever. Let alone\u2014</p><p>\u201cAll I can say is, she\u2019s the one I think about.\u201d Margaret pauses, and her voice softens as she reads. \u201cAll the time. She\u2019s the voice I want to hear. She\u2019s the face I hope to see.\u201d</p> <p>My throat is full of lumps. I\u2019m swallowing desperately, trying to keep my composure. He\u2019s the one I think about. All the time. He\u2019s the voice I want to hear. When my phone bleeps, I hope it\u2019s him.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Magnus sounds incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes, who is he?\u201d pipes up Annalise from beside the altar, and there\u2019s a ripple of laughter around the church.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just ... a guy. I found his phone... .\u201d I trail off helplessly.</p><p>I can\u2019t even begin to describe who Sam is and what we\u2019ve been to each other.</p><p>Margaret\u2019s phone bleeps again, and the hubbub dies down to an expectant hush. \u201cIt\u2019s from him,\u201d she says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d I can hardly trust my voice.</p><p>The church is so silent and still, I can almost hear my own heart beating.</p><p>\u201cIt says, And I\u2019ll be standing outside the church.

He\u2019s standing in the doorway of a Starbucks, in jeans and a dark-blue shirt. As he meets my gaze, his eyes crinkle, but he doesn\u2019t smile. He keeps looking at my hands. His eyes have a huge question burning in them.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t he know? Can\u2019t he tell the answer?</p><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d breathes Annalise beside me. \u201cDreamy.

His head is bowed and he doesn\u2019t look up, even when he\u2019s finished, even when the text arrives in my phone.</p><p>So are you married?</p><p>I carefully line up my phone and take a picture of my bare left finger.</p><p>Sam Mobile.</p><p>Send.</p><p>A crowd of wedding guests is jostling behind me to see, but I don\u2019t move my head an inch. My eyes are glued on Sam, so that I see the reaction on his face as the text arrives. I see his brow relax; I see his face expand into the most brilliant, joyous smile. And finally he looks up at me.</p><p>I could go to bed in that smile.</p><p>Now he\u2019s texting again.</p> <p>Want a cup of coffee?</p><p>\u201cPoppy.\u201d A voice in my ear interrupts me, and I turn to see Wanda peering anxiously at me from under her hat, which looks like a massive dead moth. \u201cPoppy, I\u2019m sorry. I acted dishonorably and selfishly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say, momentarily confused.</p><p>\u201cThe second ring. I told Magnus ... At least, I suggested that he might\u2014\u201d Wanda breaks off, wincing.</p><p>\u201cI know. You told Magnus to pretend he\u2019d chosen the ring for me especially, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I touch her arm. \u201cWanda, I appreciate it. But you\u2019d better have this one back too.\u201d I pull the twisty gold ring off my right hand and give it to her.</p><p>\u201cI would have loved you to join our family,\u201d she says wistfully. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t have clouded my judgment. It was wrong of me.\u201d Her gaze drifts across the road to Sam. \u201cHe\u2019s the one, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>I nod, and her face softens like a crumpled rose petal being released.</p><p>\u201cGo on, then. Go.\u201d</p><p>And without waiting a beat longer, I walk down the steps, across the road, dodging the cars, ignoring the hooting horns, tearing off my veil, until I\u2019m a foot away from Sam. For a moment we just stand there, facing each other, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been sending a few texts,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cA couple.\u201d Sam nods.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d I nod back. \u201cDid Lucinda help out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe turned out to be pretty keen to derail the wedding,\u201d Sam says, looking amused.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. How did you even find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a pretty fancy website.\u201d Sam smiles wryly. \u201cI called her mobile and she was only too eager to help. In fact, she sent the text for me. Didn\u2019t you know that you have some state-of-the-art automatic mechanism to contact all the guests?\u201d</p><p>Lucinda\u2019s text-alert system. It finally came in useful.</p><p>I shift my bouquet to the other hand. I never realized how heavy flowers were.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty fancy outfit for Starbucks.\u201d Sam is eyeing me up and down.</p><p>\u201cI always wear a wedding dress for coffee dates. I think it adds a nice touch, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I glance back at the church and can\u2019t help giggling. The entire congregation seems to have spilled out of the church and is standing on the pavement like an audience.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they waiting to see?\u201d Sam follows my gaze, and I shrug.</p><p>\u201cWho knows? You could always do a dance. Or tell a joke. Or ... kiss the bride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the bride.\u201d He wraps his arms around me and gradually pulls me close. Our noses are practically touching. I can see right into his eyes. I can feel the warmth of his skin. \u201cYou.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl who stole my phone.\u201d His lips brush against the corner of my mouth. \u201cThe thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in a bin. \u201d</p><p>\u201cStill stealing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I begin, but now his mouth is firmly on mine and I can\u2019t speak at all.</p><p>And suddenly life is good.</p><p>I know that things are still uncertain; I know that reality hasn\u2019t gone away. There\u2019ll be explanations and recriminations and messiness. But right now I\u2019m entwined with a man I think I might love. And I haven\u2019t married the man I know I don\u2019t love. And from where I\u2019m looking, that\u2019s pretty good going, for now.</p><p>At last we draw away from each other, and across the road I can hear Annalise whooping in appreciation. Which is pretty tacky of her, but that\u2019s just Annalise.</p><p>\u201cI brought you some reading matter, by the way,\u201d Sam says. \u201cIn case there was a dull moment.\u201d</p> <p>He reaches inside his jacket and produces a bundle of coffee-stained A4 papers. And as I see them, there\u2019s a thickening in my chest. He kept them. Even after we parted so badly. He kept our texts.</p><p>\u201cAny good?\u201d I manage a nonchalant tone.</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d He flips through them, then lifts his head. \u201cLooking forward to the sequel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d And now the way he\u2019s looking at me is making me tingle all over. \u201cSo, do you know what happens next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... I have a fair idea.\u201d He trails his fingers down my neck, and I feel an instant bolt of lust. I am totally ready for my honeymoon night.109 I don\u2019t need the champagne or the canap\u00e9s or the three-course dinner or the first dance. Or even the last dance.</p><p>But, on the other hand, there\u2019s the small matter of two hundred people standing across the street, watching me, as though waiting for instructions. Some of them have traveled for miles. I can\u2019t bail out on them.</p> <p>\u201cSo ... we\u2019ve got this party,\u201d I say tentatively to Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, all my friends and family, all at once, in a really intimidating bunch, plus all the friends and family of the guy I was supposed to marry today. And sugared almonds. You want to come?\u201d</p><p>Sam raises his eyebrows. \u201cYou think Magnus will shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno.\u201d I squint at Magnus across the road. He\u2019s standing there, along with everyone else, watching us. But as far as I can tell, he doesn\u2019t look too homicidal.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Shall I send him a text and ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like.\u201d Sam shrugs, taking out his own phone.</p><p>Magnus. This guy I\u2019m standing with is Sam. I know this isn\u2019t exactly usual\u2014but can I bring him to our wedding reception? Poppy xxx</p><p>PS\u2014why don\u2019t you bring a guest too??</p><p>A moment later I get a response.</p> <p>If you must. Mag</p><p>Which isn\u2019t exactly enthusiastic but doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s planning to shoot anyone either.</p><p>I\u2019m about to put my phone away when it bleeps again, and I stare in surprise. It\u2019s a text from Sam. He must have just sent it a few seconds ago. Without looking at him, I open it to see:</p><p>It\u2019s a heart. He sent me a love heart. Without even saying anything. Like a little secret.</p><p>My eyes feel hot, but somehow I manage to stay calm as I type my reply:</p><p>Me too.</p><p>I want to add more ... but, no. More can come later.</p><p>I press send then look up with a bright smile, take Sam by the arm, and draw up my train out of the dusty pavement.</p><p>\u201cSo. Come on, then. Let\u2019s hit my wedding.\u201d</p><p>THE END </p> </body></html>"]
